@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity0 is offering unmarried parents who want to tie the knot the option of having baptisms for their children at the same time			1
statistics show an increasing number of couples live together before their wedding day , the church says			2
the offer is a response to demand after church - sponsored research showed that 20 percent of couples getting married in a church already had children , whether together or from a previous relationship , the church said			1
it is also a way to make the church more welcoming for unmarried parents and their families , a church spokesman said			1
the church is issuing new guidelines to priests that encourage them to offer parents the option of having a baptism or thanksgiving service for their child 's birth at the same time as their wedding			1
the guidelines also advise priests on how to perform the dual ceremonies , the spokesman said			0
" patterns of relationship and marriage within society are presenting new opportunities for the church , " said @entity43 , @entity44 , who chairs the @entity0 's @entity45			0
" we are therefore offering guidance on how thanksgiving for the gift of a child , or indeed baptism , might be incorporated within a marriage service so that the church can respond pastorally to our changing world if a priest feels it would be advisable to offer this option			0
" what do you think of the offer ? have your say it has always been possible to hold both ceremonies at the same time , but priests did n't always know how to go about it , spokesman @entity67 said			0
the guidelines make it easier for priests to know how to offer and perform the dual ceremonies , he said			0
research from @entity81 's @entity80 shows that for many couples , having children is now the first major milestone of adult life , ahead of marriage -- in contrast to their parents ' generation , the church said			1
statistics also show an increasing number of couples now live together before their wedding day , the church said			0
the @entity0 said it hopes the ideas " will help churches show their welcome for couples with children , and give the whole family a special occasion and a new beginning			2
