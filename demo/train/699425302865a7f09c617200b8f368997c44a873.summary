-- as the saying goes about political parties and their candidates : @entity4 fall in love and republicans fall in line			0
and that 's exactly what republicans are doing , or trying to do			2
but after this combative primary season , watching @entity13 's former @entity12 rivals struggle with ways to endorse their onetime nemesis is painful			1
it 's like they 're trying to find ways to snuggle with @entity20			2
at the very least , the contortions are a tad awkward and unseemly			0
and in the real world ( as opposed to the political world ) , the result is completely unbelievable			0
it 's also a perfect example of why voters do n't trust politicians			1
consider this : @entity29 finally announced his support of @entity13 this week			1
yet in his obvious struggle to find the right words to embrace a man he once called a liar , @entity31 came up with this tortured equation : " i am asked sometimes is @entity13 conservative enough ? and my answer is simple — compared to @entity39 ? this is not a choice between @entity13 and @entity42			1
this is a choice between @entity13 and the most radical leftist president in @entity46 history			1
" not exactly effusive , but certainly supportive , at least compared to these @entity31 words about @entity13 last winter : " why should we expect him to level about anything if he is president ? " or the time he called @entity13 " the most anti-immigrant candidate			1
" or , at a @entity0 debate , when he helpfully pointed out that " i do n't know of any president who has had a @entity55 bank account			0
" well , never mind			0
granted , she dropped out in january and waited a long time to endorse -- until @entity13 was the last man standing			1
and she had him standing right beside her as she finally gave the nod , describing @entity13 as " the last chance we have to keep @entity46 ... from going over the cliff			1
is that really what @entity58 believes ? as @entity68 's @entity67 points out , @entity58 told him before the @entity70 caucuses that " he ( @entity13 ) can not beat @entity39			1
it 's not going to happen			0
" the reason : @entity13 's @entity75 health care plan , which she called " the blueprint for @entity78			1
" that 's exactly what @entity80 had been saying throughout the campaign			0
he 's meeting with @entity13 friday , but cautions against expectations of an endorsement			1
it will come , but probably not until @entity80 extracts some policy concessions , such as a promise that @entity13 will never support health care mandates , according to one @entity80 source			2
and it will be hard for @entity80 to cozy up to the man whom he said would " give the issue of health care away in this election			0
it is too foundational for us to win the election			0
" of course , this is not the first time the vanquished have endorsed their previous opponents			0
( see : @entity102 and @entity39			0
also see : @entity103 endorsing @entity13 circa 2012			2
) but this primary was so divisive — and so personal — the endorsements seem that much more hollow			0
there 's a very good reason : they are			0
conservatives still have a hard time believing @entity13 can beat president @entity39			1
they may be wrong , but it 's what they really believe even if many of them wo n't say it anymore			1
and one more thing : now that all these @entity12 are getting in line to endorse @entity13 , it only serves as a reminder that they did n't endorse him before he had become the presumptive nominee			1
i mean , what was @entity125 waiting for ? come to think of it , maybe distance			0
after all , @entity46 's mayor took to @entity46 's airwaves to declare that @entity31 was " the most electable @entity12 " in december			1
that was when he also told @entity132 , referring to @entity13 , that " i 've never seen a guy ... change his position on so many things so fast , on a dime			2
" in the same interview , @entity125 asked a rhetorical question about how president @entity39 might handle @entity13			2
his prediction : @entity39 would say " this is a man without a core ... i think that is a great vulnerability			0
" as it turns out , there 's plenty of that to go around			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity150 .			2

nearly all the @entity12 primary rivals are now lining up behind @entity13
@entity150 says their contortions are *agonizing* to watch
she says *people* who *lambasted* @entity13 are now claiming he 's their choice
@entity150 : conservatives still doubt he can win , though many wo n't say it now
