@entity0 -- power it up , or leave it behind			0
the @entity4 said sunday that security screeners at overseas airports may ask @entity8 - bound passengers to turn on their electronic devices to prove they work and are n't explosive devices			1
they wo n't allow devices without power on board planes			2
the traveler may then undergo additional screening			0
it 's part of an update to security measures aimed at combating potential new threats from terrorists in the @entity20 and @entity21			1
secretary of homeland security @entity22 directed the @entity4 last week to enhance security at overseas airports that have direct flights to the @entity8			1
the specifics of the enhanced measures were n't originally released , and it is n't known what other measures the @entity4 may employ			1
the @entity4 also would have to coordinate with the foreign governments which provide security at airports in their countries , along with the airlines and private security companies			2
" our job is to ... try to anticipate the next attack , not simply react to the last one			1
and so we continually evaluate the world situation , and we know that there remains a terrorist threat to the @entity8 , and aviation security is a large part of that , " @entity22 told @entity46 's " @entity45			1
" " this is not something to overreact to or over-speculate about , " he said			0
a homeland security official said last week that the changes would primarily focus on airports in @entity21 and the @entity20			0
the effort does not involve changes to what travelers can take aboard flights			0
but passengers may see additional inspections of shoes and electronics , additional use of scanners designed to detect trace amounts of explosives , and another stage of screening at boarding gates , in some cases , the official said			2
the changes came about based on new intelligence on terror groups trying to build new types of improvised explosives that are harder to detect , the official told @entity1			0
while there was no specific threat prompting the enhancements , @entity8 officials are concerned about the possibility that @entity80 might develop bombs which could pass through current security measures undetected			2
since hardening cockpit doors and taking other measures after the 9/11 @entity80 attacks , the @entity8 aviation security focus has shifted primarily from hijackings to plastic and other explosives that can be carried aboard a plane or hidden in baggage			1
the @entity92 @entity91 confirmed wednesday that it is stepping up some of its aviation security measures			0
" for obvious reasons we will not be commenting in detail on those changes			0
the majority of passengers should not experience significant disruption , " a spokesman said			0
" the @entity92 has some of the most robust aviation security measures , and we will continue to take all the steps necessary to ensure that public safety is maintained			0
" the updated security measures only apply to airports overseas , and @entity22 said he does n't think the enhancements will make their way to domestic airports at this time			1
" i believe that we 've taken the appropriate measures to deal with the existing situation and not unnecessarily burden the traveling public , " @entity22 told @entity46			1
tighter security ordered for some @entity8 - bound flights @entity1 's @entity116 and @entity117 contributed to this report .			2

@entity123 : " our job is to ... try to anticipate the next attack , " @entity22 tells @entity46
@entity4 may require passengers en route to @entity8 to turn on their electronics
they want to make sure the devices work and are n't explosives
it 's part of a *series* of new measures aimed at combating potential new threats overseas
