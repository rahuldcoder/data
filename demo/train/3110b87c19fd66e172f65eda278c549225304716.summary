his uncle @entity0 has promised the newest addition to the royal family that he will have " fun " -- and if a centuries old tradition is to be followed , it is an odds on certainty that horse racing will play a prominent role in young @entity11 's future social life			1
a love of horses and thoroughbred racing is ingrained in the @entity15 , and @entity11 's great grandmother @entity16 is a leading owner with a string of top horses			1
" she adores breeding racehorses , " her racing manager @entity19 told @entity20			2
" the @entity24 bloodstock industry is very lucky to have a patron such as the queen			1
" fittingly , the 87 - year - old 's most notable achievement is winning the @entity29 at @entity30 with @entity31 , a four - year - old filly guided by 10 - time @entity24 champion trainer @entity33			1
ridden by @entity34 , @entity31 stormed to victory in the prestigious @entity37 race in june , the first time in its 207 - year history that the @entity24 monarch had owned the winner			1
it added to her earlier triumphs in the @entity44 , the 1,000 and @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			0
derby disappointments only the @entity49 eludes the queen , who saw her latest hope , @entity52 , come home third in 2011 after starting as favorite			2
" she has inherited her father @entity57 's love of the turf , " said @entity54 , spokesman for @entity55			0
the @entity59 had a long , successful affiliation with steeplechase racing , where horses run longer distances than flat horses and have to negotiate jumps or hurdles			2
she died in 2002 at the age of 101 , but during her lifetime had 449 winners in her royal colors			1
a top race at the @entity72 , the @entity73 , is named in her honor			0
but like her daughter , success in the most prestigious event -- the @entity78 , jump racing 's equivalent of the @entity49 -- remained a dream for the @entity59			2
she was cruelly denied success in the 1956 edition when her horse @entity85 , ridden by @entity86 , led on the run - in at @entity88 before falling to the turf unexpectedly			2
it was said the horse became distracted by the ear - shattering noise from a loyal crowd , desperate for a royal winner , and missed a stride			1
' she strives to have winners ' while racing is often called the " @entity98 , " in @entity99 " @entity100 " is just as appropriate			1
according to official records , queen @entity101 is said to have become so excited while watching a race at @entity30 that she broke the window of the @entity105 in a rush to see the finish			2
her great great grand daughter would surely never be guilty of such unseemly behavior , but as @entity31 stormed clear in the final furlong at @entity30 she could be seen with the broadest of smiles and maybe a hint of a tear			0
" it 's a special thrill to win this race for the @entity101 and it will have given her enormous pleasure , " @entity33 said at the time			0
" she really loves this game and it 's a great recreation for her			0
" @entity101 has such a love for her breeding program and this will have been a bigger thrill to win with a filly , rather than a colt			0
she told me it was a very big thrill and thanked everybody involved			0
" her grandson @entity127 put it more succinctly			0
" this is her passion and her life and she 's here every year and she strives to have winners , " he was quoted as saying			2
that passion extends to a day - to - day involvement with her bloodstock and training operation			1
formidable operation " she names all her own horses , i believe -- it gives her fantastic pleasure , planning the whole process , " @entity54 said			0
it is a formidable operation with @entity145 studs at @entity146 and @entity147 in @entity148 and @entity149 in @entity150 , feeding into her training operation with about 25 horses racing each season			1
one of the stallions at @entity146 is former @entity49 winner @entity156 , with the queen part of a syndicate using the horse for breeding			1
she will doubtless be hoping that one of his offspring can deliver her success at @entity165 after the heartbreak of @entity52 's unlucky near miss two years ago			0
the last @entity145 winner of the @entity49 , @entity168 back in 1909 , was owned by @entity170 , who was renowned for his love of racing and the good things in life			1
@entity175 also had success as the @entity177 with @entity178 in 1900 , named in honor of his mother @entity101 's long reign			0
for the current @entity24 head of state it would represent a monumental achievement to emulate this feat , but it is not for lack of knowledge or trying			2
well informed " she is a very well - informed and keen owner , probably the best - informed owner in the country , " said leading trainer @entity189 , who has looked after a number of the queen 's horses , and knows he has to keep them in peak condition			0
the @entity101 's keenness extends to low - key visits in a private capacity to racetracks such as @entity201 , which is in the @entity150 , to check on the progress of her horses			0
" most of the crowd would be unaware she is there , walking around the paddock , possibly wearing a head scarf , " revealed @entity54 , whose organization is responsible for promoting horse racing in @entity99			1
while @entity16 will not hand over the reins of her racing operation anytime soon , @entity54 is confident that she will find a suitable successor			1
" they are a family that understands traditional values and understand the value of succession , " he said			0
" it can be traced back to @entity221 's day			0
" @entity221 designated an area of land near @entity224 to equestrian pursuits in 1711 , and it later became @entity30			0
the @entity226 , a @entity37 race that takes place every year at @entity30 , is named after the monarch who was so influential in the history of thoroughbred racing			2
@entity54 , and the whole of the @entity24 racing industry in the @entity24 , are hoping that the latest edition to the royal family -- @entity11 of @entity236 -- will be just as keen			1
royal patronage they sent a special gift of a teddy bear , dressed in the queen 's racing silks , to the maternity wing of the @entity245 hospital where he was born in july			1
watch : pictures of @entity11 released for now , @entity54 is delighted to have the queen as a figurehead to their sport , particularly as it is now competing for audiences with counter attractions such as the @entity255 and team sports like rugby and cricket			0
" fantastic for us as she has to be the most high - profile figure in @entity99 with a standing all round the world and it is hard for any country in the world to have a more prominent figurehead in their sport , " he said			0
her star horse estimate will likely return to @entity30 on october 19 for the grand finale of the @entity24 flat racing season , the @entity268 , looking to repeat the earlier success on a course on which she has never been beaten , in the @entity275			1
estimate will likely face stiff competition from horses owned by other royal families , with the rulers of the @entity281 , notably @entity283 's @entity282 , whose powerful @entity285 operation has been a major force in @entity24 racing for over 20 years			1
@entity54 believes the royal connections , with long standing owner breeders like the @entity290 and the queen now competing against relative new entrants such as @entity282 , can only serve to maintain interest in sport of the turf in the 21st century			2
" their involvement is a fantastic boost for @entity24 and @entity299 racing , " he said			1
meanwhile , @entity99 's monarch , despite her 87 years , shows no signs of slowing up in her relentless pursuit of thoroughbred perfection .			0
