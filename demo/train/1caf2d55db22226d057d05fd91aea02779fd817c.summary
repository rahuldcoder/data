he was born and raised in the @entity1 , and killed by the @entity1			0
and now from beyond the grave he inspires a new generation of would - be terrorists to attack the @entity1			2
militant cleric @entity5 continues to speak through sermons posted online , and @entity1 officials are investigating whether his words may have influenced @entity11 bombers @entity9 and @entity12			1
a @entity1 government official told @entity15 's @entity14 on tuesday that " the preachings of @entity5 were likely to have been among the videos they watched			1
" a @entity1 government source had previously told @entity15 that @entity12 had claimed the brothers had no connection to overseas @entity23 terrorist groups and were radicalized through the @entity24			1
@entity25 lived in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 before leaving the @entity1 in 2002			0
at one point he met two of the men who would be among the 9/11 hijackers , an encounter later investigated by the @entity34			0
there is no evidence that @entity5 knew of their plans			1
from about 2006 onward he became increasingly influential among would - be jihadists around the world with his eloquent online sermons delivered in fluent and colloquial @entity42			1
@entity25 was killed in a @entity1 drone strike in a remote part of @entity45 in september 2011 , along with another @entity1 , @entity46			0
@entity1 investigators are examining whether the @entity12 brothers downloaded or viewed a bomb formula that appeared in @entity50 , the online @entity51 published by @entity52			1
@entity25 is believed to have been the driving force behind that magazine and @entity46 was its editor			0
the pressure cooker devices exploded in @entity11 had several striking similarities to a design in the first issue of the magazine in the summer of 2010 " how to build a bomb in @entity61			2
" the magazine instructed would - be jihadists in the @entity63 to deploy multiple devices and set them off simultaneously in a crowded space			2
another issue of the magazine published a year ago called for attacks at crowded sports venues			0
the @entity50 recipe " how to build a bomb in your @entity74 " has been linked to multiple @entity23 terrorist plots on both sides of the @entity72			2
it was downloaded by a group of @entity23 extremists plotting to bomb @entity79 in late 2010			1
in july 2011 , an @entity1 @entity81 soldier from @entity82 , @entity83 -- @entity84 -- downloaded the recipe and bought pressure cookers and shotgun shells from which he could extract explosive powder			2
@entity84 was arrested before he had assembled a bomb and was sentenced last year to two consecutive life prison sentences for attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction			2
@entity95 resident @entity94 allegedly began building a pipe bomb using the recipe before being arrested by @entity95 police in november 2011			2
@entity94 was charged with plotting to bomb targets in the @entity1 ; he has pleaded not guilty			2
the emergence of a " jihadist rock star " @entity5 was born in @entity101			1
he spent some time in @entity45 as a teenager before coming back to the @entity1			0
his time in @entity1 helped him speak to radicals in a language they could understand and grasp the vulnerabilities of open societies in the @entity63			0
his sermons were sometimes impassioned and dwelt on the topic of jihad , but many mainstream @entity81 did not then regard him as an extremist			2
after leaving the @entity1 , @entity5 intensified his preaching -- recording @entity114 sermons that became extremely popular among @entity115 across the western world			1
he spent time in @entity79 and was very popular among congregations in more radical mosques with his sermons on the injustices he alleged were being perpetrated by the @entity63 against @entity115			2
as one @entity79 imam later put it , " he left the congregations all revved up with nowhere to go			0
" behind closed doors , it was a different story			0
in small study circles @entity5 spoke out in favor of suicide bombings in the @entity63 , according to one @entity129 imam			1
one such meeting was attended by undercover @entity133 agents , prompting @entity129 authorities to ban him from traveling to the @entity129 , the imam told @entity15			0
@entity136 consumers of @entity5 's videos included the so - called @entity138 18 , who plotted to launch attacks across @entity141 in 2006 , and the @entity129 @entity52 cell that plotted to bomb trans - @entity72 airliners the same year			1
several of those who plotted to attack the @entity146 military base in @entity147 in 2007 were also big fans of the cleric 's sermons			1
and two of the @entity52 terrorist cell that plotted to bomb @entity95 subways in 2009 later admitted they were radicalized by @entity5 's sermons			1
@entity25 eventually resettled in @entity45 , where he made clear to followers that he supported @entity52 's campaign of violence against the @entity1			2
in 2006 , @entity5 was imprisoned by @entity45 authorities and was interviewed by @entity34 officials			1
his former friends have told @entity15 that when @entity5 was released 18 months later he was a changed man , hardened by the experience			1
and he began communicating with admirers around the world			0
one of them was maj. @entity165 of the @entity166 , who had once attended @entity5 's sermons at a mosque in @entity168 , @entity28			1
on december 17 , 2008 , @entity165 sent the cleric the first of what would become a stream of e-mails			2
he wanted to know if @entity5 considered @entity175 soldiers who turned their guns on their fellow soldiers martyrs			1
not long afterward the cleric replied			2
in one e-mail , @entity165 said he could not wait to join @entity179 in the afterlife , where they could have discussions over non-alcoholic wine			0
two @entity34 task forces had reviewed the intercepted e-mails and concluded there were no grounds for action against @entity165 , that the messages could be construed as a legitimate part of his work as an army psychologist			0
but on the morning of november 6 , 2009 , @entity165 gunned down 13 @entity1 soldiers at the @entity82 military base in @entity83 , and those communications were seen in a very different light			0
@entity25 did nothing to distance himself from @entity165 's attack			2
within two days of @entity82 , the cleric wrote on his website : " @entity165 is a hero			0
... the @entity1 is leading the war against terrorism , which in reality is a war against @entity115			0
" by then @entity5 had begun orchestrating a potentially much more deadly plot against the @entity1			1
in the late summer and fall of 2009 he recruited a young @entity207 for the mission , according to sources who were close to @entity5 at the time			1
@entity211 had come to @entity45 in the hope of meeting the cleric			0
according to @entity1 court documents , when the two met they discussed martyrdom and jihad for three days			0
by the end of that time , the young @entity207 told the cleric he was ready for any mission , martyrdom included			0
weeks later , on christmas day 2009 , @entity211 came close to destroying @entity220 on its final descent into @entity222 with an explosive device hidden in his underwear			0
according to the @entity1 government , @entity5 was intimately involved in planning the operation			1
in the following months a new wave of plots emerged linked to the preaching of @entity5			1
on may 1 , 2010 , @entity231 , an @entity1 - @entity232 recruited by the @entity232 @entity233 , attempted to blow up a car bomb in @entity95 's @entity235			1
investigators later discovered that he had been inspired by @entity5 's preaching about violent jihad			1
in october 2010 , @entity5 was involved with a new attempt by @entity52 to blow up @entity1 - bound aircraft by inserting explosive devices in printer cartridges destined for the @entity1			1
investigators later described the hidden devices as very sophisticated and well camouflaged , and the plot was thwarted only thanks to a tip - off from @entity247 intelligence			1
the bombs were intercepted while en route			0
by 2011 , @entity50 magazine had a simple message for followers in the @entity1 : stay where you are and launch attacks at home			0
its reach continued to grow around the world			0
@entity15 has established that the @entity260 wing of the @entity261 , a jihadist group fighting to create an @entity115 state in the region , posted a @entity266 language translation of a 2012 issue on their website , along with videos of @entity5			1
@entity270 posted a link to a video by a local commander of the group -- @entity275 -- on his @entity277 site after traveling to @entity260 in 2012			0
even in death @entity5 's influence has persisted			1
in may 2012 a posthumous article in his name was published in which he sought to justify biological and chemical attacks against the @entity1			0
the magazine proclaimed : " we are still publishing @entity1 's worst nightmare			0
... all of his students will follow his steps and this is how we win			0

though he 's dead , militant cleric @entity5 remains influential
investigators *suspect* the @entity12 brothers *listened* to his sermons online
the brothers might have downloaded bomb - making instructions , officials say
