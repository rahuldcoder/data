@entity0 -- a team of engineers will delay until wednesday their plans to rappel down the sides of the @entity6 , a photographer for the contractor said tuesday , citing bad weather as the cause			1
" they plan to start first thing in the morning , " photographer @entity11 told @entity1 as rain and possible thunderstorms approached			2
the engineers will be looking for damage caused by the august earthquake			2
" the engineering team and the rappelling team , a combination of people from @entity23 in @entity24 as well as from an engineering firm , will come out of the windows at the 500 - foot level , " said @entity19 , spokesman for the @entity20			1
" what they will do is do a very close visual inspection to check to see if there are any smaller cracks that were sustained during the earthquake , " @entity30 said			2
engineers will work " to determine whether those cracks could , in the next couple of years , grow			2
" officials need to " get up close " and search for possible damage , @entity30 said			0
the concerns stem from the august 23 earthquake , which shook much of the @entity42			0
the @entity20 said monday that the interior assessment found the monument is structurally sound			1
" the heaviest damage appears to be concentrated at the very top of the monument , in what is called the pyramidion , where large cracks of up to 1 - 1/4 inch wide developed through stone and mortar joints , " said @entity45 , superintendent of the @entity46			0
daylight is visible through some of the cracks , and rain water has gotten into the monument , which could cause further damage			0
the difficult - access rappelling team -- which includes members of the firm of @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 -- will scale the outside of the structure to get a closer look			1
they will install climbing ropes and safety lines on all four sides , then clip onto those lines , @entity68 said			0
weather permitting , they will climb up the pyramidion and then descend the length of the monument looking for exterior damage			1
on monday , the @entity20 put on its web page video of the interior of the monument that was shot during the earthquake			1
it shows park rangers and tourists rushing down the stairs as debris falls onto the observation deck			1
the video also shows a ranger , @entity90 , helping visitors and remaining calm			1
" she had the presence of mind , she had the composure , to make certain that she got people down to the 490 - foot level and started walking down the stairs , " said @entity30			2
" she showed a lot of courage , in fact , by coming back up to the 500 - foot level to collect the last remaining visitors and to ensure their safety and put their safety ahead of her own in order to get everybody out safely			0
so we 're extremely proud of the work she has done			0
" in a few weeks , after the exterior assessment is completed , the @entity20 expects to come up with a timeline to reopen the monument to the public			1
the @entity6 , built between 1848 and 1884 , is 555 feet , 5 - 1/8 inches tall			0
its walls , 15 - feet thick at the base and 18 - inches at the top , are composed primarily of white marble blocks , according to the @entity20			1
the monument " is not going anywhere , " @entity68 said			0
" it is a testament to the original builders that the monument has withstood not just this earthquake but an even larger one in the late 1800s			0
" @entity1 's @entity128 and @entity129 contributed to this report .			0
