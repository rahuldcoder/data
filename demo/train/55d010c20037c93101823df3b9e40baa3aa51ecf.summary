-- dividing up the newspapers on a recent weekend , my husband asked me if i wanted to see the sports section			0
" no , " i replied jokingly			0
" reading the sports got me into a big argument once			0
this week 's @entity8 marks the 10th and final round of the national brouhaha over admitting women to the @entity12			1
female members will be present for the first time			0
as leader of the @entity16 , i was the standard - bearer for the " girls team " in the controversy over a woman 's place -- not only at @entity12 but in society as a whole -- that raged in the media and around kitchen tables alike for more than a year beginning in 2002			1
the dispute has continued to simmer , mostly out of the public eye , for the past decade			2
although not as loud as it was in 2003 when the council 's petition to then - chairman @entity30 to open the club culminated in a public protest , the argument never went away			2
confined by a sheriff 's directive to a muddy field far from @entity12 's entrance -- with promises of arrest if we moved -- and surrounded by more police than supporters , the protest was roundly ridiculed at the time as a failure			1
it 's true that women did not walk through the gates as equal members that day			1
but the national dialogue during the preceding year , combined with legal action facilitated by the @entity16 in the following years , triggered change that took a decade to mature			2
by the long - view standard , our action was most definitely not a failure			0
there is little doubt that if we had not raised the issue and kept it alive for a decade , women would still be barred from one of the highest profile " off - campus " business venues in the @entity61 , if not the world			1
last summer the gates finally opened a crack and two women -- @entity66 and @entity67 -- were allowed to slip through			1
during the @entity70 a few months earlier , the club and its major sponsor , @entity69 , had drawn their own share of public ridicule when @entity12 refused to grant membership to @entity69 's new ceo @entity74 , though they had always invited her male predecessors			1
@entity69 had meekly acquiesced to the insult , bringing @entity74 to the tournament to " entertain clients " and parading her around the grounds in a pink jacket			0
last year 's @entity69 debacle was a public relations nightmare , but it was not the major reason the club opened to women			1
after all , the original controversy was also a public relations nightmare -- for both @entity12 and its sponsors -- and one that had stayed front and center in the media for a full year			1
nor was current chairman @entity92 responsible for the change , as some speculated			0
he had already been at the helm for six years , and it seems obvious he might not have been chosen without agreeing to continue the club 's no - women policy			1
( the council and our attorneys asked @entity92 for a private meeting shortly after his election			0
) in the aftermath of the original controversy , the @entity16 , in partnership with a major civil rights law firm in @entity108 , helped bring lawsuits for sex discrimination in employment against major corporations whose @entity113 were members of the club			0
we had been hearing from women who worked at these companies since we made the membership list public in 2002			0
it looked like a roster of the @entity121			0
it seems that sex discrimination does not stop at ceo club memberships , but trickles down to front - line management			0
two of our lawsuits -- against @entity128 and the @entity130 division of @entity131 -- netted nearly $ 80 million in settlements to the women			0
the price of membership in @entity12 had just gone up			1
more important , the suits resulted in agreements by the companies not to honor business expenses that are directly or indirectly related to male - only entertainment establishments			0
in effect , they can no longer entertain or hold events at venues that discriminate			0
our project is ongoing , and there are many more companies still represented on the @entity12 roster			2
were sex discrimination lawsuits the bulldozer that finally knocked down @entity12 's tree house ? perhaps not , though surely they contributed			1
in the 10 years since that original protest , the council and our allies also continued to challenge exclusion of women not only at @entity12 , but also everywhere women are left out when important business contacts and deals are made			1
we changed the argument from one about the " rights " of so - called private clubs to one about the " wrongs " of a cadre of industry titans using the fig leaf of such memberships to exclude women , the standard this behavior sets in corporate @entity61 and damage it does to women at all levels			0
public opinion followed , until by 2012 the position of the club and its members was not only indefensible , it was seen as antiquated and ridiculous			0
unfortunately , one action ca n't change ingrained corporate practices overnight			0
women in the @entity121 have made some progress in the last 10 years as top earners , from 5 % to 8 % ; but men still hold 96 % of the ceo spots , from 98 % a decade ago ; and 86.5 % of @entity189 board seats , down from 90 %			2
on the lower rungs , adult women are still the majority of minimum wage earners and the majority of clerical support workers , and the pay gap between women and men working full time and year - round is just under 20 %			0
sex discrimination at work , not only in the executive suites but also up and down the line , is still rampant			0
so , was a decade of struggle to open one golf club to women worth the effort ? was it worth the credible death threats , volumes of vile and vulgar hate mail , and my image on stickers at the bottom of urinals ? for all it represented symbolically , the answer is an unequivocal " yes			1
" @entity221 beliefs about women 's place in society can and must change , and that fight was one part of making it happen			1
arguments like the one over @entity12 matter , because they shine a bright light on the ingrained attitudes that should be no longer acceptable in a civilized society			2
without countless such confrontations -- large and small -- over " a woman 's place " throughout our history , the ranks of women in executive suites , the @entity238 , courtrooms , surgical theaters , the military , and many other places in society would still be close to zero , and the idea of a female president would be as alien as a creature from @entity249			1
let 's hope the club does not make tokens out of its female members , as it appears to have done with its very few men of color			1
if more women follow @entity66 and @entity258 through those vaunted gates and are treated as truly equal with the men -- or more companies refuse to be associated with @entity12 if women are n't treated equally -- it will be the more lasting victory			1
the big argument over female members at @entity12 was never about golf			1
it was about discrimination at the highest levels of @entity61 corporate power and the message that sends about where women belong in business and society			2
until we 're truly equal , we must all continue to fight to change the culture that let it happen in the first place			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity280 .			2

@entity280 : a decade of protests opened @entity12 to women
the fight was n't about golf , she says , it was about women 's " place " in the *corridors* of power
@entity280 : without such protests , women would not be judges , *lawmakers* , troops , *doctors*
@entity280 : let 's hope more women will join @entity67 and @entity66 , and not as tokens
