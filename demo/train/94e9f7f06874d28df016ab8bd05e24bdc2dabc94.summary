-- @entity2 finance ministers last night postponed agreement on @entity5 's long - delayed € 31.3bn aid payment for yet another week as divisions between the @entity7 and @entity8 creditors over how fast @entity10 must reduce its burgeoning debt levels burst into the open			1
@entity12 , the @entity7 chief , and @entity14 , chair of the eurogroup of finance ministers , publicly sparred over whether @entity5 must reduce its debt levels to 120 per cent of economic output by 2020 , long viewed the target to get @entity10 back to a sustainable debt level			1
an agreement between the @entity7 and eurozone governments is essential to releasing the bailout tranche since both creditors disburse financial assistance concurrently			2
in a rare breach , mr @entity14 told a post-meeting press conference the target would be moved to 2022 , prompting ms @entity12 to insist the @entity7 was sticking to the original timeline			1
when mr @entity14 again insisted it would be moved -- " i 'm not joking , " he said -- ms @entity12 appeared exasperated , rolling her eyes and shaking her head			2
" in our view , the appropriate timetable is 120 per cent by 2020 , " ms @entity12 said			2
" we clearly have different views			0
" officials will meet again november 20 in an effort to reach agreement , mr @entity14 said			0
despite the delay , officials insisted @entity5 would not default on thursday , when @entity10 must make a debt payment of about € 5bn without the benefit of international aid			1
@entity5 's ability to raise the money on its own has been cast into doubt after the @entity46 refused to increase the amount of treasury bills it would accept as collateral from @entity5 banks seeking low - interest @entity46 loans			1
without the ability to use treasury bills as collateral , @entity5 banks have little financial incentive to purchase them			0
but @entity55 , the @entity8 's top economic official , said even if the @entity46 did not raise the ceiling of treasury bills it would accept , @entity5 banks had improved their cash position enough that they were expected to purchase the debt anyway , getting over what mr @entity55 termed a " @entity5 fiscal cliff "			1
the @entity64 spat was a public manifestation of a fight that has been simmering behind closed doors for months			0
the @entity7 has insisted the overhauled bailout plan include a credible debt reduction proposal , which may force eurozone countries to accept losses on bailout loans			0
but @entity74 officials believe the @entity7 is being overly pessimistic , arguing @entity5 can grow faster economically and should be given more leeway to meet debt targets			1
according to senior officials , the @entity7 believes that without any relief , @entity5 debt will stand at nearly 150 per cent of gross domestic product by 2020 , while the @entity74 believes it will be just over 140 per cent			1
without agreement on the baseline , officials can not come up with a debt relief plan , which will involve both eurozone governments and the @entity46 giving up cash they had originally been owed by @entity5			2
if the target is moved to 2022 , eurozone governments will have an easier time formulating a plan , since it likely will only involve cutting interest rates on bailout loans			0
standing firm to 2020 may require write downs on those loans , something @entity95 and other creditor countries have refused to do			0
" we started to discuss a certain number of avenues , " mr @entity14 said			0
" my personal feeling is that [ official write downs ] will not be the one that will be privileged			0
