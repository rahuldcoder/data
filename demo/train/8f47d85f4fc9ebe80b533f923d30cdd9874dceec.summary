-- it 's been a year since the @entity3 movement sprang up			1
since then , it has fizzled , but this does not mean that the underlying issues that gave rise to the protests have gone away			2
until last year , mainstream political discourse did not include nearly as much emphasis on such populist concerns as rising income inequality , tax policies that favor the rich , growing influence by large corporate interests in elections and the reckless deregulation of financial institutions that resulted in the 2008 crisis			1
it is hard to miss them now			0
these concerns still impact 99 % of @entity23			1
even if occupy protests have petered out , the movement has affected the political narrative in our country			1
meet the original ' @entity29 ' we can see @entity3 's impact in the current presidential campaign			1
whereas @entity33 's 1996 re-election strategy focused on the idea of " triangulation " -- taking centrist positions on key economic issues to isolate his @entity39 opponent on the right -- president @entity41 has taken on much more of a populist stance , mobilizing his @entity44 base and economically stressed independents against an opponent whom his campaign is depicting as the quintessential representative of the 1 %			1
occupy activists justifiably express skepticism over how much to trust the president 's left - leaning rhetoric when his actual economic policies have been decidedly centrist			2
still , the fact that @entity41 's re-election campaign recognizes the advantage of decrying unfair tax laws and similar policies that affect middle class @entity23 is indicative of how the tone has shifted			1
unfortunately , much of the decline of the @entity62 can also be attributed to the distraction from this year 's election campaigns			2
despite the @entity44 ' mixed record , the unions and many other potential allies necessary in building a real movement have felt obliged to focus their energy on re-electing @entity41 and helping other @entity44 candidates			2
some police repression and serious violations of civil liberties by city authorities certainly crippled the occupy protests as well , as did the media 's tendency to focus too much on its more violent or flaky elements			0
but , this does not mean that all is lost			0
what was the point of the @entity62 ? share your view with @entity85 the @entity86 and other unarmed civil insurrections that have swept the world recently did not start and end during a few dramatic weeks or months when millions of people were on the streets			0
they were the culmination of many years of struggle , often initiated by young radicals engaging in small but creative demonstrations			0
the occupy protesters , even at their greatest numbers , were never able to do what successful movements must do in terms of developing a well - thought - out strategy , clearly articulated political demands , a logical sequencing of tactics and well - trained and disciplined activists who do n't vandalize property or fight cops			0
indeed , the occupy protesters never developed enough of the structural elements necessary to truly be considered a " movement			0
" most importantly , those involved never recognized that colorful protests are no substitute for door - to - door organizing among real people			0
a look back : meet the 99 % the @entity23 has a long history of popular social and economic struggles , from the abolitionists to the @entity120 to the suffragists to the civil rights movement and , throughout much of that history , the trade unions			1
as @entity125 once beckoned his fellow @entity23 : " crush ... the aristocracy of our moneyed corporations which dare already to challenge our government to trial and bid defiance to the laws of our country			0
" if the pressing concerns of the 99 % are not addressed , do n't be surprised if new incarnations of the @entity62 emerge in the near future			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity138 .			0
