@entity0 suffered its second massive power failure in two consecutive days tuesday , depriving as many as 600 million people -- half the country 's population -- of electricity and disrupting transportation networks for hours			1
the first power grid collapse , on monday , was the country 's worst blackout in a decade			1
it affected seven states in northern @entity0 that are home to more than 350 million people			1
tuesday 's failure was even larger , hitting eastern and northeastern areas as well			1
both blackouts cut power in the capital , @entity19 , where residents sweltered			2
several hours later , by 9:30 p.m. , power had been largely restored , the @entity21 reported on its website			1
power in @entity19 and in the northeastern region was fully restored ; electricity was 86 % restored to the northern region , and 79 % restored in the eastern region , it said			1
the two days of disruption in the third - largest @entity31 economy has raised questions about its investment in infrastructure			0
with about 1.2 billion people , @entity0 has the world 's second - largest population , behind @entity39			1
at least 300 trains were held up in the affected regions , said @entity42 , a spokesman for @entity43			0
@entity19 's metro system also suffered delays before power was restored , causing chaos for many travelers			1
traffic signals also were out , resulting in major jams			0
train fire in @entity0 kills 32 ; death toll may rise during the blackout , one traveler in @entity19 told @entity55 that her journey home had taken almost three hours , rather than the usual 40 minutes			1
" long night ahead , with no lights -- i 've got my trusty solar lamp ready for the night , " she said			0
an elderly woman said she would rely on candles and flashlights to get through the outage , which she blamed on poor governance			0
other travelers told @entity55 of ruined plans to visit relatives and long waits at stifling stations			0
miners in the @entity71 of @entity73 state were hit by the blackout too			0
the district 's top administrator , @entity75 , told @entity77 that 150 coal miners were working underground when the outage struck , stopping lifts			0
authorities switched to emergency supplies to run the elevators , he said			0
" all are safe , " @entity84 said about the miners			0
monday 's grid failure struck early tuesday			2
by dawn , many backup power systems had run out of fuel ; power was partially restored after about six hours , authorities said			2
airports and hospitals , running on backup power , remained operational , but many businesses closed , said @entity96 , senior editor for @entity55			0
the cause of the problem was the failure to generate sufficient power to keep pace with surging demand , he said			2
power is considered a luxury in much of @entity0 , where a third of households do n't have enough to power even one light bulb , according to last year 's census			1
they tend to be more common during the summer , when demand rises			0
some of this summer 's increased demand has been caused by farmers using more energy for irrigation and other tasks , in part because rains during this year 's monsoon season , which began june 1 , are down by more than a fifth			1
people are also using air conditioning units more to cope with high humidity			1
the monsoon rains , which last through september but would normally be at their heaviest in july and early august , not only provide rain for agriculture and hydroelectric power , but serve as a natural coolant , said @entity77 meteorologist @entity128			1
humidity exceeding 80 % makes the mid- 90s @entity130 temperatures feel like more than @entity131			0
this makes it harder for buildings to cool at night , and harder for people to cool themselves through evaporation of perspiration , all of which lead to higher energy demands , @entity128 said			1
power minister @entity141 , who has ordered an investigation into monday 's outage , said it had been a decade since an entire grid last failed in north @entity0			2
he said that the cause of this week 's blackouts is not known but that some states , particularly agricultural areas , may have been using more than their share of energy			0
@entity152 , a member of @entity0 's main opposition @entity153 , criticized the government for what he said was " a huge failure of management in the power sector			2
" @entity0 -- the world 's fourth - largest consumer of electricity -- relies on coal for much of its energy but also uses hydroelectric power , which has been affected by the diminished monsoon rains			1
observers say the crisis has exposed the need for @entity0 to update its infrastructure to meet its growing power needs			2
" economic growth is constrained by inadequate infrastructure , " among other factors , the @entity172 's country report on @entity0 says			2
" foreign investment is particularly sought after in power generation , " it adds , as well as areas including telecommunications , roads and mining			0
vulnerability of @entity185 electrical grid a concern four ways the internet could go down @entity190 's @entity189 goes black			0

travelers tell of disrupted journeys
power is largely restored in @entity19 , northern and northeastern @entity0
tuesday 's blackout deprived as much as half the country of 1.2 billion people of power
monsoon rains are down , leading to higher energy demand amid high humidity
