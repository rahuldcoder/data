-- @entity1 supported @entity2 in the presidential race of 2008 , and he 's supporting him again in 2012 -- but not without reservations			1
the multi-platinum @entity6 winner laments , " i wish there was a third party , but right now , i will wholeheartedly support @entity2 -- even if i 'm slightly heartbroken about it			1
" @entity1 spoke with @entity0 's @entity10 in support of " @entity17 , " the sixth consecutive studio album from the @entity13 to debut at number one on the @entity16 chart			1
no other group in @entity16 history has achieved this feat. in the 11 new tracks , @entity1 examines love , lust , the politics of relationships and the politics of politics			1
" @entity32 , " the lead single , is a plea for citizens to shake off their apathy and pull themselves out of the , quote , " mess we 're making			1
" the 45 - year - old singer - songwriter and father of three elaborates on his thoughts and creativity in the @entity39 below			1
@entity0 : your new single , " @entity32			1
" i want to read the first couple lines : " do n't give up , i know you can see all the world and the mess we 're making			1
" those are pretty strong words there			1
@entity1 : we spend a lot of time bickering at great cost , and very little time actually coming up with solutions			1
and i think we misuse our ambition for our own gains and rarely for the betterment of ourselves , and people around us and our environment			1
and i think that 's sort of pathetic and desperate			2
@entity0 : are you angry or just disappointed ? @entity1 : not like @entity61 , but i think that i 'm angry all the time			1
we 've lost our way a little bit , and we blame each other , and we blame @entity66 , and we blame the world and we blame each other			2
but i think we should blame ourselves , and maybe get more things done			2
@entity0 : do you think artists have a responsibility to speak out ? @entity1 : i do n't feel like i 'm standing in a position where i have some right above other people to say what i think			1
we should all be talking to each other about what we think is important -- whether we 're in politics , or whether we 're checking out at a grocery store			2
we should n't put walls up between each other			2
i think we should all talk to our enemies and talk to our friends			2
talk ! that 's the only way we 'll find solutions			2
@entity0 : when we spoke with you in 2009 , you were pretty vocal about racism and the challenges we face			2
@entity1 : when i was a kid growing up in @entity93 , i was pretty unaware of racism			1
i think when we 're young -- before we lose our innocence -- we 're sort of unaware of the more flawed qualities of each other			2
and when i moved to @entity97 and i spent my teen years there ( under apartheid ) , i became acutely aware of racism because it was institutionalized , even though i was on the favored side of the line			2
but when i moved back to @entity103 , i was suddenly so overwhelmed by how present ( it is )			2
it 's so hard for me to even acknowledge @entity103 without talking about race and recent issues -- you know , the genocide of the @entity109 and the incredible flight from slavery to modern days			0
if you look at our society , if you look at the prisons , if you look at the poverty and which side of the line the majority of people are , we have to acknowledge how we divide ourselves up , that there 's racism alive in this country			0
and it 's not in the law			0
it 's in our minds			0
and that 's what we have to actively battle			0
@entity0 : so we 're not bridging the divide ? you think it 's getting worse ? @entity1 : i think we have to be active in teaching our children , and teaching each other			1
we have to be active about kindness and about peace			0
i 've always fantasized that it would be great if there was a @entity139			0
you know , we have a military , but what if there was a department devoted entirely and truthfully to finding peaceful resolutions ? @entity0 : you supported @entity2 in 2008			1
you support him now and played a fundraiser for him in @entity148 this past may			0
are you concerned about his chances in this election ? @entity1 : yeah , i 'm concerned about whether @entity2 can win			1
i 'm also concerned about his policies , you know , because i certainly do n't agree with him on a lot of his positions			1
i think he has a concern for the population that put him in power			0
a real concern for them			0
his environmental position -- although i 'd like to see him push a little harder -- that 's where i 'm drawn to him , and that 's where i agree with him			0
i do n't believe in trickle - down economics			0
i do n't think that people who have the most are inclined to share it , generally			0
but i think it 's going to be a close race , and maybe it 'll be the ugliest election as far as empty falsehoods that the candidates throw at each other			0
when the truth is not really what 's being used to debate things , then it 's hard to see what will come out when it 's just madness			0
i think @entity186 and @entity187 survive on distracting us from the real issues , and so we get very little done when they stay in office			0
and i wish there was a third party , but right now , i will wholeheartedly support @entity2 -- even if i 'm slightly heartbroken about it			1
@entity0 : in 2008 , there were so many entertainers pushing forth his message			0
do you think that support has wavered this time around ? @entity1 : i think he had a sort of single message , and it came from him , and it came from his heart or the hearts of a small group of advisers			1
but then , once he was in office , i think there were a lot more voices that made it harder for him to stay on that message			0
and so i think -- rightly so -- people are disappointed			0
not that it 's been easy , because i think that he 's been up against an incredibly poisonous opposition during his presidency			0
really disrespectful , i think , because he 's still the president			1
but i think i was probably disrespectful of his predecessor			0
but i think it 's reached a new high			0
i 'm disappointed , but i 'd be more disappointed by having a president like @entity224 in there			1
@entity0 : when you talk as an entertainer , people listen			0
will you use that to encourage people to vote ? @entity1 : i think people know what my opinion is			1
i hope that just what i sing about and how i relate to my audience is as much of a political statement as i need to make .			0
