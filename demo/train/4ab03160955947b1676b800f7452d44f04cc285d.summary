-- a 25 - year - old @entity2 man was charged friday with murder in the deaths of two girls who were found about three and a half years ago , shot to death in a ditch alongside a remote country road			1
" we do n't believe that he knew ( the slain girls ) directly , " @entity10 director @entity9 said friday of @entity11			1
" we just believe that he happened to be in the area that day			1
" according to a probable cause affidavit , @entity11 told investigators on september 13 that he 'd been driving his @entity19 where the girls were found when he saw " two monsters " come at him			1
the suspect said he " panicked , " shooting the " monsters " first with a @entity25 handgun and then with a .22 handgun he 'd had in his glove box , the affidavit said			1
it claimed @entity11 had voluntarily waived his rights and agreed to talk to investigators			1
the " monsters " are believed to be best friends @entity34 , 13 , of @entity35 and @entity36 , 11 , of nearby @entity37 , who were discovered june 8 , 2008 , by @entity34 's grandfather			2
they had been shot in the head and chest , eight times for @entity36 and five for @entity34 , the state medical examiner reported after an autopsy			0
their killings rattled @entity35 , a town of just over 1,000 residents , with police calling the shootings the community 's first murders in more than 20 years			2
they also set off an extensive investigation involving multiple local , state and federal law enforcement agencies and including about 650 interviews , 900 leads and 19,000 forensic tests on 800 pieces of evidence , according to @entity62			0
in january 2010 , @entity11 was among those interviewed about the girls ' murder , because he owned a @entity67 handgun like one of those thought to be used in the shootings			2
he then told an investigator then that he 'd sold such a gun in 2007 , according to the arrest affidavit			2
but he was not considered a suspect until this year , after being arrested and charged with the murder of his girlfriend , @entity34 , @entity62 said			1
he was already in the @entity77 in his girlfriend 's death when the new charges were filed , according to the state investigative bureau director			1
he is charged on four counts related to the 2008 case : two each of first - degree murder , plus two each of shooting with intent to kill , according to the affidavit			2
the witnesses cited in this document include several of @entity91 's family members , including his father , as well as the two victims ' relatives and the @entity96 gun company			2
district attorney @entity97 , whose jurisdiction includes @entity100 and @entity101 counties , said friday that he has filed court documents requesting that @entity11 be eligible for the death penalty if found guilty of murder in any of these killings			1
" we feel that we are in an appropriate position to go forward in this case , " @entity97 said friday , referring to the case of the two girls			0
neighbors and relatives described @entity34 and @entity36 as nearly inseparable , often playing together after school , riding their bikes and sleeping at each others ' houses			0
they were at @entity34 's house the night of june 8 , when they set off about 5 p.m. for a walk down the road			0
soon thereafter , @entity34 's grandfather made a futile attempt to call her on her cell phone			0
he found the two girls about 30 minutes later , lying side - by - side in a ditch about a quarter - mile from the home , police said			0
six weeks after the slayings , @entity2 authorities released a 911 tape in which a breathless , nearly hysterical woman -- identified only as a family member of one of the victims -- is heard screaming , " somebody killed two girls			0
" " they went for a walk , and now they are both down here dead			0
... my granddaughter and her friend , " the woman said on the tape			0
please ! " on september 30 , a $ 5,000 reward was offered for information on " the @entity67 model 22 handgun used in the @entity35 girls ' homicides , " the state investigation bureau noted on its website			0
a serial number was given for that weapon , one of two linked to the girls ' deaths			0
ballistics tests determined that the .40 - caliber shell casings found at the crime scene , matched those found on the property of @entity160 , @entity11 's father , the affidavit said			1
investigators determined the serial number of the gun , which had been sold to @entity91			0
in his september interview , the suspect admitted that he 'd purchased the @entity25 gun in 2007			0
authorities on friday reiterated their plea for the public 's help in tracking down this firearm , which they said @entity11 may have tried to sell in march at a @entity174 gun show			1
two photos of the suspect were also released : one taken around the time of the @entity35 killings and the other a mug shot after he was charged in his girlfriend 's death			1
" we hope that , by releasing ( those photos ) , it will spark someone 's memory of seeing mr. @entity11 around the scene of ( @entity34 and @entity36 's ) murder , " @entity62 said .			1

new : @entity193 casings at crime scene matched those on suspect 's father 's land , police say
the suspect says he saw " two monsters " and shot them , according to an affidavit
" we just believe that he happened to be in the area that day , " an investigator says
@entity11 became a suspect in this case after being arrested this *summer* in his girlfriend 's death
