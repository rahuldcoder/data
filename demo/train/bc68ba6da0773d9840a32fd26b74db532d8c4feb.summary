@entity0 -- as a young working mother in the the early 1980s , @entity5 , like many of her generation , struggled to balance work and family			1
the future judge and @entity11 contender had just accepted a job teaching law in @entity13 , @entity14 , while pregnant with her second child			1
soon after @entity17 was born , the professor went into anaphylactic shock and was rushed to the hospital with post-pregnancy complications			2
despite her serious condition , she recovered quickly , but really had no choice			2
friends say that with two young kids and a new job , no maternity leave was offered , and her male colleagues at work were mostly clueless over how to deal with her			2
" people had no idea what to do with the fact that i had these two tiny children , " she told an interviewer last year			0
overcoming institutional and social challenges to become a nationally recognized legal heavyweight and high court contender , colleagues say , is a testament to @entity43 's intellectual and personal fortitude			1
her long , relatively liberal judicial record presents both a measure of certainty about the kind of justice she would become , and a political challenge getting her confirmed			1
" @entity5 is among the most respected federal judges on the left , " said @entity51 , a @entity11 legal analyst and founder of @entity53			1
" being a woman is a political plus , but she has decided cases on abortion , affirmative action , religion , and the like			2
that will generate more of a political firestorm			0
" @entity43 has sat on the 7th @entity64 in @entity13 since 1995			1
considered one of the sharpest minds on that bench , she has known president @entity69 from their days as part - time instructors at the @entity71			2
they have remained casual friends since then			0
she will turn 60 in july and is among the oldest candidates being given serious scrutiny for the high court			0
aware of her liberalism , progressive groups have been quietly urging the @entity78 to nominate @entity43 , saying she also enjoys the support of conservative members of her court , and would be confirmable			1
@entity43 was born in 1950 in @entity82 , and as a teenager moved with her parents to @entity85 , where her father worked as an @entity88 accountant			1
after finishing first in her class at @entity92 's @entity91 , @entity43 had her choice of colleges , including the @entity95 , but chose in - state @entity96 , mainly due to financial considerations			1
she was weeks from beginning graduate studies in literature at @entity100 when , on a whim , she pulled out and decided to take up law at @entity96 , where her future husband was studying			0
if nominated and confirmed to the high court , she would be the only person on that bench without an @entity95 law degree , and the only @entity107			0
she clerked for justice @entity108 in 1976 - 77 , just three years after he issued the landmark @entity110 decision legalizing abortion			1
she was one of only three female @entity11 law clerks that year			0
she later worked as a government lawyer in the administrations of @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
in between were brief stints in private practice and as a law professor at @entity121 and the @entity71 , where she started in 1981 as the only full - time female faculty member			2
she later became associate dean and helped craft the school 's first sexual harassment policy , which took several years to implement			0
" you put your batting helmet on when you go to work for the @entity71 , " @entity43 said last year			1
" it 's a hard - hitting place			2
" the retiring justice @entity130 also attended the school as an undergraduate , and @entity43 still teaches a class in civil procedure on a part - time basis			1
students privately describe her courses as tough but very fair , and say professor @entity43 is a knowledgeable , hands - on teacher and good listener			1
twice divorced with three grown children , @entity43 is now married to a neurologist and lives in a @entity13 suburb			1
judge @entity144 , a conservative member of the @entity145 and a close @entity43 friend , officiated at her 2006 wedding			1
friends describe her as keenly interested in world affairs , and she has traveled the globe extensively promoting @entity153 concepts of the rule of law			0
she has made international trade her legal specialty ; she speaks @entity158 , @entity157 , and some @entity159			1
among her many interests are the oboe and @entity158 horn , and she is good enough to play in several area orchestras			1
@entity43 's judicial record reflects a mainstream liberal jurisprudence , tempered by a respect for precedent and a narrow focus on the facts at hand			1
absent are any detours into ideological rants and asides			0
in her 15 years on the court , she has often served as an intellectual counterweight to leading conservative judges @entity177 and @entity144			0
she has written more than 50 dissents , and concurrences in dozens more			0
she became only the second woman at the time to sit on the @entity145 , recommended to the job by the late sen. @entity183 , @entity14			0
like many of the top contenders being considered by @entity69 , @entity43 has earned a reputation as a consensus - builder on her court			1
her rulings on abortion have attracted the most criticism from conservatives			1
in 2002 , she dissented from a court opinion upholding the constitutionality of an @entity197 statute requiring women to wait 18 hours and receive counseling and additional information before obtaining an abortion ( a woman 's @entity202 , 2002 )			2
in 1999 , she dissented from a ruling upholding the constitutionality of @entity14 and @entity207 statutes banning a late - term procedure opponents call partial - birth abortion ( @entity211 vs. @entity212 , 1999 )			1
the high court a year later affirmed her views , throwing out a similar restriction on the procedure in @entity216			0
in 2001 , @entity43 wrote the opinion upholding a lower court decision that applied anti-racketeering laws against a group of anti-abortion protesters			1
the case was reversed twice by the @entity11 , 8 - 1 and 8 - 0			2
the only dissent by the high court in support of @entity43 's views was @entity130 himself ( @entity228 , 2001 )			1
@entity43 has expressed admiration for her former boss 's views on abortion			1
" @entity241 articulated in @entity110 , " she wrote in a 1993 law review article , " the important insight that a core set of individual rights exists that neither the states nor the federal government may trample			0
" hours after @entity130 announced his retirement in april , abortion opponents made their intentions clear : " a @entity43 nomination would return the abortion wars to the @entity11 , " @entity245 announced in a statement			1
" judge @entity5 would be a very polarizing and divisive nominee , " said @entity249 , chief counsel at the conservative @entity251 network			1
" she 's got cases on abortion , the most extreme abortion cases out there , she 's got some very difficult opinions just to square with the @entity153 people			2
and so she is pretty far out on the left			0
but if that is what the president wants to go for , we are ready for a fight			0
" church - state disputes are another area that may cause difficulty if @entity43 is nominated			1
she ruled against a church that claimed @entity270 's acquisition of church - owned land under eminent domain laws violated the free exercise clause of the @entity275 ( @entity276 vs. @entity277 of @entity13 , 2007 )			1
she argued in a dissent that @entity197 taxpayers had legal standing to challenge the legislative prayer practices in the @entity282 ( @entity283 vs. @entity284 , 2007 )			0
she issued a dissent in favor of allowing a public university to revoke the charter of a @entity290 student organization that refused membership to gays and lesbians ( @entity294 )			0
the high court last month heard a similar case from the same group , over denial of official recognition by a @entity301 law school			0
and in 2008 , she dissented in a ruling allowing a condominium association to prevent a @entity13 family from putting up a @entity306 decoration on their doorpost			1
the @entity308 challenged the rule against placing " objects of any sort " in the hallways			0
mezuzahs are often placed on doors , and contain a small parchment with biblical sayings			0
@entity43 disagreed with the majority 's conclusion the rule was neutral in respect to religion			1
in a long , detailed dissent , she wrote : " the [ condo ] @entity324 might as well hang a sign outside saying ' no observant jews allowed			2
' " she also criticized the condo board for filing an appeal accusing the homeowners of trying to get a " pound of flesh " from the board			0
she noted the phrase comes from @entity336 's " @entity335 , " and refers to the shady actions of @entity338 , a @entity306 moneylender			0
" this is hardly the reference someone should choose who is trying to show that the stand - off ... was not because of the @entity308 ' religion , but rather in spite of it			2
" ( @entity347 v. @entity348 and @entity349 , 2008 )			0
amazingly , because of her powerful dissent , the entire appeals court agreed to rehear the case and reversed unanimously , adopting @entity43 's original position			1
a 2005 law school lecture also raised concerns from conservatives over her views on whether current courts should broadly interpret the original text of the @entity361 , and the rights and privileges it confers on citizens			0
she said of the framers of the 1789 document , " there is no more reason to think that they expected the world to remain static than there is to think that any of us holds a crystal ball , " she wrote			0
" the only way to create a foundational document that could stand the test of time was to build in enough flexibility that later generations would be able to adapt it to their own needs and uses			0
" many conservatives believe judges should adhere to the strict wording of the @entity361 , and not try to read into rights that do not exist , such as , they contend , the " right " to an abortion			2
@entity43 was interviewed by the president last year , a finalist for the high court seat that went to justice @entity393			2
colleagues privately say @entity43 was pleased with the rapport she established in the one - on - one meeting in the @entity398			1
she has given few media interviews over the years , and has been generally reticent about stating her views off the bench			0
when approached by @entity1 last year in @entity0 , where she had gone to meet @entity69 , @entity43 was polite but firm about her chances			2
" i 'm not answering anything on that , " she said , smiling and apologizing she could not say more			0
in an interview last fall with her alumni magazine , @entity43 said , " as a judge you do n't campaign for such things			2
i 'm in the luxurious position of knowing that the people who count know that i am here , and if they are interested , they 'll let me know			0

@entity5 has a long , relatively liberal judicial record
@entity43 has sat on the 7th @entity64 in @entity13 since 1995
rulings on abortion , church - state disputes could result in tough confirmation battle
