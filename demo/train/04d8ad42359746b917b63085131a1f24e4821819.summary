early one eastern @entity1 morning six months ago , @entity0 was sleeping in her hut , dreaming about selling her crops			1
she heard people singing victory songs , thinking it was part of her dream , but gunshots jolted her awake			2
she could see in the light of dawn that the next village was on fire			0
she saw people fleeing toward her village , some being shot as they ran			2
she quickly herded her four children into the tall grass , where others from her village were already hiding			0
they watched their village torched by the singing militia , known as @entity23 , a branch of which is allied to the @entity26 , the latest rebel group to plunge the @entity1 into full - scale war			1
during their first day of hiding , @entity0 sent her eldest son , @entity31 , back to the village to get food from their storehouse			0
he was discovered and shot			0
the militia began to hunt the villagers in the tall grass , again singing victory songs , using hoes and machetes to kill whomever they caught			1
the survivors walked for days to a displaced persons camp , where @entity0 's second son , @entity45 , died of malaria			0
" i ca n't understand how human beings can treat other human beings this way , " @entity0 said			0
this story echoes what so many have suffered through during 16 years of eastern @entity1 's war , the deadliest since @entity54 , nearly 70 years ago , with about 6.9 million deaths , based on a @entity57 estimate in 2010			1
on sunday , the @entity1 and other @entity59 states are due to sign a framework agreement that aims to build a foundation for regional peace			1
that so many @entity59 states -- along with the @entity67 , @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65 -- are uniting in an effort to address the roots of conflict in @entity1 is an encouraging development			1
the signing of this framework deal does n't end the war in @entity1 , but rather it provides a starting point for a global effort to try to end finally the world 's deadliest conflict			1
four important changes are under way in @entity1 today , giving this initiative a better chance than its predecessors			1
first , for decades all of the benefits of eastern @entity1 's vast mineral resource wealth have gone to those with the biggest guns -- the @entity1 army , local militias or neighboring countries			2
these minerals include , among others , gold , cobalt , copper , tin , industrial diamonds and coltan , used in cell phones , laptops and other electronic devices			0
but @entity65 and @entity103 consumer demands for a conflict - free minerals trade , congressional legislation , @entity107 aid suspensions , @entity67 experts ' reports , responsible investors and other influential voices are making it harder to profit violently and illegally from mineral smuggling			1
second , regional support for armed groups inside eastern @entity1 has been a staple of the ongoing cycle of war there for years			1
for the first time , the international community is imposing meaningful consequences for evidence of cross-border weapons supply			0
@entity125 strenuously denies involvement , but some donors have suspended aid programs to that nation and will continue to do so until the evidence shifts toward solutions			0
third , until recently , accountability for war crimes was n't part of the discussion despite some of the worst crimes against humanity being committed globally since @entity54 but calls for international justice have intensified inside @entity1 and beyond , and accused war criminals are beginning to face sanctions			1
fourth , calls for the reform of a @entity67 peacekeeping mission that costs more than $ 1 billion are increasing			0
refocusing the mission on eradicating the worst armed groups , demobilizing rank - and - file combatants and helping to reform @entity1 's army would go much further than the present mandate			1
@entity151 has pledged 4,000 new combat troops to deal with the worst militias , and change can start with them			0
when i asked @entity0 why all this was happening , she replied , " the war is over the minerals , nothing else			2
" although some would say that is oversimplified , it is undeniable that a major tipping point is approaching			0
if the commercial incentives for the massively profitable minerals trade can be shifted from violent , illegal extraction to peaceful , legal development , @entity1 could enjoy a transition similar to those experienced by @entity59 countries plagued by blood diamond wars a decade ago			1
a soon - to - be - named @entity67 " super envoy " should help construct a comprehensive peace process for @entity1 and its neighbors , building on the upcoming framework			1
with his history of concern over @entity1 , @entity65 secretary of state @entity177 could be helpful in this			2
one would involve an impartially facilitated national dialogue to address internal @entity1 issues such as army and justice reform , decentralization , electoral frameworks , immigration , minority protections , land dispute adjudication , mining codes and other divisive issues			2
the other would be a regional process in which @entity1 and its neighbors could address shared security threats and negotiate cooperative investment and infrastructure arrangements that could ignite a real economic boom for @entity151			2
" people around the world should do all they can to stop those instigating war in my country , " @entity0 told me			0
" that is the only way we can be at peace			0
if i hear my village is at peace , i will drop everything and go home with my children			0
" given the history of international looting of @entity1 's resources , we should help give @entity0 -- and @entity1 -- that chance .			2

@entity1 war , *funded* by conflict minerals , is the deadliest since @entity54
in @entity1 , @entity223 heard of villagers *slaughtered* with machetes , families fleeing
he says @entity230 consumer demand for a conflict - free minerals trade is encouraging
he thinks signs are *hopeful* as @entity1 , other @entity59 nations sign framework for peace
