@entity1 scored another major success in the early 1970s with " @entity41 , " a live album and concert film			1

it also won him a @entity51 , and the @entity52 for best original song			2
@entity1 was known for his spasmodic movements on stage , where he often flailed his arms as he sang			1
his distinctive moves , he said , were almost accidental			2
" i never played organ or piano or guitar , so it was more out of frustration and me just trying to impersonate in a way , " @entity1 told the @entity58 in 2012			1
" i did it subconsciously			2
people mistook for me being ill , like i had palsy			2

" if i 'd been stronger mentally , i could have turned away from temptation , " @entity1 said			1
" but there was no rehab back in those days			2
drugs were readily available , and i dived in head first			2
and once you get into that downward spiral , it 's hard to pull out of it			2
it took me years to get straight			2

" it was @entity99 who helped me get myself back together , " he said			0

if you are going to have cabin fever , have a big cabin			0
i walk on a regular basis , i have a couple of dogs			0
the house tucks right into the mountains			0
i literally feel i have become a mountain man over these past couple of years			0
