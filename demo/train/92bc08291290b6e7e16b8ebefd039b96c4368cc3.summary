-- president @entity2 's favorite television shows include " @entity3 " and " @entity4			0
" one can imagine that when his @entity8 counterpart @entity7 wants to kick back and relax , all he will need to do is turn on the nightly news and watch the latest reports from the @entity11 in @entity12			1
@entity7 can listen as @entity11 leaders roll out the latest iteration of their bold responses to his annexation of @entity17 and his invasion of @entity19			1
imagine how he 'll be tickled as @entity11 leaders fall all over themselves trying to find ways to refer to his sending @entity8 troops into a neighboring country without actually calling it an invasion			1
imagine him , no doubt lying shirtless on a polar bear skin that he single - handedly separated from its original owner , laughing as @entity11 unveils the stockpile of strong adjectives that have been its principle weapons in containing the @entity31 's aggression			1
then , as @entity11 's secretary general @entity32 rolls out what they call in the political biz " the big deliverable " of the summit -- a @entity38 that will make 4,000 troops available within two days of a @entity8 incursion into a member state -- one can only hope that @entity31 doctors are standing by , because @entity7 could injure himself laughing			1
first of all , @entity11 members are already supposed to be guaranteed protection by virtue of their very membership			2
one would imagine that each had in mind something considerably more robust and more rapid than this middling unit the alliance has dreamed up			0
this is little more than a tepid response gesture , a sign not of strength , but one that shows how the world 's most powerful alliance is now utterly adrift			0
there will be many speeches suggesting that @entity11 is re-energized by @entity7 's threat			1
there will be lots of self - congratulations on the effectiveness of economic sanctions levied against the @entity8			2
there will be talk of new mega-sanctions that will really keep them in line			0
but @entity7 will sit there watching , perhaps munching on pieces of deep fried @entity75 tiger that he killed with his bare hands , as he contemplates that everything he wanted he got , and that all he wants he can get -- at a low , low price			1
no one even discusses whether @entity7 can keep @entity17 , which he claimed without a shot being fired			2
whether he ultimately annexes @entity19 or simply drives home the message that it has deep ties to @entity8 and that @entity83 will expect to be consulted regarding its fate , he knows he is in the negotiating position of strength			2
he knows for two reasons			0
first , he sees that neither the @entity88 nor its @entity90 allies have much appetite to stand up to him			2
time after time as he tested them -- in @entity94 , in @entity19 , in @entity95 -- they grumbled and then blinked			0
they are too self - absorbed and caught up in domestic problems			2
and frankly , they do n't care that much about @entity94 or @entity19 or @entity95			0
also , he has discovered that @entity11 and the @entity101 are designed to confront extreme threats , not the moderate , incremental , creeping gains he has achieved			1
@entity11 effectively has two settings when it comes to aggression in @entity90 's east : off and global thermonuclear war			1
he has worked the middle ground and the lack of resolve of his opponents with considerable skill			0
he also knows the truth			0
he is merely toying at the periphery of @entity11 and frankly , rhetoric aside , he is no threat to regions deeper into @entity90			1
@entity7 is a distraction with which @entity11 is ill - prepared to deal			1
it faces much greater threats : the spread of @entity125 extremism is destabilizing the world from @entity127 to @entity128			1
although @entity11 is equally ill at ease in confronting that deepening crisis , with extremist foreign fighters passing through or hailing from @entity11 member states , it faces an even bigger crisis from within : a leadership void			2
the @entity135 lacks the will , the culture and the institutional mechanisms to make real unified foreign policy			0
the @entity88 is in a moment of seeming confusion about its role in the world			0
the revitalization of the alliance everyone is calling for is a good idea , urgently needed , but there are few signs it is really on the horizon			0
as a consequence , @entity7 can watch the @entity11 show and enjoy it for what it is : a diversion			1
the rhetoric might get heated			0
some might suggest that he , for all his cool calculation and his so far effective gambits , is the mad man in this scenario			0
but watching the current version of this superannuated , divided , leaderless alliance , he knows that when it comes to standing up to him in @entity19 , @entity11 is the house of cards .			1

@entity164 : @entity7 will be *entertained* watching the @entity11
@entity11 's rhetoric has been its only weapon against @entity8 aggression
@entity11 is not designed to respond to @entity7 's style of incremental *takeovers*
@entity11 , @entity88 absorbed with fighting @entity125 extremism and solving domestic issues
