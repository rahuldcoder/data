-- late to work this morning ? forget those excuses about traffic jams and @entity4 hangovers			0
you might be able to blame your @entity6			1
reports from @entity8 suggest a bug in the @entity6 's alarm app caused it not to adjust to the end of @entity12 in that part of the world			1
consequently , people in @entity8 were tweeting like crazy about waking up an hour late because of the apparent bug			1
" a whole hour of peace and quiet in the office this morning without any @entity6 users courtesy of @entity23 , " wrote a @entity18 user named jamiei			2
. a user named garrettc wrote : " @entity27 , do you remember where you were during the great iphone alarm calamity of 2010 ? " " no son , i was asleep " @entity12 ended on sunday in @entity8 , causing clocks to reset to an hour earlier			1
reports suggest recurring @entity6 alarms did not adjust to the new time			1
the time change does not go into effect until november 7 in the @entity37 and no alarm - clock problems have been reported here			2
earlier in october , websites in @entity40 reported an @entity6 software bug caused alarms to go off an hour earlier than expected			2
the blog @entity44 writes about a way to trick your alarm into going off at the correct time : " deleting and re-adding the alarms will not fix the issue			0
we 've now tested a number of scenarios under @entity54 for ourselves			0
the bug appears when using a repeating alarm for anything other than ' every day			0
' so for example , your alarm will go off an hour late if it 's set for ' weekdays ' or ' weekends ' or every ' monday			1
' the following alarms are not affected by the bug : " an alarm that does n't repeat ( repeat set to ' never ' ) an alarm set to repeat ' every day ' " the blog @entity65 says @entity23 should announce a software fix : " we imagine @entity23 engineers will be working overtime to get this fixed before daylight saving time hits the @entity37 next weekend			0
" @entity23 did not immediately respond to a @entity0 request for comment			0
the glitch highlights what appears to be a trend of people using their phones to wake themselves up in the morning -- instead of using traditional alarm clocks			2
that may not come as a surprise since people seem to use their phones to do almost everything these days -- from browsing the web to planning pregnancy			0
coincidentally , the tech blog @entity86 on sunday posted a list of five of the best ( @entity89 ) alarm clock apps for the @entity6			1
if you 're in the @entity37 , it might be smart to visit that page before sunday .			0
