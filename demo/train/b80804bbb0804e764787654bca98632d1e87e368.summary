-- written on every page of @entity3 's history , in ink and in blood , is the name @entity7			1
his life , which ended today after an eight - year coma , deeply influenced @entity3 's past			1
but even in death , @entity11 will influence the future , as @entity3 consider their options if the two - state solution fails			1
during @entity3 's @entity16 , the handsome blond officer , known as " @entity7 , " was shot and left for dead			1
he recovered and founded @entity3 's first commando unit , which conducted raids beyond @entity3 's borders			2
in the 1956 @entity23 campaign , he led @entity3 's legendary paratroopers into clashes behind enemy lines			1
a successful general in the @entity28 , he achieved world fame six years later by spurring @entity3 troops across the @entity31 to encircle the @entity33 army in the @entity34			1
the image of @entity11 , still blond but now stout , his head wrapped in a bloodied bandage , became iconic			0
his heroism was uniquely @entity3 , built by breaking rules as well as orders , and by surrounding himself with controversy and myth			2
but @entity11 's real legacy was made in politics			0
here , too , he ignored the norms and forged his own often - tortuous path			0
he traversed the political spectrum , from the labor farm in which he grew up to the rightist @entity51 that he established with @entity52			0
as agriculture minister in the late 1970s , he constructed dozens of settlements in the @entity55 and @entity56 , gaining a reputation as an opponent of peace			0
but then , as defense minister , he evicted thousands of @entity3 from settlements in @entity23 to fulfill @entity3 's treaty with @entity33			2
in 1982 , @entity11 masterminded the @entity3 invasion of @entity64 , by some accounts deceiving prime minister begin , and besieged @entity67			2
an @entity3 investigation implicated @entity11 in the massacre of 800 @entity71 civilians by @entity64 militiamen and compelled him to resign			1
i saw the two sides of @entity11 , the bullheaded warrior and man of the people			0
i saw how @entity3 were alternately repelled and captivated by him			2
i was stationed with the @entity3 paratroopers in @entity67 when we learned that @entity11 wanted to visit the troops			1
@entity85 over what they regarded as a reckless war , my buddies indicated that the defense minister was unwelcome			0
but weeks later , while hosting @entity11 at a base inside @entity3 , i watched amazed as he left the table to chat with the cook , about whom he remembered every detail			2
known even in @entity93 as the @entity94 â € ” as much for perseverance as girth â € ” @entity11 in 2000 burst into the political forefront			0
the @entity71 leader @entity98 had rejected @entity3 's offer of independence in all of @entity56 , most of the @entity55 and half of @entity102 , and blamed @entity11 's visit to the @entity104 for igniting the @entity105			1
through the havoc wrought by @entity71 suicide bombers , @entity11 pressed into the prime minister 's office with @entity110 's @entity109 as his deputy			2
the once - impetuous soldier became the prudent statesman as @entity11 waited through months of bombings before finally striking back			0
in april 2002 , he ordered @entity3 forces to eradicate terror and restore peace to @entity3 neighborhoods			1
then @entity11 , with characteristic audacity , pivoted toward peace			0
but failing to reach an agreement with the @entity71 , he decided to act unilaterally			2
the former champion of the settlements now proposed " disengagement " -- to uproot them , along with @entity3 forces , from @entity56			2
this divided the @entity3 public and drove @entity11 to create his own party , which gained wide support			1
in 2005 , the residents of all 21 @entity56 settlements were evacuated			0
@entity132 subsequently took over @entity56 and fired thousands of rockets at @entity3			0
still , an unapologetic @entity11 was about to apply his unilateralist strategy to the @entity55 when he suffered a massive stroke			0
today , as @entity139 secretary of state @entity138 pursues a peace agreement between @entity3 and the @entity71 , @entity11 's approach is once again being discussed			1
a growing number @entity3 are asking , " what happens if the process fails ? " one solution could be a unilateral @entity3 withdrawal from @entity71 population centers in the @entity55			1
as in the disengagement from @entity56 , the @entity139 would endorse this move , but unlike in @entity56 , most @entity3 settlements would remain within @entity3 , and @entity3 troops would still patrol strategic borders			1
of course , the preferable solution is two states for two peoples			0
but if that proves unattainable , then @entity3 can still end the occupation of the @entity71 , preserve its security , and perhaps lay new foundations for peace			1
even when comatose , @entity7 was a constant presence for @entity3			1
whether as the dashing commando , the farmer , the builder , the contrarian , and belated seeker of peace , he reflected them and embodied their story			0
and after his death , his brazen @entity3 way of action lives on			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			0

@entity173 : @entity7 , who died today , had pivotal , enduring effect on @entity3
he says as an @entity3 warrior , he led troops in @entity28 , @entity34 , gained fame
he says in political *career* , he opposed peace , eventually pivoting toward it
@entity173 : two state solution best , but @entity3 can still end the occupation of @entity71
