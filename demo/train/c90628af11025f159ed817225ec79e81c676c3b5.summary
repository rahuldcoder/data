-- @entity1 is a photojournalist who works in the " murder capital of the world " -- @entity4 , @entity5			1
he takes pictures of bodies and survivors , migrants and countrymen , violence and vigils			2
the 51 - year - old photographer puts his life on the line for such photography because he wants the world to know of a patch of earth that many @entity21 journalists -- even those in @entity5 , too -- fear to tread and often avoid			1
that 's because the violence by @entity5 cartels and other criminals who control swaths of the borderlands have secured a reputation for ferocious violence and carnage , including to those who dare to chronicle the death toll			1
to capture the human suffering and endurance , often in the powerful imagery of black - and - white photographs , @entity1 does n't venture out alone anymore			1
he partners with other photographers -- who had been competitors under less dark times -- because they believe there 's greater safety in numbers			0
" when you work as a local journalist , it 's more frequent that you ( are ) facing more risks , " he said in an interview at @entity47 , @entity48 , where he spoke to students about cartel violence and where his photos are on display this month			1
@entity1 has observed how the @entity5 side of the border has been a landscape of change , beginning with the @entity61 in the early 1990s to the massive movement of @entity5 to the @entity21 and elsewhere			1
many parts of @entity4 are now a " ghost town , " he says			1
last year , @entity4 recorded 1,933 violent deaths , according to the @entity67 state attorney 's office			1
that figure is considered exorbitant , especially when compared with the 209 homicides in @entity70 last year , even though that @entity21 city 's population is six times greater than @entity4 's			1
even so , that figure represented a 38 % decline in violent deaths from the year before , when the city counted 3,117 killings			2
the number of violent deaths was 2,643 in 2009 and 1,607 in 2008			0
a mere 300 killings were reported in 2007			0
@entity4 also is known for its high " femicide " rate , the unsolved murders of hundreds of girls and women			2
" during my childhood , @entity4 was a very calm place , very secure place , " @entity1 told @entity0			1
" it 's changed to be very insecure and has become for four years the most violent city on the earth , " he added			0
" you are covering one massacre as another massacre is happening in another district of the city , " @entity1 said			2
" we have disappearances of women , we have disappearances of men , we have execution of women , execution of men , bodies of women left in the desert			0
people who do n't pay extortion are assassinated			0
people who are kidnapped are assassinated , also			0
people who refuse to give their cars are killed , also			0
it is a wide spectrum of where you can be killed in @entity4			2
" according to some of my colleagues , " he continued , " 90 % of the cases are never investigated			0
that can give you the idea of the role of the state and this terrible situation			0
" before @entity4 became synonymous with homicide , the city used to be a party town , with a robust nightlife			1
but a @entity129 study shows that the bloodshed since the early 1990s has displaced 250,000 people , @entity1 said			2
" in many places it looks like a ghost town , a ghost district , " he said			1
@entity1 dares to enter these haunted places -- as well as populated neighborhoods			2
" most of the time the people i meet are going into turning points of their lives			0
it 's very often i 'm a witness to these changes in their lives , " he said			0
" under these circumstances , it is incredible how people are still open to talk to a journalist and tell their stories , and how their communities have been devastated by the economy , and how they can not sustain their lives and families ' educations -- they have to migrate to the @entity21 -- and also how people struggle to survive and make a living in the @entity21 doing very dangerous jobs			0
" @entity1 lives in @entity4 , but his parents and siblings live across the border in @entity159 , @entity160 , and do n't visit him because of the violence , he said			1
@entity0 's @entity162 contributed to this report .			0

@entity1 , 51 , visits @entity165 to display his photos of @entity4 , @entity5
@entity4 is called " the murder capital of the world "
the 51 - year - old photographer does n't venture out alone any more because of the violence
cartel carnage has turned parts of his one - time " calm " *hometown* into a " ghost town , " he says
