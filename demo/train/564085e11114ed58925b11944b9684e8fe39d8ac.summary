-- @entity1 and @entity2 are packed and ready to go			2
they looked over their 50 - item checklist no fewer than a dozen times			2
after planning for this journey to celebrate their 25th wedding anniversary for the better part of three years , they want to be prepared			1
it is , after all , the trip of a lifetime			2
on sunday , the retired couple from @entity15 , @entity16 , will set sail from @entity18 , @entity19 , along with more than 1,300 other passengers on a cruise to mark the 100th anniversary of the sinking of the @entity24			1
" i think it will be fascinating			2
i get chills just thinking about it , " @entity2 says			2
perhaps that 's with good reason			0
the @entity30 will follow the route the @entity24 took , and is scheduled to be in the exact spot at the exact time the @entity24 struck an iceberg close to midnight on april 14 , 1912 , sending it to the bottom of the @entity35 a little less than three hours later			1
more than 1,500 people lost their lives , and about 700 -- mostly women and children -- survived			0
for titanic enthusiasts like the @entity41 , marking the tragedy where it happened is part of the appeal			1
" there is a little bit of excitement and a little bit of trepidation to be on the ship outside at night with the chaplain conducting a @entity55 ceremony to honor the deceased that came from all walks of life , " @entity46 says			1
" to be out there and know that 100 years ago , they were not doing what we will be doing ; that they were wondering how much longer they had left to live ... it 's overwhelming actually			1
" while not everyone would go to these lengths to mark a historic disaster , it 's human nature to be interested			1
" some people may say the curiosity is ghoulish and macabre , but this is really just an ordinary reaction to extraordinary events , " says @entity72 , a psychology professor and director of the @entity74 at the @entity75			0
" it 's a fairly universal interest that human beings have to try to see someone going through what we might experience ourselves , " @entity72 says			1
it 's why people slow down when they drive past an accident , he adds			0
but it is n't just the tragic nature of the @entity24 that captivates the @entity41			1
the mystique of a lost era also fascinates them			0
the cruise , organized by a @entity94 travel agency and sailing on the liner @entity97 , will feature history lectures ; a stop at @entity100 , @entity101 , the @entity24 's last port of call ; and a stop in @entity105 , @entity106 , where many of the victims were buried			1
" the dining rooms are going to follow the etiquette that was used during the @entity110			0
and on the night of the 14th a lot of people will be in period costumes , " @entity2 says			0
" the people on the ship represented a lifestyle that disappeared when the ship sank , " @entity46 says			1
" it was the end of the @entity110 -- the edwardian period where the rich people got off the ship , mostly , and the third class of people mostly perished			1
" @entity2 has been interested in the @entity24 since she was a child			0
and she 's far from the only one			0
the facts surrounding the ill - fated maiden voyage permeate popular culture			0
the disaster has spawned countless books , television specials and movies -- perhaps none more famous than @entity136 's @entity135 - winning film " titanic , " one of the highest - grossing movies of all time			1
to coincide with the anniversary the epic film is being re-released in @entity142 in theaters on friday			1
in @entity145 , @entity101 , where the @entity147 's most infamous ship was built , a new museum opened last month complete with interactive , hands - on exhibits , adding to a growing list of museums dedicated to the disaster , including one in @entity18 , the point from which the ship set sail			1
and there are sister @entity24 attractions in @entity158 , @entity159 , and @entity160 , @entity161 , catering to the fascination of @entity164 audiences			1
what is it that makes the @entity24 so intriguing and universal to so many people ? " i think it 's the fact that it was called unsinkable ; that no one thought this was going to happen			0
a lot of the people on the boat still did n't think it was going to happen when they were sitting in a lifeboat waiting to be rescued , " @entity2 says			0
heavy publicity as the ship was built helped cement the mythology			2
" there was tremendous wealth and glamor on this ' unsinkable ' ship , " he says			2
" but you do n't have to win the lottery to be happy , and you do n't escape terrible things in life just because you are wealthy , and that 's characterized in the fascination of the @entity24			2
" the @entity41 know some people think they 're crazy for what could be looked at as tempting fate			0
" when you say you are going on a cruise , the first thing people ask is ' where ' ? and then i go , ' oh dear , here we go again , ' " @entity2 says			2
" a lot of them say ' our prayers will be with you , ' or ' have a good time			0
' but not too many of them say they would do it			0
" the thought of disaster is there , @entity46 says , but it 's not dampening the couple 's enthusiasm			1
" it 's one last look at my 50 - item checklist that i 've looked at for weeks and weeks and weeks , " he says smiling			0
" it 's all organized			0
it 's time to go			0
" @entity0 's @entity218 sets sail april 10 from @entity219 on a sister titanic anniversary cruise			1
check back next week for his account of the sailing .			0
