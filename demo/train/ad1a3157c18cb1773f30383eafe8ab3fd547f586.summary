@entity0 -- we are all @entity3 17			0
the callous , brutal shooting down of an airplane carrying 298 human beings could have happened to almost any other aircraft , carrying any other people , from anywhere in the world			0
indeed , in @entity0 , reports suggest that two @entity13 flights were nearby when @entity14 crashed ; one of them , @entity17 , was carrying prime minister @entity18 from @entity19 back to the @entity21 capital			2
@entity21 officials have been quick to offer their condolences to the families of the deceased			0
as a growing number of world leaders accuse @entity27 of creating frankenstein 's monster , of giving @entity31 's @entity30 rebels the heavy artillery that brought down @entity33 , @entity0 is so far remaining on the fence			1
in its ugliest hour , facing the likelihood of unprecedented sanctions , authoritarian @entity35 can count on at least one powerful ally : @entity21 , the world 's largest democracy			1
@entity35 and @entity21 , bedfellows ? sound surprising ? it should n't			1
just last week , before the @entity33 disaster , at a @entity44 summit in @entity45 , @entity18 expressed his country 's deep affection for @entity35			1
" even a child in @entity21 , if asked to say who is @entity21 's best friend , will reply it is @entity35 , " declared the @entity21 prime minister			1
or consider how , at a speech in @entity27 last year , then - prime minister @entity54 said these words : " @entity35 has stood by @entity21 at moments of great international challenge , when our own resources were limited and our friends were few			1
... @entity21 will never forget			0
" both @entity18 and @entity54 were pointing to decades of steady relations , starting with @entity21 's independence in 1947 and its brush with socialism in the 1950s , through the @entity65 years and the breakup of the @entity67 , up to the present moment , with the two nations in the middle of joint naval drills in the @entity71			2
the special friendship has disappointed a number of @entity21 's other allies			1
@entity75 has been frustrated by @entity0 's silence on @entity35 's annexation of @entity78			2
@entity31 is even more upset			0
in an interview with the newspaper @entity79 , @entity31 's ambassador to @entity0 said it especially behooved @entity21 to " make a more clear statement on supporting @entity31 's sovereignty and territorial integrity , " given its aspirations to be a @entity87 member			2
on paper , it would seem that @entity21 and @entity35 are unlikely partners			1
they share little by way of history or culture , are run on completely different ideals of government and have opposing economic and demographic trajectories			0
according to a recent @entity98 survey , 45 % of @entity21 have a " favorable " view of @entity35			1
meanwhile , 56 % of @entity21 view the @entity100 favorably			0
surely the @entity100 -- the world 's second largest democracy -- would be a better official " best friend " for @entity21 ? if only			1
as @entity21 commentator @entity108 put it in an essay last year , " the @entity100 are known to be fast in finding new friends when it suits their national interest and faster in dumping them for the same reasons			0
" @entity35 has been a more reliable ally , according to @entity108			0
it has long been @entity21 's biggest source of arms and , unlike the @entity100 , has largely avoided doing business with @entity21 's perennial enemy @entity116			2
opinion : @entity119 's big blunder but if @entity35 becomes more and more isolated , how long would @entity21 stay loyal ? at what point would considerations of trade , arms and energy give way to a vision of what @entity21 stands for ? in the coming weeks and months , @entity21 's government -- a fresh set of leaders with a rare , sweeping mandate for change -- will begin to formulate its foreign policy			1
it will need to redefine @entity21 's place in the world			2
put simply , you ca n't be everyone 's friend			0
the collective opinion and moral stance of the world 's largest democracy matters			1
it is easy to say nice things about relations with @entity146 , the @entity100 , @entity45 and the @entity147 , as @entity0 has done so adeptly in the last few weeks			0
it is much tougher to manage unpopular friendships .			0

@entity21 has a long history of friendship with @entity35
@entity154 : @entity33 disaster tests the alliance , raises questions
he asks , will world 's largest democracy continue to side with authoritarian @entity35 ?
