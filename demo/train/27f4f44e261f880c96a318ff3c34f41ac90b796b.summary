@entity0 -- @entity3 presidential candidate @entity2 is a multimillionaire who wanted elevators for his luxury cars and whose wife wears $ 1,000 designer t - shirts			1
@entity8 , even before being elected president , was an academic intellectual who made millions writing books and then became a professorial media darling who hobnobbed with @entity14 celebrities and @entity16 investment bankers			1
yet each candidate accuses the other of being out of touch , unable to connect with everyday people			2
just look at their gaffes last week over the ailing economy			1
@entity2 called @entity8 " out of touch " on friday after the president declared the " private sector is doing just fine			1
" the @entity8 campaign hit back in a video accusing @entity2 of being insensitive to the middle class because " he wants to cut jobs for firefighters , police and teachers			1
" @entity8 : they still like him , but will they vote for him ? both candidates are virtually tied in national horse - race polls , although @entity8 enjoys a sizable lead when it comes to " likabilty " among voters			1
every quarter , they are outraising each other with millions of dollars in campaign contributions from big money and small donors alike			0
their core supporters are passionate , although somewhat restrained early in the campaign			0
still , there is a perceived distance between them and many voters			2
@entity8 ca n't shake the " elite professor " label , while @entity2 is seen as a rich guy 's " rich guy			1
" but if previous presidential candidates are any indication , @entity56 rarely elects " everyday " folks into office			1
in modern times , the voters tend to elect wealthy politicos -- often those who hail from political dynasties			1
the electorate seems to want a mix of personality and power , but only if they come with a pedigree and bank account to match			0
" there is n't any connection between connecting with an average voter and being an average voter , " said @entity73 , a @entity1 contributor and history and public affairs professor at @entity77 who has written books on former presidents @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82			1
take @entity80 , for example			0
he was a wealthy businessman and former @entity89 governor whose father , @entity90 , was the nation 's 41st president			1
the younger @entity80 owned a baseball team , grew up around big oil and was said to have a net worth of more than $ 25 million			0
yet routinely he topped informal " which candidate would you like to have a beer with ? " polls and was generally deemed an affable " guy 's guy			0
" @entity81 was a popular actor - turned - governor who made his money as a spokesman for @entity103			2
@entity82 was a rich peanut farmer - turned - governor			0
@entity105 was heir to a wealthy and powerful political leadership legacy			2
" there 's something instinctive that many voters think if you lived in the same circumstances as most @entity56 you can understand them , " @entity73 said			1
" it 's a conventional wisdom that does n't mesh with presidential history			2
" there have been some modern presidents who come from humbler beginnings			2
both @entity117 and @entity8 were raised by parents who struggled to make ends meet			1
@entity120 and @entity121 also hailed from working - class roots			0
@entity123 : are politicians too rich to understand us ? neither @entity2 nor @entity8 could be considered " everyday people " by most measures			1
while the median @entity56 household income is about $ 50,000 a year , only a few regular voters are worth more than $ 250 million such as @entity2 or have best - selling books and a personal wealth of up to $ 8.3 million such as @entity8			1
family net worth plummets nearly 40 % still much ado has been made in this campaign cycle about @entity2 's disconnect with voters			1
his gaffes in name - dropping his @entity139 - owning friends and comments about owning more than one @entity141 may rub some voters the wrong way			2
for @entity2 , a lot of that may have less to do with his wealth than the perception of his stiff demeanor , said @entity149 , a senior editor with the @entity150			1
" i do n't think @entity2 is ever going to be seen as an average guy , " @entity149 said			1
" contrast him with @entity80			0
in some ways they had similar backgrounds , but @entity80 was a regular guy			0
you just saw him as a very regular guy			0
@entity2 , when he talks about @entity139 , he 's talking about his friends owning			2
you do n't see @entity80 talking about ' when i owned the @entity159			0
' " @entity8 's had his share of awkward moments as well			2
the celebrity - themed fund - raisers with @entity164 and " @entity168 " star @entity165 -- who cheekily referred to the president as " that guy " -- have struck some critics as opulent and overly elite			2
the @entity170 poked fun at the president 's chummy relationships with @entity14 types in an ad called " @entity176			0
" the ad says , " @entity56 elected the biggest celebrity in the world , " then proceeds to slam the president 's performance on the economic and jobs front			1
" after four years of a celebrity president , is your life any better ? " the ad asks in conclusion			0
the president has a 56 % favorability rating , compared with @entity2 at 48 % , according to a recent @entity1 / @entity191 poll			1
political experts said that in this era of celebrity worship and obsession with reality television stars , the ability to connect on some sort of personal level with everyday voters takes on heightened importance			0
" part of it is that there seems to be such gridlock ( voters are ) skeptical that ( politicians ) are going to do anything so they look at the ' who can i have a beer with ? ' factor , " @entity73 said			0
@entity117 hailed from humble beginnings to become governor of @entity215 and eventually president but then was impeached on perjury and obstruction of justice charges before his @entity220 acquittal			0
according to a recent @entity1 / @entity191 poll , years after he left office , @entity117 still enjoys a 66 % approval rating			0
but the cult of personality and connecting with everyday voters will only carry a candidate so far			0
" even though it 's an age of slickly packaged ads and messaging , people are transparent , " @entity73 said			0
" you ca n't force people to make them like you			0

president @entity8 , @entity2 both made recent gaffes about the economy
wealth , personalities may make them appear out of touch with average voters
history shows @entity56 rarely elect presidents who are not wealthy
