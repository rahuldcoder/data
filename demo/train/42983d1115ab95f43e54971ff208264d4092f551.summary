-- to hear leaders of the " draft @entity2 for @entity4 ! " @entity6 group tell it , this is a story about " insider " politicians , " street - level voters " and whether a likeable rock star with strong grass - roots appeal will run for the @entity4			1
the " movement , " as the group calls it , was born less than three weeks ago with @entity16 sen. @entity15 's stunning announcement he would not not run for re-election			1
the next morning , @entity19 , 21 , was at home watching cable news reports about a @entity6 page aimed at bringing @entity2 , 58 , into the race			1
" after i saw that i went right to the @entity6 group , " @entity19 said wednesday from his home in @entity26			0
" by then it had only been a matter of hours and it had already gotten a thousand members			0
it was incredibly exciting to see that catching hold			0
" he contacted the group 's founder and from then on he was hooked			2
so far , the group has garnered more than 7,000 members in 16 days			1
" there 's all this faux populism out there -- people who get paid millions of dollars to generate campaigns that look like they 're supporting the people , " said @entity19 , a self - described community ambassador for a local @entity36 tv station			0
" when you have the prospect of somebody as genuine as @entity2 campaigning as someone people can relate to , it 's unique , it 's something you ca n't replace			1
" but there 's another turn in this twisted tale			0
because @entity15 waited until february 15 to announce his decision , he essentially forced the party to choose its candidate instead of leaving it up to voters in the state 's may 4 primary			0
according to party rules , @entity16 's 32 - member @entity61 will vote by secret ballot to decide who will run			1
the committee chairman said members wo n't consider anyone who has n't officially declared themselves a candidate			2
" i do n't think [ @entity2 's ] going to declare , " said chairman @entity71			1
for his part , @entity2 continues to issue nothing but a terse " no comment , " through a spokesman			2
the idea that @entity16 @entity77 would not hold a primary to choose their @entity4 candidate felt like a " punch in the face " said @entity19			1
" " i do n't think that the decisions of insiders are necessarily reflective of the popular political will , " he said			0
through @entity87 , @entity19 is organizing the first of a statewide series of planned rallies set for friday at a 1950s - era hangout on @entity26 ' folksy @entity92			2
at @entity93 , home of the " @entity95 " and 99 - cent root beer floats , @entity19 hopes to attract a dozen @entity2 supporters , whom he 'll ask to sign a petition to be submitted to @entity16 newspaper editors			1
in the coming days , @entity19 plans a much larger rally in the @entity61 stronghold of @entity103 -- right in the small - town rocker 's own backyard			1
the fact that his @entity6 campaign comes during an election cycle influenced by a larger , grass - roots @entity111 movement -- with polar opposite political views -- is n't lost on the @entity6 page founder @entity114			1
" the end result of moving out the status quo in favor of new faces is probably the same goal , " he said with a laugh			0
the @entity122 campaign is racing against a deadline			0
the state 's @entity61 committee will hold its vote as early as may 15 , and any candidate , including @entity2 , must officially declare 72 hours prior , according to @entity71 -- that would be noon may 12			1
as for @entity2 himself , he 's " never expressed overt interest in running for anything , " said the musician 's longtime publicist , @entity129 , by phone from his @entity133 office			1
much has been written in the past few weeks about @entity2 's 2008 campaign performances for presidential candidates @entity138 and @entity140 , as well as his years of public support for family farmers and his opposition to the @entity145 war			1
" i do n't think it 's a crazy idea , " @entity129 said about the draft campaign			1
" i mean that from the point of view of someone who knows him and knows his intellect and knows that he is an aware person			0
but he 's not a very politicked person -- meaning he is not prone to pull his punches			0
" opinion : senator @entity2 ? crazy talk pundits and party officials say they 're stymied by this question : instead of , " no comment , " why does n't @entity2 just say , " no thank you ? " why does n't he declare that he 's just not interested to reduce political confusion and streamline the nomination process ? " i 've said something along the same lines , " said @entity129			1
@entity168 political columnist @entity167 , who has been covering @entity170 politics since 1992 , offered his theory : " why not just allow the buzz to go out there ? he 's a businessman , like a politician he knows it does n't hurt him to have people talking about it			2
so it is kind of interesting that he has n't officially said anything either way			0
my guess is he 's just enjoying the moment			0
" however unlikely , a @entity2 campaign could be formidable , said pundits , despite @entity16 's strong @entity186 establishment			1
" a lot of @entity190 think that he speaks for them , " said @entity187 of the daily online brief @entity188			0
" he 's pretty well tapped into the @entity16 soul			2
" in the short time since @entity15 's announcement , two @entity77 who were considering running have decided not to			0
most of the @entity61 establishment , said @entity167 , has coalesced strongly around moderate rep. @entity199 , a former county sheriff			2
" i was with a friend of @entity2 's in @entity103 last week , " said @entity187			1
" his comment was , ' there 's no way @entity204 could last in the @entity4			2
it would be absolutely stifling for him			0
he would n't be able to say exactly what 's on his mind			2
' " " it 's one thing to be [ @entity211 comedian and @entity213 sen. ] @entity214 , @entity216 grad , who has some seriousness about him -- not that @entity2 does n't -- i 'm just not sure the @entity4 's an appropriate forum for him			1
" apparently , the @entity4 was becoming unpalatable for @entity15 , who announced he was leaving because an overly partisan " @entity221 is not operating as it should			0
" " the people 's business is not getting done , " he said			0
@entity114 , the @entity6 page founder , blames political " insiders " for congressional gridlock and " all the obstruction to progress we 're having right now			0
" he sees the internet as a way to break what he called an insiders ' stranglehold on the nomination process			0
" we need someone like @entity2 , who 's much more tuned to street - level voters			2
