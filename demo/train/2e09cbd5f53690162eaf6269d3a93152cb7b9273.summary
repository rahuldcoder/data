@entity0 , @entity1 -- december 13 , 1996			2
my son , barely a few moments old , is crying			0
i walk toward the medical room bassinette where he is lying , smile , and then tell him not to worry ... daddy 's here			0
and then ever so gently i place his tiny hand inside mine and again tell him daddy 's here ... i will keep you safe			1
and thus began a parent and child relationship that is probably no different than the billions that came before that night and the billions in the 16 years after			1
of all the natural instincts that enslave my body , the desire to love and protect my son is a master i have never rebelled against			1
and i am sure many of you can agree : being a parent can be both a person 's greatest joy and greatest sense of anxiety			1
" i will keep you safe , " is what we tell them			2
and then something like the shooting at @entity35 happens , or the shooting at the mall in @entity38 , or the movie theater in @entity40 , and you are reminded of how increasingly difficult it is to do just that			2
there have been 31 school shootings since @entity46 in 1999 , and sadly there is not a damn thing to suggest there wo n't be 31 more			2
in my 20 years of journalism , i have had quite a few conversations with mourning mothers and fathers who have had to bury their children			2
last year i interviewed a father who dropped his son off at football practice and never saw him alive again -- taken by an undiagnosed heart ailment			0
i cried for hours afterward			0
i 'm sure that father still cries on occasion today			0
but something different grips your soul when you know the cause of a child 's premature death was not brought on by ill health or an accident , but rather an outbreak of senseless violence that took place somewhere we once viewed as safe -- like an elementary school			1
or as we saw late this summer in @entity75 , a place of worship			0
we hurt and weep for the victims while fighting off a chilling fear that the same thing can happen to us			2
i can take my son to the doctor to have his heart checked out , but how do i or any of us drop our children off at school on monday and not be worried ? scared ? some of us who choose to live in small cities or nice neighborhoods used to be able to cloak ourselves with the comfort of " it ca n't happen here			1
" but in this new @entity91 , it can			0
@entity93 , @entity94 , is far from the mean streets of @entity96			0
there are fewer than 28,000 people there			0
what are parents supposed to do ? " i will keep you safe " is so much harder today , and at times i feel as if i 'm running out of places to hide			1
do i keep him away from the movie theater ? the mall ? school ? tragedies like these usually reignite discussions surrounding gun laws , but those talks and possible changes do nothing to ease the fear millions of parents are dealing with right now			1
guns are the symptoms , the true disease is a culture that embraces , glorifies , and monetizes violence			0
in the summer of 2011 , a man drove through the heart of my mid-size city 's downtown and randomly sprayed the streets with bullets -- striking innocent bystanders before speeding down the street and eventually killing himself			0
what am i supposed to do , not let my son go to the library that 's down there ? " i will keep you safe " is my promise to him , and there are days in which i feel as if this new @entity91 is determined to make keeping that promise as hard as possible			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity146 .			1

@entity146 : the promise a parent makes to a child is " i will keep you safe "
he says mass murders spread fear that parents ca n't protect their children
@entity146 : small towns , movie theaters , schools , malls have become *vulnerable* places
