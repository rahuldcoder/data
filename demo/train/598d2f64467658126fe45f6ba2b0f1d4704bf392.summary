-- when @entity4 's daughters were younger , her diaper bag was filled with coloring books , crayons , storybooks and little games in case one of them became restless			1
now that @entity4 's kids are 4 and 7 , the diaper bag is gone , but the need for entertainment -- especially in restaurants -- is not , which is why two - thirds of the apps on @entity4 's @entity17 are for her children			1
" people have always brought toys , or something to entertain their child , into restaurants and stores , " says the mom , who lives in @entity20 , @entity21			0
" now we just have better technology			0
" @entity30 parents for years have relied on glowing electronic screens -- tvs , video games , computers -- to entertain children in the home			1
now more and more parents are discovering smartphones ' similar ability to engage squirmy kids at restaurants , in the car and anywhere else where youngsters grow bored			1
almost half of the top 100 - selling education apps in the @entity47 were for preschool or elementary - aged children in november 2009 , according to a content analysis by the @entity51 , which promotes digital media technologies to advance children 's learning			1
expert @entity56 says the reason for this -- assuming the majority of 3 - to 10 - year - olds do n't own their own phones -- is because adults are taking advantage of the smartphone 's ability to act as a mobile learning or entertainment device for their children			1
@entity56 , a fellow at the @entity69 ( part of the @entity71 ) calls this phenomenon the " pass - back " effect -- as in parents passing their phones back to their bored kids			1
shortly after the @entity17 came out , @entity56 said she noticed children as young as 3 years old playing with the shiny devices			1
" i saw it on the subway , at the grocery store -- anywhere you 'd see a parent and child interacting , really , " she said			2
even @entity87 acknowledged this trend in the current commercial where @entity90 " passes back " a smartphone to a crying child in a restaurant , @entity56 said			2
app developers have noticed and are creating kids ' games for phones , even though they do n't think toddlers are buying smartphones , she said			1
almost all children in the @entity101 have access to a mobile device , according to the @entity71			2
a 2007 study found that 93 percent of 6 to 9 - year - olds had access to a cell phone in the home and more than 30 percent owned their own phone			2
@entity56 said these number have only increased since the study was conducted			0
so how do such young children come to understand this new touchscreen technology ? " a child is not as afraid that they 're going to break something or do something wrong [ as adults are ] , " @entity56 said			1
" they 're more likely to pick [ the phone ] up and just play with it , which is the best way to learn			0
" @entity121 is one of the apps @entity4 downloaded for her 4 - year - old daughter , @entity123			1
@entity4 said the educational app , which asks @entity123 to pick out certain shapes , is a fun learning tool the pair can play together			1
but @entity4 says even the less educational apps on her @entity17 , such as @entity129 , @entity130 and 7 - year - old @entity132 's favorite , @entity133 , are teaching her kids hand - eye coordination and to be comfortable with technology			1
" i do n't use [ the @entity17 ] to parent my child , " she said			1
" i use it to entertain them ... if they 're on it an hour a week , that 's a lot			0
when we 're sitting at home , they 're not playing on my phone			0
it 's just something that they do when we 're out			0
" @entity4 acknowledges that some people think letting young children play with your phone is a bad thing			0
but those are usually the same people who complain about children running around a restaurant kicking and screaming , she said			0
the app market for kids has continued to grow at a rapid rate since the @entity162 analysis was published six months ago , said @entity56			0
@entity56 said her research has found that children 's educational apps tend to cost less than apps for older children or adults			1
but the kids ' games and other apps are only one reason @entity17 and other smartphones are a hit with children , she said			1
" when you look at the design of the @entity17 ... the interface is very tactile and well suited to what a child naturally does , " @entity56 said			1
" they think with their fingers			0
if they see something they like , they 'll jab at it and touch it			0
and children love flipping things			0
if you flip the @entity17 , something will happen			2
if you shake the @entity17 , something will happen			2
" take a look at some of the best - selling toys throughout the years , she said			1
kids have always loved to play with toy telephones , toy lawn mowers , toy ovens and toy vacuum cleaners			0
" they like to play with things their parents have , " she said			0
" considering how much time parents spend on [ their phones ] , it makes sense that kids would want them , too			2
" and it 's not just smartphones -- kids enjoy playing and learning on any mobile electronic gadget , @entity56 said			1
" take pictures with your kids , " she said			0
" or pull out the calculator and ask your kid to help add up what the groceries are going to cost			0
these are really powerful devices			0
" @entity220 of @entity221 , @entity21 , says her 1 year old entertains himself just by holding on to her cell phone , which is not a smartphone			0
@entity220 's 2 - year - old daughter , on the other hand , already prefers a touchscreen device			2
@entity220 said her older daughter enjoys playing educational flashcard games and listening to music on her mother - in - law 's @entity17			1
she likes to slide the pictures around , she added			0
" i 'd love an @entity17 , " @entity220 said			2
but , for now , " it 's just another one of those things [ the kids ] get to do at grandma 's house			2

more parents are handing their smartphones to their kids to keep them entertained
@entity244 ' designs -- touch screens and bright colors -- attract children
