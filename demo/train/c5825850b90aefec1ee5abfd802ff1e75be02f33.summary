@entity0 bemoaned the " worst season of my career " after seeing his @entity2 side slip to a 2 - 1 extra time defeat to capital rivals @entity4 in the final of the @entity6			1
@entity0 , who is widely tipped to return to take charge of @entity11 @entity10 , made his feelings clear to the media after seeing his last chance of silverware this season slip away			1
in the last few weeks , @entity2 have lost in the semifinals of the @entity17 to @entity18 and seen arch - rivals @entity19 clinch the @entity22 title			1
a season which started with such promise after beating @entity19 to win the @entity25 has petered out and left the " @entity26 " frustrated			0
" this is the worst season of my career with a title that is not sufficient to satisfy @entity2 and therefore it is a bad season			1
" with a final , a semifinal , second place in the league and the @entity33 , what for many would be a good season , for me is the worst			2
" pressed on his likely move to @entity10 , @entity0 refused to be drawn			2
" i have a contract for three more years and i have still not sat down with the president to talk about my future , " he said			0
" i have to be honest			0
until the day that the president sits down with me and the club does something official it has to be like this			0
" if the match in the @entity46 friday night is to prove @entity0 's swansong at @entity2 , it did n't go as planned			1
it was n't the best of nights for his talisman @entity51 , either , as he saw red in the dying minutes			2
@entity0 was ordered to leave the touchline by the referee for protesting a decision late in the second half as @entity4 won their first @entity6 in 17 years			1
the scrappy contest that featured more than a dozen yellow cards and two reds was settled by @entity60 's header in the eighth minute of extra time on a night when it seemed @entity4 , which had n't beaten their city rivals since 1999 , were destined to lift the trophy			1
after @entity51 opened the scoring in the 14th minute with a typically impressive header , @entity65 leveled on a counter attack in the 35th after superb work by striking partner @entity70			2
@entity2 struck the post three times prior to the game entering extra time and @entity4 keeper @entity75 made two stunning saves to preserve the victory and help end his team 's three - match losing streak in @entity6 finals			1
the affair turned ugly in the dying minutes , with @entity51 given a straight red card for kicking out at @entity83 and players from both benches having to be separated			1
@entity75 fell to the ground when struck by an item thrown from the stands at @entity2 's home stadium			1
@entity0 believed his team should have lifted the cup and had been plain unlucky			0
" the result is 1 - 1 and it is not normal to hit the post three times , " he said			0
" you do n't have to be a magician of football to think that the result is not fair , that @entity4 are not the deserved winners of the final			0
" the refereeing is forgotten , the shots off the post are forgotten , all that remains is that the winner is @entity4			2
" winning manager @entity106 was simply delighted while acknowledging their fortune			0
" it was an incredible game			0
we had the luck you need to have to be champions , " he told gathered reporters .			0
