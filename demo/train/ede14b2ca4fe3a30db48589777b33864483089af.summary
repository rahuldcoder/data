-- prediction : 2013 will be a year of serious global crisis			2
that crisis is predictable , and in fact has already begun			0
it will inescapably confront the next president of the @entity7			1
yet this emerging crisis got not a mention at the @entity10 in @entity11			0
we 'll see if the @entity13 do better			0
the crisis originates in this summer 's extreme weather			2
almost 80 % of the continental @entity7 experienced drought conditions			1
@entity17 and @entity18 experienced drought as well			1
the drought has ruined key crops			0
the corn harvest is expected to drop to the lowest level since 1995			0
in just july , prices for corn and wheat jumped about 25 % each , prices for soybeans about 17 %			0
these higher grain prices will flow through to higher food prices			1
for consumers in developed countries , higher food prices are a burden -- but in almost all cases , a manageable burden			1
@entity7 spend only about 10 % of their after - tax incomes on food of all kinds , including restaurant meals and prepackaged foods			1
surveys for @entity42 find that the typical @entity7 family is spending one - third less on food today , adjusting for inflation , than in 1969			1
but step outside the developed world , and the price of food suddenly becomes the single most important fact of human economic life			1
in poor countries , people typically spend half their incomes on food -- and by " food , " they mean first and foremost bread			1
when grain prices spiked in 2007 - 2008 , bread riots shook 30 countries across the developing world , from @entity61 to @entity62 , according to the @entity63			2
@entity65 drought in @entity17 in 2010 forced suspension of @entity17 grain exports that year and set in motion the so - called @entity69 spring			1
since the days of @entity72 , the @entity71 government has provided subsidized bread to the population			2
a disk of round flat bread costs about a penny			0
in the later 2000s , however , the @entity79 government found it could not keep pace with surging grain costs			0
as @entity71 's population doubled from 20 million in 1950 to 40 million in 1980 and now more than 80 million , @entity71 has gained first place as the world 's largest wheat importer			1
the price rises of 2007 - 2010 exceeded the @entity79 government 's resources			2
cheap bread vanished from the stores			0
in the august 18 issue of the @entity95 magazine @entity94 , @entity96 , an @entity97 - speaking journalist long resident in @entity71 , described what happened next : Â " the conversations of tiny groups of @entity104 's @entity103 - speaking elites , and their @entity106 drinking companions , were a world apart from talk among the @entity71 masses			1
... the main hope of those who poured into @entity112 was shared by the revolutionaries in @entity114 : that sudden and radical change would miraculously mean affordable food			1
" and if food prices surge again ? @entity118 is especially vulnerable to food cost inflation			1
in just one month , july 2011 , the cost of living jumped 6.5 %			0
inflation happily subsided over the course of 2012			0
springtime hopes for a bumper @entity7 grain crop in 2012 enabled the @entity118 central bank to ease credit in the earlier part of the summer			2
now the @entity118 authorities will face some tough choices over what to do next			0
the @entity132 of 2011 is sometimes compared to the revolutions of 1848			0
that 's apter than people realize : the " hungry ' 40s " were years of bad harvests across @entity137			0
hungry people are angry people , and angry people bring governments down			0
will 2013 bring us social turmoil in @entity144 , strikes in @entity118 or revolution in @entity146 ? the answer can probably be read in the price indexes of the commodities exchanges -- and it is anything but @entity150 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2

@entity153 : the drought in the @entity7 , @entity17 and @entity18 is driving up food prices
he says sharp rises in prices have long been tied to *unrest* among the world 's poor
high prices have been cited as a cause of last year 's upheaval in @entity71 and @entity114 , he says
@entity169 : the *winner* of *november* *election* in @entity7 will have to deal with the consequences
