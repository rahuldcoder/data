-- everyone 's a critic ; i get that			1
but does everyone have to be a historian , too ? what audiences perceive as their inalienable right to challenge the accuracy and authenticity of movies seems to get much more exercised before the @entity12 than at any other time of the year			1
the latest challenge came tuesday from rep. @entity15 of @entity16 , who said @entity23 's " @entity22 " misrepresented the way his predecessors in the 1865 @entity19 voted on the 13th amendment banning slavery			1
@entity15 looked it up online and found in his research that all four @entity16 representatives voted for the amendment -- the movie shows two voting against			2
so in a letter to @entity23 's @entity32 production office in @entity33 , he asked @entity32 for some form of correction			1
( @entity32 has n't been heard from yet			0
) the film , considered a favorite for a best picture @entity12 , places the back - and - forth struggle over the amendment in the forefront of its depiction of the 16th president , played by @entity44			1
@entity15 , unlike most others who have complained about big - time @entity12 contenders , is n't out to ruin anybody 's chances			1
he says he likes everything else about the movie			0
he merely wants props restored to his home state			0
and he seems to have a good case			0
but you can bet your annual subscription to @entity56 that the chatterboxes who gossip about and / or handicap the @entity12 are going to try using his complaint as further indication of " @entity22 's " slipping stature as a best picture shoo - in			1
some of these pundits claim " @entity68 " is charging hard from behind since its unexpected wins at both the @entity66 and @entity67			1
and yet " @entity68 " has truthiness issues of its own			1
director - star @entity71 even admitted before the movie 's release last fall that his movie about the 1979 @entity76 rescue of @entity78 employees from @entity79 stretched certain details for dramatic effect			1
( spoiler alert ! ) there was , for instance , no last - minute car chase on a @entity87 tarmac as @entity88 tried to escape on a plane , and their check - in at the terminal was n't in real life nearly the white - knuckle sequence of events you see in the film			0
others have said the movie misrepresents the @entity79 people as completely unified in their support of the takeover of the @entity88 embassy			0
" thirty - three million @entity79 ... did not commit acts of murder and terrorism , " @entity79 commentator @entity103 wrote on @entity104			0
" thirty - three million @entity79 did not chant ' death to @entity88 ! ' or take @entity88 hostage			0
" but neither " @entity22 " nor " @entity68 " has reaped the whirlwind of criticism of @entity113 's " @entity112 " for its depiction of events leading up to the 2011 killing of @entity117			1
even before its limited release in december , the movie could n't be discussed without referring to those accusing the movie of glorifying waterboarding of suspected terrorists or , at best , misleading audiences into believing that such so - called " enhanced interrogation " played a key role in guiding the @entity88 to @entity117			0
whatever critics or defenders say , the dispute alone is enough to make academy voters skittish about rewarding something that causes so much trouble			0
you have to wonder : what is the big deal ? none of these films are documentaries and thus do not have the same obligations to fact			1
yet one could argue that taking too many liberties with real life ( whatever that means ) could distort for generations the true story ; that , indeed , what is enhanced for dramatic purposes becomes what everyone believes is what actually happened			0
it 's not so cut and dried			2
consider @entity158 's 1915 " @entity157 , " regarded as the first great @entity88 film epic , whose glorification of the @entity155 makes contemporary audiences uneasy at best , infuriated at worst			2
despite protests by the @entity162 and other civil rights organizations , audiences generally agreed with president @entity165 's purported assessment of the movie : " it 's like history written with lightning			1
" but society can change perception of art over time to the point of neutralizing , even transfiguring its original intent			1
no one now mistakes @entity158 's movie as anything close to historic fact , but it could still be seen as a representation of a racist viewpoint that once held sway over much of @entity88 then there is @entity185 , the great @entity88 director of such classic westerns as " @entity187 " ( 1939 ) , " @entity188 " ( 1956 ) and " @entity189 " ( 1962 )			2
it was in the latter movie that @entity193 's aesthetic credo was put forth by a minor character , a journalist who discovers that the career - making triumph of a @entity88 senator over an outlaw did n't happen as originally believed			2
the journalist chooses to keep things status quo			0
" this is the @entity203 , sir , " he explains			0
" when legend becomes fact , print the legend			0
" he might have added : " because it makes a better story			0
" or consider " @entity209 , " @entity193 's 1946 version of the @entity212 saga			2
as the movie opens , the @entity212 brothers are herding cattle to @entity216 , @entity217 , in 1882 when the youngest brother @entity218 is shot dead ( in the back , of course ) by the rustling @entity222 family			0
three things , right off the bat are wrong : @entity218 was the eldest of the @entity226 , not the youngest , the @entity212 brothers never had any cattle either heading toward or ensconced within @entity216 's city limits and , though @entity218 ' death is depicted as the spark that eventually led to the @entity226 ' confrontation with the @entity232 at the @entity233 , that famous gunfight actually occurred in 1881 -- if you 're scoring , that 's one year earlier			1
and the inaccuracies only begin there			0
and yet the movie endures as one of @entity193 's best even after four movies about the same legend have been made , each claiming to be more faithful to historic fact than " @entity244			2
" but " @entity209 , " a dream about a past that did n't exist , endures in collective memory			0
it may not be factual , but it 's true to something ; a vision , a state of mind , an aspiration to something we wish had been , or could be			1
the most recent film about the legend , @entity261 's " @entity212 " ( 1994 ) , is so faithful that you can barely remember anything about it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity264 .			1

@entity264 : " @entity22 " error on *emancipation* vote shines light on how films tell history
he says @entity12 chances for " @entity68 , " " @entity112 " may be hurt after facts questioned
he says films have long gotten history wrong but are useful in showing society 's perceptions
@entity281 : it 's art , not history , sometimes a vision , something we wish had been or could be
