-- in the very early hours of this morning , " do n't ask , do n't tell " ceased to be @entity2 policy			1
as a result , today is the first day i can write about being the partner of a gay military serviceman without fear that he will lose his job			1
in december , sen. @entity9 voiced his opposition to repealing dadt and reminded @entity2 it was in the middle of two wars			1
at the time , my partner was on a yearlong deployment in @entity17			2
my better half is a commander in the @entity20 who has served his country for more than 23 years			0
he has deployed more than eight times , flying missions for @entity24 ( @entity25 ) , @entity26 ( @entity27 ) and @entity28			0
during his year in @entity17 , he provided support for @entity30			0
when @entity9 , @entity32 , stood up in the @entity33 to defend the feelings of homophobic servicemen and women , gay active - duty personnel were unable to speak out			2
by doing so they would have " outed " themselves and lost their jobs			2
in spite of this , repeal passed , due in no small part to public opinion massively favoring repeal ( 67 % according to a december 2010 @entity46 poll )			0
had my partner been able to openly share his experience , he might have highlighted @entity9 's arguments about repeal of @entity11 affecting morale , recruitment and retention as moot points			1
in @entity17 , my partner worked and lived alongside @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 troops , to name just a few			2
with nearly every @entity61 country allowing gay men and women to serve openly in their militaries , @entity9 would have had to forgo multinational operations and coalitions in order to fully " protect " his soldiers from exposure to " openly gay " personnel			0
though repeal of @entity11 was won , there are @entity2 , specifically some @entity74 presidential candidates , who would reinstate it			1
now that gay military personnel can be visible , in my view , they should be			1
in short , with " do n't ask , do n't tell " gone , it 's time to tell			0
the battle has only been half won			0
gay servicemen or servicewomen can no longer be discharged simply for being gay , but they are still treated inequitably			0
only by using their newly won free speech can they hope to reap the same benefits as their straight colleagues			0
let me give you some examples			0
when a member of the @entity2 military marries , he or she effectively gets a pay raise through an increased housing allowance			1
even after repeal , this benefit will not accrue to married same - sex couples			1
when a married service member is sent away from his spouse on a tour of duty , the couple is entitled to a family separation allowance			0
again this will not apply to married same - sex couples			1
if my partner and i were married and if the law allowed both of these benefits to accrue to him while he was in @entity17 -- as they would if he were in a straight marriage -- we would have received an additional $ 10,000 that year			1
the inequality does n't stop at pay either			0
same - sex partners of military personnel are also denied dependent identification cards			1
this meant that when my partner was hospitalized in 2009 , i had no way of independently gaining access to the @entity20 hospital where he was treated without a special " hospital visitation authorization			2
" moreover , whether my partner and i are married or not , today i would still have no access to the shops , gas stations or recreational facilities available to other military spouses on base			1
i would also not be entitled to spousal health care benefits if we are married			2
perhaps most cruelly of all , @entity132 gay military spouses are still not entitled to survivor benefits if a partner is killed in the line of duty			1
they also remain ineligible to be buried with their spouse if he or she is buried in a military cemetery			0
gay military spouses sacrifice just as much as their straight brothers and sisters			1
we relocate with them when they receive new orders and in turn we give up our jobs , friends and lives to support their careers			0
despite this , we are denied the support and safety nets afforded our straight counterparts			0
with @entity11 gone , we should no longer suffer in silence			2
the military benefits system needs to change			2
if the benefits currently unavailable to gay military families were similarly unavailable to @entity162 , black or female service members , i have no doubt the situation would be rectified immediately			1
there needs to be a public outcry , and it needs to come from active duty gay personnel , their partners , families , friends , colleagues and the public at large			0
for this to happen , the public has to see and understand that a significant proportion of the men and women in uniform protecting them are gay			0
in the coming days and weeks , i urge all gay military personnel and their partners to come out , where appropriate , to their families , co-workers , even their @entity184 friends			1
do this not to share the innermost details of your private life , but to begin the fight for the recognition and rewards you deserve as true @entity2 heroes			2
furthermore , when the likes of a @entity194 or a @entity195 propose reinstating @entity11 , let them be challenged by decorated gay marines , sailors , soldiers , airmen and coastguards and asked : why should they and their partners be treated as second - class citizens ? why should they , as patriots who have spilled blood for their country , be treated anything less than equally by their employer and the government they defend ? having read this far , you 'll be aware that i have not named my partner			1
if he wants to come out to his employer and colleagues , and i would encourage him to do so , i firmly believe they should hear it from him first			0
being honest about your sexuality and standing up for your right to be treated equally does n't have to involve a public announcement			0
there will be colleagues you want to tell and members of the military hierarchy that you should tell , specifically those denying you equal pay and benefits , but there will also be colleagues who have no business knowing			1
families have just reason to be proud of sons and daughters who serve in the @entity2 military			1
they should be prouder still to know that service was given in the face of unequal reward and above - average sacrifice			0
the danger for gay military personnel is that , having spent years being forced to hide and tell half - truths , they continue to remain invisible			1
without visibility , the arguments of those opposed to equality are easier for the public to believe			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			2

@entity251 : @entity11 ending ; he can freely write about his gay *servicemember* partner
he says @entity11 kept gay *servicemember*s from speaking out for fear of losing jobs
he says many rights are still denied them , particularly for married same - sex couples
@entity251 : why should gay military who defended @entity2 be denied equal access to benefits ?
