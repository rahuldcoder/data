@entity0 -- a soldier lies in a pool of blood in the middle of a nondescript inner - city @entity0 street			1
his two apparent killers brandish bloodied kitchen knives and meat cleavers			1
one of them rants at a passer - by who films the whole extraordinary encounter on a mobile phone			1
these shocking images are unlike anything seen before on the streets of @entity18 , where the murder rate is one of the lowest in the world and where police officers do not routinely carry guns			1
@entity0 attack : terrorists targeting soldiers at home again ? there is little sense of panic among the dozens of witnesses , some of whom argue rationally with the suspected killer			1
if the @entity18 can still be characterized as being hard to panic with stiff upper lips , this street scene was a bizarre illustration			1
others mill round taking photos -- as if a celebrity has arrived			2
at one point a woman with a shopping trolley even walks past the man without changing course as he makes his radical statement			1
in the distance is the sound of police sirens : later the men will be shot -- although both survive -- by armed officers			1
this is suburban @entity0 on a quiet day in may 2013			1
the attack , which is being treated as a suspected terrorist incident by the @entity18 government , begins in a fairly anonymous road in @entity58 , a deprived largely blue - collar neighborhood in comparison to its historic neighbors @entity61 and @entity62			2
the area was hit hard , as was much of @entity0 , by the summer riots of 2011 , when several shops and properties were burned to the ground			1
but beyond that violence is rare : thousands of visitors attended @entity71 shooting events last year at the army barracks where the soldier was heading , without incident			1
at 2.20pm on wednesday , a small blue @entity76 hatchback with blacked - out windows mounts the sidewalk of @entity79 and mows down a soldier			1

the two attackers get out of the car , then fall on @entity86 , stabbing and slashing him to death with their knives and cleavers before they drag his body into the @entity102			2
the murder brings the mid-afternoon traffic on @entity105 , just yards from the busy arterial @entity107 , to a standstill			0
from the relative safety of a stationary bus , passengers start to film : later the footage will be broadcast by the world 's media			0
one clip starts by showing the car smashed into a lamp - post : then the camera pans round to show that this is no ordinary traffic accident			2
the footage reveals that the victim lying in the road being tenderly stroked by a passer - by			1
we do not know at this stage at what point @entity86 died			0
watch : terrorism analyst on soldier killing about 50 yards behind the commotion a silent crowd of people has gathered to watch proceedings			2
one woman , apparently oblivious to the unfolding carnage , casually walks past the scene carrying her shopping bag			1
in one clip that will later be streamed on a newspaper website , one bus passenger feels sufficiently emboldened to leave the vehicle while filming -- even though it is far from clear that the attackers will not strike out at other people			2
then , amazingly , one of the two suspected assailants walks up to the camera in an agitated state			0
he is dressed in black and wearing a black beanie hat , his hands drenched in blood			0
in his left hand he grips a knife and machete			0
opinion : the real enemy in @entity0 hacking death the suspect begins to address the camera , as if explaining himself to a wider audience that goes beyond those gathered on the street			1
" the only reason we killed this man today is because muslims are dying daily by @entity18 soldiers , " he begins			2
" and this @entity18 soldier is one			2
it is an @entity169 and a tooth for a tooth			0
i apologize that women had to witness this today but in our lands our women have to see the same			0
you people will never be safe			0
they do n't care about you			0
you think @entity182 is going to get caught in the street when we start busting our guns , you think politicians are going to die ? " at this point in his rant , an elderly woman pulling a shopping trolley bustles past the man without even slowing and continues on her way			1
" no , it 's going to be the average guy like you , and your children			0
so , get rid of them			0
tell them to bring our troops back so we can all live in peace			0
" he then walks back up the road , towards the victim and a second man with whom he has a conversation			0
they make no attempt to flee the scene			0
instead they walk up and down the street , having heated conversations with passers - by , some of whom plead with the pair to refrain from further violence			1
one such bystander , @entity222 , will later tell the @entity224 newspaper she spoke to one of the attackers			1
" he was very excited and he told me not to get close to the body			0
i did n't really feel anything			0
i was not scared because he was not drunk , he was not on drugs			0
i could speak to him and he wanted to speak and that 's what we did			0
" @entity236 , a passenger on the bus , will tell reporters that she asked the suspect what he was going to do next			2
" he said it was a war and if the police were coming , he was going to kill them			2
i asked him if that was a reasonable thing to do but it was clear that he really wanted to do that			0
he talked about war but he did not talk about dying and then he left to speak to someone else			2
" but the violence is not yet over			2
fourteen minutes after the attack , police say , armed officers arrive			1
according to eyewitnesses , the two attackers , one of whom was brandishing a handgun , charged at the officers who opened fire , wounding both of the men			2
the men are left at the scene while crowds surge around them , according to media reports			0
a police helicopter then arrives to take the men under armed guard to separate @entity0 hospitals			1
a large section of @entity58 is sealed off for the evening by forensics officers who comb the area around @entity105 for evidence			0
wednesday 's attack is not the first time that soldiers in @entity58 have been visited with violence			0
in 1974 a bomb was thrown through the window of the @entity279 pub at the far end of @entity105 , killing a gunner as well as a sales clerk			0
the @entity283 claimed responsibility for that attack -- but unlike the two attackers on wednesday , they were far less brazen			0
they fled after the bombing and went on to kill more than 30 others in a 14 - month campaign across @entity0 before surrendering to police in december 1975 following a six - day siege			1
wednesday 's killing is the first jihadist attack that has killed a victim since the july 7 , 2005 bombings in @entity0 that killed 52 people and the four bombers			1
just like the 1970s @entity283 bombing campaign and the 7/7 attacks , it is likely to resonate in @entity0 and the wider @entity18 society for a long period .			1

as soldier lay dying in @entity0 street , apparent attackers posed for photos
little sense of panic , one woman shoved past suspect as he ranted to a passer - by
one bystander said she pleaded with the suspect to refrain from further violence
two suspects were shot by police , and were taken to hospital under armed guard
