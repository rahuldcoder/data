-- @entity1 aims to open up the media landscape to divergent voices a little bit at a time			1
in march , she helped launch interrupt magazine , initially a webzine , so these other perspectives can join in the media conversation			1
its first issue is devoted to body image			2
@entity1 is familiar with how women are portrayed in the media			1
she has been a model for brands such as @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21 and has appeared in the pages of @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 she is also known for her @entity28 talk , " looks are n't everything , " about those who win the genetic lottery and how society rewards the conventionally beautiful			1
to celebrate @entity35 's launch , she 's inviting the public to an art lab called " @entity40 " on @entity39 's @entity38 through monday			1
it 's at 215 @entity42 @entity0 spoke recently with @entity1 about her new project			1
@entity0 : how did the idea come about ? @entity1 : i had been thinking about an online participatory magazine for a while			1
after the amazing response to my @entity28 talk , my @entity49 - based art lab decided it was time to make this a reality			1
at the @entity56 , we build participatory art and media platforms for causes , communities and organizations we care about			1
i run the magazine with @entity63 and @entity64 as well as hundreds of collaborators who provide writing , photos , editing help and moral support			2
@entity0 : why interrupt ? @entity1 : statistics show that diversity in the media is pretty dismal			1
critical voices from women and people of color are missing from many important conversations			1
ever watch a panel about immigration without any immigrants ? abortion without any women ? marriage rights without any @entity84 people ? we knew it 's crazy to start another media platform , but we came across many authentic voices online and offline that we felt we can bring together and showcase			1
sometimes you just need to interrupt ! @entity0 : what are highlights in the first issue ? @entity1 : it 's all about body image			1
we found out that about 50 % of 8 - year - old girls do n't like their bodies			0
but it 's not just girls			0
many women said they could n't remember a time when they liked their bodies -- they could n't remember what that felt like			2
we collaborated with @entity35 photographer @entity103 who interviewed girls under the age of 8 asking what they liked about their bodies			0
their answers illuminated a perspective that was missing from mass - media conversations			1
these girls liked their bodies because they functioned well ! instead of the usual negative views -- i 'm too fat or i do n't like my nose -- these girls appreciated the fact that they can draw with their hands and run fast with their legs			0
their story was a huge success and got over 5,000 shares			0
then there 's @entity121 , a transgender woman who wrote about trying to find the right bra			0
her story is not exactly something the mainstream press would cover			0
but when we posted her advice to our @entity130 site it became one of the most popular stories			0
the lesson here is that when we value a narrow range of experiences and perspectives , we do n't just have a media that lack diversity , we actually underestimate our audiences			2
there are n't just a few types of experiences that matter -- there are countless			0
@entity0 : with so many publications going digital only , what made you decide to put out a magazine ? @entity1 : our first print issue is a mock tabloid			1
starting this week , it is appearing for free in nail salons , newsstands , dentist offices and other not - so - hidden places around @entity39			0
improving access to media means not just focusing on early adopters			2
we are spending our resources on building a community of collaborators who can share unique and critical views			2
@entity0 : what 's been the most interesting experience in launching @entity35 ? @entity1 : actually , i think working on the offline @entity164 we wanted to build a space where people felt comfortable and genius in their identity			1
we have two selfie walls because taking a selfie is an innate and obvious way that draws in a lot of young people			2
we have a " you are a genius ' bar , where people can explore online resources for social services , civic engagement , health and well - being , and creative production			1
having a physical offline space where children , teenagers and random passers - by can come in and get involved is amazing			0
check them out on our @entity130 feed			0
many of these people spent over an hour here , took pictures , wrote pieces for the next issue and hung out			2
sometimes , great collaboration is hard to nurture online so doing so offline is the way to go			0
we hope to run another one this fall			0
@entity0 : how do you get the word out ? @entity1 : the first several hundred submissions came from people who found out about the project online , mostly through @entity204			1
now that we 're deeper into the project , we 've cultivated many more collaborations			0
for example , ( check out ) a cool piece we did with teens at @entity209 in @entity210			0
we 've found artists like @entity212 , who made a piece that is drawing the most attention in the @entity164 @entity0 : what 's the biggest difference between your webzine and say @entity219 ? @entity1 : there are a ton of new media startups heavily focused on getting huge traffic and high growth , but that 's not our central goal			1
we want to build something that disrupts the way we think media can be made			2
can interrupt make an impact ? @entity1 : every time someone who is n't a " media maker " creates something that goes viral , every time someone whose perspective is left out of mainstream media proves to make an impact , every time a contributor collaborates with someone new to make better work , we improve the media landscape a little bit			1
@entity0 : what did you want to be when you grow up ? @entity1 : i always wanted to become president ! when i was a kid , i was obsessed with politics			2
the first long book i remember reading was ( @entity251 ) @entity252 's " @entity250 " in fourth grade			0
but as i learned more about our democracy , i realized that who participates , who votes and who gets elected is not as simple as it seems			0
that got me interested in how to bring people together and ignite alternative networks of power , and that 's why i started the @entity265 @entity0 : who are your heroes ? @entity1 : i 'm inspired by the people i work with			1
at the @entity271 , we have three incredible artists			0
@entity212 makes enormous participatory public art pieces			2
@entity274 is a young woman who creates very large - scale work			0
when i saw her photos , i knew she was perfect to do our dream selfie wall background			0
and then there 's the graffiti artist and muralist known as miss163			0
she is a joy to work with , and her piece is all about love , which is great for us since one of our upcoming issues is about @entity84			0
@entity0 : if you can give one piece of advice to young women , what would it be ? @entity1 : when boys at school told me i could n't play their game , my mom told me to ask : " why , do you need a penis to play ? "			1

@entity1 , a model known for her @entity28 talk about beauty , helps launch magazine
initially a webzine , interrupt magazine invites diverse voices to join the media
@entity1 invites public to visit art lab called " @entity40 " to explore more
@entity1 : critical voices from women , people of color missing from important conversations
