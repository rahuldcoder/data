editor 's note : @entity2 was @entity3 assistant press secretary for president @entity4 from 2001 - 2003 and worked with @entity5 almost three years			1
he 's the founder and ceo of @entity7 , a @entity8 - based communications firm			0
former @entity3 press secretary @entity5 wrote a tell - all book blasting the @entity4 administration			1
( @entity11 ) -- i worked with @entity5 in the @entity13 for almost three years			1
like most people , i liked @entity5 very much			1
but there is zero resemblance between the @entity5 i worked with and the person i have been watching this past week			1
when i first heard about his book , " what happened : inside the @entity24 and @entity26 's @entity25 , " and read some of its excerpts , i tried to give @entity5 the benefit of the doubt and wait to read the book for myself			1
i mean , @entity5 is not some guy who met the president a few times and then decided to write a book , like another staffer did early on			1
this is a guy who had a great affection for the president , and that affection was mutual			0
as i read the book , i kept thinking i would come across evidence to back up the serious allegations @entity5 was making			1
i thought surely there will be some conversation that he claims to have overheard between adviser @entity44 and president @entity4 , crafting some story to cover up the truth about @entity48 or making the @entity49 sound political in nature			0
or , maybe he witnessed some meeting , discovered a memo , or overheard a comment that confirmed his disillusionment			0
and then , i realized this book had no facts to support its ill - timed story			1
this book is false in premise , disappointing in substance and inappropriate in timing			1
first , the premise of the book is flawed for one major reason : this president placed some big bets on the table			2
for one , an attempt to reform the nation 's tragically flawed educational system , which has seen more and more money thrown into it to reward incompetence			0
for another , to go on the offense in a @entity77 after our nation had been in a dangerously na√Øve position for years			2
president @entity4 swung for the fence			0
the president 's efforts on these great issues of our time were not meant to be overnight solutions , but genuine efforts to change a faulty system or make us safer in the long term			0
you can not mistake short - term media coverage for history			0
we will not know for many years how some of these big bets will pay off			2
so , to presume failure , when there is in fact real progress -- economically , politically , and militarily in @entity48 -- is arrogant , short - sighted , and most tragically , undermines the efforts of those making the sacrifice to make @entity105 safer for years to come			2
the timing of this book is very disappointing			1
it is an outright attempt to undermine the president that made @entity5 's career and hurt those who served alongside him for years			1
obviously , had @entity5 actually been disillusioned while he was in the @entity13 -- that would have been the time to share it with those standing shoulder - to - shoulder with him			2
but this takes courage , and that is a lot to ask of a staffer			0
the other option would have been to share these newfound feelings years from now , after the dust is settled and the results from a very significant presidency are tallied			0
to use the platform that he was handed to poison the well from which he drank so freely is hypocritical at best			0
@entity5 was chosen by the president for his loyalty , not his communication prowess			2
and in a tough final year of one of the most - challenging and consequential presidencies in history , this book is quite a thank - you note			0
over the last week , i have been asked two questions over and over			0
first , " what do you think happened to @entity5 ? " and , the second , " how does it make you feel ? " both are tough questions to answer			2
but because i was traveling when the story broke , i was able to process both before being inundated with the opinions of so many others			0
as for what happened to the @entity5 we knew , i believe his is a classic case of what bitterness and an inability to forgive can do to you			1
while @entity5 had some valid disagreements with some of the other staff about the situation he was put in during the @entity159 case -- simmering for two years about it seemed to change him			1
and as for how i feel , well , it makes me sad that he forced the rest of us to choose between a friend that we respected and a president we love			0
i believe @entity5 's judgment was clouded and his memory distorted during his effort to revise his personal history and -- as he states in the opening pages of the book -- find " his own version of the truth			1
" i happen to believe there is just one version of the truth , and it is nowhere to be found in this book .			0

@entity2 worked with @entity5 for nearly three years in @entity3
@entity2 believes @entity5 book is false , disappointing , badly timed
@entity2 : this is a classic case of what bitterness and being *unforgiving* can do
