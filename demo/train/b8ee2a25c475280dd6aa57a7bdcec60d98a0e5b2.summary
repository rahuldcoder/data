-- it 's been more than two months since their beloved 13 - year - old dog @entity4 passed away from cancer , but @entity6 and her family are still reeling from the loss			1
" it 's very sad , actually , " she tells people			2
" we 're all in that sort of trauma where we have her ashes and the girls ( @entity17 , 8 , and @entity18 , 5 ) carry these little footprints of hers around			2
she was the only dog we 've really ever had			2
" the @entity23 bulldog was given to @entity6 as a puppy , and was a member of the family , taking a central role in many memories over the years			1
" she knew i was pregnant before i even knew i was pregnant , " @entity6 says			1
