-- it could have been a bunch of pip - pip , stiff - upper - lip @entity2 blather about a stuttering king who learns to stop worrying and love the microphone			1
instead , " @entity9 " -- a crowning achievement powered by a dream cast -- digs vibrant human drama out of the dry dust of history			1
@entity11 ( @entity12 ) -- father of the present @entity13 -- found his own dr. @entity14 in @entity15 ( @entity16 ) , a wildly eccentric @entity18 speech therapist who made it possible for the stammering monarch to go on radio in 1939 and rally his subjects to support the declaration of war on @entity26 's @entity25			1
@entity0 : @entity27 reviews " @entity9 " in his weekly video series , " at the movies with @entity27 " " @entity9 " plays out on the battlefield of words , not action			1
writer @entity33 ( doing keenly insightful work partly owing to his own bouts with a stammer ) had conceived the story first as a play			1
before you can think the words " static " and " confining , " be advised that director @entity41 , garlanded with @entity43 dust for " @entity44 , " " @entity45 , " " @entity46 " and " prime suspect , " breathes fresh , urgent life into every frame of this powerhouse			2
@entity41 , 37 , is a prodigious talent			2
the emotion this film produces is staggering			2
@entity41 begins in 1925 , as the king , then merely @entity11 , is trying to speak at the @entity55			2
the words stick in his throat , and his silences between syllables fill the stadium			2
the prince 's embarrassment is acute , and deeply felt by his compassionate wife , @entity13 ( a superb @entity64 creates miracles with every subtle look and gesture ) , who goads him to visit @entity15			0
his highness goes into heavy snob mode in the presence of this commoner , who demands that they use first names			0
when @entity15 first calls @entity75 , " @entity12 's poleaxed reaction is priceless			1
@entity15 treats speech lessons like therapy sessions , pushing for details about life in the royal family			0
what he gets is a portrait of a blowhard father , @entity84 ( @entity85 ) , and a taunting brother , @entity87 ( @entity88 is absolutely stellar ) , who reduces the proud , vulnerable @entity11 to rubble by committing the one unforgivable sin : @entity87 abdicates the throne to marry @entity94 divorcee @entity93 ( @entity95 ) , leaving @entity75 to succeed him			0
suddenly , the man who would not be king most assuredly is			0
@entity0 : @entity27 ' holiday movie preview : ten movies for escapism this season @entity12 's nuanced brilliance is a thing of bruised beauty			1
@entity104 - nominated last year for " @entity105 , " he gives a towering performance that deserves a shower of awards			1
and @entity16 is his match , fiercely funny in the hilarious and heartfelt interactions between king and commoner			0
@entity15 is a failed actor given to grand gestures , and @entity16 chows down on this feast of a role , jolting the movie to life			0
@entity12 plays the counterpoint , the blue blood bred to hold it all together			1
it 's uproarious to watch @entity15 prod @entity75 to lose his cool , forcing him to sing out a symphony of s * * t - f * * * - b * * * er - me swearing ( all stammer - free )			0
luckily , this release takes place in @entity15 's home , where his wife and children are unaware of the royal patient			0
the scene in which @entity15 's wife , @entity134 ( @entity133 ) , meets the king has a special poignancy , if you remember @entity133 and @entity12 as lovers in tv 's " @entity139			1
" " @entity9 " does n't have the budget to show coronations and pomp , but it misses nothing in resonant intimacy			1
@entity41 , with a @entity2 father and @entity18 mother , throws himself into the scene in which @entity15 stands like a conductor in front of the king as he delivers the speech of his life			0
two men alone create an epic landscape of feeling in one of the very best movies of the year			0
