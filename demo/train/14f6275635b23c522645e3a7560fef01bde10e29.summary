-- even if you 're not going to @entity2 or the @entity3 , accidentally ending up in a popular honeymooning spot while not actually on your honeymoon is easier than you think , especially with the abundance of all - inclusive deals online			1
just because your hotel mates are on a romantic getaway does n't mean they 're not open to company			2
if watching smooching couples while chilling out with your friends makes you want to puke , no worries			0
you can still have a blast , even if you 're not traveling with your newly committed soul mate			1
relax you probably chose the fantastic place because you found a great deal to an amazing destination ( much like your cuddling neighbors ) , so take advantage			2
hit the spa , do some yoga , swim or make time for the mellow activities that are tough to fit in back home			1
while you probably wo n't meet the guy of your dreams lying motionless in a mud wrap , you 'll be zen enough to have a new outlook once your return home			0
do n't underestimate the locals ( or the ex-patriot ) there 's nothing better than getting to know a place by hanging out with people who can tell you more than a guidebook about the area 's culture and hidden gems			1
have a glass of wine and chat up the bartender ( or the person with the best @entity46 if you 're abroad ) or find out about an area of town where the ex-patriots live			0
especially if you 've been away from home for a long time , an @entity52 omelet or bagel can keep you smiling			0
make friends just because your hotel mates are using the vacation as a romantic getaway does n't mean that they are not open to meeting others on their travels			0
there 's a chance you 'll end up chatting with a couple who bores you with the details of their wedding , but you might luck out and make a few friends ( who perhaps will save you seats at the breakfast buffet the next morning )			2
plan activities jet skiing , para-gliding , r.v. treks -- take advantage of all the offerings , that way you 'll have fun and burn some of the calories you 've packed on by sipping cocktails on the beach all day			0
besides experiencing new things , you may run across others who have unknowingly booked the same @entity85 deal without any romantic intentions			0
come prepared with portable board games , books , cards and an unlimited amount of @entity92 - fueled music , keeping busy in a honeymoon spot can seem a bit like summer camp ( but with booze )			1
use the time a couple might spend in their room getting busy to work on your @entity101 skills , or catch up on all the new music you 've downloaded but have yet to hear			2
and if you forgot your @entity92 , do n't like spas , and ca n't find anyone in the entire city who is n't newly married and in love , you and your travel - mates can always place bets on which honeymooning couple will be the first to break up			1
