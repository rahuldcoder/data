@entity0 -- the legitimacy of @entity4 's military - backed government is being put to the test as the country voted on a new constitution after years of political turmoil and deadly violence			1
the result of the referendum wo n't be announced for another few days			2
but there 's little doubt it will be approved by a landslide , since opposition has largely been silenced through intimidation and arrests			0
after two days of voting , polls closed at 9 p.m. ( 2 p.m. et ) wednesday , state tv reported , showing images of clear plastic bins being sealed with zip - ties			1
the question is whether the voter turnout will be high enough to bolster the government that took power after the military ousted former @entity30 leader @entity29 from the presidency last year			1
a strong participation would translate into support for gen. @entity34 , the military chief behind the coup and interim government			2
if the draft constitution is passed , elections are expected to follow			1
some predict @entity34 will run for president			0
observers are watching to see if participation is above 33 %			0
that 's the percentage of voters who turned out for the former @entity47 - backed constitution			2
military rule popular with @entity50 , study finds violence on day 1 @entity50 security forces arrested 125 people on the second day of voting , the official news agency @entity52 reported			1
they were arrested for rioting and trying to obstruct the electoral process , @entity52 said			0
the first day of polling was already marred by outbreaks of unrest			1
the @entity60 said nine people died tuesday in violence related to the referendum			1
clashes were reported in several provinces			0
at least four were killed in @entity66 and one in @entity68 in clashes between supporters of the @entity30 and security			2
violations reported by rights groups monitoring the vote ranged between campaigning for " yes " votes inside or near polling stations and preventing @entity78 voters from reaching polling stations in parts of @entity4 , which has a history of sectarian strife and is known for the strong presence of @entity47 groups			1
tuesday 's deaths were the latest twist in three years of political upheaval marked by two presidential departures and hundreds of deaths			1
deep political divide the referendum is the first national vote since the ouster of the democratically elected president @entity29			2
the proposed text would change the constitution to ban religious parties and give more power to the military			1
a deep political divide is evident between supporters of the interim military government and defenders of @entity29			2
plenty of people voting at polling stations tuesday expressed support for @entity34 and the draft constitution			1
" @entity50 ' vote today shows that they are completely against the former regime and they welcome the road map , " said @entity108			2
but others say that voices of dissent have been muzzled			0
" the scary part is that opposition is no longer tolerated , even for political parties , " said @entity115 , a spokesman for the liberal @entity116			0
authorities have cracked down on the @entity30 since @entity29 's ouster , rounding up the movements leaders and making membership illegal			0
opinion : is @entity4 back where it was in 2011 ? constitutional changes @entity50 voted on the last constitution in december 2012 , while @entity29 was still in power			1
but that constitution was suspended after the military deposed him in july			2
the latest proposal differs from the last constitution in several ways			0
some say the draft constitution would mean improved human rights and freedom of expression			1
the new version explicitly states that women are equal to men and allows them to hold official and judicial posts , @entity138 said			0
the new articles would also give parliament the right to impeach the president in the event of a breach of the provisions of the constitution , @entity138 said			0
other new articles would criminalize torture , discrimination and arbitrary forced displacement			0
critics say the latest draft would give too much power to the military without any civilian oversight			1
for example , the draft gives tremendous leeway to the army to try civilians in military courts -- something many @entity50 have opposed for years			1
@entity29 's opponents said he was a tyrant trying to impose conservative values , but @entity29 's supporters say that the military has now returned to the authoritarian practices of longtime ruler @entity171 , who was deposed in a popular uprising in 2011			0
hundreds died in clashes between @entity50 security forces and @entity29 supporters in the weeks that followed his ouster			1
@entity29 has been in detention since july and faces charges of inciting the murders of at least three protesters outside the presidential palace in 2012			0
the protests were over the constitution that @entity29 shepherded into effect			0
@entity187 reported from @entity0 , and @entity188 wrote from @entity189			0
