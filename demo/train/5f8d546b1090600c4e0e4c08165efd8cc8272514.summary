@entity0 will have a major leadership change soon when the current leaders , president @entity3 and premier @entity4 , bow out			2
in the @entity8 era , @entity0 leadership change and power transition have become institutionalized and more predictable			2
that 's until the somewhat unexpected @entity11 affair			1
although the sacking of the @entity15 leader -- in the wake of a murder investigation that implicated him and his wife -- revealed the startling degree of widespread corruption and abuse of power among high - ranking leaders , it also exposed the intense struggle among various ideologies of @entity0 's leaders and intellectual elites			0
after three decades of reforms , @entity0 's social economic landscape has been transformed			0
short - term and long - term problems and challenges abound			0
while addressing such problems as inflation , the asset bubble , corruption and increasingly daring expressions of public discontent , @entity0 's leaders and intellectual elites are also searching for long - term legitimacy			0
the challenge has become more pressing , as @entity0 society gets wealthier and more restless after three decades of rapid economic and social change			0
@entity0 is in urgent need of a soul , a set of dominant ideas , as the efficacy of the @entity51 's official ideology -- emphasizing " harmonious society " and " scientific development " -- diminishes			1
despite the party 's calls to " speak with one voice , " dissenting ideas and differences are being voiced and heard			1
unlike the simple dichotomy of reformers and conservatives during the 1980s and early 1990s , today 's sets of views on @entity0 's problems and its future have become more sophisticated and complex			0
the increasingly intense debate now appears to have three strands : the neoliberal reformers who seek to liberalize the economic and political arenas and reverse the recent expansion of the state ; the @entity73 who argue for strengthening the state and breaking what they see as a " state capitalist " alliance between the rich and the powerful ; and the @entity80 traditionalists who bemoan the loss of a moral compass in a modernizing society and want to rekindle @entity0 's soft power in the world			1
dominating the debates and ideological clashes are the neoliberals and the @entity73 who occupy the leadership , while @entity91 , popular as they may be among some common folk and patriotic youths , have yet to find their strong advocates among top leaders			1
why you ca n't expect easy answers with new leadership in a symbolic example of @entity103 ' inability to gain ground , a giant @entity100 statue was removed last year some 100 days after it was unveiled in front of the newly reopened @entity106 in @entity107			0
the statue 's appearance in such a prominent location caused an uproar among neoliberals , neo-maoists and the intellectual elite			1
in the competition for dominant ideas , @entity100 -- whose school of thought has been touted as a call for @entity121 ( " @entity0 peace " ) -- lost in the gigantic square that is bookended by @entity125 's iconic portrait and his mausoleum			1
( the statue now resides in the museum 's sculpture garden , ostensibly for esthetic reconsiderations			0
) the implications of this ideological debate are enormous and will likely determine the future of @entity0			0
the neo-liberals hold the free market and democracy to be universally applicable and deny the uniqueness of the @entity0 experience			1
their power base is @entity141 , where market reforms first served as a pilot test for the nation three decades ago			0
the provincial party secretary , @entity145 , tipped for promotion to the @entity147 , is widely regarded as a daring leader , willing to promote changes based on the market and open society principles			1
pursuing the notion of " fairness and justice , " officials like @entity145 have won the backing of @entity157 for emphasizing opportunities for the weak and underprivileged			2
unlike leaders like @entity11 who used iron - fisted measures when dealing with social discontent , @entity145 has a reputation for listening to netizens , including their criticisms of the government			1
it is not surprising that some of the most liberal news media are based in his province			0
on the other hand , @entity11 , who had been a contender for the @entity147 until his downfall , had been known for advocating @entity174 tactics , including mass rallies and anticrime campaigns to counter problems like organized crime and corruption			1
his programs provided neo-maoists , who oppose " westernization " and are critical of state - capitalist market reforms , with a rallying call for " common wealth and equality " at a time @entity0 is facing a widening wealth gap			1
in a subtle rejection of the " fairness and justice " advocated by neoliberals , the @entity73 see the state as a beneficial force and the market as an evil one			1
to them , @entity0 is unique and can not be remade into the @entity198 ; they reject the idea of a universal model of development			0
@entity11 's " @entity15 experiment " provided @entity0 's neo-maoists with a set of ideas that could compete against the neoliberals ' advocacy of the market and democracy			1
@entity211 and media savvy , @entity11 had populist appeal that garnered local support , but a seeming return to the " redness " of the @entity174 era caused a certain unease among party officials , particularly liberal - bent elders			2
his downfall has put neo-maoists on the retreat , but there are signs they are ready to become vocal , as the new leaders take over			0
read about @entity11 being under criminal investigation behind the fa√ßade of unity that the party has emphasized is a struggle not just for leadership positions but of ideas			1
this struggle will affect major policy decision making , including political reforms			0
it is still too early to predict who will get into the top governing body of the @entity51			2
but ideological orientation will surely be one of the considerations in the jockeying for power			0
as @entity3 's 10 - year term comes to an end , his cautious and above - the - fray approach to economic reforms and ideological debates may have come to an end as well			2
the question is , will any of these disparate sets of ideas be accepted by @entity3 's expected successor as party chief , @entity256 ? his ideological orientations remain unclear , and he may not have an easy time walking a middle path and continuing a mishmash " mainstream " ideology by not choosing sides			2
how he and other key leaders take up stands in this struggle for ideological dominance will be immensely important for @entity0 and its direction in the next decade .			0

despite @entity51 's calls to " speak with one voice , " dissenting ideas , differences being voiced
@entity274 : dominating the debates are the neoliberals and @entity73 who occupy the leadership
neo-liberals see free market , democracy as universal ; @entity145 represents them , @entity274 says
@entity11 , tipped for @entity147 until his fall , neo-maoists touted " common wealth "
