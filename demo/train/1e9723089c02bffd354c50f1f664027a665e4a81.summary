@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 shakes her head at the suggestion , then flashes a contagious smile			2
" it 's still history , " she says , to rebut the notion there could be less intensity for president @entity10 in the @entity12 - @entity12 community the second time around			1
" the first history was that he won			2
the second history 's that he won twice			2
so , it 's not just about history the first time , you have to be concerned about the history for the next four years also			2
you can make history more than one time , you know			2
" her mother and father stand a few feet away , nodding approvingly			2
@entity30 and @entity31 founded @entity33 's @entity32 41 years ago			2
@entity3 takes the lead now , but her parents are on hand helping most days in a shop that is an institution in the @entity40 area of @entity0			2
" we love him , " @entity31 says of @entity10			1
" one of the proudest days of my life was the day he was elected			2
" the @entity46 are determined to see the president re-elected , and are part of an @entity10 campaign ground operation that is active early because of several obstacles to generating the big @entity12 - @entity12 turnout that was critical to then - sen. @entity10 's 2008 victories in many of the major presidential battlegrounds , @entity1 among them			1
our visit this week was timed to coincide with the president 's speech to the @entity58			0
at that meeting , in @entity61 , a major topic of discussion is a new @entity58 study suggesting that if @entity12 - @entity12 turnout in 2012 falls back to 2004 levels , then @entity10 is almost certain to lose @entity66 and would find things much tougher in a handful of other battlegrounds , including @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity1			1
in 2008 , just shy of 65 % of eligible african - americans voted for president ; in 2004 it was 60 %			1
that prospect of lower turnout could change the math in some key battlegrounds even if the president runs roughly equal to his share of the @entity12 - @entity12 vote , an eye - popping 95 % in 2008			1
there are a number of reasons the @entity10 campaign worries that turnout among its most loyal voters could slip some -- and we got a taste of all of them during our visit to @entity0 : economy : @entity12 - @entity12 unemployment is well above the national average			1
history : the prospect of electing the country 's first @entity12 - @entity12 president was unquestionably a factor in the 2008 turnout boost			1
complacency : the president 's win in @entity1 was by 9 points , and republicans have not carried the state in a presidential race since 1988			1
new voter id laws : @entity1 is among the states with a new requirement that voters show photo identification on @entity117			1
@entity33 scowls at the mention of the law			0
" there are people who do n't want him as president and they are trying to suppress the vote , " he says			0
@entity31 says some of her elderly friends do n't have driver 's licenses or other current photo identification			0
" if they keep this law , we will be in bad shape , " she says			0
the @entity46 ask every customer if they are registered to vote , and have forms and literature on hand for those who need help			0
across the street at the @entity10 campaign field office -- one of six in @entity0 -- a table just inside the door is stacked with literature about the new law and its requirements			1
the campaign 's networking with local businesses is part of an unprecedented effort to register and then keep in contact with @entity12 voters			1
@entity155 is a natural fit			0
a 67 - year - old with vivid memories of taking part in civil rights marches in his native @entity162 and now the owner of @entity155 's @entity164 , which contracts with the state to issue driver 's licenses and also sells auto insurance			1
" it 's like a spark , " @entity155 told us during our afternoon visit			0
" when you say , ' @entity10 , ' everybody is very , very enthusiastic about him and you will see each person say to the other person , ' have you registered to vote ? ' " the new @entity178 law is also a hot topic of conversation			1
@entity155 is in that group , but says he has to assume it will stay on the books through november			0
" you hear a lot of talk about suppression , " he says			0
" everyone is making sure they 're having the proper @entity178 and everything to go vote			0
so we reinforce this also			0
" our walk through the neighborhood -- steamy temperature aside -- had more of an october feel than late july ; campaign volunteers were everywhere , asking passersby if they are registered to vote and collaring most of those who answered no. one of the local @entity10 turnout teams has met regularly since the 2008 campaign			1
most of the others took shape beginning a year ago			1
one older volunteer says his only worry is that so many people tell him , " do n't worry , @entity1 is a ca n't - lose			1
' " @entity210 has a quick answer when visitors to his @entity214 barber shop sound complacent about the president 's november odds			0
" we have more at stake , " @entity210 said			1
" we 're either going back to the years of president @entity219 or we 're going to keep moving forward			0
... we have voter registration forms in the back			2
we are recruiting as many people as possible			0
we are not feeling that this is a sure bet			0
we feel we have to stand behind him 100 %			0
" black clergy is always critical to voter turnout in communities like this , and dr. @entity229 says @entity10 can count on his help despite a disagreement over the president 's support for same - sex marriage			1
" we understand that he is not the pastor of the @entity237 -- he is the president of the @entity237 , " said @entity229 , the senior pastor at @entity0 's @entity235			0
after services this past sunday , @entity240 congregants had a chance to get materials on the new voter id law			1
@entity229 says that law could be one factor in driving @entity12 - @entity12 turnout down a bit from 2008			1
but if there is a significant drop , his bet is that the tough economy will be the driving force			0
" the president could do more in that area , " @entity229 said			0
" when you look at the unemployment rate in the @entity12 - @entity12 community , there 's more that can be done			1
" still , @entity229 says things are a bit improved in recent months , and as he tells congregants they must vote , he also says he is banking on a little help in this tougher election climate			2
" the reason i know that everything is going to be all right in november is because i trust in the @entity270 , " @entity229 said			0
" i love the president			0
but i trust in the lord			0

turnout among african - americans could determine result of presidential election
unemployment , voter id laws , complacency could *affect* turnout
@entity10 campaign has unprecedented effort to register , communicate with voters
one @entity287 says there is more at stake this year than in 2008
