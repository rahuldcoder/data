a true revolution does n't come every day			1
the word " revolution " appears all around us , in commercial advertisements and political propaganda , until it seems to have lost all meaning			2
the most minor tumult , the smallest change , and immediately we pronounce the word			0
and so when the real thing arrives , with tyranny and blood , with masses striving for freedom , with an ancient regime destroyed and a new one born , we might just fail to see its significance			2
the spark that began the revolution was something called @entity22 : a trade agreement with the @entity24 that many @entity25 saw as a chance to enter a world of free trade rather than government syndicates , and the rule of law rather than overwhelming corruption			1
when president @entity32 , after months of promised , rejected the deal in november , @entity25 protested			1
the students were the first to reach the " @entity35 , " the main square of @entity37			0
they are the ones who already considered themselves @entity22 , and took a @entity22 future for granted			0
after the riot police were sent to beat them , they were joined by the " @entity45 , " the veterans of the @entity48 war in @entity45			0
then came the businessmen , the professionals , the people who had hoped to make an honest living , but found themselves thwarted by unpredictable taxes and corruption			0
in december , hundreds of thousands of people , from all parts of the country and all walks of life , were on the streets			0
then @entity60 president @entity59 appeared with a proposal			1
why not take 15 billion euros from @entity60 instead of playing around with @entity22 ? although the @entity60 side promised that the loan was without conditions , @entity60 leaders then explained that disbursements could only follow when political stability had been established			1
in january , president @entity32 formally did away with basic freedoms			0
a package of legislation introduced by a @entity73 legislator and rushed illegally through parliament introduced a number of laws that closely resembled @entity60 models			1
@entity25 reacted as @entity78 would if the @entity79 one day disappeared			1
after weeks of peacefully tolerating beatings , torture and disappearances , some of the protesters took the fight to the police			0
once again @entity87 made clear that the next tranche of the loan would depend upon political stability			0
last week a truce was declared , and a day of mourning announced for the protesters who died			0
on the day of mourning , the @entity25 government mounted snipers on rooftops			1
they shot dozens more protesters dead			0
the @entity25 protesters did not do what most of us would have done			1
they did not run away			2
instead they came in ever greater numbers			0
they did not react with a bloody counterattack , as well they might have			0
they simply , and amazingly , built their barricades , stood their ground and said they would give their lives for their freedom			2
at this point , the world began to react -- finally			0
the @entity116 and @entity117 foreign ministers arrived to negotiate the transition that many people had wanted for weeks : a weakening of the @entity32 's power and accelerated elections			2
' we were trapped ' : eyewitness to the massacre in @entity37 this was far more than protesters could have expected before the mass killing , but far less than they wanted afterward			0
the compromise agreement specified that both sides would cease violence			2
@entity32 's police seemed to understand what he did not : that this meant the end of his rule			2
they disappeared from the fight , and ceased to protect him			0
@entity139 convened , and in these last few days began a very thorough reform of the entire political system			0
on saturday the protesters gathered again in the hundreds of thousands to mourn their dead and to celebrate what they had achieved			0
@entity25 is now once again a parliamentary democracy , with presidential elections scheduled for may , and an alert population preserving the peace and watchful of its own newfound rights			1
what happened in @entity25 had little to do with the outside world			1
yet what happens next will			0
@entity25 's previous authorities were among the most corrupt imaginable			1
@entity32 's son , a dentist , earned at least $ 200 million in the last two years			2
@entity32 sat on a toilet of gold ( or two , actually ) in the extraordinary mansion he has had to abandon			2
the state , unsurprisingly , is close to bankruptcy			0
@entity60 has exercised influence in @entity25 by promising cash : the promise of 15 billion euros preceded the dictatorship laws , the promise of the release of a 2 billion tranche preceded the mass shootings			1
this sort of conditionality is what caused the revolution			2
something else is called for now			0
the @entity25 revolution took place without outside help			1
indeed , the men and women of the @entity35 , although they want their country inside the @entity181 , were extremely disappointed with @entity181 inaction during their revolution			1
now @entity181 financial aid will be needed to transform that revolution into stability			1
the @entity187 has promised loans , but this is not enough			0
people who risked death for the values we all claim to treasure , people who have brought a major nation back from dictatorship and to democracy deserve more than loans that will require immediate economic austerity			2
they need very significant @entity22 and @entity78 financial support			1
this could include loans , quick free trade negotiations , financial institutions that offer microcredits , and visa - free travel for normal @entity25 -- not just the billionaires			1
@entity25 oligarchs have parked hundreds of millions , if not billions , of dollars in @entity181 banks : some of it , just possibly , illegally			1
such accounts could be investigated promptly			0
direct financial assistance would have to be conditional upon further reforms that ensure the restoration and the preservation of the rule of law			2
this is not some idle choice			0
the @entity25 revolution , like any revolution , can fail			1
there are plenty of @entity25 who are confused by the revolution or oppose it , and are waiting to see what the new government will bring			1
although the @entity24 , the @entity78 , and @entity228 have recognized @entity25 's new authorities , @entity60 has not			1
@entity60 propaganda characterizes @entity25 activists ( depending on its purpose and intended audience ) as fascists , terrorists , or gays			1
prime minister @entity237 has claimed , without any evidence , that @entity60 citizens in @entity25 are under threat			1
that is the classical justification for intervention			0
@entity60 parliamentarians are now in @entity244 , promising @entity60 citizenship to ethnic @entity60 there and suggesting that @entity60 will support a referendum on the detachment of @entity244 from @entity25 and its attachment to @entity60			1
on the other side , among the revolutionaries are radicals who may not be satisfied by the compromises that end any revolution			2
their main motivation was the end of @entity87 's influence in @entity25 , and so they can be provoked			1
compromise will be possible in a state that is financially stable			0
in one that is not , @entity60 policy might provoke nationalists , and conflict can begin again			1
the cause of the @entity25 protesters was not to change the world , but only to change their world			2
what they wanted was normality , predictability , the ability to live their lives the way they chose			0
they wanted , in other words , the things that most of us take for granted			0
but now that their revolution has come , the world faces certain important choices			0
if we do n't understand the revolution in @entity25 , then we miss something special and unusual : a chance to support democracy .			1

@entity290 : we *'re* witnessing an extraordinary event , a revolution in @entity25
he says @entity25 's population did not run away from regime 's violence , but stood firm
*ukrainians* do n't want to accept a @entity60 - style regime in return for @entity60 money , he says
@entity290 : the @entity181 now must provide financial and other support for @entity25 's democracy
