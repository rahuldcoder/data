" oh no ! i did n't prepare anything ! " he said in genuine surprise			0
he proceeded to thank " everyone , " including , with a smirk , " everyone on my team			0
" but the @entity4 are known for their unexpected flourishes			0
after all , the awards do feature an open bar , and the attitude is often much looser in front of the 100 or so members of the @entity25 ( and the tv audience ) than the august @entity15 bigwigs at the @entity125			0
@entity126 disses estranged dad @entity128 's @entity4 tribute indeed , there were plenty of other talked - about moments : -- @entity132 finished her presentation of the @entity134 to @entity128 by singing a girl scout song in a childlike voice			1
-- a teleprompter malfunction led to presenters @entity138 and @entity140 reading their lines off a piece of paper			1
-- @entity144 , who won best supporting actress in a tv series , miniseries or tv movie for her performance in @entity150 's " @entity153 , " seemed breathless as she accepted the honor , staring at the camera for long seconds			1

best moments and gifs from the @entity4 @entity49 ' n ' @entity182 hosts @entity183 and @entity185 started the show by picking up where they left off last year			1
the pair immediately launched into jokes about the snubbed " @entity191 , " @entity192 and " gravity , " which was about how " @entity194 would rather float into space and die than spend another minute with a woman close to his own age			2
" they were particularly sharp about the often marginalized view of women in @entity201 : @entity63 losing 45 pounds for " @entity58 , " or " what actresses call ' being in a movie ' " ; @entity206 's nomination meaning there are still great roles for " @entity209 over 60			1
