calling the @entity2 and five of the major athletic conferences a " cartel , " an attorney representing four college athletes filed a class - action lawsuit against the @entity2 on monday , saying it was " illegally restraining competition for the services of players			1
" in short , college athletes should be paid , according to the landmark antitrust suit filed in a @entity14 , @entity15 , federal court			1
the @entity2 compensation cap allows universities to pay their football and basketball players only in the form of tuition , books , room and board and related fees , which monday 's complaint says is akin to a price - fixing agreement			1
attorney @entity29 , who is no stranger to taking on sports ' governing bodies , claims in the lawsuit that the schools are generating " billions of dollars in revenues each year through the hard work , sweat and sometimes broken bodies of top - tier college football and men 's basketball athletes			1
" " the reality is that it is already pro sports for everybody but the athletes , " @entity29 said , noting that the sports conferences negotiate lucrative television contracts and sponsorships , and universities shell out big bucks for coaches			1
in most states , a team coach is the highest paid state employee , the @entity52 - based attorney said			1
" what we are saying is that it is fundamentally unfair for there to be rules that prevent athletes who create all of this to receive nothing in return , " @entity29 said			1
are times changing ? @entity29 , who has handled several complex and high - profile antitrust cases , also litigated @entity66 v. the @entity67 , which led to the establishment of free agency in the @entity67 , and @entity70 v. @entity67 , which ended the 2011 @entity67 lockout			0
he also represented players in antitrust actions that led to the present free agency and salary cap systems in the @entity77			0
in monday 's lawsuit , @entity29 represents four plaintiffs : @entity81 football player @entity80 , @entity83 basketball player @entity82 , @entity85 football player @entity84 , who played his senior season in 2013 , and @entity88 football player @entity87 , who also played basketball for the @entity90 in 2011 and 2012			2
while only four plaintiffs are named , the class - action proposes representing all @entity93 players and all @entity93 basketball players			2
in addition to the @entity2 , the lawsuit -- which the @entity96 is backing -- also targets the so - called " power conferences " : the @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and @entity103			1
" ten years ago this discussion was completely different , " @entity96 president @entity104 said			0
" there were a lot of people defending the @entity2 system			1
fast - forward to today , very few people are defending the @entity2 and its practices			1
" this is n't the former @entity115 football player 's first foray into the issue			0
along with organizing the @entity118 wrist tape effort -- which seeks to end a system in which players " forfeit their rights and endure unnecessary physical , academic and financial risks as a condition of participating in @entity2 sports " -- @entity126 also founded the @entity127			1
the @entity127 supported @entity130 football players ' attempts to unionize			0
the players say they are university employees who are forced to put football first or risk losing free tuition			2
while monday 's lawsuit aims to end the old notion of amateurism in college sports and reverse @entity2 rules that forbid colleges from sharing with their players the billions of dollars made each year via their football and men 's basketball programs , the lawsuit does not guarantee salaries or eliminate scholarships			1
nor does it call for a trust fund or mention a stipend			0
it simply would give a university the option of paying the players it wants most			2
it also calls for individual damages for the player plaintiffs			2
" instead of permitting individual institutions to compete for the services of players who participate in their major college sports businesses , the @entity2 and the power conferences act as a cartel in placing a cap on the athletes ' compensation , " @entity29 said in a statement			1
" these restrictions are a blatant violation of antitrust laws , have no legitimate pro-competitive justification , and it is finally time to bring them to an end			0
" value in education the @entity2 contends that athletes are paid in the form of a free education , something that holds a lot of value both immediately and in the future			1
however , proponents of monday 's lawsuit point out that many student athletes never walk across the stage to get their diploma , and the percentage of @entity93 football and basketball players who make it to the @entity67 and @entity77 drafts is miniscule			1
in october , the @entity2 released a report saying that 82 % of @entity93 athletes who entered school in 2006 earned their degrees			1
the @entity2 lauded the graduation rates of two groups of student athletes , those playing for @entity93 teams and african - american @entity93 men 's basketball players , whom the report said graduated at rates of 71 % and 68 % , both records , according to the @entity2			1
a september report from the @entity210 - based @entity209 said student athlete graduation rates still hover well below those of the general student bodies			0
according to its " adjusted graduation gap " reports , players in the 10 conferences making up the @entity93 subdivision -- which includes the five conferences named in monday 's lawsuit -- graduated at a rate 18 % below the male student bodies of their schools			1
for black football players , the rate was 24 % below , the report said			0
the research institute 's basketball data from january 2013 also showed wide gaps , with male basketball players graduating at a rate 20 % below their male student bodies and female basketball players at a rate 9.2 % beneath that of their student bodies			0
if you consider only the top basketball conference , those rates jump to 30.1 % for men and 13.4 % for women , according to the institute 's findings			0
meanwhile , a joint study between @entity245 and @entity126 's organization found the fair market value of the average collegiate football player is about $ 120,000			0
it is $ 265,000 for the average men 's basketball player , the study said			0
the average scholarship , @entity126 said , is worth $ 23,000			0
" college athletes , they earn their way through school			2
this is not a gift			0
they put their bodies on the line , " @entity126 said			0
" i believe that amateurism is a myth			0
this is a multibillion dollar industry			0
... we 're not against that , but to exclude players from the spoils is un-american			0
it 's illegal , it 's inappropriate , and amateurism at this point is being used as a tool to strip the players of their fair market value			0
" not everyone thinks paying college players is a good idea			2
the topic has been debated for years by those within the world of college sport , and paying players has generally been opposed by college presidents , athletic directors and , of course , the @entity2			1
they all hang their hat on the education argument			0
at monday 's @entity294 meeting , former @entity67 commissioner @entity292 said paying athletes would be counterproductive and not in their best interests			1
some college athletes play like adults , read like 5th - graders does free market apply ? but @entity301 , a former consultant with the @entity2 on academic reform who is now an assistant professor at @entity304 in @entity305 , said offering compensation could have a positive impact on athletes ' educations			1
" if students are able to participate in the free market , it will allow us to decide what athletes are there for an education and what athletes are there for a minor league system and allow us to develop programs for each , " he said			2
the small percentage of athletes who play on full scholarship in the revenue - generating sports -- football and men 's basketball -- could be offered a salary as an incentive to play at a particular school , he said			2
but the rest of the student athletes , the majority of whom realistically will never be offered cash -- because most are n't even offered full scholarships -- could also benefit from a free market because it would open the door for endorsement deals , @entity333 said			2
" i really do not believe that paying student athletes will have a negative impact on their education , " @entity333 said			1
" it will have a positive impact			0
" @entity126 and @entity29 said they believe public opinion is shifting their way			0
they acknowledge that a few years ago , it would have been less likely to find current players willing to put their names on a lawsuit like this			2
but as former @entity2 basketball player @entity363 's lawsuit -- which he filed to take back the rights to his own name and likeness from the @entity2 -- has moved through the courts , public opinion on the matter of athlete compensation is shifting , they said			1
in recent years , prominent coaches like the @entity210 's football coach , @entity369 , have come out in favor of paying players , while @entity29 's legal team even has a convert , @entity373 , a former @entity2 lead investigator who is now playing for the other side			1
whether the sports - loving public is ready to hop aboard the bandwagon is another story			0
a @entity379 for @entity381 poll conducted in 2012 showed that about two - thirds of sports fans , college football fans and college basketball fans concurred that a scholarship for top players was sufficient			0
but when @entity389 asked a similar question in 2007 , the number was much higher , with 78 % of those responding saying college athletes should not be paid salaries .			2
