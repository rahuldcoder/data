-- i am a mother of three , and my views on guns have evolved significantly over the course of my lifetime			2
my husband hunts and believes strongly in his right to bear arms			2
but when my 25 - year - old son , @entity9 , shot himself in a moment of despair in april 2012 , i came full circle to a harsh reality : there are almost twice as many suicides as murders by firearm across @entity18 , roughly 19,000 of the 30,000 gun deaths each year			1
yet we disproportionately fear and almost exclusively talk of criminals in the national gun debate			1
my introduction to guns came on a hot summer day in 1963			2
my father , 53 , sent us all out of the house to have an afternoon of fun at a swimming pool			1
he called police , wrote " i 'm sorry " on a scrap of paper , and shot himself in our basement			1
my dad had recently lost his job			1
not knowing how he would support his family , he had calculated how much his life insurance policies would pay upon his death			2
it was enough for my mother to raise the five of us , between the ages of 5 and 15 at the time			2
related : a mother 's journey to bearing arms i vividly recall the carefree joy of that day in the sun , which was shattered by numbness , confusion , shock , grief and shame			2
the world felt much less safe from that day on			1
fifteen years later , i became a naval officer to support myself and so i would never be a financial burden on anyone			1
i qualified as a marksman on an m - 16 rifle , felt the kick of firing a .45 - caliber handgun and visited the pistol range many times to shoot a friend 's .38 - caliber revolver			1
i was not afraid of guns			2
when my sons were still small , i got rid of my handgun because i was more afraid for them than for myself			0
i recalled my co-worker 's experience : her son 's friend was accidentally shot in her garage when another youngster brought a gun over , unbeknownst to any adults			1
marine to senator : i wo n't ' register my weapons ' all three of my smart , athletic sons grew up to graduate from college and find good - paying jobs			0
in the summer of 2011 , my middle son bought a house just outside of @entity85 with his then - girlfriend of five years			1
as he often did , @entity9 followed his older brother 's lead , buying a handgun for protection and target shooting			0
he developed a fascination with weapons and bought a rifle and a sword , too , all " tools " designed to kill			0
when @entity9 proudly showed me his new handgun , i spoke to him about my father 's suicide by gun almost 50 years earlier -- the pain and sorrow it caused and the fear for him it now raised in me			1
i advised him that numerous , reliable studies showed that his gun was more likely to be used against a member of his own household than on anyone else			1
he expressed surprise at this information			0
having said my piece , i dismissed my fears , satisfied that " forewarned is forearmed			0
" ten months later , i knew @entity9 was unhappy with his job , but none of us close to him ever imagined he was so despondent			0
he called in sick to work one friday , wrote me and his fiancee notes of love and apology , walked to the woods , called police and shot himself in the head			1
he left his driver 's license with its red heart for organ donation next to him			0
a dozen people received his last gifts , half of which saved lives			0
our love affair with guns in this country needs to be tempered with a healthy dose of respect for all the dangers of ownership			1
i support the right of individuals to make informed decisions about whether and how to keep a gun in their house			1
parents defend right to keep guns in the home given the number of guns already out there , alerting owners to the heightened risks and steps to reduce those risks seems wiser than speaking of getting rid of them			0
that just throws up a furious wall of opposition from gun owners			1
determined to spare other parents this horrific experience , i have studied much of the research related to suicide and firearms			1
it 's a myth that without a gun handy , people bent on killing themselves will just find another way			1
for many , the suicidal crisis is temporary , and 90 % of those who survive an attempt do not go on to die by suicide			1
any obstacle or delay can break the self - destructive trance			0
guns are extremely lethal as a means of suicide			1
very few survive a self - inflicted gunshot wound to get a second chance at life			0
protecting your family from this risk means getting rid of or locking up your guns			0
having a gun in your home at least doubles the risk of suicide for all who live there			1
gun safes , trigger locks and separate ammo storage can reduce , but not eliminate , that increased risk			1
think twice about giving adolescents or any troubled family member unsupervised access to deadly weapons , no matter how much safety training they 've had			0
mental health treatment has not made a dent in suicide statistics , but reducing access to the most lethal methods can drastically lower overall suicide and murder rates			2
many of us face moments of overwhelming despair , whether mentally ill or not			0
the vast majority of us get past these dark thoughts and learn to cope with the trials of life			0
though guns lack intent , they are suggestive of death			0
the mere presence of this most lethal tool actually influences the suicidal person 's decision by making death too easy , quick and certain			0
my hope is that people will recognize the very real threat of suicide , know that it is preventable , and act to keep guns out of reach			2
if you suspect that anyone in your family might be suffering from depression or suicidal thoughts , please get the gun out of the house or change the combination or the key before it 's too late			2
