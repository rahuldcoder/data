the debate over a link between autism and vaccines continues			1
a study published earlier this month concluded @entity7 - @entity6 boys are more at risk for autism if they 're given the measles , mumps and rubella vaccine before the age of 2			1
the study author says researchers at the @entity16 knew about the link in 2004 -- and covered it up			1
@entity16 researchers are standing by their original findings : that there is no link between autism and vaccination schedules			1
the new study was funded by the @entity27 , which says it is dedicated to exposing the causes of autism , " focusing on the role of vaccinations			1
" the study has since been removed from the public domain pending further investigation , according to @entity35			2
in an online statement , the scientific journal said the paper had been removed " because of serious concerns about the validity of its conclusions			1
" @entity43 first became aware of the study when an @entity45 was posted about its publication and the controversy surrounding it			2
@entity45 is @entity43 's user - generated news community			0
@entity49 , author of the study and a biochemical engineer , found @entity7 - @entity6 boys who were given the @entity53 vaccine before age 24 months were more likely to be diagnosed with autism			1
to reach this conclusion , @entity49 said he analyzed the same set of data that was the basis for a 2004 study done by researchers at the @entity16			1
in 2004 , scientists at the @entity16 's @entity61 published their study in the journal @entity64			1
researchers compared 624 children with autism , age 3 to 10 , with 1,824 developmentally healthy children			2
most of the children , according to the study , were vaccinated between 12 and 17 months of age in accordance with vaccination recommendations			2
the @entity16 study authors found no link between the age children were given their first @entity53 vaccination and autism diagnoses			1
nor did they find a statistically significant increased risk for a particular racial group			0
the @entity16 's raw data was made available for other scientists to use when its study was published in 2004			1
@entity49 said he began his research after he was contacted by one of the original study authors , @entity87 , in november 2013			2
@entity87 is a senior scientist with the @entity16 , where he has worked since 1998			1
@entity49 said he believes the increased risk for @entity6 boys he found was not identified in the @entity16 study because the researchers , including @entity87 , deliberately limited the number of participants they included in their analysis , which he said altered the results			1
@entity49 said that by excluding children without birth certificates , the @entity16 study results were skewed			1
" i regret that my co-authors and i omitted statistically significant information in our 2004 article , " @entity87 said in a statement sent to @entity43 by his lawyer			2
" i have had many discussions with dr. @entity49 over the last 10 months regarding studies the @entity16 has carried out regarding vaccines and neurodevelopmental outcomes , including autism spectrum disorders			1
i share his belief that @entity16 decision - making and analyses should be transparent			2
" however , @entity87 went on to say that @entity49 had recorded these conversations without his consent , and had posted them online without his knowledge			0
in a statement to @entity43 on monday , the @entity16 said its study presented results for two sets of children : all children initially recruited for the study , and a subset of children for whom a @entity125 birth certificate was available			1
" access to the information on the birth certificates allowed researchers to assess more complete information on race , as well as other important characteristics , " the @entity16 statement said			2
dr. @entity137 , lead author of the 2004 study , said he and his colleagues stand by their findings			1
@entity137 said all the study authors , including @entity87 , agreed on the analysis and interpretation before the study was submitted for publication 10 years ago			2
however , he said he plans to review his notes and will decide whether to run another analysis on the data			0
the new study by @entity49 has been publicized by groups like @entity27 , which say vaccines have contributed to the " current autism epidemic and rise of chronic illness in children			1
" @entity49 is a scientific adviser for the @entity27			0
he also has a 16 - year - old son with developmental delays who he said is " vaccine injured			0
" dr. @entity160 , a pediatric neurologist at @entity161 in @entity162 , said the design of @entity49 's study is questionable , and that his analysis is " not fine - tuned enough to give you meaningful information			0
" " if you analyze data enough times and enough ways , you 're bound to find something that is statistically significant , " said @entity168 , after looking at both studies			0
" this does not mean that the result is a true positive ( vs. a false positive ) or meaningful			0
" the debate over whether autism spectrum disorders are caused by vaccines started when researcher @entity181 published a now - retracted study in @entity183 in 1998 that linked the @entity53 vaccine to autism			1
most of @entity181 's co-authors withdrew their names from the study when they learned @entity181 had been compensated by a law firm intending to sue manufacturers of the vaccine in question			0
in 2010 , @entity181 lost his medical license			0
and in 2011 , @entity183 retracted the study after an investigation found @entity181 altered or misrepresented information on the 12 children who were the basis for the conclusion of his study			0
other researchers have not been able to replicate @entity181 's findings			0
in fact , several subsequent studies trying to reproduce the results have found no link between vaccines and autism , including several reviews by the @entity213			1
most recently , a study published in @entity64 on july 1 concluded that vaccines do not cause autism spectrum disorders			1
an editorial published with the @entity64 study added that the debate should be put to rest			2
this review was done by the @entity222 at the request of the @entity224 , and claims to be the most comprehensive review on the safety of vaccines			0
" i want to be absolutely clear that i believe vaccines have saved and continue to save countless lives , " @entity87 said in his statement			0
" i would never suggest that any parent avoid vaccinating children of any race			0
" while the cause of autism is not known , several studies indicate it starts in utero , long before a child is given the @entity53 or any other vaccinations			0
as such , @entity137 and other experts in the field have said it is biologically implausible for vaccines to cause autism			2
" we know the brain and cellular features for children begin when the child is still in the womb			0
the brain is already developing the wiring that will manifest in autism , " @entity137 said			0
@entity49 said his results raise more questions than answers and pointed to the need for additional studies			0
the advocacy group @entity259 , which declined to comment on @entity49 's study , referred @entity43 to its " @entity262 " statement , which says : " we strongly encourage parents to have their children vaccinated for protection against serious disease			0
we recognize that some parents still have concerns about vaccines , particularly if they have a child or relative with autism			1
we urge them to find a health practitioner who will consider their concerns and help them ensure the well - being of their child			0
