@entity0 , @entity1 -- the petite 25 - year - old tentatively opens the door to the hotel room where we 've agreed to meet			1
her face is covered , but her body language betrays her anxiety			2
she slowly lifts her niqab , revealing her young , heart - shaped face			1
her large brown eyes , filled with guilt and turmoil , are delicately made up under perfectly sculpted brows			2
she calls herself ' @entity16			2
' it 's not her real name , because she 's a marked woman			2
once a member of a fearsome , female @entity21 brigade , she 's a recent defector , disillusioned by the group 's brutality			1
her interview with @entity2 is the first time she has ever told anyone her story			2
' i ran away to something uglier ' growing up in @entity31 , @entity16 's family ensured she got an education			1
she earned her college degree and began teaching elementary school			2
@entity16 describes her family and upbringing as " not overly conservative			2
" when the @entity31 uprising began more than three and a half years ago , @entity16 joined the masses who began peaceful protests against the government of president @entity42			1
" we 'd go out and demonstrate			2
the security services would chase us			2
we 'd write on walls , have different outfits to change into , " she said			2
" those days were great			2
" but it was when the @entity31 uprising spiraled into chaos and violence that she said she began to lose her soul , her humanity			1
" everything around us was chaos , " she said , her words tumbling out			1
" @entity57 , the regime , barrel bombs , strikes , the wounded , clinics , blood -- you want to tear yourself away , to find something to run to			2
" my problem was i ran away to something uglier			2
" gradual induction she found herself drawn to the eloquence of a @entity68 whom she met online			1
taken with his manners , she grew to trust him over time and he gradually lured her into the @entity74 , she said			1
he assured her that the group was not what people thought , that it was not a terrorist organization			2
" he would say , ' we are going to properly implement @entity80			2
right now we are in a state of war , a phase where we need to control the country , so we have to be harsh			2
' " he told her he was coming to the @entity31 city of @entity87 , that they could even get married			1
" i got in touch with my cousin , and she said , ' you can come join us in the @entity92			0
she was living in @entity87 with her husband who was with the @entity74 , " @entity16 said			0
the brigade is the feared , all - female police for @entity21			1
@entity16 convinced her family to move to @entity87 , saying it would be easier to register her younger siblings in school , and that they would have the support of relatives			0
with her cousin to open the doors , @entity16 was welcomed into the feared @entity105 brigade			1
inside the female @entity21 brigade the @entity92 is made up of around 25 to 30 women and is tasked with patrolling the streets of @entity87 to ensure that women adhere to proper clothing as outlined by the @entity74			1
beaded or slightly form - fitting abayas are banned			1
women are not allowed to show their eyes			1
those who broke the laws are lashed			0
the lashings to the women who broke @entity21 rules were carried out by @entity118			1
when @entity16 first saw @entity118 , she was terrified			0
" she 's not a normal female			1
she 's huge , she has an @entity121 , a pistol , a whip , a dagger and she wears the niqab , " @entity16 said			0
brigade commander @entity126 sensed @entity16 's fear " and she got close to me and said a sentence i wo n't forget			1
she said , ' we are harsh with the infidels , but merciful among ourselves			0
' " @entity16 was trained to clean , dismantle , and fire a weapon			0
she was paid $ 200 a month and received food rations			0
her family sensed @entity134 was slipping away , but were helpless to stop it			0
her mother tried to warn her			0
" she would always say to me , ' @entity138 , take care of yourself			0
you are walking , but you do n't know where you are going			0
' " @entity143 's first female fighter pilot led airstrike against @entity21 second thoughts initally , @entity16 did not pay attention to her mother 's warnings , seduced by the sense of power			1
but eventually , she started questioning herself and the principles of the @entity74			0
" at the start , i was happy with my job			0
i felt that i had authority in the streets			0
but then i started to get scared , scared of my situation			0
i even started to be afraid of myself			0
" she started thinking : " i am not like this			0
i have a degree in education			0
i should n't be like this			0
what happened to me ? what happened in my mind that brought me here ? " and her image of @entity21 began to crumble			1
burned into her mind is an image she saw online of a 16 - year - old boy who was crucified for rape			1
she questioned her inclusion in a group capable of such violence			1
" the worst thing i saw was a man getting his head hacked off in front of me , " she said			1
violence against women even more personally , she witnessed @entity21 ' brand of violence reserved for women			1
the brigade shared its building with a man who specialized in marriage for @entity21 fighters			1
" he was one of the worst people , " she said of the man tasked with finding wives for both local and foreign fighters			1
" the foreign fighters are very brutal with women , even the ones they marry , " she said			1
" there were cases where the wife had to be taken to the emergency ward because of the violence , the sexual violence			1
" @entity16 saw a future she did not want			0
with her commander pressuring her to submit to marriage , @entity16 decided she needed to leave the brigade			2
" so it was at this point , i said enough			0
after all that i had already seen and all the times i stayed silent , telling myself , ' we 're at war , then it will all be rectified			0
' " but after this , i decided no , i have to leave			0
" @entity16 left just days before the coalition airstrikes , but her family remains in @entity31			1
she was smuggled across the border to @entity1			0
inside the online world of the women of @entity21 life after @entity21 @entity16 still wears the niqab , not just to conceal her identity but also because she 's struggling to adapt back to life outside the @entity74			1
regretful of her immersion in radical @entity80 , she is wary of another sudden change			0
" it has to be gradual , so that i do n't become someone else			0
i am afraid of becoming someone else			0
someone who swings , as a reaction in the other direction , after i was so entrenched in religion , that i reject religion completely , " she said			0
towards the end of our interview , speaking about how @entity21 could have gotten a foothold in parts of @entity31 society , she has a personal moment			1
" how did we allow them to come in ? how did we allow them to rule us ? there is a weakness in us			0
" @entity16 spoke to us because she said she wants people , especially women , to know the truth about @entity21			1
" i do n't want anyone else to be duped by them			0
too many girls think they are the right @entity80 , " she said			0
she desperately wants to be the girl she was before falling under the spell of @entity21 -- " a girl who is merry , who loves life and laughter ... who loves to travel , to draw , to walk in the street with her headphones listening to music without caring what anyone thinks , " she said			1
" i want to be like that again			0
