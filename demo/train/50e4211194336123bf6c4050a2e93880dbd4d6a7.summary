the sausage -- it 's nothing more than minced meat slipped into a cylindrical skin , perfect for breakfasts , barbecues or snacking at a sporting event			1
or is it ? across @entity9 , one hears tales of the dark side of the sausage : under - the - counter items talked of in whispers			1
these are the sausages no one speaks of in polite society			0
sausages that could strike fear , as well as saturated fat , into the heart of even the hardiest hog fan			0
@entity9 has more than its fair share of sausages that time forgot			1
here are some of the best or , depending on your attitude toward offal , worst			0
@entity30 a traditional @entity32 sausage lovingly made from strips of swine intestine rolled - up and wrapped in the pig 's colon -- known in the food trade as chitterlings -- the andouillette has an easily identifiable aroma of decay			1
the sausage is a specialty of the @entity45 region and yes , there is a certain irony in the world 's glitziest wine being combined with the world 's least - glamorous sausage			1
legend has it that the andouillette can trace its origins to the @entity56 , and it certainly smells like it			0
the andouillette should be made by hand so , like snowflakes , no two are the same			2
also like snowflakes , they can be eaten cold , but hot is preferred to get the full effect of the smell			0
snag it : charcuterie @entity66 , 3 place general @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 ; +33 386 42 10 62 @entity71 @entity73 's top chefs may try to pass it off as haute cuisine , but there 's no escaping the fact that the country 's most famous dish -- haggis -- is just a big sausage , albeit one filled with mutton rather than pork			1
to make it , sheep heart , lungs and liver are all blended together with oatmeal and packaged up in a sheep 's stomach to be slowly simmered into submission			1
onion and spices give it a bit of a kick and it 's often served in combination with " neeps and tatties " -- mashed swedes and potatoes			2
it 's not every sausage that gets celebrated in verse			1
@entity73 national poet @entity105 hailed the haggis as " great chieftain o the puddin ' - race			2
" other sausages should take note			0
snag it : @entity112 , @entity113 , 267 @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 ; +44 131 558 8737 @entity117 this delicacy from @entity119 and @entity120 in southwest @entity121 takes something porkers have in abundance -- fat -- and makes an entire meal out of it			0
hog fat blended with oatmeal , suet and barley is somewhat on the bland side , but the addition of handfuls of cumin and garlic means there is some flavor			2
not scary enough ? wait until it 's time to cook			2
this grease beast spits like a camel and cooks will need to dress like firefighters to stay safe when frying -- or risk the whole thing exploding in the oven if baked			0
snag it : @entity147 and @entity148 , 7 @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity119 , @entity116 ; +44 1647 432461 @entity151 with more than 1,500 varieties , no one could accuse @entity154 of shirking its sausage duties			1
inevitably some of these are " acquired tastes			0
" among them is a form of " head cheese " known as @entity151 , or blood tongue			1
head cheese has nothing to do with milk , but is a terrine made from anything north of an animal 's neck -- in this case the pickled tongue of a pig or cow			1
@entity151 is , in fact , a mix of blood , tongue , bread crumbs and oatmeal			1
the brown - black sausage is cured so it can be eaten cold but is usually sliced and then fried in a little butter			1
snag it : straight from the farm			0
@entity184 in the @entity186 village of @entity187 slaughters the animals and makes the sausage on the spot ; +49 9923 2240 @entity191 the " botifarra " variety of this @entity194 sausage uses parts of the pig lesser sausages leave behind			2
ears , snout , the head itself -- nothing is wasted			0
they are prepared and cooked in the home during pig - slaughtering season -- yes there 's a pig slaughtering season -- from december to february			1
the @entity209 is a local adaptation of a sausage hauled into the region by @entity212 in the 19th century			2
snag it : @entity215 butchers , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 ; +351 266 703 177 @entity219 watched " @entity222 " and thought , " yes , i see the attraction ? " there 's a sausage for that			2
blood sausage comes in many forms throughout @entity9			1
this northern @entity229 version blends pig 's blood with rice and seasoning such as oregano , salt , pepper and paprika			1
lard binds it and onion bulks it out and , if you 're lucky , it 'll be served in cow tripe skin			0
after boiling , it is usually eaten in thin fried slices			0
it 's characteristically brown , rather than black			1
snag it : @entity248 , @entity219 , @entity229 ; +34 947 20 90 52 @entity250 @entity249 what could make blood sausage more -- or , indeed , less -- appealing ? how about sugar ? @entity250 blodpolse includes the red stuff , but also milk , sugar , raisins and cardamon , all lovingly bound together with suet			2
this sweetened version is n't aimed at fooling kids into eating offal			0
in fact , there is an interesting historical reason for the invention of sweet blood pudding -- in the past sugar was not merely a sweetener , but a flavor enhancer , so by including sugar you could really enjoy the blood			0
@entity273 is usually dished up with stewed apples , butter cinnamon and syrup			0
it 's like all the courses of a meal in a single skin			0
who could resist ? snag it : buy online from @entity250 retailer @entity283 ; +45 7452 36 24 or , if you speak @entity250 , want to make your own and have a very strong stomach , there 's a video showing you how : @entity288			0
