@entity0 , @entity1 -- they 're lonely and hungry , condemned to a life of daily hardship with little to hope for			1
deprived of food , wearing old clothes , countless homeless children are living on the dusty streets of @entity0 , the lakeside capital of @entity1 , victims of a bloody civil war that wreaked havoc on the tiny east @entity14 country			1
scared and neglected , the children 's lives are fraught with great danger ; some of them suffer from abuse while others resort to a life of crime to survive , earning the name " kirobezo , " which means bad child			2
but not everyone sees them like that			0
one woman is responding to these young children not with anger but with love -- and a whole lot of food			1
affectionately known as " @entity35 , " which means " mama sunday , " @entity1 radio presenter and longtime children 's advocate @entity38 has made it her duty to feed as many homeless street kids as possible			1
every single week , she opens her house on sundays , providing free meals to @entity0 's vulnerable youngsters			0
" street children do not get enough to eat , they can spend two days without eating , " says @entity38			1
" they do n't have clothes and mostly they are not loved -- they are hopeless that 's why we find them joining armed groups , " she continues			0
" they can steal , they can rob , they can kill , " she says			0
" they can do any bad thing , living that kind of life , i hate it			0
that 's why i invite them every sunday -- so that we can share food and have a time to discuss			2

instead , everyone is made to feel welcome			0
before the meal , one teenager says a prayer for the group and then @entity38 hands out large bowls full of flavorful beans and rice			1
she pays out of her own pocket and , at one point , she even went into debt in order to feed and provide for these children			2
civil war @entity1 is one of the smallest countries in @entity86 and one of the poorest in the world			2
it gained independence from @entity91 in 1962 , but after years of tension and coups it descended into a vicious civil war that lasted from 1993 to 2005			0
the armed conflict left hundreds of thousands dead and many more displaced			0
everyone in the country suffered in some way because of the war , but especially children			2
half of @entity1 's population is under the age of 18 , while an estimated half a million children were orphaned by the civil war and @entity107 , with many of them living on the streets			1
read this : from the streets to break beats nearly 60 % of @entity1 's children under five suffer from malnutrition , a primary factor behind their desperation and move toward crime , according to @entity38			1
" i have children who are in prison because they have stolen and they do it to get something to eat , " she says			0
" that 's why i do my best to protect them so that they do n't end up in prison or in armed groups -- they go because they are without hope			0
" giving children a voice @entity38 , 58 , has been an outspoken advocate for @entity1 's children for several decades now			1
back in the late 1970s she began working at the only radio station in the country			0
after realizing how conflict was pushing children into violent crime , she decided to give them a voice by creating a show about young people and possibly convince them of a better life			1
during the war , when thousands of people were displaced to refugee camps in neighboring countries , @entity38 used her radio program " @entity147 " -- or " speaking with children " -- to comfort those fleeing to @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			1
today she still invites a selection of homeless children to join her on her program and discuss anything they want			1
the more fortunate ones speak about the importance of an education , children 's rights and mutual support for one another			0
kids can even call in and ask anything they want			0
amongst those participating are @entity38 's success stories -- young people like @entity169 , a 17 - year - old boy who is doing his best in high school , for which @entity38 is paying			2
" there are many good stories , " says @entity38			2
" there are many children who have succeeded ; there is a story of one child whose job was to steal -- he was caught and put into prison but now he 's an artist , a singer ; there is another one who now is taking care of other street children -- he has an education center ; there is another one who is now in @entity189 ; another one is in @entity86			1
there are many stories that make me happy			0
" it 's because of all this work that the @entity196 embassy in @entity197 decided in march to honor @entity38 by naming her the 2013 " @entity200 " for exemplifying strength and leadership			1
" she is a generous , warm person who has committed her life to the betterment of children without asking for anything in return , " @entity196 ambassador @entity201 said at the time			1
since the award some small donations have started rolling in , but @entity38 says she 's not worried about finances			1
" the riches i have are in my heart , " she says			0
" you can have a lot of ( material ) things , but not help anyone -- the best riches are in the heart			0
" @entity38 says what motivates her are the children who 've grown up , avoided violence and improved their lives			1
" i say that the young people are the @entity1 for tomorrow , but tomorrow is impossible if we do n't live well today , " she says			2
" tomorrow starts today , that 's why we hug the children so that they can feel loved and never go back to do bad things			0
