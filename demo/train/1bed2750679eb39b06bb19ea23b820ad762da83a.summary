@entity0 , @entity1 -- just a year before turning 40 , @entity3 was diagnosed with an aggressive form of breast cancer that required an immediate mastectomy			1
the procedure and the treatments that followed left her fatigued , nauseated and in so much pain that she could n't pick up her 1 - year - old daughter or do simple household chores			2
she also struggled with depression because she needed constant child - care assistance			2
" it 's really hard to ask for help , " @entity3 recalled			2
" you want to be competent and independent			2
... and then , all of a sudden , you have to acknowledge the fact that you ca n't take care of your daughter all by yourself			2
" @entity3 and her husband were both full - time students , so there were also financial concerns			2
the couple cashed in their retirement to deal with the crush of medical bills			2
" i was really bottoming out emotionally , " @entity3 said			2
that 's when a friend recommended that she reach out to the @entity32 , a nonprofit that provides support to breast cancer patients under 45			1
since 2008 , the @entity32 has helped more than 150 women -- mostly in the form of house - cleaning assistance and gift cards for gas , groceries and restaurants			1
but according to @entity3 , it 's so much more			0
" it 's hope , " she said			0
" right when i would hit the ( emotional ) low , there was a gift card ... or the toilet was ' magically ' clean			0
i ca n't overemphasize the value of that to somebody with cancer			1
" the founder of the @entity32 , @entity50 , can relate to @entity3 's plight			1
she was 41 when she was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2006			1
" i could not even wrap my head around it , " @entity50 said			1
" you 're relatively healthy , and they tell you ( that ) you have a chance of dying			0
... it just throws your world upside down			0
" @entity50 underwent surgery to remove both breasts and 20 lymph nodes			1
she received eight rounds of chemotherapy and 37 radiation treatments before undergoing breast reconstruction surgery			2
she blistered , bled , lost all her hair and continued to work full - time as a copywriter and the sole provider for her husband and two young children			2
throughout her treatment , however , @entity50 was supported by family , friends and co-workers who pitched in to help her with her daily responsibilities			1
co-workers donated vacation and sick leave			0
friends brought over meals and took on child - care duties			0
relatives helped with mounting costs			0
" i just felt so grateful that all these people in my life were there for me and made it manageable , " she said			0
" once i was through with treatment , i could n't possibly pay everybody back			0
so i decided i was going to pay it forward			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity96 through her ordeal , @entity50 met other young breast cancer patients who were struggling through their treatment but lacked the kind of support that she had			1
she found that many breast cancer foundations exist primarily to raise awareness and funding for research and treatment , not to offset the daily stress on patients ' lives			1
" i 'm all for research ; i hope my daughter never has to go through this , " @entity50 said			1
" but the @entity32 's biggest concern is helping the ( young ) women that ca n't wait for a cure			1
... they 're sick right now , and they need help today			0
" @entity50 fields grant requests through her website			1
the grants average $ 400 in value and are designed to cover a woman 's basic needs for about one month , but @entity50 will customize the level and type of support based on need and available resources			1
the money comes from small fundraisers and personal donations			0
" right now , the @entity32 is helping women in these small ways , " @entity50 said			1
" but eventually , i want to be able to help in larger ways with real practical , tangible things like helping with bills ... helping with the rent , helping with medical payments			0
it 's so hard to focus on healing when you 've got $ 12,000 in medical bills			0
" the average age of women diagnosed with breast cancer in the @entity145 is 61			1
but according to the @entity147 , there are more than 250,000 women living in the @entity145 who were 40 or younger when diagnosed			2
" i think it 's harder when you 're younger , " @entity50 said , " because you 're a mom , or you 're a college student , or you 're working			1
you normally felt really good			0
and suddenly , you feel terrible all the time			0
" @entity50 said older women also tend to have a larger support system			1
" older women sometimes have grown children to help or a retired husband , or their friends do n't work , " she said			0
" plus , there 's a lot of senior services and @entity159 and disability and @entity161 that , younger women , we often just do n't have			2
" in addition to providing young breast cancer patients with immediate assistance , the @entity32 has built an online community that connects them and offers emotional support during what can be a potentially isolating time			1
" i feel like they 're my sisters , and i just want to do whatever i can to help them , " @entity50 said			1
" i cry a lot			0
i always light a candle when i lose somebody i 've helped			0
... it 's unbelievable and heart - wrenching , but it 's just part of the job			0
... " i 'll probably die of breast cancer someday			1
but i do n't feel sorry for myself			0
i want to really make the most of the time i have by doing some good in the world			0
... and if the spirit of helping each other were to continue , i 'd feel my efforts meant something			0
