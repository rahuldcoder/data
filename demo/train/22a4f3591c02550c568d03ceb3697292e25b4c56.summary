-- i keep my hands hovering in the space between an elevated lamp and a square white box that resembles a washing machine			0
at a signal , i make patterns with my hands , creating shadows that stretch out on the bright surface below , generating a cacophony of barking , as if a pack of dogs have been released into the @entity16 basement			0
this is a meeting of the city 's @entity18 , an offshoot of the @entity21 , among the largest of over 1,000 such citizen workshops that populate the world from @entity24 to @entity25			1
around a dozen keen members -- and 150 part - time - form the basis of this music chapter ; designing , building and re-purposing instruments to suit ambitious creative projects			1
the ' washing machine ' is one of eight home - made instruments the members have created that make up the ' @entity37 ' , an installation inspired by prehistoric musical collaboration , which has exhibited in some of @entity16 's leading cultural institutions including the @entity41 and @entity42			1
three of the instruments respond to physical movement , and another is activated by light			1
one produces sound through an accelerometer and gyroscope , and there is a sensor - filled hat operated by taps from a metallic glove			2
trained percussionist and hackspace member @entity55 believes a new style of instrument is emerging from maker culture			1
" the technology lowers the bar to participation , so it 's easier to create with it			2
but the music may be more ephemeral than lasting -- there 's a parallel to early jazz when it was very free and experimental			1
" musical legacy but @entity55 believes that there may be a lasting impact from instruments that interact with the listener			2
" future generations might think it 's wacky to listen to the same song over and over again			2
" the collective have already made waves through @entity80 , a radically re-imagined keyboard , launched by @entity16 start - up @entity82 with the work of several members			1
the instrument uses tactile sensations to create a more nuanced experience , allowing the user greater control of the volume , pitch , and timbre emanating from its rubber keys			2
the @entity80 has heavyweight support from the likes of @entity97 , who demonstrated its use , and is now a shareholder			0
" evolution can be more responsive versions of existing instruments " , says @entity101 , @entity82 innovation manager and hackspace organizer			1
" digital music offers so much range and possibility but misses the familiarity of physical objects in your hand			2
your body has so much expressive ability , so i think the future is combining the two			0
" this mode for innovation has been popular			0
the semi-finalists in @entity121 's prestigious musical instrument competition ' included @entity123 's augmented trombone , complete with amplification and wireless sensors , and the @entity126 that gives the woodwind staple a range of effects and data capture			1
digital analogue a contrasting approach has been to make computers behave like traditional instruments , as pioneered by @entity136 band @entity135			2
the musicians play heavily customized @entity138 , using touch screen interfaces , wireless sensing and a range of apps such as virtual instrument platform ' @entity144 ' to give performances along with the sound			2
" i play very differently when there is touch " , says band member @entity147 , comparing with his background in electronic music production			0
" it feels like a real instrument rather than technology			0
you 're more physically involved , you can bend and distort notes , and affect the sound more			0
" @entity147 believes it 's a method accessible to any beginner " if they have a good ear " , and sees potential for large - scale , networked collaborations			1
hobbyists have already shown the potential with a reworking of the " @entity168 " theme , while the @entity169 have delivered a symphony on @entity171			0
emerging instruments can be even more available and adaptable than our smartphones			0
the ' @entity175 ' from @entity16 start - up @entity176 is a pocket - sized synthesizer that can turn any everyday object - from vegetables to furniture - into an instrument if the two are connected with simple cables			1
the user can then compose using the synthesizer 's inputs and the object 's own conductive properties ( see video below			1

noisy shirt a similar system has been adapted to create wearable instruments , as with the percussion jackets worn by @entity197 participant @entity195 , and even edible instruments , through ice - cream activated by the player 's tongue			1
analysts see a collective spirit as a common thread running through innovation in hacked instruments			0
" it 's partly about using technology to make people interact " , says @entity207 , head of development , digital and communications at @entity210 , the @entity136 agency for new music			1
" anyone can play but typically it needs to be with others			0
" @entity207 believes such home - made instruments could have a broad appeal beyond the maker niche and be widely taken up by children , although as an accompaniment rather than a replacement for traditional instruments			1
" musicians that do one would do the other			0
" the analyst is most excited about " music generated by interaction with living things " , and some epic projects have illustrated the potential of using the environment as an instrument			1
" @entity247 " is the result of two artists laboriously mapping a @entity136 forest over two years and creating a musical motif for each organism , a database which is then installed at the site so that the forest effectively plays - and interacts with - its own symphony			0
in 2013 , @entity249 composer @entity248 used thousands of crowd - sourced sound elements from the city of @entity252 , drawing on everything from elevator conversation to overhead planes , to create a soundscape for the city 's festival			1
the richness of audio data available from the environment also offers spectacular performance possibilities , to give the audience immersive , multi-sensory experiences			0
the classical virtuosos are not endangered yet , but regular concerts and instruments could begin to seem outdated before long			0
read more from @entity268 , @entity269 : forget wearable tech , embeddable implants are already here feeling glum , happy , aroused ? new technology can detect your mood forget text messaging , the ' @entity277 ' lets you send smells			0
