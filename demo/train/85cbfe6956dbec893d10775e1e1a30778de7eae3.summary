-- a giant panda slated to be the star of the first - ever live broadcast of the birth of panda cubs has lost the role -- after it was discovered the bear is not pregnant after all , @entity9 state media reported			1
not only was it a phantom pregnancy , but zookeepers suspect the panda , @entity14 , may have been faking it to improve her quality of life , the @entity10 told @entity16 on monday			1
@entity14 , age 6 , had shown signs of pregnancy , including a change in appetite , moving less and an increase in progestational hormone in july , according to @entity16			1
but after almost two months , she began acting normally again , zookeepers said			0
experts say pandas sometimes carry on the behaviors associated with early pregnancy after noticing that they get preferential treatment , the news agency reported			1
" after showing prenatal signs , the ' mothers - to - be ' are moved into single rooms with air conditioning and around - the - clock care , " @entity32 , an expert at the @entity10 base , is quoted as saying			0
" they also receive more buns , fruits and bamboo , so some clever pandas have used this to their advantage to improve their quality of life			0
" the birth of @entity14 's supposed cub and its progress in its early days , from its first cries to acquiring its distinctive black - and - white fur , were due to be broadcast online to panda lovers in @entity9 and worldwide			1
giant pandas are notoriously reluctant to breed in captivity and pseudo-pregnancies are common			1
the female is fertile for no more than three days a year , and the time span for a pregnancy is from 80 to 200 days , according to the @entity10 base			0
scientists will closely monitor behavioral and physiological signs , but it 's often a guessing game			0
even if a pregnancy proves genuine , baby pandas have very low survival rates			2
according to the @entity10 base , only a third to a half of pandas born in @entity9 captivity manage to survive past infancy			0
there was good news last month , though , when a panda gave birth to a healthy set of triplets in @entity9 's @entity78 in the southern city of @entity80			2
the cubs are thought to be the only living panda triplets in the world			0
@entity84 in @entity85 thinks its panda , @entity87 , could be the next to produce a cub , based on the latest scientific tests , but there are no guarantees			0
" it is very likely that we will not know 100 % if @entity87 is pregnant until she gives birth , " @entity92 , director of giant pandas for the @entity94 , said earlier this month			1
as few as 1,600 giant pandas survive in the mountain forests of central @entity9 , according to the @entity100 's @entity99 in @entity101			2
more than 300 pandas live in zoos and breeding centers around the world , most of them in @entity9 .			2
