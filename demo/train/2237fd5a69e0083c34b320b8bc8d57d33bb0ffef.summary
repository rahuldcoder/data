@entity0 -- with the posting of 400,000 classified documents from the @entity6 war , @entity2 has shown a much heavier hand redacting compared to its previous publication of documents			1
after the leak in july of more than 70,000 @entity13 documents , the website was heavily criticized by the @entity15 government , the military and human rights groups for failing to redact names of civilians in the documents , putting them at risk of retaliation by the @entity23			2
@entity25 officials had warned that it had similar concerns of exposure of @entity6 names			1
after the publication friday , press secretary @entity30 told @entity1 's " @entity36 , @entity15 " the military was in the process of notifying some 300 @entity6 whose names were in the documents			2
@entity2 founder @entity37 told @entity1 's @entity38 the site was more " vigorous " this time compared to the @entity41 process			1
but concerns of exposing civilians to harm did not seem to be the motivation			0
" in this case we have taken an even more vigorous approach than we took in relation of the @entity41 material , not because we believe that approach was particularly lacking [ but ] rather just to prevent those sort of distractions from the serious content by people who would like to try and distract from the message , " @entity37 said			0
an initial comparison of a few documents redacted by @entity2 to the same documents released by the @entity25 shows that @entity2 removed more information from the documents than the @entity25			1
@entity1 accessed the @entity25 versions from the official @entity64 website , where it posts items that have been released under the @entity66			1
the first incident examined by @entity1 was the case of a car that drove toward a group of soldiers moving on foot through @entity73 on january 18 , 2005			2
the version of the " significant action " ( @entity77 ) report released by the @entity25 said the unit involved was the a / 1 - 5 and it was a patrol ( abbreviated @entity80 )			1
when the car failed to stop after a single warning shot , the patrol " engaged the car " and killed two civilians			0
the same document released friday by @entity2 does not include the unit , the a / 1 - 5 , or that its members were on a patrol			1
in a summary of the incident , @entity2 redacted the number of killed civilians , but the accompanying narrative included the number			1
the second incident examined by @entity1 involved a car that approached a vehicle checkpoint near a bridge ten miles north of @entity100 on may 9 , 2005			0
the @entity25 version of the report says in part that the incident happened " @entity105 of @entity100			2
the sedan ran over berms built on the road ( with heavy equipment ) to warn and slow oncoming traffic			0
warning shots to deck at 125m ; to engine block at 100m			0
" but @entity2 removed any mention of @entity100 , a town in western @entity6 near @entity115			2
it also removed the word " berms " and at what distance the car deck and then engine block were targeted before the people in the car were shot			0
it also removed details on the death of one civilian and the wounding of another , which the @entity25 did release			1
even with redaction , the @entity25 is critical of the documents ' release , saying the site had no right to publish and is not equipped to understand what information is harmful			1
" the problem we have with @entity2 , it goes beyond just taking out names of people , " col. @entity134 , a top @entity25 spokesman said friday before @entity2 released the documents			1
" there are lots of other types of information that we 've described that could be damaging that go beyond names and they would n't have the expertise to know what those are			0
" @entity30 reiterated that point later in the day			0
" they are not experts about how to redact in a way that protects @entity15 forces , " @entity30 said on " @entity36 , @entity15			0
" " classified documents should not be in the public domain			2
at least not willy - nilly like this			0
" the big concern , @entity30 said , is that the documents provide insights into " patterns of behavior , our tactics , our techniques and our procedures			0

@entity2 did more redaction on this release of documents
@entity25 says group does not have *skills* to *selectively* edit
it also argues the release of documents is harmful in many *respects*
