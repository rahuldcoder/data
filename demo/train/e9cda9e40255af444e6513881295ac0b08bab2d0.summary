@entity0 -- @entity5 's military is developing longer - range ballistic and anti-ship missiles that are " shifting the balance of power in the region " and could help @entity9 secure resources or settle territorial disputes , a report released by the @entity3 said wednesday			1
@entity13 and @entity5 militaries need " resumption of dialogue , " adm. @entity12 told @entity17			2
@entity5 also continues to build up short - range missiles and increase its " coercive capabilities " against @entity20			0
the report suggests such moves constitute an effort to pressure @entity20 into settling the cross-strait dispute in favor of @entity5 , though tensions between the two countries have receded over the past year			0
the report , called the " @entity28 , " is the @entity3 's annual briefing to @entity17 on the status of the communist country 's military might			2
while @entity5 continues to proclaim that its military buildup is for defense purposes to protect its interests , the report says the country 's lack of transparency is worrisome and could lead to an unintended conflict			1
" the limited transparency in @entity5 's military and security affairs poses risks to stability by creating uncertainty and increasing the potential for misunderstanding and miscalculation , " according to the report			1
" much uncertainty surrounds @entity5 's future course , particularly regarding how its expanding military power might be used			1
" the lack of transparency causes @entity0 " to speculate to some degree on what their intentions are , " @entity3 spokesman @entity54 told reporters at a wednesday briefing			0
according to adm. @entity12 , the head of the @entity62 , some of that uncertainty is due to the cessation of talks between the @entity5 and @entity13 militaries			1
in march of 2008 , the @entity13 and @entity5 installed a hot line between the two countries ' militaries			2
but there have been no military - to - military talks since november 2008 , when @entity0 announced it was selling weapons to @entity20			0
" we are looking for the resumption of that dialogue so we can engage in discussion with our colleagues in the @entity5 and their army , @entity78 and @entity79 so we can have a sense of their way ahead , " @entity12 told the @entity72 on tuesday			0
" we do n't have a clear idea of their broad strategic way ahead			0
" the @entity3 report comes after a recent incident in which @entity5 ships , including a @entity5 navy vessel , confronted an unarmed @entity78 surveillance ship in the @entity91 in international waters			1
the confrontation prompted the @entity13 to move a destroyer ship to the area to protect the surveillance vessel			0
while the report does not discuss the incident , it notes the importance @entity5 puts on controlling its waterways and the surrounding territories because " @entity5 's economic and political power is contingent upon access to and use of the sea , and that a strong navy is required to safeguard such access			1
" the analysis also said that while much of @entity5 's capability is more for regional disputes , it did send two destroyers and one supply ship off the coast of @entity113 to protect @entity5 vessels from pirate attacks			2
that move was a sign of @entity5 intent to expand its militaries to protect expanding economic and political interests around the world , according to a @entity5 analyst			0
" the @entity5 military is being told to develop capabilities to deal with @entity5 national interests beyond the pure defense of @entity5 territory , " said @entity123 , the director of china studies for @entity125 , a nonprofit research group that does analysis for the @entity13 military and other clients			0
" @entity5 , with a global economy , now obviously has global political interests and clearly has expanding global security interests			0
" though the @entity3 report concludes that " @entity5 's ability to sustain military power at a distance remains limited , " it does have a growing space program , nuclear weapon system and cyber warfare capabilities , " the only aspects of @entity5 's armed forces that , today , have the potential to be truly global , " the report explained			1
in citing @entity5 's cyber warfare , the report notes that @entity13 government computers were the target of " intrusions that appear to have originated " from @entity5 , although they were not confirmed to be from the military .			1

cessation of talks between nations ' militaries partly to *blame* , @entity13 *admiral* says
