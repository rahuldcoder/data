" one day , as i sat in our driveway in @entity26 playing blocks and buckets , my curiosity got the better of me			0
@entity30 was sitting up , babbling and smiling , and i leaned down between her legs and carefully spread open her vagina , " she writes in the book			2
@entity33 -- known for taking hard - right positions that stir controversy -- seized upon the passages in a column for conservative publication @entity38			2
specifically , he accused @entity1 's parents of enabling " disturbing behavior that would be considered child abuse in many jurisdictions ... sexual abuse , specifically , of her younger sister , @entity30 , the sort of thing that gets children taken away from nonmillionaire families without @entity52 pedigrees and @entity54 social connections			1
" @entity56 's @entity55 picked up the torch , calling the book passage " disturbing			0
" @entity1 , creator and star of the popular @entity60 show " girls , " said she was " dismayed " over the interpretation of events described in her book			1
in a statement to @entity66 , she said she does not condone " any kind of abuse under any circumstances			0
" " childhood sexual abuse is a life - shattering event for so many , and i have been vocal about the rights of survivors			1
if the situations described in my book have been painful or triggering for people to read , i am sorry , as that was never my intention			0
" referring to her sister , she said , " anything i have written about her has been published with her approval			0
" over the weekend , @entity1 fired back on @entity83 , where she has 1.8 million followers , calling the allegations " upsetting and disgusting			0
" usually , " this is stuff i can ignore , " she said , " ... but do n't demean sufferers , do n't twist my words , back the f * * k up bros. " @entity1 then apologized on @entity83 for canceling book tour appearances scheduled for this week in @entity92 and @entity93 , @entity94			1
it was not clear monday whether the cancellations were related to the recent allegations			0
