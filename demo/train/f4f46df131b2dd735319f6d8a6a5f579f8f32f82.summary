the day after a @entity0 investigation uncovered airport employees access airplanes and tarmacs without undergoing daily security screening , officials admitted that no one checks criminal backgrounds after workers are hired			1
" it 's fair to say that once an employee survives an initial background check ... which gives them access to the airport ... they do n't go back and check criminal history ? " asked rep. @entity9 , @entity11 - @entity10 , chairman of a @entity12 , on tuesday			1
" that is correct from my knowledge , " said @entity21 , the @entity22 's deputy assistant director of counterterrorism			0
these security loopholes and others threatening @entity29 airports were critiqued at a hearing before the @entity31 , where lawmakers questioned current regulations guiding airport security			1
the hearing followed three recent breaches in @entity37 , including a gun smuggling operation in december , involving a @entity40 baggage handler and passenger			2
the baggage handler allegedly brought the guns to work , entered the gate area and passed the weapons onto a passenger who had already gone through security			2
a @entity0 investigation found that only two of the nation 's major airports -- @entity52 and @entity53 -- require all employees with secure access to pass through metal detectors			0
the @entity52 airport also conducts random criminal background checks after hiring employees			0
@entity60 , the general manager of @entity37 , where the breaches occurred , expressed support for implementing full screening of employees with access to secure areas of the @entity37 airport tuesday , but he did not specify if and when this screening will begin			1
" we recognize that 100 % screening of airport employees has operational and cost challenges , " @entity60 said in his written testimony			1
" but the unmistakable fact , as recent events suggest , is that we need to be consistently vigilant in our efforts			0
" " any system is only as strong as its weakest link , " @entity60 added			0
@entity60 said the @entity37 airport will begin reprogramming employee badges to limit the number of points employees can enter secure areas of the airport			0
@entity84 , the acting deputy administrator of the @entity85 , said the @entity85 is now examining these breaches to determine what investments and policy changes may be necessary			0
@entity84 cited a 2008 study by the @entity91 that concluded random screening of airport employees proved nearly as effective as 100 % screening , but he added an updated study could benefit current discussions			1
@entity9 questioned the logic of spending billions of dollars per year on passenger screening while not implementing similar security for employees			2
" what good is all the screening at the front door if we are not paying attention enough at the back door ? the answer is common sense , " @entity9 said in 2014 , the @entity85 performed 7,234 hours of random employee screening in @entity37 and 257,979 hours of nationally , but at tuesday 's hearing , @entity84 said the @entity37 breaches show @entity29 airports remain " open " and " porous " to threats			1
" we can do better , " he said .			0
