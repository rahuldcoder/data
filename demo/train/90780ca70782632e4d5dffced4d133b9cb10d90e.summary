-- it 's instructive to note what a killer actor @entity2 can be when a movie rises to his level			1
" arbitrage " is such a movie , a sinfully entertaining look at the sins committed in the name of money			2
for proof that we 're in financial hell , look around			0
true , this territory has been covered from @entity16 to last year 's " @entity17			2
" but @entity2 and first - time director @entity18 put a tantalizing spin on what goes on in the head of a fraudulent hedge - fund manager when he decides to stick it to the rest of us , including his own family			1
@entity2 's @entity27 is the picture of unflappable elegance			1
good job on that , since he 's just lost $ 400 million in a bad copper - mine investment , and if he ca n't cover it up and unload his company on a major bank , his career will go kaput along with his fortune			2
fraud puts pressure on @entity27 's skill at deceiving wife @entity41 ( @entity42 ) , @entity44 mistress @entity43 ( @entity45 ) and chief accountant @entity46 ) , who also happens to be his daughter			1
but @entity27 keeps his cool until the sudden death of one of these women has him dodging a possible murder rap with the grudging help of @entity54 ( a terrific @entity55 ) , the son of the family chauffeur and the only black man in @entity27 's circle of white privilege			2
that 's when @entity62 detective @entity61 ( @entity63 ) smells a rat and @entity27 's world begins to unravel			2
there 's enough plot here to stuff a miniseries or three , yet " arbitrage " never descends to bland and predictable			2
@entity71 , whose combustible directing debut gives " arbitrage " the charge of a thriller and the provocation of a moral fable			0
@entity18 has an eye for the telling detail , not surprising given his start with the 2005 documentary " @entity82 " ( about rogue director @entity83 )			0
docs run in the @entity18 family , with half brothers @entity86 ( " capturing the @entity88 " ) and @entity89 ( " @entity90 " ) making notable contributions to the genre			0
as the son of two commodities traders , @entity18 has @entity16 in his dna			0
and it resonates in his exceptional screenplay , which potently captures the gleaming seduction of @entity27 's world and the fear that festers underneath			0
and @entity2 knows the man , inside and out			1
his rapt , watchful performance is a thing of toxic beauty			1
@entity2 digs so deep into this flawed tycoon that we come to understand @entity27 's actions without for a minute forgiving them			1
wearing the trappings of wealth like a second skin , @entity2 invites us to see what @entity27 sees			1
and the glamour in his field of vision -- cheers to cinematographer @entity118 ( @entity120 ) for the sheen and composer @entity122 ( @entity123 ) for the seductive mood -- is tempting enough to make us all complicit			0
like the best movies , " arbitrage " persuades us to ask tough questions about ourselves			0
and @entity2 nails every nuance in a role that holds up a dark mirror to the way we live now			1
despite his box - office success in crowd - pleasers such as " @entity135 , " " @entity136 " and " @entity137 , " @entity2 has long been underrated			1
no @entity139 love , not even for his sinister brilliance in " @entity141 , " " @entity143 " and " @entity144 , " or for the battered heart he brought to the cheated - on husband in " unfaithful			0
" @entity2 's performance in " arbitrage " is too good to ignore			1
at 62 , he is at the peak of his powers			0
watch him in the scene when @entity42 -- in full , feisty flower -- hits @entity27 with a lifetime of resentments			1
she ca n't rock his composure			0
but @entity2 gives us a window into the soul of a man who finally realizes that even money will no longer help him lie to himself			1
it 's an implosive tour de force			0
