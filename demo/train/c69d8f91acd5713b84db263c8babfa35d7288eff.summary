the long - awaited peace talks between @entity3 and @entity1 resumed wednesday evening in @entity4 , a senior @entity1 official told @entity5 -- three years after the last direct negotiations stalled over the issue of settlements in disputed territory			1
as a gesture of goodwill , @entity3 began releasing more than two dozen @entity1 prisoners late tuesday on the eve of new peace talks that have been complicated by @entity3 plans for new housing in @entity4			1
some of the @entity1 had been held for more than 20 years			2
but as the vans rolled away , a group of demonstrators waved signs condemning the release , complaining that the prisoners had @entity3 blood on their hands			1
the prisoner release came after @entity3 said it would forge ahead with a plan to build 900 housing units in @entity4 , which the @entity1 hope will be the capital of their future state			1
opinion : why @entity32 's dark world view clouds peace prospects the issue of @entity3 settlements derailed the last round of direct talks in 2010 , and critics of @entity3 prime minister @entity32 say building on disputed territory could derail the new talks			1
" @entity32 has to decide which government he is heading : a government that is trying to reach a peace agreement , or a government that is trying to undermine all possibilities of this agreement , " said @entity42 , head of the @entity43 and the @entity3 opposition			1
in january , the @entity51 said @entity3 settlements amount to " creeping annexation " of @entity1 territories by @entity3 and have taken a " heavy toll " on the rights and sovereignty of @entity1			1
and in @entity59 , where @entity61 leaders have pushed both sides to return to the table , the @entity58 said it had " serious concerns " with the new announcement			0
" we 've encouraged both sides broadly speaking to refrain from taking steps that could undermine trust			0
we said that from the beginning , " @entity58 spokeswoman @entity70 said			0
" we 've also been clear that these are complicated issues , and there will be bumps in the road			0
" @entity76 , a columnist for the online @entity78 news site @entity79 , said the released prisoners are a bargaining chip to make sure the @entity1 do n't back out of the talks despite their anger over new settlements			1
opinion : five ways to tell is peace talks are serious " they 're trapped , and @entity89 has egg on his face today because he ca n't get out of the talks , " @entity76 told @entity5			1
both sides agreed to resume talks for nine months under @entity61 mediation , said @entity96 , a veteran @entity78 analyst at the @entity97			2
" this is a significant gesture , so therefore you 're going to hear a lot of noise from both sides -- complaints , grievances , " @entity96 said			0
" but you can pretty much discount most of what you hear in public , because they 're both clearly committed to doing this for nine months			0
and we really need to give it time to see what 's going to happen			0
" @entity89 and @entity32 are " hemmed in by domestic constraints , " leaving neither side likely to make significant changes on its own , @entity96 said			0
@entity61 secretary of state @entity117 said last week that " many difficult choices " lie ahead for both sides , but held out hope that " reasonable compromises " could be reached			2
@entity96 called that a " weak statement " that downplayed expectations for the talks			2
as a result , most observers have little hope that the talks will produce a breakthrough in the decades - old @entity3 - @entity1 conflict			1
but he said the @entity61 role in the talks is a " wild card " that could defy those expectations			2
" what is the @entity61 going to do ? " he asked			0
" will it push both sides ? will it pressure them ? will it cajole them ? will it entice them , and will it make serious bridging and endgame proposals ? we have no idea about any of that			0
