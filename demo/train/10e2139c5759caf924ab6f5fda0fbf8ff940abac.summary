-- this year marked the 50th anniversary of one of the most pivotal years in @entity4 history , from the assassination of president @entity6 to the historic " @entity9 " speech by the rev. @entity8 those two events were monumental , changing and shaping the course of @entity4 for years to come			1
but 1963 witnessed other moments , both big and small , that had a lasting impact			2
the @entity14 took its first flight			0
the first push - button telephone was introduced			0
the " red phone " between @entity18 and @entity19 , a hotline by the two superpowers to avert world crisis , was established			0
on the cultural front , instant replay was used for the first time when the army - navy game aired on @entity27			2
@entity29 's new movie , " @entity30 , " was released			2
and the @entity31 burst onto the music scene			0
here is a look back at some of those defining moments : the @entity6 assassination it marked the fourth time a @entity4 president had been assassinated , the first since @entity43 was killed in 1901			1
@entity6 was visiting @entity44 amid controversy over his stance on civil rights			1
yet the streets of @entity49 were packed on november 22 , 1963			2
thousands greeted the president and first lady as the motorcade wound its way through the city			0
the nation came to a standstill shortly after shots rang out			0
@entity6 was declared dead at 1 p.m. -- a moment etched in television history when @entity27 anchor @entity61 removed his glasses , paused and collected himself to deliver the news to the nation			1
5 things you may not know about the @entity6 assassination hundreds of conspiracy theories would abound later as to whether gunman @entity69 acted alone			1
but in the days and weeks afterward , the nation mourned together			0
another iconic image emerged from that time , of @entity6 's son , @entity72 , standing at attention next to the president 's flag - draped coffin			1
one @entity6 conspiracy that may be true march on @entity18 civil rights in the @entity4 was pushed to the fore in june 1963 with a series of events : @entity6 addressed the nation to call for civil rights legislation ; civil rights activist @entity84 was assassinated at his home in @entity86 ; and a defiant gov. @entity87 stood in the doorway at the @entity89 barring blacks from entering , until the federal government ordered him to step aside			1
why some movements work and others wilt those events brought the issue of equality for all to @entity97 and enlightened many @entity4 on the brutality faced by blacks in the @entity100			2
it also emboldened civil rights leaders as they brought their message -- along with hundreds of thousands of supporters -- to the steps of the @entity106 , culminating with @entity8 's iconic " @entity9 " speech on august 28 , 1963			1
how much has changed since the march on @entity18 ? ' @entity9 ' almost did n't make it into the speech the 16th @entity110 just weeks after the march on @entity18 , the civil rights movement was thrust into the headlines again -- this time the result of unspeakable tragedy			1
a bomb went off on september 15 , 1963 , at the @entity116 in @entity117 , @entity118 , killing four @entity120 - @entity4 girls			2
so tragic was the event that one @entity123 editor wrote about how one of the grieving mothers held her daughter 's shoe outside the bombed building : " in her hand she held a shoe , one shoe , from the foot of her dead child			2
we hold that shoe with her			0
" one small shoe : a legacy of the @entity117 bombing many historians credit the horror of the 16th @entity110 with turning the tide in @entity144 , resulting in the passage of the historic civil rights bill the following year			1
siblings of the bombing letter from @entity149 in early 1963 , @entity8 helped organize a massive protest in @entity117 , one of the most violently segregationist cities in the @entity100			1
but the protests faltered because activists could n't summon enough participants and were running out of bail money for those who had been arrested			0
@entity8 decided he needed to do something dramatic -- and provoked his arrest by leading a demonstration on april 12 , @entity160			1
in jail , @entity8 read an ad placed in a local newspaper by eight moderate white clergymen who called him an outside agitator and lawbreaker and counseled him to wait			1
@entity8 did n't take their advice			2
scribbling in the margins of the newspaper or on whatever paper he could find , he unloaded on the clergymen			0
writing only from memory , he cited @entity174 , @entity175 , the @entity176 philosopher @entity174 and the theologian @entity177			0
he gave his writing to his lawyer , who smuggled it out of jail , had it typed up and copied			0
it was published by the @entity184 as a pamphlet and appeared in the @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188			0
@entity8 's " @entity194 " became a chapter in his popular 1964 book , " @entity191 , " and is considered a classic defense of civil disobedience			1
how @entity8 became an angry black man @entity196 it may seem silly to refer to the @entity31 as the original boy band , but that 's what they were in 1963			1
the release of the @entity205 band 's debut album , " @entity206 , " on march 22 , 1963 , was the start of a cultural revolution that would change the music landscape for decades to come			1
in a single year , the @entity31 went from relative obscurity to playing in front of 73 million @entity4 on " the @entity212			0
" that year also witnessed the launch of other musicians who became icons , including the @entity216 and @entity217			0
the lasting impact of their revolution influenced not just music , but modern art , design and fashion for decades to come			0
the @entity31 , @entity217 and @entity225 : 50 years since the youthful revolution			0
