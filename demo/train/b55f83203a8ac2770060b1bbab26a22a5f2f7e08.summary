a new class of cholesterol - fighting drugs could be coming to patients in the not - so - distant future , and experts say they could be a real game - changer in @entity7 ' battle to lower artery - clogging @entity8 , or " bad , " cholesterol			1
the drugs , known as @entity12 inhibitors , work to suppress a particular gene that regulates how much cholesterol the liver can filter out of the body			1
in early phase 3 trials , the inhibitors have shown to be safe and to work in reducing ldl cholesterol levels to previously unknown lows			1
as interesting as the drugs themselves is the process by which they were discovered			1
ten years ago , researchers found a family in @entity30 with a long history of extremely high levels of @entity8 , incidents of cardiovascular disease and early deaths , says dr. @entity33 , global head of @entity12 development for @entity36 , a pharmaceutical company working on a @entity12 inhibitor in partnership with @entity39			1
tests revealed that the family had a rare mutation on the gene called @entity12			1
additional studies showed that individuals with underactive @entity12 genes had low levels of ldl and , much more important , low levels of cardiovascular disease			1
" that became the most exciting potential target in cardiovascular medicine , " @entity33 said			2
it 's this discovery that has @entity36 and two other major drug companies , @entity53 and @entity54 , racing to develop a drug that mimics the gene 's effects			1
the best approach , experts say , will be through monoclonal antibodies : antibodies that are created in a lab and help your immune system fight a disease or , in this case , fight cholesterol			1
" pcsk9 inhibitors could offer an important treatment option for patients , particularly for those who are in need of greater @entity8 reductions beyond what the current standards of care can offer , " said @entity68 , a spokesman for @entity54 , one of the companies working on this new type of drug			1
" this is not to replace statin therapy , " said @entity81 , senior vice president of research and development at @entity53			0
" this is actually to get patients to ( their ) goal who ca n't get there			0
" time : statins safe for most people normal ldl levels hover somewhere in the 100 to 130 mg / @entity93 range , according to the @entity94			1
anything above that , your doctor starts to get concerned			0
" with a statin medication , you can often get somebody 's cholesterol between 70 and 100 mg / @entity93 , " said dr. @entity99 , president - elect of the @entity94 and a dean at @entity102			2
" if you use these monoclonal antibodies , you could see a number way less than 50			0
" this excites doctors like @entity99 , who is not connected to the research but often sees patients with cholesterol numbers in the hundreds			2
" i would say this is a game changer			0
" but is there such a thing as cholesterol levels being too low ? we do n't really know , @entity99 says , but he believes the lower , the better			1
" @entity121 , when they 're less than a year old , have smooth arteries , and their @entity8 is 40 or less , " he said			0
the initial research into the @entity12 gene also found people with virtually no pcsk9 activity who lived their entire lives with extremely low cholesterol			1
researchers observed no ill effects in those patients			0
the safety data from the clinical trials are good , and experts say these drugs could help patients who ca n't tolerate or do not respond to traditional cholesterol - lowering drugs			1
" @entity141 were generally well - tolerated , " @entity99 said			0
" although the studies were n't comprised of millions of patients and duration of follow - up was n't as long as we 'd like , the signals we 're seeing are all very positive			2
" as excited as the pharmaceutical giants are about this new discovery , this is n't ready for prime time			2
for one thing , the drugs are not approved by the @entity154 , although @entity99 said it probably wo n't be long			1
" these drugs are of such great interest that there will likely be an aggressive approach to conducting large - scale trials for @entity154 approval and perhaps expedited review , " he said			1
" it 's hard to know exactly when these drugs will be available , but i 'm guessing it 'll be less than two years			2
" another issue with the drugs is that they ca n't be taken orally			2
" you ca n't swallow this , because the digestive enzymes in your stomach would break up the protein , " @entity99 said			0
" it 's given by subcutaneous injections ( into a lower level of skin ) , but this can be done with very small needles			0
" researchers say patients would need to give themselves injections only every two to four weeks , which , depending on how often they 're taking pills to lower cholesterol , may be a less cumbersome option			2
finally , these types of medications are very expensive to make and difficult to store and require a much more extensive manufacturing process than a pill			0
" they are heat - sensitive and open to risk of microbial contamination , so issues of shelf life and handling are always front and center , " @entity99 said			0
" this means they 're probably going to be more expensive than pills			0
" but @entity99 believes , as the saying goes , an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure			0
" how much is it worth to use a more expensive treatment up front to avoid downstream events that are more expensive ? " he asked			0
" if you think prevention is expensive , try treating disease			0

drugs suppress a gene that regulates how much cholesterol liver filters out
studies show people with low levels of @entity12 have low levels of ldl cholesterol
pharmaceutical companies are working to get these drugs approved by the @entity154
