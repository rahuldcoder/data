@entity0 -- many times i 've watched in dismay as crowds of @entity6 supporters gathered to wave flags in front of @entity10 's former dictator -- in particular , two years ago , when the convicted murderer @entity11 returned to his home country under the guise of near - death , to be welcomed as a hero , banners waving , @entity6 embracing the man who helped him kill my brother			1
we watched in jaw - dropped horror as these two conspirators embraced in front of what we believed to be a throng of paid political cheerleaders			0
we 'd often heard that part of the way @entity6 kept up the sparkly image of a happy , well - led people was to pay them to show up and look as though they were viewing a god			1
it 's classic imperial propaganda : make sure the little people show the love when the cameras are on			2
it 's a method designed by @entity40 and painstakingly perfected by @entity6			1
today , as i look at the images streaming from halfway around the world , my heart is deeply moved by what i see on the faces of a liberated people			0
in a country where the economic disparity has historically been far greater than any place since @entity50 , a true revolution has occurred			0
the impoverished , the downtrodden , the unlawfully imprisoned , the enslaved , are all pouring into the streets with their new , green flag of freedom , tears of relief and even disbelief etched on their faces			0
my 23 - year struggle for justice is a grain of sand compared to what the @entity10 people have endured			1
@entity6 's death an answer to little girl 's prayer i have had countless e-mails and phone calls today , asking me if i 'm happy , and if i feel that my brother can finally rest in peace			1
at the risk of sounding like i 'm never satisfied , i have to say that i am not entirely happy			0
sure , some weird , throttled joy is bubbling up in me today , and i do n't hold with any camp that would contend that " @entity6 deserved a fair trial			1
" but yet i fear that with his death goes a warehouse of secrets and lies that could have been revealed in order to salve the souls of @entity10 families who lost loved ones during this regime			2
men and women have literally disappeared from their houses and places of work and worship , only to be buried in mass graves			0
i know where my brother rests in peace , innocent of any crime other than being an @entity100 on the wrong plane at the very wrong time in history			0
rather than wanting to see the kind of freak - show snuff film of @entity6 that is worming its way through the internet as i write this , i would have far preferred to watch him from a front row seat in the @entity111 as he , in true @entity113 style , would have been made to answer for his countless hideous crimes			2
in the 23 years since i lost my brother i have fought ( alongside my parents ) for this day			1
many times i have been accused of wanting revenge , of not tempering my desire to see @entity6 and all his cohorts brought to heel			2
today , as that dish is served to me ice - cold , i can tell you honestly it has never been about revenge			0
today , as ever , it has been about justice , for those 270 innocent @entity100 and @entity126 citizens who fell to earth like so many doused stars on a cold night in late december			0
today , as ever , it has also been about justice for the 6.5 million @entity10 , who no longer need to be paid to look happy when the world 's cameras point their way			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			2

@entity135 : it has been 23 years since **bombing** of @entity139 *103*
@entity135 ' s brother was killed in the **bombing** , and family has waited for justice
he says he would rather have seen @entity6 face war crimes trial for harm he caused
@entity135 : it is n't about revenge , but justice for @entity139 victims and for @entity10 's people
