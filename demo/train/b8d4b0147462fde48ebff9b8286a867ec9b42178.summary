-- it 's a perennial problem			2
how do you persuade young , apathetic voters to go to the polls ? enter " @entity5 " -- @entity6 's rather ill - judged and short - lived cartoon solution			1
the cartoon opens with two apparently politically disaffected young men			2
the scene switches to @entity5 , a muscle - bound , stubble - chinned superhero , answering a call asking him to persuade voters to have their say in the upcoming @entity16 elections			1
naked , he leaps up from a bed surrounded by women apparently performing sex acts on him and -- having donned a leather waistcoat and trousers -- sets off from a @entity24 villain-esque island hideout on his mission , riding a pair of harnessed dolphins as waterskis			0
an orgy of cartoon violence follows -- one of the original men is decapitated , while other would - be non-voters are punched , slapped and tossed through the windows of a polling station to vote			1
the cartoon is the unlikely creation of the @entity6 @entity16 's @entity39 information center , originally posted to its official @entity41 page			1
less surprisingly perhaps , it has now been pulled and an apology made for its graphic sexual and violent content			0
@entity45 , speaker of the @entity6 @entity16 , said in a statement on his @entity48 page that many people had perceived the cartoon as " more serious and offensive than it was intended , and see it as talking down to the youth			1
" reaction in social media is sharply divided between those who see this as unacceptably vulgar , and those who think it is tough but acceptable humor which brings attention to the vote on may 25			0
" the latter was the intention			0
but i acknowledge that @entity16 , as an institution , in future has to show more caution in what we put our name to			2
" the cartoon tells the story of how @entity5 , as a young man , once forgot to vote in @entity16 elections			1
this , the narration says , taught him a painful lesson : " no influence on climate regulations , agricultural subsidies , chemicals in toys -- and the amount of cinnamon allowed in his cinnamon buns			0
" horrified by this , he decided he would dedicate his life to making everybody vote			0
so if you 're not going to vote , do n't try to run , do n't try to hide , because he will find you			0
and he will make you vote			0
" the @entity16 elections , in which voters in each of the @entity39 's member states elect representatives to the body , are taking place across @entity99 next week			1
may 25 is the day on which @entity6 voters will go to the polls			2
@entity6 's turnout for the last @entity99 elections in 2009 was close to 60 % , well above the @entity99 average of 43 %			1
@entity0 's @entity105 contributed to this report .			0
