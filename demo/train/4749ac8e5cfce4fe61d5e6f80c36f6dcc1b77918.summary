-- at least 12 airplanes shared the trans - @entity3 sky with doomed @entity5 , but none reported any problems , deepening the mystery surrounding the cause of the plane 's disappearance			1
image released by the @entity13 shows oil slicks in the water near a debris site			0
@entity17 confirmed that at least a dozen aircraft departed roughly at the same time and traversed approximately the same route , but did not report problematic weather conditions			2
this has led some aviation experts to suggest that technical problems on the airplane might be the main cause of the crash , though they may have combined with weather conditions to create serious problems			1
the new information raises more questions than answers about @entity31 447 , believed to have plunged into the @entity3 somewhere between the coasts of @entity33 and @entity34 on may 31 , presumably killing all 228 aboard			1
the plane 's computer system reported a series of technical problems about four hours after takeoff and immediately after entering a large storm system a few hundred miles from the far eastern coast of @entity33			1
severe winds , updrafts and even lightning have been mentioned as possible causes of the crash , potentially triggering a failure of the plane 's technical systems			0
but aviation experts cautioned that weather alone would not normally cause a crash			1
planes routinely fly through large storms , using the sensitive radar on board to navigate through specific storm cells			0
when conditions are severe enough , planes can easily deviate around or above storms , experts say			0
in addition to @entity5 , @entity31 had four other @entity63 - bound flights that left in the same broad time frame from that part of the world , according to an airline spokesman			2
one flight left @entity70 , @entity33 , at 4:20 p.m. at that same moment , another @entity31 flight left nearby @entity71			2
a third @entity31 flight left @entity73 , @entity74 , at 5:50 p.m. , also heading for @entity63			0
a final @entity31 flight left @entity71 at 7:10 p.m. , almost exactly when the doomed flight took off from @entity70			0
all of these flights took a similar route toward @entity63 , heading first toward @entity79 on the east coast of @entity33 and then continuing northeast over the @entity3			1
none of the other flights experienced anything unusual , the spokesman said			0
all arrived in @entity63 the next day , with no significant delays of any kind			0
that same evening two @entity88 flights bound for @entity89 , @entity90 , left @entity33 at about the same time as flight 447 ; one departed from @entity70 and another from @entity71 , according to officials at @entity88			1
those flights also reported no problems			2
it was the same story for one @entity98 flight and three @entity100 flights , all of which flew routes similar to the missing plane			0
although none of the other flights are known to have reported weather problems en route , aviation experts said weather can change suddenly and vary over short distances , so one plane might experience conditions far worse than another .			1

at least 12 flights traveled from @entity33 to @entity115 around same time as 447
none of the other flights reported *bad* weather or other problems
aviation experts say weather alone would not normally cause a crash
they also say weather can change *quickly* and vary over short distances
