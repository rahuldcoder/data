-- millions of @entity2 parents spend countless hours trying to figure out how to help their children get better grades , better teachers or better schools			1
they may want to take a page from @entity10 , which is considered to have one of the leading education systems in the world			1
@entity10 students consistently score near the top in the @entity16 , or @entity16 , for reading , mathematics and science			0
the 2012 @entity16 results tell us that in these three subjects combined @entity10 ranks third after @entity23 and @entity24			0
in comparison , @entity2 students ' combined performance in reading , mathematics and science places the @entity2 at 21st among 34 @entity31 countries			0
for some , education in @entity10 is utopia : a dreamland where teaching is the most desired profession , authorities trust schools and political parties agree on the direction of educational reforms			1
for others , they are surprised to hear that in @entity10 children do n't start school until they are 7 years old			2
they have less homework than their peers in other countries			0
a child 's socioeconomic background is less of an impediment to academic performance			0
and there is only one standardized test , which is administered in the final year of high school			0
what are the main factors that prevent @entity2 students from achieving the kind of success that @entity10 students attain ? there are three things that have positively affected the quality of @entity10 schools that are absent in @entity2 schools			1
first , @entity10 has built a school system that has over time strengthened educational equity			1
this means early childhood education for all children , funding all schools so they can better serve those with special educational needs , access to health and well - being services for all children in all schools , and a national curriculum that insists that schools focus on the whole child rather than narrow academic achievement			0
opinion : should schools ban homework ? second , teachers in @entity10 have time to work together with their colleagues during the school day			2
according to the most recent data provided by the @entity31 the average teaching load of junior high school teachers in @entity10 is about half what it is in the @entity2			1
that enables teachers to build professional networks , share ideas and best practices			0
this is an important condition to enhancing teaching quality			0
finally , play constitutes a significant part of individual growth and learning in @entity10 schools			0
every class must be followed by a 15 - minute recess break so children can spend time outside on their own activities			0
schooldays are also shorter in @entity10 than in the @entity2 , and primary schools keep the homework load to a minimum so students have time for their own hobbies and friends when school is over			1
the difference is pronounced in @entity2 , where a national poll of elementary school principals found that up to 40 % of @entity2 school districts have reduced or eliminated recess in order to free more time for core academics , and one in four elementary schools no longer provides recess to all grades			2
i hear people often arguing that because the @entity2 is much bigger , more diverse , and more unequal , it 's harder to reach higher quality education			2
but even if this were true , it would not explain why in @entity10 students learn better in their schools than in most other places in the world			2
opinion : let kids sleep late some aspects of the @entity2 school system are not helpful in improving education quality and equity			1
first , education in the @entity2 is too much defined by testing and data			1
if getting the data using frequent standardized tests occupies up to one - third of all available time to teach , that will alone prevent students from making the marks they should			0
second , @entity2 education places too much faith in marketplace choice , which parents have because of expanded access to charter schools			1
this weakens the public school structure that is fundamental to many successful education systems elsewhere			1
finally , more students in @entity2 have novice or nonprofessional teachers in their classrooms today than ever			0
frequent turnover of teachers in thousands of @entity2 schools undermines the entire education system			1
what would be the way forward then ? the @entity2 ca n't become @entity10 , but there is a lot it can learn about what works and what does n't			1
one affordable and smart step would be to terminate policies and practices that prevent @entity2 teachers from teaching what matters most to their students			2
redesigning current punitive accountability for schools and abolishing unnecessary standardized tests would remove a big burden from schools and leave teachers with more time to focus on real learning			0
opinion : get schools out of the 1890s the ultimate test for the @entity2 education system will be whether it can bring equity to the forefront of education policies			1
when poverty explains up to half of student achievement , schools must have measures to better cope with the harmful consequences that disadvantaged family backgrounds have on teaching and learning in many schools			0
enhancing equity has been one key to success in @entity10 .			2

many @entity2 parents worry about their kids getting good grades and doing well in school
@entity218 : @entity10 has one of the leading education systems in the world
he says @entity2 can learn from @entity10 in building an education system that enhances equity
@entity218 : @entity2 education focuses on testing and data , which *skews* teaching priorities
