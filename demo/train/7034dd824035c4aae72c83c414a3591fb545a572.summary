-- fresh from a victory that saw a pair of online - piracy bills shelved , web - freedom advocates are now fighting to preserve their right to jailbreak their iphones			0
the @entity8 , a key player in the fight against the @entity11 , is urging people to ask the @entity14 government to declare that hacking their own smartphone , tablet or other device is not a crime			0
" smartphones , tablets , and video game consoles are powerful computers with lots of untapped potential , " the group says on its website			1
" yet many of these devices are set up to run only software that 's been approved by the manufacturer			0
" modifying a device to run independent software -- known as jailbreaking -- is important to programmers , enthusiasts , and users			2
" " jailbreaking " a phone gives users the ability to download unauthorized apps from any source			1
it 's particularly popular on @entity7 because of @entity44 's famously closed environment , which only allows apps bought from its own stores to be used on the phones			1
jailbreaking also allows an owner to unlock their phone and switch mobile carriers			2
@entity44 's phones , and its @entity55 , typically come with an exclusive contract with a mobile provider ( originally only @entity58 in the @entity14 , although @entity60 and @entity61 versions have been added )			1
in july 2010 , the @entity62 issued a ruling that exempted jailbreaking from the @entity64 ( @entity64 ) -- the same law used last week to shut down file - sharing site @entity67			0
under @entity64 , @entity44 had the right to request a $ 2,500 government fine for " circumvention of technological measures			2
" that could be interpreted to extend to jailbreaking , since the @entity7 's @entity74 software is copyrighted			1
@entity44 had never actually fined one of its customers , but maintained its right to do so and filed an objection to the copyright office 's ruling while it was in the planning stages			2
the @entity8 is asking the copyright office to extend the 2010 exemption , which will otherwise expire this year , and add tablets like the @entity55 to it			1
they 're also asking for a specific exemption for video - game consoles			1
the group is specifically asking " people who depend on the ability to jailbreak to write , use , and / or tinker with independent software ( from useful apps to essential security fixes ) " to contact the office			0
the @entity97 , another group working on the issue , is asking that exemptions be extended to all personal computing devices			0
" people must have the right to control the software running on devices they own , " said @entity100 , a lawyer with the group			0
" that right is essential to the continued development of free and open source software and is foundational to our privacy , security , and freedom , online and off			0
" @entity44 did not respond to a request for a comment for this story			0
in the past , the company has said that jailbreaking , which voids an @entity7 's warranty , can introduce bugs and other problems			1
" @entity44 's goal has always been to insure that our customers have a great experience with their @entity7 , and we know that jailbreaking can severely degrade the experience , " a company spokeswoman said in response to the @entity62 ruling in 2010			1
" the vast majority of customers do not jailbreak their iphones			0

advocates want @entity7 ' jailbreaking ' to stay legal
jailbreaking lets users change carriers or download apps not in the @entity44 store
groups also want a legal exemption added for @entity55 , video game consoles
