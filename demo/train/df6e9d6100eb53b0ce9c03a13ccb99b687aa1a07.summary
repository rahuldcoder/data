-- let 's take a little quiz			0
which piece of home technology do you think uses the most electricity ? @entity7 @entity8 @entity10 / set - top box @entity11 television if you answered set - top box ( c ) , you 're right			1
that little box near your tv -- the one that plays and records cable television -- uses more electricity than a modern refrigerator , and it probably sucks down more power than the tv it 's attached to , according to a recent report from the @entity23			1
surprised ? you should be			0
in this day and age , we 've come to expect that technology will help us save electricity , not waste it			2
but when it comes to electronics , there are glaring exceptions to the rule that more technology makes our lives more efficient			1
it seems technology has become simultaneously the hero and villain of the energy - efficiency movement			1
in the long term , research shows , tech will help us build energy - saving homes and will aid in our quest to get electricity from renewable sources			1
but , right now , our growing appetite for consumer electronics seems to be creating overlooked electricity waste and is offsetting gains made in other sectors			2
in recent weeks , environmental groups have made set - top boxes @entity53			1
" this is a huge energy consumer that nobody knows about , " @entity55 , a senior scientist with the @entity23 , said of set - top boxes			1
" the secret is out that these products waste $ 2 billion a year in energy ... when consumers are n't using them			2
and we really need the industry to move forward and do a better job here			2
" why is that the case ? there are several problems , @entity55 said , with this piece of technology			2
here are a few : you ca n't turn most set - top boxes off or put them in " sleep " mode			1
if you hit the power button , all that happens is the clock gets a little dimmer ; virtually no energy is actually saved by " powering down			2
" set - top boxes are everywhere ; the @entity23 estimates there are 160 million set - top boxes in @entity85 homes , about one for every two people in the country			1
cable companies usually own the set - top box , so consumers do n't have much choice in whether it 's energy efficient ( the council suggests that consumers call their cable companies and request a more efficient model that has a sleep mode )			1
in aggregate , @entity85 spend $ 3 billion per year powering these devices , the group says			2
new data about how much energy these never - off set - top boxes really use have caused a sort of sea change in the energy efficiency world			1
regulators are now , for the first time , considering energy efficiency regulations caps for set - top boxes and wireless routers , according to @entity112 , supervisor of the appliance standards program at the @entity85 @entity114			1
it 's unclear whether standards will be put in place , he said , but they could be adopted without reducing the devices ' performance			0
the proliferation of consumer technology is also a driver of the concern			1
this year , the average @entity85 home has 24 pieces of consumer electronics , according to a survey from the @entity129			1
twenty years ago , a standard home only had 9.7 electronics ; in 1980 , it was only 2.8 per household			2
( the survey includes computers , gaming systems , tvs , gps , dvd players and audio systems in its list of products )			0
beyond those , it seems everything these days needs to be plugged in			0
" who would have thought 20 years ago that we would need electronic books or toothbrushes or coffee grinders ? " said @entity145 , a research analyst at the @entity146			0
" there 's hardly a thing you could point to that is n't already plugged in -- and it certainly has implications for electricity use			0
" these devices are also getting bigger			0
the @entity85 @entity160 estimates that there are 275 million tvs in use in the @entity85 today -- almost one for every person			0
of those , 20 million have screens that are 40 inches or larger , said @entity167 , @entity160 team lead for @entity170 product development			0
all of this adds up to a new reality for home energy use : electronics are a larger part of our energy diets than ever before			1
along with appliances , electronics made up 17 % percent of an average household 's energy use in 1978 ; in 2005 , that jumped to 31 %			1
other home energy wasters -- like light bulbs , air conditioners and water heaters -- are subject to regulations that aim to curb energy use without degrading quality , @entity167 said			1
the same may happen for electronics , she said			0
in 2009 , @entity191 became the first state to pass energy efficiency requirements for @entity162			0
the state estimated at the time that consumers would save a total of $ 1 billion per year in electricity because of the standards			0
overall , consumers should n't blame technology for energy waste , @entity167 said			2
if anything , new tech may be what helps get us out of this mess			0
take smartphones , she said			0
those @entity208 army knife gadgets replace gps devices , mobile phones and , to a certain extent , portable computers			0
tech is also being used to make energy systems and individual appliances more efficient			1
and technology is being used to try to coerce people into using less power voluntarily			0
one company called @entity222 , for example , uses smart grid technology to tell people how much electricity they use compared with their neighbors , in hopes this will guilt them into using less power			0
the better technology gets , and the more widely it 's adopted , the more energy we save , according to recent projections from the @entity146			2
if people develop and adopt lots of new technology , our per - person energy use will drop 34 % by 2035 , estimates show			1
if we keep using the same old stuff we were using in 2010 , per person energy use will drop much less significantly : only about 10 % , the report says			0
so , in the end , maybe tech is n't the villain after all .			0

a greater percentage of home energy use comes from electronics these days
an average home has 24 pieces of consumer technology , says industry group
set - top boxes , which play and record cable tv , are among the bigger energy suckers
@entity114 is considering regulations to make those boxes more efficient
