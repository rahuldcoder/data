-- one day before the election , tensions are running high and poll numbers are being crunched every few hours			2
nowhere is this truer than in @entity4 -- the pathway to victory			1
so there was a collective gasp friday when a last - minute directive from @entity4 's secretary of state , a @entity11 , threatened to invalidate a number of provisional ballots			1
when the fate of the nation could hinge on a handful of votes , arcane state rules and local politicians ' motives take on a new urgency			2
earlier last week the @entity23 campaign complained to @entity25 's attorney general about what it said was " willful misrepresentation " by the @entity29 campaign in the materials used to train @entity32 poll watchers			0
at issue was whether people in @entity25 with felony convictions could vote			0
( they can , once they complete their sentences , but the @entity29 documents had said they ca n't			0
) given that this fact can be googled in less than 10 seconds , one must conclude the @entity29 campaign was either grossly ignorant of election law or intentionally deceiving volunteers in an effort to swing the vote			0
opinion : vote , damn it ! this election year is the culmination of years of @entity11 efforts to foment confusion and fear to keep certain @entity51 from voting			1
that is a subplot of this election , but one that will have massive consequences			0
in close and bitterly fought elections , there 's far more at stake than who occupies the @entity62 : @entity51 ' belief in the integrity of our democracy hangs in the balance			0
these efforts are pernicious , pervasive and professionalized			0
in a recent @entity71 article , @entity69 profiled @entity72 , a legal fellow at the conservative @entity73 who has been hyping the myth of voter impersonation fraud since 1998 , despite mountains of evidence refuting his claim			1
( the @entity79 has concluded that many more people are struck by lightning than commit in - person voter fraud			1
) rep. @entity83 -- a civil rights hero who bled to get all @entity51 the right to vote -- describes @entity72 as waking up every morning thinking " what can i do today to make it more difficult for people to vote ? " @entity72 is a close adviser to @entity88 , a @entity89 - based organization funded by wealthy conservative donors that has led challenges against the registration of minority voters across the country			1
because of these challenges , thousands of @entity51 who have voted reliably in the same place every year have had to attend formal hearings to defend their registrations or be disqualified from voting			0
the group has been so aggressive and so inaccurate in its work that rep. @entity102 has said it could " amount to a criminal conspiracy to deny legitimate voters their constitutional rights			0
" the backbone of the voter suppression movement has been the national push to institute a labyrinth of voter identification laws			1
thirty - three states have passed such laws since 2009			1
opinion : what 's really at stake in election 2012 the result has been confusion and sloppy implementation as overburdened poll volunteers have had to memorize constantly changing regulations			1
meanwhile , millions of @entity51 , including tens of thousands of seniors , will be disenfranchised because they do n't have the required @entity124 or they are simply confused by the laws			0
while advocates claim they are just trying ensure a fair vote , @entity127 's @entity126 house majority leader @entity126 infamously spilled the beans in june when he claimed the state 's new voter id law would deliver the state to @entity29			1
recent news reports suggest that if there is an actual attempt at systemic voter fraud , it 's coming from @entity11 - affiliated groups			1
meet @entity140 : a longtime @entity11 operative paid $ 3 million by the @entity11 to register voters in five states this cycle			1
evidence suggests @entity140 's company , @entity145 , has been systematically encouraging falsifying signatures and having workers lie to voters			2
the @entity11 severed ties with @entity140 's group when these allegations became public , but his relationships with the party and affiliated groups date back to 2004 , and the allegations against him date back almost as long			1
a @entity156 search turns this information up in a couple of seconds			0
some @entity51 values do trump election victories if the choice between the two is laid bare			0
the @entity164 , the driver for much of the voter @entity124 legislation , has faced a revolt of its corporate members as citizen consumers have expressed their outrage : thirty - seven companies have left @entity164 , including such high - profile names as @entity173 , @entity174 , and @entity175			2
@entity176 has been forced to take down billboards making vague threats of legal action against voters in low - income and minority neighborhoods after a campaign by civil rights group @entity184			2
and courts in @entity127 ruled that a new voter id law can not be enforced in this election after hearing from plaintiffs like 92 - year old @entity190 , who showed she would be disenfranchised since she has no birth certificate			1
regardless of who wins , if the election proves as close as it appears , it 's likely that the demand for recounts and accusations on both sides will fly fast and furious			2
but this erosion of @entity51 ' rights requires a clear and comprehensive solution -- universal legislation that makes it easier to vote for all @entity51 regardless of their circumstances			0
our democracy depends on it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			2

@entity210 : @entity4 secretary of state 's 11th - hour directive could invalidate provisional ballots
she says it 's part of @entity11 push to confuse election process to suppress certain voters
she says @entity11 pushed through voter id laws in *33* states on made - up claim of voter fraud
@entity210 : systematic efforts to keep people from voting threaten entire democratic process
