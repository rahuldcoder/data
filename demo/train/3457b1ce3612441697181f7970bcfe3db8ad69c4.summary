-- the referees walked onto the field at @entity3 in @entity4 thursday night before the @entity4 faced the @entity5 and heard the strangest thing : cheers			1
not just a few of them , either			0
they heard a standing ovation , long and loud from the early arriving fans , enough so that head referee @entity12 tipped his cap to the appreciative crowd like a conquering hometown hero			0
if you had n't followed the developments over the previous three weeks , you would 've thought the world had gone mad			1
if you did follow them -- and , if you 're a football fan , how could you not ? -- you probably felt the urge to stand in your living room and cheer right along with them			1
the real referees are back			0
the long national nightmare with replacement officials -- the unqualified rejects from the @entity27 or @entity28 college games -- ended this week , but not before creating an odd phenomena among sports fans from coast to coast			1
refs were getting the love -- from football fans , from current and former players , and even from president @entity37			1
when the president tweeted that he wanted the real referees back on the field , it was only a matter of time before it happened -- and one more sign that there was a real appreciation for the professionals			0
" it is unfortunate that the @entity50 , @entity52 's game , has been reduced to what it is , " @entity46 , the thoughtful defensive lineman for the @entity47 , said before the lockout was settled			1
" i think a lot of people are looking at it as a joke , honestly			0
as a fan , you pay all this money and you go psls and ... games are just being tossed up like as if you were throwing dice on a craps table			1
" the lockout of the regular referees ended on wednesday when their union agreed to an eight - year deal with the @entity50 , ending a dispute that centered mostly on retirement benefits and compensation			1
before it ended , there were a few lessons for @entity50 fans : 1			1
their collective outrage can make a difference			1
and the outrage was from coast to coast			2
it started to build during the second week of the season , when it became clear that games had more borderline penalties and less flow with the replacement officials , but it reached a crescendo during the monday night broadcast this week			1
an already choppy game between the @entity91 and the @entity92 came down to one final play			2
a hail mary pass from @entity96 quarterback @entity95 heaved into the end zone that appeared to be intercepted by @entity92 safety @entity98			0
but @entity91 receiver @entity100 grabbed it at the last second , and when the two players fell to the ground , the two referees watching looked at each other before making a ruling			0
one of them waved his arms to signify an interception			0
the other lifted his arms to signify a touchdown			0
and , when the refs eventually ruled that it was a touchdown ( missing a blatant offensive pass interference call before the play ) , a national firestorm had begun			2
@entity117 recorded 56,000 tweets per minute during the game -- or nearly the same as @entity37 's speech at the @entity121 -- and most of them angry			1
with one play , the @entity91 had stolen a 14 - 12 victory and as much as $ 250 million had moved from one side of the ledger to the other because of the betting line , according to @entity130 experts			2
@entity131 , the influential co-owner of the @entity47 , watched the replay of the " @entity133 , " as it became known , on tuesday morning and thought , " how did this happen ? " he was n't directly involved in the negotiations between the league and the referees ' union , but he said the talks intensified			0
" i felt like we were moving toward a contract even before monday night , but i 'm not sure we would have gotten it done this week , " @entity140 said			2
" i think the game sped up the process -- on both sides			2
" for the owners , or at least from my point of view , it was the final straw because i started to see it would be very difficult for replacement refs to do their jobs the following weekend			1
even the @entity50 is n't immune to criticism			1
the @entity50 has enjoyed an unprecedented run as the dominant sports league in this country , and that was never in doubt even during the lockout			1
ratings were still sky high for the games , and the outrage over the replacement officials was such a dominant story that it confirmed the league 's popularity more than it threatened it			1
the league thought there would n't be much sympathy for the referees -- they are , after all , an unpopular group			0
but the owners discovered that people cared too much about the sport to see it compromised -- especially the ones who are counting on a fair game when they bet on the outcome			2
finally , when the lockout ended , commissioner @entity183 had no choice but to apologize to the fans			2
" obviously , when you go through something like this , it is painful for everybody , " @entity183 said			0
" most importantly , it is painful for our fans			0
we are sorry to have to put our fans through that , but it is something that in the short term you sometimes have to do to make sure you get the right kind of deal for the long - term and make sure you continue to grow the game			1
most of all : refs are n't so bad after all			2
it was amazing , really			0
@entity205 , the most universally disliked group of people in @entity52 , became quite popular			0
players all but begged for them to return			0
fans railed against the @entity50 owners and @entity183 for locking them out in the first place			1
@entity212 , perhaps the most identifiable referee thanks to his impressive biceps , became a trending topic on @entity117			0
it was @entity212 who , in an attempt to keep he and his fellow refs fresh during the lockout , would hold conference calls every tuesday night where they would discuss how hypothetical situations are enforced			1
one of those calls , of course , dealt with simultaneous possession			2
there likely will be some rust to shake off , but even a few mistakes wo n't change this : finally , there seems to be a national acceptance that it takes a great deal of experience , knowledge and poise to officiate games in this complicated and brutal sport			0
" the pressure on the replacement refs was becoming too much for them , and all of the missed and blown calls were messing with the integrity of the game , " @entity47 linebacker @entity241 said			1
" i 'm not saying the real refs will get every call right , but i think they will do a better job			0
good to have them back			0
" of course , nobody -- including the returning refs -- expected it to last very long			0
they might have gotten that standing ovation before the game , but less than three minutes into the game in @entity4 , fans booed when a call went against the hometown @entity4			1
which , of course , was exactly how it should be .			0

@entity50 officials will work this weekend 's games following the lockout
the refs were cheered when they returned for thursday night 's @entity5 - @entity4 game
replacement officials blew several calls in season 's first three weeks
fan and media outrage may have *contributed* to the lockout being settled
