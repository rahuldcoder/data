@entity0 -- as you have probably noticed , human beings will sometimes do dumb things			2
like step onto someone else 's property late at night or in the early morning hours , whether innocently or not so innocently			1
but that does n't give other people license to overreact and use deadly force to kill an unarmed trespasser			1
the law of man says so but so does the code of common decency			0
still , when a tragedy occurs , those who grieve over the loss of loved ones are sure to find little comfort in the fact that the person who caused their pain is condemned , tried and punished			0
that 's why the goal should be to avoid such unfortunate occurrences in the first place			1
which brings us to @entity32 , and a story with blame to go around and no happy ending			1
my son is only 7 , but someday i 'd like him to have the experience of studying abroad			0
of course , i want him to be safe			0
so when the time comes , i 'll be sure to give him some basic tips on how to stay out of harm 's way			1
such as : always be aware of your surroundings and be cautious around strangers			0
do n't stay out after midnight or venture into parts of a city with which you 're not familiar			1
do n't flash money or otherwise draw attention to yourself			1
now it seems i must add one more item to the list : do n't break into someone 's home , especially late at night or in the early morning hours			1
it 's rude , because you 're a guest in someone else 's country			1
it 's wrong , because you have to respect another person 's property			1
it 's probably against the law , no matter what country you 're in			1
it could also be dangerous			0
if the homeowner catches you and feels the least bit threatened , he might do whatever he feels is necessary to protect himself , his home and his family			1
you could get hurt or even worse			0
consider what happened to @entity78 , a 17 - year - old @entity79 exchange student who was fatally shot at a private residence in @entity81 , @entity32			1
@entity78 was shot by 29 - year - old homeowner @entity82 after the teenager did something he should not have done : wandered uninvited into @entity82 's garage in the early morning hours			1
the garage door was open , and -- according to the criminal complaint that has since been filed against @entity88 for deliberate homicide -- his companion , @entity90 , intentionally left her purse out in plain view " so that they would take it			0
" she also installed sensors and a video monitor so the couple could keep tabs on what was going on in the garage			0
by " they , " @entity90 appeared to mean whomever happened to come along and fall into the trap			2
she told police that the couple had been burglarized twice in the past several weeks , and they were fed up			0
they wanted to catch someone in the act			0
according to the complaint , @entity82 -- a @entity111 firefighter -- told police that he saw images on the video monitor , grabbed his shotgun and fired four times into the garage			0
@entity78 was shot , taken to the hospital and later died from what police describe as serious injuries to his head and arm			0
@entity78 had no business in that garage			0
if he had never entered it , he 'd be alive today			0
and yet @entity88 is no hero			0
this was no spontaneous act of self - defense			2
the homeowner was on the equivalent of a hunting trip			2
he laid a trap , and then waited for someone to walk into it			2
in fact , according to the complaint , @entity82 told the woman who cuts his hair that he had been burglarized before and that he was staying up late at night " just waiting to shoot some ( expletive ) kid			0
" the more you read about this story , the less sympathetic @entity82 becomes			0
he sounds like a crime victim who turned into a vigilante who was just waiting to mete out his own punishment on the next person he perceived as wronging him			0
but he 's the one who is in the wrong			1
so far , we have at least two people behaving badly			0
care to make it three ? @entity155 is the dead teenager 's grieving father			1
he told a @entity79 news agency that the culprit in this tragedy was the gun culture in the @entity161			1
" @entity161 can not continue to play cowboy , " @entity155 said			1
the way the father sees it , his son was killed for simply trespassing on someone 's property			1
the punishment did n't fit the crime , he insists			2
he 's right about that			2
even if @entity78 entered the garage with the intent of stealing something as opposed to simply snooping around , he still did n't deserve to die for the transgression			2
the homeowner obviously got carried away			2
and , if convicted , he should spend the rest of his life in prison because of it			0
but the father is wrong to blame the @entity161 gun culture			1
that 's a sweeping generalization			2
and , as an outsider , he should tread more lightly			0
not every @entity161 owns a gun			1
the issue is n't guns or cowboys			2
nor is the issue those notorious " stand your ground " laws			0
@entity82 's defense lawyers say they will invoke @entity32 's so - called castle doctrine , which allows use of force to ward off unlawful entry of a home if the person reasonably believes it necessary to stop an assault or prevent a felony			1
those responsible might also include @entity155 , the boy 's father			1
after all , someone apparently raised this young man to believe it was fine to trespass on a stranger 's home			2
was it society , his peer group or his parents ? what happened in @entity32 was a terrible occurrence but one that could have been avoided if three people had behaved differently and made better choices .			0

homeowner sets trap , and a 17 - year - old from @entity79 is killed
@entity225 says the homeowner deserves *prosecution* for his actions
he says it was wrong for the youth to be in the house , but that does n't excuse shooter
@entity225 : slain youth 's father is wrong to blame @entity161 for " cowboy " culture
