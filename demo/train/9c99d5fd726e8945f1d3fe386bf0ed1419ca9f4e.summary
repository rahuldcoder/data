@entity0 -- @entity4 archaeologists have discovered an ancient @entity6 bathhouse that was probably used by the soldiers who destroyed the @entity8 in @entity0 , the @entity2 announced monday			1
the surprise discovery includes the mark of @entity12 's @entity11 -- as well as the paw print of a dog			1
the animal probably belonged to one of the soldiers , excavation director @entity15 said			0
the print " could have happened accidentally or have been intended as a joke , " he said			0
archaeologists were not expecting to find the @entity6 structure in the @entity23 , where a mikvah , or @entity26 ritual bath , was being constructed			2
" the mark of the soldiers of the @entity11 , in the form of the stamped impressions on the roof tiles and the in situ mud bricks , bears witness to the fact that they were the builders of the structure , " he said			1
" it seems that the bathhouse was used by these soldiers who were garrisoned there after suppressing the @entity42 uprising in 135 ce ( @entity43 ) , when the pagan city @entity45 was established , " he explained			0
the structure includes a number of plastered bathtubs in the side of a pool , a pipe used to fill it with water , and a white industrial mosaic pavement on the floor			0
hundreds of terra cotta roof tiles were found on the floors of the pool , indicating it was a covered structure , he added			0
the bathhouse tiles are stamped with the symbols of the @entity11 " @entity62 " -- @entity63 , he said			0
the discovery shows that the @entity6 encampment established to help keep @entity4 under @entity6 domination was larger than previously thought , another expert said			1
" despite the very extensive archaeological excavations that were carried out in the @entity23 , so far not even one building has been discovered there that belonged to the roman legion , " @entity0 district archaeologist @entity68 said			2
" the absence of such a find led to the conclusion that @entity45 , the @entity6 city which was established after the destruction of @entity0 , was small and limited in area , " he said			1
but the discovery of the 1,800 - year - old bathhouse " together with other discoveries of recent years , shows that the city was considerably larger than what we previously estimated , " he said			2
understanding the ancient @entity6 city of @entity45 is " extremely valuable , " he said , because it determined the shape of @entity0 's historic walls " and the location of the gates to this very day			1

the surprise discovery shows the ancient @entity6 encampment was bigger than thought
it includes tiles stamped with the mark of the legion that destroyed the @entity8
