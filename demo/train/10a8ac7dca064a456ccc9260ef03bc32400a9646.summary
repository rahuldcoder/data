deep in the remote deserts of southern @entity2 , not far from the border with @entity4 , lies @entity5 one of the world 's most stunning natural wonders			1
nicknamed the @entity10 of the @entity11 , the rugged desert area covers 720 square kilometers and comprises geographical wonders from narrow gorges to towering cliffs and massive caverns			1
it has provided a backdrop for science - fiction films like " @entity19 , " starring @entity20 , and @entity22 's " @entity21			0
" but perhaps the most famous foreigner to traverse through @entity5 , and put this desert on the world map , was @entity27 army officer @entity26			1
imortalized by @entity28 in the 1962 movie " @entity29 " , fittingly parts of the @entity32 classic were filmed in the area			1
but long before @entity32 celebrities and tourists descended on this @entity36 , its red sands have , for centuries , been the home of nomadic @entity42 shepherds			1
with scorching sunshine by day , cold winds at night and little to no water , the @entity42 ' desert life has been all about survival			1
" most people believe that the @entity42 are living a romantic life , but in fact , it is a very tough life , " says @entity48 , @entity2 's tourism expert			1
hundreds of thousands of foreigners visit @entity5 each year			2
they hire either a four - wheel drive vehicle or a camel to explore the government - protected desert			0
some stay overnight in @entity42 camps , where they can enjoy traditional @entity42 meals			1
famed for their hospitality , the @entity42 often invite visitors to their tent homes to share mint tea or cardamom coffee , while sitting by the fire under a starry night sky			2
@entity42 life in @entity5 is increasingly intertwined with the tourism business			1
@entity72 , 45 , works as a tour guide and runs a camp for visitors			0
at his camp site , @entity72 often prepares home - cooked traditional dishes , like zarb , marinated sheep cooked under the desert sand -- the so - called " sand oven " -- for his guests			2
it is prepared fresh , with the meat sourced from @entity87 's own flock of sheep			0
" you need to choose younger sheep , or young goats , " he says			0
" the meat is softer than old sheep			0
" @entity72 's forefathers were among the tribesmen who fought along @entity26 in the 1916 - 1918 @entity96 against the @entity97			2
but today 's bedouins are facing a new battle : preserving their culture and identity			0
young boys , like @entity72 's son @entity103 , prefer playing video games to tending camels and hunting , much to the chagrin of the older generation			0
but @entity72 insists the 10 - year - old should learn the ways of the desert			0
" if children grow up in the city , you sometimes find them soft , " he says			0
" and @entity42 like the boys to be strong for the desert			2
