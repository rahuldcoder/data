@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's president said monday that conditions must improve in the country 's mining industry , just days after 33 miners were rescued from a collapsed mineshaft at a copper mine in the country 's remote @entity11			1
the miners spent 69 days trapped in a shelter almost a half a mile underground before rescuers were able to reach them by drilling a hole wide enough to send a rescue capsule down			2
" we can not guarantee that another accident will never occur in the future , " @entity4 president @entity21 told @entity2 's @entity22 during a visit to @entity24 to meet @entity25 and prime minister @entity26			1
" but we have learned our lesson and we are revising and changing our relations , our procedures			0
" a dangerous life for @entity4 miners he added that as a member of the @entity36 ( @entity36 ) -- a forum of nations with a focus on helping governments tackle the economic , social and governance challenges of a globalized economy -- @entity4 's new rules would be compatible with international standards			1
" we will make sure they are enforced in the field because that 's where it is important , " he said			0
" and not only in the mining sector ; we are revising our standards in many other sectors in order to guarantee that we are doing our best in terms of protecting lives , health , and integrity of our workers			0
" @entity21 also described how , as the eyes of the world were fixed on @entity4 at the start of the dramatic story , he was coming to terms with personal tragedy			1
as news emerged of the 33 miners trapped a half mile under @entity4 's @entity11 when the @entity73 gold and copper mine collapsed , the president 's father - in - law was gravely ill. days and nights were passing without any indication of the state of the men but @entity21 spent the night of august 21 at the hospital , at his wife 's side			1
his father - in - law told him : " do n't give up searching			1
" they were his last words			0
@entity21 's wife encouraged her husband to immediately go to the mine			1
something , she said , will happen today			0
@entity21 arrived at the mine near @entity92 to a handwritten message sent up by the miners through a probe			1
" estamos bien , " it said			0
@entity21 carries a copy of the message in his pocket always			1
" it was an explosion of joy , happiness , tears all over the country , and i think all over the world , " @entity21 said monday , recounting the mine ordeal to @entity2 's @entity102 during a visit to the @entity24			1
it would be many weeks before a dramatic rescue would hoist all 33 miners to safety			0
the entire world watched , families rejoiced and @entity21 emerged with a burnished image			1
he has been smiling in relief since last week 's rescue but on august 5 , the day the mine caved in , the burden of life for the 33 miners rested on @entity21 's shoulders			1
" the private company that owns the mine was not able to undertake the search and rescue , " @entity21 told @entity2			1
" so it was either us , the government , or nobody			0
" so @entity21 launched a blind search , against all odds			1
he said he held onto " profound conviction " and his faith in @entity134			1
" i feel that their families were so convinced that they were alive that each time i went to visit them at the mine during those 17 days of anguish , i was reinforced in our convictions that they were alive , " @entity21 said			2
" i had a kind of inner voice that told me , keep searching , keep searching , do n't give up			0
" he recalled when the energy secretary told him about three possible technologies that could be used in the rescue			0
which one should they use ? @entity21 's thought was : all of them			1
" the machines can fail			0
we can not fail , " @entity21 said			2
then on day number 69 , @entity154 became the first miner to make the long journey upward and step out of the rescue capsule			2
" i will never forget that moment , " @entity21 said			1
" it was so , so overwhelming			0
" @entity21 bear - hugged him			1
as he did all the others , all the way to number 33 , @entity164 , the shift foreman who chose to be the last out			0
@entity166 told @entity21 : " i am handing the ship over to you			2
" @entity21 replied : " you have been a very good chief			2
because you never abandoned your ship until all your men were safe			0
you were the last one			0
that was your duty and i 'm so proud for that			0
" @entity21 has been credited for his leadership ; for his media savvy -- he used to own @entity178 -- and even for what some are calling a badly needed new image for @entity4			2
in @entity1 , @entity21 alluded to the speech delivered by @entity183 when he first became prime minister in 1940			2
" i have nothing to offer but blood , toil , tears and sweat , " @entity183 said			0
" and it was similar that we have the same motivation , faith , and commitment , " @entity21 said			2
" therefore , we kept searching			0
" and i think that the lessons that we can take from this accident is when a country is united and committed with faith , with hope , using the best possible technologies and the best possible human teams , we are able to achieve goals that for some people seems as impossible , " he said .			0

@entity21 's father - in - law 's last words were to not give up the search
he died on the same day the miners were discovered
@entity21 says he held onto profound conviction
he will never forget the moment the first miner came up
