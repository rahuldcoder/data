@entity2 the horrific twin attacks in @entity1 last week have sent shockwaves throughout @entity5			1
political leaders from across the @entity7 joined millions of @entity9 mourners on sunday , and @entity10 - at - large continue to pay tribute with public vigils , flowers and candles , and minutes of silence			2
yet this outpouring of solidarity must not obscure another response across the continent			0
leaders of @entity5 's far - right have been quick to blame @entity23 and immigration , mosques have been defaced in @entity9 and elsewhere , and a xenophobic movement called " patriotic @entity10 against the @entity26 " brought tens of thousands to the streets of @entity28 this week			1
this extreme strand of @entity10 publics and politics will likely receive a boost from the @entity9 tragedy			0
anti-immigration and @entity36 sentiments have been on a steady rise in @entity5 for years			2
while a majority of @entity10 appreciates mobility and migration within the @entity7 , they are largely negative about immigration from outside of the @entity7 , according to the latest @entity45 survey			0
this opposition is particularly pronounced towards @entity48 immigrants			2
half and more of all @entity10 view @entity23 as incompatible with the western world , while @entity23 is seen as an outright threat by between one - third of all @entity52 and almost two - thirds of all @entity54 , according to a recent @entity56 study			1
holders of such views will surely see the @entity1 attacks as confirmation ; many others may now question their hitherto more moderate opinions			1
it is these sentiments , along with fears over economic prospects , aversion to the political establishment and doubts in the @entity10 project , that populist and typically far - right parties have successfully tapped in recent years			0
virtually every @entity7 country has seen the rise of such a political force , and their combined representation in the @entity77 has shot up to 20 % in last year 's elections			0
for these parties , the @entity1 attacks truly are a " told - you - so " moment			1
@entity81 of the @entity82 blamed " a fifth column within our countries , " while @entity83 of the @entity84 in the @entity85 claimed that it was time to " de-islamize our country			0
" @entity91 of the @entity9 @entity92 urged that " time 's up for denial and hypocrisy , " and @entity100 of the @entity101 saw all those proven wrong who had ignored the @entity96 threat			0
sadly , these slogans are more likely than ever before now to resonate with @entity10 publics			0
this combination of a considerable portion of @entity10 that are skeptical of , if not outright hostile to , @entity48 and migrants , and the ever more aggressive rhetoric of the populist far - right puts a massive pressure on @entity5 's politics and societies alike			1
first and foremost , @entity5 's @entity48 communities are likely to suffer			1
although in their overwhelming majority , they are integrated and identify with @entity5 , blanket suspicion against @entity23 , resentments in day - to - day life , and assaults on their community are bound to increase and deepen fear and alienation among @entity48			1
this will feed segregation among @entity48 and @entity125 communities , and provide a fertile ground for the radicalization of some young @entity48			1
in short , @entity10 @entity48 are at risk of being driven away from mainstream @entity10 societies			2
secondly , the political climate and culture in @entity5 will change			2
under attack from extremists , whether in parliament or in the streets , mainstream political parties will be tempted to move away from their typically centered , whether somewhat to the left or right , positions			0
politics will move to tighten immigration laws , select highly - skilled migrants over refugees from war zones , push for their greater assimilation , and install additional security measures			2
as a result , further liberties of @entity10 citizens are likely to be sacrificed as political establishments try to preempt a further growth of extremist parties			0
this is a slippery slope , as radicals will quickly produce the next phobia that they demand to be addressed			1
thirdly , this changing climate and politics will also impact on migration and migrants broadly , beyond @entity48			2
already there have been fierce debates to limit @entity161 migration , whether hurdles to @entity164 and @entity165 @entity10 after their countries joined the @entity7 , or restrictions on social benefits @entity7 citizens can draw across borders			0
much as these debates are already taking their toll on some of @entity5 's poorest , such as the @entity172 , future approaches to immigration to the @entity7 will likely exclude some of the world 's most underprivileged , such as asylum - seekers			1
@entity5 will become even more of a reality			0
@entity5 can still stem this dangerous trend			0
millions of @entity9 people , of all origins and faiths , have given a powerful example of unity , openness and inclusiveness last week , as have tens of thousands of pro-tolerance and pro-immigration marchers in @entity28 this week			0
it is now also on @entity5 's political class to resolutely refute the many " told - you - so 's " on the continent			1
read : attack will empower @entity5 's far right			1

leaders of @entity5 's far - right have been quick to blame @entity23 and immigration for the @entity1 attacks
