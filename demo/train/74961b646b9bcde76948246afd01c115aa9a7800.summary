@entity0 -- senate majority leader @entity2 put proposed gun legislation on pause thursday , setting it aside for now after the defeat a day earlier of major provisions sought by president @entity7 and @entity8 in the aftermath of the @entity11 school massacre			1
the move emphasized the solid victory for the @entity14 and its conservative @entity16 allies in what @entity7 called " round one " of the fight for tougher gun laws			1
it also shifted the gun debate from details of particular proposals to political sniping by both sides in an attempt to generate public support on the divisive issue			2
" the next stage is blame avoidance , " noted @entity30 , the vice president and director of governance studies at the @entity32			0
" each side will seek to blame the other for the failure to address this important problem			0
" in announcing his temporary shelving of the gun legislation , @entity2 criticized republicans for orchestrating wednesday 's defeat of expanded background checks on gun buyers , a top priority of @entity7 and @entity8 that national polls show is supported by about 90 % of @entity46			1
he said @entity7 agreed with him that " the best way to keep working towards passing a background check bill is to hit pause and freeze the background check bill where it is			0
" " this debate is not over , " the @entity53 @entity52 declared on the @entity55 floor , adding that the @entity16 opposition to expanded background checks was " not sustainable " in the face of public support for the measure			1
on wednesday , @entity7 angrily accused @entity55 @entity16 of doing the @entity14 's bidding in opposing a bipartisan compromise that would expand background checks for private transactions at gun shows and all internet sales			1
in unusually harsh language , he accused the @entity14 and its allies of spreading lies about the compromise drafted by @entity8 sen. @entity72 of @entity73 and @entity74 sen. @entity74 of @entity75 as part of a campaign to defeat it			0
a litany of supporters of tougher gun laws also condemned @entity16 on thursday , including a group of mayors led by @entity84 's @entity83 and former rep. @entity85 , who was seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting attack			1
conservative @entity16 sen. @entity87 of @entity88 responded thursday by condemning @entity7 for taking " the low road " in the debate			1
speaking on the @entity55 floor , @entity87 tried to position @entity16 as the ones seeking new gun laws by challenging @entity2 and @entity8 to work with them instead of putting the measure aside			1
he also sought to distance himself from the gun lobby , declaring he worked for the citizens of @entity88 rather than the @entity14 and insisting that " those of us who did not agree with the president 's proposals are not being intimidated			0
" " it 's absolutely false to say it comes down to politics , " @entity87 said			2
after the @entity55 voted down a series of amendments wednesday , including watered - down measures to expand background checks and ban some semi-automatic firearms , it passed two amendments thursday to the bill @entity2 later shelved			1
one was a @entity16 plan to protect the privacy of gun owners while the other was a bipartisan proposal to strengthen mental health programs			1
the decision by @entity2 indicated that he wants to see if calls for increased public pressure can influence more republicans to defy the @entity14 , which scores legislators on their voting records and seeks to influence election campaigns involving candidates it supports or opposes			2
wednesday 's votes showed the challenge @entity8 face			0
the compromise on expanded background checks forged by @entity72 and @entity74 , both with a-rated voting records from the @entity14 , failed on a 54 - 46 vote			0
it needed 60 votes to pass under an agreement reached by @entity55 leaders that applied to all the amendments			2
four republicans broke from the @entity14 's position to support the background check plan , while four @entity8 from pro-gun states offset them by opposing it			0
@entity2 also voted " no " in a procedural move giving him the ability to reintroduce his party 's top priority for a gun package at a later date			1
in other votes wednesday , @entity16 proposals received stronger support			1
for example , a proposal by @entity87 that would have made state permits to carry concealed weapons acceptable throughout the country failed on a 57 - 43 vote			2
to @entity158 , the daughter of the principal of the @entity11 , @entity161 , school who was killed along with 20 first - graders and five other educators in the december attack , the @entity55 result amounted to inaction in the face of a national tragedy			2
" the next time there 's a mass shooting and they 're asked what they did to prevent it , they 're going to have to say nothing , " she said			0
on the other side , the @entity14 's @entity177 called the expanded background check proposal " misguided , " saying it would not reduce violent crime " or keep our kids safe in their schools			0
" in the @entity184 , some @entity8 and @entity16 are proposing a measure similar to the @entity72 - @entity74 compromise defeated by the @entity55			1
while its chances appear remote , based on the chamber 's @entity16 majority , @entity7 and @entity8 urged people to insist that their elected leaders pass the background check measure that has strong public support			2
" you need to let your representatives in @entity196 know that you are disappointed , and if they do n't act this time , you will remember come election time , " @entity7 said			0
@entity16 opponents of the new gun laws parroted the @entity14 position that expanding background checks would be a step toward a national gun registry and eventual federal confiscation of firearms , a claim that @entity7 and sponsors of the compromise called false			1
some opponents argued the language of the compromise would burden law - abiding gun owners seeking to sell their guns privately over the @entity215			0
@entity87 and others called for a more limited bill that would focus on keeping guns out of the hands of criminals and people adjudicated as mentally ill , rather than seeking to expand background checks beyond current limits			0
democrats responded that such an argument was contradictory , because the expanded background checks would prevent criminals and the mentally ill from obtaining firearms			0
" it 's inconceivable to me that someone could believe that you can keep guns away from criminals and the dangerously mentally ill without at a minimum having a background check , " said rep. @entity228 of @entity229 , who was leading the @entity8 gun law effort in the @entity184			0
the debate over gun laws is not going away , according to @entity30 , the @entity32 analyst			1
" i expect this issue to remain on the public agenda , " he said , " because shootings happen all the time and large numbers still favor tougher background checks			0
