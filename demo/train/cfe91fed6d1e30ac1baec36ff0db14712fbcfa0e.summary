-- regular readers of @entity0 know that we have done a series of stories on the development and increasing popularity of cars that run -- or will eventually run -- on alternative fuels			2
the mandatory use of @entity10 in public service vehicles began in @entity12 , @entity13 in 2000			1
we 've written about hybrids , clean - diesel engines , fuel - cell technology , ethanol and more			1
that brings us to another entry in the auto industry 's ongoing research and development of green - technology : compressed natural gas ( @entity10 )			1
scientists are trying to determine which alternative fuel will best strike a balance between being environmentally friendly and commercial viability			1
@entity10 might be the answer			1
vehicles running on @entity10 have actually been around since the early 1990s , but have not been a dominant force in the marketplace mostly because the infrastructure ( i.e. re-fueling stations ) is not yet in place to support high - volume sales of @entity10 - powered cars			1
presently , there are only about 1,600 @entity10 refueling stations in the @entity40 , compared with up to 200,000 gas stations			1
currently there is only one @entity10 - powered model sold on the consumer market that is actually manufactured as a @entity10 - powered car			1
that 's the @entity47 , which boasts an @entity49 - estimated fuel economy of 24/36 miles per gasoline - gallon equivalent			1
@entity51 autos : best hybrids @entity54 , president of @entity55 for @entity40 said there are other natural - gas - powered vehicles on the road -- about 130,000 , he estimates -- but that the vast majority of those are part of commercial or transit fleets or have been converted from gasoline - powered cars			1
" they 're mostly fleet vehicles , like transit buses , delivery trucks , and the fleets maintained by the gas company , the electric company , etc , " he said			2
" we do n't have hard figures about conversions , but i 'd bet that about 25 percent of those 130,000 were once gasoline - powered vehicles that have been converted to @entity10 vehicles , " @entity54 said			1
" there are a growing number of companies making certified conversion systems and installing them			0
" @entity79 maintains a list of certified conversion systems on its web site : @entity84			0
@entity51 autos : fuel - efficient used cars some of those 130,000 are also natural - gas - powered vehicles manufactured and sold by @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 back in the early ' 90s , he says -- back when the @entity40 manufacturers were still in the business of making @entity10 - powered cars			1
but we 'll get back to that later			0
but with the price of gasoline currently averaging over $ 4 a gallon nationally , @entity54 predicts there will be more and more demand for @entity10 - powered vehicles like the @entity47			1
" i went to a conference a couple of months ago , and every manufacturer we talked to said that their phones were ringing off the hook , from people who are saying they 'd be interested in buying a @entity10 - powered car , " @entity54 said			1
" and there are more and more people and companies who want to get into the conversion business			0
" @entity51 autos : hybrid @entity116 the cost of conversions varies by the type of vehicle , @entity54 noted			0
" but most cost in the $ 10,000 range			0
most conversion systems are certified for @entity90 and @entity92 models , among others , " he said			0
on the financial side , natural gas is about 30 percent less expensive than gasoline when it is purchased at a refueling station			1
it 's about 50 percent less expensive when you fill ' er up at home , via home refueling appliance that tap into your natural gas line , @entity54 said			1
owners of the @entity47 in @entity137 and @entity138 who have natural gas piped into their homes can purchase the " @entity143 " re-fueling system for about $ 3,500			1
this @entity145 system can be used whether your @entity10 vehicle was manufactured that way or converted , he said			1
@entity51 autos : luxury cars with best gas mileage " the @entity143 is about the size of a pay phone , and you hang it on the garage wall , and vent it like a dryer and plug it into a gas line and also into an electric socket , " @entity54 explained			2
the primary environmental benefit of a @entity10 car is that it produces 90 percent fewer smog - forming pollutants ( oxides of nitrogen ) , compared to the output of a conventional gas engine , said @entity165 , manager of alternative fuels for @entity167 the @entity47 has reaped many environmental awards			1
this year , it was named by the @entity169 ( @entity169 ) as the " greenest vehicle in the nation -- for the fifth consecutive year			0
" the gx , which was first introduced in 1998 , has the cleanest internal combustion certified by the @entity49 , @entity165 noted			0
@entity51 autos : most - popular fuel - efficient cars the @entity47 is not a high - volume vehicle in terms of sales			1
@entity165 said annual sales have fluctuated between 500 to 1000 units a year since it was rolled out , with sales of 1,100 units last year			0
he expects that to go up in 2008			0
for comparison purposes , about 40,000 @entity184 were sold last year , with sales of 48,000 anticipated for this year			2
most of the sales of the @entity47 are concentrated in southern @entity138 , followed by @entity189 and @entity190 -- primarily because those markets are where many of the 1,600 re-fueling stations are presently located			2
" as the infrastructure builds up , we 'll sell more of them in other markets , " @entity165 predicted			0
" right now , this is a car that people use regionally			0
if you live here in @entity202 , you can drive to @entity203 and back and not worry about being able to find a refueling station			2
as for cost , the @entity47 natural - gas vehicle is priced at about $ 24,500 , compared to $ 17,000 for a comparably - equipped @entity207 , @entity165 said -- except that buyers get a $ 4,000 tax credit on the purchase of the gx			1
and until recently , @entity138 buyers got an additional $ 3,000 rebate from the @entity214			0
" but the program was so popular , they are out of funds , and looking to add more money to the coffer so they can continue with the rebates , " @entity165 said			0
" but people who buy a @entity47 , when we ask them about the math , in term of comparing those two civics , they sort of give us blank stares , " @entity165 continued			0
" most of these folks who are buying the @entity47 are trying to get out of having to commute to work every day in a pick - up truck , @entity116 or even a passenger car that 's only getting 15 or 20 miles a gallon			0
and they 're also the same kind of people who 've said they 'd pay $ 25 or $ 50 a week to be able to drive in the car - pool lane			0
" interestingly , many of the automakers , like @entity239 , @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245 , do produce @entity10 - powered vehicles for other countries , said @entity79 's @entity54 , who noted that " about 1.5 million of the natural gas vehicles have been sold in @entity249 , another 1.5 million in @entity250 , another 1.5 million in @entity251 , and so on			1
" and , once upon a time , in the early ' 90s , @entity40 automakers did sell @entity10 vehicles in the @entity40			1
" but the federal government kept adding more loopholes to the energy policy that was supposed to encourage the increased manufacture and sales of @entity10 vehicles , " @entity54 said			2
" then the government opted not to expand the coverage of the program the way the law allowed -- or the way the automakers expected			0
without that demand pull , the @entity40 automakers did n't believe they could sell enough of them here			2
" " @entity40 automakers zigged when they probably should have zagged " added @entity269			2
" they turned their backs on @entity10 and began to focus on bio-fuels			2
" but , noted @entity165 , " we 're definitely keeping our stake in the @entity10 business , because we know we can add it to other platforms			2
we used to think of the @entity47 as ' @entity277 ' -- you know , saying , ' i think i can , i think i can ' in terms of becoming more commercially viable			0
" but , with gas prices going up and up , now we 're thinking more along the lines of ' i know i can , i know i can			0
' and more and more people are genuinely interested in going more green because of the environmental impact , " he said			0
" a lot of people got into the hybrids , and then , after a while , began to ask , ' how can i do more ? ' and they 're looking to natural - gas - powered cars as the answer to that			1
" so , we 're in this for the long haul , " noted @entity165 , who said the company is definitely looking to do bigger business and make a profit from the gx			0
" now , it 's just a matter of society continuing to change , and to continue to become more environmentally - minded			0
as they do , we think there will be increasing interest in @entity10 , and we 'll see a shift in emphasis toward @entity10 and away from bio-fuels			2

scientists trying to determine which alternative fuel is best for *future*
some say compressed natural gas could be the answer
only only one @entity10 - powered model sold on the consumer market today
about 1,600 @entity10 refueling stations in @entity40 , compared to 200,000 gas stations
