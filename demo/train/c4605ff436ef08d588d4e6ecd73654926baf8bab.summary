-- @entity2 @entity1 have been forced to close a potential loophole on their much - touted insider trading law -- a loophole @entity0 uncovered and reported about last month			1
because of @entity0 's report , the @entity5 and @entity2 passed new legislation thursday to close the loophole that could have allowed family members of some lawmakers to profit from inside information			1
senators who were critical of the loophole after it was unearthed applauded the fix			0
the @entity16 , one of the rare bipartisan bills passed this year , was signed by president @entity19 in april			1
@entity19 signs @entity16 to address ' deficit of trust ' in @entity21 lawmakers proclaimed that the bill , officially called the @entity16 , would restore trust in government			1
it also applied new rules to some employees of the executive branch			0
but @entity0 discovered the law that members of @entity32 thought they voted for earlier this year was n't exactly as advertised			2
the stock act requires that any trades of $ 1,000 or more made on or after july 3 have to be reported to the @entity2 and @entity5 within 45 days			1
but the @entity2 and @entity5 came out with two completely different interpretations of that rule			1
in the @entity5 , the @entity37 released one page of guidelines in june ruling that members and their spouses and dependent children all have to file reports after they make stock or securities trades			1
its 14 - page memo released in june found that @entity2 members and aides covered by the law that their spouses and children were not covered			2
the @entity52 , which oversees all federal executive branch employees , sided with the @entity2 , informing its employees that their spouses and children do n't need to file these periodic reports			2
both of the lead sponsors of the @entity5 bill did n't realize the discrepancy until @entity0 brought it to their attention last month			1
@entity62 @entity1 @entity61 , the only @entity1 senator to attend the @entity2 signing ceremony , said he was " obviously very concerned			2
" " say i find out some information , i tell my wife and she goes and trades on it , what 's the difference ? " @entity61 told @entity0			1
@entity61 , who speaks constantly about this bill in his neck - and - neck race for re-election against consumer advocate @entity73 , said the whole point of passing the law was to demonstrate that members of @entity32 were n't held to a different standard			0
@entity5 race in a dead heat " i mean , bottom line , we 're supposed to have that level of transparency and have us be treated like every other member of the @entity86 and bottom line , if we ca n't do it , then -- sorry , if they ca n't do it -- then we should n't be able to do it as well			1
" sen. @entity92 , d - @entity93 , also criticized the @entity2 decision not to include congressional spouses and children when the loophole was brought to her attention			1
" i think it 's wrong , and i think it 's unfortunate because the reality is the whole point of this legislation is we should play by the exact same rules as every other @entity86 citizen , and when all of @entity86 looks at @entity21 , they know it 's broken			0
" " we 're trying to restore just a small measure of confidence through this kind of transparency and accountability , " @entity92 said			0
after @entity0 told @entity61 about the @entity2 interpretation , @entity61 fired off a letter to his @entity1 colleagues in the @entity2 , speaker @entity117 and @entity2 majority leader @entity118			1
" the @entity2 interpretation leaves a loophole and the appearance of an ongoing double standard , " @entity61 said in the letter			2
" it is deeply troubling that the @entity127 and @entity128 would attempt to operate under a substantially weaker interpretation than the @entity5 , " he added , demanding that the @entity2 adopt the @entity5 's view and require all spouses and dependents to begin reporting stock trades			1
why was there a difference ? @entity132 , a @entity21 ethics attorney and former chief counsel for both the @entity2 and @entity134 , explained that the @entity5 bill did include a provision that covered spouses and children , but when @entity118 's office wrote the @entity2 version , this language was shifted to a different section of the bill			1
the change meant that spouses and dependent children were n't subject to the new reporting requirements			0
" @entity127 recrafted some of the provisions of it and moved some of the provisions around			0
in that process , some of the @entity5 bill that applied to filing of these new reports was moved from one section of the bill to the other , " @entity132 said			2
the @entity158 decided to stick with the spirit of the law that senators originally intended , but the @entity37 went with the letter of the law , which included the loophole not requiring spouses and children to report financial transactions in a timely fashion			0
more @entity32 : no aid for farmers amid drought why did it matter ? the loophole went to the heart of what the @entity16 set out to do			2
while there were already laws in place barring members of @entity32 or the executive branch from profiting from nonpublic information that they learn in the course of their duties , it was extremely difficult for those at the @entity187 to enforce those laws			0
the financial disclosure forms @entity2 members and senators were already required to file only come out once a year , making it tough to track any relationship between legislative action and a stock trade			2
that 's why the @entity16 added the rule that after each trade over $ 1,000 a report had to be filed in a timely manner			0
@entity132 stressed the new law provides " more immediacy , more real time so that the public could have more real - time understanding of what their members , of their senior staff and other high government officials were doing with their finances , what kinds of trades were they making			0
" the chairman of the @entity37 , rep. @entity215 , @entity216 , and the ranking @entity217 , @entity86 rep. @entity214 of @entity218 , defended their committee 's interpretation of the law in a written statement to @entity0 last month			1
" as has been noted by outside experts , the office of @entity227 and various @entity2 offices of expertise , including the @entity230 and the office of general counsel , with whom the @entity37 consulted , the plain language of the @entity16 and the @entity225 is unambiguous and beyond dispute and the @entity37 interpreted it correctly			1
" initially when contacted by @entity0 , @entity118 's office insisted it did nothing to change the intent of the @entity16			1
but when pressed with the new information uncovered by @entity0 , the majority leader 's office conceded it made changes to the @entity2 bill that effectively took out the requirement for spouses and children to file these reports			1
@entity118 's spokesman insisted that the change was unintentional and the majority leader 's office did not believe when they passed their bill that it differed from the @entity5 version			2
" since new information has been brought to our attention with respect to this discrepancy , we are reviewing our options regarding transaction reports in the @entity127 , " @entity252 said at the time			2
still , another question is why the @entity2 changed the legislation in the first place			0
a @entity1 leadership source insists there were no sinister motives , that @entity118 and the broader @entity1 leadership made changes after consulting with @entity37 lawyers			0
in the two weeks since @entity0 's report , @entity118 's office consulted with the @entity5 to determine how they should fix the loophole			1
after consultations with leaders of both parties , new legislation was drafted			0
the two - page bill passed unanimously by both chambers on thursday before @entity32 left @entity21 for their month long summer recess			0
following the change , @entity92 issued a statement applauding it			0
" the intent of this important reform bill was clear from the start , to restore people 's faith in their elected leaders by ensuring we play by the exact same set of rules as every other @entity86			0
including family members in our monthly disclosure requirements was an integral piece of restoring that faith , and i am pleased the @entity2 will finally join the @entity5 in conforming to these important new rules , " said @entity92			1
@entity61 also praised the move to fix the law			0
" i 'm pleased that with today 's legislative action , we 've made sure the @entity2 will follow the @entity158 's lead and implement the law the way it was intended			2
the same rules need to apply across the board -- no matter who you work for			0
" in addition to closing the loophole for spouses and dependent children , the new legislation passed by the @entity2 and @entity5 also made a change that the @entity19 administration requested			1
some administration officials voiced concerns that the ability of foreign governments to view personal financial information about top government employees posed a national security threat			0
to address those concerns , the bill gave executive branch employees a waiver from the requirement to disclose their stock or securities trades until september 30 to allow some additional time to determine the appropriate procedures for those officials			0
