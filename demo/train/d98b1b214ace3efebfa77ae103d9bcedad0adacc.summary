-- @entity2 's central leadership and its ability to direct operations from beyond its base in @entity6 has diminished , but its affiliate organizations , along with other terror groups , have grown more dangerous , according to a new report from the @entity10			1
" the terrorist threat continued to evolve rapidly in 2013 , with an increasing number of groups around the world - including both @entity2 affiliates and other terrorist organizations - posing a threat to the @entity20 , our allies , and our interests , " the annual report on global terrrorism trends found			2
in the report , the @entity10 said ongoing efforts to degrade and eliminate the organization led by @entity28 have " accelerated the decentralization " of @entity2			1
but those steps have led to groups like its affiliate in @entity32 , @entity33 , to take advantage of conditions on the ground to " broaden and deepen their operations , " become more autonomous and focus on their own goals of attacking the @entity20 and other western governments			0
@entity43 has experienced difficulty in commanding influence and ordering directives throughout the group 's affiliate structure , the report said , noting an increase in violent attacks by affiliate groups against civilian populations in their areas of operations			1
in addition to the more deadly attacks , the decentralization of @entity2 has led affiliates to increase their financial independence through increased kidnappings for ransom and criminal activity like extortion and credit card fraud , the report found			1
@entity28 : followers should ' capture @entity66 ' according to the report , @entity2 in @entity32 is among the most lethal of the affiliate groups and " continues to pose the most significant threat to the @entity20 and @entity20 citizens and interests in @entity32			1
" the group 's leader , @entity72 , recently elevated to the no. 2 position in @entity2 's larger network , carried out more than 100 attacks in @entity32 in 2013			1
it continues its focus of directing attacks at the @entity20 homeland like the failed 2009 attempt to take down a jetliner over @entity83 with the " @entity84			0
" the group has been in the crosshairs of the @entity32 government and @entity20 counterterror efforts and was the focus of several military operations against its leadership following the release of a video that showed a large gathering of the group and its senior leadership			0
terror attacks on the rise the report cited 9,707 terrorist attacks in 2013 , a 43 % increase from 2012 , according to statistics compiled by the @entity104 for the @entity105			1
attacks resulted in more than 17,800 deaths and more than 32,500 injuries			1
the majority took place in @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity6 , the @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity32			2
last year 's most lethal incidents were carried out by the @entity120 in both @entity111 and @entity6 , @entity114 's @entity121 , @entity2 in @entity113 , @entity33 , and @entity122 , according to the report			2
@entity125 's impact @entity126 , the @entity10 's top counterterrorism official , said the revelations by @entity125 of classified @entity130 surveillance programs has degraded @entity20 's ability to monitor and prevent terrorist activity			0
" it has done damage to our intelligence efforts and it 's done damage to our ability to ensure that these groups do n't have eyesight on the way that we try and gain intelligence with respect to what they 're doing , " she said			0
" so overall , know , it 's incredibly damaging when we have these kinds of leaks because , at the end of the day , these groups are better able to assess and judge how we obtain our information			0
" @entity117 , @entity113 and @entity152 the civil war in @entity117 , with it 's increasing sectarian nature , also continues to be a magnet with " thousands " of foreign fighters joining violent extremist groups to do battle for or against the regime of @entity117 president @entity160 , the report found			1
it added that @entity2 linked groups , such as @entity164 and the @entity122 , remain a serious threat			0
the @entity113 group , which has had some differences with core @entity2 and @entity43 , was found in the report to have conducted some of the most lethal attacks in the world last year			2
while @entity174 and its @entity176 proxies led by the @entity178 terrorist group @entity177 continue to support the @entity160 regime , many foreign jihadists are traveling to @entity117 to fight with @entity2 - aligned groups like the @entity164			2
a number of governments are concerned those fighters will eventually return to their home countries to carry out attacks of their own			0
next door in @entity113 , a weak security environment in the western section of the country along with the de-stabilizing effects of the situation in @entity117 have allowed a former @entity2 affiliate , the @entity122 , to move across the border with ease to conduct its own attacks			1
terrorist groups operating in ungoverned areas of @entity152 also continue to pose a threat			0
while the report cites operations by @entity201 in @entity152 , and terrorist groups operating in @entity114 , @entity203 and @entity204 , the report also singles out @entity205 as an area of concern and instability			0
" @entity205 's porous borders , the weakness of @entity205 's nascent security institutions , and large amounts of loose small arms create opportunities for violent extremists , " the report said .			0
