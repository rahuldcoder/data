" this crest is very important " said the instructor in @entity8 as @entity2 makes a double fold on the upper edge of the white bedsheets , then carefully tops it with a few pillows			2
it 's not as if @entity2 does n't know how to make a bed that a @entity0 visitor can gleefully climb into after a day --- or night -- out on the town			2
she has already spent five years working at different hotels , but this training is required for her new job this time as a member of the @entity22			1
" they offer really good benefits i did n't have before and the pay is also better , " she said			2
her training takes place at the union 's @entity28 , where job seekers learn everything needed to work on the @entity0 , from loading a dishwasher to vacuuming floors and waiting tables to the finer details of gourmet cooking			1

she says she has had a hard time finding a job since her employment as a census worker ended last year			0
but for @entity2 and @entity66 , their union membership could provide more than a steady job with benefits			0

" we spend almost a full year before the election making sure all of our members are registered to vote , " said @entity71 , the political director for the @entity72			1

as it did in most states , the @entity87 population exploded in @entity49 over the past decade			0
according to the census , 26 % of the more than 2.7 million state residents have @entity48 heritage			0
both parties rolling the dice in @entity49 with the strength in numbers comes political muscle			1
state politicians are locked in a battle to draw new congressional districts that best reflect @entity48 representation			0
@entity102 favor spreading @entity48 into three districts , arguing that would give them more clout in more places			0
republicans , led by gov. @entity108 , want a @entity87 majority district , saying the time has come for @entity111 to have a better chance of sending one of their own to represent them in @entity115			1
