-- @entity1 has at last revealed its long - awaited @entity2 , an 8.9 - inch tablet with capacitive multi-touch and running @entity4			1
the @entity2 , you will remember , was proudly touted by @entity8 's @entity7 as an @entity10 killer , back before the @entity10 even existed			1
so is this an @entity10 competitor ? no freakin ' way			0
the @entity13 is just that , a pc			2
it runs on a @entity17 processor , has @entity18 and a @entity19 , along with a @entity21 accelerator for 1080p video , a usb port , @entity24 - out , a hardware @entity26 switch , a button to activate the on - screen keyboard and a pair of cameras , one on the back for photos and one on the front for skyping			2
it also has , somewhat unbelievably , a slide - out @entity38 license			0
apparently any machine with @entity38 pre-installed needs to show the license info and @entity1 , in order to keep the rear design clean , opted to add a slide - out plastic bar to display it			2
oh , it is also @entity47 only : there 's no 3g radio			1
there is one nice touch : the screen includes a @entity54 digitizer so you can use a stylus to take notes on screen			0
there is nowhere to store the stylus , though , so you 'll lose it soon enough			0
clearly , the @entity2 is to full - featured tablet pcs as a netbook is to a proper notebook : a scaled back , underpowered portable with a too - small screen , running an os designed for the desktop , not a touch - operated device			1
@entity1 has tried to justify the ridiculous price with a disclaimer in its press release , which says it is " designed specifically for business			1
" the problem is , businesses are already buying the @entity10 , which is designed just to be good			0
we 're certainly looking forward to seeing some proper rivals to the @entity10 , with ten - inch screens running an os designed for touch			1
the @entity2 , a netbook with the keyboard missing , ai n't it			0
