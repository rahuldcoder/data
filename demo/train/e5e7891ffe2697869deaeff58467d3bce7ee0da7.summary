-- in an effort to galvanize support for a new pair of rail tunnels connecting @entity8 and @entity3 , two @entity2 senators from the @entity3 announced monday that @entity9 would bear some of the costs			1
the $ 13.5 billion @entity12 project would add high - speed and commuter rail service between the two states by 2020 , replacing an earlier project that @entity3 gov. @entity16 , a @entity17 , rejected after citing budget concerns			1
" @entity3 is facing a transportation crisis , " sen. @entity19 said monday			1
he said residents were " fed up " with train delays and " endless traffic " on @entity3 highways			2
@entity19 joined fellow @entity26 sen. @entity25 and @entity9 president @entity27 at the @entity28 in @entity29 , @entity3 , saying the government - owned rail corporation would spend $ 50 million to begin preliminary engineering and design , according to a press release from @entity19 's office			1
" it is a critical first step that we can take now to bring 220 mph @entity9 high - speed service to the @entity39 , " said @entity27 , according to the release			2
@entity9 was not immediately available to verify the proposed spending plan			0
@entity16 rejected a similar project in october after " no agreement was reached on terms that would assure @entity3 's taxpayers would not pay more than $ 2.7 billion for a completed @entity46 project			1
" " the question is who 's going to pay for it , " said @entity8 mayor @entity47			0
" gov. @entity16 said that there was obligations potentially for the taxpayers of @entity3 that he did n't feel they should shoulder			0
" " that 's his decision to make , " @entity47 added			0
the access to the @entity59 project , also known as the @entity46 project , would have created 6,000 jobs , with federal cost estimates ranging between $ 9.8 billion and $ 12.7 billion			2
@entity19 was among its proponents and led public criticism against the governor 's decision to put the project on hold and ultimately cancel it			2
" the critical difference to @entity46 is that @entity12 will add far less capacity for @entity73 , though still a considerable amount , " said @entity70 , a former director of @entity73 's @entity72 office			0
" the operators would be a lot happier having arc - lite than nothing			0
" but the state also is facing a projected budget gap of $ 10.5 billion for the next fiscal year			1
the @entity3 governor has made deficit reduction a cornerstone of his administration , pushing cuts to education , local governments and mass transit and tackling state pension plans and benefits packages for public - sector workers			1
@entity16 is expected to deliver his annual budget presentation february 22			0
