-- casually warming up on the mat , @entity1 slips into a pose that would leave a contortionist gasping in admiration			1
one leg keeping her upright and the other pointing toward the ceiling , her torso arches back at a mind - boggling angle while her head rests behind the supporting thigh , with both hands on the floor			2
it 's more " matrix " than " @entity21 " -- but there are no special effects here			2
" my dad was rather reluctant to let me do this sport , as he knew how hard it would be , " the 16 - year - old rhythmic gymnastics champion tells @entity0 's human to @entity24			1
@entity29 , in fact , knows all about the rigors of being an international athlete			2
a swimmer , he was part of @entity34 's 4 x 200 meters freestyle relay team that won gold at the @entity37			1
" i got into rhythmic gymnastics when i was four years old			1
my dad brought me there , " @entity1 recalls			1
" he knew my future coach , so when he brought me to meet her , she told him i have to start training			2
" she also convinced my dad that i have to go into gymnastics			2
eventually he let me do the training to improve my flexibility , body posture and body shape			2
as it turned out , this sport has actually become my entire life			2
" and @entity1 has made her father proud			1
this year , while still just 15 , she became the youngest rhythmic gymnast to ever win the all - around title at the @entity51 , in @entity52 in late august			1
rhythmic gymnastics -- " a beautiful and womanly sport , " says @entity1 -- incorporates balls , clubs , hoops and ribbons in its performance			1
" for a gymnast to be successful , she needs to strike a balance of everything within herself			2
she needs to be graceful , flexible , perform all elements , turns , maintain co-ordination -- she has to have all of that			2
" if , for example , she only has co-ordination and nothing else , she will not succeed			0
" the world title was but a small step on the way to her main goal , an @entity73 , and she is quick to reject suggestions that rhythmic gymnastics is not worthy of the @entity77 status it was given in 1984			1
" some of the authorities would like to remove rhythmic gymnastics from the list of @entity82 sports and turn it into art. i think this would be wrong , as rhythmic gymnastics is a true sport -- we train around six hours per day , and sometimes spend entire days in the gym			1
" ask @entity89 which of the four disciplines she prefers , and you will get the kind of look most people would give when told to give up air or water			0
" i love them all and can not lay emphasis on any of them			0
i might offend one of them ! " she retorts			0
that sort of focus comes from years of dedicated training , but @entity1 does not believe she has missed out on a normal childhood			1
" i can not say i sacrificed anything			0
i train for myself , to achieve sports goals , and i do not sacrifice anything , " she says			0
" rhythmic gymnastics is my life , everything i currently need			1
when i am performing , i feel something very special -- something which the audience can never feel			0
" nicknamed the " @entity117 " and famous for her ball - spinning tricks as well as her spectacular ribbon routines , @entity1 is continuing @entity34 's dominance of the sport over the past decade			1
" @entity34 is full of very good gymnasts			1
even the substitutes ' bench is full of very professional gymnasts , and competition is high , " she says			0
" even those gymnasts who do not represent the country at competitions are still very high - level professionals and if i would have to compete with them , it would be tough			2
" @entity1 's first mentor was @entity130 , and now they work under the supervision of national coach @entity132 -- the wife of @entity34 's richest man @entity134 , and the trainer of multiple @entity82 champions			1
" we are on good terms with @entity139			0
we sometimes have conflicts with a coach , as all gymnasts do , but in general we have a good relationship , " @entity1 says			1
together they choose the music and work on the choreography at the elite @entity148 training center based outside @entity1 's home city @entity150			1
" there are different levels of difficulty of elements , " she explains			0
" if co-ordination is good , it is easier to learn difficult elements			0
in my case it usually takes one or two weeks to learn new difficult elements			0
" despite having achieved so much at a young age , she says her coaches have kept her humble			0
" i can not say i have accomplished really a lot			0
like @entity164 says : " when you 're on the victory podium , you 're a queen , but when you come down from it , you 're nobody			0
' " you can not be too proud of yourself			0
i am just like my teammates , we 're all equal			0
" while some of @entity34 's elite athletes move into politics after their sporting days are over , such as tennis star @entity175 , @entity1 's goals are much more in keeping with those of the average teenage girl			1
" i would like to get a good education , get married and have kids , " she says			0
" i have n't thought about my future job yet			0
