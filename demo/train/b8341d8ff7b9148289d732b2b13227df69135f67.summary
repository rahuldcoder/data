@entity0 -- the mangled wrecks of cars being carried out of @entity5 's @entity4 suggest there was little motorists could do to escape the sudden collapse of the ceiling above them			1
a day after the disaster , one main theory has emerged as to what caused the collapse , which killed nine people who were trapped in their cars by rubble or the flames that broke out shortly after			1
at a press briefing on monday , the executive officer of the tunnel 's operator said it appeared that some " anchor bolts " used to secure concrete slabs to the tunnel ceiling were missing			1
" there were parts of concrete ( slabs ) where bolts had fallen off , " @entity27 said , according to a spokesman for @entity29 or @entity30			1
" the aging of the bolts or the concrete slabs could be a potential cause ( of the collapse ) , " @entity27 said			1
he did not say how many bolts were found to be missing or how they came to be loose			2
@entity27 added that while regular checks had been performed on the tunnel , they were visual checks and there was no physical testing			0
read more : nine bodies recovered from tunnel emergency inspections have been ordered on 49 tunnels across the country with the same ceiling structure , according to the @entity53			1
there are 1,575 highways tunnels in @entity5 and around a quarter of those are more than 30 years old , including the @entity4 which opened in 1977 , the ministry said			1
the tunnel 's ceiling gave way on sunday morning at around 8 a.m. local time			1
witnesses recalled the horror of smoke filling up the tunnel as huge concrete slabs rained down on traffic below			1
@entity5 highway police said monday the section of concrete that fell was 110 meters ( 360 feet ) long			1
charred bodies were pulled from the debris , including five from a single station wagon			0
three others were in a burned vehicle , according to a police spokesperson , while another body was found in a truck			0
i do n't think i could ever drive through the tunnel again , " one shaken survivor told @entity82 , as black and white video released by @entity30 showed rescue workers in flashlight - topped helmets stepping over rubble			2
the tunnel has been closed for the removal of debris and while experts ascertain the risk of a secondary accident			0
@entity30 says it 's unsure how long the process could take			0
speaking to reporters at the scene , @entity97 , the chief of @entity30 's @entity98 , also referred to a potential problem with the bolts securing the tunnel 's ceiling slabs			1
" at this moment we 're presuming that the top anchor bolts have come loose , " he was reported as saying			1
@entity105 added that the bolts had n't been changed since the tunnel first opened in the late 1970s			2
however , a company spokesman told @entity1 that @entity105 's comments should not be interpreted as the company 's official statement and that it could not confirm whether that was the case			0
one expert told @entity82 said that it 's possible that years of traffic vibrations had contributed to the tunnel 's collapse			1
" over the course of 35 years , all the shaking caused by cars has probably caused the bolts and nuts in the tunnel to loosen			2
as a result they fell off , " said @entity124 , head of the @entity125 at @entity126			0
immediately after the disaster , a company spokesman said the @entity4 , located about 80 kilometers ( 50 miles ) west of @entity132 , was subject to annual inspections with more detailed checks every five years			2
it had been checked in the last couple of months			0
at the company 's monday briefing , a @entity30 spokesman said , " there was no record that we have conducted the tapping inspection at top of the ceiling in the tunnel			2
" he was referring to a method used to identify potential damage within concrete structures that was mentioned in the company 's 2011 annual report			0
it says , " although hammer tapping test is commonly carried out to investigate concrete structures , it takes enormous time and cost to conduct the test on all concrete structures we have			0
" instead , it says the company inspects concrete structures using infrared cameras , an inspection technology which measures the difference in temperature between " sound conditions and damaged areas " to detect potential weak points			0
there as no explicit reference to testing carried out on tunnels			0
the @entity4 runs for 4.7 kilometers along a stretch of the @entity175 which runs for 367 kilometers , through a mountainous region , connecting @entity132 with the @entity177 in the @entity176 of @entity5			1
its operator , @entity30 is one of three companies started in 1995 after the privatization of @entity5 's @entity182			2
@entity30 manages more than 1,700 kilometers of expressways in @entity132 and the @entity176 , @entity185 and @entity186 regions , used by almost 1.9 million cars on any given day			0
journalist @entity188 , @entity1 's @entity189 and @entity190 contributed to this report .			0

collapse of @entity4 is being blamed on *failure* of " anchor bolts "
the bolts secure concrete slabs to the ceiling of the tunnel
nine people died when concrete slabs fell on traffic on sunday morning
forty - nine other tunnels of *similar* construction are being inspected across @entity5
