@entity0 , @entity1 -- five people arrested in @entity1 had been reported missing in the @entity5 , and police are confident they were planning terrorist acts , a @entity1 police official told @entity2			1
it is too soon to link the men with any terrorist organizations , said @entity11 , deputy superintendent of police in @entity12 , @entity1 , but preliminary investigations suggest they had sought to link up with the @entity14 and @entity16 militant organizations			0
neither group showed interest , however , @entity11 said			0
the five were from @entity20 and their families had contacted the @entity22 soon after they went missing , he said			1
they include two @entity1 - @entity5 , two @entity23 - @entity5 and an @entity24			1
the arrests came after a raid on a home in @entity12 , about 120 miles south of @entity0 , @entity11 said			0
no @entity5 officials have confirmed @entity11 's information , and there was no evidence charges had been filed			1
the @entity22 had said earlier that it was trying to determine whether a link existed between the five missing men and the arrests in @entity1			1
a @entity5 law enforcement official not authorized to speak for attribution said the five missing men were all @entity5 citizens			1
asked if they are the same men arrested in @entity1 , the official said , " we think it is , but we do n't have it firm ... the truthful answer is , we do n't know			0
" the @entity45 said it does not have confirmation of the arrested individuals ' identities or whether they are @entity5			1
the @entity5 embassy in @entity0 is seeking further information			1
if the individuals are @entity5 , the @entity5 will be seeking consular access , @entity45 spokesman @entity51 said			1
" if they are @entity5 citizens , we are going to be very interested in the charges they have been detained on and the circumstances in which they are being held , " he said			1
" that is something we would do anywhere and that is why the embassy is seeking further information			0
" under the @entity64 , @entity1 is required to notify the @entity5 about any @entity5 arrested , @entity51 said			1
the @entity5 law enforcement official said none of the five missing men had shown up on law enforcement 's radar before they were reported missing			1
" these guys never surfaced with us before			0
" authorities believe their intent was to wage jihad overseas rather than with terrorist acts in the @entity5 , the official said , but " there is still a lot of uncertainty about what they were up to			1
" a @entity1 official said the men arrived in @entity81 on november 30 and went on to @entity82 and then @entity12 , where they were arrested wednesday , the official said			0
the arrests came at the behest of local police			0
preliminary investigations are ongoing , the official said			2
the @entity88 said in a statement wednesday it was assisting in the investigation of " five @entity92 young men from @entity20 who left the country recently under mysterious circumstances			1
" the parents of the missing youths and local @entity92 leaders approached the council about the disappearances and the organization " immediately informed the @entity22 , " the council said			1
council spokesman @entity102 said one of the missing youths was a student at @entity105 , and all five knew each other			1
one of the youths left a video behind , @entity109 , the council 's executive director , told reporters			1
" i was disturbed by the content of it , " he said			0
one person appeared in it , and made references to " the ongoing conflict in the world , and that young @entity92 have to do something , " @entity109 said			1
he said the video " juxtaposed certain verses of the @entity121 , " and he suggested there was a misunderstanding of those verses and their potential misuse			2
the video is about 11 minutes long , he said , and is " like a farewell			2
" @entity109 said it did not specify what the youths would be doing , but he has seen similar videos on the @entity133 , and " it just made me uncomfortable			0
" one source identified the missing @entity105 student as @entity137 , who was studying dentistry at the @entity140 college			1
no further details were immediately available , and it was not immediately known whether he was among those arrested in @entity1			0
the council and the @entity145 realize there is a problem , although it is not widespread , @entity109 said , and is " going to launch a major campaign of education to refute the misuse of verses in the @entity121 , or the misuse of certain grievances in the @entity92 world			2
we believe that we can do a lot to reinstate confidence in young @entity158 , that they have to be fully engaged , as the majority of them are engaged in civic life and in the political process			0
" he and other @entity92 officials cautioned against a rush to judgment against the youths , and praised their families and members of the @entity92 community for approaching law enforcement and assisting in the investigation			2
at the end of november , he said , the youths told their parents they were attending a local conference , but their parents became suspicious when calling their cell phones because they got what sounded like an overseas ring tone			0
the families then went to the council			2
" the main concern was to get them back and figure out what was going on and protect any national security and everybody 's rights , " @entity102 said			0
he said he understood the five left the country in a couple of groups at the end of november			2
along with the families and @entity92 community leaders , the council said it was working to assist investigators			0
@entity197 of the @entity198 in the @entity140 area , said that while the five were active in their mosques , " from all of our interviews , there 's been no sign that they were in any way outwardly radicalized ... there have n't been any reports that there was anything outwardly suspicious in their behavior			0
" the @entity22 is aware of the arrests , and is also investigating a report of five people reported missing from the @entity140 area , said @entity216 , spokeswoman for the agency 's @entity140 field office			1
" we are working with @entity1 authorities to determine their identities and the nature of their business there " -- if the people arrested are the people who are missing , she said			0
she declined to elaborate , citing an ongoing investigation			0
@entity5 authorities have been wary of @entity229 militants recruiting young @entity92 from the @entity5 to fight overseas			2
prosecutors in @entity231 recently arrested eight @entity233 - @entity5 men on charges related to what they said were efforts to recruit youths from the @entity239 area to fight for @entity240 , a @entity233 guerrilla movement battling the @entity244 country 's @entity242 - backed transitional government			2
at least two young men from @entity231 have been killed in @entity233 , including one who blew himself up in what is believed to have been the first suicide bombing carried out by a naturalized @entity5 citizen			2
the matter has " always been a concern , " secretary of state @entity250 said wednesday			0
" we have been well aware of the threats that we continue to face along with friends and allies around the world ... we know that we have to work more closely with both @entity258 and @entity1 to try to root out the infrastructure of terrorism that continues to recruit and train people			0
" @entity2 's @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
