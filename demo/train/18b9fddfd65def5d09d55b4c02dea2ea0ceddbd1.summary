@entity0 -- @entity3 officials slammed the decision of the @entity5 newspaper saturday to print pictures of prince @entity8 's wife @entity7 sunbathing topless on vacation as driven only by greed			1
the @entity5 's move comes a day after the royal couple launched legal action against the @entity15 magazine closer over the images , and as @entity18 magazine @entity17 says it will publish the photos on monday			1
" there can be no motivation for this action other than greed , " a @entity3 spokeswoman said of the @entity23 tabloid 's decision			1
but editor @entity28 told the @entity29 that outrage over the images was only felt in @entity32 and that readers in the @entity23 wanted to know what all the " kerfuffle " was about			1
he was " a little taken aback by the reaction in the @entity32 , " he said , saying the newspaper was treating @entity7 no differently to any other celebrity			1
" she 's not the future queen of @entity43 so really the only place this is causing fury seems to be in the @entity32 , " he said , suggesting that the @entity32 press were behaving with some hypocrisy			2
@entity28 said the @entity5 was reproducing the images as published in @entity48 on friday rather than buying them itself directly			1
the pictures are not being published in the @entity43 edition			0
@entity54 welcome awaits @entity8 and @entity55 the publication of the photos in the @entity15 closer magazine , owned by the same parent company as @entity17 , the @entity60 , sparked an angry response from the royal couple and palace officials			1
@entity8 and @entity7 were said to be " hugely saddened " by what palace officials called a " grotesque " invasion of privacy while they were on a private vacation			1
the latest controversy comes only three weeks after the @entity32 royal family was caught up in a media furor over images of @entity8 's younger brother , prince @entity73 , partying naked in his @entity75 hotel room with a group of girls			1
in a sign of how divisive the issue of royal privacy has become , a co-owner of the @entity5 , media group @entity78 , said it in no way backed the newspaper 's decision to run the pictures of @entity7			1
in a statement , the company -- which runs the @entity5 in a joint venture with @entity90 , but does not exert editorial control over it -- said it was " profoundly dismayed " by the move			1
" we abhor the decision of the @entity5 to publish these intrusive pictures of the @entity97 and @entity55 , which we , like @entity3 , believe to be a grotesque invasion of their privacy , " @entity78 's communications director @entity94 said			1
@entity78 also owns the @entity101 and the @entity5 , among other @entity32 publications , which have not run the pictures of @entity7 , nor of @entity73			1
@entity8 , who is second in line to the throne , and his wife are on an official tour of southeast @entity108 nations			0
they were in @entity110 saturday , where they escaped from the outside world on a rainforest trek			0
they will travel on to the @entity116 sunday on the next leg of a tour that has been overshadowed by the furor over the photographs			0
@entity7 was " upset " with closer magazine , a palace source told @entity1			1
@entity123 told @entity1 it plans to run 26 pages of photographs of @entity8 and @entity55 on vacation in an " extraordinary " special edition to go on sale in @entity18 on monday			1
@entity17 's front cover will also feature three revealing pictures of @entity7 , according to a copy of the page and statement sent by @entity123 spokeswoman @entity134 via e-mail			1
" it is a story worth publishing in an extraordinary edition because it shows in a natural light the everyday life of a very famous contemporary young couple in love , " @entity17 's editor - in - chief , @entity136 , is quoted as saying in the statement			1
" the fact that they happen to be the future king and queen of @entity148 certainly makes it more interesting and current , and in line with today 's concept of monarchy			2
" a @entity3 spokeswoman said : " we will not be commenting on potential legal action concerning the alleged intended publication of the photos in @entity18 save to say that all proportionate responses will be kept under review			1
" any such publication would serve no purpose other than to cause further , entirely unjustifiable upset to the @entity97 and @entity55 , who were enjoying time alone together in the privacy of a relative 's home			2
" the palace confirmed friday that legal proceedings for breach of privacy had been launched in @entity15 by the couple against the publishers of @entity48 in @entity15			2
opinion : @entity32 privacy should start with @entity32 press according to @entity123 's website , @entity48 has an average weekly circulation of about 414,000 , while @entity17 sells more than 340,000 copies a week			2
@entity179 , daughter of former @entity18 prime minister @entity180 , has been chairwoman of the media group since 2003			2
legal analysts suggest the company hopes to recoup any legal costs and fines it may incur by increasing sales , thanks to the revealing pictures			0
the grainy pictures published by @entity48 in @entity15 appear to have been taken with a long camera lens while the couple was staying at a private chateau belonging to @entity8 's uncle in @entity194 , in southern @entity15			0
the new privacy controversies have dredged up the royal family 's often rocky relationship with the press and put a spotlight on how the palace deals with the media after the tragic death of @entity8 's mother , @entity203 , as she fled photographers in @entity205 15 years ago			2
@entity8 and @entity7 were " hugely saddened to learn that a @entity15 publication and a photographer have invaded their privacy in such a grotesque and totally unjustifiable manner , " a @entity3 spokesman said friday			1
" the incident is reminiscent of the worst excesses of the press and paparazzi during the life of @entity203 , and all the more upsetting to the @entity97 and @entity55 for being so , " the palace spokesman said			0
" @entity218 had every expectation of privacy in the remote house			0
it is unthinkable that anyone should take such photographs , let alone publish them			0
" @entity225 , editor - in - chief of @entity48 in @entity15 , defended the decision to publish the images in an interview with @entity1 affiliate @entity229 , saying : " we were just doing our job			1
" @entity225 said that there had been no debate at the magazine over whether to publish the photos , and that they show the royals " are just like any other couple in love			0
" the website of @entity48 on friday showed the front cover of the magazine with blurry images of @entity8 and @entity55 , along with the headline " @entity244 ! " but did not link to the four - page spread			1
@entity32 tabloid prints naked prince @entity73 pictures but by saturday that was replaced by a statement from the management of @entity48 , which said the photos it chose to publish " are in no case degrading			0
" " they show a young couple on vacation , beautiful , in love and modern , in their normal life			0
the article recounts the time the couple recently spent in southern @entity15 , " it said			0
it also made clear the magazine is not linked with the @entity32 publication of the same name			0
@entity8 and his wife were in @entity267 when the news broke , part way through a nine - day @entity108 tour of @entity272 nations , which started in @entity273 and will conclude with a stop in @entity275			0
the @entity277 tour forms part of diamond jubilee celebrations for the queen , @entity8 's grandmother			0
@entity32 lawyer @entity281 said friday that @entity48 's decision to publish was a clear breach of @entity15 legal codes and was out of line with current views on people 's right to privacy			0
" the perception of the @entity15 was that they are less aggressive , that they have a culturally different opinion of where privacy laws should lie			0
here they appear to have gone right over the other way , " she said			0
@entity15 law provides for " draconian sanctions " to protect against this kind of behavior , she said , including orders to take magazines off shelves and the imposition of serious fines			0
but even if distribution of the images is contained to a degree , @entity307 said , the damage is done to the extent that very private information about the duchess has now become public knowledge			0
no @entity32 newspaper has so far published the photographs of @entity7			2
in the case of @entity73 , the photographs were widely circulated online but were published in only one @entity32 tabloid , @entity320 , after palace officials asked @entity32 media not to run them			2
the @entity320 has made clear that it wo n't publish the pictures of @entity7 , however			2
editor @entity324 tweeted : " @entity320 has no intention of breaching the royal couple 's privacy			2
the circumstances are very different to those relating to the photos of @entity73 in @entity75			0
" the @entity331 , the @entity32 press watchdog , received about 3,800 complaints from the public over the prince harry photos but said it was inappropriate for it to take any action in the absence of a formal complaint from the palace			1
royal officials appear to be taking publication of the photographs of @entity8 and @entity7 much more seriously			1
the @entity32 media is currently under close scrutiny after revelations of phone hacking and other abuses			0
the conclusions of an independent judge - led inquiry , which may recommend greater restrictions on media freedoms , are expected by the end of the year			0
after @entity203 : how can intimate royal photos be published in @entity15 ? @entity1 's @entity355 contributed to this report .			2

new : owners of the @entity5 " profoundly dismayed " by its publication of images
palace : " there can be no motivation for this action other than greed "
editor of the @entity5 says @entity7 is no different to any other celebrity
@entity18 's @entity373 will run a 26 - page special with the topless photos , publisher says
