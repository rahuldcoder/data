" the cases of human rights abuses we documented in @entity3 are likely to be only a small proportion of what really happened during @entity4 's rule , " @entity46 said			1

you could n't see anything			0
" he was later released without charge			0
@entity119 , a catholic lay activist , was arrested in december 1982			0

at some point i felt it was too much for me and i could n't stand any more			0
i said to them , ' you guys , instead of torturing me like that , it would be better if you just killed me and get it over with ... ' " he was released without charge and needed treatment in a hospital , including skin grafts			0

you can not move on without that closure			0
" with the release of its report , @entity8 urged @entity3 's new president , @entity177 , to take swift action			1
" @entity3 's current government led by president @entity177 has an obligation under international law to bring to justice those responsible for the crimes against humanity committed during @entity4 's years , " @entity46 said			1
