-- for 585 days , @entity2 adventurer @entity1 braved storms , pirates and cloudy skies in an attempt to circumnavigate the globe on a boat propelled by nothing but sun beams			1
the boat , christened " @entity18 " after a word meaning " power of the sun " in @entity16 's " @entity15 " trilogy , is @entity1 's brainchild			1
as heavy as a whale and 30 meters long , it 's adorned with enough photovoltaic panels to cover two tennis courts			2
after eight years of fundraising , 64,000 hours of construction , and 19 months at sea , the " @entity32 " made history on may 6 , when it cruised into @entity28 , @entity29 , completing the first ever round - the - world journey by a solar - powered vessel			1
from the coast of @entity34 to the shores of @entity36 , @entity1 and his four - man crew visited 28 countries on a voyage designed to showcase the practical applications of solar energy			1
" the aim of this journey was to show the world that this technology is not science fiction , it is very real and it can help us change how we do things now rather than in the future , " said @entity1			2
" everywhere we went people would flock around the boat			2
they had never seen such a strange design before , " he added			0
but for the 40 - year - old skipper , whose youth was spent wading through pages of adventure books , the voyage was also a fruition of boyhood aspirations			1
" i remember sitting on my grandfather 's knee listening to him reading ' @entity63 ' by @entity64			2
it made me want to go out and explore just like @entity66 , " recalled @entity1			0

he then trained to become a mountain guide and a rescue specialist in hazardous environments			0
this preparation would prove invaluable during the more perilous parts of his journey			0
on numerous occasions the boat had to endure winds of up to 100 kilometers an hour as it was rocked by storms off the @entity84 and @entity85 coasts			0
" we faced some really rough weather , but the boat always operated well during those times , even better than we expected , " he said			0
in fact , @entity1 says that the most serious threat came not from @entity93 , but from fellow man			0
while crossing the @entity95 -- a waterway in the @entity96 notorious for kidnapping and hijacking -- @entity1 faced little choice but to recruit six @entity101 soldiers for protection			0
" normally ships speed up to 15 or 20 knots when crossing this area but we could n't go faster than five knots , " said @entity1			1
indeed , one of " @entity32 's " comparative limitations is its snail - like pace			1
it has a maximum speed less than that of a large oil - tanker , just 7.5 knots ( 14 kilometers an hour )			1
fortunately for @entity1 and his crew , no pirates attempted to confront the muscle - bound @entity101 commandos or the unusual looking boat			1
it would have certainly made a rare and impressive bounty			0
the $ 16 million vessel not only boasts 536 square - meters of shiny photovoltaic panels , but also the world 's largest rechargeable lithium battery -- capable of storing enough power to allow the " @entity32 " to travel for five full days without sunlight			1
" most people think that if the sun does n't shine the boat would n't work , but it is impossible to sail for one year and only have good weather			2
the beauty is that you never get nothing from the sun , she is always giving us energy			0
not once did we run out of power , " boasted @entity1			0
the ship 's captain has reason to be proud			0
having completed the 50,000 kilometer journey , the " @entity18 " returns with five @entity147 to its name : longest solar journey ; first solar circumnavigation ; fastest solar crossing of the @entity152 ; fastest solar crossing of the @entity155 and - no surprises here -- a record for the world 's largest solar - powered boat			1
read more from @entity159 : the boat that @entity162 's guitar built @entity1 concedes that that the " @entity32 " and its crew have little competition in these categories , but hopes this wo n't be the case for long			1
" i really hope our journey will make people realize the sheer power of solar energy and that it can be used efficiently for long - haul travel , " he said			2
now back in @entity174 , @entity1 is taking some time off to recharge his own batteries , before getting back to work , thinking of new ways to spread the solar power message to the world .			2

the " @entity18 " is the first solar powered boat to sail around the world
the circumnavigation took 585 days to complete
the boat 's top speed is 7.5 knots - about that of an oil tanker
the " @entity32 " set five @entity147 during its voyage
