-- how many years would you like to live ? seriously : if you had a choice , what would the number be ? by the side of an expressway the other afternoon , i saw a billboard paid for by @entity9 , the big insurance and financial - services company			1
the message , in letters large enough that no motorist zipping by could miss them : " the first person to live to 150 is @entity11			1
" for centuries , scientists have been debating theories about just how long , with proper health care and judicious personal habits , the human lifespan can extend			2
in recent years , the 150 number has been up for discussion			1
some have scoffed at that prospect , but insurance - company actuaries and retirement - planning accountants are not known for wacky practical jokes -- they are as somber - eyed as funeral directors as they calculate just how big a risk they run while writing policies for their customers of various ages -- so the sight of that @entity9 billboard was a little jarring			1
i contacted @entity9 's corporate headquarters , and the company forwarded to me a table of federal statistics showing the lengthening average lifespans in the @entity42 over the past 80 or so years			1
in 1930 , the average life expectancy ( measured at birth ) of @entity42 was 59.7 years			1
by 1940 , it had grown to 62.9			2
1980 : 73.7 1990 : 75.4			2
whether infants born today are entering a world in which 150th birthdays will eventually become if not common then at least possible , the thought raises separate issues for insurance and financial - planning firms than it does for the rest of us			1
for those companies , the prospect provides marketing opportunities			2
but for everyone else , it prompts the vexing question : would you really want to live that long ? medical advances and emphasis on nutrition and keeping fit notwithstanding , can you imagine what it would be like to reach the age of 75 and think that you might only be halfway home ? to put it in perspective : a person who was 150 today would have been born while the @entity73 was still being fought			1
longer is better ; that 's what we have always been taught to assume about a lifespan			1
and changes in the way we live have , in fact , transformed our expectations for what the metrics of a full life are			1
an emphasis on the benefits of healthy eating and regular exercise has altered the texture of @entity42 life			0
in the 1950s , had a man been seen sprinting down the street in a residential neighborhood in the middle of the day , some people 's instinct would have been to immediately holler , " stop , thief ! " today , the streets would seem barren without the sight of runners and joggers doing their daily best to keep in shape			1
smoking cigarettes has evolved from a national habit into something regarded as almost illicit			0
i thought of the late @entity109 , who built @entity110 's into an international business behemoth by relentlessly marketing burgers and fries , the other morning when i walked by one of the company 's restaurants and saw that the one and only item being promoted on its marquee was " @entity119			0
" for the past 10 years , @entity120 have been aggressively pushing salads			1
and woe be to any restaurateur who is not fully cognizant of the importance of a pair of words that , just a decade or two ago , would have sounded vaguely alien : " gluten - free			0
" but as we head toward a time when 150 - year - olds may be walking among us , it 's not illogical to consider whether that would really be such a wonderful thing			1
to some people , the very thought of it is undoubtedly more than a little exhausting			0
if such a possibility does come to pass , what will happen to the retirement age ? will @entity42 be expected to work until they 're 110 ? ( and if you think @entity141 and the finances of long - term medical care are controversial subjects now ... ) expectations about the passage of time are changing , and we take note of it as we observe the career trajectories of public figures			2
when @entity155 turned 30 in 1973 , some people theorized that the @entity156 ' days of touring might be numbered			0
could a rock band , no matter how skilled , still find an audience when its members were in their 30s ? but the @entity156 are on tour this summer , and next month @entity155 will turn 70			0
the band 's drummer , @entity164 , is 72 , the same age as @entity167			0
yet it 's unlikely that the world has seen the last @entity156 show			0
but it 's one thing for @entity155 to be singing in packed stadiums at 70 ; it would be quite another if someone were to tap him on the shoulder and tell him that he still had more than half of his life ahead of him			0
when @entity180 was in his 70s , i visited with him backstage before what would turn out to be his last @entity184 concert performance			0
that night , he went out onto the stage , and at one point he lifted a glass and offered a toast to his audience : " i hope you live to be 675 years old , and the last voice you hear is mine			1
" no one is talking about being 675 yet , but @entity9 is raising the possibility of 150 , and it will be instructive to see whether people embrace the notion of being around that long or if the proposition of that protracted a slog gives them the chills			2
this is the first weekend of calendar summer , a good time to reflect upon such matters			2
summers are fleeting and precious ; we have always known that			0
they 're over almost before they have begun			0
you are only given so many			0
but , even acknowledging that , it would seem supremely odd for some future 25 - year - old to routinely think , on the first day of summer : i 'd better savor these warm days and nights			0
after this year , i may only have 125 summers left			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217 .			1

@entity217 saw a billboard saying " the first person to live to 150 is @entity11 "
@entity217 : we live longer than ever *due* to medical advances , good nutrition , keeping fit
@entity217 : still , a person who was 150 today would have been born during @entity73
he asks : but who wants to be 75 and be aware that you *'ve* got another 75 years to go ?
