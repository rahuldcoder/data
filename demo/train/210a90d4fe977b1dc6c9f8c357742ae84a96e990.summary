-- president @entity1 has characterized his 2014 budget , released wednesday , not as his ideal vision for how much the federal government ought to tax and spend , but rather as a compromise that aims to respect the priorities of @entity7 and @entity8			1
he has insisted that congressional @entity8 see the policy options laid out in his budget as a package deal , not as a menu of policy options from which to choose			0
and so the president 's budget includes reductions in the planned growth of @entity18 and @entity20 spending , to appeal to conservative advocates of spending restraint , and a number of tax increases , the bulk of which are designed to affect high - earners , a high priority of the president 's congressional allies			1
house speaker @entity31 and other leading congressional @entity8 have made their opposition to further tax increases clear			1
but president @entity1 's tax proposals nevertheless merit close attention , as they tell us a great deal about his priorities			1
one of the ways the @entity1 administration seeks to raise revenue is to have the federal government adopt chained @entity43 , a method of calculating consumer price inflation that factors in the fact that consumers tend to substitute some goods for others in response to rising or falling prices			2
chained @entity43 has been discussed primarily with regards to its impact on federal outlays , and particularly @entity18 spending , as it is expected to lead to somewhat lower cost - of - living adjustments that in turn will lead to somewhat lower @entity18 benefit levels			0
yet chained @entity43 will also lead tax brackets to be adjusted more slowly than they are under the federal government 's current inflation index			0
this adjustment is expected to yield roughly $ 100 billion in new tax revenues over the next decade			2
in addition , the president has revived two proposals that figured prominently in his 2013 budget : the so - called " @entity69 , " which requires that households earning $ 1 million or more pay a minimum of 30 % of their income in federal taxes , after allowing for charitable giving , and a limit on tax deductions for the highest - earning 2 % of households			1
the @entity69 essentially raises taxes on millionaires who earn long - term capital gains , as @entity81 of the conservative @entity82 has explained			0
the downside of the @entity69 , according to @entity81 , is that it might discourage capital investment and increase reliance on debt financing			0
the limit on tax deductions , meanwhile , reduces the value of itemized deductions to the 28 % tax rate for households			0
that is , even as a household enters the 33 , 35 , and 39.6 % tax brackets , the value of its itemized deductions will remain at the lower 28 % rate			0
the president 's budget also calls for substantial increases in federal taxes on tobacco products , which are designed to fund new preschool efforts			2
president @entity1 's tax proposals illustrate how difficult it will be to raise tax revenues by a substantial amount while shielding middle - income households from tax increases			1
chained @entity43 and tax increases on tobacco products will almost certainly affect some number of households earning less than $ 250,000 a year , yet the @entity1 administration also intends to increase the size of the @entity116 and the @entity117 , which will tend to mitigate any harmful effect			1
capping the value of itemized deductions will raise a substantial amount of revenue			0
but it wo n't do as much as more ambitious proposals to limit individual tax expenditures , like converting tax preferences tied to marginal tax rates to nonrefundable tax credits			0
this approach , however , also runs into political pitfalls , as it will raise taxes on at least some middle - income households , even as it reduces them for large numbers of low - and middle - income non-itemizers			1
if president @entity1 hopes to build momentum for a substantial revenue increase , he would be well advised to cheer on the efforts of sen. @entity139 , @entity140 , and rep. @entity141 , @entity142 , the chairmen of the tax - writing committees of the @entity145 and @entity146 respectively , as both are working toward a larger , more ambitious tax overhaul			1
though @entity141 and his @entity8 allies are resistant to tax increases , they might prove more amenable if comprehensive tax reform results in lower rates			1
back in 2011 , for example , the center - left @entity153 released its " @entity156 , " which eliminated all tax expenditures but the @entity116 and the @entity117 and lowered rates to 12 , 22 , and 28 %			2
despite these substantially lower rates , revenues would increase , in part because capital income would be subject to the same tax rates as ordinary income			2
of course , measures like the @entity69 would increase effective taxes on capital income even further			0
if @entity139 and @entity167 converge around something like the @entity156 , the tax debate might finally break out of its current grim stalemate			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			2

@entity172 : president is casting his budget as one with *bipartisan* appeal
he says @entity1 still wants to target high income earners for tax increases
parts of the @entity1 plan will affect middle - income *taxpayers* , too , he says
@entity172 : budget shows difficulty of raising revenues without hitting middle class
