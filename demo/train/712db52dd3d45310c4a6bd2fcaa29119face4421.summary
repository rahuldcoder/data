-- remember when supermodel @entity1 said she did n't " wake up for less than $ 10,000 a day ? " the provocative comment -- made in @entity3 in 1990 -- haunted the @entity5 beauty for the rest of her career			1
but fast forward two decades and $ 10,000 now seems like a paltry figure in comparison with today 's " modelpreneurs			2
" how about rousing yourself from bed to the tune of $ 42 million a year ? that 's how much @entity18 @entity17 earned in 12 months , according to @entity20 's latest list of the world 's richest models			1
if it seems impossible to earn that much money from sashaying down a catwalk alone , then that 's because it is			1
@entity17 does n't make her millions simply from modeling -- she makes them through lucrative endorsement deals with everyone from @entity32 to @entity33 , and her own line of sandals with footwear company @entity36			1
a new generation enter a new era of supermodel - turned - supermogul , where girls as young as 16 start carving brand names for themselves from the moment they hit the fashion runway			0
" if you look at the top models , they probably make 10 % to 15 % of their money from the catwalk -- the rest is really made from endorsements and brands , " said @entity48 , chief executive of @entity49 , which represents corporations that partner with celebrities			1
" it used to be retired models who created their own brands			0
now a lot of newer girls are thinking about it from the very start -- you do n't need to be in the business for 10 years to build a name for yourself anymore			1
" @entity48 pointed to the rise of social media in helping young models build a global following			2
by using @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity81 they can reach out to the public with more ease than ever before -- and push their brand			0
the @entity17 factor but being attractive , young , and tech - savvy is n't always enough to catapult you to the top of the model rich list			1
there 's also another factor : personality			0
" the ability to sell has nothing to do with your profession -- it 's down to your popularity and likeability , " said @entity48			0
he pointed to the phenomenal success of @entity17 , who this year tops the rich list for the seventh time			1
" she 's a global phenomenon who 's been able to transcend the industry , " he said			0
" now she 's a mom , that 's also opened her up to more categories of commercialism			0
" " and the fact that she 's married to @entity111 footballer @entity110 means she also gets added coverage			0
" @entity115 's @entity114 celebrities trailing behind @entity17 on the @entity20 list is @entity118 @entity117 on $ 7.2 million a year -- also a former @entity120 model -- who today has deals with @entity123 , @entity124 , and her own beauty products line , @entity126			1
in fact , eight of the top ten models in the @entity20 list have worked for the @entity120 lingerie label , a major name in the fashion industry which provides international exposure for its " angels , " as they 're called			1
and as the price of hiring well - known actresses continues to rise , retailers are increasingly turning to models to sell their products			2
" celebrities are becoming a lot less affordable , " said @entity48			0
" models are now in a very strong period commercially , more so than ever before			0
" " the more you are believable to the brand you 're representing the better -- a lot of it has to do with trust			0
a model is seen as someone who understands good design , fashion and accessories			0
" it pays to be pretty ( savvy ) in an industry where you can be seen as " over the hill " in your 30s , it pays to build a career off the catwalk			2
" it helps your longevity			2
it means when your looks start to fade you 'll still have a lucrative career , " said @entity48			1
for @entity17 and her fellow multimillion dollar " modelpreneurs , " it seems they really are more than just pretty faces .			2
