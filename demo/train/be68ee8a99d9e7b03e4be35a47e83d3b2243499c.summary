@entity2 officials will appeal to the @entity4 @entity3 a lower - court ruling allowing same - sex marriage in the state , the state attorney general 's office said thursday			1
newly appointed @entity2 attorney general @entity8 will seek a stay of the federal judge 's ruling after state officials consult first with outside attorneys over the next few days			1
" it is the intent of the attorney general 's office to file with the @entity3 as soon as possible , " the attorney general 's office said in a statement			0
the emergency appeal , when filed , would go to justice @entity20 because she has jurisdiction over appeals from @entity2 and nearby states			0
she could rule on the state 's application herself or ask the entire nine - member court to weigh in			0
@entity20 is likely to refer the @entity2 request to the entire court , as is tradition with high - profile traditional cases , said @entity32 , a professor of constitutional law at the @entity34			1
the @entity2 announcement comes two days after state officials lost their case in a federal appeals court , which said the state 's request for a stay was n't warranted and ordered the appeal process be expedited			2
the appeals court 's ruling allows same - sex marriages to continue in @entity2 while appeals continue			2
last week , @entity4 district judge @entity47 struck down @entity2 's ban on same - sex marriage , saying the law " conflicts with the @entity52 's guarantees of equal protection and due process under the law			1
" @entity2 voters approved a law banning same - sex marriage in 2004			2
judge @entity47 's ruling drew national attention partly because @entity2 is viewed as among the more conservative states and because the @entity4 @entity3 just ruled this summer on same - sex marriage			1
in june , the nation 's highest court cleared the way for same - sex marriages in @entity66 to resume after it ruled private parties did not have " standing " to defend @entity66 's voter - approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state - sanctioned wedlock			1
the @entity4 @entity3 also rejected parts of the @entity73 ( @entity73 ) in a 5 - 4 decision , dismissing an appeal over same - sex marriage on jurisdictional grounds and ruling same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits			1
in the @entity2 case , the state argues that the " federal district court 's ruling that same - sex marriage is a fundamental right has never been established in any previous case in the @entity86 , the attorney general 's office said			1
the federal judge 's ruling , nonetheless , prompted a rush of same - sex couples to courthouses in @entity2 where they obtained marriage licenses , despite the state 's ongoing legal challenge			2
some jurisdictions such as @entity98 and @entity99 are issuing marriage licenses to same - sex couples , but there have n't been requests for them there , officials said			0
@entity2 gov. @entity105 has criticized judge @entity47 's ruling of last week , calling him " an activist federal judge			0
" @entity47 said the state 's " current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and , in so doing , demean the dignity of these same - sex couples for no rational reason			0
" accordingly , the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional , " the judge said			0
same - sex marriage is banned by constitutional amendment or state law in : @entity151 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 , @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity120			0
