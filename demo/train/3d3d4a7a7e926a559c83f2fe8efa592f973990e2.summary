-- when @entity2 wakes up and sits down at his computer in the morning , he usually checks the @entity4 , the @entity5 , @entity6 and the polls on @entity8			2
but the day after the election , he realized he did n't need to check those polls			2
@entity2 will focus on writing and filmmaking now that he does n't have election polls to check			2
" there is some sadness to that , " said @entity2 , a @entity14 , @entity15 , resident who frequently contributes his views to @entity17			2
although he supported president - elect @entity23 since the primaries , the end of the presidential election means he wo n't have a race to follow anymore			1
" i expect serious withdrawal , like , tonight or tomorrow , " he said wednesday			1
after two intense years of campaign ups and downs for both major @entity31 political parties , the nation has finally settled on a president			2
although initially , @entity23 's victory brings celebrations for supporters , experts say the let - down that voters of each side may feel after the campaign is akin to postpartum depression			1
" there 's this run - up : ok , it 's nine months , and then the baby is delivered , " said @entity44 , a clinical psychologist in @entity45 , @entity46			1
" all of the waiting is over , and the focus of the attention is no longer on the pregnant woman , but there 's all kinds of feelings about the loss of the pregnancy			1
" maybe we will have some people who will have post-election depression because they have been expectantly looking forward to this blessed event that they participated in , " she said			1
@entity63 , a clinical psychologist @entity64 , @entity65 , started seeing some post-election despair even before the final results came in			2
some of her patients wondered what they would do with their time in the absence of polls and campaign coverage			0
" this lady is in her 80s , and she told me she 's never in her life been excited about a campaign as she is about this campaign , and she knows it 's filled this void in her life , " she said			1
supporters of the winning candidate may feel as if they are going through withdrawal from a drug , @entity63 said			1
they may also develop anxiety over what will change with the new president or become cynical about anything changing at all			0
by contrast , someone whose favored candidate lost may go through something similar to grieving : starting with numb disbelief and then moving to anger , sadness and , eventually , recognition of the need to move on , she said			0
mourning over a lost campaign resonates with @entity99 , a @entity0 contributor who worked on @entity103 's campaign in 2000			1
in a column for @entity0 , she recalled feeling lost and disillusioned at first , and had no idea what to do with her life			0
" it hurts like hell , " she wrote			0
" it is like death of someone close to you -- the difference is no corpse or casket to help bring closure , just more election analysis and pundits spewing out what you did wrong			0
" she advises staff members , volunteers and supporters of candidates who lost on tuesday to let out their grief : " @entity126			1
" read @entity99 's ' a letter to the losers ' to combat the letdown of the period after the election , @entity63 advises people to put routine back into their lives			1
political junkies who lost their sleeping and eating routines should get back on schedule , she said			0
they should also take part in community activities , such as book clubs or other interest groups			0
even supporters of winning and losing candidates may feel a little off for two weeks or more , she said			1
for some , the excitement will continue for a couple of weeks , until the reality sets in that the candidates they elected wo n't be able to do anything until january , said @entity153 , a licensed psychologist in @entity154 , @entity15			0
anyone who feels depressed , hopeless or powerless after the election should realize that they as individuals have the ultimate control over their everyday lives , she said			0
" the president is not going to find you a job ; the president is not the one who manages your individual budgets , " she said			0
" if people want changes , they can do that in their day - to - day lives			0
they do n't need a candidate to do that			0
" those who feel truly overwhelmed should see a psychologist who can help them think out loud , she said			1
@entity176 , a @entity177 student who supported sen. @entity178 , said he 's not upset that @entity23 won but does feel a sense of withdrawal			1
" i love discussing and debating politics , and now that the election is over it seems like nobody wants to discuss politics anymore , which is very disappointing ( in ) this short ( time ) after the election , " he said in a recent e-mail			0
but for some , the end of the election season brings feelings of relief			0
@entity192 , a student at @entity193 in @entity194 and a @entity178 supporter , said thursday that he feels better now than throughout the campaign because of the bitterness and anger that it sparked in some people			0
a few weeks ago , when he was at a rally , someone slashed the tires of his car , which had a @entity178 bumper sticker			0
" we had all kind of accepted that @entity23 was going to win probably , for the last month for so , so it was n't like we were really that hopeful going into the election , so we had come to grips with it , at least i had , " he said			1
" i 'm ready for everything to kind of go back to normal			2
" others say the end of the election simply means they 'll have more time to focus on other aspects of their life			0
@entity219 , a @entity220 student who supported @entity23 , said he 'll now have more time to concentrate on schoolwork and maintains that his " withdrawal " will not be of postpartum proportions			1
with more free time in the absence of campaign - following , @entity2 said he 's going to get focused on his own writing and filmmaking			2
@entity17 : ' @entity23 won -- now maybe we can move forward ' " as ( @entity23 ) said ( tuesday ) night , it 's time to get to work , and get things moving forward again , instead of all this fighting , all this resistance that we 've had , " he said .			1
