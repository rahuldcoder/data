@entity1 's heart had raced ever since she was 11			1
it would randomly speed up at times and then drop back to normal			0
but those quirks did n't stop her from lacing up her boots for a hike every weekend or jumping in the pool for a long swim -- at least until she gave birth to her little girl in august 2008			0
that 's when her heart changed			1
two weeks after delivering her daughter @entity15 , @entity14 realized something was very wrong			1
the 32 - year - old began experiencing numbness in her limbs and had severe chest pain			0
" my heart felt like a @entity26 ball -- it was going crazy speeding up and slowing down , " she remembers			1
@entity14 went to see a cardiologist in their new home state of @entity31			1
she did n't know what to expect ; for years doctors had shrugged off her symptoms			1
she was stunned to learn that her problems were caused by heart disease			1
the new mother had a left ventricular non-compaction cardiomyopathy , a congenital disorder that affects a small percentage of people			1
with @entity45 , muscle fibers in the lower left chamber of the heart do not turn into solid muscle as they should during normal development			2
instead the fibers remain and interfere with the heart 's function			2
@entity14 's cardiologist suspected that she also had @entity52 , an abnormal heart rhythm disorder that could potentially cause sudden cardiac arrest			1
the diagnosis sent her into a spiral of depression			0
" i thought i was going to die , " she says			0
she had already put on 40 pounds during pregnancy and was now being told she could n't do anything active that would strain her heart			1
life became a series of tests and checkups , shuffling in and out of the hospital			2
she had to get an implantable cardioverter defibrillator ( @entity67 ) implanted , and was put on heart medication to regulate her life - threatening arrhythmias			1
eventually , @entity14 started seeing a counselor to deal with the emotional pain			1
" that first year with my daughter , i could n't enjoy her because i was having problems , and i was sick , " she says			0
as she tried to cope with her new reality , she turned to food			0
over the next four years , her weight ballooned			1
food , inactivity and even her heart medicine caused her to put on weight			1
and her growing waistline was not helping her self esteem			0
she became so heavy she could n't bear to step on the scale and refused to pose in photographs with friends			0
at the start of 2012 , she came across a weight - loss challenge on a couponing website			2
the challenge was between a group of strangers online who counted calories to lose weight			1
it did n't seem like something that would strain her heart , so @entity14 decided to join the group 's challenge			1
" i thought i 'd try losing weight with people online			2
i figured if i fail it 's not as bad because i do n't really know them , " she says			0
so she cut her food intake by 500 calories a day , eating only 1,200 calories and religiously documented everything she put in her mouth			0
a chocolate lover , she got rid of all candy from her house			0
and she stopped eating after her daughter			0
" oh the @entity114 fries -- my kid with her happy meals would drive me crazy , " she says			0
" i would eat half her meal because she could n't finish it			0
" but with calorie counting , there was no room for extra food			1
she weighed in at 260 pounds at the start of the challenge			2
in six weeks she had dropped 20 pounds , winning the weight - loss competition			1
it was a boost of confidence that motivated her to take control of her life			2
she was determined to get to a healthy weight not only for herself , but also for her daughter			2
" my mom and grandfather both died in their forties because of this , and they did n't know they had heart disease , " she said			1
" a lot of people have the same kind of thing i have			0
it 's like a totally different ball game when you 're trying to lose weight			1
" she made counting calories a routine , logging her intake on sites like caloriecount.com or on her mobile phone			2
but she wanted to do more			0
she wanted to be active but did n't know how			0
she asked her cardiologist about light exercise ; he thought it would be a good idea to try			0
so @entity14 strapped on her tennis shoes and put @entity15 in a stroller and walked down the street			1
that was as far as she would go			0
the fear that her heart would act up made her turn around			2
but those first few steps were just the beginning			0
she slowly built the courage to walk a little further each day around her neighborhood , paying close attention to her body			0
soon , she was able to jump on the elliptical for five minutes at a time , building up her endurance			0
" you got to go slowly , " she says			0
losing weight was gradual for @entity14 , who is 5 ' 8 "			1
it took her two years to reach her goal weight of 135 pounds on october 2013			1
@entity14 , who started a new job at a patient advocacy company , now focuses on maintaining her weight			1
she joined a gym to build muscle and goes every day			0
she still lives with her heart condition , but losing the weight has helped keep her heath in check			1
" some days i go to the gym and my heart is n't cooperating			2
it feels like it is rattling around , " she says			0
" you never push yourself with this disease			2
they tell you to push yourself at the gym , but you have to listen to your body			0
" @entity14 currently takes only half her heart medication			1
her cardiologist attributes her improved health to her weight loss			2
she says the entire process changed the way she views life			1
" when i was diagnosed with heart disease , i literally thought that my life was over , " she said			1
" but the huge weight - loss proved to me i could still do what i set my mind to			2
life was n't over ; it could be wonderful			0

when @entity1 was diagnosed with congenital heart disease her life changed
since exercising could strain her heart , @entity14 started calorie counting to lose weight
it took two years for her to lose *125* pounds , but now that she is lighter her heart is healthier
