oil giant @entity1 has canceled plans to drill in the @entity4 waters off @entity5 this year after a federal court ruling put the company 's multibillion - dollar project on hold , the company said thursday			1
it 's the second year @entity1 has postponed its push to drill in the @entity12 , where it began exploratory drilling in 2012			1
the effort caused widespread concern among environmentalists and native alaskan communities , who have taken the company and the @entity22 government to court to stop it			2
" the lack of a clear path forward and an associated timeline makes it impossible to commit the resources needed to explore safely in 2014 , " @entity1 spokesman @entity23 said			1
a federal appeals court ruled last week that federal regulators used " an unrealistically low estimate " of the amount of oil @entity1 might be able to produce when calculating the project 's impact on the @entity4 environment			1
environmental groups cheered the company 's decision to sit out the year			0
" @entity4 offshore drilling is fraught with dangers that defy rational economic development , " @entity40 , the head of the @entity42 's @entity4 programs , said in a written statement			0
" @entity1 's decision to abandon efforts to drill in this remote and extreme environment in 2014 means that @entity5 communities and wildlife will be able to go at least another year without the added threat of spills from exploratory drilling			1
" @entity1 began exploration in summer 2012			2
but it skipped 2013 after some high - profile snags , including the grounding of a drill barge that was being towed back to the continental @entity22 at the end of the 2012 season			1
@entity23 said the company is frustrated by the obstacles it has faced but will continue working with the @entity64 while it reviews its options			0
" every year we are delayed from understanding the oil and gas resources under the @entity12 only further delays the potential creation of tens of thousands of jobs , billions of dollars in tax revenue and much - needed new oil for the @entity76 , " he said			0
the shrinking of @entity4 sea ice , which hit record summer lows in 2012 , has created new opportunities for energy exploration in the region			0
climate researchers say that decrease is a symptom of a warming climate , caused largely by the combustion of carbon - rich fossil fuels like oil -- a conclusion that 's politically controversial but accepted as fact by most scientists			0
@entity1 's plans also were delayed by the 2010 @entity96 disaster , which killed 11 rig workers and unleashed an undersea gusher in the @entity99 that took three months to cap			2
the company says it 's working at far less depth and lower pressures than those involved in that accident .			0

@entity1 says it lacks " a clear path forward " for drilling off @entity5
