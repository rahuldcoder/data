-- the first @entity2 case of mad cow disease in six years sparked fears of illness that prompted at least one major @entity7 retailer to suspend the sale of @entity2 beef			1
however , public health officials said the risk of @entity2 contracting the disease is low , given that the affected dairy cow in central @entity14 never entered the human food chain and did not contract bovine spongiform encephalopathy through contaminated animal feed			1
" it was never presented for slaughter for human consumption , so at no time presented a risk to the food supply or human health , " said @entity18 , the @entity19 's chief veterinarian			1
what you need to know about mad cow disease in @entity7 , one of the world 's largest importers of @entity2 beef , the discovery of bovine spongiform encephalopathy led retailer @entity36 to remove @entity2 beef from store shelves			1
" currently , the sale of @entity2 beef is temporarily suspended to ease our customers from anxiety , " @entity38 said			1
the @entity7 government said it will step up checks on @entity2 beef imports but not halt them for now			1
in 2010 , @entity7 imported 125,000 tons of @entity2 beef , a 97 % increase from the year before , the @entity2 @entity19 said			1
@entity46 , food safety attorney for the @entity48 , said there is no need for consumers to take precautions based on this case			0
" a case of a single cow with bovine spongiform encephalopathy is not a reason for significant concern on the part of consumers , and there is no reason to believe the beef or milk supply is unsafe , " she said			1
" if the cow were exposed to the typical strain of @entity67 via animal feed -- and the government says that 's not the case here -- that would have represented a significant failure , " she said			2
she said the government would have had a difficult time tracking down other cattle that may have been eating the same feed because the nation lacks an effective animal identification program			0
@entity79 , the director of the @entity81 office of @entity82 , said the government 's testing program is not sufficient to ensure that @entity2 beef is safe			1
" the @entity19 tests only about 40,000 of the 35 million cows that are killed every year , " she told @entity0 's @entity85			1
" that 's just a tiny fraction			0
... they 're not looking very hard for mad cow disease , and so they 're not finding it very often			1
" in a statement issued to @entity0 in 2006 , the @entity19 said it does not support 100 % testing because the disease is difficult to detect in young cattle , the primary source of beef in the @entity2			1
" recognizing the international scientific consensus that @entity67 ( @entity67 ) is a disease that is not detected in young animals , there is n't any nation in the world that requires 100 - percent testing for @entity67 , " the statement said			1
but @entity79 said the agency has also vetoed efforts by private companies to carry out their own testing , at their own expense , and then labeling their product as @entity67 - free			2
" those companies in the @entity2 that want to test their own meat have been prohibited from doing so by the @entity19 , " she said			1
" we think that 's wrong			0
" the cow 's carcass was at a @entity120 rendering facility in @entity121 , @entity14 , according to company executive vice president @entity122			2
the company renders animal byproducts and had randomly selected the animal for testing on april 18 , he said			0
" we are in the business of removing dead animals from dairies in the @entity130 , " he said			0
" as part of that program , we participate in the @entity67 surveillance program			0
" the sample was sent to the @entity135 for initial testing , which came back inconclusive			0
it was then sent to the @entity19 's laboratory in @entity139 , @entity140 , where it tested positive , the agency said			1
the carcass was in quarantine wednesday			0
" we 're waiting now for @entity19 to tell us how to dispose of it , " @entity122 said			1
a @entity19 spokesman , @entity144 , said the agency was not releasing the name of the dairy " because it 's our policy not to when we are in the middle of the investigation			2
" but rep. @entity151 , @entity14 , said it was from a dairy farm in @entity153			0
" we did trace it back to a farm , " @entity151 said , adding that the discovery " demonstrates the strength of our surveillance system			0
" in a statement , @entity161 secretary @entity160 said @entity161 veterinarians were working with the @entity19 to determine whether other cows are at risk			2
" feed restrictions in place in @entity14 and around the country for the last 15 years minimize that risk to the greatest degree possible , " she said			0
eating contaminated meat or some other animal products from cattle that have @entity67 is thought to be the cause of @entity176			0
the fatal brain disease was blamed for the deaths of 150 people in @entity180 , where there was an outbreak in the 1980s and 1990s			2
learn more about @entity176 disease in people , symptoms of the disease include psychiatric and behavioral changes , movement deficits , memory disturbances and cognitive impairments			1
@entity67 can cause infected animals to display nervousness or aggression , difficulty in coordination and standing up , decreased milk production or weight loss			0
it is usually transmitted between cows through the practice of recycling bovine carcasses for meat and bone meal protein , which is fed to other cattle			0
in this case , the @entity203 reported that the cow had a rare form of @entity67 not likely carried by contaminated feed			2
agriculture secretary @entity208 said monday that he remains confident in the health of the national herd and the safety of beef and dairy products			2
" this is an atypical case , which means it 's not connected in any way , shape or form to feed			0
... a very rare circumstance and situation , " @entity208 said			0
" it can just sort of come up and pop up -- sometimes it 's genetic			0
" since 2004 , the @entity19 has removed the brain and the spinal column , the parts suspected of causing mad cow disease in humans , from the food system			1
unlike most other meat - borne illnesses , such as those caused by e. - coli bacteria , cooking does not kill the infectious agent that causes mad cow disease			1
consumers who wish to exercise extra caution can follow the advice presented by the web - based consumer advocacy group @entity237 , which advises the avoidance of brains , neck bones and beef cheeks , bone marrow and cuts of beef that are sold on the bone			2
the group also says to choose boneless cuts of meat and ground beef only if it has been ground in the store			0
" evidence shows that our systems and safeguards to prevent @entity67 are working , as are similar actions taken by countries around the world , " said the @entity19 's @entity18			2
last year , 29 cases of @entity67 were reported worldwide , down 99 % from the peak of 37,311 cases in 1992			0
" this is directly attributable to the impact and effectiveness of feed bans as a primary control measure for the disease , " he said			0
the @entity19 confirmed the first case of mad cow disease in @entity2 on december 23 , 2003 , in a cow born in @entity271 , @entity267 , in april 1997 , only four months before the @entity2 and @entity267 began banning the use of brain and spinal cord tissue in cattle feed			1
a second @entity2 case was confirmed june 24 , 2005 , and a third on march 13 , 2006			2
the infected @entity14 cow confirmed tuesday was @entity2 's fourth case of mad cow disease			1
@entity0 's @entity280 , @entity281 , @entity282 and @entity283 contributed to this report			0
