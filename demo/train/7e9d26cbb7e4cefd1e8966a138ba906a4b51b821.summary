-- when @entity2 lost her husband , @entity3 , to a brain tumor , she was devastated			1
but it was n't until she visited her old neighbors in @entity7 , @entity8 , that she began to question the cause of his death			1
back in the community where she and @entity3 had lived for almost 40 years , @entity2 learned two of her former neighbors also had brain tumors			1
" it was like a light bulb went off , " @entity2 recalls			1
" how can that many have cancer living right next door to each other ? " since then , more brain cancer cases have turned up , 30 in all , among current and former residents of @entity7 , a community of about 1,000 residents in northern @entity8 , not far from the @entity27 state line			1
@entity2 and others in @entity7 are now pointing the finger at a chemical plant a mile up the road in @entity32 , @entity8			1
for decades , they say , the @entity34 plant dumped , spilled and leaked thousands of pounds of vinyl chloride and other toxic chemicals , poisoning the water and air around @entity7			1
" i do n't think there 's been a bigger brain cancer cluster outside the workplace -- ever , " says @entity40 , attorney for 31 @entity42 plaintiffs now suing @entity34			1
in addition to the brain cancer cases , there is one plaintiff alleging her liver damage resulted from environmental pollution			1
the company denies making anyone sick			1
@entity2 's case is the first to go to trial , with jury selection set to begin wednesday in @entity57 , @entity58			1
' @entity3 did n't have a chance ' @entity60 died in june 2004 , a month after learning that he had a deadly glioblastoma brain tumor			2
" @entity3 did n't have a chance , " @entity2 says			1
" what they did was very wrong			0
they played with people 's lives			2
i lost a husband , who was my best friend			0
the kids lost their father			0
the grandkids lost their grandfather , " she added , barely able to get her words out through her tears			0
@entity34 says even though the cancer cases are close together , they are random			1
" there is no cluster in @entity42 , " says @entity79 , attorney for @entity34			1
" if you draw circles around selected cases , you can always draw the conclusion of something unusual			2
" brain and central nervous system cancers strike 7.6 per 100,000 people in the @entity89 , according to the @entity90			2
an estimated 22,020 men and women in the @entity89 will get diagnosed with these cancers this year			0
a month after the lawsuit was filed in 2006 , the @entity94 in @entity8 concluded there was no cluster of cancer cases in @entity7			1
the @entity99 did its own analysis and agreed			0
originally a dairy the @entity34 site produces polymers , adhesives , resins and sealants on a 120 - acre site originally built as a dairy operation in 1916 and converted to chemical manufacturing in the early 1940s			1
the facility has disposed its waste off site since 1978 , but vinyl chloride , trichloroethylene , or @entity115 , and vinylidene chloride have all been found in nearby groundwater , according to the @entity99			0
the @entity89 @entity118 calls vinyl chloride " a known carcinogen			0
" long - term exposure to vinyl chloride on the job increases workers ' risk of cancers of the liver , brain , lung and blood , according to the @entity131			2
breathing or drinking high levels of @entity115 can damage the central nervous system , liver and lungs and also cause an abnormal heartbeat , according to the agency			2
breathing high levels of vinylidene chloride can affect the central nervous system , liver and kidneys , the agency says			2
but @entity79 , the @entity34 attorney , says the plume of contaminated groundwater is moving away from @entity7 and does not affect any homes or residential wells			1
" nobody disputes that it exists			0
but that is not going anywhere near @entity42 , " @entity79 says			0
" no agency has ever concluded any resident was exposed to dangerous chemicals			1
" to put residents ' fears at ease , @entity34 has offered to pay up to $ 50,000 to test residents ' wells			1
there are about 400 homes with private wells in the village			0
the company has also offered to pay $ 5,000 to monitor the air for vinyl chloride and $ 50,000 for an independent analysis of theories of possible vinyl chloride exposure			0
' a beautiful place to live ' when @entity2 and @entity60 moved to @entity7 in august 1960 , they saw a picturesque community with other young families			1
" it was a beautiful place to live			0
we lived by a beach			0
we had such close neighbors			0
the whole subdivision was like a family , " says @entity2 , who raised five children there			1
@entity60 worked as general manager at a die cast plant in nearby @entity184 , @entity8			1
on sundays , the husbands would go down to the beach to play baseball			0
the wives would pack picnic baskets and watch			0
looking back , @entity2 says there were warning signs			1
in the summer , a terrible odor would sometimes force them to close their windows , she says			0
" we did n't put two and two together until we found there were so many other neighbors with cancers , " @entity2 says			2
after her husband died , @entity2 's children bought her a plane ticket to return to @entity8 , from @entity203 , @entity204 , where she and her husband had retired			1
visiting old friends , she learned former next - door neighbor @entity207 also has a brain tumor , an oligodendroglioma			2
so does @entity210 , who lives on the other side of the @entity212 , two doors down from the @entity215 ' former home			0
@entity207 , 49 , a truck driver and jewelry store owner , says he never gave the @entity34 plant a second thought until @entity2 came back to town			1
" it was really just a place i drove past , " says @entity207 , who now suffers from headaches , seizures and memory loss			0
" i had dreams and aspirations , " he adds			0
" now when i look to the future it 's really sort of a blank			2
i ca n't really expect to have one			0
that 's a daily struggle			0
" @entity210 , 69 , a retired general contractor , says he hopes the lawsuit will bring out the truth of what happened to the people of @entity7			2
" it was a cover - up from the get - go as far as i 'm concerned , " says @entity210 , who also suffers from seizures			0
@entity2 says she hopes the lawsuit , which asks for unspecified compensatory and punitive compensation , will make companies think twice			2
" what they did was wrong , and if this will save one person 's life and they wo n't do this again , it will be worth it , " she says			0
the trial is expected to last 10 to 12 weeks .			0
