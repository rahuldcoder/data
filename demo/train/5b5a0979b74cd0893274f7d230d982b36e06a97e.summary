@entity0 -- a @entity0 medical examiner 's office said saturday that a body discovered this week along a remote stretch of @entity7 beach was that of @entity8 , the missing @entity9 woman whose disappearance led investigators to 10 sets of human remains and the hunt for a possible serial killer			1
@entity16 , 24 , vanished in may 2010 after visiting a client			1
the @entity20 resident , police said , had advertised for prostitution services on websites such as @entity23			1
her body was uncovered tuesday in the wooded marshes of @entity27 's @entity26			1
the cause of her death has not yet been determined , police said in a statement			1
" our condolences to the @entity16 family and her friends , " said police commissioner @entity32			1
" we hope this brings them closure and peace			0
" investigators cut through a fresh thicket of brush and bramble along @entity7 's southern shoreline earlier this week , expanding their investigation across a recently drained swampland on the barrier island before uncovering @entity16 's remains			1
they were found at 9:14 a.m. tuesday by police divers and detectives riding atop amphibious vehicles , roughly a quarter - mile from where her purse was found a week before			1
the purse was discovered near a cell phone , shoes and a pair of jeans , according to investigators			2
after @entity16 vanished last year , the hunt for her led police seven months later to four bodies stuffed in bushes along a quarter - mile stretch of @entity66 in @entity26			1
all four were later identified as women and , like @entity16 , had advertised for prostitution services online			1
the bodies were found in various stages of decomposition			2
additional remains were later uncovered in neighboring @entity73 and in @entity74 , about 40 miles east of @entity0			0
unlike other victims found scattered across the two counties , @entity16 is not thought to have been murdered by the suspected serial killer , police have said			1
but on thursday , top law enforcement officials publicly sparred over competing theories in the case			0
@entity32 has said a single person is likely responsible for the alleged murders			0
" the theory is now that we 're dealing with one serial killer , " he told reporters in november , reiterating his position during a county legislative hearing on thursday			0
moments later during the same hearing , @entity27 district attorney @entity91 took the stand and rejected @entity32 's statement			2
" i very very much disagree with that theory , " said @entity91			0
" i do n't know of anybody who , in the police department , who is actively conducting the investigation who shares that theory			2
" quite frankly , i do n't know why there was a unilateral change in theories			0
" in may , @entity91 told reporters that a collection of human remains were not believed to be connected to the first four victims			0
@entity32 , who initially told reporters the bodies could be the work of a killer or multiple killers , later pointed to a similar dumping ground as one common aspect of the investigation that could support the notion of a single killer			2
authorities have sifted through more than 1,000 tips related to the case			0
but it 's unclear whether that has shed any light on an investigation that continues to garner national attention			0
in june , police upped the ante in their search for a culprit			0
the reward for information leading to an arrest -- once topping out at $ 5,000 -- was raised five-fold , making it the largest offered in @entity27 history in an apparent bid to fill out a case that some fear has gone cold .			0

authorities confirm that a body discovered this week was that of @entity8
police say the cause of her death has not yet been determined
@entity16 's may 2010 disappearance led to the discovery of other bodies on @entity7
