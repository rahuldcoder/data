-- @entity1 began the defense of his @entity4 crown with a straight sets victory over @entity7 @entity6 at @entity8 on monday			1
the world number two took just an hour and 24 minutes to dispatch @entity6 6 - 1 6 - 1 6 - 3 in their first round match on the @entity12			1
@entity1 , who beat @entity14 's @entity13 in last year 's final , is chasing his 17th grand slam title and could not have made a more convincing start			2
" i thought i played great , " the @entity19 maestro told the official @entity4 website			0
" i was able to keep on pressing , you know , put him on the back foot ... that it worked was obviously great			0
but at the end , i 'm obviously very happy			0
" @entity4 : from nomad to nouveau riche the unfortunate @entity6 , who played world number one and then defending champion @entity31 in the second round last year , was always in trouble after losing the opener 6 - 1 in just 22 minutes			1
he trailed 3 - 0 in the second before daring to break @entity1 's service for the first and only time only to then lose the next three games			2
world number 97 @entity6 offered stiffer resistance in the third set , but a single break of service was enough for @entity1 to secure a second round match against @entity45 after the @entity46 beat @entity47 of @entity48 6 - 7 6 - 2 6 - 4 6 - 2			1
while @entity1 breezed through , there were opening round defeats for two seeds , @entity52 of @entity53 and @entity54 of the @entity55			2
should the @entity4 be played in february ? on the comeback trail after injury , 23rd seed @entity52 lost in four sets to @entity61 @entity60 , who won 6 - 3 4 - 6 7 - 6 6 - 4			1
@entity54 , ranked 18th , was involved in a thrilling five - setter against world no. 72 @entity64 from @entity65			0
@entity64 trailed two sets to one on court two , but cheered by a big contingent from @entity65 , hit back to win 5 - 7 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 1 7 - 6			2
@entity69 looked set to join the list of upsets when he trailed young @entity74 @entity73 two sets to love			0
but the popular @entity46 , who is seeded 12th , battled back on the @entity75 for a stunning 6 - 7 2 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 2 6 - 1 victory			2
on the same court , eighth seed @entity77 of the @entity55 , showed fine early form with a 6 - 1 6 - 2 6 - 2 victory over @entity82 of the @entity83			1
the first night session in @entity8 saw a comfortable straight sets win for third seed and 2009 champion @entity87			1
the @entity88 eased past @entity89 of @entity90 6 - 1 6 - 3 6 - 1 as he bids to reach his second grand slam final in succession after losing to @entity31 at the @entity93			1
it earns him a clash against @entity97 's @entity96 and @entity87 urged fans to be on their best behavior			0
previous @entity101 opens have been marred by clashes between @entity97 and @entity88 supporters after the war between the two countries in the 1990s			0
" well , i just hope that it 's not gon na happen , " @entity87 said			0
" it 's a very bad image that they send for their countries , you know			0
