-- the devastating tornado that killed 124 people in @entity4 this week puts the @entity5 on track for a record - breaking year -- despite improved forecasting , warning systems and public awareness , weather experts say			1
by 7:20 p.m. tuesday , the death toll in @entity11 had reached 124 , making it the single deadliest tornado since the @entity13 began keeping such records 61 years ago			1
the tornado in @entity11 brought the number of people who have died in @entity5 tornadoes to 489 so far this year			1
the figure could escalate as rescue workers continue digging through rubble from sunday 's tornado in @entity11 , @entity4			1
the deadliest tornado year on record is 1925 , which had 794 deaths , according to the @entity27			1
the number of fatalities so far this year is more than 8 1/2 times the average number for an entire year -- 56 , according to @entity0 meteorologist @entity30			2
with all the advancements in storm technology , the question is simple : why ? " that 's the question of 2011 , " said @entity34 of the @entity35			1
" why have so many people died in these tornadoes ? that 's the open question			1
it 's partly because of the strength of these tornadoes			1
also because they 've hit populated areas			0
" @entity30 said the brute force of some tornadoes might just be too severe for many structures			2
" some tornadoes , you just ca n't survive them , " he said			0
" they 're just too big			0
" since 1875 , the average number of deaths from tornadoes has actually decreased -- from about 200 to 55 a year , @entity30 said			1
this year is a sharp anomaly			0
in addition , the number of killer tornadoes is higher in 2011 -- 51 deadly tornadoes have touched down in the @entity5 this year , compared to an average of 22 killer tornadoes in the past			1
that 's counting two more tornadoes in @entity4 tuesday night			2
and it 's only may			0
but early statistics on @entity5 tornadoes have been spotty			1
because twisters were not measured the same way they are now , experts do n't know whether the 1925 tri-state tornado that killed about 695 people in @entity4 , @entity73 and @entity74 was actually a single funnel or many -- which is why it 's not officially considered the deadliest single tornado			1
the weekend tornado in @entity11 stirred memories of two fatal twisters that struck in @entity81 last month			2
one tornado hit @entity83 and @entity84 , killing 78 people , and another struck @entity86 and @entity87 , killing 61			2
while many cities in tornado - prone areas have tornado sirens , the alarms sometimes get ignored			0
" the sirens always go off , so no one thought anything of it , " @entity11 resident @entity92 said			0
" where we were , nobody really seemed like they were in much of a shock			0
" but @entity30 said even if people take all possible precautions , a tornado can still leave fatalities			2
" if you get hit by something the size of a 225 mph storm , it is not survivable , " he said			0
" and that is not to scare anyone			0
but the people that did it right are not to blame			0
" @entity0 's @entity115 and @entity116 contributed to this report .			0

at least 489 people have died in @entity5 tornadoes so far this year

the strengths and *locations* of 2011 's twisters could help *explain* the high death toll
