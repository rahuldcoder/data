-- oil leaking from a container ship that ran aground on a reef off the pristine east coast of @entity6 's north island has begun washing ashore			1
clumps of oil have been found on @entity10 beach in the @entity11			1
@entity6 's oil spill response agency , @entity13 ( @entity14 ) , is advising people to avoid the beach for health reasons			1
oil began leaking from the @entity18 , a @entity20 - flagged vessel , after it struck the @entity21 , about 12 nautical miles off the coast of @entity23 , on the @entity24 , on wednesday , creating a five - km ( three - mile ) slick			1
efforts to recover oil from the grounded ship , now heading south down the coast , are being hampered by high winds and strong swells			1
approximately 10 tonnes of fuel oil was transferred to tanks on board a barge before the recovery operation was suspended on monday			1
most of the 1,700 cubic meters ( 450,000 gallons ) of fuel carried by the ship has remained within the vessel 's hull			2
however , the ship has sustained some damage from current movements and has leaked a significant amount of oil , which @entity14 estimates to be 130 - 350 tonnes			2
@entity14 said dispersants are being tested on the oil that has leaked			0
however , there are sea swells of up to four meters , which can make it difficult for the dispersant to work			0
worsening weather prompted the ship 's crew to be evacuated as a precautionary measure after a mayday call was made on tuesday			1
@entity57 architects and salvage experts on board the @entity18 are monitoring the vessel and have placed sensors to provide advance warning should the ship 's structure come under too much stress			1
@entity14 has established a one - kilometer maritime exclusion zone around the ship due to the health risk posed by the oil spill			1
national on - scene commander @entity70 said the operation to remove the oil from the ship , led by @entity74 , would be complex			2
" there is no way of doing this quickly , " he said			0
a rescue center has been set up in the city of @entity23 to clean oil from animals affected by the spill and @entity14 has 12 teams working to assist oiled wildlife			1
nine birds have been recovered -- seven little blue penguins and two shags , the agency said			0
about 300 defense force personnel are on standby for a shore cleanup if needed , the agency said			0
officials fear the stricken ship may spill additional oil as its condition deteriorates			2
" i think we 'd expect that at some point to have further problems and potentially even break up , " transport minister @entity96 told broadcaster @entity98			0
@entity102 expressed " extreme concern " about the spill and urged the government to avoid using further toxic dispersants			0
" this is an unfortunate illustration of just how difficult it is to deal with oil spills at sea , " the organization 's @entity107 said			0
" even a slow , and relatively accessible , oil spill like this one has clearly stretched @entity6 's response capability to its limits			1
" it is also a potential disaster for the blue whales and dolphins presently calving in the area , as well as numerous other marine species			0
" @entity6 prime minister @entity123 said two inquiries had been launched into the incident to discover how the ship hit the reef			2
" this is a very large ship , that in calm waters has hit an extremely well documented reef , " he told @entity98			0
" some serious questions need to be answered about why that happened and who is responsible , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity134 and @entity135 contributed to this report .			0
