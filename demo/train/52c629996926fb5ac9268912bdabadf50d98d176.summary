@entity1 's refusal to release tax returns in the critical years of his income accumulation has done little to dispel the legitimate concern that arises from hints buried in his scant disclosure to date : did he augment his wealth through highly aggressive tax stratagems of questionable validity ? opinion : why wo n't @entity1 release more tax returns ? one relevant line of inquiry , largely ignored so far , is to examine what exists in the public record regarding his attitude toward tax compliance and tax avoidance			1
while this examination is hampered because his dealings through his private equity company , @entity25 , are kept shrouded , there are other indicators			0
a key troubling public manifestation of @entity1 's apparent insensitivity to tax obligations is his role in @entity32 's abusive tax shelter activity , as previously reported by @entity33 in @entity34			1
@entity1 has had a close , long - standing , personal and business connection with @entity32 and its founders			1
he served as a member of the @entity32 board of directors for many years			2
from 1993 to 1998 , @entity1 was the head of the audit committee of the @entity32 board			1
during that period , @entity32 engaged in a series of complex and high - profile maneuvers , including " @entity46 , " a notoriously abusive prepackaged tax shelter that investment banks and accounting firms marketed to corporations such as @entity32			1
in this respect , @entity32 was in the vanguard of a then - emerging corporate tax shelter bubble that substantially undermined the entire corporate tax system			1
@entity46 and its related shelters represented perhaps the largest tax avoidance scheme in history , costing the @entity58 many billions in lost corporate tax revenues			0
in response , the government initiated legal challenges that resulted in complete disallowance of the losses claimed by @entity32 and other corporations			0
in addition , the @entity46 transaction was listed by the @entity68 as an abusive transaction , requiring specific disclosure and subject to heavy penalties			0
statutory penalties were also made more stringent to deter future tax shelter activity			1
finally , the government brought successful criminal prosecutions against a number of individuals involved in @entity46 and related transactions not associated with @entity32 , including principals at major law and accounting firms			0
in his key role as chairman of the @entity32 board 's audit committee , @entity1 approved the firm 's reporting of fictional tax losses exceeding $ 70 million generated by its @entity46 transaction			1
his endorsement of this stratagem provides insight into @entity1 's professional ethics and attitude toward tax compliance obligations			1
like other prepackaged corporate tax shelters of that era , @entity32 's @entity46 transaction was an entirely artificial transaction , bearing no relationship to its business			1
its sole purpose was to create a gigantic tax loss out of thin air without any economic risk , cost or loss -- other than the fee @entity32 paid the promoter			2
the @entity46 transaction was vulnerable to attack on at least two grounds			0
first , the transaction 's promoters and consumers relied on a strained technical statutory analysis			0
second , the @entity46 deal violated the fundamental tax principle that the tax law ignores transactions unless they have a motivating business purpose and a substantial nontax economic effect			0
in the @entity32 case , the @entity68 raised both arguments and won on the first interpretive issue			0
the @entity124 ( affirmed by the @entity125 ) rejected @entity32 's technical analysis , finding no reliable argument or authority to support it			2
the court therefore did not need to reach the issue of business purpose and economic substance			0
in subsequent decisions , involving similar transactions but other parties , the courts have sustained the second line of attack as well , finding the claimed losses to be fictitious			0
the complete judicial rejection of the @entity46 tax scheme was entirely predictable			0
in mid- 1994 , for example , roughly contemporaneously with @entity32 's execution of its @entity46 trade and well before @entity32 filed its return claiming the artificial loss , the highly respected @entity147 of the @entity148 filed a public comment with the @entity150 and @entity68 urging rejection of the technical claims made by promoters of such schemes			2
in his key position as head of the board 's audit committee , @entity1 was required under the securities laws and his fiduciary duties to review the transaction			2
in fact , it has been publicly reported that @entity1 was the @entity163 member most acquainted with the transaction and to whom the other board members turned for advice			0
this makes sense because aggressive tax - driven financial engineering was a large part of what @entity1 ( and @entity25 ) did for a living			2
for these reasons , it is fair to hold him accountable for @entity32 's spurious tax reporting			2
@entity1 's campaign staff has attempted to deflect responsibility , arguing that he relied on @entity32 's tax department and advisers			1
in a transaction of this magnitude , sensitivity and questionableness , the prudent step would be to secure advice to the audit committee and the board from experienced and independent tax counsel , who would certainly have cautioned that the @entity32 position was risky and not supported by precedent or proper statutory interpretation			2
moreover , on the key issue of the business purpose and economic substance , @entity1 was , or should have been , aware of the facts that the transaction had its genesis solely in tax avoidance and was a " marketed " tax shelter			1
he had an insider 's perspective on the motivation and lack of substance in the transaction , as well as the financial sophistication to understand the tax avoidance involved			0
@entity1 failed in his duties to @entity32 and its shareholders and acted to undermine the fairness of the tax system			1
no one could accuse @entity1 of lacking the intelligence and analytical skills to have dealt with this transaction appropriately			0
indeed , his strengths in this regard were the reason the other board members relied on him			0
what emerges from this window into corporate tax compliance behavior is the picture of an executive who was willing to go to the edge , if not beyond , to bend the rules to seek an unfair advantage , and then hide behind the advice of so - called experts to deflect criticism when a scheme backfires			1
@entity235 puts @entity236 in a bind over @entity1 's taxes			1

when @entity1 was audit chair at @entity32 , company engaged in abusive tax shelter
@entity244 , @entity245 : @entity32 tie shows @entity1 's professional ethics
they say @entity1 *displays* a *consistent* highly aggressive attitude towards tax obligations
@entity244 , @entity245 : @entity1 was willing to bend the rules to seek an unfair tax advantage
