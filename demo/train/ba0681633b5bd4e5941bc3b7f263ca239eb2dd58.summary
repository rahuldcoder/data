-- @entity1 has officially launched its new @entity3 ad format , allowing site visitors to avoid watching ads they 're not interested in			1
users will now be able to look for a countdown button that will let them skip an ad after it plays for five seconds			0
in some cases , viewers will be able to select which ad to watch out of three pre-roll options			2
as we reported back in june , @entity1 had been experimenting with the button -- allowing users to stop ads from playing -- for awhile			1
the other option , allowing users to select which ad to watch , is similar to the one offered on @entity20 , where long - form video content has typically had a stronger presence			1
it looks like some advertisers are reacting positively to the new ad format			1
some have said @entity3 is a cost - effective advertising option that provides them with a better ability to target their audience			0
" thus far , we 've seen about a 40 percent view - through rate and since we only pay when potential customers actually watch a video , we have more control over our budget , " said @entity30 , director of online marketing for @entity32 , in a statement to @entity36 's @entity35 blog			0
@entity3 , which is presently only available to advertisers with managed accounts , is n't all that widespread on @entity1 just yet			2
advertisers can decide whether they 'd like to use @entity3 or stick with the usual non-skippable platform			0
meanwhile , @entity1 says it 's working on providing more choice and control in advertising to its users			0
