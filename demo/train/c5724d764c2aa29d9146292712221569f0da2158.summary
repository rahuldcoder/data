-- imagine an apple - cheeked telephone operator from the early 1900s happily plugging in wires to connect @entity3 to @entity4 now imagine a kajillion operators doing that at the same time			1
that 's kind of how the @entity7 works , linking up humans so that we 're now a mere 4.74 degrees of separation away from any human on @entity12 ( take that , @entity14 ! )			1
much of that interaction is unintentional , the smashing of two particles that happen to sideswipe each other while commenting on the same @entity20 video or clicking through @entity22 profiles			1
but sometimes we purposely reach out to join hands across the @entity24			2
and , as with every social interaction online , some people seriously foul up the digital outreach			1
here , some basic guidelines for polite e-introductions			1
when e-mailing a complete stranger err on the side of formality , using " @entity33 ( name ) " over " hey ! " explain exactly what you want out of an e-mail correspondence ( " to tell you about my small business " or " to see if you 'd be open to a brief informational interview " makes a lot more sense than " to network with you " ) and add a little flattery to sweeten the deal ( i.e. , why you found the target worth e-mailing )			1
keep the whole thing to a paragraph or less and hope for the best			2
should it go unanswered , you can just blame his or her overtaxed inbox			2
when contacting someone you 've met begin by reminding them of how you met with an identifying detail			2
if it was a networking event , for example , simply announcing , " it was great to meet you at the anachronistic @entity62 - themed mixer last week ! " wo n't do the trick			0
you 've got to add something like , " i really enjoyed chatting about the true definition of a beignet and your years at @entity67 " when you know @entity3 and @entity69 and are introducing the two several times in life , you 'll have to play the role of connector , answering a friend 's plea to connect her to someone else in your circle			0
this is the kind of delicate social dance that used to need much instruction -- witness the flipping long chapter on doing it in real life within @entity84 's 1922 tome , " etiquette			1
" when connecting , say , a nonprofit employee who 's planning to ask your d - list celebrity friend to participate in a phone - a - thon , the most polite option is to privately contact the fading star first and ask if she 'd mind if you linked them up			1
if you 're confident that everyone involved will be happy with the connection , though , you can just go ahead and put them both on a " @entity96 , meet has - been " type e-mail and then slip graciously into the background as they have their conversation			0
oh , and pay attention to which e-mail addresses you 're giving out -- if you 're connecting a job seeker with an employed friend for networking purposes , he 'll probably prefer to be contacted via his work address , not his private one			0
when asking your friend to introduce you to someone after your benevolent contact has made the intro , take him off the reply - all chain ( so he is n't trapped in the e-mail crossfire as you two discuss the cupcakes - for - kitten - spaying fundraiser you 're planning ) , and separately write to her to say thanks			0
then follow the immortal words of the @entity121 and just let it be			0
do n't ask her to follow up with you if the d - lister does n't respond , and do n't blame her for a lack of response			0
again , we 're all drowning in e-mails , @entity131 messages , @entity127 notes and other beeping and blooping messages			0
if that person ca n't help , just go back to the drawing board -- the one with a kajillion operators connecting humans at dizzying rates .			0
