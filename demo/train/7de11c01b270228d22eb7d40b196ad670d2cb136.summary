-- for @entity3 , tracking down his grandfather 's killer was not his original mission			1
" i was just putting together an old family story ... and these serendipitous events happened , and we accidentally caught him , " @entity3 , of @entity5 , @entity6 , told @entity0 in a phone interview wednesday			2
that " old family story " focuses on two men : @entity13 -- a grandfather that @entity3 never knew -- and a drifter named @entity15			1
according to the @entity17 , on april 4 , 1951 , @entity16 picked up a hitchhiker near @entity19 , @entity20			1
the hitchhiker was @entity15 , then a 19 - year - old drifter who was carrying a loaded gun that , according to the state , he used to shoot and kill @entity16 on the side of windswept @entity20 road			1
@entity15 took the car and drove to @entity27 , where he was later arrested for the murder , according to the @entity17			2
after several trials and appeals , @entity15 was convicted in @entity20 and sentenced to life in prison , then paroled in 1969 , according to state records			1
less than two years after his parole , @entity15 was listed by the @entity17 as " absconded			2
and that is where the " old family story " stopped for nearly 40 years , until last year when @entity3 came across some old newspapers clippings of the murder , which had occurred two years before he was born			2
" so what i knew of it ( was ) ' never pick up a hitchhiker , ' and ' your grandfather died begging for his life , ' " he said			0
" it 's hard -- this is someone i never knew , but as i read , i thought , ' you know , this poor man who happens to be my grandfather -- his death just got kicked to the curb , ' and that became the issue			0
" over the course of a year , @entity3 worked closely with the @entity56 and with @entity58 officials , who supplied him with an old post office box number in @entity60 , @entity61 , and details about @entity15 's unique knuckle tattoos			1
that old address was just enough to give private investigators hired by @entity3 the lead they needed , and the search for @entity15 was on in earnest			1
@entity3 never imagined it would turn out the way it did , though			2
" we thought he was going to be dead , " he said			0
but 78 - year old @entity15 proved them wrong			0
with the help of several private investigators , the search ended when @entity15 was found living as a notary public and operating a wedding chapel in @entity80 , @entity61			1
in the sparsely populated land between @entity84 and @entity85 , @entity15 had " flown under the radar for years , but he did n't fool me " says private investigator @entity81			0
" what i really wanted to do ( was ) check his hands -- for the tattoos			0
i knew that this fellow was probably the one , because i was looking for the letters @entity90 tattooed on his knuckles			0
and i could see he had old stars tattooed on his fingers to cover ' love			0
' i called up to the other investigator and said ' i think i got your guy , ' " said @entity81			0
@entity3 informed @entity56 officials and they worked quickly , contacting local law enforcement in @entity61			1
@entity15 was arrested on tuesday and is now awaiting extradition proceedings to @entity20			1
" whatever the justice system does i 'm happy with it , " said @entity3			0
" whatever happens , happens			0

@entity15 was convicted of killing @entity16 on a *roadside* in 1951
@entity15 was entenced to life in prison , then paroled in 1969 , and disappeared
@entity3 's grandson worked @entity20 authorities and found him in @entity61
@entity15 was arrested tuesday and awaits extradition to @entity20
