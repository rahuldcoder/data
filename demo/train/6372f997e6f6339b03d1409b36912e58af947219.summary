-- @entity1 received the backing of a nation when he was elected for a second term as @entity6 president last month , and now his favorite @entity8 soccer club has also won a significant ballot			1
@entity11 side @entity10 -- the team of choice of the 44th president of the @entity6 -- has been selected as the preferred occupant for @entity16 's @entity15 , the venue which hosted the 2012 @entity19 and @entity18			1
the @entity20 ( @entity20 ) announced on wednesday that the east @entity16 club -- whose stadium is located near to the former @entity25 site in @entity26 -- had beaten off competition from neighboring third - tier team @entity28 , a proposed sports university project and a consortium looking to bring @entity31 to the @entity33 capital			1
" the @entity20 's board unanimously agreed that @entity10 's bid for a concession to play at the @entity15 should be ranked highest of the bids received , and that negotiations should be held with the club on final commercial terms for them to move to the stadium , " read a statement on the organization 's website			1
@entity10 had initially tried to buy the stadium and was named the preferred bidder in february 2011 , but that deal collapsed in october of that year after threats of court action from rival candidates and an independent review of the process			1
the stadium was then offered to potential tenants , and from an initial 16 interested parties the list was cut to four bidders in march 2012			0
despite backing @entity10 's bid for the 80,000 - seater arena , the @entity20 insisted any future tenant would have to accommodate the 2017 @entity61			2
if @entity10 can not cater for track and field , the club would be unable to complete its proposed move to the site			0
" if a football use can be agreed the stadium would be reconfigured to provide a retractable / moveable seating solution so there could be a quick change over between athletics and football use , " the @entity20 said			0
" the legacy corporation recognizes that @entity10 and other parties may not be able to meet the necessary conditions , so is progressing a detailed design for a non-football option			0
this would allow the stadium to be brought back into use as soon as possible			0
" @entity10 's joint chairmen @entity83 and @entity84 hailed wednesday 's announcement as the latest step in realizing the vision they had for the club when they purchased a 50 % shareholding for $ 85 million in 2010			2
" we are ambitious for our great club and aim to set the benchmark for visiting away and neutral football supporters from across the globe to come and enjoy the @entity96 and be part of our @entity11 club experience , " they said in a statement			0
reconstruction work on the stadium , including extending the roof and adding retractable seating , will reportedly cost between $ 210 - 240 million and will be funded by a mix of public money and a $ 64 million loan from the local @entity106			1
@entity10 is expected to contribute $ 24 million to the restructuring of the public - funded stadium , which cost $ 690 million to build			1
the club returned to the @entity8 top flight in august following relegation in 2011 , and has made an encouraging start to the season under the guidance of manager @entity115 , sitting eighth in the table with 22 points from 15 matches			0
@entity1 has reportedly been a fan of " the @entity10 " since a trip to @entity8 several years before his election to office in 2008			2
the club 's supporters have even sung songs in his honor during matches , according to the @entity129 website .			0
