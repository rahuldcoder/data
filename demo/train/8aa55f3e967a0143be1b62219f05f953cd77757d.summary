cartridges and weapons seized from gangsters and drug - traffickers at the @entity17 in @entity18			1
their summit comes at a particularly troubled time for these governments , especially @entity7 , which tallied a record number of drug - related killings last year			1
former @entity26 house speaker @entity25 characterized the battle in @entity7 among drug cartels and with government authorities as a " civil war " on a news program this week			1
but @entity7 is not alone			2
@entity6 has been fighting drug cartels for decades			2
@entity9 has been a center of money - laundering for dug cartels and other organized crime groups for many years			1
and @entity8 has seen its share of slayings and bloodshed			2
" it 's a recognition that there is a shared problem and that they ca n't solve that problem independent of each other , " said @entity39 , a professor of international relations at @entity41 in @entity42 who served as a national security adviser to president @entity44 in the 1970s			0
@entity51 , the director of @entity52 at the @entity53 in @entity54 , says it is " encouraging " that presidents @entity57 of @entity7 , @entity58 of @entity6 , @entity59 of @entity8 and @entity60 of @entity9 not only recognize the problem but want to meet to see what they can do about it			1
" the issue of security is vital in these countries and in @entity4 , " @entity51 said			0
it 's not just a threat for @entity4 , a recent report from the @entity26 military says			0
the violence in @entity7 and elsewhere south of the border could spill over to the @entity26 , says the report , issued in november by the @entity73			1
" the growing assault by the drug cartels and their thugs on the @entity7 government over the past several years reminds one that an unstable @entity7 could represent a homeland security problem of immense proportions to the @entity26 , " says the report , " @entity81 2008			1
" that instability could threaten the @entity26 ' underbelly along the 2,000 - mile border with @entity7			1
" any descent by @entity7 into chaos would demand an @entity26 response based on the serious implications for homeland security alone , " the report says			1
@entity7 secretary of governance @entity91 rejected that notion in an interview with @entity0 this week , saying it is " inadmissible " that the @entity26 would have to intervene			1
pastor , who was nominated by president @entity97 in 1994 to become @entity26 ambassador to @entity9 , believes the @entity26 should be more involved now			1

" we ought to have a clear recognition that that we are part of their problem , and they ca n't solve it without us , " he said			0
@entity9 foreign minister @entity114 indicated at a news conference this week that other nations also need to be more involved			0
he did n't mention the @entity26 but it was clear whom he was talking about			0
the summit leaders will ask nations that have high drug consumption to do their part to reduce that demand , the @entity120 news agency @entity119 quoted @entity126 as saying			0
@entity7 president @entity57 met with president - elect @entity127 in @entity42 this week and security was a prime subject of their discussions			2
" both countries share a long border , " said @entity132 , president of the @entity133			0
" they are terribly worried about the violence from organized crime in @entity7 and slipover into the @entity26 " @entity132 met with @entity57 at a private dinner hosted by the @entity7 president sunday night			1
after his meeting with @entity127 on monday , @entity57 stressed the level to which the two nations are intertwined when it comes to security			0
" the more secure @entity7 is , the more secure the @entity26 will be , " the @entity7 president said , first in @entity120 and then in @entity146 , to make sure no one missed the point			1
@entity127 is likely receptive to that message , said @entity150 , a vice president at the @entity133			0
" i think @entity127 is going to understand that @entity7 is very important to the @entity26 , " @entity150 told @entity0 last week			2
" this is n't an issue that he has focused a lot of attention on up until now			0
but he 's going to understand that if @entity7 really deteriorates or if the violence spills over into the border states , this is a war that he really has to deal with			2
" drug - fueled violence reached record levels in @entity7 last year , with around 5,400 slayings , more than double the 2,477 reported in 2007 , attorney general @entity159 said last month			1
the situation is so dire in @entity7 that the @entity73 report says , " in terms of worst - case scenarios for the @entity168 and indeed the world , two large and important states bear consideration for a rapid and sudden collapse : @entity172 and @entity7			2
" the report goes on to say that the " @entity7 possibility may seem less likely , but the government , its politicians , police , and judicial infrastructure are all under sustained assault and pressure by criminal gangs and drug cartels			2
how that internal conflict turns out over the next several years will have a major impact on the stability of the @entity7 state			0
