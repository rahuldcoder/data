-- changes to social studies curricula introduced by conservative members of the @entity4 were approved friday after months of ideologically driven debate			0
three separate votes on amended guidelines for elementary - , middle - and high - school curricula each resulted in 9 - 5 splits along party lines in favor of the new standards , known as @entity13			0
new standards for the high school economics course passed 14 - 0			0
debate over the guidelines has drawn scrutiny since conservative members of the board introduced the changes in 2009 in what they considered an effort to bring " balance " to the curriculum			1
" what we have is the history profession , the experts , seem to have a left - wing tilt , so what we were doing is trying to restore some balance to the standards , " board member @entity25 said in march			0
among the approved amendments , according to the @entity48 : discussions of the " solvency of long term entitlements , such as @entity52 and @entity53 " ; and an examination of why " the @entity34 protected religious freedom in @entity36 and guaranteed its free exercise by saying that @entity38 shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof , and compare and contrast this to the phrase ' separation of church and state			2
' " the board also voted " to add a direct reference to the election of president @entity58 " and to require students to become familiar with the political philosophies of @entity61			0
what is taught in @entity63 often is taught in other states because publishers typically tailor textbooks for @entity63 , one of the largest buyers of textbooks in the country			2
however , digital publishing has diminished the state 's influence on textbooks nationally and that curriculum is always going to be decided at the local level , education secretary @entity71 said			1
" whatever @entity63 decides , i do not think there will be large ripple effects around the country , " he said before friday 's votes			1
" textbook companies today have a real ability to customize textbooks and whatever the @entity63 board decides , i do n't think that 's going to impact education in other parts of the country			1
