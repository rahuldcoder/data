-- on monday , the world 's leading technology companies , including @entity3 and @entity4 , published an open letter to president @entity6 and @entity7 demanding reform of @entity10 privacy laws to restore the public 's " trust in the @entity13			1
" this comes after what seems like an endless series of revelations about government surveillance from the secret documents leaked by @entity20			0
let 's start with the latest : @entity10 and @entity23 spies have gone into online fantasy games to snoop on players , and to see if any militants are communicating with each other dressed as elves or gnomes			1
last week , the @entity30 reported that the @entity31 is " collecting billions of records a day to track the location of mobile phone users around the world			1
" and we learned recently that the @entity31 hacked fiber - optic cables and infected 50,000 networks with malware			0
@entity41 spying is happening at a scale we could never have imagined			1
this new awareness has prompted people -- even those with nothing to hide and who support broad surveillance for national security reasons -- to try to regain some control over their online privacy			1
according to a fall @entity55 report , 86 % of people " have taken steps online to remove or mask their digital footprints			2
" another study concluded that 64 % of internet users concerned about privacy have taken action to protect themselves in direct response to the @entity31 prism program			2
revelations of @entity31 spying even contributed to president @entity6 's approval rating sinking to a new low			1
@entity10 are very worried that they 've lost control of their personal data			2
in this atmosphere of anxiety and mistrust , people are adopting privacy solutions in unprecedented numbers			1
for example , @entity75 , a global encrypted communications company that provides secure phone and text solutions , has experienced explosive 400 % growth			2
my company , @entity80 , anonymized more than three million search queries in the first 30 days after launch			0
and sites like @entity85 are becoming popular destinations to learn about ways to protect your online privacy			2
it 's hard not to feel that we 've lost too much control when secret laws and new technologies empower governments and a handful of giant companies to secretly track , analyze and record virtually every detail about any of our lives ( even leaders of world superpowers )			1
without suspicion , it appears that untold millions of us have or will be subject to unconstitutional searches and seizures of our most personal information			0
no wonder many people believe that the @entity31 's actions violate our privacy			1
what 's even scarier is that government spy programs are rapidly expanding			2
for example , significant progress is being made to improve the use and capabilities of video surveillance			0
law enforcement agencies are partnering with technology firms to create video surveillance systems capable of facial recognition , scanning license plates and detecting radiation levels emitted by cars			0
in @entity125 , mayor @entity124 cited a joint @entity127 - @entity4 project and suggested that within five years there will be 24/7 video surveillance of the entire city			0
on @entity41 , @entity124 said , " get used to it ! " the government is also upgrading its ability to process and store the enormous amount of data it is acquiring			0
during the summer when @entity20 's disclosures were sending shock waves around the world , @entity10 taxpayers paid for a brand new $ 1.2 billion data farm that will serve as the @entity31 's external hard drive , designed specifically to improve " data acquisition , storage and processing effort			1
" meanwhile , consumer trust that companies can or will protect their personal information has been dealt a major blow as evidence emerged that the @entity31 collects information " at will " from @entity3 's and @entity153 's data hubs without those companies ' knowledge and that nine leading internet companies provided the government access directly to user information as part of the prism program			1
so it comes as no surprise that 58 % of people do n't trust @entity13 companies to protect privacy			1
tech leaders have even publicly acknowledged that news about @entity168 has hurt their brand trust to a far greater extent than any previous uproar over privacy violations			1
we ca n't assume any company can protect us from government snooping			0
so until existing laws change , we have to focus on controlling what we can			2
it 's possible that over time , consumers will increasingly avoid or limit sharing personal information			2
companies that collect huge silos of personal data may be viewed as unattractive -- as sources of intel the government can easily and secretly tap into			0
ironically , the companies known as the biggest online privacy offenders who 've created business models that rely on monetizing user data are now calling for limits on surveillance			1
@entity196 , really , what these companies seek has nothing to do with making their collection and use of our data more transparent			0
still , their point is well taken			0
the government must change surveillance laws to avoid destroying our trust and the current internet economy			0
those familiar with the entire cache of @entity20 's leaked documents insist that the most shocking and significant revelations are yet to come			0
and there 's a lot we 'll never know			0
according to the @entity10 government , @entity20 , a low - level contract engineer , had very limited access and no knowledge about the " crown jewels " of the @entity31 's surveillance program			0
what could those " crown jewels " be ? are n't you terrified to find out ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

the world 's leading tech companies asked president @entity6 to reform privacy laws
@entity227 : the scale of @entity235 spying is beyond our imagination
he says even those who have nothing to hide want to regain some control of their privacy
@entity227 : in this atmosphere of anxiety , more people are trying to find privacy solutions
