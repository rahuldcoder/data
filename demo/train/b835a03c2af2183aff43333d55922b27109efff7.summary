the family of a @entity2 convict executed for the deaths of his three daughters in a 1991 fire launched a new effort to clear his name wednesday by asking the state parole board for a posthumous pardon			1
@entity10 was put to death in 2004 for setting the fire that killed the girls : @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
but three expert reviews have concluded @entity10 's conviction was based on evidence of arson that was outdated , and his family has insisted on his innocence			1
" an error was made , and it is not too late to clear it up , " the family 's lawyers wrote in a petition filed with the state @entity27 in @entity28			2
@entity10 and his family " deserve more , " and " perhaps more importantly , the @entity2 deserves more			1
" junk science ? inmates fight to disprove arson the board denied clemency for @entity10 before his execution , dismissing the first of three reviews that questioned the arson finding at the heart of @entity10 's prosecution			2
two subsequent studies have reached the same conclusion , finding that most of the signs investigators looked for as proof the fire was deliberately set had been rendered obsolete by a series of studies in the 1990s			2
the last study was produced for the @entity51 , which began looking into the @entity10 case in 2008			2
a subsequent shakeup of the commission by @entity2 gov. @entity55 , who allowed @entity10 's execution to go forward , led to accusations that the governor was trying to derail the investigation			1
@entity55 has called @entity10 a " monster " whose conviction withstood every appeal			1
police and prosecutors in @entity65 , where the fire occurred , also stand by their case			2
@entity10 professed his innocence in his final statement , but his ex-wife has said he confessed to killing the girls before the execution			0
a jailhouse informant who testified in his trial has recanted his statement that @entity10 admitted to setting the fire , and a now - retired judge who sat on the state court that rejected @entity10 's appeal has written that the execution was " a miscarriage of justice " for which he was partly responsible , the family noted in its petition			1
the @entity51 's investigation effectively ended in 2011 , when a state attorney general 's opinion sharply restricted the panel 's jurisdiction			0
@entity90 said going to the pardons board -- whose members are @entity55 appointees -- was " one of the last resorts " the family has , but added , " this is about righting a wrong			1
" " this is n't about finger - pointing			0
it 's not about blaming anyone			0
it 's about giving a man his good name back , " he said			0
" he died with little else but his name , and we took that from him			0
" @entity107 , a spokesman for the pardons board , said the agency 's staff will review the petition , notifying trial officials and surviving victims and preparing a file for board members			0
applications typically take three to four months to process , he said			0
