after more than a week of stalemate , student leaders and the government have agreed to a framework for formal talks after protesters around the government headquarters gave civil servants better access to the building			1
talks are scheduled between the government and protest leaders at 4 p.m. local time friday ( 4 a.m. friday et ) , and media coverage will be allowed			1
the government 's number two official , chief secretary @entity15 , will be the principal negotiator from the government side			1
embattled chief executive @entity18 released a video statement saying students should consider the inconveniences to the general public and insisted the students clear the vehicle entrances to the government complex			0
he also advised students to leave the protest site in @entity27			0
the news of official talks comes as a dwindling number of pro-democracy demonstrators continue to cling on to their protest sites in key areas of the tightly packed city			1
as their numbers wane , so does patience of some of their fellow citizens			0
" at first , i supported them , but then i started to think they are being selfish because they block the roads -- and that 's wrong , " said @entity41 , who has sold newspapers from a stall in the busy district of @entity27 for 45 years			1
@entity41 says her business is down 30 % and getting worse			0
the student - led demonstrators are camped out at a major intersection in the neighborhood , which witnessed violent clashes between protesters and their opponents over the weekend			1
a @entity59 team at the main protest point in the @entity62 area also witnessed friction tuesday night as a handful of protesters wearing blue ribbons -- indicating an @entity68 stance -- were mobbed by hundreds of occupy student protesters			1
the protesters have blocked several main highways in the city for more than a week as they seek to change a decision by @entity75 's ruling @entity74 on how the next election for @entity78 's top leader will work			1
at their peak , the demonstrations brought tens of thousands of @entity78 residents together in spectacular fashion , covering large areas of the semiautonomous territory 's central business district in a sea of people			1
' disrupting my life ' but that was last week , when two back - to - back public holidays put work and classes on hold for a lot of people			0
as activity has cranked back up in the financial and commercial hub in recent days , crowds at the protest sites have thinned significantly and signs of discontent among other residents have spread			1
" i am very angry because this movement is disrupting my life , " said @entity104 , an elderly woman who has lived in @entity27 all her life			0
" i think there will be a rebellion actually , a rebellion of the other 7 million people in @entity78 against them			2
" the protests have blocked bus and tram routes , worsening traffic and putting more strain on the city 's rail network			0
some businesses , offices and schools have closed temporarily			0
in tuesday 's altercation in @entity62 , a known @entity124 activist , @entity123 , attempted to address crowds from street level through a megaphone and was surrounded by an angry crowd of hundreds of student protesters who began screaming to drown her out			1
she insisted that she was also from @entity78 and had a right to be heard , asking the crowds , " is this real democracy ? " the altercation , which involved verbal assault but no apparent physical abuse , lasted 10 to 15 minutes			2
eventually , half a dozen police came over and formed a ring around the handful of @entity68 protesters , who then left the area escorted by the officers			2
on sunday , a group of about 30 taxi drivers carried out their own protest to express their frustration with the pro-democracy sit - ins , which they said were affecting their livelihoods , according to local broadcaster @entity151			2
but the protest movement also commands a lot of sympathy among residents of the city , especially after police used tear gas and pepper spray in a failed effort to disperse demonstrators on september 28 -- tactics seen by many as overly harsh			2
is it safe to travel to @entity78 ? is it ' deal time ' ? some commentators are arguing that now is a good moment for demonstrators to cash in their chips before they lose too much support			1
" the longer this drags on , the more student activists risk looking to average @entity78 like irritants , " wrote @entity172 , an @entity173 columnist for @entity174 , suggesting it 's now " deal time for @entity78 's students			1
" " why not parlay what 's been achieved so far into meaningful concessions from the government ? " @entity172 said			0
his suggestion follows calls from some prominent figures , including the heads of local universities , for students to leave the protest sites for their own safety			1
other observers have noted that the demonstrators have succeeded in putting the democracy issue back on the agenda			0
but it remains uncertain what kind of deal the protesters might be able to reach with the government			0
one of the movement 's demands has been the resignation of @entity78 's top leader , chief executive @entity18			1
increasing fatigue some demonstrators have said they are running out of steam after enduring long days and nights camped out on the asphalt amid stifling heat and torrential downpours			0
" i 'm tired , but i think we have to stay a while longer , " said @entity212 , a student who has been at the main protest site on @entity214 for a week			2
are you there ? share images , if you can safely ' we really have to stand strong ' other protesters among the depleted crowd still holding firm at the site tuesday expressed similar determination to stay put until some kind of result was achieved			0
" we really have to stand strong , " said @entity228 , a student who had been protesting for eight days			0
" there 's been a lot of rumors about clearing out , but i feel if we stay here , we still have a bit of bargaining power			0
" student leaders have said they will continue the protest until they have productive talks with the government and expressed optimism that their supporters will stick with them			1
" many protesters need rest after nine days of occupation , " @entity242 , the deputy secretary general of the @entity243 , said monday			2
" i do n't believe they are already giving up			0
when they have recovered , they will return			0
" but the government appears content to watch the demonstrators ' numbers dwindle as negotiations drag on .			2
