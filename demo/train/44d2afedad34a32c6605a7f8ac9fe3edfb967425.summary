@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the halls of the @entity6 practice facility , players can be seen carrying @entity7 everywhere they go			1
they 're not goofing off or taking a break , it 's part of their weekly football practice			2
the @entity6 are one of two @entity13 teams , along with the @entity14 , that have purchased @entity7 for their players and coaches to use instead of the standard playbook			1
baseball and hockey leagues have also taken notice of the advantages of mobile technology			1
@entity6 players no longer need to haul paper - filled binders and stacks of dvds from practice to home in order to continually prepare for game day			1
while there are still @entity13 restrictions on how computer tablets can be used , these devices are slowly starting to change the way professional teams operate , offering high - quality video and internet connectivity almost anywhere			1
just before this season , the @entity6 moved the team 's playbook , a huge three - ring binder , into a custom app on the tablet			2
it plays @entity13 films used to study upcoming opponents , says general manager @entity49			2
" it was a smashing success for our players			2
they loved it , " he said			0
the team printed paper playbooks as a backup this year , but @entity49 says next year , " we 're going green " -- no paper playbooks			0
the @entity6 first developed a customized application on the @entity7 as a draft tool to allow coaches to watch college games while evaluating players involved in the draft , said head coach @entity66			1
" i was able to watch college players on the @entity7 while in the car or in the hotel , " @entity66 said			1
after the success of the draft tool app , the @entity6 ' owners approved the purchase of 150 @entity7 and 90 were handed out to players and coaches			1
they were loaded with the @entity6 ' newly updated custom application			2
" everyone loves this , man			0
it 's very helpful , " said @entity6 defensive tackle @entity80			2
but do n't expect to see the tablets on the sidelines of games , in locker rooms or in the coaches ' booth			0
@entity13 rules prohibit the use of any electronic computers , tablets or recording devices within 90 minutes of kickoff			1
" polaroid - type cameras " are the only device allowed to be used during a game , according to @entity13 rules			1
the cameras capture high angle still images of the field , which are printed on paper near the players ' benches on the field , giving the teams a different view of what their opponents are doing on the field			2
@entity13 spokesman @entity110 says the league is " strategically holding back " on technology advancements			1
" we try to keep as much of the human element in the game , " he said			0
in addition , he said , the @entity13 's strategy is to keep competition fair among all the teams			1
even if the @entity13 allowed computer tablets on the sidelines , it 's unlikely that @entity124 's @entity7 would be used , because the league 's major sponsor @entity125 has a tablet , the @entity127			1
@entity125 tablets not selling with 11 million @entity7 recently sold , according to @entity124 's financial report , app developers are scrambling to get the attention of young professional athletes who are accustomed to @entity124 products			1
one of those developers , @entity134 , decided to give @entity7 to professional baseball players so they could review its newly developed app , " @entity138 , " created exclusively for professional baseball players			1
" we did n't have to , " said @entity140 with @entity134			0
" because every player had an @entity7			2
" the front office management of 19 out of 30 baseball clubs have adopted apps like @entity138 , which features statistics , averages and video clips that can be customized			0
the @entity149 is also utilizing mobile technology , allowing its live games to be broadcast through paid subscriptions to @entity153 on mobile devices including tablets			1
but not everyone in professional sports has immediately embraced the technology			2
" our dinosaurs have been our coaches , " said @entity49			0
" ( they ) are older and used to the more traditional way of doing things			0
" the @entity6 ' linebacker coach , @entity165 , admitted he was " a little skeptical " when the team started using @entity7			1
his concerns were rooted in a past experience , when another team he worked for started using laptops			0
at the time , he said , it was a poor integration of technology and the team 's needs			0
today , he admits things have changed			0
" to have all that information at your fingertips accessible and convenient , " said @entity165			0
" it 's a godsend			0
" @entity165 and the other coaches said they believe the @entity7 have helped improved their players ' study habits			1
@entity66 points out that the players ' motivation was already there , the technology has just helped them capitalize on it			2
" at the end of the day these guys want to be great , so they want to study their opponents , " said @entity66			0
" so they have the ability to be ( great ) and that 's the desire that makes them watch it			0
" bucs linebacker @entity195 says the easy access to watching plays has created a kind of addiction			0
" i use it on a daily basis , sometimes my girlfriend gets mad at me because i 'm so into it , " @entity195 said			0
" i 'm watching films all day			0
