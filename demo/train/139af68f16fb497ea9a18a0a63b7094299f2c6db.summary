@entity0 -- a defunct satellite plummeting toward @entity4 is expected to re-enter the atmosphere between 11:45 p.m. friday and 12:45 a.m. saturday et , @entity2 reported late friday evening			1
" during that time period , the satellite will be passing over @entity8 and @entity9 , as well as vast areas of the @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity14 oceans			2
the risk to public safety is very remote , " the space agency said			1
the @entity18 is once again an unlikely but potential target for the 26 pieces of the @entity21 , expected to survive the descent			1
those pieces , made of stainless steel , titanium and beryllium that wo n't burn , will range from about 10 pounds to hundreds of pounds , according to @entity2			1
" there is a low probability any debris that survives re-entry will land in the @entity18 , " @entity2 headquarters said , " but the possibility can not be discounted because of this changing rate of descent			1
" @entity35 of @entity2 's @entity37 team in @entity38 said there 's no way to know exactly where the pieces will come down			1
" keep in mind , they wo n't be traveling at those high orbital velocities			2
as they hit the air , they tend to slow down			0
... they 're still traveling fast , a few tens to hundreds of miles per hour , but no longer those tremendous orbital velocities , " he explained			2
because the satellite travels thousands of miles in a matter of minutes as it orbits -- even just before it begins re-entry -- it will be impossible to pinpoint the exact location the pieces will come down			1
on top of that , @entity35 said , the satellite is not stable			2
" part of the problem is , the spacecraft is tumbling in unpredictable ways , and it is very difficult to very precisely pinpoint where it 's coming down even right before the re-entry			2
" because water covers 70 % of the @entity4 's surface , @entity2 has said that most if not all of the surviving debris will land in water			1
even if pieces strike dry land , there 's very little risk any of it will hit people			1
however , in an abundance of caution , the @entity79 released an advisory thursday warning pilots about the falling satellite , calling it a potential hazard			0
" it is critical that all pilots / flight crew members report any observed falling space debris to the appropriate ( air traffic control ) facility and include position , altitude , time and direction of debris observed , " the @entity79 statement said			0
the @entity79 said warnings of this sort typically are sent out to pilots concerning specific hazards they may encounter during flights such as air shows , rocket launches , kites and inoperable radio navigational aids			0
@entity2 says space debris the size of the satellite 's components re-enters the atmosphere about once a year			1
@entity111 astrophysicist @entity110 noted that the satellite is far from being the biggest space junk to come back			2
" this is nothing like the old @entity116 scare of the ' 70s , when you had a 70 - ton space station crashing out of the sky			0
so , i agree with the folks in @entity38			0
it 's nothing to be worried about , " @entity110 said			0
pieces of @entity116 came down in western @entity124 in 1979			0
the only wild card @entity110 sees is if somehow a chunk hits a populated area			0
" if the thing happens to come down in a city , that would be bad			0
the chances of it causing extensive damage or injuring someone are much higher			0
" @entity2 said that once the debris hits the atmosphere 50 miles up , it will take only a matter of minutes before the surviving pieces hit the @entity4			1
@entity1 's @entity139 contributed to this report .			0

re-entry is expected between 11:45 p.m. friday and 12:45 a.m. saturday et , @entity2 says
the space agency still ca n't say with *certainty* where the satellite 's remnants will land
about 26 pieces , some weighing hundreds of pounds , are expected to survive *reentry*
