@entity1 economic council director @entity0 pointed fingers at @entity3 on thursday for not acting fast enough on cybersecurity legislation , in the wake of news that @entity7 was behind the @entity9 cyberattack			1
" we 're doing what we can within the executive authorities of the president to do what we can across the federal government -- both protect the federal government assets and to work with the private sector -- but in order to take this to the next level we need legislation , " he said at a @entity11 breakfast			1
the @entity9 hack attack has breathed new life into controversial legislation often called the " zombie bill " by opponents because of its failure to launch			1
the proposed cybersecurity bill is intended to help companies and the government work together to thwart hackers through increased data sharing			1
@entity37 chairman @entity36 , @entity38 , said the november attack has increased urgency for the @entity41 , which failed to make it to the @entity37 floor in july , despite winning bipartisan committee support			0
@entity36 , who remains the committee 's top @entity45 when the new @entity48 majority takes control in january , plans to reintroduce the measure			1
" we must pass an information sharing bill as quickly as possible next year , " she said in a statement this week			0
privacy advocates have opposed the legislation -- and it 's @entity1 companion -- at every turn , since it was first introduced in 2012			1
they argue the bill 's broad language could breach the public 's privacy and civil liberties			2
" @entity66 advocates will be there to steadfastly oppose any privacy and invasive information sharing bills , " said @entity63 , a legislative analyst at @entity64			2
every time there is a massive public security breach , the legislation gets a new lease on life , he said , but added there are already measures in place that foster information sharing between the private sector and the government			2
a recent executive order issued by president @entity82 created a program that allows companies to voluntarily share information with the @entity85			0
once a threat is deemed critical , the information would be disseminated with member companies			0
but @entity63 admits the government has n't done a good enough job at luring companies to join the network			0
although the proposed cybersecurity bills are also voluntary for companies to participate , language has been written into the bill that shields businesses from " frivolous lawsuits " and " unnecessary bureaucratic obstacles , " according to sen. @entity97 , of @entity98 , the top - ranking @entity48 on the @entity37 , and co-author of the @entity37 measure			0
but privacy and civil liberties groups fear the expansive immunity for corporations will discourage companies from protecting their user 's data .			0

the @entity1 hopes to build support for cybersecurity legislation in the wake of the @entity9 hack
*lawmakers* will *revisit* the measure when they *reconvene* in january
