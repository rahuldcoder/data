@entity0 -- school teachers should be held accountable for the performance of their students , the @entity2 said tuesday , according to the group 's leader			1
" the @entity2 unanimously supports student growth over time as a measurement in teachers , " said @entity0 mayor @entity8 , who presides over the conference as president			1
" that should be at least one of the elements of their evaluation , and if you ask mayors across the country , they will agree			2
" the 59 - year - old @entity21 told reporters that the issues in @entity24 and @entity0 , the largest and second - largest public school districts in the nation , are similar to those in @entity28 , the third - largest , where thousands of teachers have been on strike since monday			1
" these are n't radical notions , and my hope is the parties will sit down and figure it out			0
the public wants to see more accountability , " he said			1
@entity28 teachers strike into its third day the @entity40 has been reviewing a system of teacher and administrator evaluations that , for the first time , includes student test scores , said spokeswoman @entity46			1
several @entity48 unions have objected to the @entity50 administration 's $ 4.3 - billion @entity52 program , which offers federal grants to help states improve failing schools but requires that teacher evaluations factor in student test scores			2
the 325,000 - member @entity58 recently supported a @entity48 bill that would have included evaluations of teacher performance , but the measure was pulled after 11th - hour attempts to move it forward failed in the legislature			0
in response to the @entity50 administration 's initiative , @entity58 spokesman @entity67 said , " we agree , as long as multiple measures are used beyond just test scores , and the right remains for using test scores to be negotiated locally to meet local student needs			0
" @entity77 , a union that represents 45,000 public school teachers and health and human services professionals , has been engaged in a legal battle with the @entity40 involving the use of standardized test scores in contract negotiations			1
@entity28 strike could influence teacher accountability debate such practices have been shown to be " very unreliable and often inaccurate at the individual teacher level because there are many home and school influences on learning other than an individual teacher that can not be addressed , " according to a study released by the @entity90			1
" teachers who have many new immigrant students also suffer low ratings when their students are tested before they have had a chance to learn @entity102 , " it added			0
@entity77 president @entity103 said his union has developed a plan that uses trained evaluators to assess the performance of teachers			0
" the plan incorporates data on student outcomes to identify areas of student need and to improve instruction , but test scores are not used for punitive measures , " he said in a statement			0
while @entity8 has no jurisdiction over the @entity40 , he has focused on changing the education process			2
" we 've got to engage in the reforms to get more success in our schools , to increase the graduation rate and make sure that more of our kids can read and write when they graduate , " he said			0
teachers : why do you teach ?			0
