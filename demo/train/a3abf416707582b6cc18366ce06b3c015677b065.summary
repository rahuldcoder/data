-- the man destined to become leader of the world 's most populous nation will sit in the halls of power in @entity7 , but a part of him remains in the @entity10 heartland			2
@entity12 's visit to the @entity10 last february included expected stops in @entity14 and trade meetings in @entity16			1
but the part @entity12 , 59 , looked most forward to was an evening in @entity20 , @entity21			1
he wanted to visit " old friends " he 'd met on a trip to @entity21 almost 30 years ago			1
rewind to a time when @entity26 was ascending to the leadership of the @entity28 , @entity24 was taken hostage in @entity30 and @entity31 was just another place in @entity7			0
@entity12 arrived in @entity20 for two weeks in april 1985 with a @entity34 delegation looking into farming technology			1
the next leader of the powerful communist state -- he is expected to take the helm early next year -- got a first - hand look at how @entity10 capitalists do agriculture			1
@entity42 , president of @entity43 , recalled how @entity12 discussed globalization , its scope then unimaginable to many @entity10			1
as major @entity34 leadership change begins , questions swirl @entity42 marveled at today 's global economy			0
his own company now exports food and pet products to @entity34			0
back then , he escorted @entity12 on a tour of a corn processing plant			2
at times , the language barrier was hard to overcome			0
how do you translate words such as centrifuge ? @entity42 gestured heavily and drew drawings in the sand to explain things to his @entity34 visitor			0
he kept a tin of black tea that @entity12 presented to him as a memento of the visit			2
after all these years , the tin is preserved half full			0
@entity42 was one of 14 people invited to a private dinner with @entity12 at the circa 1866 @entity71 home of @entity72 in february			0
they had all met @entity12 on his first trip			2
then , @entity12 had dined on @entity21 beef and corn			1
@entity72 decided to go up a notch on elegance for @entity34 's next leader			0
her menu boasted tenderloin , spring rolls and bacon - wrapped scallops			0
" you were the first group of @entity10 i came into contact with , " @entity12 told his @entity21 friends			1
" to me , you are @entity10			0
" @entity12 's visit was a big deal for @entity20 , a small eastern @entity21 town known for farming , the largest @entity90 plant outside of @entity91 and factories that used to spit out billions of mother - of - pearl buttons			1
that was before the refinement of plastic			0
as @entity21 gov. @entity97 put it : this is the biggest thing to hit @entity20 since @entity101 's visit in 1979			1
@entity97 , who also met @entity12 in 1985 , was invited to the dinner hosted by @entity72			2
" we consider you a great friend of @entity21 , " @entity97 told @entity12 , according to @entity103			1
" we are so appreciative you chose to come to @entity20 and to @entity21			1
" @entity12 also visited a farm near @entity108 , @entity21 , in february , and while in the state , he and other @entity34 officials signed a five - year cooperation deal with @entity14 on food security , food safety and sustainable agriculture			1
three challenges for @entity34 's next leaders @entity117 , the @entity103 's former editor , told @entity0 that he had received thousands of e-mails from journalists around the world who were curious about @entity12 's visit			2
" it 's obviously a pretty big deal , " @entity117 said			0
" you never know what will come as a result of this kitchen - table diplomacy			0
" that kind of one - on - one relationship made an impression on @entity12 on his first trip to @entity21			1
" when you get the opportunity to meet somebody in their home or in a private setting , you get to know them differently than at a state dinner , " @entity117 said			0
" clearly that worked on mr. @entity12 when he was here 27 years ago			0
" now , as @entity34 's ruling @entity28 convenes its 18th @entity140 , the world wonders what course the global power will chart under new leadership			0
what will the future bring for @entity10 's relationship with the @entity149 giant ? in @entity21 , some people know this : that sometimes , it pays to sit on a couch , in front of a blazing fire and build a bridge to friendship			1
and that even after @entity12 assumes @entity34 's top post , he will keep @entity20 close to his heart .			2

@entity12 visited @entity21 in 1985 and returned earlier this year to @entity20 to visit " old friends "
on his first trip to @entity21 , @entity12 learned about agriculture techniques from farmers
he considers his @entity21 friends the best of @entity10
