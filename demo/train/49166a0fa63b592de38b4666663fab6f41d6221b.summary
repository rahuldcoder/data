-- according to documents leaked to @entity4 , @entity2 representatives are being given a strong company line to deliver to unhappy @entity7 owners who complain about reception issues			1
employees are told to say that the device 's reception performance " is the best we have ever shipped " and that its critical antenna flaws are " a fact of life in the wireless world			1
" they are told not to perform service on @entity18 with these problems and instead to give customers a pr - driven recitative instead			1
these statements are dead ringers for ceo @entity25 ' own assertions that the @entity7 antenna and reception issues do not , in fact , exist			2
" there is no reception issue , " he told one user			1
but the very fact that this document exists suggests that @entity36 execs know there is indeed a widespread hardware flaw , even if they 're unwilling to address it publicly at this time			1
after users complained about @entity7 reception problems , @entity36 released a written statement last week saying , " gripping any mobile phone will result in some attenuation of its antenna performance , with certain places being worse than others depending on the placement of the antennas			1
" an @entity36 spokesperson said monday the company would have no further statements on the subject			1
@entity36 did not immediately respond thursday to an e-mail seeking comment on the leaked documents			1
outside the reality distortion field , on the other hand , @entity0 and many other sites have been able to duplicate the issue being discussed : when held by its sides , which are composed of a metal antenna band , the phone 's reception quality drops dramatically			1
@entity7 owners in our newsroom have seen reception decrease from five to two bars simply from holding the phone with two points of contact between the owner 's hand and the antenna band			2
one law firm is even preparing for a class - action lawsuit against @entity36 and is soliciting @entity7 4 customers to contact them about reception issues			1
also , while some folks have reported that using a bumper case prevents contact with the antenna band and preserves reception quality , @entity2 reps are being told to not give bumper cases to disgruntled users			1
here 's the full text of the document as reported : 1			2
keep all of the positioning statements in the @entity90 handy -- your tone when delivering this information is important			0
a. the @entity7 's wireless performance is the best we have ever shipped			2
our testing shows that @entity7 's overall antenna performance is better than @entity98			2
b. gripping almost any mobile phone in certain places will reduce its reception			0
this is true of the @entity7 , the @entity98 , and many other phones we have tested			0
it is a fact of life in the wireless world			0
c. if you are experiencing this on your @entity98 , avoid covering the bottom - right side with your hand			0
d. if you are experiencing this on your @entity7 , avoid covering the black strip in the lower - left corner of the metal band			0
e. the use of a case or @entity119 that is made out of rubber or plastic may improve wireless performance by keeping your hand from directly covering these areas			0
do not perform warranty service			2
use the positioning above for any customer questions or concerns			0
do n't forget you still need to probe and troubleshoot			0
if a customer calls about their reception while the phone is sitting on a table ( not being held ) it is not the metal band			0
only escalate if the issue exists when the phone is not held and you can not resolve it			0
we are not appeasing customers with free bumpers -- do n't promise a free bumper to customers			0

@entity2 reps are told not to perform service on @entity148 with reception problems
they are *instructed* to instead give customers a @entity154 - driven recitative
the document 's existence suggests @entity36 knows there is a widespread hardware flaw
one law firm is seeking clients for a possible class - action lawsuit against @entity36
