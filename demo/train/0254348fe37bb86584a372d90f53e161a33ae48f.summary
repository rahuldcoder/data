@entity0 , @entity1 -- a demonstrator died and several @entity5 service members and @entity1 police were injured as protests over the burning of @entity9 at a @entity5 military base turned violent sunday , said officials			1
the bloodshed in northern @entity13 came a day after a gunman killed two @entity5 military officers inside their office in the highly secured @entity1 @entity17 -- one of several incidents targeting allied forces after reports emerged last week that @entity22 troops had burned @entity24 holy books at @entity25			1
@entity5 officials , including president @entity27 , have apologized for the burning and called it inadvertent			1
a military official -- speaking on condition of anonymity , given the sensitivity of the issue -- said the materials were from a detainee center 's library and had " inscriptions " that appeared to be used to " facilitate extremist communications			0
" such statements , or explanations , have n't stopped protests from @entity24 in @entity1 , who believe the @entity44 is the word of @entity45 and so holy that people should wash their hands before even touching it			2
on sunday , the sixth day of protests , initially peaceful demonstrators in @entity13 attacked a police chief 's office and a @entity5 military base , @entity13 police spokesman @entity50 said			1
some threw hand grenades at the base , known as @entity60 , with resulting blasts injuring seven @entity5 personnel believed to be @entity64 members , said @entity50			1
capt. @entity65 , a spokesman with @entity22 's @entity66 , said there was an explosion and small arms fire			1
@entity66 did not comment on the number or positions of those hurt , though @entity65 did say those hurt were evacuated for medical care			0
one protester was killed and three wounded in the violence at the military site , according to @entity50			2
another 16 protesters suffered injuries as grenades , pistols , knives , sticks and stones were used to attack the police chief 's office in @entity13 , said @entity50 , the police spokesman			2
@entity5 secretary of state @entity89 told @entity2 on sunday that such unrest and targeting of @entity5 has gotten " out of hand and needs to stop			1
" she urged @entity1 to abide by the call of their president , @entity93 , for calm			0
in a televised address , @entity93 said the " emotions of our people " over the burned qurans " are legitimate and valuable			0
" still , he added that staying calm will help stop " enemies of our peace and stability " from taking advantage and harming people and property			0
@entity5 ambassador to @entity1 , @entity109 , acknowledged " some tough attacks up north " in a @entity2 interview sunday , while adding that the " rest of the country ... was pretty calm today			1
" " ( such anger generally ) tapers off , and i think we 're all hopeful that the appeal for calm that president @entity93 made today -- and he did so with the backing of the entire political leadership of the country -- will create a condition in which this diminishes , " said @entity109			0
at least 29 people have been killed and nearly 200 wounded in recent protests , @entity93 said			1
the death of the demonstrator in @entity13 would appear to raise that death toll to 30			0
they have n't been the only ones killed in the wake of the @entity44 burnings			0
two @entity5 soldiers were gunned down last week at a base in eastern @entity1 by a man wearing an @entity136 uniform			1
and then , on saturday , a man went to the @entity1 interior ministry , signed himself in and then retrieved his gun , according to an @entity1 counter-terrorism official who spoke on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk with the media about the incident			2
@entity66 said that initial reports indicated " an individual " -- whom they did not name -- shot dead two @entity22 service members , later confirmed by an @entity1 police official to be an @entity5 colonel and major			1
the @entity151 on sunday identified one of the officers killed as @entity5 air force lt. col. @entity154 , 44 , of @entity155 , @entity156			1
the @entity1 official identified the suspected gunman as @entity159 , a junior officer in the ministry 's intelligence department who the official claimed had spent two months in a @entity165 religious school			2
" we believe it was 100 % linked to the @entity44 burning because of the religious background of this junior officer , " the counter-terrorism official said			0
the @entity171 claimed responsibility for the shooting , with its spokesman identifying the shooter by the same first name , @entity177 , that the @entity1 official used			1
the @entity1 official did not say , though , if it was known the gunman was a member of the @entity171			0
the @entity1 interior ministry confirmed the gunman is thought to be one of its employees and that his " whereabouts are unknown			2
" senior @entity1 officials , including the defense and interior ministers , have postponed a scheduled trip to @entity189 to meet @entity5 defense secretary @entity190 and others , @entity151 press secretary @entity184 said			1
" ( the officials ) are consulting this week with others in the @entity1 government and @entity1 religious leaders on how to protect @entity66 personnel and quell violence in the country , " said @entity184			2
saturday 's killing prompted gen. @entity199 -- the commander of @entity66 -- to order the withdrawal of several hundred @entity66 advisers from ministries in @entity0 as a precaution			0
such a move raises questions about a @entity5 military plan focusing on the use of small teams of military advisers as it withdraws troops			0
yet lt. col. @entity211 , an @entity66 spokesman , stressed the advisers are still in contact with @entity1 personnel			2
" we will not let this incident divide the coalition , " @entity211 said			0
the @entity5 also pulled embedded civilians out of ministries , said @entity109			1
and @entity220 announced sunday that it was withdrawing all @entity220 public officials in @entity1 institutions temporarily to ensure their safety			1
amid the protests , @entity66 said sunday that its efforts against the @entity171 continue to move forward			0
in fact , @entity1 and coalition security forces captured @entity171 leaders in the provinces of @entity231 and @entity232 , @entity66 announced sunday			2
so too was a commander with the insurgent @entity234 , in his case in @entity237			0
@entity109 highlighted the progress that 's been made in @entity1 since the @entity5 embassy opened more than a decade ago with " nothing -- no institutions , no ministries , no police , no army			1
" still , he stressed that the stakes remain high in calling for a continued commitment to the country			0
" if we decide we 're tired of it , @entity248 and the @entity171 certainly are n't , " said @entity109			0
@entity2 's @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 contributed to this report .			0
