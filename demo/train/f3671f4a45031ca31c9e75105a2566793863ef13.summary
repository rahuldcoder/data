@entity0 -- a top @entity3 leader agreed thursday with president @entity4 and @entity5 that extending the payroll tax cut would help the economy , but the parties remained divided over how to pay for the move			1
later thursday , the @entity10 blocked competing @entity5 and @entity3 proposals from moving forward , setting up negotiations on a possible compromise			1
the @entity5 plan to extend and expand the payroll tax cut set to expire at the end of the year would assess a 3.25 % tax on income over $ 1 million to pay the cost of more than $ 200 billion for the extension			1
taxpayers with an income of $ 50,000 would benefit by $ 1,500 a year			0
@entity10 @entity3 prevented democrats from getting the 60 votes needed to proceed on the measure , which was blocked on a 51 - 49 vote			2
president @entity4 quickly blamed @entity3 , saying in a statement that they " chose to raise taxes on nearly 160 million hardworking @entity29 because they refused to ask a few hundred thousand millionaires and billionaires to pay their fair share			1
" " it makes absolutely no sense to raise taxes on the middle class at a time when so many are still trying to get back on their feet , " @entity4 said , adding he would " continue to urge @entity41 to stop playing politics with the security of millions of @entity29 families and small business owners and get this done			1
" a @entity3 alternative that would freeze discretionary government spending and cut federal jobs , while also raising @entity51 costs for @entity29 with incomes above $ 750,000 a year , also got blocked by opposition from both parties on a 20 - 78 vote			2
despite the outcome of the votes , a softening of @entity3 opposition to extending the lower payroll tax rate raised expectations for eventual congressional passage of a compromise plan			1
@entity65 @entity3 leaders are working on their own proposal to extend unemployment benefits and the payroll tax cut , but several @entity3 aides told @entity1 it was unclear if these extensions would be rolled into one bill or end up as separate legislative proposals			1
@entity3 leaders planned a closed - door meeting friday morning to discuss options with rank - and - file members on how to pay for the extensions			2
house speaker @entity79 , @entity80 , signaled his support for an eventual deal thursday by telling reporters : " i do n't think there 's any question that the payroll tax relief , in fact , helps the economy			1
" his stance represented a sharp shift from previous opposition by @entity92 to extending the payroll tax cut			1
on sunday , conservative sen. @entity94 , @entity95 , said @entity3 opposed extending the lower payroll tax rate because it did n't provide much help to the economy			1
" the payroll tax holiday has not stimulated job creation , " @entity94 said on " @entity99			2
" " we do n't think that is a good way to do it			0
" the @entity3 opposition wavered wednesday when @entity10 @entity3 leader @entity106 of @entity107 said his party would support an extension of the payroll tax cut , but opposed a tax increase to pay for it			1
" republicans will put aside their misgivings and support this extension , not because we believe , as the president does , that another short - term stimulus will turn this economy around ... but because we know it will give some relief to struggling workers out there who continue to need it nearly three years into this presidency , " @entity112 said on the @entity10 floor			1
a tax on wealthy @entity29 to pay for the plan would punish " the private sector businesses that the @entity29 people are counting on to help turn this economy around , " @entity112 said			0
the @entity65 and @entity5 have pushed back hard against the @entity3 argument			2
@entity132 , the new chairman of the @entity133 , told reporters this week that the proposed surtax on incomes above $ 1 million " would hit very few small businesses			0
" " the vast majority -- one figure i saw was 99 % of individuals with small business income -- would not be affected by this , " @entity132 said			0
@entity65 press secretary @entity143 said thursday that the question is whether " it is worth giving 160 million @entity29 , taxpayers , a tax break of $ 1,500 by asking 300,000 @entity29 to pay a little more			0
" both @entity143 and @entity5 sen. @entity147 of @entity148 noted that the issue is turning in their favor , with @entity3 opposition to the @entity5 plan softening			2
" this would 've been unheard of even six months ago , " @entity147 said of a possible break from the @entity3 anti-tax orthodoxy			0
" but we 're changing the debate and the public is with us			0
" however , two @entity5 senators -- @entity161 of @entity162 and @entity163 of @entity164 -- and independent sen. @entity165 of @entity166 , who caucuses with the @entity5 , opposed the party 's proposal			0
the measure would have failed even if all three supported it , due to the near - unanimous @entity3 opposition			0
only moderate @entity3 sen. @entity173 of @entity174 sided with @entity5 in backing the proposal			0
@entity79 's comments showed that both parties now publicly acknowledge the benefits of the payroll tax cut			1
according to the non-partisan @entity181 , 121 million families have benefited from the payroll tax break , with an increase in take - home pay of $ 934 for the average worker			2
@entity186 estimated in august that letting the tax cut expire would reduce growth by as much as 0.5 %			0
it called extending the cut one of the " most straightforward " ways to " reduce some of the coming fiscal restraint			0
" @entity4 challenged @entity3 on wednesday to " fight as hard for middle - class families as you do for those who are more fortunate , " a dig at the @entity3 refusal to consider the longstanding @entity5 push for higher taxes on the wealthiest @entity29			1
speaking at a high school in @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity4 evoked a loud cheer when he said the @entity5 proposal to extend and expand the reduced payroll tax rate " is paid for by asking our wealthiest citizens to pay their fair share			1
" the @entity5 bill blocked in the @entity10 would extend and expand last year 's tax break			2
payroll taxes , cut to 4.2 % from 6.2 % last year , would be lowered to 3.1 % to provide middle - class families with up to $ 1,500 more in their paychecks next year			1
the measure also would partially extend the break to employers , hoping that might spur hiring			0
the price tag of the bill is about $ 265 billion , which would be paid for by the 3.25 % surtax on annual income above $ 1 million , according to @entity5 aides			0
meanwhile , the @entity10 @entity3 plan that also was blocked would continue the 4.2 % payroll tax rate for a year and pay for it by imposing a three - year freeze on federal salaries and reducing the federal work force by 10 % through replacing workers when they quit or retire			1
in addition , the plan would require @entity29 earning $ 750,000 a year or more to pay higher premiums for @entity51 , and prevent millionaires from getting food stamps or unemployment compensation			0
according to a @entity3 aide , the nonpartisan @entity236 found that the @entity51 , food stamp and unemployment provisions would save $ 9 billion over 10 years , mostly from @entity51			0
@entity1 's @entity240 , @entity241 and @entity242 contributed to this report .			0
