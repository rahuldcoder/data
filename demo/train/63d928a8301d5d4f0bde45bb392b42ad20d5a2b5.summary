-- to the outside world , the crisis in @entity2 seemed to come out of nowhere			1
cast your mind back to the days before everything changed			0
before the revolution ; before the downing of @entity9 ; before the @entity11 tanks rolled into @entity12			0
who could have possibly foretold how events would unravel ? but for a group of @entity2 artists , the violence of 2014 was no surprise			1
they had been warning of the impending unrest for years -- through the medium of visual art. " it really is uncanny , " says @entity23 , the ceo of the @entity24 in @entity25 , which is hosting a new exhibition of @entity2 artworks			1
" if you look at the art created in the years before the crisis , it is hard not to come to the conclusion that these artists had a sort of weird foresight			1
it 's as if they had a crystal ball			0
" predicting the future the exhibition , titled @entity42 : @entity43 now , is the biggest of its kind in the world , and will run until 3 november			1
some of the artworks will make the hair on the back of the neck of even the most cynical observer stand on end			2
@entity53 's 2012 painting , " beach , " shows people relaxing by the sea -- while behind them a paratrooper is landing in the surf			0
a series of photographs called " @entity62 " by the artist known as @entity61 , which was created in 2005 , envisages the burnt - out shell of the national museum in @entity65			2
only the @entity66 is left ; the rest of the building is a charred , overgrown ruin			0
a spine - chilling 2012 painting by @entity72 depicts a crowd of protesters with pitchforks , running side - by - side with skeletons			2
it is titled " @entity79			0
" last but not least , @entity81 's 1996 painting envisages a scenario that is eerily similar to the events of 2014 , with a group of people watching an explosion			2
its name ? " invasion "			2
prophetic images other artworks seem to prognosticate the unrest in a more metaphorical way , conveying a palpable sense of unease , concern about the fragility of the country , and fear for the future			1
the centerpiece of @entity101 's series of photographs called " @entity2 " , for example , is a picture of a foreboding , dark cloud hanging over the landscape			1
it was created in 2013 , a year before the unrest			0
@entity114 's " @entity113 , " painted in 2007 , depicts one teenager stoning another while a gang of onlookers cheers him on			0
and @entity116 's installation " untitled , " from 2012 , is comprised of a fractured section of road with smoke seeping ominously through the cracks			0
@entity121 for @entity2 yet despite these macabre images , @entity23 says that the exhibition is underpinned by optimism			1
" a good number of the works are uplifting , using bright colors and witty references to @entity130 pop culture and @entity132 iconography , " he says			0
" overall , the exhibition teaches us a lot about warmth , openness , and resilience of the @entity2 people , and expresses a huge hope and aspiration for their country			1
" it can only be hoped that the artists are as justified in their optimism as they were in their fears			0
the extraordinary art of autistic ' five - year - old @entity149 ' eye - popping street art and how it broke free of the banks the moon 's power over our imagination			1

the biggest - ever exhibition of @entity2 art has opened in @entity25
