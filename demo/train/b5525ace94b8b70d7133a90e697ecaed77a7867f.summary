-- while he 's enormously concerned about what secrets self - avowed @entity3 leaker @entity2 may yet spill , president @entity1 said thursday he 's not going to take extraordinary measures to capture him			1
" i 'm not going to be scrambling jets to get a 29 - year - old hacker , " he told reporters during a news conference in @entity9 , his first stop on a tour of several @entity13 nations			0
@entity1 had n't talked to leaders of @entity17 and @entity18 about @entity2 -- who actually turned 30 a few days ago -- in part because he did n't want to amp up the issue and have to start " wheeling and dealing " in order to get the fugitive in @entity24 custody			1
in a speech thursday , @entity3 director @entity25 ceded he 's worried there may be more leaks from @entity2			1
" these leaks have caused significant and irreversible damage to our nation 's security , " @entity25 said			1
" ... what is going on , in these leaks , is unconscionable in my opinion , it hurts our nation and our allies			2
and it 's flat wrong			0
" @entity2 has said he gave reporters information about secret surveillance out of concern these programs violate privacy rights and put too much power in the hands of government officials			2
as @entity2 seeks asylum , @entity24 bides its time @entity54 president @entity53 said tuesday his country would consider a formal request for political asylum from @entity2 -- which it had n't then received -- and foreign minister @entity58 reiterated that position thursday			1
another @entity61 country , @entity62 , is probably @entity2 's most widely rumored destination -- and subject of a growing spat with the @entity24 because of it			1
@entity2 has sought asylum there , the same country that has already agreed to shelter @entity71 founder @entity70 , albeit at its embassy in @entity73			2
on wednesday , @entity24 sen. @entity74 , @entity75 , said he would move to block @entity62 from two @entity24 free - trade programs should @entity2 go there			1
" our government will not reward countries for bad behavior , " he said			0
4 options for the @entity24 to get @entity2 back @entity62 presidential spokesman @entity82 responded thursday by saying his the nation would spare @entity74 and his @entity85 colleagues the trouble			1
" we will not accept any threats or pressure from anyone , " @entity82 told reporters			0
" we will not deal or trade in our principles			0
no matter how important the trade advantage may be			0
" the programs in question are n't free - trade agreements but @entity24 laws that do n't require @entity62 consent , so @entity82 's declaration may have little more than a symbolic effect			1
" i 'm not sure you can really withdraw from them one way or another , " @entity101 spokesman @entity100 said			0
while he did n't offer specifics , @entity100 did say he 'd expect " grave difficulties " in relations if @entity62 granted @entity2 asylum			1
the two countries have been at odds publicly , but remain linked economically			0
@entity62 , for instance , sent about $ 9.6 billion of goods to the @entity24 in 2011 , according to the @entity114			1
the head of the @entity62 @entity116 said he 's worried that " very important " commerce between the two nations could be negatively impacted as a result of this tiff			1
" it 's a risk to give asylum to @entity2 because the @entity24 , they could consider some economic sanction , including commercial sanctions , " said @entity121			1
still in @entity127 @entity2 apparently remained in limbo at @entity127 's airport , a free man according to @entity18 officials but with limited options			2
why would @entity2 head for @entity62 ? he did n't appear to board thursday 's flight from @entity127 to @entity135 , where he had been rumored to be heading on his way to @entity62 or some other safe haven			1
while he has applied to @entity62 for asylum , that request has not yet been " dealt with " because @entity2 is not in the country , @entity62 political affairs secretary @entity138 told reporters			1
she denied the country granted @entity2 refugee travel papers , as @entity70 told reporters this week			2
opinion : why @entity62 might shelter @entity2 @entity70 said @entity2 traveled from @entity147 to @entity127 on sunday using documents provided by @entity62			1
other governments have not specified what documents the former @entity152 employee and @entity3 contractor used to leave the semi-autonomous @entity17 territory , where he had gone to leak details of secret @entity24 telephone and internet surveillance programs			1
@entity24 officials have accused @entity17 of deliberately letting @entity2 leave			2
and they have expressed frustration with @entity18 's refusal to detain a man they portray almost as a common criminal -- on par with seven @entity18 fugitives @entity24 officials have repeatedly said they handed over to @entity18 in the past two years despite the lack of an extradition treaty			2
@entity2 and others have contended that he did @entity24 and the world a service by revealing information on secret programs , which they say wrongly impinge on people 's right to privacy in furtively giving too much information to the @entity24 government			1
but in his speech thursday in @entity183 , the head of the @entity3 argued -- as he 's done repeatedly in recent weeks -- that the programs both protect civil liberties and help keep @entity24 and its allies safe			1
@entity25 pointed to 54 related cases that @entity188 was informed about , of which 50 led to arrests or detentions			0
most of these were centered overseas , with 13 exceptions such as a foiled 2009 plot to bomb @entity196 's subway system			0
exposing the programs , he and others have said , makes it harder to spot terrorists and thus puts lives at risk			0
" i believe the irresponsible release of classified information about these programs will have a long - term detrimental impact on the intelligence community 's ability to detect future attacks , " @entity25 said			0
" these leaks have inflamed and sensationalized , for ignoble purposes , the work that ( the ) intelligence community does lawfully , over strict oversight and compliance			0
" possible @entity2 posts on wednesday , the technology website @entity217 published portions of chat logs it said show comments from 2009 by someone using a forum name @entity2 was known to have used			0
the comments criticized people who leak national security information			0
commenting on @entity228 reporting based on leaks related to confidential surveillance programs involving @entity231 , the poster compared the newspaper to @entity71 -- which enraged @entity24 officials by disclosing thousands of confidential diplomatic cables			2
" are they trying to start a war ? " the poster wrote			0
" you do n't put that s * * * in the newspaper			0
" @entity241 said it could not be certain the poster was @entity2 , but information revealed in the posts matches biographical information he has since publicly revealed			0
@entity0 could not verify the posts ' authenticity			0
if they were written by @entity2 , they offer insight into his thinking at a time when he apparently was more accepting of government surveillance programs			2
according to @entity217 , the poster said of the @entity228 and its reporting on secret surveillance programs , " these are the same people who blew the whole ' we could listen to osama 's cell phone ' thingthe same people who screwed us on wiretappingover and over and over @entity262 god they 're going out of business			0
" four years later , @entity2 would provide news organizations in the @entity24 and the @entity268 with classified information he acknowledged copying and taking from his job as a computer contractor for the @entity3 in @entity273			1
where could @entity2 go next ? @entity0 's @entity275 , @entity276 , @entity277 , @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 contributed to this report .			2
