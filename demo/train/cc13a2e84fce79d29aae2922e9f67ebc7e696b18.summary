-- @entity1 produced a dazzling performance to clinch the @entity3 in @entity4			1
the world no.1 birdied the last five holes to pip @entity7 by two shots and round off a phenomenal year			1
beginning the day leading the field alongside @entity11 , the @entity9 was forced to produce his brilliant best as his @entity14 teammate faded towards the end			1
@entity1 had fallen two shots off the lead following a bogey on the 13th as @entity18 bloomed in the @entity4 sunshine			1
@entity1 to duel with @entity21 glory @entity18 , ranked seven in the world , set a new course record with a bogey - free round of 10 - under par 62			1
but @entity1 , watched by tennis ace girlfriend @entity25 , produced an exquisite run of form down the final stretch to finish on six - under 66 and 23 - under for the tournament			1
and the 23 - year - old , who came into the tournament having already won the race to @entity32 , was thrilled with his latest triumph			1
@entity1 clinches money list double " i just wanted to finish the season the way i thought it deserved to be finished , " @entity1 told reporters			1
" i 've played so well throughout the year , and i did n't want to just let it tail off sort of timidly			0
i wanted to come here and finish in style			0
i was able to do it			0
" obviously going out today , myself and @entity11 ( @entity43 ) were tied for the lead , and we both did n't get off to the greatest of starts			0
" and then @entity7 had that incredible back nine , shot 62 , and i knew midway through the back nine i needed to do something special			2
" somehow i summoned up the energy from somewhere to make five birdies in the last five holes			2
it 's just a great way to end this tournament , a great way to end the season , and i am already excited about 2013			0
" it means a lot to me to win in this fashion , as well			0
i guess in a way , @entity7 gave me the opportunity to do what i did			2
" i guess seeing a target there and shooting at something , it definitely makes you more focused			0
" the 23 - under - par 265 recorded by @entity1 matched the lowest four - round aggregate in the four - year history of the tournament -- set by @entity69 in 2009			2
will @entity1 join @entity70 at @entity71 in $ 20m a year deal ? he also equaled the @entity74 's achievement of winning both the race to @entity32 and the @entity3 in the same season meanwhile , @entity18 was left to reflect on what might have been having gone close to making an eagle putt from 70 feet on the 13th only to miss by inches			1
he said : " that was a lot of fun			0
the front nine was just as good as the back nine , and the back nine putts started going in , which is a nice feeling			0
" but you know what @entity1 is capable of			2
fair play to him for making all those birdies down the stretch			0
" @entity11 , who led alongside @entity1 overnight , finished on 18 - under for the tournament after making two bogeys on the final round having not made any over the first 100 holes of the tournament			1
