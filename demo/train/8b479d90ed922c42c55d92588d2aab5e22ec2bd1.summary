@entity0 -- five former secretaries of state from both parties monday discussed how they would advise the next president on a wide range of foreign policy , including relations with @entity9 , @entity10 and the @entity11			1
" i would advise the president to fully engage with @entity16 , " former secretary of state @entity12 said at a @entity14 forum co-sponsored by @entity1			1
" i think it 's ridiculous for us to say we 're not going to talk to @entity16 , and yet the @entity19 have been negotiating peace with them for the last six or eight months			1
" @entity12 served under president @entity21			1
( the full comments will air on " the next president : a @entity24 " this saturday night at 9 p.m. et and again sunday at 2 p.m. et. ) @entity12 , who has endorsed @entity27 sen. @entity26 's presidential bid , appeared with former @entity28 secretaries of state @entity29 and @entity31 ; @entity32 , who served under @entity33 and @entity34 ; and former @entity21 secretary of state @entity35			1
@entity29 has been an active supporter of @entity37 presidential candidate sen. @entity36			0
@entity35 , who said he has not decided which candidate to back this year , said monday the election of an @entity46 - @entity43 president " would be electrifying , but at the same time [ i have to ] make a judgment here on which would be best for @entity43			1
" as the former diplomats urged a cautious approach in the conflict between @entity9 and @entity50 , @entity35 seemed to take a swipe at @entity26 's tough criticism of @entity53			1
" some debate in the presidential elections has basically been , ' we are all @entity50 now , ' " said @entity1 correspondent @entity54			2
" what does that mean ? it 's the same as was said after 9/11			0
" responded @entity35 , " one candidate said that , and i 'll let the candidate explain it for himself			2
" pressed to explain his response , the retired general said the crisis called for caution			0
" the fact of the matter is that you have to be very careful in a situation like this not just to leap to one side or the other until you take a good analysis of the whole situation ...			0
" the @entity9 is not going to become the @entity77 again			2
that movie failed at the box office			0
but they do have interests			0
and we have to think carefully about their interests			0
" when the crisis began in early august , the @entity36 campaign called " for all sides to show restraint and to stop this armed conflict , " echoing the statements from the @entity91 and the @entity92			0
@entity32 told the panel the @entity43 needs " @entity9 for resolution of the @entity10 problem			1
we may need @entity9 if @entity96 evolves in some of the directions that it might			2
" " i would urge the new president , as i 'm urging this president , to explore the possibilities of cooperation and be very sure before we go the route of cutting off @entity105 [ @entity105 ] and the other international measures for which cooperation with @entity9 may be very important , " he said			2
@entity12 said the @entity43 needs to cooperate with @entity9 " where we can , where it makes sense , but we ought to also be willing to confront them where our vital interests are involved			1
we are committed to the independence of these former republics of the @entity115			0
" the former secretaries of state also focused their attention on talks with @entity10			1
the @entity21 administration joined the other members of the @entity122 -- @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity9 , along with @entity126 -- in offering @entity10 a set of political and economic incentives similar to the ones @entity130 was given in exchange for suspending its uranium enrichment program			1
but the @entity43 has refused to sit down with @entity10 until that suspension takes place			1
" when i was in office , we had a standing policy with the @entity10			2
we were ready to talk to them , provided it would be done at an official level , at the level of the secretary of state , and they did -- they would n't -- they did n't have enough domestic political support for that , " @entity12 said			1
@entity32 added : " well , i am in favor of negotiating with @entity10			1
and one utility of negotiation is to put before @entity10 our vision of a @entity11 , of a stable @entity11 , and our notion on nuclear proliferation at a high enough level so that they have to study it			2
and , therefore , i actually have preferred doing it at the secretary of state level so that we -- we know we 're dealing with authentic			0
" @entity29 told the panel that she does n't think the @entity43 understands @entity10 society and that could be a problem in dealing with the nation			1
" it is not monolithic			0
there are various aspects of the fact that [ @entity10 president @entity168 ] @entity167 is not particularly popular			2
and the more that we go around vilifying them , we create -- put him a stronger position			0
and so not only should we do these steps that the others have been talking about , but we have to make sure that we 're not undercutting what we want to do by creating a bigger problem than we have			0
" @entity31 said checking the authenticity of the negotiations is a key factor			0
" i think the first thing you do when you 've got a message from the @entity10 is to find out whether it 's authentic or not , " he said			1
" then , i think you have to move forward			0
... we ca n't be complacent about the nuclear possibilities in @entity10 , but nevertheless we can not afford not to have a comprehensive dialogue to see if it can be stopped because , frankly , the military options here are very , very poor			0
