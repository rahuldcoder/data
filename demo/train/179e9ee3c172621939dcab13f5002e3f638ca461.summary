-- what may be the most famous religious relic of them all , the @entity1 , made a rare appearance on @entity6 -- on @entity8 ' tv screens			1
one of @entity10 's last acts as pope , according to @entity12 , was to authorize the broadcast of video of the shroud from @entity16 , where the mysterious @entity18 relic is kept , out of sight , in a bulletproof , climate - controlled glass case			1
according to @entity12 , only once before have images of the centuries - old linen cloth been broadcast			2
that was in 1973 , at the request of then - pope @entity25			0
some @entity26 believe the shroud , which appears to bear the imprint of a man 's body , to be @entity32 's burial cloth			1
the body appears to have wounds that match those the @entity36 describes as having been suffered by @entity32 on the cross			2
many scholars contest the shroud 's authenticity , saying it dates to the @entity42 , when many purported biblical relics -- like splinters from @entity32 ' cross -- surfaced across @entity46			1
even the @entity47 does not insist the shroud was used to wrap the body of @entity32			1
its official position is that the shroud is an important tool for faith regardless of its authenticity			0
archbishop of @entity56 will lead a service from the cathedral on saturday afternoon during which the images of the shroud will be broadcast , according to @entity12			1
a video message from @entity62 was played as part of the broadcast			1
in it , he thanked @entity67 for the technological advances that have made it possible for the " @entity70 " to be seen by , and reach out to , so many people			0
" this image , impressed upon the cloth , speaks to our heart , " he said			1
" this disfigured face resembles all those faces of men and women marred by a life which does not respect their dignity , by war and violence which afflict the weakest ... and yet , at the same time , the face in the @entity1 conveys a great peace ; this tortured body expresses a sovereign majesty			1
" to coincide with the television broadcast , a new @entity1 2.0 app was launched friday			1
the app , released in several languages , allows users to scroll over a high - definition image of the shroud and find out more about its history and religious significance			0
@entity98 , a professor of mechanical engineering at @entity100 in @entity8 and co-author of the book " @entity103 , " said the app will be " very useful " to the scientific community			2
until now , researchers have not had access to a digitalized picture of the shroud , he told @entity0			0
studies looking into the formation of the image have been based on macroscopic data			0
" i hope the app will give us the chance of having microscopic data that will be very useful to confront different scientific research on the shroud , which , until now , is still a mystery , " he said			0
in 2010 : @entity120 prays before @entity1 disputed dating carbon dating conducted in the 1980s suggested the shroud dates from the @entity42			1
but researchers at @entity100 say their more recent tests show the cloth does indeed date back to between 280 @entity127 and 220 a.d. -- which could place it within @entity32 's lifetime @entity98 's book , written with religious journalist @entity131 and published last year , spells out those findings			1
" we carried out three alternative dating tests on the shroud , two chemical and one mechanical , and they all gave the same result and they all traced back to the date of @entity32 , with a possible margin of error of 250 years , " @entity98 told @entity0			1
for the mechanical test , they constructed a machine at @entity100 to carry out traction and compression tests on tiny fibers from the linen fabric , measuring only 10 thousandths of a millimeter , he said			2
the test samples were found in dust from the shroud , he said			0
@entity56 said , " ... since there is no degree of security on the belonging of the materials on which these experiments were carried out to the sheet @entity1 , the @entity160 and custodian declare that it can not recognize any serious value to the results of these alleged experiments			2
" author and historian @entity165 uses the image of the @entity1 on the cover of his book , " @entity169 , " which reveals new details around the crucifixion			0
in 2010 : shroud of @entity16 on display for first time since 2002 restoration the new research into whether the linen cloth dates back to @entity32 ' time is fascinating , he said			1
" my understanding is that there 's not unshakeable evidence but it 's more difficult to dismiss the shroud now , " he told @entity0 's @entity180			0
" some of the scientific evidence has proven that it is , as you say , older , that there are some inexplicable factors , in the stains and the composition of it			0
" he chose to put the shroud 's image on his book cover " because it 's simply an icon of @entity32 in this generation , " he said , whether its origins are proven or not			1
" people say , ' that 's maybe the oldest picture of @entity32 ' -- they do n't think of it being something that has to be scientifically confirmed , " he added			2
' truly mysterious image ' @entity10 prayed before the shroud in 2010 , when it went on display for six weeks at @entity16 , its first public showing since undergoing a major restoration in 2002			0
before that , it was last on display in 2000			0
the shroud -- more than 14 feet long and 3 feet , 7 inches wide -- was restored to remove a patchwork repair done by 16th century nuns after the cloth was damaged in a fire			0
thirteen years ago , when @entity10 was still cardinal @entity10 , he wrote that the shroud was " a truly mysterious image , which no human artistry was capable of producing			0
" the shroud is not scheduled to go on public view again for more than a decade , so the tv broadcast represents a rare chance for the faithful to get a glimpse of the famous relic			2
religious relics : @entity231 bones could be @entity232 's as claimed , scientists say			0

new : @entity120 's message says the " @entity237 " speaks to the heart of the faithful
video of the @entity1 is broadcast from the city 's cathedral on saturday
some @entity26 believe it to be @entity32 's burial cloth but many scientists disagree
new tests show the shroud could date back to time of @entity32 , says @entity100 professor
