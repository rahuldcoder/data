-- a @entity2 police officer won his appeal monday at the @entity4 , after being sued for chasing a suspect onto private property without a warrant			1
at issue is whether a homeowner 's " expectation of privacy " was violated , since there was no " immediate danger " to law enforcement and the alleged offense -- disobeying the police -- was a misdemeanor			1
the justices said officer @entity18 of the @entity19 had " qualified immunity " from civil claims of unreasonable search and seizure			1
" there is no suggestion in this case that officer @entity18 knowingly violated the @entity30 , " specifically the @entity31 , said the unsigned opinion from the high court			1
" @entity18 may have been mistaken in believing his actions were justified , but he was not ' plainly incompetent			0
' " judges generally give wide latitude in justifying police chases involving felonies and use of weapons , but in cases where the circumstances are less clear , there can be tricky legal questions like those presented here			0
the incident happened in may 2008 , in a neighborhood east of @entity46 that lower courts had said was known for " violence associated with drug gangs			0
" @entity18 and his partner responded to a 911 call about an " unknown disturbance " concerning a person with a baseball bat			0
the officers arrived in their marked vehicle , saw three people and ordered them to stop			0
one of the men , who carried no noticeable weapon , ran into a nearby fenced residential yard			0
@entity18 pursued , and believing the suspect had committed a misdemeanor , made the " split - second " decision to kick open a 6 - foot - high gate			0
the owner of the property , @entity65 , happened to be on the other side of the gate and was struck when it flew inward , cutting her forehead and injuring her shoulder			0
@entity72 sued in federal court , alleging the officer invaded her home without a warrant			1
a judge agreed with the officer , saying the situation was potentially dangerous , @entity18 " feared for his safety " and he was justified going after the fleeing suspect			1
but a federal appeals court in @entity83 found for @entity72 , allowing the lawsuit to proceed			1
now , the high court has reversed , saying previous rulings made clear that @entity18 deserved immunity from civil claims			2
the conservative majority court in recent years has given the benefit of the doubt to law enforcement in a number of cases involving searches of private property			2
" @entity18 was in hot pursuit of " the suspect , said the high court			2
" he did see ( the suspect ) enter @entity72 ' property , and he had every reason to believe that the suspect was just beyond @entity72 ' gate			2
" the issue was thrown back to the lower courts to be sorted out , after the @entity4 's conclusions , and could lead to the lawsuit 's final dismissal			1
the case is @entity18 v. @entity72 ( 12 - 1217 ) .			0
