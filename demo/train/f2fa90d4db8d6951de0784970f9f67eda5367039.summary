@entity0 , @entity1 -- as i write this from a conference of 3500 @entity7 fans outside of the @entity9 theme park in @entity0 , the energy in the air around the final film is not only excitement , but gratitude			1
we are grateful for the bonds of friendship we have made in this fan community and grateful for those " other friends " we know we can always visit in @entity21 's hut , to sit down over tea and rock cakes and plot new adventures			0
we 've spent years being called " delusional " for taking the @entity25 , the @entity26 at @entity27 , and the sweet shops in @entity29 so seriously -- as if they were real			1
as if they were nothing more than a cheap way to escape from our daily reality			0
but as the book comes to a close , @entity35 reminds us that " of course it is happening inside [ our ] head ... but why on earth should that mean that it is not real ? " reality is mysterious			2
and the reality is that a fantasy book aimed at children has forever changed writing , publishing , literature , music , sports , social media and social activism			0
in a digital age filled with families lining up for @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity58 , there was one exception to the rule : for well over a decade , millions lined up at midnight to get their hands on a copy of a hardback book			0
translated into almost every language as it seamlessly cuts across cultures , @entity7 became the most requested book by detainees in @entity70 ( outside of the @entity71 )			1
the reality is that @entity7 has taught a generation to be creative , compassionate and courageous as we continue to love			1
for some , the final film means it 's an end of an era			2
not for me and not for most fans			2
as we approach the final film in the @entity7 franchise , i 'd like to point out that the moment in book seven when a @entity87 is holding " opens at the close " so too does the @entity88 -- our minds , our hearts , all open at the close			1
like the snitch , we " open at the close			0
" the advent of the seventh movie is not an ending , but an opportunity to take what we have learned at @entity27 into the world			2
the organization that i run , the @entity97 , inspiriing fellow fans to act as @entity99 would in our world			1
we 've sent five cargo planes to @entity102 , donated more than 88,000 books across the world and funded the protection of civilians in @entity107 and @entity108			2
right now we are negotiating with the ceo of @entity110 to make all @entity7 chocolate fair trade so that the @entity7 brand is no longer associated with the practice of child slavery that is common in the cocoa trade			1
to date we have the signatures of more than 15,000 @entity7 fans including four stars of the films			1
in a world that is , like @entity99 's , often in dark and difficult times , we in the @entity88 are ready to open at the close			0
we are ready ms. @entity123 , @entity99 , and @entity35			0
thank you for preparing us			0
we look forward to this last film and we will see you soon !			0
