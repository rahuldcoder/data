-- amid the rumblings of war between @entity4 and @entity5 , just how do you go about your everyday life ? with foreboding and fear , according to former @entity5 football international @entity9			1
" everyone is scared about war -- they are very nervous , " @entity9 , who enjoyed a successful spell in the @entity14 with @entity15 , told @entity0			1
more than once during our interview , @entity9 seemed desperate to deliver this message : " it is important the whole world supports us			1
" he was speaking from his mother 's home in @entity24 , @entity5 , on monday , after flying there from @entity25 , where he lives with his wife and children			2
he wanted to visit following the events of the past few weeks			0
@entity9 , who was born in in the western city of @entity30 , last held a managerial job with @entity32 -- a club based in @entity33 , an autonomous region of eastern @entity5 with strong loyalty to @entity4			1
" here in @entity24 , it 's ok but in @entity33 and places like @entity39 and elsewhere , people are worried			0
where there is a large population of @entity4 , they are scared , " he said			1
" everyone is scared about war			0
it 's scary for the children , for the adults , for everyone			0
" i hope the world can see what is going on and will speak out			0
" what he has witnessed on his television screen , and heard while speaking to his friends , has ignited a passion for his country 's right to self - determination			0
@entity5 has been in chaos since president @entity62 was ousted on february 22 following bloody street protests which left many dead and hundreds injured			1
a deepening split within @entity5 society has seen those in the western part of the country supporting the interim government and ties with the @entity72 , while those in the east advocate a @entity4 presence in @entity5			1
@entity33 , where @entity4 has sent more troops , remains firmly opposed to the new political leadership in @entity24			2
@entity5 suspects @entity4 of fomenting tension in the autonomous region and fears it might escalate into a bid for separation by its @entity4 majority population			1
@entity82 , the country 's interim prime minister , accused @entity84 of declaring war and insisted his west - leaning government would not give up the @entity33 region			0
but as words are traded by politicians around tables and via television screens , among the people , trepidation over @entity5 's future only grows			1
" @entity4 is aggressive against many countries not just @entity5 , " said @entity9 , who admitted he did not understand @entity4 president @entity96 's tactics			1
" they went into @entity99 in 2008 and now they have gone into @entity5 , " added @entity9 , referring to the five - day conflict between @entity99 and @entity4			1
" i do n't understand what he is doing or what he wants to gain from doing this			0
" nobody understands why he is doing this , for what ? " he says that it 's to defend @entity4 people , but the @entity4 people in @entity5 that i know are saying , ' we are ok ' -- they do n't need any help			1
" @entity84 has defended its parliament 's approval to use military force to protect its citizens in the @entity33			0
in the @entity121 , a senior @entity120 official told @entity0 on sunday that @entity4 forces " have complete operational control of the @entity33			2
" the official said the @entity121 estimates there are 6,000 @entity4 ground and naval forces in the region			2
" there is no question that they are in an occupation position -- flying in reinforcements and settling in , " another senior administration official said			0
the move by @entity4 has been met with fear and anger in @entity5 while it has also been condemned by world leaders			1
@entity140 secretary - general @entity139 has urged the @entity4 to " refrain from any acts and rhetoric that can further escalate the situation and instead engage constructively and through peaceful means with @entity5			1
" @entity9 , who was part of the famous @entity147 team of the 1990s which included @entity149 and @entity150 , says he enjoyed his time working in @entity33 before leaving in june last year			1
he still has friends in the region and while they are all ok , he says that the rise in tensions within @entity5 is unimaginable			2
" when i was growing up i never thought this would happen			0
nobody would have thought this situation would happen , " he said			0
" everybody is surprised because nobody thought for a second that @entity96 would go into @entity5			1
ask anybody if they expected this to happen and they would have said you were crazy and that it would be impossible			0
" in @entity24 , @entity9 says life is returning to normal following the protests which raged for several days			2
he is at a loss to understand the decision to move @entity5 's international friendly game with the @entity121 to @entity173 on march 5			1
it was originally scheduled for the eastern city of @entity176 , but @entity9 believes it could still have been played on home soil -- even though the domestic championship has been suspended			2
" there is no more trouble in @entity24 , it is absolutely fine , " he said			0
that can not be said for @entity33 and @entity39 , where tension continues to rise as the world waits to see how this situation plays out			0
" i do n't know what is going to happen next , " said @entity9			0
" i think we will see something happen in the next few days because the whole world is watching @entity96			2
" it is so important that the world sees what is going on			0
" we need their support , " adds @entity9 in one last plaintive refrain .			0
