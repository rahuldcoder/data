-- an online campaign has started to right a 22 - year - old wrong committed against legendary architect @entity3			1
she and @entity5 , her partner and husband , have designed iconic buildings together for 40 years -- yet she was excluded when @entity5 was awarded the highest honor in architecture in 1991 , the @entity10			1
the cause has created an unusual outcry across the architecture profession			1
started by two young women active in the @entity17 at @entity18 , the @entity15 campaign has generated more than 11,000 signatures , nine of whom are @entity10 winners			2
it 's a worthy cause , and reflects the dismissive attitude toward women in architecture even today			1
endowed by the @entity28 , the $ 100,000 prize has twice been awarded to pairs of architects , both times at the request of the individual to whom the award was originally intended to go			2
with only one exception , however , female partners have consistently been overlooked			1
just last year , @entity38 architect @entity37 was honored without his partner and wife , @entity41			2
only two women have won the @entity10 in its 34 year history			0
since 1991 , @entity5 has repeatedly insisted that @entity3 was an equal collaborator and should share the honor with him			1
it 's not a hard case to make : @entity3 co-wrote the highly influential book " learning from @entity49 " in 1972 , and has been widely known and appreciated in the field			1
@entity3 described @entity5 as being " as brave as you could possibly expect him to be " in his support			1
still , they decided " we could not afford to pass up the @entity10 for the sake of our fledgling firm			0
" she is calling for a ceremony to recognize her contributions to the firm 's work , which includes the @entity62 of the @entity63 in @entity64 and the @entity66 house			0
@entity67 , one of the two female @entity69 honorees , has admonished her profession , saying she doubted anything has changed for women in architecture over the last 30 years			1
" i have quite a few senior architects in the office and they are extremely reliable and very talented , but , when i taught , all of my best students were women , " she told @entity74			2
" then they drift off			0
" what @entity67 characterizes as " drifting off " is , in truth , a mass exodus			0
although just about as many women as men study in @entity84 architecture schools , only about 16 % of the licensed architects in the @entity84 are women			1
the number is slightly higher in the @entity89 , where around 20 % of qualified architects are women			2
like other professions with notoriously " leaky pipelines , " many women drop out of architecture during the onerous final stages			2
after five to seven years of education , aspiring architects must complete an internship and a costly , multipart licensing exam , which takes an average of 8.5 years to complete			0
only then , after years of low pay , does the profession confer the title of architect			0
this career phase directly corresponds with women 's childbearing years , forcing many to choose between becoming a mother or an architect			0
to be sure , a precious few do both , but they often have a partner who stays home or they can pay someone else to provide domestic labor and child care while they put in long hours at the office			0
but it 's not just the licensing process and the culture of workaholism that push women out			0
it 's also sexism in the workplace and the profession at large			0
in a january 2013 study by @entity130 , nearly two - thirds of @entity89 female architects said they have suffered gender discrimination or male bullying at work			1
nearly half the women reported they received lower pay than their male counterparts , and 60 % said they have encountered building industry clients who failed or refused to recognize their authority			1
no comparable study has been completed in the @entity84			0
as has so often been said , you ca n't be what you ca n't see			0
it 's not easy for women who aspire to be architects to find female role models			1
women are just a small minority of firm leaders			0
a survey conducted by the @entity151 found that in 2012 , women made up only 17 % of firm principals and partners			2
just two women have served as presidents of the @entity151 in its 155 - year history , although a third will do so in 2014			0
the @entity151 's recent promotion of @entity161 's " @entity162 " doll as a recruitment tool to interest young girls overlooks the cultural and institutional sexism in the profession			0
when asked about the @entity151 , @entity3 reported that each time @entity5 has been put forward for the organization 's highest honor , the @entity171 , the couple responded as a team			1
" the @entity151 has always returned the submission , unopened , " she said , because the organization knew @entity5 and @entity3 were applying together			1
in the end , @entity3 receiving equal recognition for a 22 - year - old slight is not the point			2
the bigger issue is that the gender disparity in architecture , both symbolically and substantially , is not just a problem for women ; it 's a problem for all of us			2
how might our shared built environment -- our homes , hospitals , schools , workplaces and public spaces -- be shaped differently if women were behind half the proverbial blueprints ? how would it be different with the contributions of architects from racial minority groups , who make up only 2 % of the profession ? it is not a question of whether , but to what extent , buildings are less beautiful , less functional , less equitable because women are not creating them			1
@entity205 famously noted , " we shape our buildings , and afterward our buildings shape us			0
" as is so often the case in other areas , our public landscape and the architecture profession are shaped by only a small fraction of our potential collective genius , and limited by the creative absence of so many			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writers .			0

architects @entity3 and @entity5 are partners , yet only he was honored
writers : movement afoot to recognize @entity3 in the male dominated profession
they say female architects ' *marginalization* is a loss to our public landscape
architecture is missing the creative input of women and minorities , they say
