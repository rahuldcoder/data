-- a woman whose same - sex partner was killed in last month 's stage collapse at the @entity4 joined a personal injury attorney in pushing a federal lawsuit against the state of @entity8 on behalf of those injured and the families of those killed			1
the lawsuit seeks to overturn the state 's $ 5 million cap on damages that can be paid out on what lawyer @entity16 called " a first - come , first - serve basis			1
" it also addresses what he described as " unfairness ( and ) prejudice toward gay and lesbian couples " who might not be entitled to payments , if their civil unions or marriages are n't recognized in @entity8			2
@entity16 was joined at a @entity30 press conference by @entity31 , who spoke publicly for the first since suffering severe head and other injuries in the collapse			1
her long - time partner @entity36 -- an activist for gay and lesbian rights and health issues with whom she officially was joined in a civil union in @entity42 in june -- was killed , as were six others			1
" she fought for everything that she believed in , and i believe she 's still fighting , " @entity44 said			2
" we 're going to do it			2
we 're not going to stop			2
" @entity44 was among at least 40 people injured august 13 when the scaffolding collapsed during a severe thunderstorm that blew through the area just before country music duo @entity52 was set to perform			1
the structure fell onto fans gathered in front of the stage minutes after authorities had addressed the audience about the approaching storm			2
@entity16 claims that the lawsuit aims to compel @entity8 to change its policies			2
that includes what he called its " puzzling " and " wrong " cap on how much the state can pay out " no matter how many people are harmed , now matter how many are injured			1
" " they 're attempting to throw a bowl of crumbs to a bunch of pigeons , " he said			0
" our clients are n't pigeons			0
" the lawyer alleged that the event 's organizers " cut every corner that they possibly could , " calling their actions before and during that night " reckless			1
" he claimed that the fact there was a limit on possible damages did n't give enough incentive to take every safety precaution			1
@entity8 attorney general @entity89 told @entity0 affiliate @entity90 that he is not aware of a prior case where the courts have overturned caps on damages -- something that @entity16 acknowledged monday , saying " this case is without precedent			1
" yet the most emotional part of monday 's press conference came from @entity44 , who still carried bruises and cuts to her head six weeks after the accident			0
she said it was initially a " perfect night " for her , @entity106 and others			0
then at one point , she recalled , someone came on stage to say the storm would " move around us " while adding that an evacuation was possible			0
" five minutes later , i was knocked unconscious , " @entity44 said through tears			0
" and i never saw ( @entity106 ) again			0
" @entity16 said that he would fight so that @entity44 would get the same benefits as a wife might get if she lost her husband in the collapse			1
" we should not stand by and allow this inequality , " the lawyer said , calling gay and lesbian rights " the last frontier of equal protection			1
" " it makes no difference ( if a couple is straight or gay , as long as they ) love each other and are committed to each other			0
" in addition to monday 's lawsuit , the state faces 21 other potential lawsuits related to the collapse , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity138			2
the @entity139 , the state 's @entity140 and an independent company hired by the state fair commission are all conducting investigations into the incident			0
" our goal is to learn everything we can why this tragedy occurred			0
we wo n't leave any question unanswered , from both a structural standpoint and the decision that was made , " @entity4 chairman @entity149 said last month			1
" we know that many are eager for answers today			0
we do n't have them			0
and we wo n't speculate			0
