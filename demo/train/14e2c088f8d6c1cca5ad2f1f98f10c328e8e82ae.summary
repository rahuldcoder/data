@entity0 -- one hundred and two canvases all with similar composition but different colors hung edge - to - edge make up the totality of @entity8 's painting called " shadows " currently on display at the @entity11 in @entity0			1
this marks the first time all of the canvases , which were completed over thirty years ago , have been displayed together as @entity8 intended			1
there are n't many museums with enough unbroken wall space to hold the entire piece			0
the canvases , each measuring four by six feet are hung edge - to - edge as the artist intended covering a continuous 451 linear feet on the gallery wall making it longer than a football field			1
" these galleries are just curved enough to give you flow , or push our visitors through the space , " said associate curator @entity25			0
" there 's this kind of beautiful dialogue or conversation between the art and the architecture			0
" " it gives you goose bumps			0
it shows the elasticity of the painting and the concept , " said @entity39 , a curator at the @entity40 that owns the painting			0
only 83 canvases of the work were shown at the first displayed in 1979 at the @entity49 gallery in @entity50			1
they took up several galleries , the continuity broken every time the work came to a corner or a door			2
" on the one hand , this installation is about the gestalt , the overwhelming effect of seeing all of these paintings that continue beyond the realm of sight , " said @entity25			0
" and then , it 's about looking at the individual objects at the same time			2
" the artist used seventeen different colors from chartreuse to @entity69 acid green to a dull brown to create the backgrounds for the canvases			1
then one of two styles of " peaks " was silk screened onto the backgrounds , creating a repetitive pattern when the canvases are hung side - by - side			1
the type of paint stroke used for the backgrounds varies , so that even the canvases with similar colors look different up close			0
the silk screened image or " shadow " is always flat			0
" it 's a silk screen that i mop over with paint , " said @entity8 about the shadows when it was first displayed			1
and the curators believe that @entity8 , or perhaps one of his assistants , did use an actual mop when creating some of the backgrounds			2
the february 1979 issue of @entity96 quotes @entity8 saying , " someone asked me if i though they were art and i said no. you see , the opening party had a disco			2
i guess that makes them disco @entity106 " in the late 1970s , @entity8 experimented with abstractions , a departure from the pop culture inspired works for which he is known			1
" this work comes in a moment when he is reinventing what he wants to do as a painter , " said @entity39 pointing out @entity8 stuck with the vivid colors that he had used since the early 1960s			2
pragmatically , hanging the paintings edge - to - edge was not as easy as you might think @entity25 said because the canvas frames have warped over time			1
" humidity changes the canvas and changes the center bar that the canvas is on , " she said			0
" @entity126 changes , so none of them are perfectly straight			0
to hang them edge - to - edge and keep them straight is an extraordinary task			1
" " shadows " will be on exhibit at the @entity11 , the @entity134 's museum dedicated to modern and contemporary art until january 15 , 2012			0
across the @entity138 from the @entity11 at the @entity139 , more of @entity8 's art can be seen in an exhibit on to his work with news headlines that runs through january 2 , 2012 .			2
