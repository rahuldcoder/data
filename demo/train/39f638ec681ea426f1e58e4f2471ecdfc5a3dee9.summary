editor 's note : in our @entity5 series , @entity3 correspondents share their experiences covering the news			2
here , @entity3 anchor @entity9 describes spending some time with day laborers for a report that will air on ' out in the @entity12 ' tonight at 8 et. @entity3 's @entity9 , pictured center , visits a street corner where many people gather to seek manual labor jobs			1
@entity17 , @entity18 ( @entity3 ) -- for four hours friday morning , i joined about 200 immigrants -- legal and illegal -- at a day - laborer site at the corner of @entity23 and @entity24 in downtown @entity17 , @entity18			1
my goal was not to find a job ; rather it was to see how day laborers go about finding one themselves			1
dressed in jeans , running shoes and a short - sleeve shirt , i looked like one of them			2
i also carried over my shoulder a bag containing a hidden camera			2
day laborer sites like this one have sprung up all over the country			2
the laborers -- mostly immigrants , mostly men -- come to them to find jobs in construction or masonry or painting or landscaping			1
some communities encourage the formation of these sites			2
in others , they have become lightning rods of controversy			0
in @entity17 , they have become fixtures			1
at the site i visited , the last thing the folks there needed was more competition for jobs , but they nonetheless welcomed me into their group			0
they gave me pointers about how to get a good job			1
" always ask how much , " one man told me in @entity66 as he prepped me in the art of negotiating for a days ' wage			1
another said it 's better to be paid by the day instead of the hour			0
that way you 're assured of a decent payment even if the work is cut short or the job is finished early			1
the guys i met told me they come here seven days a week			1
they wait and wait and wait for work			1
" sometimes there 's no work , sometimes there is work			1
not every day , " one man said			0
it gets worse when winter comes			0
" when it 's cold , there 's no work , " another told me			1
a good week , they said , is one where they get offered jobs on two days for about $ 90 a day			1
that 's a weekly salary of $ 180			1
it 's barely enough to put food on the table , but it 's better than the alternative			0
life in @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101 , they said , offers little in the way of income -- about $ 5 a week for manual labor			1
" we do n't have a choice but to try to save a little bit and go back to our country , " a 23 - year - old @entity99 man told me			0
the routine is simple : show up early and wait for hours until a prospective employer shows up , if one shows up			0
as more people flock to these sites the competition for jobs gets intense			0
" there are a lot of people ... and i mean a lot of people at the stop here			0
so you no longer get a lot of work , " the @entity99 said			2
on friday , i was there for 3Â½ hours until i finally witnessed a job offer			0
it came from , ironically , another immigrant			0
he was from the @entity129 , @entity130 , new in @entity131 himself , and delighted to provide work for fellow immigrants			1
he was looking for someone to help him move furniture and other belongings			0
these immigrants -- the @entity130 with a job and the @entity139 seeking work -- negotiated the job terms in broken @entity142 , with @entity130 and @entity66 accents swirling in the air			2
" i need two , " said the @entity130 employer referring to the number of workers			0
" two dollars is not enough , " responded the @entity99			0
after much arm waving and false starts , they eventually figured out what the other was saying and a deal was struck			0
many of the men here have a love - hate relationship with the @entity131			1
they miss their home countries but feel compelled to stay here out of economic necessity			1
" all you get in this country is bitterness , sadness and loneliness , " one man told me			0
" but money , " i interjected			2
" of course , that 's true , " he responded			0
" first place is ... the money , that 's why we come			2
" e-mail to a friend @entity3 's @entity175 contributed to this report .			0

laborers in @entity17 say two days of work at $ *90/day* is a good week
they hope to earn enough money to send some to family in other countries
some seem bitter about life in the @entity131 , but claim they stay for the money
