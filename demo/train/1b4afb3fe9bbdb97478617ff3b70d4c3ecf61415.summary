while illuminating the path to a new wave of green energy projects			1
shining beacon : the concentrated solar power plant in @entity14 , @entity4 is the first of its kind			1
the 624 carefully positioned mirrors reflect the sun 's heat towards a 50 meter - tall central tower where it is concentrated and used to boil water into steam			0
the superheated steam is then used to turn a turbine that can produce up to 11 megawatts of electricity -- enough power for 6,000 homes -- according @entity29 , the @entity4 company that has built the power plant			1
while traditional solar panels , photovoltaic cells , convert the sun 's power directly into electricity , @entity8 focuses power from a wide area and uses the vast heat generated to make electricity in a similar way to that produced from coal or oil			1
the @entity4 tower , known as @entity45 , is the first phase of an ambitious development			2
by 2013 it is hoped that additional towers will create a " solar farm " with an output of 300 megawatts , which would be enough power for 180,000 homes , or equivalent to the entire population of nearby @entity3			2
this $ 1.5 billion project is the largest commercial @entity8 station in the world -- so far			2
but many believe the technology will soon take off in areas of continuous hot sun and clear skies , offering a cheaper and more efficient alternative to photovoltaic cells , and bringing jobs and money to arid , often depressed areas			0
@entity8 also produces no greenhouses gasses and the only pollution is visual			2
the @entity70 has invested over $ 31 million in @entity8 research over the last ten years			2
at least 50 @entity8 projects have been given permission to begin construction across @entity4			1
by 2015 the country may be producing two gigawatts of electricity from @entity8 , and employing thousands in the industry			2
one of the strengths of @entity8 is that it allows the construction of power stations on a scale that can match many fossil fuel based plants , and for an investment far less than that required to install the equivalent wattage of photovoltaic cells			1
there is also the possibility that production can keep going around the clock -- even when the sun has gone down			0
@entity29 is currently testing technology at a plant near @entity96 that will pump 50 percent of the electricity generated in the day into the @entity4 national grid , and use the other 50 percent to melt salt , which will then act as a kind of battery , storing the sun 's power			1
when dusk falls , the heat stored in the molten salt can be used to generate power through the night			0
" these technologies excite me , " says dr @entity108 , network manager at the @entity110			0
" one of the real advantages is that you can get a decent sized power plant			0
" the main challenge with the technology is working with extreme heat , but then a lot of the back - end is very similar to a traditional fossil - fuel generation ; you are after all just dealing with water heated to make steam and drive a turbine			0
" concentrating on promoting @entity8 worldwide as @entity125 looks to increase the contribution of renewables to its overall energy mix -- a key part of the @entity131 plan before the recession turbocharged government funding for such " green " infrastructure projects -- the potential of @entity8 technology is obvious			1
the @entity4 company responsible for the @entity14 plant has seen the potential and created @entity139 , a subsidiary aiming to develop the market in the @entity125			1
there is already a huge @entity144 ' @entity8 station in the @entity145 , @entity146 ; @entity4 firm @entity147 has built a plant near @entity149			1
many more are surely on their way			0
one bold projection estimates that a single plant 100 miles by 100 miles located in the @entity155 could generate enough electricity for the whole country			0
it would obviously be a huge undertaking -- politically , financially and scientifically -- but it 's not hard to imagine such a scheme finding a home in the nation 's vast , empty quarter			0
other equally arid areas may also find themselves transformed , and @entity8 may be able to offer valuable foreign earnings for drought - stricken @entity167 -- while giving @entity168 the green energy it needs			1
according to dr @entity108 the technology has a ready application , given the right political , environmental and economic context			0
" @entity8 is proven to do well in countries like @entity4 with a favorable government policies and the right climate , " he says			1
" i can certainly see the potential for extended networks linking together , and the idea of a @entity167 grid linking renewable resources is a real possibility			0
" providing power , jobs and money the @entity187 , the world 's largest desert , is fringed by some of the poorest countries in the world and the harsh environment has always been seen as a problem , with it 's vast , waterless interior regularly reaching temperatures of over 45 degrees @entity197			2
but with large - scale @entity8 projects , suddenly all that empty space , with its year - round clear skies and hot sun , has a value that could transform local economies			1
it could potentially turn @entity167 into a net exporter of energy to power - hungry @entity168 , and perhaps even do for countries in @entity167 what oil did for @entity209			2
estimates vary , but one projection from the @entity213 puts the amount of solar energy stored in just one per cent of the @entity187 -- 35,000 square miles , or a piece of land slightly smaller than @entity218 -- as having the potential to yield more power than all the world 's existing power plants combined			1
already @entity4 firms are exporting @entity8 technology to @entity226 and @entity227 , and a @entity229 consortium , the @entity223 , is testing the technology in the deserts of @entity232			1
costs and benefits however , there is a problem : at the moment costs are still very high			2
but they are falling as plants get bigger , the technology is perfected and economies of scale kick in			0
even so , any plans to power @entity168 from the @entity187 would require a vast infrastructure of @entity8 plants and cables laid across the @entity248 -- requiring billions upon billions of dollars in investment			1
such sums will only be possible through international co-operation on a huge scale			0
but on a smaller , more local scale a simple change in the way electricity generators are paid has been hugely effective in boosting renewable power			0
in @entity4 and other @entity168 countries investment has been encouraged by governments creating what 's known as a " feed in tariff , " which pays companies a premium for power sold to the national grid generated by renewable means for a fixed period of time			1
this enables investors to pay back up front costs more quickly			0
where they have been introduced they have brought about a huge increase in renewable power : @entity277 has 200 times as much solar energy as @entity229 , generates 12 percent of its electricity from renewables , and has created a quarter of a million jobs in the sector			1
we 're a long way from a future where the @entity187 becomes the world 's largest source of renewable electricity , and the @entity155 is covered in mirrors lighting and powering cities across the continent			0
there are many huge issues yet to resolve , but with small steps , we may be moving towards it .			0

concentrated solar power projects in @entity4 leading field in that form of green energy
potential of @entity8 in desert regions around the globe ; more benefits than power
plans to transform @entity310 ha would involve huge costs ; small projects breaking through
