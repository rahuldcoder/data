-- @entity2 's passion for military airplanes flows through his veins , passed down from his father 's stories of piloting @entity8 b - 17s in @entity9 these days , @entity2 restores those planes and , in doing so , rekindles a connection with his father			1
restoration is a complicated and expensive process -- @entity2 worked on one plane for five years -- but he says the payoff is worth it			1
" as a kid , you look at war more romantically			0
it 's good versus bad , like cops and robbers , " he said			0
" but as you get older and you realize what they physically had to go through , the hardships , it changes your perspective			0
" so when he learned a restored @entity29 known as the @entity30 was consumed by fire after making an emergency landing in an @entity34 cornfield monday , @entity2 felt as though he had lost a family member			1
the seven people aboard the @entity30 escaped with minor injuries but the plane , which cost more than $ 3 million to restore , was reduced to a charred shell as firefighters struggled to put out the fire			1
the passengers aboard were all members of the @entity43 , which owned the plane			1
the @entity45 toured the country offering paid flights to @entity9 veterans and aviation enthusiasts			1
" the @entity30 was the first b - 17 that i got to ride on , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's a huge loss			0
" though the plane had been grounded for maintenance issues over the weekend , it was cleared for flight on monday			1
investigators with the @entity57 said an inspection will be carried out to determine the cause of the fire			0
" from what i can tell from the pictures , the pilot made a spectacular landing , " @entity2 said			1
" he got the landing gear down and found the best field possible			0
if they had crash - landed it , no one would 've gotten out of the plane			1
" he said he vividly recalls looking at the massive @entity29 with wide - eyed wonder on a family trip to the @entity74 air force museum			1
@entity2 , then 4 years old , crawled through the shiny aluminum plane out the back door and into his father 's arms			1
" this is the plane i flew in the war , " his father told him			1
growing up , @entity2 heard people call his dad a " gifted " pilot			1
he knew he 'd flown what was dubbed the @entity29 during the war			2
but @entity2 said never thought of lt. @entity87 as much more than dad -- until he was much older			1
as history laid bare the harsh realities of @entity9 , @entity2 said , he decided to record his father 's experiences			1
" i decided to interview him because i started to realize he was one of the heroes that they made movies about , " he said			0
" during the time he was flying , he had a one in four chance of finishing a mission alive			0
lt. @entity2 was assigned to the @entity100 ( @entity101 ) of the 8th @entity102 at the height of the war			1
during one of his early missions , he and six other airmen bailed out of their plane over the @entity109 after it became apparent that their bullet - riddled bomber would n't make it back to @entity112			1
they were rescued by an @entity112 fisherman			0
@entity2 was also one of the 43 wounded airmen to return from an air strike on a @entity117 ball bearing company during what military historians christened " @entity121			1
" the @entity102 lost 600 men and 60 planes over enemy territory that day , according to the @entity125			0
more than 60 years after the end of @entity9 , @entity2 refurbishes military airplanes in honor of his father			1
as a volunteer member in the @entity131 of the @entity132 , @entity2 worked for five years to restore a @entity29 known as the @entity133 to flying condition			1
since 1967 , @entity132 has spent more than $ 1.1 million to restore @entity133 to flying condition , in accordance with @entity137 specifications			0
the most recent restoration work on the plane was completed in october 2009			2
@entity2 described the @entity133 ' first flight after that as nerve - wracking because he knew the plane had n't left the ground in seven years			1
" it was definitely an adrenaline rush to take off and know that it was finally flyable , " he said			0
" it was an even happier moment when we landed and knew we could go back up again			0
" after monday 's crash , both of the @entity131 's b - 17s were grounded as a precaution and will undergo inspection of their fuel systems			2
retired naval pilot @entity154 called the loss of the @entity45 devastating because the plane was in pristine condition			2
during @entity9 , he said , 12,371 b - 17s were built			1
as of monday , only 14 flight - worthy planes were left			2
" we now have one less , " he said			0
after retiring from years as a commercial airline captain , @entity154 began volunteering as a military historian at the @entity164 in @entity165 , @entity166			2
he lamented not only the loss of a historic artifact , but also the @entity43 's loss of a major investment			0
" in 1944 , the cost per delivery of a @entity29 was $ 204,370			2
if you multiply that figure by the 12,000 that were delivered you can start to see that the cost of war was very expensive even back then			0
" @entity178 , spokeswoman for the @entity131 , noted that most of the @entity29 's parts are no longer manufactured			2
" when you restore a part that is broken or cracked and corroded , you have to create a part that is no longer produced , " she said			0
the process , called " forgery , " can take years of scouring the globe for a company willing to recreate a single part			0
generating all the materials necessary to completely restore a plane can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars			2
but @entity178 said the driving force behind all of the hard work and money lies within the volunteers			0
" there is a passion many of us have in seeing the past being given life again through the restoration , " she said			0
and in seeing families , like the prices , brought back together again			0
" there are so few @entity9 veterans living today , and when we reintroduce this aircraft with those veterans , it brings tears and old memories back into perspective , " @entity178 said			2
" that makes it very worthwhile for the volunteers who restore these planes			0
" @entity9 service members were always recognized for their contributions to freedom , @entity2 said			1
but when @entity218 made the military unpopular , his father stopped telling stories			2
" i asked him if i could record some of his stories and he was amazed and touched because he thought no one would care about what he 'd done , " he said			0
" it took a while for people to figure out that their fathers , uncles and brothers did heroic deeds worth being thankful for			0
" the @entity9 generation is often remembered as this nation 's greatest war generation but @entity2 said it 's important to not to forget the men and women in uniform who are still sacrificing for @entity238			1
" part of the hope is that by keeping the history alive and maintaining records of what it took to overcome a totalitarian dictator , we wo n't make some of the same mistakes we did before , " he said			0
" learning more and more from my dad and about him made a world of difference in my world view			0
i became proud of my country and my father			2
