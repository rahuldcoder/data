-- community activist @entity1 is on a mission to right the wrongs of his father 's past			1
known as " @entity6 , " @entity1 recalls having a " quintessential " childhood , often envied by his neighborhood friends			1
in his household , his parent 's love and money were free - flowing			1
he and his father planned lavish shopping trips and the family frequently vacationed in @entity16 and @entity17			1
they went to see @entity19 in concert , attended the @entity21 and took in championship boxing matches			1
he describes this time in his life as an inner city version of the 1980s sitcom " @entity26			1
" " my father would pick me up in a @entity28 one day , a @entity29 the next day , a @entity30 the next			2
my mother would drive a @entity29 , a @entity33 , " @entity1 says , " it was normal to me			1
" that all changed on december 6 , 1989			2
that 's the day his father , @entity36 was convicted of helping to run one of the largest drug rings in the history of the nation 's capitol			1
in the same city where his cocaine operation wreaked havoc , his son now mentors young men who might be lured into a life of crime			1
although as a child he knew his father was different from the parents of his @entity52 schoolmates , @entity6 says he was completely unaware of father 's illegal activity			1
" i never saw my dad with drugs at all			2
that was something that was never done in our presence			2
" it was n't until 1988 , when @entity6 was 8 years old that he realized the truth behind his father 's extravagant lifestyle			2
while watching the local news , @entity6 saw a report that claimed officials had raided one of the city 's largest cocaine distribution networks			2
he gazed at the tv screen as his father was escorted into police custody , a suspect in the high profile case			2
after @entity75 was arrested , he never came home			1
" when my father went to prison , my childhood pretty much ended , " he says			1
" my innocence was taken			2
" the court found that @entity36 was a partner in a cocaine distribution conspiracy that generated millions of dollars in sales			2
he is appealing his conviction on four counts including conspiracy to distribute narcotics and racketeering			2
@entity6 's father was eventually sentenced to life without parole			1
@entity36 remembers seeing @entity6 after his guilty verdict			2
... i told him that he had to be strong			2
" leaving his son was the hardest thing he ever had to do			1
" no amount of money i made is worth this , " he says			2
@entity1 says he did n't find out his father would never get out of jail until he was 14 years old , while researching on the internet at school			1
" to find out he was going to be locked up forever was very tough to deal with , " @entity6 says			2
" in a recent interview with @entity0 from a federal prison in @entity106 , @entity36 told @entity0 that it was never his dream to be a drug dealer			1
as the son of a single mother raising six kids on welfare , @entity36 says he started selling drugs at 14 as a way to make ends meet : " we never had enough to eat			1
i actually started selling drugs to ... provide for my siblings			2
" after his dad 's downfall , @entity6 says he went from " riches to rags			2
" along with his mother , @entity6 moved into his grandmother 's row home , located on a city block once known for violence and crime			0
" i had to mature very quickly to be able to kind of survive the things that i went through , " @entity6 says			0
growing up on @entity130 's @entity129 in the late ' 80s and ' 90s , where drugs and violence were commonplace , @entity6 recalls losing friends and family members to the streets			1
shortly after his father 's incarceration , @entity6 says his mother suffered a mental breakdown , leaving him without the secure family structure he once knew			1
" he was left pretty much parentless , " his father says			0
during his teen years , @entity6 admits he was tempted to follow in his father 's footsteps : " the men in my family were bank robbers , and gamblers ... and drug dealers			1
there was no blueprint for me to succeed			0
" but , he credits his mother and grandmother , and his father 's consistent support from behind bars for motivating him to succeed beyond his circumstances			0
" i did n't want to die at 16 , 18 , 21 , " @entity156 says			0
" i knew another way of life was possible			1
" @entity6 graduated from the @entity159 in 2003 at the age of 23			0
now 32 , @entity6 's goal is to impact the lives of young men growing up without fathers			0
in 2010 , @entity6 founded a mentoring initiative for children of incarcerated parents called @entity168			1
he was inspired to create the organization during a routine prison visit with his father			1
@entity6 noticed a young boy waiting in the visiting area to see his dad			0
he looked to be about 8 years old , the same age as @entity6 when his father went away			0
" i completely saw myself in that kid , " he says			0
" i prayed he would n't have to endure what i endured without my father -- that was the premise for @entity168			0
... i wanted to help some kids in my situation make it			0
" @entity6 , whose day job involves developing job skills for ex-offenders , mentors 10 young men ages 9 to 21 through his program			1
he organizes field trips to the @entity189 , sporting events , and dinners			0
he aims to expose the young men to possibility and opportunity			0
@entity6 also helps families buy @entity196 and birthday gifts and school supplies , stepping in where their fathers ca n't			0
in collaboration with his father , who is still in prison in @entity106 , @entity6 has also organized family prison trips for children in need of transportation to detention centers			1
@entity6 is like a big brother to @entity168 participants @entity208 and @entity210			0
" he goes to our football events , basketball games , " says 14 - year - old @entity210			0
" it makes me feel like actually cares			0
" his brother @entity208 , 13 , added : " he can relate to me because he 's been through the same thing i 'm going through			0
" according to the boys ' mother , who asked that her name not be published , @entity6 's presence has made a big difference in her sons ' lives			0
" i see the way my kids ' faces light up just because he can relate , " she explained			0
" most of their peers did n't understand			0
just the average peer group did n't work well for them			0
" according to @entity235 , professor of human development at @entity236 and author of " @entity238 , " children of incarcerated parents are unique when compared with those who have endured other forms of parent separation such as divorce or death			1
research suggests that children of incarcerated parents are often disadvantaged in many areas of life and at a higher risk of school failure , poor self esteem , delinquent behavior and incarceration themselves , according to @entity235			1
it 's difficult for the remaining parent to find coping resources for children living with the stress of having a parent behind bars , she says , adding that programs like @entity168 can be effective			1
" insider status is very important , " she says			0
" therapy that is typically successful for children of incarcerated parents are programs that closely model their day to day experience			1
" for @entity6 , leading by example is the best way to inspire others around him			0
though he ca n't turn back the clock , he 's trying to restore his father 's name in the community			0
" one of the biggest things i 'm proud of is that i 've been able to really change the perception of what my name means in my city			1
" today , @entity6 still lives in the same row house with his grandmother , on the same street where he grew up			0
" the kids in my community need to see me , " @entity6 says			0
" they need to be able to touch me and know that i am not a myth			0
i want to be an inspiration for them to say yes we can make it out too			0
