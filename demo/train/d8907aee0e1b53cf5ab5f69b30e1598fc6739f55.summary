-- a month after the @entity3 ferry sank , leaving 284 people dead and 20 missing , the incident set off a bout of national soul searching in @entity8 over what went wrong			1
much of the blame has fallen on the ferry 's crew , who scrambled to safety while the passengers were told repeatedly to stay put			1
four of them have been charged with murder , prosecutors told @entity0 thursday			1
the company 's ceo has also been charged with " causing death by negligence , as well as causing the capsizing of the ship in the line of duty			1
" beyond the ferry 's owners and crew , the sinking has spurred a debate about governmental oversight and what preventive measures could 've been taken			1
the @entity8 president , @entity33 , said in a speech on april 21 : " this accident is highlighting many problems			1
first , the ship 's introduction ( how it came into the country ) , inspections , operational permits must be examined			0
" the reckoning over the accident has been a bitter one			2
here is a look at some of the suspected factors behind the tragedy : 1			0
@entity8 investigators : @entity3 was overloaded the passenger ferry was carrying more than double the ship 's limit when it capsized , according to @entity8 investigators			1
since @entity55 started the @entity56 to @entity58 route in march 2013 , 57 % of its trips carried excess cargo ( 139 times out of 241 trips ) , according to the prosecutors			0
the company profited from overloading the ferry , earning an extra profit of $ 2.9 million since march 2013 , investigators say			1
too much cargo contributed to sinking , police say 2			0
prosecutors : cargo on the ferry was not properly secured investigators have been probing the possibility the ship overturned because of a sharp turn that may have shifted the cargo , knocking the vessel off balance			2
witnesses have described how several containers fell over and made booming sounds as they tumbled off balance			0
loosely tied goods contributed to the @entity3 's sinking , because the cargo had n't been tied properly , senior prosecutor @entity81 said earlier this month			1
" the lashing devices that should have held cargo goods steady were loose , and some of the crew members did not even know " how to use them correctly , @entity81 said			1
crew insisted passengers stay put " please do not move from your location , " the ferry 's loudspeakers blared at those on board			1
" absolutely do not move			0
" this type of warning was heard repeatedly as the @entity3 began its descent into the water			1
hundreds of passengers , unable to tell what was happening , complied			0
the instruction to remain in place , instead of getting on lifeboats , has been described as " terribly , tragically wrong , " by one @entity0 analyst			0
it 's unclear why the crew made this determination , which remains one of the most haunting and perplexing questions surrounding the incident			2
a transcript of the communication between @entity3 and the local authority shows that the decision was made fairly early			1
at 9:00 a.m. , the @entity117 told an unidentified crew member : " please put on the life vests and get ready as people may have to abandon ship			2
" the @entity3 crew member immediately replied : " it is hard for people to move			1
" during communications with the local traffic services center that lasted until 9:38 a.m. , the unidentified crew member repeatedly asserted that passengers could not reach life rafts or rescue boats because " they ca n't move ... the vessel has listed			2
" ( from transcript ) 4			0
the captain abandoned ship , while passengers were told not to move			2
capt. @entity135 of the @entity3 has come under heavy criticism for abandoning the ship while hundreds of passengers remained on board			1
pictures of the captain in what looks like his underwear hopping into the arms of the rescuer infuriated the nation			2
president @entity33 described the crew 's actions as being " like murder			1
" @entity135 is now facing murder charges			2
he initially defended the decision saying that he had everyone " stand by and wait for the rescue boat to arrive			0
" " the tidal current was strong and water temperature was cold , and there was no rescue boat , " he told reporters last month			2
" so i had everyone stand by and wait for the rescue boat to arrive			0
inexperienced crew member steered the ship			0
authorities have questioned why an inexperienced third mate was guiding the ship at the time of the accident			0
that third mate is also facing charges of not abiding by emergency safety law , negligence which led to the ship sinking and causing injuries leading to deaths			0
the captain was not at helm at the time of the accident			1
there is no law requiring the captain to be on the bridge when the third mate is steering , but that an inexperienced member of the crew was navigating in one of the most treacherous stretches of the trip has raised questions			1
the third mate denied making a sharp turn a few days after the accident and said , " the steering turned much more than usual			0
there are aspects where i made mistakes but for some reason the steering turned so much faster than usual			0
delays on notifying proper authorities of the accident the first distress call came not from the ship 's crew , but instead from a boy on board who used a cell phone to contact emergency services at 8:52 a.m. his call to emergency services gave rescuers a few extra minutes to get to the stricken @entity3 as it is listed dangerously before capsizing			1
three minutes later , the ship 's crew made a distress to authorities in @entity58 -- which was the ship 's destination rather than near its accident site			1
the miscommunication may have caused delays			0
ship 's modifications raise questions the @entity3 had been renovated in 2013 to expand the top floor to make room for more passengers			2
the 20 - year - old ship was originally used in @entity218 , until @entity219 purchased the ferry in 2012 and refurbished it			0
@entity221 added extra passenger cabins on the third , fourth and fifth decks , raising passenger capacity and altering the weight and balance of the vessel			0
investigators want to know if the renovations may have made the ferry more likely to capsize or raised the ship 's center of gravity			0
the @entity232 announced in late april that it would ask lawmakers to consider legislation prohibiting modifications to ships to increase passenger capacity			0
the government plans to take away the company 's licenses for all its routes , including the one on which the @entity3 sank , according to an official at the ministry			1
@entity0 's @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity250 - eun @entity249 , @entity251 and @entity252 contributed to this report .			0
