-- in the world according to @entity7 , @entity2 leader @entity1 , whom he just saw on his second trip to the country , is quite likable			1
" he has to do his job , but he 's a very good guy , " @entity7 said monday at a news conference , announcing plans for a " basketball diplomacy " event that will involve players from @entity2			1
meanwhile , @entity1 presides over one of the most repressive regimes on @entity16			1
as @entity20 puts it , @entity1 's succession as supreme leader after the death of his father , @entity24 , in december 2011 , " had little impact on the country 's dire human rights record			1
" people are subjected to torture and thrown into prison camps based on political charges			0
those who have managed to escape describe horror that includes beatings , starvation and executions			0
as @entity0 has reported , @entity1 appears to have changed nothing in the camps			1
@entity36 citizen @entity35 knows first - hand			0
he 's currently in one , charged with " serious crimes " and sentenced to 15 years of hard labor for allegedly trying to bring down the government through religious activities			2
@entity35 's family says he owned a tour company and was in @entity2 for work			1
the accusations against him were spelled out on state - run media , which is the only kind of media that " very good guy " @entity1 and his country allow			1
bae from @entity2 prison : please help me par for the course in @entity2 , where people have no freedom			1

" the government made no known attempts to prosecute officials who committed human rights abuses			2
" meanwhile , much of the country starves			0
more than 25 % of @entity2 children under the age of 5 suffered from chronic malnutrition in 2012 , according to the @entity87 of @entity2 , a report backed by @entity89 , the @entity90 and the @entity91			1
the report also found nearly one in three women suffered from anemia			0
the @entity2 we rarely see @entity7 : come with me in the world according to @entity7 , journalists would realize that his rosy description of @entity1 is really the right one , if only they 'd go over there and see for themselves			1
" you write what you hear , but you do n't see what you write , " @entity7 complained , saying he wants to bring a journalist on one of his trips to visit his friend			1
yes , that 's the problem , mr. @entity7			1
@entity2 is aching for journalists to roam freely around the country and report to the world what things are really like			1
" my military minder tells me to turn my camera off , and it soon becomes clear why , " @entity0 's @entity116 wrote last month on a trip to the " hermit kingdom			0
" " the poverty i see through the bus window is not the view of @entity2 the regime wants to be seen			2
... buildings are in disrepair ; some barely look inhabitable			0
residents of this small town walk or sit by the side of the road , many seeming to have little to do			0
a number of official - looking men dressed in brown @entity133 suits stand silently on street corners			0
... despite the driver traveling as quickly as possible through these inhabited areas , you could still sense the local community being monitored			0
" " it was a tightly restricted , carefully stage - managed tour rich with propaganda and political theater and little else , " @entity0 's @entity139 wrote in july of his five - day trip to @entity141			2
" it offered virtually no insight into what life is like for ordinary citizens who live in this rigid dictatorship			0
" " we were not allowed to leave the confines of the @entity153 unless we were riding a government bus			0
during my five days in @entity2 , the authorities did not even allow me to see what the country 's currency looks like			1
" " our three - man crew was assigned two very polite minders who accompanied us everywhere outside of the hotel and made no secret about the fact that they had veto rights if we were to take pictures of something that they did n't approve of , " he added on @entity0 's @entity162 blog			2
" so they would basically tell us what we could and could not take pictures of			0
" @entity7 : @entity1 just wants to talk in the world according to @entity7 , @entity1 just wants to talk			1
" it 's about trying to open @entity178 's and everyone 's minds , " he said monday , aiming some of his remarks at the @entity36 president			0
" you do n't have to talk about politics			0
... meet him or even give him a call			0
that 's all he wants			0
" meanwhile , @entity1 might be even more bellicose than his father was			2
on @entity0 's @entity162 blog , three analysts say an analysis of language used in the state - controlled @entity200 " shows the use of terms such as ' war ' and ' nuclear ' far more prevalent than terms such as ' peace ' and ' reconciliation			0
' " a @entity36 defense official said @entity2 has been using " warmongering rhetoric			2
" @entity7 : i held @entity1 's daughter in the world according to @entity7 , @entity1 opening " his heart and mind " and allowing @entity7 to hold his daughter " for the first time in history " is something to celebrate			1
never mind that the existence of said child has been shrouded in secrecy			0
@entity2 's regime is so restrictive that even state media have n't mentioned the possibility that their leader might have had a daughter			1
and speaking of children , @entity7 shared an interesting detail monday involving the " basketball diplomacy " event he 's putting together with @entity225 , an online betting company			1
" the marshall " -- the term @entity1 goes by -- " gave me anything i wanted , " he said			2
@entity1 told him , " we 've got 150,000 kids will do anything for you on the field			2
we 've got 95,000 people will be in the stadium watching this game			0
" a dictator telling a foreign basketball player he can instruct 150,000 kids , who will comply : in the world according to @entity7 , that 's a good thing			1
still , reason for hope any effort to , as @entity7 says , " bridge a gap " with @entity2 can be construed as a good thing			1
" i said to him , ' your grandfather and your father did some bad things ... but you are trying to change , ' " @entity7 said at monday 's news conference			1
@entity1 has an " image " to keep up , he added			2
maybe , one day , @entity1 will knock down the walls behind which his country tries to hide its reality -- including the desperation , pain and horror described by defectors and refugees			2
struggling for survival , family tries to feed child mice but for now , @entity1 's propaganda machine is ratcheting up , as @entity0 has reported			1
@entity7 says @entity1 asked him to do one thing : " tell the @entity36 people we 're very cool			1
" @entity269 accomplished , mr. @entity7 .			2

@entity7 calls @entity2 dictator @entity1 " a very good guy "
@entity20 says @entity1 has had little effect on @entity2 's dismal rights record
@entity7 calls on journalists to visit @entity2 and see for themselves
