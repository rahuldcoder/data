while the @entity3 economy surges in 2014 , posting the biggest jobs numbers in 15 years , the @entity1 economy is tanking straight into a recession after a bludgeon of @entity8 sanctions			1
but the economic news has n't translated to presidential approval ratings -- in either country			0
president @entity12 has been facing some of his lowest job approval numbers this year while public support in @entity1 for president @entity15 has surged over the last year to record highs			1
@entity15 's numbers are n't just high ; they 've surged from a 61 % low in nov. 2013 as events in @entity19 unfolded and despite sanctions hitting the country			0
and as opposed to @entity3 , a majority of @entity1 think their country is on the right track			1
a majority of @entity3 , 53 % according to a @entity27 poll released last week , disapprove of @entity12 while 85 % of @entity1 approve of @entity15 , according to a november poll from the highly cited @entity29 , an independent polling agency			1
@entity12 's struggling popularity had a concrete impact in november when his party suffered a drubbing at the polls on @entity35 , despite low gas prices and the lowest unemployment numbers of his presidency			0
meanwhile , the @entity1 government admitted this week the country should brace recession because of dramatic drops in oil prices and after a spree of @entity8 sanctions over @entity1 's annexation of @entity47 and its ongoing support for separatists in eastern @entity19 walloped the @entity1 currency and sent investors fleeing			0
@entity15 has remained defiant in the face of @entity8 sanctions and political pressure to stand down in @entity19			0
and that defiance is earning him political points at home despite the impact on the @entity1 economy			1
on thursday @entity15 delivered a rallying state of the nation address in which he accused the @entity8 of replicating the @entity62 containment strategy -- asserting that @entity8 nations would have found a way to impose sanctions on @entity1 even without the crisis roiling in @entity19 -- and he called on @entity1 at home and abroad to come together			1
speaking to top business leaders wednesday , @entity12 appeared keenly aware of @entity15 's success in stirring nationalist sentiment to beat back the force international sanctions			1
" if you ask me if i am optimistic that @entity15 suddenly changes his mindset , i do n't think that will happen until the politics inside of @entity1 catch up to what 's happening with the economy in @entity1 , which is part of the reason why we 're going to maintain that pressure , " @entity12 said , according to the @entity73			1
but the political landscape @entity12 and @entity15 face could n't be more different			2
@entity1 state media pumps out high levels of propaganda straight from the @entity90 , dissenting voices are censured and political dissenters are jailed			0
@entity92 , author of " @entity93 : how @entity97 , " said those factors make it more difficult to gauge @entity1 public opinion			0
" the very idea that people know about an alternative to @entity15 the way @entity3 know about an alternative to @entity12 like the @entity103 is just laughable , " @entity92 said			1
@entity92 acknowledged that there was an " outburst of nationalist hysteria " after @entity1 annexed @entity47 , but said he believes @entity8 sanctions are driving down public opinion of the @entity1 leader as the economy takes a hit			2
@entity112 , an international affairs professor at the @entity113 specializing in @entity1 politics , said on the whole , the polls reflect the reality on the ground of popular support for @entity15			1
" i do n't think @entity1 are really hiding their feelings , " @entity112 said , adding that the polls indicate support for @entity15 , but not necessarily the depth of that support			2
media propaganda plays a key role in bolstering @entity15 's popularity , @entity112 said , especially in the portrayal of @entity19 's popular revolt as a fascist takeover and in portraying the annexation of @entity47 as , essentially , a rescue mission			2
while @entity1 have " rallied around the leader " in the face of @entity8 sanctions , over time the economic impact of those sanctions could ultimately backfire on @entity15			2
" over time people are going to say , ' yeah ok we 're happy with @entity1 being larger and its newfound role on the political stage			0
we 're glad we have a leader standing up for us , but we also want a better economy , " @entity112 said			0
so while the media does boost @entity15 's public image through ha " barrage of positive images of him , " economic realities will in the long term hit @entity15 , adding that @entity15 's strategy of blaming the @entity8 for hits to the economy is limited			2
" after a while that starts to wear off , " @entity112 said			0
but that could take years , he said .			0

the @entity3 economy is *roaring* and the @entity1 economy is *sagging*
president @entity12 is in an approval slump , but @entity15 is seeing a popular surge
