the financially - stricken side , who became the first - ever @entity10 club to enter administration earlier this year , would have been gauranteed a place in @entity13 next season because their final opponents , @entity15 , have secured a @entity18 place			1
however , @entity4 's administrators -- who revealed on wednesday that the club is in debt to the tune of $ 170m -- have been told that any late application for a @entity13 club licence will not be considered due to the club 's on - going financial problems			1
a joint statement from the @entity1 and @entity10 said : " the @entity1 and @entity10 have confirmed to the administrators of @entity4 that they shall not consider any late application for granting of a @entity13 @entity31 for the 2010 - 11 season			2
" the decision means the team who finish seventh in the @entity10 , with @entity36 currently in that position , will take @entity4 's place			0
@entity41 football 's governing body @entity13 had earlier revealed that the club could submit a late application before may 31 -- but the @entity10 and @entity1 have subsequently decreed that the @entity4 's financial situation is so bad that they would not meet any of @entity13 's criteria to enter			1
@entity4 's administrator @entity46 told @entity47 : " we have spent a long time going through all the necessary steps and we had hoped to make a @entity41 application next week			0
" we felt that we would do our bit and that it would be up to the @entity1 and the @entity10 to do theirs			0
it 's wrong for the fans that they should not be allowed to support their club in @entity13 next season			0

@entity3 finalists @entity4 will not be allowed to play in next season 's @entity5
@entity4 were guaranteed a place in @entity13 because @entity15 will be in @entity18
but the @entity1 have *vetoed* this because of the club 's financial crisis
