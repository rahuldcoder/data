@entity0 -- aboard the @entity6 , the sound of the ship 's five - story high engine permeates like a heartbeat through the four - football field length of ship			1
chief officer @entity10 talks to @entity1 's @entity11 as night falls on the bridge of the @entity13			1
it 's also the heartbeat of the world economy , as the @entity6 takes its thousands of containers filled with shoes , computers , furniture and fireworks from @entity21 to markets in @entity23			1
but a more telling sight is when the massive vessel nears @entity26 and passes by dozens of idle ships			1

piracy has been making the news in recent months , exacerbating economic concerns of the financial crisis			0
