@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 vowed wednesday to focus his energy for the rest of his presidency on the core tenet of his election victories -- equal opportunity for all @entity10 -- starting with campaign - style speeches on the economy that appeared to launch this year 's budget battle with @entity14			1
confronting the deep partisan divide over federal spending , tax reform and raising the debt ceiling later this year , @entity3 told a large crowd at the @entity20 in @entity21 that reversing a growing inequality between haves and have - nots should be the top priority of @entity25			1
he chastised @entity25 for inaction and vowed to take matters into his own hands during the remaining 1,276 days he has in office			2
" where i can act on my own , i 'm going to			0
i 'm not going to wait for @entity25 , " he said in the second of two speeches that kicked off a series of economic - themed addresses across the country			0
it was a sentiment he expressed earlier in the day during a speech to hundreds at @entity38 in @entity0 , @entity1			0
" this growing inequality is n't just morally wrong ; it 's bad economics , " @entity3 said			2
during the speech at @entity38 , he blended populist imagery from his campaign stump speech last year with the criticism of conservative @entity14 who , according to the president , only stood for repealing his signature 2010 health care reform law and slashing federal spending in an effort to shrink government			1
" repealing obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan			0
it 's not , " @entity3 said , challenging the political right to work with him on budget and tax polices that promote economic fairness for all , especially the middle class and people aspiring to join it			1
gearing up for health care exchanges : crunch time for @entity52 his voice rising , @entity3 declared that " the one thing i care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term to make this country work for working @entity10 again			1
" as the audience stood to applaud and cheer , he added : " that 's all i care about			0
i do n't have another election			0
" earlier wednesday , @entity72 spokesman @entity71 acknowledged to @entity2 that a goal of @entity3 's speeches was to ratchet up pressure on republicans to work with @entity77 and the president , noting that " in the end , members of @entity25 respond to their constituents			1
" republicans called @entity3 's speeches a retread strategy that lacked fresh ideas to further bolster an economy that everyone agrees should be growing faster			1
" we 've heard most of it before , " @entity14 sen. @entity87 of @entity88 told @entity2 , adding that @entity3 's economic policies had failed			1
" he 's a good politician , " @entity87 said of @entity3 , noting that the president was telling people what they wanted to hear			1
" but he 's not doing what he needs to do to create good jobs			0
" despite slow but steady growth over the past four years , polls show many @entity10 are still concerned about unemployment and the economy overall even though indicators show an improving recovery and @entity102 is again in record territory			0
two new surveys on wednesday indicated less than half of @entity10 approve of the president 's handling of the economy			0
both polls , by @entity110 / @entity109 and @entity112 / @entity111 , found more respondents disapprove of how @entity3 has dealt with the economy , which remained the top issue for the public			2
the first six months of @entity3 's second term have been dominated by issues like gun violence and immigration reform , with legislation on both currently mired in partisan wrangling , as well as controversies such as @entity125 targeting of groups seeking tax - exempt status			1
reframing political debate his speeches wednesday sought to reframe the political debate as the government approaches the end of its fiscal year on september 30 and a potential shutdown if @entity25 fails to overcome the gridlock that has become its trademark			1
@entity38 is where @entity3 delivered his first major economic address of his national political career eight years ago , and he used the setting to emphasize progress made since then in overcoming the recession his administration inherited to launch a slow but steady economic recovery			1
at the same time , @entity3 said the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century demanded new thinking and policies to capitalize on @entity10 's potential and end the pattern of worsening inequality from previous decades			2
he called for @entity149 to focus on " rebuilding our manufacturing base , educating our workforce , upgrading our transportation systems , upgrading our information networks " instead of what he labeled " an endless parade of distractions , political posturing and phony scandals			0
" @entity3 was particularly tough on conservative @entity160 , whom he blamed for blocking progress on issues such as immigration reform agreed to by their @entity14 colleagues in the @entity166			1
he said he would work with anyone with good ideas while using executive authority and calling on on business leaders , philanthropists , labor leaders -- " anybody who can help " -- to push for economic changes promoting equal opportunity			1
" i will not allow gridlock or inaction or willful indifference to get in our way , " @entity3 said			2
later in the day , @entity3 headed to the @entity20 in @entity21 for another address expected to focus on education			2
looming budget battle regardless of the political focus of recent months , the national debate was certain to focus on the federal budget this summer and fall			1
pitched political battles over spending and taxes have dominated @entity3 's presidency , and @entity14 leaders spurred on by conservative @entity160 facing congressional elections next year are threatening hardline negotiating tactics over the budget and affiliated issues of tax reform and forced spending cuts known as sequestration that took effect this year			1
both the @entity14 - majority @entity72 and @entity77 - majority @entity166 have passed spending proposals for fiscal year 2014 , but the measures bear little resemblance to each other in terms of priorities			2
any attempt to reconcile differences through negotiation faces complications from related issues such as whether the sweeping government spending cuts that took effect in march and hit the military and discretionary accounts hard should continue unchanged			0
another potential landmine is the opposition by conservative @entity160 , including some @entity14 leaders in @entity25 , to funding the implementation of the health care reform law pushed through by @entity77 with @entity3 's backing in 2010			1
further complicating the debate is the certain need for @entity25 to authorize an increase in the government 's borrowing limit , or debt ceiling , sometime this fall			0
' the @entity228 rule ' house speaker @entity228 has made clear that any rise in the debt ceiling would require an equal cut in government spending to get @entity14 support , a demand known as the @entity228 rule as set by the @entity235 @entity14			1
opinion : will speaker @entity228 make history ? the @entity72 has said it will not negotiate on the debt ceiling , and some congressional republicans balk at linking it to specific demands , such as cuts in funds for implementing health care reform , but insist that more must be done to reduce deficits and debt			0
" i think holding the debt limit a hostage to any specific thing is probably not the best negotiating place , " @entity14 sen. @entity247 of @entity248 told @entity249			2
" where we ought to be now is , we need more spending cuts			0
" @entity247 specifically called for reforms to popular entitlement programs such as @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 to reduce their costs " so they last			0
" however , @entity77 and @entity14 remain far apart on entitlements , long a target of conservatives seeking to shrink government , especially programs that they say lead to federal dependence			0
@entity77 argue the government pension program and health care for the elderly and poor are part of a vital social contract that ensures the well - being of vulnerable citizens			0
@entity3 said wednesday that @entity77 must " question old assumptions " and " be willing to redesign or get rid of programs that do n't work as well as they should			2
" he has come under fire from some liberals for already proposing a change in how the annual cost - of - living index for federal benefits gets calculated as part of a broad but so far unreachable deficit reduction deal with @entity14			0
@entity2 's @entity288 contributed to this report , which was reported by @entity290 in @entity0 and written by @entity291 in @entity149			0
