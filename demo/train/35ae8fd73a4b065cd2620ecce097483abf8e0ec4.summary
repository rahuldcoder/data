-- " @entity1 ! trauma alert ! @entity3			1
" the announcement comes through the overhead speakers in an operating room in @entity7 , @entity8 , and a team of doctors and nurses spring into action			2
dr. @entity13 takes the vital signs of the patient who was just rushed in and shouts orders to his team			2
" do we have his blood pressure yet ? " asks @entity13			2
this trauma scene is like the ones @entity13 has been through a lot over the years			1
yet , no matter how many times you do it , he says , you can never quite prepare for what the next emergency may be			2
" we get about 1,200 traumas a year , " he said			2
" i 'm ex-military and did a deployment to @entity30 and @entity31 , and these scenarios were on par with what i would see out there			2
" but today 's trauma alerts were different			1
the patient was bleeding and had rapidly changing vital signs , but he was never in danger of dying -- because he was never alive			2
at a glance it looks just like a mannequin			1
but this is no dummy			2
it is a high tech patient simulator			1
it 's equipped with robotics that allows it to move , hemorrhage and provide vitals for doctors			2
" the mannequin did look very realistic , " @entity13 said			1
" you were able to do a neuro check , move extremities , look at his eyes , and his breathing and respirations were very accurate			0
" the patient simulator is a product of a company called @entity62			1
it was designed to help doctors prepare for trauma cases like war - zone injuries , car crashes , gunshot wounds and amputations			1
but it 's not just about looking real			1
it also provides detailed feedback on the team 's performance			0
" they just performed the chest tube properly , " said @entity75 of @entity62			1
" all of these are indications that the learner has performed the intervention			0
he lost a total of 1,500 millileters of blood and respiratory is back up			0
" @entity75 was controlling the patient simulator from a control room overlooking the operating room			0
from there , a group of doctors monitor the training sessions , keeping the teams on their toes with their ability to change the scenarios at any second			1
" if you think you are doing great , i 'll switch the scenario			0
i 'll drop his blood pressure			0
what are you going to do now , " said dr. @entity104 of the @entity105 and @entity106 , where the training session is taking place			0
the center is a 90,000 - square - foot state - of - the - art health training and education facility			1
it 's designed to help health professionals , students and residents train under pressure			0
" you have a mannequin that has breathing , vocalization and you can do invasive treatments , " said @entity104			1
" that is what changes someone 's mind and says , ' ok , now i 'm really in a situation			0
' you get ultimate learning from that point			0
" never knowing when the next tragedy will strike has hospitals turning to technology like this so teams can learn what an emergency situation could look and feel like			0
" when we do debriefing , we ask them what are you feeling , " @entity104 said			0
" give it one word , and you saw the group say this is difficult , chaotic , intense , someone said scary			0
" one person felt overwhelmed			0
overwhelmed here is fine because now they can go back and know how to deal with that feeling			0
" for @entity13 's team , the lessons learned could turn out to be life - saving			1
today , however , was just a good run - through			1
" the team - building type aspects is what medicine needs to go through , instead of focusing on individual skills , " he said			1
" that will be better for the patient because we 'll have better outcomes			0
" today went exceptionally well , " he added			0
" the mannequin did not die			1

a line of high - tech dummies is used in simulations of trauma *surgery*
the dummies , by @entity62 , bleed , breath and talk
*observers* can change conditions in real time as trainees respond
doctor : on a good day " the mannequin did not die "
