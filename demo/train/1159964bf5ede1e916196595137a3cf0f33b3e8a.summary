@entity0 -- a @entity3 seal team that fought its way upstairs at @entity6 's compound killed him with rapid - fire shots to his chest and forehead , according to a @entity11 official who has seen military reports of the raid			1
the unarmed @entity6 , who the @entity15 said put up some form of resistance , was moving when he was first shot , the official on wednesday told @entity20 correspondent @entity19			1
sen. @entity21 , chairwoman of the @entity22 , told @entity1 that weapons were near @entity6 , who died on an upper floor of the compound toward the end of the nearly 40 - minute raid			1
" he was right there and going to get those arms			0
you really ca n't take a chance			0
" the official who had seen the report -- and other sources -- provided new details on the nighttime operation and @entity6 's gruesome wounds , which were photographed			1
president @entity38 , not wanting to inflame passions or appear to gloat , decided not to release a photo of @entity6 's corpse , the @entity15 said wednesday			1
" there 's a long history of images like that being used to rally opinion against people , to turn people into heroes , " @entity15 press secretary @entity42 said			0
a senior @entity52 official close to the @entity15 told @entity1 that @entity38 was " never in favor " of releasing a photo			2
the photo decision -- following intense debate within the administration and by the public -- came as the @entity11 continued pressing the @entity60 government on how it could not have known the @entity62 leader was living near a military academy in @entity64 when he was killed by @entity11 special forces early monday			1
the seal team is back on @entity11 soil , a senior @entity11 official today @entity1 wednesday night			2
investigators , meanwhile , continued poring over materials gathered at @entity6 's hideout			1
the haul includes 10 hard drives , five computers and more than 100 storage devices , such as disks , dvds and thumb drives , a senior @entity11 official told @entity1			2
the materials might provide clues on @entity62 members and potential plots for future attacks			0
the commandos also recovered five cell phones , audio and video equipment , " lots " of paper documents and some five guns , including @entity90 and pistols , a @entity11 official told @entity1 homeland security correspondent @entity94			1
the objects were " hiding in plain sight , " according to the official , who described the material as a treasure trove of information			2
at a @entity112 hearing wednesday , @entity11 attorney general @entity110 said of evidence taken from the residence , " as we glean information from that material , we will make appropriate decisions with regard to who might we add to the terrorist watch list , the no - fly list , all those things			0
" a @entity11 official told @entity1 in the afternoon that no names have been added to the watch list			2
it appeared @entity6 had contingency plans while he stayed at the fenced compound			1
@entity6 had 500 euros ( about $ 745 ) in cash and two telephone numbers sewn into his clothing when he was killed , a congressional source present at a classified briefing on the operation tuesday told @entity1 wednesday			1
photos taken shortly after the raid show three men lying dead in pools of blood and the wreckage of a @entity11 helicopter abandoned during the assault			1
one of the dead men bears a family resemblance to @entity6 , but there was no confirmation of his identity			1
the @entity62 leader 's adult son was among those killed in monday 's attack by @entity11 commandos , according to @entity11 officials			0
the pictures were published wednesday by @entity146			1
the news agency says they were taken by a @entity60 security official about an hour after @entity11 forces left @entity6 's compound and that it is confident of the authenticity of the purchased images			1
the commandos took @entity6 's body with them , @entity11 officials have said			2
cia director @entity157 and @entity42 on tuesday said the commandos fought their way up to the third floor of the compound , moving room to room			0
@entity6 and his family lived on the second and third floors , @entity42 said			2
the @entity11 official who described @entity6 's last moments said the @entity62 leader was " moving " at the time he was initially shot			1
the official declined to describe those movements			0
previously , another @entity11 official said @entity6 was shot when he made a threatening move			1
when asked if @entity6 tried to grab a weapon or physically attack a commando , the official would only say , " he did n't hold up his hands and surrender			1
" the first shot hit @entity6 in the chest and the second struck him in the forehead just above the left eye , the official told @entity1			1
a photo shows a gunshot wound to the head above the left eye , with the skull partially blown away , according to two sources who have seen a photograph of @entity6 's body			2
seal teams are trained , if at all possible , to take the first " hit to kill " shot by aiming dead center between the eyes , and then with a chest shot , according to a military officer familiar with their tactics and techniques			0
if @entity6 was moving , that first shot might not have been possible			1
the shots occurred so rapidly they were nearly simultaneous			0
one of @entity6 's daughters has told @entity60 interrogators that she saw her father shot , a senior @entity60 intelligence source said wednesday			1
the daughter , believed to be 12 or 13 years old , was among those left behind at the compound after monday 's @entity11 raid , the source said			0
@entity11 officials said @entity6 's wife was in the room with him and rushed at @entity11 special operations forces , who then shot her in the leg			1
the @entity60 intelligence source told @entity1 wednesday that four men at the compound were killed in addition to @entity220 's son , two men who were brothers , and an unknown man			1
that conflicts with information provided by the @entity15 , which said tuesday that three men and one woman were killed in the operation , in addition to @entity6			2
because @entity6 was killed and buried at sea , the administration has been under some pressure to release a photo proving he was dead			2
the president noted that few credible people have questioned the death and that conspiracy theorists would not be satisfied with a photo , the senior @entity52 official said			0
that position was supported by defense secretary @entity241 and secretary of state @entity242 , the @entity52 official said			0
" we do n't trot out this stuff as trophies , " @entity42 quoted @entity38 as saying in an interview earlier wednesday with the @entity244 " 60 minutes			0
" " this is somebody who was deserving of the justice he received , " @entity38 said in the interview			0
" but we do n't need to spike the football			0
" sen. @entity254 , @entity256 - @entity255 , called @entity38 's decision a " mistake			0
" " i know @entity6 is dead			2
but the best way to protect and defend our interests overseas is to prove that fact to the rest of the world , " he said in a written statement			0
questions are mounting , meanwhile , about why @entity60 failed to locate or bring @entity6 to justice			1
according to two sources at a briefing tuesday , @entity157 told lawmakers that @entity60 officials either " were involved or incompetent			2
neither place is a good place to be			0
" the @entity11 is asking @entity60 for information on who built and owned the compound where @entity6 lived , two senior @entity11 officials said wednesday			1
@entity60 government officials have insisted that they did not know @entity6 's whereabouts			1
" what worse statement can come than that we heard from @entity157 ? " a senior @entity60 intelligence official said			1
" i am afraid this statement is totally regrettable			0
( @entity157 ) of all people knows how much we have been doing			0
" the official , who did not want to be named , said his country had been generously sharing intelligence with its @entity11 counterparts			0
@entity288 , @entity60 's ambassador to the @entity11 , said his government will conduct an inquiry to find out how @entity6 managed to maintain residency there			1
the government was not complicit with @entity6 because having him there was harmful , @entity288 told @entity296 ' @entity295			2
any official who was aware of the fugitive 's presence and failed to act will be held accountable , he added			0
@entity38 , meanwhile , planned a visit thursday to @entity302 's ground zero where the twin towers of the @entity304 once stood			0
the towers fell in september 11 , 2001 , when @entity62 hijackers flew commercial planes into them			0
@entity38 will take part in a wreath - laying ceremony and will meet with families of victims and first responders , but will not make remarks , @entity15 spokesman @entity42 said			0
he characterized the event as " bittersweet			0
" @entity1 's @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity94 , @entity322 , @entity19 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 and @entity329 contributed to this report .			0
