the revolution will not be televised but it will be tweeted , instant messaged or , in the case of @entity3 , broadcast on mesh networks like @entity5			1
@entity5 -- an ' off - the - grid ' smartphone app -- emerged this month as the technological glue holding @entity3 's pro-democracy protests together and a powerful weapon in the hands of mass movements , dissidents and protesters			1
the app works by creating its own network outside the internet , relying simply on the bluetooth or @entity20 link that exist between one phone and another			1
unlike mobile and internet networks which come under strain and break down the more users tax the system , the more people in a mesh network like @entity5 , the better it works			1
" we were pretty much forced to use it almost at the start of the protests because there were just so many people in the protest areas , it made the cell network so slow , " said @entity30 , an ' @entity31 ' pro-democracy activist			2
" @entity5 does n't need data to work -- a lot of people were downloading it			1
" the company that developed the application , @entity46 , initially struggled to keep up with its new - found popularity , adding more capacity as news of the app spread from @entity3 to rest of the world			1
unexpected success for a start - up that only launched in march this year , the numbers were staggering			2
in the first two weeks of the protests , between september 27 and october 10 , the service registered 500,000 downloads in @entity3 alone ( 61 % on @entity58 and 39 % on @entity59 ) , 10.2 million chat sessions and 1.6 million chatrooms			1
" we were not expecting this and we were very surprised , " @entity5 marketing chief @entity62 told @entity63			1
" we saw this enormous surge in our service and realized something really big was happening			0
" now we 've seen spikes just about everywhere in the world and there may be two reasons for this			0
the first is that there are some people who use it to get the latest information about what 's happening in @entity3 and the second are people who just want to see what the fuss is all about			2
" @entity84 language users , in particular , have taken to the app , expressing support for the movement from as far away as @entity88 and the @entity89			2
with the buzz now dying down , @entity62 said that the volume of downloads was tailing off but activity is trending up and the chat sessions have got shorter as people keep communications focused on important information			0
" what that says to us is that quite a few people are sticking with it , " @entity62 said			0
' @entity104 megaphone ' unlike other messaging applications , @entity5 is not limited to a user 's circle			1
what goes up on @entity109 is available for everybody to see			0
" it 's like a giant megaphone , " he said			0
" you could be in a place and shout i 'm in this precise location and we need water bottles right now and someone whom you do n't know can answer that message come with those bottles			0
" that would be harder to do with @entity124 or @entity125 where you 're limited by the people you know as far as the reach of your communication is concerned			0
" the co-founder and ceo of @entity132 happened to be in @entity3 on a layover when the protests started and extended his stay to get live feedback on the service			2
authentic voices one thing that protesters complained about was that everyone could read the traffic , including opponents of the @entity144			0
since then @entity5 has added a verification component that stamps the messages as coming from a particular user or group			2
" apparently there was misinformation being spread on @entity5 and people were putting up scare messages to try to convince people to go home , " @entity62 said			2
while @entity5 became the app of choice in @entity3 's -- and saw similar success in protests earlier this year in @entity159 -- @entity62 said the app was never designed as a messaging tool for protesters			1
" what we envisioned was a service that would provide communication for people in places where there was poor connectivity and a large population density			0
cities such as @entity173 or @entity174 , " he said			0
more options @entity5 is now only one of a number of apps -- @entity179 - that are competing in the mesh - network services space			1
a @entity183 mesh - networking app called @entity184 was used in @entity185 in may after the government announced a crackdown in response to rumors that were spreading on the @entity191 homegrown messaging sevice @entity192			1
as many as 35 million people reportedly used the service , which allows users to erase their messages or chats after a certain length of time			0
private messaging is now one of the options that @entity5 is developing in the wake of the gigantic beta test its service received in the @entity3 protests			1
" we are working on adding private messaging with encryption			0
but this will take months , not weeks , " said @entity62			0
" this is much harder than for other communication apps as we need to make this work off the grid			0
" while @entity5 was a useful device for relaying information and encouragement during the early mass protests in @entity3 , it became less useful once @entity31 moved into a game of cat and mouse with the police			1
" the problem with @entity5 is that everyone around you can get your message , including the police , " explained @entity3 - based student @entity224			1
" if you 're discussing your deployment through @entity5 , the police know straight away where your weak links are			2
" read more from tomorrow transformed : can this one - wheeled wonder change the way you commute to work ? the " green man " in your traffic lights just got new super powers finally , a flying car for everybody ?			0
