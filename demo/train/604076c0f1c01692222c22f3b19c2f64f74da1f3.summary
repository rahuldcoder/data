we climbed the stairs to the third floor , where @entity3 died early in the morning of may 2 , 2011			1
i stepped into the bedroom where he was killed and looked up at the ceiling , where you could still see the patterns of blood that had spurted from @entity3 's head when the bullet fired by a @entity13 tore through the terrorist leader 's face			1
the height of the room was low for someone as tall as @entity3 , who was 6 foot 4			1
outside the bedroom was a small terrace surrounded by a high wall			0
overlooking the enclosed terrace were large and now broken plate glass windows that would have provided a lot of light for @entity3 during the day			1
in the bedroom in which @entity28 's leader finally was killed , i had expected a frisson of something ; perhaps a sensation like exploring @entity33 's bunker complex beneath the streets of @entity35 at the end of @entity37 instead , i felt only a mild curiosity			1
on a shelf in @entity3 's bedroom was a box of @entity43 hair dye ; in the final years of his life @entity3 dyed his hair and beard jet black to maintain a youthful appearance			1
i also noticed some medicines like ampicillin , ibuprofen , @entity52 energy glucose strips , @entity53 ( a penicillin ) and @entity56 syrup , which has an antispasmodic effect on the muscles of the gastrointestinal and urogenital tracts			2
i examined @entity3 's tiny bathroom , about the size of a closet , and noticed that he used a toilet that was really only a hole in the floor over which he had to squat to do his business			1
it 's not the image that one usually associates with the world 's most wanted man			2
next door to the bedroom , which he shared with his much younger @entity76 wife , was @entity3 's study			1
crude bookshelves lined the walls and another large window overlooked the enclosed terrace			0
it was here that @entity3 composed often mammoth memos to his key lieutenants as he sought to maintain some measure of control over his organization , which was now under intense assault by the @entity90 and its allies			1
some of these memos are being released on thursday by @entity92			2
* * in february i secured permission to enter @entity3 's compound in the northern @entity97 city of @entity98 , where he was killed and where he had lived for the last half - decade of his life ; the first , and only , journalist to do so			1
i was escorted by officers of @entity97 's military intelligence agency , @entity103 , past checkpoints manned by armed soldiers who were there to dissuade the merely curious from approaching the compound			1
arriving at the front gate of the @entity3 residence , we were joined by a @entity112 captain wearing a sidearm			1
he would be our escort			0
i had been instructed " no photographs			0
" clearly , this rule would be enforced were it to become necessary			0
we entered through the main metal gate of the compound , which opened onto an internal narrow street with high walls on both sides			2
we then turned right into a small field , around a third of an acre in size , where the residents of the compound grew crops			2
this field was enclosed by the compound 's walls on three sides , and on one of the sides there was a small storage shack for the harvested crops			1
i could see burn marks on one of the outer walls of the compound where the tail rotor of a helicopter had clipped the wall and broken off			2
it was the stealth @entity143 helicopter that had developed mechanical problems during the @entity13 raid that killed @entity3			1
there were also burn marks in the field where the downed chopper was subsequently blown up by the seals as the raid was ending			0
on the other side of the compound were concrete feeding pens where the residents kept cows			2
beyond that was a large garden where they grew vegetables such as cucumbers			0
in the vegetable garden there was a small " hujra " structure that functioned as a sitting room and that was littered with cardboard boxes for computer equipment			2
the @entity168 also kept honeybees and rabbits			0
on the ground there were scattered cartons of @entity174 and large empty cans of @entity177 olive oil			0
on one side of the compound was a self - contained , walled - off annex area			1
this is where @entity3 's trusted courier , @entity182 , lived with his wife and four children			1
in this annex area was a simple garage where @entity3 's courier parked his white jeep and red van			1
inside the courier 's one - story house , all the rooms were small and simple			2
they consisted of a washroom with a shower , a kitchen , a bedroom and a storage room			2
children 's toys were scattered around the floors of this building and children 's bikes were parked in the storage area			2
there were medicine bottles and cough syrup on shelves in the bathroom and a calendar in the kitchen that marked @entity214 eating and prayer times			0
follow @ @entity216 on twitter on the night of the raid , @entity97 officials found the courier 's body lying just outside his bedroom and behind a locked grey door with windows that had been shot out			2
the courier was killed with two bullets to the chin and his wife , @entity228 , was shot and wounded			0
the @entity97 intelligence official guiding me through the compound said there were no @entity234 bullets found at the scene and he therefore surmised that the courier had been taken by surprise and was shot before he could reach for his @entity234 , which was recovered leaning against the wall of the @entity240 ' bedroom			0
leaving this annex area we passed through a metal door in an internal compound wall and came into a pleasant lawn area , in the middle of which was a small structure that was used by the residents as a sun room			1
next to this was a water tank and a bread oven			0
dominating the lawn was the three - story house in which @entity3 lived with his three wives and a dozen of his children and grandchildren			1
we entered the front door of the house			0
on the right was a study and on the left a bedroom			0
on the door of this room i saw graffiti , which turned out to be verses of the @entity272			0
it was in this room where , after the raid , @entity97 officials found the courier 's brother and his wife , both shot dead			1
officials also found about a dozen children with their hands tied together in this ground floor bedroom			0
deeper into the house was a kitchen and two sizable storage rooms			0
at the back end of the ground floor was a room where the bin laden family would watch the sole tv in the compound			1
in this room was a gas heater that had an improvised exhaust system attached to it made from bits of sheet metal hammered together			0
at the back of the house was the stairwell			0
blocking the way up the stairs was a massive yellow iron metal door that sealed off access to the upper two floors of the house			0
this gate had large blast marks on it where the @entity13 forced their way through as they closed in on @entity3			1
halfway between the ground floor and the second floor , @entity97 officials found the body of @entity312 , @entity3 's 23 - year - old son , who was shot and killed by the seals on the staircase			1
the @entity13 shot to kill or wound most of the adults they encountered in the compound , killing four men , one woman and wounding two other women			0
of the 11 adults on the compound ( which included three of @entity3 's adult children : @entity312 , 23 , @entity228 , 20 , and @entity322 , 18 ) they shot seven of them			1
they did not shoot at @entity3 's two older wives			1
on the second floor of the compound were rooms for the older wives and for his various children and grandchildren			0
their beds were made from plywood boards hammered together			0
as on the previous floor , there was an improvised system of metal pipes to remove the exhaust from a gas heater			0
in the kitchen of each wife 's area there was a similar improvised exhaust system made from sheet metal to expel kitchen smells			0
the overall effect of all this was of a long - term but makeshift camping site and the overwhelming impression i had was one of squalor			1
medicines for indigestion and other ailments littered the floor and there was a large amount of broken glass everywhere , testament to the intensity of the @entity13 assault on the compound			2
this second floor had a terrace from which there was a lovely view of snow - capped mountains			0
from this terrace one could look down to an area where a guard dog was once tied and there was a coop for chickens			0
in the area where the chickens were kept i noticed several computer keyboards strewn about , presumably left there as the @entity13 hurriedly carted off much of @entity3 's computer equipment			1
the image we have of @entity3 in his final years in @entity98 is of an aging man with a graying beard watching old footage of himself ; just another suburban dad flipping though the channels with his remote			2
and in the end , @entity3 died in a squalid suburban compound surrounded by his wives and children and far from the front lines of his holy war .			1

@entity393 was only journalist to visit place where @entity3 lived *--* and died
@entity393 says the squalid compound seemed like a camping site
@entity3 's room still contained medicines and hair dye he used
from this site , @entity3 composed memos in effort to control @entity28 , @entity393 says
