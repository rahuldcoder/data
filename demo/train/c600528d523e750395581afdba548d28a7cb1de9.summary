a former @entity1 employee who spent three years helping create @entity1 has written a brutal blog post declaring the tech giant 's social network a failure			1
in a lengthy , at times profane breakdown on blogging platform medium , @entity6 , the man credited as inventor of the hashtag , writes that @entity11 missed a chance to make the service a one - stop home for its users ' online identities and , instead , created a less - popular @entity18 copycat			1
" lately , i just feel like @entity1 is confused and adrift at sea , " @entity6 wrote			1
" it 's so far behind , how can it possibly catch up ? " the november 28 post was a follow - up to a tweet in which he had mistakenly called out a bug on @entity1 that was actually caused by an external app. even as he corrected himself , he called out @entity11 for the network 's missed opportunity			1
" i f --- ed up , " @entity6 wrote			0
" @entity6 left @entity11 over a year ago to join a startup			1
before that , he had worked on the short - lived @entity33 social product , then @entity1			2
he wrote that while it was being developed under the code name " @entity1 , " @entity1 was internally being called " @entity11			2
" the idea at the time , he said , was to make the site a sort of home base for users , where they would decide which information they 'd like to share about themselves and with whom they 'd like to share it			0
" it was like @entity11 was saying , ' we 're going to be your trusted partner in cyberspace , and we 'll help you surface the right information to the people you choose , at the right time ' , " @entity6 wrote			2
" it was a functional search - oriented value proposition , rather than a social networking one			0
" thus , for me , when i searched for my mom 's phone number on @entity11 , i actually find it -- because it would be on her profile and she would have shared it with me			0
suddenly a query like ' mom phone number ' would work			0
" instead , he wrote , @entity1 became " a kind of @entity63			0
" " why did the world need another @entity18 , unless to benefit @entity11 by making their ad targeting more effective ? " @entity6 wrote			1
@entity11 did not immediately respond to a message seeking comment for this article			0
@entity6 wrote that innovation appears to be slowing for the web tool			2
in a chart , he said @entity1 and hangouts , its well - liked video chat tool , have been updated with six apps each in 2014 , compared with 15 for @entity75 and 16 for @entity76 , both of which are also @entity11 properties , and 19 for @entity18 , 29 for @entity80 and 33 for @entity81			1
aside from his personal interest , @entity6 said he 's disappointed because @entity18 , with its more than 1.3 billion users , needs competition			2
" the future of digital identity should not be determined by one company ( namely , @entity18 ) , " he said			0
" i still believe that competition in this space is better for consumers , for startups , and for the industry			0
and @entity11 still remains one of the few companies ( besides @entity95 , perhaps ) that stands a chance to take on @entity18 in this arena -- but @entity1 , as i see it , has lost its way			1

former @entity1 employee says the social tool has failed
@entity105 inventor @entity6 left @entity11 over a year ago
he says g *+* could have been about identity , became " @entity18 lite "
