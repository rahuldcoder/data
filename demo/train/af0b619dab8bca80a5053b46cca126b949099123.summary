@entity0 -- violent extremist attacks , of the kind that claimed the life of drummer @entity5 in may 2013 , do not come out of thin air			1
rather they are often the end product of a radicalization process in which extremist recruiters target impressionable young people with poisonous , pernicious and , more worryingly , appealing hate narratives			1
@entity18 to understanding why some young @entity14 @entity13 are susceptible to @entity16 - inspired hate narratives in the first place is the issue of identity			1
growing up in @entity14 during the 1980s and 90s , as the authors of this piece did , was fraught with challenges for many from ethnic minority backgrounds			1
one would experience an acute sense of dual - marginalisation from a very early age , and this feeling would be exacerbated by daily experiences			2
on one hand it was a struggle to connect with your parents , who were raised in a very different cultural context , and on the other hand it was challenging to connect with mainstream society , from which one felt alienated and discriminated			1
this created a sense of rootlessness and dislocation that resulted in an identity crisis			2
one did not know where he or she belonged , nor which aspect of one 's multi-faceted identity to emphasise			2
the out of touch and decrepit nature of the local mosques only served to heighten this acute sense of alienation and confusion			2
@entity14 imams , having been brought in from the @entity61 sub-continent , rarely spoke @entity62 and had very little understanding of the challenges facing young @entity13 growing up in @entity14			1
furthermore , most mosques were tightly controlled by a group of elderly men , who ruled with an iron fist and kept women and young people on the fringes			2
in this troubling and delicate context a number of @entity16 organizations emerged and began to offer a radical alternative			1
taking advantage of the identity crisis that many young @entity13 were suffering from , they presented @entity79 as a revolutionary political doctrine and being @entity13 as a political , as well as religious , identity			0
they also focused their efforts away from the mosques , preferring to target educational institutions , as well as other ungoverned spaces such as the internet			0
this was because the strand of theo - politics they sought to promote was alien to the traditional religious establishments in the @entity14			1
their radical reformulation of @entity79 had certain implications			1
it meant one could now reject the culture of one 's parents , since they did not understand the true @entity79 , as well as mainstream society , since it was perceived as being opposed to @entity13 interests			0
local and international grievances were weaved together and construed through a very specific narrative in which the monolithically conceived @entity104 was at war with @entity79 and @entity13			1
this new identity also recalibrated one 's sense of loyalty			0
since one was now a @entity13 only , with other nationalist identities being rejected , one 's loyalty lay with fellow @entity13			0
this exclusive loyalty was also accompanied by a sense of mission and purpose			0
conflict zones around the world that involved @entity13 were re-construed as front lines of a global war between @entity79 and @entity104 capitalism			0
there was no sitting on the fence in this battle			0
@entity13 men in particular were encouraged to see themselves as warriors who had a duty to protect the lives and dignity of @entity13 around the world , who were suffering as a direct result of western aggression and policies			0
it is this narrative , which has taken root in the @entity14 for reasons outlined above , that inspired the killers of @entity5 to do what they did			1
in fact , @entity141 articulated it very effectively during the trial , which he used as an opportunity to spout standard extremist propaganda			2
he described himself as a soldier , as did the ringleader of 7/7 , @entity148 , and highlighted the actions of @entity14 troops in @entity151			1
however , @entity16 extremists only ever present a very selective and sanitised version of their narrative to @entity156 audiences with view to eliciting a degree of sympathy			1
they fail , for example , to express any outrage at attacks on @entity163 , nor do they dwell on their ambitions of waging a global war of conquest against non-muslims			2
the fact that the killers of @entity5 were converts to @entity79 , who had adopted the narrative from charismatic street preachers , illustrates that vulnerable people from a variety of different backgrounds can be seduced by the global @entity16 narrative			1
a sense of victimhood and alienation needs to be present , as well as a strong anti-establishment sentiment			0
it , therefore , comes as no surprise that those with previous gang connections who exist at the margins of society are often targets of recruiters			0
perpetual political instability in the @entity190 , @entity191 and @entity192 also continues to provide recruiters with material to exploit and construe through a dogmatic political prism			0
in the meantime , the outreach potential of social media allows recruiters to target a much wider audience than ever before			0
without an effective response that is cognisant of the psychology of the average recruit , and approach taken by the average recruiter , the efforts of extremists will continue unabated			0
this response needs to brave and prepared to venture into ungoverned spaces , such as the internet			0
we need to take the fight to extremists by challenging and deconstructing narratives of hate and division as well as offering new models which can be used to recalibrate political thought			2
for counter-extremism practitioners such as us , eight years after 7/7 it still feels like our work has only just begun			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity220 and @entity221 .			1

extremist attacks often end product of radicalization process , *write* @entity220 and @entity221
