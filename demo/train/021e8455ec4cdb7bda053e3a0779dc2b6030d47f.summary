a former reporter for the @entity12 , he 's won every award given to mystery writers			1

the other @entity24 is @entity5 , also an award - winning and best - selling author			1
you could call him the future of crime fiction			1
@entity5 has published nine novels since 2004 , and he 's just shy of 30 years old			1
his latest , " @entity35 , " a tale of faith , football and revenge recently debuted on the @entity31 bestseller list and is getting rave reviews from fans and critics			0
the two @entity6 visited @entity40 last week for the @entity41 , one of the largest literary get - togethers in the country			0
@entity0 had a chance to sit down with the two authors to compare notes and get some insight into their highly - successful writing careers			0
the following is an edited transcript			0
@entity0 : you 're both reaching new milestones in your careers , how does it feel ? @entity5 : i feel like i 'm exactly a decade behind @entity3			1
he 's at twenty years in publishing , i 'm at ten			1
when i came in there were a group of writers who are standard bearers			1
you look at what they 're doing and think this is what i have to go chase			0
the first book i wrote that was published , my editor was telling me go read @entity3			1
i said " i am " and he said , " try again			0
" ten years later i 'm still getting that advice from everyone			1
what @entity3 's been able to sustain for twenty years is almost unprecedented in terms of the quality of the books continuing to improve			1
hopefully my books are improving			0
one of the ways i find motivation to improve is looking at someone who is already at a high level and continues to get better with each book			0
that 's really what you want to emulate			1
@entity3 : i do n't think i was one who looked at anniversaries and numbers much , but for some reason this one was significant for me			1
when you 're starting out you never believe that you might accomplish writing twenty - five books in twenty years			1
it 's really bizarre to even contemplate			1
twenty years was significant as well because of what happened in @entity95 in 1992			1
my first book was published in january of that year so it was kind of a new world opening up to me			1
a few months later the city was torn apart by riots after the @entity103 trial			0
i really did weigh all these anniversaries and years when writing this book			2
i think it 's the first time i ever really thought about that			2
the book 's about the death of a journalist and during the riots i almost got killed			2
that 's something i worked out in a lot of my books			2
so that all played into it , there 's a lot of nostalgia , all of it was really important to me and i never really had this kind of stuff inspiring me before			2
@entity0 : how have you both remained so prolific ? @entity3 : what @entity5 has done is remarkable			1
my first book was n't published until i was 36			2
now he 's almost thirty and on his ninth book			2
you know i 'm bragging about how i 'm on book 25 and he 's probably thinking about 75			2
that 's hard for me to imagine , what he 's doing			2
i feel like i 'm making up for lost time			0
that 's part of what drives me			2
for some reason , i do n't know why i had this idea , maybe because i was 36 when my first book was published , but i wanted to write 36 books before i 'm done			2
i love the play " @entity141			0
" in the movie , @entity143 says , " always be closing			0
" i feel the same way			0
for me closing is writing , always be doing it			0
@entity5 : i knew at a young age this is what i wanted to do			1
i look at the fact that i got an early start -- that was a real blessing to me because it gave me a greater opportunity to tell more stories , hopefully , and at the end of the day that 's what i want to do			2
what i love is the writing , it 's not having written			2
i like the process of it			0
@entity0 : do you view writing as a competition or camaraderie ? @entity5 : i 've always felt an incredible amount of generosity from the time i showed up , people going out of their way to help me who did n't have to			1
it seems like there 's a really good spirit of brotherhood , especially in crime fiction			1
in terms of competition , anytime i read a book that i think is really good , like " @entity22 , " i love it and i 'm rooting for @entity3 as a friend but there 's also a spark of , this is a better book than what i wrote and now i 've got to try and catch up with that			1
for me , that 's the greatest motivation to improve is to see really good writers continue to get better and continue to pull farther away from you			1
you 're always chasing the rabbit , and that 's a good thing			2
@entity3 : there 's always been a good mix of camaraderie and motivation			1
we 're lucky in the genre we pursue , it 's so big			1
we 're not worried about , that book is so good it 's going to take sales away from me			2
you just do n't see that			0
readers love to read good stuff , so there 's no reason to really be competitive			2
@entity0 : do you prefer writing a stand alone novel or a continuing series character ? @entity5 : what i like about writing a stand alone novel is you 're starting with a fresh world and fresh characters			1
part of what i love about writing is that journey of discovery where it 's all new to me as well			2
this is my fourth stand alone in a row and i am beginning to get a little bit of an itch now to take a longer ride with a character , to get to know them a little better			0
in " @entity35 " i really fell in love with those characters , there was an emotional connection there that i do n't think i 've had in a while			0
it made me think it would be nice to stick with the characters for a little bit and see what happens			0
my next book will be a stand alone but after that i 'm thinking about trying to take a little bit longer ride			0
@entity3 : a series character like @entity20 can be a trap but it 's a good trap to be in			1
this idea that it 's an unfinished story with more to say			0
i guess i never write standalones			0
even if i come up with a new character , i often bring them back			0
the last time i introduced a new character was " @entity248 , " and now that 's going on seven or eight years			1
i 'm already writing my next book and it 's @entity250 , but i kind of feel like creatively i need to come up with something new pretty soon			0
@entity0 : if you could steal an idea from the other @entity3 what would it be ? @entity3 : i would be an esoteric thief			1
maybe it 's the comfort of age but i look at what @entity3 has done with writing different kinds of genres			1
i 've been more straight laced , straight crime			0
i 've never broken away ; all my stuff is in the same vein			0
it takes a certain amount of courage and confidence to pop out a book that 's going to be compared to @entity269 instead of @entity270			0
so i would steal that kind of creative courage			0
@entity5 : courage is one word for it			1
i 've been shamelessly stealing from @entity3 for years			1
it 's his ability to say so much with one simple sentence that has what i call layers of depth			0
it 's the words beneath the words			0
he does that every book , time after time after time			0
he 'll lay out a beautiful line , @entity287 thinking on the surface what is a very simple thought or observation but it has ripples to the past , the present and goes deeper to the core of the character			0
he has the ability and the confidence to let it ride on top and know that the reader will get it and feel that impact			0
that 's an incredible gift and that 's just great writing .			0

@entity3 is a crime fiction veteran , while @entity5 may be the " future " of the genre
@entity3 has won every award given to mystery writers
@entity5 has published nine novels since 2004 and he 's just shy of 30 years old
