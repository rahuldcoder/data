@entity3 leaders ' appreciate ' @entity40 another statement released by a @entity3 spokesman sunday said a high - ranking delegation recently met in an " atmosphere of peace and sincerity " with representatives of the @entity48 in the @entity49			2
the @entity3 representatives " appreciate " @entity1 president @entity40 's release of 65 prisoners in february , the statement said			1
it credited the release " as a reply to our previous demands in this regard			0
" @entity5 officials strongly objected to the release of men who they said pose a threat to security forces and civilians			0
the group included an alleged @entity3 explosives expert , a suspected @entity70 commander and a specialist accused of building and placing improvised explosive devices			0
" these individuals are dangerous , " @entity75 spokeswoman @entity74 said			0
" they pose threats to the safety and security of the @entity1 people and the @entity1 state			0
" negotiating with terrorists @entity5 officials are adamant that they have never given up on trying to get @entity6 back and resist calling the current effort " renewed " discussions			1
but driving the current effort , according to the @entity5 official , is @entity6 's poor health and concern that a full troop withdrawal from @entity1 at year 's end would essentially close the door on any rescue attempt			1
the @entity5 has long declared that it wo n't negotiate with terrorists , which is what it considers the @entity3			2

" i think we need to give the green light to the special ops and let them do their jobs quietly and methodically , as they have done so well in the past , " he added			0
who is @entity6 ? fits and starts in may 2012 , the @entity5 government acknowledged that it had been engaged in talks with the @entity3 to free @entity6 , but those talks moved in fits and starts because of @entity5 concerns that any @entity3 prisoners swapped for the sergeant might be repatriated and allowed to rejoin the fight			1
