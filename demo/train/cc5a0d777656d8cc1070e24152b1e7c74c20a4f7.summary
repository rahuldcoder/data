" i do n't know if organized criminals have the capability to do something to the @entity4			1
but they are certainly thinking about it			2
" these words , uttered in a recent interview by an @entity9 anti-mafia prosecutor , do n't quite justify the alarming worldwide headlines they provoked , but at the same time it would be rash to dismiss them out of hand			1
the new @entity4 represents a serious threat to some established criminal interests at a critical moment in the long history of the @entity21 ' relationship with @entity22 -- a past marked by both intimacy and violence			1
read more : prosecutor says @entity4 faces mafia threat @entity9 's @entity28 problem is as old as the @entity9 state			1
the three major @entity21 -- the @entity30 , the ' @entity31 , and @entity28 -- originated in the political violence that led up to @entity9 unification in 1860			1
but only in 1993 did a @entity4 explicitly denounce the @entity28			1
speaking in @entity35 , @entity34 warned mobsters that @entity38 's judgement was at hand			2
@entity28 's own verdict on the @entity4 's words came two months later , when it planted bombs that seriously damaged two ancient churches in @entity44			1
before that epoch - making rupture , mafiosi and priests had rubbed along pretty well			2
the @entity49 loathed the new @entity9 state because its unification had robbed the pontiff of his earthly kingdom , leaving him only with the @entity55			1
so the @entity49 looked elsewhere for pious sources of authority			2
and @entity28 bosses have always been good at dressing up as devout paladins of order			2
the local saint 's day , when a statue is carried through the streets amid prayers and singing , is the focal point of the calendar in many @entity9 towns and villages			1
all too often , the local capo would place himself at the head of the parade			2
the ' @entity31 even used a religious festival as cover for its annual general meeting			2
since the 1890s , the bosses from across @entity78 have gathered in early september at the @entity80			2
during the @entity81 , the @entity49 stood firmly in the anti-communist camp			2
mafia bosses had every interest in posing as bulwarks against the red menace because it helped them cosy up to the @entity87 -- the @entity22 political party that held power until 1994			1
in 1964 , the @entity89 archbishop of @entity90 denounced any talk of the @entity28 as a @entity93 plot to besmirch @entity35			2
in 1982 , @entity34 visited @entity90 in the middle of an underworld war that saw hundreds killed , and he did not once use the m - word			2
read more : @entity4 but same old church ? so the @entity49 was , at best , culpably silent about @entity9 's permanent @entity28 emergency			1
over that time , mafiosi learned to speak religious language and twist it to their own ends			0
the evidence is overwhelming : most @entity9 gangsters are believers			1
during the making of a recent documentary for @entity9 television , i visited many of the fortified bunkers that ' @entity31 bosses have built in case they need to go to ground			1
not one was without its crucifixes , its statuettes of saints , its paintings of the @entity121			0
i accompanied the carabinieri ( military police ) on a raid on a boss 's villa that had been modelled on the house from the final scene of the movie @entity130			0
not only was there a large effigy of the @entity133 outside the front door , but the interior was decorated with various religious trinkets that competed for space with samurai swords and replica machine guns			0
religion offers the @entity21 a way to bind their organizations together , and gives them the feeling that they are extorting and killing in the name of a cause more noble than their own greed			1
the piety of the majority of @entity28 affiliates is the ultimate proof of the truism that religion can be used to justify any cause			0
so what changed ? why did @entity34 make his famous denunciation of the @entity28 in 1993 ? there are two fundamental reasons			1
@entity159 , the end of the @entity81			0
and second , in 1992 , the clamorous bombing assassinations of @entity162 and @entity163 , @entity9 's two leading @entity165 prosecutors			1
since then , the @entity166 has entrenched its stance against the mob			0
an important symbolic gesture came earlier this year , when father @entity170 , a @entity90 priest murdered by @entity28 in 1993 , was beatified			2
read more : @entity4 's embrace of disfigured man goes viral much remains to be done before the @entity49 in its entirety can be said to have distanced itself from the @entity28			1
priests are not always keen to dance to the new tune issuing from @entity178 's			0
some still preside over the lavish weddings that weld underworld dynasties together			0
religious festivals are still subject to @entity28 infiltration			0
pope @entity183 is determined that there will be no turning back			1
he used the beatification of father @entity170 as his cue to repeat @entity34 's denunciation of the @entity28 from twenty years back			0
but the new @entity4 is also taking the battle against crime beyond the realm of words and symbols			1
the decisive terrain on which that battle will be fought is finance			0
but its finances are also bafflingly complex and utterly lacking in transparency			0
at the centre of its archipelago of financial institutions sits the @entity202 ( or @entity202 ) -- the @entity202			0
it handles the money of many religious orders			0
but it also acts like a little piece of the @entity208 on the western side of the @entity210 , which is what makes it attractive to people who want to keep their wealth away from the prying eyes of the law			0
the @entity202 has been tainted with scandal before			0
in 1982 it was implicated in the fraudulent bankruptcy of the @entity219 , whose president , @entity220 , was found hanging under @entity222 in @entity223			0
although his murder , or suicide , is still unsolved , it seems highly likely that he was laundering @entity28 's heroin profits			0
most observers think that the @entity49 's efforts to reform its finances in the wake of the @entity220 scandal were desultory			0
but now @entity183 has hired external expertise to bring the @entity202 into line with international standards of transparency and probity			1
just a few days ago he was particularly frank in condemning @entity9 who worship " the goddess bribe " , and who give to charity while dodging tax			1
nobody knows how far the rot extends			0
many suspect that the @entity21 and sundry other shady cabals have for years been concealing money under the noses of bishops and cardinals			0
if @entity183 is really determined to carry through his clean - up , then likely as not there are plenty of people who would wish him harm			1
so would the @entity28 really murder the @entity4 ? it is very unlikely			1
the @entity21 rarely kill without first carrying out a cost - benefit analysis			0
even a rudimentary projection of the likely consequences of a hit on the head of the @entity49 would show it to be a catastrophic own goal			1
a much more probable scenario is that the @entity49 will carry on reforming its finances , but at its habitual leaden - footed pace			0
meanwhile , the dirty money will be spirited away .			0

@entity9 anti-mob prosecutor says @entity4 faces threat from the mafia
@entity276 says @entity183 represents serious threat to established criminal interests
mafias originated in 1860 but @entity4 did n't explicitly denounce the mafia until 1993
@entity276 says killing the @entity4 would be a " catastrophic own goal " for the mafias
