nervous anticipation extends far beyond the racially charged powder keg of @entity2 , @entity3 , over a grand jury decision on whether to indict a white police officer for fatally shooting an unarmed black teenager			1
the @entity8 suburb has simmered with anger since the day in august when 18 - year - old @entity10 was shot multiple times by officer @entity12			2
with the grand jury expected to deliver its decision any day , people worry that tensions could boil over -- not only in @entity2 , but at demonstrations in more than 30 cities from @entity19 to @entity20 organized by a group called the @entity22 , mostly for the day after the decision is announced			1
while most protests in @entity2 have been peaceful , some devolved into violence , especially in the nights immediately after the shooting			1
the imminent decision has renewed concerns over clashes between protesters and heavily armed law enforcement officers , especially if @entity12 is not indicted			1
" i , like so many other people , am on pins and needles , " said the rev. @entity34 , a @entity35 - based deputy director of the community organizing group @entity36			2
" this case has resonated with a lot of people who are beginning to understand that the issue of police violence and lawlessness is an issue that , although for the moment is focused on @entity2 ... it is an issue that challenges the nation			1
" though @entity34 expects to be in @entity2 after the announcement , he said members of the network 's 3,000 multidenominational congregations around the country plan to participate in vigils and protests			1
the @entity22 lists planned community responses to the grand jury decision in big cities such as @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
it 's also planned public gatherings -- to be held the day of the announcement or the day after -- in smaller cities that include @entity67 , @entity68 ; @entity69 , @entity70 ; @entity71 , @entity72 ; @entity73 , @entity74 ; @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , @entity78			2
" the faith community has been quite busy on issue of @entity2 , " @entity34 said			1
" it has been a challenging experience because many clergy have been looking for how they make the connection between the faith they celebrate on sunday and the everyday cares , challenges and struggles that their people face the other six days of the week			2
" police departments prepare throughout the country , law enforcement agencies have been busy with @entity2			1
" many of my colleagues i 've had an opportunity over the last few days to talk to around the country ... are preparing for whatever the outcome may happen to be , " said @entity93 , president of the @entity94 and public safety director for @entity96 , @entity97			2
@entity93 said law enforcement agencies in the @entity107 area , for instance , have " working relationships with our community members and leaders " and are preparing to mobilize should tensions erupt			1
" there are many communities in which we really have to engage our communities and set some real parameters about how we 're going to work together , " @entity93 said			2
@entity107 police spokeswoman @entity115 said the department will respect the rights of demonstrators to peaceably assemble but will not " tolerate those who violate our laws , destroy property or endanger lives			0
" " we have met with , and are in discussion with , numerous law enforcement agencies throughout the metro @entity107 area to ensure our efforts are coordinated , and that we are maintaining the same level of readiness and vigilance , " she said			1
in @entity133 , a @entity132 police spokesman , lt. @entity130 , said the city did not anticipate violent demonstrations following the grand jury decision			1
" however , we have adequate resources in place to address any situation that may arise , " he said			0
" in addition to the resources , we work hard to develop and maintain strong relationships within our communities			0
we feel confident that together we can address such a situation if it arises			0
" police officials would not reveal specific preparations			0
but @entity146 law enforcement analyst @entity145 , a former @entity147 assistant director and police officer , said federal agencies will likely be working with local police departments , particularly sharing information on agitators from the @entity153 and abroad who typically move from state to state to stir problems at public demonstrations			1
and law enforcement agencies in cities such as @entity159 and @entity35 have extensive experience dealing with protests			1
" the @entity163 police have demonstrations in downtown @entity35 all the time , " he said			2
" it 's not like they 're not prepared or equipped			0
people will be on heightened alert			0
when the word goes out that the decision has been made , departments are going to be trying to at least be ready , to have their officers on standby to go to extended shifts and whatever might be necessary to prevent things from getting out of hand			2
" unresolved tensions when members of the @entity180 met with police chiefs from around the country in @entity183 , @entity184 , last month , the situation in @entity2 was at the top of the agenda			1
conference spokeswoman @entity187 said the group has had internal discussions on how to react to the grand jury decision but will not make a statement on the case until the announcement			1
" we do n't know what 's going to happen , " she said			0
" we 're waiting like everybody else			0
" outgoing @entity153 attorney general @entity197 told the gathering of mayors and police chiefs that law enforcement had a responsibility to address tensions within communities			1
" the events in @entity2 reminded us that we can not and we must not allow tensions , which are present in so many neighborhoods across @entity153 , to go unresolved , " @entity197 said			2
the @entity2 case , @entity197 said , underscored divisions between police and residents in many @entity153 cities			1
" when i traveled to @entity2 in the days after that incident , my pledge to the people of that community was that our nation 's @entity216 would remain focused on the challenges they faced , and the deep - seated issues and difficult conversations that the shooting brought to the surface , long after national headlines had faded , " he said			2
federal officials are conducting two civil rights investigations , one into @entity10 's killing and the other into the local police department 's overall track record with minorities			0
free speech , worries about violence police will be on hand at protests to ensure freedom of expression -- without any criminal activity			0
@entity36 , on its website , says it opposes " any militarized response against @entity153 citizens exercising our right to freely and peaceably assemble			0
" @entity3 gov. @entity247 has called for protests to remain peaceful once the grand jury rules in @entity12 's case but vowed to crack down on any " ugliness			1
" @entity247 made clear last week he 's not anticipating violence , but wants to be ready for anything			0
people have a right to express their views and grievances , but they do not have the right to put their fellow citizens or their property at risk , " he said			0
many protesters , furious because they felt @entity10 's killing was an example of excessive force , clashed with heavily armed law enforcement in the streets for days after the shooting			1
@entity270 , who responded in armored vehicles and military gear , were criticized for escalating the violence rather than tempering it			0
@entity10 's family has implored would - be protesters to refrain from the looting and violence that marred the early protests			0
but through its attorney , the family asked authorities to use " reasonable restraints " in dealing with protesters			0
the attorney blamed assault rifles , manhandling , tear gas , rubber bullets and false arrests for agitating the protesters who took to the streets			0
@entity145 said people on both sides of the issue have all but telegraphed what 's to come after the grand jury decision is announced			1
what happens in @entity2 , he said , can influence what happens in the rest of the country			1
" when you have demonstrations , emotions are high , " @entity145 said			2
" when you have high emotions , a mob can get out of control			0
... when emotions are high , all it takes is one or two people to incite the crowd into doing something else			0
and one bad cop can incite things if shots are fired or if the police do something too aggressive			0
it can work both ways			0

cities around the country *anxiously* await grand jury decision in @entity2 case
group calls for demonstrations in more than 30 cities from @entity19 to @entity20
