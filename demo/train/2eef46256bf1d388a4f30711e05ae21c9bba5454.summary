-- @entity2 parents have a new fear to factor in this @entity4 : a very adult treat ending up in their kids ' candy bags			1
the legalization of recreational marijuana sales in the @entity10 earlier this year has led to a massive tourism boom ( bringing in $ 19 million in tax revenue in the first half of the year ) -- and the cash crop is n't just going up in smoke			1
edible foods and candies infused with @entity18 , the active ingredient in pot , have proved to be immensely popular with consumers , but they also pose a potential problem for parents trying to keep weed out of trick - or - treaters ' hands			1
for people seeking a mellow , munchable fix , edibles may seem like an ideal solution -- until they bite off more than they bargained for			2
in late july , state officials enacted emergency measures to combat a rash of overdoses by inexperienced consumers , unfamiliar with the potency of pot in its edible form , and er visits by children who had unwittingly ingested the drug at school or home			2
the rules as proposed ( @entity44 ) by the @entity45 would require products to have child - proof packaging and clearly printed health warning labels before being shipped to stores , as well as strict @entity18 limits for various serving sizes			0
but those laws are n't set to go into effect until the day after the biggest candy - consuming holiday of the year : @entity4			1
in response , the @entity55 has released a @entity58 video outlining some of the dangers that parents may face			0
in the video , @entity61 , owner of @entity63 's @entity62 , explained that rather than crafting sweets from scratch , many edibles shops buy soft or hard candy in bulk , then spray it with viscous hash oil			1
" once that candy dries , there 's really no way to tell the difference between candy that 's infused and candy that 's not infused , " @entity61 warned			0
to keep under - 21 ghouls from gobbling up potentially pot - laced goodies , @entity61 recommends parents take a few measures : if the candy does n't come from a recognized major brand , like @entity83 's , @entity84 , @entity85 or others , it 's safest to just discard it out of the reach of children			1
packages that have been tampered with in any way should also hit the trash			0
the @entity55 also addressed the issue in a recent " @entity95 " podcast , after hearing concerns from parents			0
@entity55 sergeant @entity98 interviewed sergeant @entity99 and detective @entity100 from the @entity101 , who reiterated @entity61 's advice to parents to seek candy in its original package			2
" if you see something that does n't look right , apples , gummy bears -- there 's a ton of edible stuff that 's out there on the market that 's infused with marijuana that could be a big problem for your child , " said @entity99			0
@entity100 advised parents taking a keen eye to their child 's candy haul as they would on any previous @entity4 , but with a special focus on labels that may seek to imitate classic candies			2
" all marijuana edibles have to be labeled ... there will be a state of @entity2 seal from the @entity131 , " @entity100 said , adding that it is paramount to " avoid and not consume anything that is out of the package			1
" and the nose does n't always know , either			0
while marijuana has a distinctive , pungent smell , it 's usually not detectable with a whiff of an edible			0
" it may not smell exactly like a candy or a brownie or chocolate bar that you 're used to , but you may not be able to identify it , " said @entity100			0
while parental inspection has long been part of the candy - collection ritual , @entity99 noted that pot edibles ' prevalence -- and potency due to the use of oil , rather than ground - up plants -- added a spooky new layer to the holiday			1
" you do need to talk to your kids about it prior to this because you know how kids are -- they reach into a bag and they want to eat that piece of candy right away , " he said .			2
