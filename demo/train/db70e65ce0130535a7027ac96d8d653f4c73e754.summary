former @entity1 governor and presidential hopeful @entity2 sparked outrage across the country this week for his offensive remarks about women and birth control			1
but the real problem is n't what he says -- it 's what he and too many other politicians believe , and it 's the policies they would advance if they have the chance			0
in a speech to the @entity18 , @entity2 said that it was wrong to give women access to no - co - pay birth control under the @entity22 -- that by doing so , women were being told " they are helpless without @entity25 coming in and providing for them a prescription each month for birth control because they can not control their libido or their reproductive system without the help of government			1
" of the thousands of types of medical care covered by insurance companies -- somehow he and a lot of other politicians have focused like a laser on birth control -- on taking coverage away from women			1
indeed , @entity2 's remarks were no " gaffe , " as too many pundits have called them			0
this is a speech he 's made before , and his remarks are a look inside the playbook of politicians who appear to have no idea how birth control works and why it 's so important to millions of women as a basic , preventive health care			1
they ignore the fact that women use birth control for a whole host of medical reasons -- and that 's their business , not @entity2 's			1
in @entity2 's vision , every boss in @entity64 would be empowered to decide whether his or her female employees should have access to birth control the way they do for any other prescription medication			1
@entity2 is joining a battle being waged cross the country			0
over 40 for - profit companies have filed lawsuits against the birth control benefit of the @entity22 , and the @entity76 will hear arguments in two of those cases in march			2
if the court rules in favor of the for - profit companies , employers for the first time ever could have the right to dictate to their employees the type of health care they may have access to			0
meanwhile , 20 state legislatures have moved to exempt certain employers and insurers from allowing their employees access to birth control without a co-pay			0
in @entity96 , pharmacists are allowed to refuse to fill a prescription for birth control if they have a moral objection -- even if there 's no other pharmacist in the area that a woman can go to instead			1
and while the states are individually waging separate battles , on the national front the @entity64 @entity104 approved an amendment a few months ago to roll back the birth control benefit			0
the politicians behind these moves disregard how important birth control is for women and families			1
it allows women to take control of their health and economic security and to take personal responsibility for their family planning decisions			0
many women also need birth control for medical reasons			1
for example , it can help relieve painful menstrual cramps , and help avert infertility by addressing the symptoms of endometriosis			0
access to birth control is also an economic issue			1
until now , the cost has been expensive , with many women paying an average of $ 600 a year -- but sometimes much more -- for contraceptive protection			0
the @entity22 enables 27 million women to receive their prescription birth control without a co-pay			2
birth control also allows women , who make up nearly two - thirds of minimum - wage workers , to remain in the labor force			2
for a woman working for minimum wage at a retail store , or for tips at a restaurant , the birth control benefit is tremendously important			0
for many women , it means the difference between taking birth control regularly and not being able to -- between getting pregnant and not getting pregnant			2
as we look toward the midterm elections later this year , it 's increasingly clear that access to birth control will be on the ballot			2
@entity2 's remarks this week underscore what 's at stake -- and why women will not allow out - of - touch politicians to take us back to the 1950s .			0
