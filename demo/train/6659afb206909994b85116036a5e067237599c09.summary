traditional @entity0 living in one of the world 's most famous wildlife centers are pitting themselves against the government in a fight for land			1
the @entity8 region in northern @entity9 lies along the famed southern migratory route , where herds of wildebeest and zebra graze at roadsides and antelope dart around the trees			1
in colonial times it was a hunting ground for @entity20 royalty			0
today , it is @entity23 royals and other wealthy visitors being granted the right to hunt , fanning a controversy that has simmered for two decades			0
the @entity9 government is threatening to evict the local @entity0 community from the area in a bid to create a 4000 square kilometer " conservation corridor			1
" they say it is to protect the wildlife -- which is also a major source of income from hunting and safaris -- from @entity0 cattle overgrazing the land			1
under the plan , most of the conservation corridor will still be accessible for grazing but no one will be allowed to live there			1
the other 1500 sq. km. will be a " game controlled area " , where hunting is permitted and access controlled			1
@entity0 leaders say it means they will be evicted from their own land and will lose about 40 percent of their grazing land			1
@entity8 's lush hills are where the @entity0 take their cattle to graze during the dry season			1
to restrict their access , the @entity0 say , is " a death sentence			1
" for rural @entity0 cattle provide milk , meat , blood -- and can even be used as currency			1
their survival is the community 's survival			0

the same year the government granted a hunting concession to the @entity76 ( @entity76 )			0
owned by royals from the @entity23 , the terms of @entity76 's concession grant it hunting rights in @entity8			2
@entity76 spokesman @entity82 told @entity83 the land issue has nothing to do with his corporation , as they do not actually own land in @entity8			2
he says , in fact , that the new conservation corridor will reduce their areas , with the government set to deduct 2,500 sq. km. from their hunting concession			1
" our hunting operations are guided by @entity9 wildlife acts and regulations , " he said			2
" everything is done according to procedures			0
" in one @entity8 village , @entity0 gathered from all over the district to discuss the issue			1
many walked for miles to get there -- eager to hear what their leaders would propose			0
@entity108 is head of the @entity109 , under which @entity8 falls			2
he has a government notice which he says details the intended eviction			0
in his hands he holds a thick dossier			0
in it , he says , are their land title deeds			0
@entity108 says : " i can show you all the title deeds of the village land			0
how can they say that the land does not belong to the community ? " " this is because the government wants to give the @entity76 , the hunting company , the @entity127 hunting company land for hunting without being disturbed by the local communities			0
" the @entity9 government maintains it owns the land			2
in response to the @entity0 allegations , the @entity9 government referred @entity83 to an earlier statement in which the minister for natural resources denied @entity76 were a factor in the decision to evict			1
the statement read : " it took this decision with the understanding that environment conservation is as important for eco-system protection as it is for community livelihood and community development ... surely no government in the world can be blamed for meeting its responsibilities to such high levels			2
" more than 60,000 @entity9 @entity0 live in the 4000 sq. km. that make up @entity8			1
human rights groups say every one of them will be affected if the eviction goes through			0
@entity108 told @entity83 they were pleading for a government rethink			0
he said : " if [ they ] do this , the livelihoods of these people , the citizens of this country , will be lost and we are saying we will not move from here			0
" " this is our last weapon , " he said			0
" it is better to die rather than to just leave this land			0
" this is not the first time the @entity0 have been forcibly moved from their land			1
they were evicted repeatedly in colonial times and then again to make way for @entity172 's famed wildlife reserves			1
the @entity0 say each move eroded their livelihoods and way of life			2
this time they say they will not be moved , whatever the consequences			0
the @entity9 parliament has announced plans to convene a two - day debate to discuss options			2
