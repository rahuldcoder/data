@entity0 -- where can you buy a large punk rock head complete with pink @entity6 haircut , @entity8 ' coat and umbrella , and a pair of competition boxing gloves used by elite athletes ? the answer is the @entity15 auction site where organizers are selling off everything from the discus and javelins thrown by competitors to props and costumes used in the opening ceremony			2
although the @entity15 closed sunday with the @entity25 flag being handed over to the 2016 host city of @entity27 , enthusiasm for the @entity15 appears to be as strong as during the last two weeks when competitors performed in front of packed stadia and to a global audience of millions			0
with only a few hours left in one sale , more than £ 3,000 ( $ 4,709 ) has been bid for the basketball used in the men 's final won by the @entity36 in a close - fought game with @entity38			1
it remains to be seen whether these bids are completed , but another enthusiast has offered double the basketball price for a limited edition of a 2012 @entity25 torch signed by @entity45 -- the @entity47 cyclist who added the time trial gold medal to his victory in this year 's @entity51			0
another bidder says they are prepared to pay £ 3,000 ( $ 4,709 ) for a two - meter high sculpture of @entity55 -- one of the 2012 mascots -- and £ 456 ( $ 716 ) is the current price for a set of goal posts used in the handball final			1
the @entity15 organizing committee , @entity62 , says the money raised so far has helped subsidize the costs of torches and torchbearers and also contributes towards hosting the giant sporting festival			1
organizers say building the venues , improving infrastructure and staging the event cost in excess of £ 9 billion ( $ 14 billion ) with the cash coming from both public funds and through sponsorship , ticket sales , merchandizing and the sale of media rights			0
" there has been a lot of interest on the site and it 's great to see people want to own a piece of @entity25 history , " said a @entity62 spokesperson			2
" we 've had 1,735 different items put up for sale ... and the biggest seller has been the torches			2
