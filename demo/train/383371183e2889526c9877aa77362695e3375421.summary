@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 was deciding on whether or not to get breast implants , she told the operating surgeon that she was concerned about leaking silicone from the implants			1
so he placed in front of her an implant and sliced it open to show her how the silicone remained solid inside , assuring her it would not spill out into her body			1
she said it looked like jelly candy			0
" when i was told that there was absolutely no chance of this breast implant leaking because of this ' jelly baby effect ' , if you like			1
well , that was about 50 % of the decision because it felt safe and it was guaranteed for 25 years , " @entity21 told @entity2 at her home in @entity0			0
" i did n't think to check the manufacturer ... because it 's not something you do			0
you go to someone who 's supposed to be medically qualified and you trust them , " she said			0
" when you go to a doctor , you do n't say : who makes your medicine ? you just assume they 're going to be safe			0
" the manufacturer was @entity35 -- the bankrupt @entity36 company that appears to have used industrial grade silicone intending for stuffing mattresses inside breast implants			1
now , there are concerns that @entity35 implants are also more prone to leaking and rupturing			1
@entity36 authorities announced last month that the government would pay for the removal of the bankrupt company 's implants			1
authorities in @entity36 and @entity1 have dismissed fears of cancer from the implants , but have said the devices are prone to rupture and could cause inflammation , scarring and fibrosis			1
more than 500 @entity36 women have had the implants removed since last year , according to the @entity36 government agency that evaluates the safety of medical products			1
since then , more than 1,000 implants have ruptured , the agency said			1
@entity64 , @entity63 weigh in on breast implant concerns months after her surgery , @entity4 says she began to get burning and stabbing pains in the area			1
more recently , she has found a hard mass in one breast			0
she fears that her pip implants have leaked and she wants them removed and replaced immediately			2
" it 's like a ticking time bomb inside me			0
until someone says you can have them taken out and put back in again , i 'm going to be worried , " @entity21 says			0
the problem : who will pay for the operation ? @entity63 's @entity81 does not pay for cosmetic surgery , so an estimated 95 % of breast implant operations are done in private clinics			1
but now that women are demanding @entity35 implants be removed , some clinics are refusing to treat them			2
@entity4 says she saved up and paid almost $ 8000 for her breast implants , including surgery and after care			2
but the clinic refused to giver her a scan to detect ruptures , she says , and also declined to consider removing and replacing the implants until there was a proven problem			2
the clinic refused to comment to @entity2 citing privacy concerns			0
" i think ultimately it 's the surgeons and the clinics , whoever bought the implants and certified their use , that should be held responsible , " she says			2
the @entity63 government agrees , but says there is still no statistical data to show that @entity35 implants are either toxic or more prone to rupturing			1
" our advice remains the same that there is not sufficient evidence to recommend routine removal			0
we have always recommended that women who are concerned should speak to their surgeon or gp , " @entity63 health secretary @entity117 in a statement			1
" the @entity81 will support removal of @entity35 implants if , after this consultation , the patient still has concerns and with her doctor she decides that it is right to do so			2
" we believe that private healthcare providers have a moral duty to offer the same service to their patients that we will offer to @entity81 patients -- free information , consultations , scans and removal if necessary , " @entity117 said			0
but if clinics do not follow through , he added , the @entity81 will be called upon to step in and support patients			0
ultimately , taxpayers may have to foot the bill in some cases			0
that 's not what @entity4 wants			0
she wants the private clinic and surgeon to pay to remove and replace the @entity35 implants as soon as possible , but she realizes that may not happen until after a long legal battle			1
she does n't regret the decision to get implants , she says , but she does wish she had chosen a different , more discerning clinic			2
" and to think i 've got mattress silicone inside me and @entity153 knows what else they used , " she grimaces over a cup of tea in her kitchen			2
" it 's just disgusting , really			0
