the @entity0 to the @entity1 on the @entity2 shows the @entity3 is making progress in controlling some tumors , but rates of human papillomavirus - related cancers remain stubbornly high			1
overall , the report shows lower cancer rates in the @entity3 among all genders and racial and ethnic groups for the most common cancers , including lung , colon , anal , breast and prostate			1
but rates of hpv - related cancers , like cervical cancer , are elevated despite the fact that a vaccine exists to prevent the viral infection that can trigger the disease			1
" it 's hard not to be happy that the death rates of these major cancers are going down , but i think the @entity32 issue is pressing			1
if you ca n't get individuals to get vaccinated because getting cancer is horrible , then there has to be an economic side to this because treating people with these cancers is expensive , " says dr. @entity33 , director of the @entity34 at the @entity35 in @entity36			2
" i think the biggest challenge we face is figuring out a way to vaccinate individuals to prevent this			0
" @entity50 : study hints at potential increased risk of cancer among 9/11 rescue workers the @entity55 approved the first vaccine against a cancer , @entity57 , which protects against the @entity32 strains that can trigger cervical cancer and genital warts , in 2006			1
shortly after approval , the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) , which sets immunization guidelines , added the hpv vaccine to its lineup of recommended childhood vaccinations , proposing that girls ages 11 to 12 be immunized against the sexually transmitted @entity32 before they became sexually active			1
state health departments , which follow @entity61 guidelines , began mandating the shot for school entry , but parents balked			0
the so - called promiscuity vaccine , as they saw it , would only promote sexual activity and many refused to vaccinate their preteen children for a sexually transmitted disease			0
( @entity79 shows that 's not case			0
) in 2010 , only 48.7 % of girls ages 13 through 17 received at least one dose of the three - dose hpv vaccine ( @entity85 joined @entity57 as the second hpv vaccine in 2009 ) , and only 32 % received all three recommended doses			1
considering the @entity3 government 's @entity90 2020 target is 80 % vaccination among girls ages 13 to 15 for all three doses , those immunization rates are lagging			1
comparatively , vaccination rates are much higher in @entity96 , the @entity97 and @entity98			0
the shots are effective at controlling the most common strains responsible for cervical cancer , and public - health officials still see the vaccine as a powerful weapon in keeping rates of this cancer down			1
between 2000 and ' 09 , rates of @entity32 - associated cancers declined in all women except @entity110 and @entity111 , among whom vaccination rates are lower			1
@entity50 : an experimental cervical cancer vaccine shows promise and the benefits of the anticancer vaccine are n't limited to girls			1
the same virus that contributes to cervical cancer can also lead to anal and oral cancers , which is why the @entity61 also recommends the shot for boys ages 11 to 12 years as well			2
" it 's not unique to certain populations , and hpv infections are now across all demographics , and that is one reason we are seeing more anal cancers , " says dr. @entity124 , a colorectal - cancer surgeon at @entity35			2
" it 's not a topic that 's in the media very often			0
" that frustrates cancer experts and public - health officials since the hpv - related cancers are among the most preventable , with proper vaccination			2
but misconceptions about the vaccine and its potential side effects — former presidential hopeful @entity145 erroneously linked hpv to mental retardation — and parental resistance to inoculating young children against a sexually transmitted virus make hpv vaccination a " taboo " topic for many doctors			1
but that 's a hurdle that health providers have to overcome , say cancer experts , if they want to see the encouraging declines in cancer continue			0
" just as it is hard for some patients to talk about anal disease or their kids having sex , it 's equally hard for some providers to talk about it , " says @entity124			0
" i talk about it every day , and sometimes it is still difficult for me to approach some patients who i know have a degree of opposition to this type of conversation			0
" @entity50 : gardasil : no serious health concerns linked with hpv vaccine the annual report is a collaboration between researchers at the @entity61 , the @entity179 , the @entity180 , and the @entity181			1
since 1998 , it has provided a robust picture of the state of cancer in the @entity3 unlike the case with @entity32 - related cancers , the report shows that from 2000 to ' 09 , cancer - death rates overall have been declining , dropping by 1.8 % per year among men , 1.4 % among women and 1.8 % among kids up to the age of 14			1
for both men and women , the declines occurred among some of the most common cancers : lung , prostate , breast , colon and rectum , leukemia , and non-hodgkin lymphoma			1
the cancers with rising death rates included skin , pancreatic and liver cancers for men , while women showed an elevated risk of dying from pancreatic , liver cancer and uterine cancers			2
@entity50 : cancer and foggy thinking : is chemotherapy really the cause ? the rates of new cancers in the same time period showed a more varied pattern			2
while men enjoyed an overall 0.6 % decrease per year on average of new diagnoses , the rates for women remained stable , while children showed a 0.6 % increase per year of new cancer cases			2
the decline for men was driven by fewer cases of prostate , lung , rectum , stomach and larynx cancers ; women showed some of the same drops , but these were offset by increases in thyroid , melanoma , kidney , pancreas , leukemia , liver and uterine cancers			0
" every time we get these reports we argue about whether the death rate decreases because we find so many of these cancers early and we overtreat certain cancers like breast cancer and prostate cancer , " says @entity247			2
overscreening and overtreating cancers have recently become a controversial public - health topic as new analyses question the extensive and repeated screening for certain cancers , like breast and prostate , in light of their potential complications and costs			0
in 2009 , the @entity265 changed its recommendations for mammograms , advising women to wait until they are 50 years old , not 40 , to begin regular testing			0
in 2012 , the task force also advised men to skip routine screening for prostate cancer with the prostate - specific - antigen test altogether unless they have a history of the disease			0
@entity50 : government panel recommends hpv vaccine for boys experts hope that the good and bad news in the report will motivate @entity3 to remain vigilant about cancer 's risk factors , including smoking and too much sun exposure , while taking advantage of ways to protect themselves from tumors , like getting vaccinated against @entity32			1
" the report does a great job of raising this awareness to the public , showing that we are doing our job			0
but we still have more to do			0
just as in other diseases where vaccination has eradicated some , we can still make strides in this disease as well , " says @entity124			0

cancer rates dropping , but not for all tumor types			2

an annual report shows lower cancer rates for the most common cancers
a vaccine against @entity32 strains that can trigger cancer was approved in 2006
in 2010 , only 32 % of girls 13 through 17 received all three vaccine doses
controversy about the vaccine means it can be a taboo topic for doctors
