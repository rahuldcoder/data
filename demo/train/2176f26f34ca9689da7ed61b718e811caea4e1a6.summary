-- your phone 's confiscated			1
you 're going to prison			1
but do n't worry , it 's just for lunch			1
the @entity7 opened its third restaurant this week inside @entity9 in south @entity10			1
the meals are cooked and served by actual prisoners at restaurants located inside prison walls as part of a training and qualification program to help them prepare for life on the outside			1
the venue is the third to open under the scheme , joining enterprises at @entity24 in @entity25 and @entity26 in @entity27			1
the prison restaurants are open to the public from monday to friday , for breakfast and lunch			1
" @entity33 at @entity9 is n't simply a new restaurant opening in @entity10 , " says @entity32 , chief executive at @entity33			1
" we 're offering a credible solution to a major skills shortage within the industry as well as tackling the problem of re-offending			1
" the new @entity10 restaurant will serve a compact menu of upscale @entity43 food			1
there are also five meeting rooms for working lunches for up to 24 people			1
guest treatment the career history of the chefs and the prison environs are n't the only unique traits			1
booking at one of the @entity55 must be done at least 48 hours in advance and guests must be 18 years or older			2
passports or other form of @entity60 is needed to gain entry , and phones , cameras , large bags , laptops and sharp items are prohibited			2
you 're not even allowed to bring in more than $ 80 in cash -- payment for the meal is done by check or prearranged invoice			2
you 'll have your fingerprints and photo taken and may be subject to " routine searching			2
" " this would be similar to what you might expect in an airport , " the guidelines and security procedures state			1
the heavy rules apparently are n't putting people off			2
some 18,000 people ate at @entity85 in @entity24 and @entity26 last year , according to the organization , paying around $ 35 per head for three courses and a coffee			2
how it works the charity started in 2009 as the brainchild of @entity93 , previously a chef at the @entity96 restaurant in @entity97 , @entity10 ( closed since 2008 )			2
he 's now the brand and training director for the project			2
@entity26 is a category b prison ( in the @entity103 , category a prisons are most secure , category @entity105 facilities are " open prisons " ) , and as such requires special measures			1
diners need to be approved in advance by the @entity112 , the cutlery is plastic and no alcohol is served			1
in almost every other respect , it 's a restaurant comparable to any other in @entity10			2
@entity9 is a category c prison while @entity24 is a category @entity119 the restaurant at @entity24 is attached to the prison , rather than within its walls			1
chefs and servers involved in these projects are all prisoners with between six and 18 months of their sentences remaining			2
trainees work full - time -- a 40 - hour week -- studying toward nationally recognized @entity129 ( @entity130 ) in food preparation , front - of - house service and industrial cleaning , before returning to their cells in the evening			2
the @entity9 addition is the third of what will eventually be 10 prison restaurants across the @entity103 within the next three years			1
" the @entity7 , in partnership with @entity140 , plans to have 10 training sites in operation across the prison estate by 2017 , " says @entity32			1
so far they 're working			2
according to the december 2012 edition of @entity148 , in 2011 12.5 % of graduates of @entity33 program re-offended			0
the national average was 47 %			0
but it 's not cheap			0
@entity151 raised more than Â £ 300,000 ( $ 500,000 ) in private funding to start the project			0
and it 's not yet profitable			0
" each @entity33 restaurant operates at a loss of circa Â £ 150,000 ( $ 250,000 ) per year due to them being training restaurants and the mentoring work which is provided to the graduates for six to 12 months after their release , " says @entity32			0
" we receive financial support from philanthropic individuals , hmps and the government			0
" this , and the money from people dining in the restaurant and the purchasing of @entity33 products , helps to reduce the deficit			1
" the food locally grown and sourced ingredients are used whenever possible			0
the meats at @entity9 come from a local butcher , for example , while @entity178 supplies many of the vegetables used in the project from its own farm			0
prisoners at @entity26 also get to apply to work toward an nvq in @entity183 and @entity184			0
dishes are contemporary and @entity43 in provenance , and the menu changes every quarter or for special events			0
sample dishes for @entity9 include hot crab and smoked mackerel pancake rolls , herb crusted pork chops and woodland wild mushroom and artichoke lasagne			0
further rehabilitation projects @entity199 columnist and convicted murderer @entity198 supports the charity			0
@entity198 was released in 2004 after serving 20 years of a life sentence			0
" for me , there can never be enough rehabilitative initiatives in our prisons			1
rehabilitation means fewer potential victims of released prisoners , " he tells @entity0 via email			0
" it 's just a shame the government relies on charities such as @entity33 to provide those initiatives			0
" @entity33 restaurants vastly increase the likelihood that those who take part will discover , or rediscover , the satisfaction of having a skill to provide a service that makes them feel good about themselves			0
" there are other charity restaurant schemes in the @entity103			1
in 2002 , @entity226 opened his first @entity227 in @entity10 to train unemployed young people as apprentice chefs			0
fifteen restaurants have subsequently opened in @entity231 and @entity232			0
the @entity233 seeks to help those who have experienced or are at risk of homelessness in @entity10			0
but for some , the cost of running these schemes is too high			0
the @entity239 , opened in @entity10 in 2004 , closed in 2012 as the charity behind the project went into administration			0
the @entity7 has no plans to expand beyond the @entity103			1
the @entity55 ( @entity9 , @entity24 and @entity178 ) are available for booking at @entity33 .			0

@entity245 is third and latest prison dining experience to open in @entity103
@entity7 plans to open another seven across @entity103 prisons
diners undergo *stringent* security checks , including fingerprinting and possible *pat* downs
