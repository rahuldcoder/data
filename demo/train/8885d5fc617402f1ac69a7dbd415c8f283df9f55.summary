-- when spanish - language network @entity3 blasted the @entity5 for its glaring lack of ethnic diversity among the four presidential and vice presidential debate moderators , champions of diversity applauded the network 's willingness to challenge the status quo			1
in many ways , @entity3 was echoing the famous words written in the first edition of the nation 's first black newspaper , @entity16 , founded by @entity18 and @entity19 in 1827 : " we wish to plead our own cause			1
too long have others spoken for us			0
" there is no doubt that choosing a woman to moderate a presidential debate for the first time in 20 years -- @entity0 's @entity27 -- is long overdue			1
but with this nation quickly becoming a majority - minority country , the perspective , background and interests of those asking the questions is seriously important			1
part of the diversity problem with the presidential moderators also stems from the lack of diversity in the media , especially in the power positions of executives , show hosts and executive producers			1
and our nation 's media is quick to examine another industry 's shortcomings and pay only lip service to its own			1
it 's great that after @entity3 's critique , president @entity53 and @entity54 decided to participate individually in an issues forum hosted by the network 's anchors , @entity59 and @entity60			1
to all of the haters who are seething right now -- readying their e-mails and composing comments such as " why ca n't we all just be @entity66 ? " and " you 're race - baiting with this column " -- please , pipe down and listen for a change , to understand the nuances of this issue			2
in the media , whenever we say " mainstream , " we might as well be honest and admit that means white			1
i have heard cable and broadcast executives speak in those terms for years , and trust me , when they are thinking about the dominant audience , it means white			2
that 's why when anyone is talking about media that targets demographics other than white , you 'll hear the phrase " ethnic media			1
" for newspapers targeting @entity66 , you 'll hear " the black press			2
" what we have to acknowledge is that the moderator 's background , upbringing , experiences and where he or she grew up , all play a crucial role in what questions are asked			1
if you take people who grew up in a nearly all - white environment in the suburbs and they have spent their adulthood in similar surroundings , their outlook on life and the issues wo n't be the same as those who grew up in a nearly all - white rural environment			1
their education , health and economic concerns likely will be drastically different			2
the same goes for someone is @entity66 , @entity117 , @entity119 or @entity118			0
our ethnicity should n't be divisive ; our diversity is what makes us unique , and that means embracing it			0
that ethnic and regional perspective is also important in other ways			2
for instance , conservatives always lament the " @entity130 liberals " who work for major media companies			0
but the truth is that the notion of what 's important in @entity136 and @entity137 is much the same in conservative outlets as it is in liberal outlets in those cities			2
for years , i 've felt out of place as a native @entity143 within these media circles			1
how i view the issues is different from who decides the top news of the day in places such as @entity137 or @entity136			0
add on that i 'm african - american , and my outlook varies a great deal from a lot of tv newsbookers , producers , executive producers , hosts , editorial opinion page editors and national political correspondents			0
my background plays a role in the way i view the world , and that comes across based on the issues i choose to highlight and discuss			0
for example , when i 'm on @entity0 's " starting point with @entity165 , " and we 're choosing a story of the day in the newspaper , i purposely do n't choose anything from the @entity171 , @entity172 , the @entity173 or any @entity137 papers			0
why ? because those are the daily papers read by most folks in the media			0
why do i want to reinforce the narrative that those papers decide what 's most important ? i 'll choose to grab something in the @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , the @entity185 , @entity186 ( @entity187 ) or websites , magazines and blogs produced for ethnic audiences to spread the love and expand the universe of what is news			1
these debates should be the same			0
there should be ethnic and gender diversity among the moderators			1
who they are and the questions they ask should be broad in scope , but also specific to various groups that make up the @entity206			0
let 's stop asking questions only about the middle class or the nation 's rich			2
can someone actually mention the poor in this country , which is made of up people of all ethnic groups ? can we hear the candidates talk about why the @entity206 has more prisoners than any other nation in the world and why blacks and @entity222 make up a disproportionate number of them ? is racial profiling too provocative to be put on the table ? is the education achievement gap too toxic to bring up ? how about health disparities between rural and city folk , and whites , blacks and @entity222 ? sorry to say , if your questioners are all white , most of these questions wo n't be on their index cards			1
i do n't want to hear a presidential or vice-presidential candidate 's favorite tv show , food , hobby or most embarrassing thing they 've ever done			0
such silly questions should be barred forever			0
but we can have debates that are not just substantive , but culturally relevant			0
the point is n't about a gotcha question or trying to get someone to slip up			0
it 's simply recognizing that the next president and vice president of the @entity206 will represent one nation , 50 states and 300 million people of many hues , shapes and perspectives			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity260 .			2

@entity262 - language @entity3 blasted lack of diversity among debate moderators
@entity260 : ethnic diversity is important because what is asked depends on who asks it
@entity260 says as a black , native @entity143 , his concerns differ from mainstream white media 's
we need new questions about the poor , prisons , other issues that never crop up , he says
