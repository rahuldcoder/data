-- it 's probably good that i 'm not rich			1
@entity4 , it seems to me , sends people in one of three directions : @entity8 cites the increase in intelligent , witty , creative women as a reason she can be cheerful			1
it accelerates an innate inclination to be generous , or it accelerates a kamikaze inclination to party with the @entity15 , or it sucks away your sense of purpose and produces a desperate need to eat nothing but those little white cheddar @entity22 - it crackers while staring blankly at an endless cycle of " @entity25 " reruns			1
i like to think that if i were rich , i 'd be the kind of person who looks at the world and decides to fund cancer research and build schools and feed the hungry , and save whoever needs saving , but there 's an excellent chance i 'd be the kind of person who looks at the world and decides never to get out of bed again			1
in fact , despite my very real ( and utterly inconvenient ) need to earn a living , i 'm still the kind of person who leans toward the whole @entity43 - it thing			1
to begin with , i have a slight tendency toward depression ( think @entity48 listening to a freshly downloaded acoustic set from @entity50 )			1
and when this particular brain chemistry is confronted with the incredibly unsettling knowledge that people no longer work like dogs to get ahead , they work like dogs just to stay where they are , well , a girl starts needing a few good reasons to get up , put on a little lipstick , and venture out			1
but it 's no secret that it 's not pretty out there			2
food prices are soaring , the housing market is plummeting , the middle class is disappearing , the climate is changing , and @entity69 is touring			2
this is all the more reason to keep a soothing thought or two close at hand			1
someday soon , i promise , we can sit down together and come up with a breathtaking bucket list that finally commits us to skydiving with @entity75 just as we 've secretly prayed we would , but today i 'm offering a different kind of list			2
@entity0 : how you ( yes , you ! ) should live your life good reasons to put on a little lipstick and venture out ( or at least put on clean pajamas and raise your window shade a couple of inches ) : junior high is just one long daisy chain of nonstop mean , and you have officially survived it			1
that 's right , my friend , you may have to face locusts , drought , and @entity95 , but you can now go forth secure in the understanding that seventh grade is over			1
you get to wake up each and every morning without worrying that @entity99 got the same @entity101 boots as you			2
you will never have to read " @entity107 , " be groped by a 13 - year - old reeking of his father 's @entity103 , or feather your bangs again			1
the enormity of this revelation must not be underestimated			2
my delightfully decadent friend @entity112 recently discovered a recipe for bacon ice cream ( @entity115 ) , and get this -- the first step involves candying the bacon ! let 's all take a moment of hushed reverence to contemplate this			1
@entity0 : five friends every woman should have first came the polio vaccine , then @entity125 made a giant leap for mankind , and today we actually have the technology to combine pork fat with butter fat , salty with sweet , crunchy with creamy			2
i firmly believe that what chicken soup does for the common cold , bacon ice cream will one day do for the premenstrual woman			1
we can now have our scoop of bacon ice cream and wear a clingy @entity142 jersey wrap dress too			1
intelligent , witty , creative women appear to be on the rise			2
i like men so much that i even had a baby with one of ' em , but the baby is now 5 , and it 's nice to be able to show her some brilliantly talented females -- @entity154 ( @entity156 host ) , @entity157 ( playwright , producer , actress , " @entity161 " ) , @entity162 ( her debut novel , " @entity163 " , hits stores in january , and it 's an absolute knockout ) -- who are very good at what they do			2
as role models go , @entity167 only takes a mom so far			2
besides , check out @entity167 's expressionless little brow -- i 'm pretty sure it 's coursing with @entity172			0
ordinarily , i would not include houseguests on my list of bright spots , but @entity176 , the dog i am currently babysitting , is causing me to rethink my position			0
@entity176 suffers from a chronic greeting disorder that manifests itself as follows : i leave the room for 10 , maybe 12 seconds			0
upon reentry , @entity176 welcomes me with a level of enthusiasm usually reserved for soldiers returning from three years in a pow camp -- a one - dog mariachi band of pure , unmitigated joy			0
unless my boyfriend and our daughter sense that i 'm carrying a pizza , my return from nine or 10 hours at the office rarely merits more than a mumbled " they never came to fix the dishwasher			0
" there 's something to be said for a bit of good old - fashioned , uncomplicated affection , even when it comes from a shedding , slightly incontinent 14 - year - old beagle			0
@entity204 is either dead or eating onion rings , but @entity206 is alive and mesmerizing every week on " @entity207			1
" you know those little stain remover pens that everybody keeps in their bags and desk drawers ? i could n't care less about them			0
life is inherently messy , and i accept the odd spot of cranberry juice as part of @entity221 's great plan for me and the vast majority of my t - shirts			0
but the other night at our local diner when @entity227 accidentally catapulted her chocolate milk shake across our booth , there was my pal @entity230 , dry cleaner 's pen , ice water , and paper napkins at the ready			1
@entity235 is just one of those intuitive , insightful , ironic , wildly generous , deeply adorable women who , despite working two jobs , is quietly , unequivocally there for the people she loves			0
if you need a complex carbohydrate , she 's got the whole grain pasta salad			0
if you need a sock puppet , she 's got the glue gun			0
if you need a boost , she 's got the ceramic vase brimming with sunflowers			0
the woman once went on vacation , and i was absolutely bereft			0
two weeks without @entity250 feels like a house without books			0
you see , @entity110 , bacon ice cream , and all the mad men in the world do n't change the hard truth that plans frequently fail and dreams have been known to dim			1
but come the morning , there are your friends offering sweet salvation and good gossip and the occasional glass of @entity264 with lunch			0
if ever there was a reason for hope , i think maybe that 's it			1
