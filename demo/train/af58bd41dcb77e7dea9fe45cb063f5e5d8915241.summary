-- the @entity1 is supposed to be the most exciting in the world -- but there 's something a little too predictable about it all this season			1
a decade ago , @entity6 won the title without losing a single game and was hailed as ' invincible ' as it triumphed in 26 of its 38 fixtures			2
now , 10 years later , there is a feeling that a new generation of invincible players are ready to emerge -- and they are wearing the blue of @entity16			2
another victory on wednesday night , this time against @entity17 , takes @entity16 's unbeaten run to 14 league games and 21 in all competitions this season			1
@entity24 's side sit six points clear at the top of the table ahead of @entity28 , the defending champion			1
ostensibly , this is a two - horse race with @entity31 and @entity6 already well off the pace and @entity33 enduring a dismal start to the campaign			2
city , 4 - 1 winners at @entity38 courtesy of another couple of goals from the irrepressible @entity41 , are still in the hunt , but there is something about this @entity16 side which makes it look so imperious			1
already through to the last - 16 of the @entity47 and the quarterfinal of the @entity49 , @entity24 has downplayed his side 's chances of winning the quadruple before it enters the @entity53 in january			1
while such an achievement would be a stupendous achievement , the immediate question of securing the league title appears slightly more realistic			0
a 3 - 0 victory over @entity58 rival @entity17 was achieved with minimum fuss and the usual efficiency as @entity16 recovered from the surprise of only managing a goalless draw at @entity38 last weekend			2
" we played against a very good team and they showed that during some periods in the game , " @entity24 told the @entity65			0
" they started better than us and should have scored before us , but after our first goal our team became more stable and confident and we controlled the game			0
" i 'm really happy with the points , performance and spirit of the players			0
it 's too heavy a result , though , for @entity17			0
" there is nothing more appetizing to a @entity16 team than the visit of @entity17 -- a team which folds as soon as someone inside @entity85 as much as sneezes			0
@entity17 's last win at @entity16 was back in 1990 and in the previous 57 meetings between the two sides , @entity17 had managed just five victories			1
so even when the visiting side made a strong start to the contest and @entity95 hit the crossbar , there were few imagining anything other than a @entity16 victory			1
they were to be proved correct of course			0
@entity101 and @entity102 both scored both the interval before @entity104 added a third to seal the points			0
@entity17 will not be the last team to be given a beating by @entity16 this season , this was the 11th time @entity24 's side have tasted success in 14 league games			1
city slickers @entity16 's main challenge looks set to come from @entity28 which breezed to victory at @entity38 , a place where it has struggled in the past			1
@entity28 remained in touch at the top after coming from behind to win at @entity38 with @entity41 playing a starring role yet again			2
the @entity122 striker scored twice with @entity123 and @entity124 also on target after @entity38 had taken a surprise lead			0
@entity41 , who has now scored 66 @entity1 goals in 101 appearances , has managed 14 so far this season			2
elsewhere , @entity6 grabbed a dramatic late winner to see off @entity131 1 - 0			1
@entity132 netted in the 89th minute to fire @entity6 to within two points of the @entity47 places			0
" it was a difficult game against a good side but we deserved to win , it was a victory of patience and intelligence and we kept our structure well , " @entity135 , the @entity6 manager , told the @entity65			1
" we were jaded physically but @entity132 can dig deep and has such desire and a will to win , he still finds that resource to get you something special			0
" in the night 's other game , @entity147 was held to a 1 - 1 draw by @entity150 .			0

@entity16 makes it 14 games unbeaten in @entity1
