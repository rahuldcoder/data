when they 've met at grand slams recently , @entity0 and @entity1 have n't disappointed			1
the two combined to orchestrate another great spectacle at the @entity7 and this time it was world @entity8 who outlasted the defending champion to book his spot in the final			1
last year , @entity1 had downed @entity0 9 - 7 in the fifth set when the pair met in the quarterfinals in @entity16 en route to breaking the stranglehold of tennis ' @entity20 but the @entity21 prevailed friday 7 - 6 ( 1 ) 3 - 6 6 - 4 4 - 6 6 - 0 in a match that had more plot twists than a low - budget horror movie			1
when @entity0 clinched the hard fought affair -- it was the fourth straight time the pair went to five sets at a grand slam -- he joined @entity30 and @entity31 as the only men in the @entity33 to make five finals in @entity16			1
@entity0 improved to 9 - 0 in semifinals and finals at the @entity7 and that includes three wins over his opponent in the final , @entity39			1
on thursday , @entity39 won an ill - tempered clash against @entity42 that landed the @entity44 's fiancee in hot water			1
@entity0 's streak appeared to be in jeopardy as the fifth set began , however			1
with the @entity21 creaking , @entity1 erred on break point in the first game when he sent a routine backhand long			1
@entity0 took advantage of a deflated @entity1 to break in the next game and did n't look back			1
while the duo combined to make 118 unforced errors -- to go along with only 69 winners -- there was drama aplenty and still some brilliant shot - making			0
" describe the match ? strange , " @entity1 told reporters			1
@entity1 needed eye drops to rectify an issue in the first set and @entity0 had to be told by the chair umpire that he won the third set , such was his level of concentration			1
@entity0 blew a break lead in the fourth and @entity1 hit one of the shots of the tournament -- a backhand drop volley -- to save a break point later in the fourth			1
on other occasions , he drew gasps from the crowd by crushing his flat , one - handed backhand			0
whereas @entity0 looked solid on his serve in his previous five matches , @entity1 broke him five times			1
but the @entity82 not only lost his first tiebreak of the tournament -- having previously gone 5 - 0 -- he imploded and was thumped 7 - 1			2
" it was very emotional , very tense , as it always is against a top player in the semifinals of a grand slam , " @entity0 told reporters			2
" of course , judging by the last two matches we played here ... we could expect something like that , a five - setter			0
so the battle was great			0
" it was no different this year from the previous two years in terms of , you know , fighting from both sides			0
the only difference was that the fifth set went completely my way			0
" but , again , it was a tight first opening game of the fifth set where he had some break point opportunities , missed an easy ball			0
" despite the topsy - turvy nature of the semifinal , @entity0 claimed he was content with his form ahead of the final against @entity39 , his longtime friend and tennis rival			1
" i think i have much more positive things to reflect on in my game and then all the matches that i played so far in the tournament than the negative , " @entity0 said			2
" i 'm in the finals			0
at the end of the day , that 's why i 'm here , you know , to try to get far in the tournament			2
" getting to the finals in any way possible is a great achievement			0
i 'm going to try to use that for build up of the confidence for finals			0
" his record against @entity39 in @entity130 -- he defeated the sixth seed in the 2011 and 2013 finals -- works in @entity0 's favor			1
but then , in both of @entity39 's grand slam successes , he beat @entity8 in the final			1
" he 's been playing some great tennis these couple weeks , " said @entity0			1
" from my side , it 's going to be necessary to perform at my best and play the best match of the tournament if i want to win			2
" obviously it 's finals			2
there 's no clear favorite			2
but as you mentioned , the record i have in finals against him here in @entity130 , we played couple times , can serve maybe as a slight mental edge			0
" i do n't think he 's going to feel that on the court			0
i 'm sure he 's going to be very motivated to win his first title here			0
i 'm going to , of course , give my best that that does n't happen			0
" cause for concern for @entity161 ? like @entity0 , @entity161 has never tasted defeat at the @entity7 once she 's progressed past the quarterfinals			1
the world no. 1 holds a 16 - 2 record against her foe in saturday 's women 's final , @entity167			1
but the 18 - time grand slam winner cut short a first practice session friday because she was unwell			2
she went on to practice later			0
" i had a false start ( this morning ) , " @entity161 said in a statement			2
" i was n't feeling really well			0
i 've been sick with a cold all week and i got better , then i got worse this morning			0
" i just had to go back ( to the hotel ) , relax and take a nap , rejuvenate my body			0
i rescheduled practice for this afternoon			0
it went well ... i felt better			0
" if the second - ranked @entity167 snaps her 15 - match losing streak against @entity161 , she would claim a first major outside @entity183 in seven years .			2

@entity0 makes the @entity7 final
@entity21 defeats @entity1 in five sets in @entity16
the world no. 1 faces @entity39 on *sunday*
an ill @entity161 cuts short practice ahead of women 's final
