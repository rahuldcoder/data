" according to the @entity1 , to pander is to : " provide gratification for others ' desires			0
" so is that what @entity6 and @entity7 are doing with @entity10 voters ? sen. @entity6 has said the issue of immigration would be a top priority for him as president			1
if you follow coverage of their speeches at three @entity21 events -- the @entity22 , the @entity23 and @entity24 -- the answer would be yes			1
why ? because the two candidates are talking about making immigration reform a priority if they reach the @entity29 , and to make it there , they know the @entity10 vote can have a great impact			1
more than 9 million hispanics are expected to vote on november 4th			2
they traditionally favor @entity34 , but many have supported republicans in key races			0
in 2004 , for example , 40 percent of the @entity21 vote went to president @entity40 -- so going after them makes political sense			1
do @entity21 care about immigration reform ? yes , they do			1
but it 's not the only issue that concerns them			0
see where the candidates stand on immigration they , too , pay more than $ 4 for a gallon of gas , and are worried about the economy , foreclosures , the war in @entity54 and access to health care and education			1
but the debate on immigration has motivated many to apply for citizenship and many others to register to vote			2
@entity21 are n't a monolithic group as many seem to believe			2
some families go back six or seven generations			0
@entity67 are @entity69 citizens by birth			0
@entity71 can stay if they make it to @entity69 soil			0
latinos from all over @entity75 come by plane			0
surprisingly , a majority of @entity21 voters show a deep interest in immigration reform , even though it would n't benefit them directly because they are @entity69 citizens			1
they believe reform would help in a community that shares a common language , even though it has many differences			0
they are n't na√Øve and wo n't be swayed with tall tales			0
but to pander has a negative connotation and the concept seems highlighted when it refers to @entity21 , the largest - and fastest - growing minority in the nation			1
this electorate is familiar with politicians making promises they do n't always keep -- and surely will see that @entity6 favors border security before immigration reform , a reform he put his name on at great cost			1
they are aware of the need to learn @entity103 in order to succeed , and not necessarily for every child to learn @entity106 as @entity7 suggested			0
that could fuel fears about @entity10 influence , and spur some to use that fear to score political points			2
in this case , the approach goes in two directions			0
it can be seen as pandering to a specific group for political gain , but it can also be portrayed as a challenge to @entity21			1
with greater clout comes higher responsibility ; it means not only registering to vote , but actually doing it on @entity123 , making those numbers count , showing that @entity74 are more than a group with great potential			2
is pandering to @entity21 any different from pandering to other groups ? why is n't there a similar outcry when candidates address the @entity132 on the future of @entity134 ? or the @entity135 ? is n't that pandering ? @entity21 are coming of political age , and probably face a dilemma			1
but which is better -- being pandered to , or ignored ? and no , it 's not a trick question .			0

candidates talk about immigration reform at @entity21 events
@entity21 care about a lot of other issues , says @entity149
latinos : the largest and fastest growing minority in the nation
candidates ' so - called pandering to @entity74 shows the power of the @entity10 vote
