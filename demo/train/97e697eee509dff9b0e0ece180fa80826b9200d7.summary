-- long before he was accused of murder , @entity1 was toasted the world over for his triumph over a disability			1
his lightning running speed -- which took him all the way to the @entity8 despite using carbon legs -- attracted sponsorships worth millions			2
but as his murder trial dragged on , his popularity plummeted and sponsors abruptly dropped him			1
now that a judge has found him guilty of negligent homicide , what 's next for the man known as the @entity1 ? when will he be sentenced ? judge @entity18 granted him bail friday , and set sentencing for october 13			1
@entity21 is not a one - day affair in @entity23			2
the prosecution wanted him held without bail , saying he sold his immovable assets , and that makes him a flight risk			2
will he return to competitive running ? though he has been running during the trial , he has not been involved in any competitions			2
he 's said he runs because it relaxes him and gets his mind off things			1
it 's unclear if he will return to competitive running			1
he is known to be a fierce , passionate competitor -- driven by a need for speed and adrenaline			2
has he reached out to @entity43 's family ? @entity1 says he 's tried to , but her family is not ready to talk to him			1
her mother , @entity46 , has confirmed that			2
during the trial , he tried to reach out to them , her mother said			0
@entity1 ' sister , @entity51 , also tried to pass a note to @entity43 , but she shunned it			1
" it wo n't bring my daughter back , " she told the @entity54			0
" we just want to know the truth			0
" on friday , the second day of the verdict , @entity1 made another attempt at greeting her relatives in court			1
what about his sports endorsements ? @entity1 had coveted endorsements both overseas and in his home country			1
with his negligent homicide conviction , they probably wo n't be coming back			0
his most prominent sponsor was @entity70 , a deal reportedly worth about $ 2 million and signed in 2012			0
but it also turned into a liability during his murder trial			0
@entity70 's ad referred to him as " the bullet in the chamber , " words you do n't want associated with you when you 're accused of shooting your girlfriend to death			1
@entity70 dropped him in february of last year			0
others followed suit , including @entity84			0
the @entity23 tv channel had featured him in an ad campaign			0
how much time is he facing ? there 's no legal maximum ( or minimum ) sentence for culpable homicide , said @entity92 , a @entity0 legal analyst			1
a typical sentence is five to eight years			0
but it is a principle of @entity23 law that the sentence should be tailored to the culprit as a whole person , as opposed to the crime			0
that makes predicting a sentence difficult			0
will he get special treatment in prison ? if observation is anything to go by , the double amputee may be put in the same area as the general population -- even blind prisoners are placed with sighted prisoners in @entity23			0
but , ahead of his release on bail last year , the @entity112 said the athlete benefited from special privileges , adding that his family could visit him outside visiting hours , unlike relatives of other inmates			1
can both sides appeal ? @entity1 can appeal the verdict or the sentence , potentially to the supreme court and even eventually to @entity23 's constitutional court			1
but the state can appeal only if it believes the judge has misinterpreted the law in reaching her verdict			0
the right to appeal depends on whether , based on the facts of the case , the initial judge or magistrate believes a different court could possibly reach a different verdict			0
@entity23 's highest court , known as the constitutional court , was once just for cases regarding constitutional matters , but a recent act of parliament broadened its responsibilities			1
@entity0 's @entity144 and @entity145 contributed to this report .			2

@entity1 has reached out to @entity43 's family
his sponsors cut ties with him after the killing
