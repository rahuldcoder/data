@entity0 , @entity1 -- i am attempting to journey from @entity5 to @entity5 via the world , using just a rowing boat , a bike and a kayak			1
i write from @entity1 -- where i am eight months and 11000 miles in to this 2.5 year expedition , having cycled and kayaked all the way here			1
the next phase is a solo row across the @entity14			1
i set out from the east coast of @entity1 in the spring , bound for the @entity16 and @entity17 , where i hope to arrive some five or six months later			1
from the coast i will pick up my bike once more and cycle across the continent to the edge of the @entity24 , ready for the final row home to the @entity26			1
i am doing it out of curiosity , for the challenge and for the perspective of traveling so slowly across landscapes and so close to nature			1
the idea came about during my solo row across the @entity35 in 2009 -- i loved tracing the line across a vast swathe of blue and feeling like i was a part of the ocean			2
i wanted to spend more time at sea and i wanted to experience the people and green parts of our globe too			2
one of my aims is to share the journey as i go -- via my website and live links with schools			2
it has been wonderful to link up live into school groups over the satellite phone and answer their questions on the project -- such an exciting thing for both of us , i think			2
besides getting to the start of the project ( logistically , financially , emotionally it was huge ) , the greatest challenge has been the five week journey from the edge of @entity65 to the top of @entity1 's main island , @entity0			2
i was tired and under pressure from various angles -- weather , visas expiring and kit failures			2
the sudden change from biking solo for months on end to kayaking with my camerawoman for the first time in months was exhausting for mind and body			1
language has been a challenge on the way too -- it can often lead to some fun games trying to understand people ! then there is the management of everything off the bike or out of the boat too -- my team , inputting into the logistics , planning ahead or raising more funding			1
if only it was all as simple as riding a bike or paddling a boat			1
the best story from the journey so far has been that of @entity99 -- a young @entity101 guy who joined me on my cycle across his country after meeting me in a petrol station			2
he had never cycled more than 10 km and did n't even own a bike			1
35 days later we pedaled into @entity107 together after the most extraordinary adventures - through desert , over mountains and meeting some interesting characters along the way			1
we both grew in those 4000 km -- it was wonderful			0
another highlight for me was sitting just off the beach on @entity116 , watching a brown bear feeding along the tide lines			0
it was one of the most profound moments watching wildlife i have ever had			0
the scariest moment , besides all the near misses on the road with trucks and traffic , was the day i nearly peed on a snake			0
i turned to walk out of the bushes and a snake jumped clear off the ground on the attack			0
there were so many snakes in @entity134 -- i love to see them when i know they are there but those surprising encounters made my pulse race ! the most poignant and moving story so far is that of @entity1 's @entity143 coast -- much of it destroyed by the major earthquake and ensuing tsunami of march this year			1
i am heading up there to volunteer for a week shortly			0
the clean up operation there will take many years and there will be lingering scars forever			0
logistically it is a massive project -- the complexity of getting kit and people all over the world to match up with my various stages , and often in remote countries has been challenging , to say the least			1
my team and i are learning all the time and i for one am looking forward to the ocean and the simplicity of it			0
if something breaks i have to deal with it , whereas on land life can get quite complicated at times , because of borders , needing to find food and shelter , people etc. training before i came away was mostly focused on strength and conditioning so that my body was as prepared as possible for the trials of the journey			0
it worked to an extent but i am still undergoing recovery physio to fix some of the issues i racked up over the first phase of the journey			0
i also undertook some bike journeys and made my first big crossing by kayak			1
i am now focused on training for the ocean ahead and getting all the systems in place to make it as successful as possible			0
it has been an incredible journey so far , often defined by the people i have met and our reactions to each other			0
i am excited about the phases ahead , though keen to have some down time over the @entity196 period too			0
it has been a huge effort to get this far and i am grateful for all those who have helped me do so .			0
