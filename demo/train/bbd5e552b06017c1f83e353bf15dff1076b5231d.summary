-- authorities have shut down a @entity4 food processing plant , saying it was contaminated by bacteria linked to the deaths of four people , state health officials said			1
the @entity8 on wednesday ordered @entity9 and @entity10 to immediately stop processing food and recall all products shipped from its @entity14 plant since january			2
this comes after state laboratory results showed listeria monocytogenes , a bacteria that can cause severe illness , in chopped celery at the plant			2
four people died after contracting listeriosis after consuming celery that had been processed at the @entity25 plant , said @entity26 , a department spokeswoman			1
state health authorities came to this determination while investigating 10 cases in which people with serious underlying health problems contracted listeriosis over an 8 - month period			2
six of those cases -- in @entity37 , @entity38 and @entity40 counties -- were linked to chopped celery processed at the @entity25 plant , the state health services department said			1
four of those people died , as did one other person who authorities believe got listeriosis from another source not connected with @entity25 products			1
@entity25 , however , sharply questioned the state 's findings and strongly denied wrongdoing , saying it has had " an excellent record of safety and health " over the past three years			1
its president said outside tests " directly contradict " the state 's conclusion			2
" the independent testing shows our produce to be absolutely safe , and we are aggressively fighting the state 's erroneous findings , " said @entity59 , president of @entity25			1
state health inspectors said they believe the bacteria found in the chopped celery may have contaminated other products at the company 's plant			1
@entity25 processes a wide variety of products -- including three varieties of lettuce , peppers , carrots , cucumbers and various cut - up fruit , as well as salad , fruit and soup mixes , according to the company 's website			1
they are distributed primarily in sealed packages to restaurants , hospitals , schools and other large institutions that serve food			0
besides the bacteria , inspectors found a condensation leak above a food product area , dirt on a food - preparation table , and hand - washing problems at the @entity14 plant , the state health department said			1
the state said that it is contacting distributors , restaurants and others who may have received @entity25 products			2
listeria monocytogenes is a bacterium found in the soil , in water , and in animals that carry it without showing signs they are sick , according to the @entity112			0
it can get into vegetables from soil or manure that is used as fertilizer			0
the strain of bacteria is relatively resilient -- with an incubation period of three to 70 days , @entity26 said -- and some foods can be contaminated after cooking but prior to packaging			0
the bacteria have been tied to listeriosis , which sickens about 2,500 @entity126 and contributes to the death of 500 people annually , the @entity112 reports			0
people with weakened immune systems , including newborns and the elderly , are especially susceptible to listeriosis			0
pregnant women are about 20 times more likely than other adults to contract the disease			0
in august , @entity59 told @entity0 affiliate @entity137 that food - safety measures were not tough enough , saying the @entity139 should be more involved in inspections			1
at the time , the @entity25 president said that his company had never had a high bacteria count or had anything recalled			2
" ultimately , you can get someone very sick , " @entity59 told @entity137 , criticizing city health inspections as insufficient			0
" we 're talking about fresh - cut fruits and vegetables that need to be sanitized			0
" the @entity4 health department is taking the lead in the investigation , with assistance from the @entity139 and the @entity112			0
the state justified its closure of the @entity25 plant , citing @entity4 law that authorizes such actions if conditions pose " an immediate and serious threat to human life or health			1
" " at this point , the order prohibits the plant from reopening without our approval , " said @entity26			0
" we will work with the company about setting up some guidelines before it can [ reopen ]			0
