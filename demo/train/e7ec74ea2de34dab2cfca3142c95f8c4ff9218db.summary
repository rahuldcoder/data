-- vice president @entity1 recently confided a sensational bit of news to the @entity5 magazine : in a 2011 meeting with @entity7 , he had actually told @entity9 's then - prime minister that he had no " soul			1
" even more remarkable was @entity7 's response			2
" and he looked back at me , and he smiled , and he said , ' we understand one another			0
' " many people -- in @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 and even @entity9 -- probably share @entity1 and @entity7 's estimation of the @entity9 president 's spiritual condition			1
in saying @entity7 has no soul , it means he seems to lack both the capacity to feel emotions and to show empathy			2
@entity9 's leader certainly has a long record of inhumanity			2
he was an agent of the @entity31 secret police , a criminal institution with a record that goes back to the purges of @entity35 , a record more bloody than that of the @entity38 @entity39 of @entity41 's @entity40 wrote in " the @entity42 " that there is strong evidence to suggest that @entity7 was in on the plot to bomb two apartment buildings in @entity47 in september 1999 , in which 300 @entity9 citizens were killed and several hundred others were wounded			1
he says the bombings were blamed on @entity52 rebels as a pretext to invade @entity54			0
@entity7 has funded , promoted , supplied and aided and abetted the @entity9 and @entity56 terrorists in eastern @entity16			1
and by invading @entity57 , he created the conditions of war , hatred and fanaticism that led to the destruction of 298 innocent lives aboard @entity64 17 on that day of infamy , july 17			0
who are @entity16 's @entity68 rebels ? is @entity7 evil ? his actions certainly are , if by evil we understand behavior that willfully , consciously and purposely destroys human life			1
perhaps we can call his actions undeniably evil and @entity7 himself " evil enough			1
" evil enough for what ? evil enough for condemnation by people of good will			0
how rebels in @entity16 built up an arsenal capable of reaching the skies if @entity7 is " evil enough , " what are the implications for policy - makers ? first , they should openly state that they condemn @entity7 's behavior			1
because silence implies approval , policy - makers must understand that their moral standing , like that of the countries they represent , is on the line			1
if they refuse to condemn this instance , they effectively surrender the right to condemn any instance of evil			2
second , they should refuse to shake his hand , engage in chitchat , attend photo ops with him and in any way create the impression that they accept his behavior as a socially acceptable			0
@entity112 chancellor @entity111 would not hobnob with a @entity112 neo-nazi ; president @entity114 would not have drinks with the head of the @entity117			2
by extension , neither of them should hobnob with @entity7 at @entity122 soccer games			2
third , policy - makers should avoid doing anything that aids and abets @entity7 's proclivities			0
since those proclivities largely rest on his ability to employ armaments to cause death , any form of assistance to @entity7 's war machine or repressive apparatus is the moral equivalent of supplying barbed wire and bullets to @entity137			2
two examples will illustrate this point			0
the @entity141 - based @entity112 defense company @entity140 is manifestly abetting @entity7 's evildoing by continuing to insist that it has " to meet its contractual obligations with @entity47 and finalize a combat simulation center where up to 30,000 soldiers could be trained annually			1
" since @entity140 signed the contract with @entity9 in 2011 , when @entity7 's record was already on full display to the world , it can not claim ignorance of @entity7 's evil intentions			1
@entity155 's continued determination to supply the @entity7 war machine with two @entity158 - class assault ships is no less of a moral outrage			1
as @entity169 , a former @entity18 representative to the @entity170 , argues , " with the downing of @entity162 17 , it should now be clear to all observers that @entity9 is fully intent on subjugating and intimidating its former @entity31 constituent states and @entity166 allies , and will do so with the most advanced weapons in its inventory			0
" there is no reason to believe that the mistral - class warships , once in the @entity173 , will not also be used in the @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity177 to further increase the pressure on @entity9 's neighbors			0
given its recent history , @entity47 should not be handed another military tool of the @entity158 - class magnitude			0
" this does not mean that morally concerned policy makers should refrain from talking to him entirely			0
as professor @entity186 , an associate of @entity188 's @entity187 , argues in a fascinating paper , " can -- should -- must we negotiate with @entity191 ? " : " if a cruel dictatorship is willing to negotiate security arrangements likely to limit arms competition and make war less likely , democratic governments should engage and seek verifiable arrangements			0
" so , yes , according to this logic , talk to @entity7 about making " war less likely " in eastern @entity16 and talk to him about limiting " arms competition			1
" otherwise , shun him and everything he stands for			0
opinion : are the @entity56 rebels terrorists ? such countries as @entity155 and @entity112 , which have extensive economic relations with @entity9 , face a difficult moral choice			1
they must ask themselves whether @entity7 is evil or evil enough			2
if they decide his killing spree in eastern @entity16 is neither evil nor evil enough , they must explain -- to themselves and to the rest of the world -- just why they believe the destruction of @entity16 , @entity9 , @entity218 , @entity219 and other lives is not a form of evil behavior			1
if , alternatively , @entity7 's behavior strikes them as evil , they must either act on that conviction , in the manner suggested above , or explain to themselves and the rest of the world just why their enhancing @entity7 's war - making proclivities is not wrong			2
@entity232 : @entity9 getting ready to send more powerful weapons into @entity16 ultimately , @entity155 and @entity112 , as well as all countries that aid and abet @entity9 's destructive capabilities , have to decide whether they care more about values or about money			1
dictatorships can answer that question easily : their leaders are indifferent to values			0
prosperous capitalist democracies , and especially prosperous capitalist democracies that are part of a self - styled community of values called the @entity249 , can not take the easy way out and pretend values do not matter			0
in the final analysis , the willingness of @entity155 , @entity112 and all the other states making up the @entity249 to respond to @entity7 's evil doing will determine the moral fate of the @entity249			1
if they sacrifice morality to arms contracts or gas , the @entity249 will have lost its rasion d'etre			0
worse , like @entity7 , it will be without a soul .			0

@entity264 says @entity7 has promoted , supplied @entity9 and @entity56 terrorists
@entity264 : @entity7 was *member* of brutal secret police and behind *invasions* in @entity269 , @entity16
he is evil enough for all to condemn , @entity264 says ; countries ' silence implies approval
@entity264 : @entity155 , @entity112 must end economic ties with @entity9 ; @entity249 must take a moral stand
