-- @entity1 and 16 - time grand slam champion @entity2 have been drawn to meet in the semifinals of the @entity4 -- setting up the likely prospect of a repeat of their classic 2011 clash at @entity4			1
an inspired @entity2 ended @entity1 's unbeaten streak and dashed the @entity11 's chances of the grand slam before losing in the final to @entity14			1
friday 's draw for the second grand slam of the season saw @entity14 in the same half of the draw as fourth seed @entity20 of @entity22 , again setting up the chance of a re-run of 2011			1
@entity25 's @entity14 will be bidding for a record seventh @entity4 title this year and opens against @entity27 while @entity1 also faces @entity29 opposition in @entity30			1
@entity2 must get past @entity32 's @entity31 to earn a potentially tricky second round clash with @entity35 's @entity34			0
big - hitters @entity37 of @entity35 or @entity39 @entity38 could also provide @entity2 with tough obstacles in his section of the draw			2
@entity20 , out of sorts and struggling with injury is drawn to face home hope @entity46 of @entity47 , who beat him at last week 's @entity48			0
the women 's draw has pitted second seed @entity51 and old rival @entity52 in the same quarter and a possible quarterfinal clash			1
@entity51 , yet to win the @entity4 , warmed up by taking the @entity29 @entity4 crown , while @entity52 has claimed titles in @entity56 and @entity57 on the clay			1
but 2002 winner @entity52 has a tough draw and is seeded to meet @entity61 @entity60 in the last 16			2
defending champion @entity62 of @entity63 , beaten by @entity51 in the @entity48 final last weekend , faces @entity66 @entity65 in the first round and could meet 2011 @entity69 winner @entity68 in the quarters			2
but @entity68 will probably have to get past 2010 winner and last year 's runner - up @entity72 to progress that far			0
top seed @entity74 of @entity76 has been paired with @entity29 @entity77 in the first round as she looks to secure her second consecutive grand slam after her @entity80 triumph			0
@entity81 of @entity82 is drawn to face @entity83 in the second round			0
the action starts sunday in the @entity47 capital .			0
