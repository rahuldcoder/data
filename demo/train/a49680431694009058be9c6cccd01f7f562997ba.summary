-- the 1960s are stereotyped in the popular imagination as a decade of " free love " and sexual liberation			0
yet , as late as 1967 , to share a gay relationship in the @entity6 was to risk arrest , imprisonment and life - wrecking public humiliation			2
even after homosexuality in @entity11 and @entity12 was finally decriminalized that summer -- a month after the release of the @entity15 ' " @entity14 " -- gay people in @entity17 would have to wait until 1980 for the same right , and those in @entity20 two more years			2
this week , almost 46 years later , the @entity21 , the lower house of the @entity6 parliament , took another landmark step towards granting full equality to gay people by voting in favor of a bill that would give them the right to marry			1
civil partnerships , which effectively grant those in same - sex relationships the same legal rights as married couples , have been permitted in the @entity6 since 2005			1
tuesday 's vote in @entity35 came at the same time that @entity37 's @entity36 was also debating a government - backed bill to legalize same - sex marriages			2
a key article of the proposed legislation , redefining marriage as an agreement between two people of the opposite or same sex , was passed emphatically , suggesting the bill is likely to eventually become law , even despite a raft of more than 5,000 amendments tabled by the opposition in an apparent effort to delay proceedings			2
gay rights campaigners in @entity35 and @entity54 may have had cause for celebration , but their legislators were hardly ahead of the curve			1
same - sex marriage is already legal in eight @entity61 countries , including the @entity62 and @entity63 , as well as in @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 and some states of @entity68			1
meanwhile , the cause of gay rights in the @entity71 , where nine states and @entity73 have legalized same - sex marriage , received an historic endorsement in president @entity77 's second term inauguration speech in which he declared : " our journey is not complete until our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law -- for if we are truly equal , then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well			1
" opinion : how @entity71 leads the way on gay rights with recent opinion polls in both the @entity6 and @entity37 indicating solid majorities in favor of equal marriage rights for same - sex couples , @entity94 , a spokesperson for the @entity95 , said it appeared to be an issue with the power to appeal to many people 's emotions			1
" we have seen an increasing momentum towards the legalization of equality in marriage , " @entity94 told @entity0			0
" i think if you exchange the word love for marriage you immediately understand why			0
love is a universal experience and in many place love is equated with marriage , so emotionally people come to understand love and marriage in that way			0
" that momentum has also prompted greater international solidarity between groups campaigning for gay rights , according to @entity121 , a spokesman for the @entity6 's @entity123 charity			1
" we work together with organisations worldwide to help challenge homophobia , and we 've provided advice to campaigners in countries like @entity130 and @entity131 , which are looking to learn from the progress we 've made on equality in @entity6 , " @entity121 told @entity0			1
@entity121 said that growing recognition and awareness of the principles of universal human rights through institutions such as the @entity139 and the @entity140 had also served the cause of gay rights campaigners			1
he cited the @entity143 which recognizes the " equal and inalienable rights of all members of the human family			0
" yet campaigners warn that the focus on advances towards gay marriage in @entity152 nations risks distracting attention from more urgent efforts to secure basic human rights for gay people in many regions of the world where homosexuality is still illegal and homophobia is deeply entrenched			1
" when i speak to my colleagues in these places they say , ' we are not concerned about same - sex marriage			1
we want our basic human rights			0
' the right to live safely , to gather with friends , to speak openly			0
these are things that in @entity152 democracies we take for granted , " said @entity94			0
@entity121 also highlights continuing casual homophobia in the @entity6 , citing @entity123 research suggesting more than half of gay , lesbian and bisexual young people have been bullied at school and @entity177 records of 4,200 homophobic hate crimes in @entity11 and @entity12 last year			2
" we 've seen a lot of progress over the last 10 years but clearly there are still very big problems			0
until everybody in society gets over problems with gay people there is still a lot of work to be done , " he said			2
but while gay rights campaigners can increasingly look abroad for inspiration and common cause , their opponents are also mobilizing on an international scale , many of them united by religious faith			1
in his pre-christmas message , pope @entity198 rallied @entity200 to oppose gay marriage by praising comments critical of gay marriage made by @entity204 , the chief rabbi of @entity37 , raising the prospect of an inter-faith alliance , according to many commentators			1
meanwhile in the @entity6 , the new archbishop of canterbury @entity208 used his first public comments as leader of the worldwide @entity11 community to reiterate the @entity11 's concerns			0
opponents of same - sex marriage argue that the equality argument made by gay rights campaigners is a false one and that there are real social risks involved in redefining the notion of marriage in ways broader than the traditional union of man and woman			1
" nobody wants to be seen as anti-equality and the gay rights lobby have been very effective in framing the argument as being one equivalent to ending slavery , " @entity227 , a spokesperson for the @entity229 pressure group , told @entity0			2
@entity227 said that marriage in western society had traditionally been understood as a " conjugal institution with sexual difference at its heart			0
" to allow people of the same sex to marry was to downgrade marriage 's importance by misunderstanding it as simply " a domestic relationship between two people			0
" he also questioned whether public support for gay marriage in the @entity6 and @entity37 was as strong as opinion polls have suggested , arguing that people were confused by the issue			1
he said anti-gay marriage campaigners in the @entity6 had drawn encouragement from their @entity37 counterparts , who have taken to the streets in hundreds of thousands to oppose the government			2
" there has n't been a lot of co-ordinated international action yet but i can see it beginning to emerge , " said @entity227			0
but @entity263 of the @entity6 's @entity265 polling agency said that opposition to gay rights legislation tended to be forgotten as soon as it became law , citing the examples of the @entity6 's 1967 decriminalization of homosexuality and the changing of the law in 2000 to equalize the age of consent for straight and gay sex to 16			1
" history tells us that measures to advance gay rights cease to be controversial almost as soon as they are passed , " said @entity263			2
" ahead of the 1967 legislation ... @entity282 found that more people thought it should remain a criminal act than to legalise it			0
afterwards , mps across the spectrum agreed that there was never the remotest chance to turn back the clock			0
it 's a similar story with the age of consent			0
both times , opponents of reform folded their tents once the law was changed			0

the @entity6 this week took another landmark step towards granting full equality to gay people
same - sex marriage is already legal in eight @entity61 countries
campaigners warn that advancing gay marriage in the @entity307 risks distracting attention from more urgent rights issues
