-- @entity2 prince @entity1 has called on the @entity3 to drop reported plans to block social media platforms , describing the action -- if implemented -- as a " losing war			1
" the prince 's words appear to refer to proposals thought to be under consideration by @entity2 officials for tighter controls on social media , including steps that would mean @entity17 users could be identified			1
@entity18 : can @entity17 really change @entity2 ? " @entity20 , social media is a tool for the people to make the government hear their voices			1
just thinking of blocking them is a losing war , and a way to put more pressure on the citizens , " the prince wrote on his @entity17 account monday			1
a number of @entity17 users commented on this post			1
" they wo n't succeed in blocking our voices , @entity17 is our world through which we 'll send our voices , " one wrote			1
" @entity39 of you to talk to the authority rather than talking to the decision makers , " another commented			0
" the era of blocking is over , everything is exposed now , and people will find a way to communicate , even if they had to use pigeons like the old days ! " @entity49 announced in late 2011 that he and his investment firm , @entity50 , had bought a $ 300 million stake in @entity17			0

@entity57 , a @entity58 - based free speech advocacy group , highlighted the limits imposed on free expression by @entity2 in its report last year on @entity63 freedoms around the world , " @entity65			0
" the kingdom was one of a number of countries in which " authorities imposed further restrictions following the political uprisings in @entity73 and @entity74 , in which social media played a key role , " it said			2
@entity2 authorities have detained and intimidated hundreds of online political activists and online commentators , blocked and filtered sensitive political , religious or pornographic content from entering the @entity2 internet , and even recruited supporters online to campaign against calls for protests , the report said			2
divided kingdom @entity87 , project director of @entity88 on the @entity89 , told @entity0 there had been an increasing number of arrests of @entity2 internet users who 've posted critical remarks online , including on @entity17 , since the report came out last september			2
according to tracking by @entity57 , 51 % of @entity2 internet users are active on @entity17 , which is one of the highest ratios in the world			2
" the @entity2 authorities have been struggling for the past several years with decisions on how to deal with the growing and increasingly critical discussions online , " @entity87 said			2
" in recent months there have been increasing proposals by the authorities to either limit access to social media or to increase surveillance and decrease privacy for users			1
" one proposal under discussion has been the introduction of a rule requiring each @entity2 @entity17 user to register using government @entity115 , she said			0
it has not been implemented but has attracted a lot of attention because of the popularity of @entity17 in the kingdom			0
" if this really comes into reality , it would be in effect a way for the government to track who 's posting what , " she said			0
those at the liberal end of the spectrum in @entity2 are outraged by the idea of such registration , she said			0
" they feel that at the moment one of the few ways for them to vent and to engage in political conversations is through social media , " she said			0
but at the other end of the spectrum , " there are a lot of conservative voices in @entity2 who are saying that social media -- twitter in particular -- is a huge waste of time , " and so would support this kind of measure , @entity87 said			1
this division reflects a broader cleavage in @entity2 society between progressives who are trying to push the boundaries of what is allowed and more conservative elements who are trying to maintain the status quo and see social media as a threat , she added			1
up to now , @entity2 authorities have been able to identify more prominent social media users , but a change in the rules might mean those who post online under the cover of anonymity are also exposed , she said			1
a likely consequence would be increased self - censorship			0
@entity49 , who is one of many @entity2 princes , is more prominent in business circles , @entity87 added , so his more progressive views do not necessarily represent what is being discussed among the ruling elite .			0
