nothing riles up the @entity2 chattering class like a broken pledge against raising taxes			0
just ask sen. @entity5 , a veteran @entity7 @entity6 who this week turned his back on the @entity10 he signed years ago as a rite of passage in right - wing politics			1
immediately labeled " worthless " and " a liar " on the website @entity15 , @entity5 symbolizes the political conundrum facing @entity6 leaders after president @entity19 's re-election			1
after years of opposing higher taxes on anyone , @entity6 now are under pressure to work out a comprehensive agreement to reduce the nation 's chronic federal deficits and debt			2
that means a compromise with @entity19 and @entity29 , who insist on more tax revenue being part of a package that includes spending cuts and entitlement reforms			1
@entity35 returns to @entity36 next week after the @entity38 break with just over a month to work out the blueprint for a deal that would avoid the so - called fiscal cliff , a combination of steep across - the - board spending cuts and tax increases set to occur at the end of the year			1
@entity46 : obamacare on table for ' fiscal cliff ' talks facing imminent unpopular scenarios such as higher taxes for everyone and further cuts in military spending , the negotiations taking place behind closed doors in @entity36 have new impetus to produce results			1
@entity19 's victory this month with a slightly stronger @entity29 majority in the @entity63 and a slightly weaker @entity6 majority in the @entity65 signaled general public acceptance of the president 's main campaign theme : raising more tax revenue from the rich as part of a deficit - reduction package			2
in particular , @entity19 and @entity29 insist that wealthy @entity72 , so far identified as those with income higher than $ 200,000 for individuals or $ 250,000 for families , should pay more taxes than they do now so that rates for everyone else stay the same			0
@entity79 responds to senator 's break with no - tax pledge however , the new @entity35 to be seated in january includes 39 senators , including @entity5 , and 219 @entity65 members who have signed the anti-tax pledge pushed by @entity79 of @entity86 , according to the group 's website			1
the @entity65 total constitutes a narrow majority in the 435 - seat chamber , though some members have denounced their allegiance to the pledge much like @entity5 did wednesday in an interview with @entity97 affiliate @entity96 , a @entity7 television station			1
" i care more about my country than i do about a 20 - year - old pledge , " said @entity5 , who faces re-election for a third @entity63 term in 2014			1
referring to @entity79 , who has vowed to oppose candidates who break the pledge , @entity5 said that " if we do it his way , then we 'll continue in debt , and i just have a disagreement with him about that			1
" in response to @entity5 , @entity79 told @entity97 that the senator " wrote a commitment to the voters of @entity7			1
" " he got elected and re-elected making that commitment , " said @entity79			2
" he 's never promised me anything			2
" @entity79 said he believes @entity5 was " caught " on a tv station and that " he said some things perhaps that did n't make sense			1
" if the senator wants to " change his mind and become a tax increaser , " @entity79 said , " he needs to have that conversation with the people of @entity7			2
" fiscal cliff helps mend @entity19 - ceo relations @entity5 acknowledged that @entity79 and @entity86 will likely work against his re-election because of the issue			1
" but i do n't worry about that because i care too much about my country , " @entity5 said , adding that he was " willing to do the right thing and let the political consequences take care of themselves			2
" possible consequences were evident on friday			0
" to call @entity5 an idiot is to insult people of lower intelligence , " blogger @entity15 of @entity15 wrote			2
" @entity5 is a poster child for every thing that is wrong with the political class in @entity36			2
" later in his post , @entity15 sharpened his point : " if you give your word and you break your word , then you are a liar			0
" @entity15 also called chambliss the worst rino -- @entity154 -- in @entity36 , citing an acronym that conservatives use for those they consider to be sell - out politicians			0
" if you are a worthless @entity6 politician and you want some good press from the liberal media , " @entity15 wrote , " all you have to do now days is say you are considering abandoning your pledge not to raise taxes			0
" however , other conservative voices , including veteran sen. @entity161 of @entity162 , have questioned whether the @entity79 pledge remains politically relevant in the face of the mounting federal debt and @entity19 's re-election			1
@entity167 , the editor of the @entity168 , said after the november 6 vote that @entity6 should consider going along with the president 's call for making the wealthy pay higher taxes , telling " @entity174 " that " it would n't kill the country			0
" on the same program , @entity6 sen. @entity176 of @entity177 said " the yin and the yang of this is that we know there has to be revenues			0
" " i have n't met a wealthy @entity6 or @entity193 in @entity177 that 's not willing to contribute more as long as they know we solve the problem , " @entity176 noted , adding that reforming entitlement programs such as @entity186 , the government - run health care system for senior citizens , was another key part of the package			0
@entity79 and other conservatives argue that shrinking the government is the only way to properly address the deficit issue			0
their mantra is that @entity72 spends too much on government , not that it collects too little in taxes			0
the @entity205 says the signer will " oppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and / or businesses " and will " oppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits , unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates			0
" deficit reduction ? not without entitlement reform that commitment puts any adherents in conflict with the direction of the deficit negotiations under way between the @entity65 and @entity35			0
at the @entity227 on monday , @entity79 predicted that @entity6 would prevent any deficit deal from containing a tax increase			1
long a defining difference between @entity29 and @entity6 , the tax issue has stymied efforts to work out a deficit deal for the past two years			2
@entity19 and @entity65 speaker @entity46 came close to agreement last year before conservative rejection of any increased revenue and liberal resistance to entitlement reform scuttled the effort			0
@entity46 , the @entity240 @entity6 who has emerged as party leader in the deficit talks , agrees to the concept of increased revenue , though he and @entity63 minority leader @entity247 of @entity248 both remain opposed to actually raising tax rates			0
instead , they propose broad tax reform that will lower rates while eliminating unspecified loopholes and exemptions to spur economic growth that they say will result in more overall government revenue			0
@entity5 , whose voting record got a perfect rating in 2010 from the @entity260 , has played a supporting role in the deficit debate			0
he joined colleagues from both parties in the so - called @entity266 senators trying to work out a comprehensive deal on the sidelines of the main talks between the @entity65 and @entity35			1
last year , @entity79 's group called at one point for @entity5 and the other two @entity6 to drop out of the @entity266 talks that were considering increased tax revenue as part of the deal			1
@entity79 later sent a letter to @entity5 and @entity6 colleagues @entity161 and sen. @entity278 of @entity279 to clarify that their stance met the conditions of the pledge because they wanted any increase in revenue to come from economic growth spurred by lower tax rates			1
" this is very encouraging news from you , " @entity79 wrote then			0
" it means that you will fulfill the @entity10 you made to your constituents and the @entity72 people to oppose and vote against legislated net income tax increases			0
" opinion : @entity6 must avoid the fiscal cliff			1

" he 's never promised me anything , " @entity79 says about sen. @entity5
@entity5 is the latest conservative to reject @entity79 's pledge
@entity35 returns to work next week facing the year - end " fiscal cliff "
without a deal , tax hikes and steep spending cuts will take effect next year
