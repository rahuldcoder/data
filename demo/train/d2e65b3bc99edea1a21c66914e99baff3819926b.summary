the @entity0 voted thursday to hold attorney general @entity1 in contempt for refusing to turn over documents tied to the botched @entity5 gun - running sting -- a discredited operation that has become a sharp point of contention between @entity9 and @entity10 in @entity11			1
the @entity0 approved a pair of criminal and civil measures against the attorney general , marking the first time in @entity16 history that the head of the @entity18 has been held in contempt by @entity20			1
@entity0 members approved the criminal contempt measure in a 255 - 67 vote			1
almost every @entity0 @entity10 backed the measure , along with 17 @entity9			1
shortly thereafter , the civil measure passed in a sharply polarized 258 - 95 vote			1
a large number of @entity9 -- including members of the @entity29 and @entity0 minority leader @entity30 -- walked off the @entity0 floor in protest and refused to participate in the criminal contempt vote			1
a slightly smaller number of @entity9 appeared to boycott the vote on the civil measure as well			1
speaking in @entity37 , @entity1 dismissed the @entity0 action as " the regrettable culmination of what became a misguided -- and politically motivated -- investigation during an election year			1
" in a written statement , @entity44 communications director @entity43 blasted congressional republicans for pushing " political theater rather than legitimate congressional oversight			2
" the criminal contempt charge refers the dispute to @entity11 @entity16 attorney @entity51 , who will decide whether to file charges against @entity1			1
most legal analysts do not expect @entity51 -- an @entity54 appointee who ultimately answers to @entity1 -- to take any action			1
the civil measure allows the @entity57 to file a lawsuit asking the courts to examine the @entity18 's failure to produce certain subpoenaed documents , as well as the validity of the administration 's recent assertion of executive privilege over the documents in question			1
executive privilege : a rocky legal and political road in @entity16 history legal experts contacted by @entity72 have said , based on recent precedent , that it could take years for the courts to reach any final decision in the civil case			2
@entity5 , a so - called " gun - walking " operation , allowed roughly 2,000 guns into @entity80 with the goal of tracking them to @entity80 drug cartels			0
two guns found at the scene of @entity87 agent @entity87 's fatal shooting were linked to the operation			0
guns from the operation have also been linked to an unknown number of @entity80 civilians ' deaths			0
@entity10 leaders say the documents they seek are needed to get to the circumstances surrounding @entity87 's death			0
@entity9 insist the @entity10 - led probe is all about politics			0
thursday 's vote came two days after @entity100 rejected the latest offer by the @entity44 and @entity18 to turn over some of the documents sought by congressional investigators in exchange for dropping the contempt measures			1
a senior @entity0 @entity10 aide told @entity72 the offer was insufficient			1
in the hours leading up to the criminal contempt vote , @entity10 repeatedly insisted that they were exercising proper legislative oversight of the executive branch and seeking answers for @entity87 's family			1
" in the real world @entity16 are expected to comply with subpoenas			0
is the attorney general any different ? no he is not , " said rep. @entity115 , @entity116			1
" the attorney general can stonewall all he wants			1
the attorney general can misremember all he wants			1
but whether he likes it or not , today responsibility will land on his desk			0
" rep. @entity120 , @entity121 , warned that " even the attorney general can not evade the law			1
( it 's ) time for @entity16 to find out the truth			0
... ( it 's ) time for a little transparency			0
that 's just the way it is			0
" house speaker @entity132 , @entity133 , said the " @entity0 needs to know how this happened , and it 's our constitutional duty to find out			1
... no @entity18 is above the law , and no @entity18 is above the @entity138			0
" @entity9 accused @entity10 of playing political games with an operation that leaders on both sides of the aisle concede was a mistake			0
" what the @entity100 are doing with this motion ... is contemptible , " @entity30 declared			0
" this is something that makes a witch hunt look like a day at the beach			0
it is ( the ) railroading of a resolution that is unsubstantiated by the facts , based on a false premise			0
" rep. @entity156 , @entity157 , complained that " every single attempt for even - handed investigation has been thwarted by the @entity10 majority			0
" @entity1 is " a good , decent , honorable man			2
he 's doing an excellent job as attorney general			1
he does not deserve this			0
" among other things , @entity9 contend that @entity166 @entity10 rep. @entity165 , chairman of the @entity57 , has refused to let witnesses proposed by @entity9 give public testimony			0
they also claim he has been demanding documents outside the scope of the subpoenas @entity1 is accused of violating			2
specifically , @entity165 and other @entity10 are seeking documents showing why the @entity18 decided to withdraw as inaccurate a february 2011 letter sent to @entity20 that denied any major flaws in @entity5			0
@entity1 has repeatedly refused to turn over materials containing internal deliberations , and asked @entity54 last week to assert executive privilege over such documents			2
opinion : holder contempt vote sign of ' broken ' @entity11 ? a video released tuesday by @entity9 on @entity165 's panel showed the chairman making past allegations of @entity44 links to @entity5 , juxtaposed with @entity165 saying sunday there was no evidence of a @entity44 cover - up			2
some gun rights advocates , including the @entity190 , maintain that the program allowed hundreds of weapons , including assault rifles , to end up in the hands of @entity80 drug cartels in order for the @entity54 administration to press for new gun control laws			0
the @entity190 heavily pressured @entity0 members -- most notably moderate and conservative @entity9 -- to back the contempt measures			1
the contempt vote in @entity165 's committee last week fell along strict party lines , with republicans supporting a contempt recommendation and @entity9 opposing it			2
the vote occurred before the gun lobby formally registered its support for the contempt resolution			2
rarely has any pro-gun - rights @entity210 representing a rural and @entity213 district broken with the @entity190 's position on key votes , especially in an election year			0
meanwhile , @entity30 argued last week that @entity10 were targeting @entity1 because he is fighting their efforts to suppress voter turnout in november			2
rep. @entity219 , @entity220 , chastised @entity10 earlier this week for pushing ahead on the contempt vote as part of a strategy to prevent economic progress and harm @entity54 's re-election chances in november			2
" this is just all part of a continuing plan , and whether it 's suppressing the vote or suppressing the economy -- this obstructionist regime that we see that continues to block because they think they would rather see president @entity54 fail than the nation succeed , " @entity219 said			2
read the @entity237 read the full contempt report the truth about the @entity5 scandal			0

@entity0 passes a measure also authorizing civil action against @entity1
@entity0 passes criminal contempt measure against attorney general @entity1
@entity1 dismisses vote as " politically motivated "
at issue is whether @entity1 complied with a subpoena from congressional investigators
