-- @entity1 was rejected by @entity2 as a youth player , and @entity4 claims he does n't even remember the player 's time at @entity7			1
but the 24 - year - old made a point to the veteran manager on saturday , scoring the only goal as his @entity13 team knocked @entity2 off the top of the @entity15			1
@entity13 's 1 - 0 home win left @entity2 a point behind rivals @entity18 , who earlier thrashed @entity20 5 - 0			1
" we 've been a bit more ruthless and we 're putting our chances away ; maybe we could have had another one at the end to make it a bit more comfortable , " said @entity1 , whose 60th - minute header inflicted @entity2 's third league defeat in 12 matches and lifted @entity13 up to 13th			1
" it 's a great day for @entity13 and it 's a massive win for us			1
we 've been performing well over the last couple of weeks and we showed today that we could beat the team that is probably the best in the league			0
" @entity2 went into the match without @entity37 striker @entity36 , who was ill , and could not continue a remarkable run of come - from - behind victories			2
" they deserved the win just because they worked so hard for it , " @entity4 said			0
" the players are used to making comebacks and we 're always a threat in the last minutes of matches			0
we had a lot of half - chances but it just was n't our night			0
" @entity18 face an early @entity49 exit if wednesday 's home clash with @entity51 ends in anything but victory , but the @entity15 champions picked up a morale - boosting win as @entity59 forwards @entity57 and @entity60 scored twice each against a @entity20 side who dropped into the relegation zone			1
@entity65 opened the scoring before halftime , while @entity60 and @entity57 both netted from the penalty spot once as @entity18 remained the only unbeaten team in the division			2
" for us it is very important we start to play well and in the last two games we have scored six goals with our strikers , " said manager @entity71			0
" i think we have been missing their goals			0
" third - placed @entity79 's title hopes continued to fade with a 2 - 1 defeat at this season 's surprise team , @entity81			1
@entity84 's side have now failed to win in four league games , and this setback came in the @entity88 's first return to the club that sacked him in 2009			0
@entity79 's defeat at the same ground in march ended the reign of manager @entity94 , and his assistant @entity95 stepped up to take charge and preside over a historic first @entity98 title			2
the @entity101 club 's chances of progressing to the last 16 of this season 's @entity49 competition could hinge on getting a result from tuesday 's trip to @entity106 in the penultimate match of the group stage			2
@entity81 moved up to fourth to continue the fine start made by new manager @entity110 , who spent four years at @entity79 as assistant manager to first @entity112 and then @entity113			1
@entity79 , missing injured captain @entity114 , went behind to @entity116 's 10th - minute header but midfielder @entity117 leveled six minutes before halftime			2
however , @entity120 forward @entity119 nodded the home team ahead just five minutes after the break from a cross by @entity124 striker @entity116 as @entity81 held on for a sixth win from seven at the @entity126			1
@entity127 dropped to fifth after a 2 - 1 defeat at @entity129 that lifted the promoted team out of the bottom three on goal difference			1
striker @entity132 scored both goals in @entity129 's first top - flight win since may 2008 , after @entity127 led through @entity135 forward @entity136			2
@entity127 went into the match without influential veteran @entity138 , who has been ruled out for up to two months following knee surgery			0
@entity140 closed on the top four with a dramatic 5 - 2 north @entity142 win against @entity143 , who had @entity145 sent off after giving the visitors the lead against his former club			1
the @entity150 striker netted his first goal for @entity143 this season from close range but then saw red after a two - footed lunge on @entity155			2
@entity140 took full advantage as defender @entity159 headed in , fellow @entity157 @entity156 scrambled a second and @entity161 forward @entity160 also scored before halftime			2
@entity163 midfielder @entity155 made it 4 - 1 before @entity164 reduced the deficit but @entity37 international @entity166 boosted his hopes of a new contract as he ensured a repeat of last season 's scoreline			1
spurs dropped to eighth , two points behind their rivals and one behind seventh - placed @entity175 -- who host @entity177 on monday			0
@entity178 claimed 10th place with a 2 - 1 win over @entity181 , who went into the match threatening legal action against @entity186 's national federation after @entity187 was refused permission to play			1
the striker did not travel to @entity190 for a midweek friendly due to a back injury , so @entity186 invoked @entity193 's five - day rule that stops players from missing internationals and returning immediately to play for their clubs			0
" i love playing for my country and would only withdraw from a squad -- for either a friendly or competitive game -- for a genuine reason , " @entity187 said			0
" i am fully supportive of the position my club has adopted in this matter and am sorry that the @entity205 seem to doubt my honesty and integrity			0
i will now consider if i wish to continue to captain my country			0
" @entity210 striker @entity209 and @entity212 @entity211 put @entity178 ahead before a late consolation from @entity187 's compatriot @entity214 -- the forward 's eighth league goal this season			0
@entity218 moved up to 11th with a 3 - 0 win over @entity220 as @entity221 continued his goalscoring run -- and again ran into controversy			1
the @entity225 striker netted a double to move to the top of the @entity15 charts with 10 , but was accused by @entity220 manager @entity229 of stamping on @entity230			1
" the first finish is probably the real clinical one and a sign of a top player , " @entity229 said			0
" he was very fortunate because it was a stamp which the referee did n't see , and that was n't the sign of a top player			0
" @entity239 lost 3 - 1 at home to second - bottom @entity241 , leaving @entity243 ' team four points adrift at the foot of the table as the @entity248 battles to save his job .			1

@entity18 move to top of @entity15 with 5 - 0 win over @entity20
rivals @entity2 drop to second after losing 1 - 0 to @entity13
third - placed @entity79 suffer 2 - 1 defeat away to surprise team @entity81
@entity140 win 5 - 2 in @entity101 derby with @entity143 , who have a player sent off
