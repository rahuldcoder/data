-- @entity2 's loss of market share in the @entity4 is the stuff of legends			1
last fall , it was estimated only about 2 % of @entity4 phone users were still carrying their @entity2 mobile with its iconic keypad			1
but consider this : @entity12 is expected to add 175 million new mobile users in just the coming 3 years			1
that 's according to the @entity15 , which represents the world 's mobile operators			1
" @entity20 has already revolutionized @entity22 society and yet demand still continues to grow by almost 50 percent a year , " said @entity18 , chief government and regulatory affairs officer , @entity15			2
that could be good news indeed for @entity2			2
@entity26 , the maker of @entity2 , estimates it holds a 70 % market share in countries like @entity29			1
the company 's new phones , announced this week , are not the ones some of its best customers in emerging markets would like to buy			1
but @entity26 -- which also this week changed its company name to @entity2 -- is pledging some of its six new models will address that			1
while millions in @entity41 , @entity42 and the @entity4 have adopted @entity44 or @entity45 smartphones with a vengeance , millions more users in emerging markets are enthused about what 's in store for the new @entity2			1
it 's the update for what many of them are already using			1
they live in countries like @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 and @entity29			1
they have embraced the @entity2 for a combination of factors that all point to the different way mobile devices are used			0
unlike their counterparts in @entity42 and @entity4 , the mobile in their pocket is more likely to be their primary link to the internet			1
@entity70 is the connection that allows these users unlimited conversations without paying charges for sms data			0
while young , brand - conscious @entity41 may be willing to part with several months ' salary to buy the latest @entity77 , @entity22 users are looking for more practical ( and cheaper ) connections			0
what separates developed countries from their developing counterparts at street level can be summed up in a single word : infrastructure			2
@entity85 , senior fellow and director of the @entity88 at the @entity89 , says mobile technology has proved it can bridge the gap where infrastructure is lacking			0
" it 's a culture , it 's an economy , it 's innovation , education , healthcare , it 's all of these things , " says @entity93			0
you can take that to the bank			0
for many @entity22 , their cell phone account is the first bank account they 've ever owned			2
in emerging markets , mobile phone banking is growing because of the lack of infrastructure			1
fewer bank branches often mean long distances to travel and long lines once you 've arrived			0
africans are expected to transfer more than $ 200 billion per year or 18 % of the continent 's gdp by 2015			2
oh , and that keyboard			0
no matter where you are in the world , there will always be a demand for a keyboard that clicks			2
the company appears to understand that as @entity2 models come with both soft keypads and the traditional @entity2 buttons			2
i asked some of my @entity127 followers to weigh in on the @entity2 roll out			0
while some said @entity44 or @entity130 's @entity45 were in their future plans , many others expressed continued enthusiasm for the @entity2			0
@entity133 , a pianist and teacher in @entity56 tweeted back " i 'm falling in love with this bb			0
" from @entity138 , @entity137 wrote " i need a physical keyboard to type while also having a touch - screen for photos etc. security factor also important			0
" @entity143 from @entity29 reinforced the sentiments of many mobile users in emerging markets : " the cost of data is simply too high without it ( @entity2			1
) " the voices from emerging markets could n't have been clearer			1
what they expect from @entity2 is a stronger , longer lasting battery , durability and continued low cost connectivity			0
@entity89 's @entity93 agrees that @entity2 ( and anyone else ) trying to win and hold this mobile device sector has to understand how these devices are being used and give the customers what they want			2
not too many bells and whistles			0
" there is little doubt smartphones are changing the way people use the internet , how they bank , shop and interact socially			0
but it 's worth keeping in perspective that in a world where there are now an estimated 1 billion smartphones , there are 5 billion feature phone users			1
that 's a lot of upside growth potential for @entity2 and all the other players out there .			0
