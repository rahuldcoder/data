the @entity0 delivered a @entity1 present to @entity2			1
this is one of the few cohorts of illegal immigrants who are actually innocent of wrongdoing since they were brought here as children by their parents			1
although many @entity2 are reluctant to acknowledge this fact , it 's the parents who did something wrong when they violated immigration law			1
but , in this country , we do n't punish children for the sins of their parents			0
instead , where it makes sense , we make accommodations			0
one such accommodation is @entity25 ( @entity25 ) , a program by the @entity28 administration that allows undocumented youths to apply for a temporary reprieve from deportation and a two - year work permit			2
but what good is a job if you ca n't get to it ? and so now , thanks to the high court and lower federal courts , the estimated 22,000 @entity2 in @entity37 can finally do what thousands of other young adults do each year in the @entity37 : apply for a driver 's license			1
many of these people are driving anyway , and they have been for years			0
why not give them a license and make them buy insurance ? besides , under @entity25 , these kids are working and paying taxes to the state of @entity37 -- some of which go to build roads			1
how can state officials deny these people the right to drive on roads they helped build ? this historic development came about despite the best efforts by state officials to block it , as a way of protesting the administration 's policy			1
whereas officials in most states made no attempt to deny @entity2 driver 's licenses , @entity37 once again outdid itself			1
along with @entity72 , it was one of only two states to deny driving privileges to @entity25 recipients			0
in 2012 , @entity37 gov. @entity77 -- who had already used the immigration issue and her support for a tough state law that required local police to enforce federal immigration statutes to scare up enough votes to win re-election in 2010 -- went so far as to sign an executive order that barred @entity86 from obtaining driver 's licenses			1
normally , the issue of jurisdiction would be a slam dunk			0
regulating driving privileges is the job of states			0
but , when state officials arbitrarily deny one group of people a benefit enjoyed by others -- especially for crass political reasons -- the federal courts must step in and correct the injustice			2
recently , the @entity102 began the process of making such a correction when it ruled that @entity106 's prohibition of driver 's licenses for @entity2 was likely unconstitutional and told a lower court to issue a temporary injunction preventing state officials from enforcing the executive order			1
in a 6 - 3 decision , the @entity0 declined to review the lower court ruling and denied @entity106 's request for a stay			1
@entity118 district court judge @entity117 will hold a hearing on january 7 to hear oral arguments and decide whether to make the injunction permanent			2
within days of the high court 's ruling , @entity2 ( for the @entity121 ) started lining up at @entity125 offices around the state to apply for driver 's licenses			1
in @entity37 , and around the country , we can spend the next few years haggling over the details of what the actual driver 's licenses look like			1
some states might choose to add distinguishing marks to driver 's licenses that go to the undocumented			1
some states have already done that , for instance , stamping the words : " for driving purposes only " or " @entity144 " on top of some licenses			0
this prevents these documents from being used for other purposes , such as boarding airplanes			0
if they were meant for driving , then it 's fine to limit their uses to driving			2
there is nothing wrong with these distinguishing marks , and if allowing them breaks the political impasse in some states and lets people drive legally who might not otherwise have that privilege , then all the better			0
but this story is about much more than being able to drive			0
it 's about @entity86 stepping up and declaring their loyalty to the @entity118 and their intent to stay here			1
where else do they have to go ? they came here as children -- in fact , some as infants -- and they 've lived here most of their lives			0
this is their country , just as much as it is yours or mine			0
they 're not here to subvert our way of life , but to join it			1
they want to be part of the family			0
and , given the initiative and perseverance they 've shown in just getting this far , we should welcome that			0
think about what happened recently when about 40 @entity86 -- from @entity37 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 and @entity196 -- decided to do what nativists tell them to do and " go back to @entity196			2
" the nativists want @entity86 to go one - way , but this group went round - trip			2
i 've interviewed some of these travelers , including @entity205 and @entity206 , the outspoken co-directors of the @entity208			0
during the trip , which was organized by the @entity211 and @entity196 's @entity212 and made possible because of the limited travel privileges that come with @entity25 , something happened that was interesting but not totally unexpected			2
after spending years in the @entity118 being viewed as @entity216 , once the @entity2 got to @entity196 , they were treated as @entity118			1
and , the more the @entity2 interacted with native @entity216 , the more it became clear that this is how they see themselves as well			2
living in the @entity118 has shaped their world view in profound ways that ca n't be undone			2
it 's been said that these undocumented youths are caught between two worlds			0
but now we know that they only belong in one country			0

@entity230 : @entity0 gave an early @entity1 gift to @entity2
the estimated 22,000 @entity2 in the state can finally apply for a driver 's license
he says @entity86 are innocent of any wrongdoing and are loyal to the @entity118
@entity230 : they 're not here to subvert our way of life , but to join it and contribute to society
