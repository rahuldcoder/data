@entity0 -- former @entity3 press secretary @entity2 -- a longtime journalist before he joined the @entity5 administration in its infancy -- is back in the media game as a political analyst for @entity1			1
we caught up with @entity2 on wednesday , in the hours before president @entity5 addresses the nation to outline his plan for dismantling @entity12 , the brutal terrorist group that 's roiling @entity13 and @entity14			1
a former @entity3 insider , @entity2 had insight into how the president and his team are preparing for such a major address			1
but he also riffed on the state of the news media , the " not ideal " state of the @entity3 press briefing , @entity25 's potential campaign and how @entity26 has accelerated the political news cycle			1
@entity1 : so pull back the curtain a little bit , if you can , before tonight 's speech			1
what is happening today ? who is in the room with the president , and what is he doing in there ? @entity2 : when speeches are important like this one , the president is the primary writer of the speech			1
he will get a draft , a very good one , from his team			0
but he will spend a good amount of time making sure it 's really what he wants to say			1
i am sure as we get closer to speech time he will be fine - tuning it , working with his team			1
and he is keenly aware of the unique opportunity to give a speech to the nation			1
they do n't come that often			0
there are n't that many occasions , outside of a @entity61 address , where a president in this media age has an audience as big as he 'll have tonight			1
analysis : @entity5 speech a do - over on ' no strategy ' @entity1 : from a communications strategy perspective , when do you guys make the calculation that an issue deserves a national address in primetime ? @entity2 : the truth is we would do it more , but the networks , especially the broadcast networks , are not always willing to say yes			1
the threshold question is , you know , is it of national significance on a major issue -- something that the president feels the @entity89 people need to hear about ? matters of military force are the most obvious circumstances that merit a primetime address			1
there are also issues around significant domestic legislation , or national issues			0
he did a national speech launching health care reform that was primetime			2
it 's not a well you can go back to that often , though , because it requires the networks to give the time			2
i remember when i was there , we asked for time once and the networks shot us down , which was very frustrating			0
( the @entity3 requested primetime real estate in april to tout health care enrollment numbers			1
) we did a little research , and there was a pretty good case to be made that the reluctance to give time has increased over the years			0
the ask we made might have been granted in past presidencies			0
but that 's just the nature of the business			2
i do n't think it 's going to change			2
@entity5 is open to airstrikes on @entity12 in @entity14 , wants to arm rebels @entity1 : how frustrated is the president that @entity126 conflict is consuming his agenda right now , after taking a victory lap by ending the wars in @entity13 and @entity130 , and after the big 2009 @entity132 speech that was aimed at repairing @entity89 's image in the world ? @entity2 : i do n't think he gets surprised or disappointed by the revelation that the world does n't bend to your will and your agenda all that willingly			1
it 's been the fundamental responsibility of being president , and a huge part of the job , to deal with these kind of crises overseas and potential threats to the @entity89			1
i do n't think he is disappointed			0
i think he is realistic about the fact that there is still a lot of work he wants to get done			0
and he knows that the time he has left will go by pretty quickly			0
my guess is that he realizes that the absolute necessity of dealing with the @entity155 , and with the situation in @entity157 , reduces the amount of time and focus he can put on other topics			0
but it 's not really a choice for him			2
you do n't have the choice you just have to do it			0
as @entity5 prepares for @entity12 fight , where are the doves ? @entity1 : the president caught a ton of flak for golfing after making a statement on the beheading of @entity173			1
he said on ' @entity174 ' this weekend that the optics of politics do n't come natural to him			0
the guy is obviously a talented showman and politician			0
does he really not get the theatrics of politics at this point ? @entity2 : here is what i say about that			1
he definitely does n't and never has approached the job in a way that puts a high priority or focus on optics , and i think that 's because 10 years and a few months ago if you passed him on the street , you would n't have known who he was			2
that makes him wholly different			0
what that means is , he is a different kind of person than the kind of person who normally takes this office			0
sometimes that creates problems , but i also thinks it 's why he is president , and why he was re-elected			1
you ca n't be both somebody who emerged from outside @entity0 and catapulted onto the scene with a powerful message and also be a known entity to national political reporters and the general @entity89 public as somebody who was aspiring to the presidency for years			2
you ca n't be both			0
he is not a typical and never was a typical politician			0
that 's an asset and a liability			2
you ca n't say , ' i wish he was more like this or that , ' because if he were , he would n't be the guy who persuaded more than 50 % of the country to vote for him two times in a row			0
that 's a long way of saying he is never going to be the kind of president who is routinely focused on the optics and theatrics of the office			1
sometimes that 's going to cause him problems and frustrate his aides			2
when that happens , you also have to remember it 's part of who he is			2
@entity5 : golfing after @entity173 statement was a bad idea @entity1 : does he ever consult with former president @entity251 before big moments like this ? do they have that kind of relationship these days ? @entity2 : i do n't know how often they talk			1
i do n't think it would necessarily be before a speech like this , but i could be wrong			2
he is certainly close to former secretary ( @entity25 ) @entity251 and to president @entity251			2
he saw him not that long ago , in august			0
but there is n't a regular conversation that i was aware of			0
but it 's not an infrequent one either			2
@entity251 and @entity266 yuk it up @entity1 : we 're starting to see blind quotes from @entity25 " aides " expressing criticism of @entity5 's handling of @entity14 and @entity13			1
if she runs for president , how does @entity25 balance the thornier parts of @entity5 's record with her time in the administration ? @entity2 : obviously that 's something that she will figure out if she decides to run			1
she was secretary of state for president @entity5 for four years and she understands that record will be part of what she runs on			1
her time as secretary of state is something she should be proud of , and the president 's record on foreign policy is something she is more likely to embrace than anything because she was a big part of it			1
' hugging it out ' : @entity25 calls @entity5 to calm tensions @entity1 : so what exactly is the point of @entity3 briefings ? @entity2 : it 's become kind of theatrical and probably less helpful than either the @entity3 or @entity3 press corps wishes it would be			1
it 's kind of ironic because now i am a contributor on a tv channel , but the reason that is , by and large , is because of tv			2
@entity304 , my predecessor , one of @entity251 's press secretaries , has apologized to every one of his successors for being the press secretary who agreed to televise the entirety of press briefings			2
prior to that they were only televised for the first 10 minutes and then the cameras were turned off			0
but if you look at transcripts of a regular daily briefing in which the cameras are on , and compare it substantively and tonally to an off - camera briefing on @entity323 â € ” the gaggles that i would do and press secretaries would do with traveling press on the plane			2
the @entity3 ones â € ” it 's a lot of different			1
the ones not on camera tend to be more sober , more based in information and less gotcha - oriented			2
the format is not ideal anymore			0
the problem is if @entity337 ( @entity338 ) or any successor of his were to suddenly announce we were n't doing it anymore there would be an uproar by the press , and by the tv press			0
if they were to say no more on - camera briefings , that would not be accepted			0
@entity3 press secretary @entity2 leaving @entity1 : does @entity26 make your job easier or more difficult ? @entity2 : oh man			1
not in a bad way			0
it put what was already an extremely fast news cycle into warp - speed			1
obviously this @entity3 is the only one that has existed in the era of @entity26			1
these tools can be very useful for getting information out			0
the @entity3 has become much more @entity26 - focused with more people having @entity26 handles on staff			1
the fact that @entity26 has become such a driving force in breaking news creates a whole host of challenges			0
it 's sort of like the challenges that @entity1 first created for @entity370 back when they were the only 24 - hour television news network			1
it just changed the pace dramatically			0
so @entity26 and social media have done that again			0
@entity1 : last one : what was the dumbest news cycle during your time in the @entity3 ? @entity2 : wow			1
there are so many to choose from			0
the first one that came to mind was the birth certificate saga			0
there is one every week or every month competing with serious stuff			0
look , everybody finds themselves chasing the ball down the field sometimes and they wish they had n't			0
i think it 's both reporters and @entity3			1
but everybody ends up being better served , included readers and viewers of the media , if everybody reverts back to stuff that actually matters .			0
