@entity2 one of seven patients infected by the deadly superbug bacteria @entity6 is blaming a manufacturer of the medical scope used in his endoscopic procedure at a @entity2 hospital , the patient 's attorney said thursday			1
the accusation was made on the same day the @entity13 issued a safety advisory about how the scope 's design may impede effective cleaning			1
the patient , an 18 - year - old high school student whose name was n't released , is planning to sue one of the scope 's manufacturers , said attorney @entity23			1
the student was " very , very close to death , " @entity23 said			0
" he 's not doing well now			0
" that manufacturer , @entity26 , is one of three that the @entity13 has identified as makers of the scope			1
@entity26 said the firm provides instructions , guidance and supplemental educational materials on how to conduct effective cleaning of its endoscopes , also called duodenoscopes			1
" while all endoscopes , including duodenoscopes , require thorough reprocessing after patient use in order to be safe , the @entity41 requires careful attention to cleaning and reprocessing steps , including meticulous manual cleaning , to ensure effective reprocessing , " which is a reuse of the same device , said @entity38 , the company 's executive director of communications and marketing			1
in addition to instructions and guidance given to every customer , @entity26 makes available supplemental educational materials on cleaning the devices			1
" @entity26 is monitoring this issue closely including today 's safety communication from the @entity13 ( @entity13 )			0
we are working with the @entity13 , relevant medical societies and our customers regarding these concerns , " @entity38 said			1
meanwhile , the other two manufacturers identified by the @entity13 , @entity66 and @entity67 , could n't be reached for comment thursday			0
understanding @entity6 , the ' nightmare ' superbug in all , seven patients at the @entity73 have caught @entity6 after routine endoscopic treatments for bile ducts , gall bladder or pancreas , and two of them have died , a hospital spokeswoman said			1
the deadly bacteria @entity6 , or carbapenem - resistant enterobacteriaceae , was a contributing factor in the deaths , but the exact cause of those deaths was n't immediately disclosed , a hospital spokeswoman said			1
the medical center is contacting 179 others who had endoscopic procedures between october and january and is offering them home tests to screen for the deadly bacteria			1
the 18 - year - old patient went to the @entity94 hospital for a suspected leaking pancreas in 2014 , @entity23 said			1
but the outpatient endoscopic procedure did n't reveal a leaking pancreas , and the youth returned home , @entity23 said			2
later , the young man was taken to a hospital again , where he remained for more than 80 days , @entity23 said			0
the patient also spent time in intensive care , @entity23 added			2
the attorney declined to state whether the second hospital visit was at the same @entity94 facility			2
the attorney also said thursday the patient does n't blame the @entity94 hospital for his infection			1
the @entity94 hospital was scheduled to hold a press conference thursday afternoon at 5:30 p.m. et on the superbug incident			2
the patient was released from hospitalization , but within the last two weeks , he returned a third time to a hospital , where he remains , @entity23 said thursday			2
the attorney also declined to identify that hospital			2
@entity23 alleges that in mid- 2014 , @entity26 altered the design of the endoscope and removed a cleaning channel but did n't change the cleaning protocol			2
the scoping procedure is called endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography or @entity125 , the @entity122 said			0
the medical procedure is used to , among other things , unblock bile ducts and take care of pancreas issues			1
" it is estimated that more than 500,000 @entity133 are performed each year in the @entity134 , " the society said			0
" from what we know , over the past few years , there have been fewer than 100 known cases of transmission of these problematic bacteria through @entity125			0
" the @entity125 procedure involves a duodenoscope , a flexible , lighted tube that is threaded through the mouth , throat , stomach and into the top of the small intestine ( the duodenum ) , the @entity13 said			0
the device contains a hollow channel that allows the injection of contrast dye or the insertion of other instruments to obtain tissue samples for biopsy or treat certain abnormalities			0
the device also has a movable " elevator " mechanism at the tip , the agency said			0
even meticulously cleaning the devices before high - level disinfection " may not entirely eliminate " the risk of transmitting infection , the @entity13 said			1
" reprocessing is a detailed , multistep process to clean and disinfect or sterilize reusable devices			0
recent medical publications and adverse event reports associate multidrug - resistant bacterial infections in patients who have undergone @entity125 with reprocessed duodenoscopes , even when manufacturer reprocessing instructions are followed correctly , " the @entity13 said			0
" although the complex design of duodenoscopes improves the efficiency and effectiveness of @entity125 , it causes challenges for cleaning and high - level disinfection			0
some parts of the scopes may be extremely difficult to access and effective cleaning of all areas of the duodenoscope may not be possible , " the @entity13 said			0
@entity3 's @entity188 and @entity189 contributed to this report .			0
