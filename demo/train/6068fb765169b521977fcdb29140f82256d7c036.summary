-- when it comes to advertising on mobile devices , banner ads and pop - ups are the norm			1
but for @entity9 - based company @entity8 , it 's out with the old and in with the new			1
@entity10 co-founded the organization in 2011 with business partners @entity12 and @entity14			0
the company aims to flip mobile advertising on its head by allowing users to interact with apps and adverts , and then rewarding consumers for engaging			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity21 to find out how @entity8 is changing the nature of advertising on mobile			1
@entity0 : how does @entity8 work ? @entity10 : the way it works is that the core software is getting integrated into a whole host of different applications			1
so it can be sports , news , weather , games			0
and with that base of applications that we have that gives us access to millions of users , we 're then able to deliver very , very targeted advertising and affective advertising to those users			2
@entity0 : how do these rewards appear on - screen for users ? @entity46 : what it generally looks like , is you have a program where someone reaches an engagement milestone , like you 've checked in for the day or you shared content with a friend or you 've watched a video and a little message will pop - up and say , congratulations you 've unlocked this achievement			2
and that achievement is something they can choose to claim at that time			0
or they can ignore and claim later			0
once they claim the achievement the loyalty layer comes full screen and they have a chance to then get congratulated by a sponsor and then they can go in and browse our store front the actual rewards they want to choose			2
and you can take your points and apply them for a sweepstakes , you can give to generate clean water , or get a @entity78 gift card			0
@entity0 : you previously worked in @entity80 's mobile advertising unit before transitioning to your own start - up			1
how did you make customers see the innovative potential in @entity8 ? @entity46 : when you 're truly doing something new , there 's the advantage that you may be one of the few players that 's doing something like this			2
but the challenge is that you have to educate the market and share your vision with the market			0
for us , part of it was just being really tenacious and persistent with getting our first customers to sign on and really and really saying or pitching that this was a chance for them to be a first , to be innovative as an organization and to be cutting edge on what 's new and what 's gon na work .			0
