the @entity1 @entity0 is legally prohibited from having any control over curriculum or instruction in the nation 's public schools , but nonetheless secretary of education @entity7 is a zealous advocate of the new common core standards for students ' proficiency in @entity13 and math. first , he said their critics were members of extremist groups , and he recently assailed the parents who criticize them as " white suburban moms who — all of a sudden — their child is n't as brilliant as they thought they were , and their school is n't quite as good as they thought they were			1
" his remarks were prompted by the nearly unanimous outrage expressed by parents -- moms and dads -- at public forums in suburban districts in @entity29 , following the release of the abysmal results of the new @entity33 tests			1
the parents were n't angry because they found out their child was n't brilliant , but because most were told by the state that their children were failures			2
only 31 % of the state 's students in grades third through eighth passed or exceeded the new tests			1
among students who are @entity13 - language learners , only 3 % passed the @entity13 standards ; among students with disabilities , only 5 % passed them ; among black and @entity47 students , fewer than 20 % passed			1
the numbers for math were better , but not by much			0
the high failure rate did not happen because the students are dumb , but because the state chose to set an unrealistic passing mark			2
the state commissioner knew before any student had taken the test that only 30 % or so would pass ; that is where the state commissioner set the passing mark			0
@entity7 likes to boast that the @entity33 standards were adopted by 45 states , but neglects to mention that the states were required to adopt " college - and - career - ready standards " to be eligible for $ 4.35 billion in the education secretary 's signature program called @entity66			1
some states adopted them without seeing a finished draft			0
the standards , unfortunately , were never field - tested			1
no one knew in advance whether they would improve achievement or depress it , whether they would widen or narrow the achievement gap among children of different races			0
it is hard to imagine a major corporation releasing a new product nationwide without first testing it among consumers to see if it is successful			0
but that is what happened with the @entity33 standards			1
experts in early childhood education say the standards for young children are developmentally inappropriate			2
teachers say that they have not had the training or resources to teach the new standards			1
field - testing would have ironed out many of the bugs , but promoters of the standards insisted on fast implementation			1
no one yet has estimated the costs of shifting from state standards to national standards			0
@entity7 awarded $ 350 million to develop new tests for the new standards , but all of the testing will be done online			2
@entity106 intends to spend $ 1 billion on @entity107 for the @entity108 , designed to help prepare for the standards			0
if that is the cost to only one district , how many billions will schools across the nation pay for software and hardware and bandwidth for @entity33 testing ? this will be a bonanza for the technology industry , but will put a strain on public school budgets in a time of austerity			1
the @entity33 standards emphasize critical thinking and reasoning			1
it is time for public officials to demonstrate critical thinking and to stop the rush to implementation and do some serious field - testing			1
it is time to fix the standards that do n't work in real classrooms with real students			2
it is time to stop testing students on material they have not been taught			0
@entity1 students take more tests than students in any other nation			0
our dependence on standardized testing has become excessive			0
standards alone ca n't right everything that needs fixing in @entity1 education , and some experts , like @entity152 at @entity153 , say they will make little or no difference in student achievement			2
public officials should listen to the moms and dads			0
this is a democracy , and it is not the role of public officials to impose their grand ideas without the consent of the governed .			0

@entity166 : education *department* should not push @entity33 standards
@entity166 : just 31 % of @entity171 students passed because standards unrealistic
@entity166 : teachers are not prepared to teach them ; parents do n't like them
field - testing should have been done , she says , not fast implementation
