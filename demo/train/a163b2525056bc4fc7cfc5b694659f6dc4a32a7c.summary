@entity0 -- the case of @entity4 's " wardrobe malfunction " on national television -- and subsequent fines against @entity7 -- will be re-examined at the order of the @entity9			1
@entity10 and @entity4 perform at the @entity11 just before the infamous " wardrobe malfunction			1
" the justices monday sent the case back to a federal appeals court in @entity16 that had thrown out a $ 550,000 government fine against the broadcast network and its affiliates for airing the incident during halftime of the @entity22			1
the pop singer 's breast was briefly exposed during a performance with singer @entity10			2
after viewer complaints and national media attention , the @entity26 said the @entity30 incident was obscene			0
in addition to @entity7 , 20 of its affiliates also were fined			1
@entity32 quickly reacted at the time to the visual shocker by increasing the limit on indecency fines tenfold , up to $ 325,000 per violation per network			0
and it said each local affiliate that aired such incidents also could be punished by the same amount			0
but the 3rd @entity42 @entity41 concluded the communications commission had acted " arbitrarily and capriciously			1
" the @entity9 's action marks the second time in recent days that it has dealt with cases involving broadcast standards			1
last week , the justices narrowly upheld the authority of the @entity26 to punish networks for airing profanity			2
the government clampdown on obscene images and words began in 2003			0
enforcement of the law , as well as fines and sanctions for the incidents , have been put on hold while the cases are being argued			0
the television networks say their scripted shows no longer air nudity , racy images or expletives , even after 10 p.m. , when some potentially vulgar words are permitted			2
they worry , however , about unplanned , often spontaneous indecent or profane incident at live events , such as awards shows and sporting events			2
@entity75 officials say such programs are often on a five - second delay , and censors are on hand to bleep any offensive language			2
but some indecent words can slip through , they admit , and they want to be protected from heavy government fines			0
" this past summer , @entity7 edited into a show that had to go through multiple reviews , by multiple people in the organization , the f - word , " said @entity85 , who heads the @entity86 , and is supporting the @entity26 's efforts			1

the show in question was " @entity99 10 , " a taped series			0
the @entity30 incident was not on a five - second delay			0
@entity7 issued a statement monday afternoon it is confident that the appeals court " will again recognize that the @entity11 incident , while inappropriate and regrettable , was not and could not have been anticipated by @entity7			1
" the issue is an important one " for the entire broadcasting industry , " it said , " because it recognizes that there are rare instances , particularly during live programming , when despite best efforts it may not be possible to block unfortunate fleeting material			0
" in the case involving profane language , the high court concluded 5 - 4 that the communications commission has the authority to sanction broadcast tv networks that air isolated incidents of profanity , known as " fleeting expletives			1
" but the justices in that case refused to decide whether the commission 's policy violates the @entity130 guarantee of free speech			0
it ruled only on their enforcement power			0
the justices ordered the free - speech aspect to be reviewed again by a federal appeals court			1
the " wardrobe malfunction " case is @entity26 v. @entity139 ( 08 - 653 ) .			1
