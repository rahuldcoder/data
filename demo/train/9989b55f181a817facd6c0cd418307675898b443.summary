the @entity0 on wednesday unanimously ruled that police may not search the cell phones of criminal suspects upon arrest without a warrant -- a sweeping endorsement for privacy rights			1
by a 9 - 0 vote , the justices said smart phones and other electronic devices were not in the same category as wallets , briefcases , and vehicles -- all currently subject to limited initial examination by law enforcement			2
generally such searches are permitted if there is " probable cause " that a crime has been committed , to ensure officers ' safety and prevent destruction of evidence			1
criminal suspects in @entity27 and @entity28 were separately convicted , in part , after phone numbers , text messages , photos and addresses obtained from personal electronic devices linked them to drug and gang activity			2
those cases were appealed to the high court , giving it an opportunity to re-enter the public debate over the limits of privacy rights , with a focus on the ubiquitous cellphone and its vast storage of information and video			1
the appeals were not related to the recent mass surveillance of phone metadata by the @entity51 , which has raised similar constitutional concerns			0
" the fact that technology now allows an individual to carry such information in his hand does not make the information any less worthy of the protection for which the @entity61 fought , " the ruling said			0
" our answer to the question of what police must do before searching a cell phone seized incident to an arrest is accordingly simple â€” get a warrant			1
" @entity71 , a @entity72 spokeswoman , said the agency would work with law enforcement to ensure " full compliance " with the decision			1
" we will make use of whatever technology is available to preserve evidence on cell phones while seeking a warrant , and we will assist our agents in determining when exigent circumstances or another applicable exception to the warrant requirement will permit them to search the phone immediately without a warrant , " @entity71 said			1
most people have cellphones a january @entity91 survey found more than 90 percent of @entity92 now own or regularly use a cellphone , and 58 percent have a more sophisticated smartphone			1
they have become the most quickly adopted technology ever			0
it 's estimated that most of the world 's 7 billion people have access to mobile devices , according to the @entity102			1
lower courts nationwide are divided over how to apply a 40 - year - old high court precedent allowing searches of a suspect 's items after arrest			1
home searches generally require warrants and are given greater constitutional protection than vehicles or a person in public			1
of the two cases addressed by the @entity0 , @entity115 's attracted the most scrutiny			1
two convictions he was detained in 2009 for having an expired vehicle registration and driving with a suspended license			0
when authorities impounded his vehicle , loaded weapons were found hidden under the hood			0
after the college student 's subsequent arrest , @entity127 police took a look at his smartphone			1
text messages , contacts and video in the touch - screen device led officers to believe @entity115 had organized crime connections			0
a photograph of another vehicle owned by the suspect was linked to an earlier drive - by shooting			0
he was convicted in state court and received a 15 - year prison sentence			0
separately , @entity145 was arrested in 2007 for selling two packets of crack cocaine			0
he had an old - style flip phone in his pocket , and police in @entity151 used call logs on the device to trace his real home address , after the suspect gave a bogus one			0
there , officers with a search warrant found more drugs , a weapon and ammunition			1
@entity145 was convicted in federal court and is serving 22 years			0
in neither case did police seek a warrant before the phones were searched			1
one appeals court upheld @entity115 's conviction , and another tossed out @entity145 's			0
broader impact unclear from the high court 's ruling is whether other defendants convicted on such electronic evidence will also have their cases dismissed			1
but the court minced no words in separating such devices from other things a person might have on them when detained by police			0
" modern cell phones , as a category , implicate privacy concerns far beyond those implicated by the search of a cigarette pack , a wallet , or a purse , " said chief justice @entity181			2
" cell phones differ in both a quantitative and a qualitative sense from other objects that might be kept on an arrestee 's person			0
" the @entity197 's @entity196 protects against " unreasonable searches and seizures			2
" but the @entity0 has repeatedly affirmed the government 's discretion to conduct warrantless initial pat - downs and searches of people and vehicles -- to ensure officers ' safety and prevent destruction of evidence			1
that included a 1973 ruling upholding the police search of a suspect 's crumpled cigarette box , where heroin capsules were discovered			0
the motorist had first been stopped on suspicion of driving on a suspended license in @entity219			0
cellphones different similar law enforcement searches can include other closed containers , such as wallets and address books , even if it is not initially apparent the items are contraband or dangerous			2
but privacy advocates and defense attorneys had argued that portable , easily storable technology makes these appeals different			2
the court , in sweeping terms , agreed			2
in april : court seemingly at odds over cell phones and searches opinion : what @entity239 knows about illegal searches @entity242 : cell phone ruling keeps cops out of your business			2

the cases reviewed involved searches without a warrant following an arrest
the unanimous decision was a sweeping endorsement for privacy rights
most people in the @entity92 own a cellphone
