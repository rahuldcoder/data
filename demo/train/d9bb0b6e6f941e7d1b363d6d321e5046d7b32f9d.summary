-- now is not the time to repeal the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy on gay men and lesbians serving openly in the @entity9 armed forces , sen. @entity1 said at a hearing thursday			1
" at this time , we should be inherently cautious about making any changes that would affect our military , and what changes we do make should be the product of careful and deliberate consideration , " the @entity11 @entity10 said at the @entity13 hearing			2
his position is not that the law should never be changed , he said , but that " it may be premature to make such a change at this time and in this manner			1
" in contrast , defense secretary @entity25 urged that the repeal be signed into law as soon as possible , to avoid the issue being taken up again by the judiciary , where a repeal of the ban could be ordered immediately , rather than on the military 's timetable			1
a judicial fiat would be " hazardous , " he added			2
" this can be done , and should be done , " @entity25 said of the policy change			1
@entity1 questioned the results of a report that found that most military personnel would not change their career plans if the policy was changed , saying that only a fraction of military personnel responded			1
he also noted that the survey found opposition to the change is much higher in @entity48 and @entity50 combat units than elsewhere in the military			2
the chairman of the @entity53 , adm. @entity52 , said he believes that even among those combat forces , a transition to a new law is possible			1
" should repeal occur , some soldiers and @entity50 may want separate shower facilities			2
some may ask for different berthing			2
some may even quit the service			0
we 'll deal with that			2
but i believe , and history tells , that most of them will put aside personal proclivities for something larger than themselves and for each other , " he said			0
in a tense exchange between @entity25 and @entity1 , the defense secretary reiterated @entity52 's point			1
" most of the @entity50 who are in combat are 18 to 24 [ or ] 25 years old			0
most of the them have never served with women , either			0
so they have had a very focused , very limited experience in the military and it 's been a tough one , " @entity25 said			1
" but i think that with time and adequate preparation we can mitigate their concerns			0
" @entity1 responded , " well , i could n't disagree more			1
we send these young people into combat			0
we think they are mature enough to fight and die			0
i think they are mature enough to make a judgment on who they want to serve with and the impact on their battle effectiveness			0
" @entity1 was upset that the military survey did not ask explicitly whether troops were in favor or against repealing " do n't ask , do n't tell			1
" the questions asked how military units would respond and adapt if it were repealed			0
@entity25 and @entity52 argued that asking troops for their opinions on the repeal would be akin to a referendum on the policy , something that @entity52 called a " bad precedent			1
" the argument did not sway @entity1			1
he said that any good leader should get opinions from his subordinates before making a decision			2
" i 'm almost incredulous to see that on an issue of this magnitude , we would n't at least solicit the views of the military about whether this law would be changed or not , " he said			0
@entity52 responded that the survey that was done gave an adequate amount of opinion , even if the question was not directly asked			0
" we 've gotten in great parts their views as a result of this survey , " @entity52 said			0
on friday , the committee will hear from the top brass of the @entity48 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity50			0
while a @entity134 survey showed that 58 percent of the public support repealing the ban , the heads of the four military branches have either directly opposed or been unenthusiastic about the policy change , at least until the @entity141 report was finished and released			1
@entity142 commandant @entity142 has said that he opposes the change while the @entity9 is fighting in @entity144 because of its potential negative effect on unit cohesion			2
he will be joined on the second day of hearings by another @entity50 , the vice chairman of the @entity53 , @entity149 gen. @entity149			1
once the @entity13 's hearings are over , the spotlight will turn to senate majority leader @entity152 , @entity153			0
he will decide how the issue will move forward : whether to keep it as part of the @entity157 or strip it off for a separate vote			0
with just weeks left for this @entity161 , the calendar could be the biggest factor weighing on whether the law is repealed or upheld			1
the @entity164 has already passed the repeal .			0

new : troops ' opinions on policy should have been solicited , sen. @entity1 says
defense secretary @entity25 : change should come from @entity161 , not the courts
@entity53 chairman : @entity176 will deal with whatever *fallout* results from the change
