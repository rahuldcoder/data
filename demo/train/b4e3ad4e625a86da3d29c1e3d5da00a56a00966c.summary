-- @entity1 and @entity2 have announced that they will conclude their nine - year endorsement deal at the end of december			1
world number one @entity1 is happy to have more ' personal time ' with wife @entity8 expecting their second child			1
the parties agreed to a " mutual and amicable separation " that included a desire for more personal time for 14 - time major winner @entity15 whose wife @entity8 is expecting their second child			1
and @entity2 say the company is searching for " budget efficiencies " during a difficult economy			1
world no. 1 @entity15 has endorsed @entity2 products around the world for the past nine years and has been heavily associated with the @entity25 brand in the @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 markets			2
the endorsement deal , believed to be worth at least $ 7 million a year , was to end in 2009			2
@entity15 ' agent at @entity32 , @entity33 , said the decision to end the relationship one year early was " absolutely mutual			0
" " it was a combination of things , " @entity33 said			0
" @entity1 was looking to gain some more time , and certainly it was an opportunity for @entity2 to reduce its spending with everything going on			1
" @entity2 's vice president for @entity43 sales , @entity41 , says the separation is the result of discussions earlier in the year and is not related to the company 's campaign for $ 25 billion in loans from the federal government			1
in a web site statement , @entity1 commented , " i am very proud of the long standing partnership i 've had with @entity2 and have enjoyed being a part of the company 's dramatic product evolution			1
" we 've had a lot of fun together and i participated in some unique and rewarding activities			0
we 've enjoyed a tremendous partnership over the years and we will maintain strong ties with the many people at @entity2 we call friends			2
" @entity1 has yet to decide when he will be fit to return to the circuit following knee surgery after winning the @entity66 in june at @entity67			0
there has been speculation it could be early february for the defense of his @entity72 title on a course -- @entity67 -- where he has won five straight events " that 's the most frustrating thing for me , because i do n't know , " @entity1 said recently			0
" i like having things planned out			0
i like understanding what i need to shoot for , but i do n't know			0
" and the surgeons do n't know , either , because they 've never dealt with an injury like this for a person who plays golf at an elite level			0
