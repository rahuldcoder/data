-- @entity1 has announced its choice for the best album of 2014			1
and it may also be the most hated album of 2014			0
the honor goes to @entity7 's " @entity6 , " which annoyed many listeners in september when it was automatically sent to the accounts of 500 million active @entity11 users , without their consent , as part of an @entity15 promotion			1
although the album was free , some users grumbled that the distribution method was invasive			0
frontman @entity19 later apologized , saying the band " got carried away with ourselves			0
" " there was no bigger album of 2014 -- in terms of surprise , generosity and controversy , " @entity1 's editors said monday in defending their choice			1
" @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 put their lives on the line : giving away 11 songs of guitar rapture and frank , emotional tales of how they became a band out of the rough streets and spiritual ferment of @entity42			0
" much of the @entity43 , however , howled in laughter and protest			0
" @entity7 actually just appeared on the @entity1 @entity49 list and @entity1 did n't know how to delete it , " wrote one @entity47 user			1
" in case anyone was wondering if @entity1 's opinions on music were still relevant , they named @entity7 's new album the best of the year , so ... " said another			1
as a pop - culture magazine founded in the 1960s , @entity1 is often viewed as being less daring in its tastes than online rivals such as @entity60 , which gave " @entity6 " a 4.6 out of 10			2
although @entity7 remains one of the biggest artists in the world , the band 's popularity has slumped over the past decade			2
" @entity73 " has received little airplay and mixed responses from critics , reflected by its score of 65 out of 100 on @entity71 , which aggregates reviews			2
in ranking their top 50 albums of the year , @entity1 chose @entity7 over high - profile releases from @entity77 ( # 2 ) , @entity78 ( # 3 ) , @entity79 ( # 10 ) and others			1
many of 2014 's top sellers , including releases by @entity84 , @entity85 and @entity86 , did not make the list .			0

@entity1 names @entity7 's " @entity73 " the best album of the year
