@entity0 -- a @entity3 man who admitted plotting to blow up the @entity4 in a suicide attack was offered " martyrdom payments " for his parents by his undercover @entity11 handlers , according to the man 's lawyers			1
@entity12 , 29 , will be sentenced friday and under the terms of a plea agreement he 'll receive a sentence ranging from 25 to 30 years			1
in a sentencing memo filed friday , @entity12 's lawyers argued for the lower sentence and stressed he received financial support which freed him up to participate in a plot			2
the document said @entity12 was financially strapped living in @entity22 and worried about sending money home to his parents in @entity3 , who had suffered financial reversals			2
two men @entity12 knew as @entity33 and @entity34 " promised to take care of mr. @entity12 's family in @entity3 by sending them $ 500 per month to commence after the attack was completed , " according to @entity12 's lawyers			1
the document also states @entity12 was given rent and grocery money amounting to at least $ 5,700 from september 2011 to february 2012			0
@entity12 thought the men could assist him in a terror plot , but they were actually @entity11 agents			1
@entity12 was arrested on february 17th after he had take possession of what he thought was a suicide vest and a @entity44 - 10 semiautomatic handgun			1
both had been rendered inoperable by the @entity11			0
the defense lawyers contend their client , who pleaded guilty in june , " bears no ill - will against the @entity49 people " and believed @entity50 had called on him to commit a violent act			2
" he is relieved that his attempted crime was foiled and that no one was actually injured , " according to the court filing			0
according to the lawyers , the actions of the @entity11 do not constitute entrapment			0
however , the lawyers said @entity12 was " enabled by the @entity11 , who as part of its ' sting , ' helped mr. @entity12 with the means , method and motivation for the attack			1
" the @entity11 and the @entity66 for the @entity67 would not comment on whether the @entity11 promised @entity12 " martyrdom payments " as part of its ruse			1
however , prosecutors filed their own sentencing memo arguing @entity12 should get the higher sentence of 30 years			0
" the defendant , on his own initiative , selected the target and date of the attack , and engaged in surveillance to ensure that his attack caused maximum casualties , " the prosecutors wrote			0
according to the government , it is very lucky the @entity11 and not actual extremists came into the picture and started working with @entity12			2
" there is every reason to believe that he would have taken any opportunity he encountered in the future to commit mass murder , " said the prosecution 's filing			0
@entity12 " eventually would have encountered such opportunities outside the presence of undercover @entity11 agents			1
" the ' lone wolf ' -- the unknowable face of terror			0
