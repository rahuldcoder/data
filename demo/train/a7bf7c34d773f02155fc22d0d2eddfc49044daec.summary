by the big smiles , warm hugs and loud cries of ululation , the video seems to show a joyous celebration			2
an @entity7 prosecutor looked at the same footage and saw something very different : a " satanic ceremony " with images that are " shameful , regrettable and anger @entity12			1
" however it is characterized , the event has landed eight men in jail for three years , an @entity7 court ruled saturday			1
the men will face three years of probation upon their release , according to @entity7 's state - run @entity21			1
it 's all because of a roughly 1 - minute video set upon a @entity25 riverboat			1
it shows several well - dressed men , one of which pulls out a ring and slips it on another man 's finger			2
the two had a brief kiss , then hug -- all as others on the boat cry out happily around them			0
there 's a cake with two men 's picture on it			0
" may your night be filled with pomp and ceremony , " one man says			2
the video went viral after posting online			1
in early september , the suspects were detained as part of an investigation ordered by prosecutor - general @entity50 for allegedly broadcasting footage that " violates public decency			2
" the prosecutor 's office accused the men of " debauchery " and " undermining public morals " for their part in what it described as a same - sex wedding			1
the prosecutor 's statement claims the event took place in april , but was only recently posted as an act of revenge against one of the men filmed in the video			2
very soon after , on september 8 , @entity7 's forensic authority announced that seven of the arrested men had been physically inspected and were determined to be " not gay , " according to another @entity21 story			1
the authority 's spokesman , @entity74 , said the inspection found that they " have never had sex with other men			0
" the eighth suspect -- who was an alleged groom in the video -- did n't show up for a physical inspection , according to the report			0
a man in the video has denied , in an interview with privately owned @entity87 , that it depicted a marriage between the two men			0
rather , he claimed that he was holding a birthday party for a friend and gave him a silver ring as a gift			0
there are no laws explicitly against same - sex relations in @entity7			1
still , other laws -- such as those against " shameless public acts " -- have been used in recent years to arrest and prosecute gay men in recent years , @entity21 notes			0
the eight men in this case , for instance , were convicted on charges of " debauchery			0
" in september , a judicial source told @entity21 that six men were arrested and soon thereafter sentenced to two years in jail with labor for " committing debauchery " after an apartment raid			0
four men were sentenced to prison in april for similar morality charges			0
and in 2001 , @entity7 arrested more than 50 men in a raid on a gay nightclub on the @entity120 riverboat .			1

eight arrested after an online video showed what authorities called a same - sex wedding
a prosecutor called it a " satanic ceremony " with images that are " shameful *...* and anger @entity12 "
*homosexuality* is not explicitly *outlawed* in @entity7 ; gays have been charged in other ways
