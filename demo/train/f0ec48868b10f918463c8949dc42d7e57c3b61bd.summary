-- the people of @entity2 are coming to terms with the first suicide bombing on their soil , an attack which stunned the nation and in the words of the country 's foreign minister could have been " catastrophic			1
" authorities say that only the premature detonation of @entity14 's device likely prevented many others from being killed			0
" fifty , 60 , 70 people could have been killed -- this was not amateur hour , " @entity16 , a terrorism expert at the @entity17 , told @entity0			0
the incident did not surprise counter-terrorism experts			0
" for some time @entity2 officials have been worried about a growing threat , both from overseas terrorists and from home - grown extremists within the country , " says @entity23 , a @entity24 terrorism expert , who has extensively researched @entity26 militants in @entity27			1
at the heart of @entity2 's unwanted newfound status : cartoons			1
three years ago , @entity38 published an image of the @entity40 in a @entity2 newspaper			1
@entity2 became an object of jihadist hate just as @entity24 did in 2005 after the publication in a newspaper there of caricatures of the @entity40			1
in march 2010 authorities in @entity48 and the @entity49 broke up a plot to murder @entity38			0
one of those allegedly involved was @entity52 , a @entity53 woman who identified herself online as @entity52			0
@entity52 has pled not guilty to providing material support to terrorists			0
in july ' @entity57 ' magazine , an online magazine from @entity60 's @entity59 arm , put @entity61 at the top of an assassination list			0
and a few weeks ago @entity64 , @entity60 's affiliate in @entity65 , released a video in which a @entity2 member exhorted @entity2 militants to kill @entity38			1
these threats follow an audiotape back in 2007 from @entity71 , then a senior figure in @entity60 in @entity73 , who promised " a reward of $ 100,000 for anybody who kills this @entity78 criminal			0
this reward will be raised to $ 150,000 if he is slaughtered like a lamb			0
" @entity82 also called for attacks against @entity2 businesses , including @entity85			1
there 's an ironic twist in the mention of @entity85			0
back in the 1970s @entity90 went on vacation to @entity2 because an older brother was trying to buy @entity85 trucks for the @entity90 family construction company			1
during downtime , the brothers liked nothing better than to speed through the @entity2 countryside in the family @entity100			2
and for a long while , @entity2 got a pass from international jihadists			2
in an october 2004 videotape @entity60 's leader disputed president @entity107 's accusation that @entity60 hated freedom by retorting : " let him tell us why we did not strike @entity2 , for example			2
@entity2 authorities say emails sent by @entity114 just before the attempted attack cited @entity2 's tolerance of the @entity118 cartoon as one of the reasons he was targeting the country			1
he also said the attack was due to the continued presence of @entity2 troops in @entity126			2
@entity2 , though not a member of @entity128 , currently has around 500 troops in @entity126 assisting the @entity128 mission			2
investigators are still untangling 28 year old @entity114 's path to radicalism			0
his family left @entity73 in the early 1990s and settled in @entity2			2
in 2001 , at the age of 19 , he visited @entity136 to study and settled in @entity138 - a town in southern @entity136 identified in a leaked @entity140 intelligence report two years ago as having one of the main concentrations of @entity144 extremists in the country			1
for many young muslims in @entity147 the last decade has been unsettling , with the wars in @entity73 and @entity126 leading to a perception that their religion is under attack			0
@entity114 seems to have subscribed to this view , according to religious leaders at an @entity155 in @entity138			0
they said he was unwelcome because of his extreme views			0
the @entity2 authorities will now be taking a fresh look at radical islamists in the country			1
in october @entity2 raised its terrorist threat level to " elevated " based on security services ' finding that there had been " a shift in activities among certain groups in @entity2 , judged to be targeted at @entity2			1
" among @entity2 's estimated 300,000 muslims , the vast majority have no time for @entity60 's extremist message			1
but a radical fringe has emerged , especially amongst younger immigrants , and the children of immigrants			2
according to @entity27 counter-terrorism expert @entity23 , the radical extremist fringe is more fragmented in @entity2 than in some other @entity147 countries such as @entity140 where a nationwide network of extremists has emerged			1
but clusters of militants are increasingly on the radar of @entity2 's counter-terrorism services			2
@entity2 counter-terrorism sources tell @entity0 more than 100 are being monitored			2
their attention has focused on an extremist fringe within @entity2 's @entity187 , which has been relatively isolated from the rest of society , and is a cause of major concern			1
a growing number of @entity2 citizens of @entity65 descent have gone to @entity65 to join @entity64			1
just last week two @entity2 citizens of @entity65 descent were sentenced for " planning terrorist crimes " in @entity65			1
according to @entity23 , more than 20 @entity2 citizens are believed by @entity2 security services to be fighting with @entity64 in @entity65			1
some have become prominent - like @entity200 , who preached an extremist message in a @entity203 mosque in the early 1990s and once fought in @entity126			0
swedes have also traveled to other @entity205 fronts in recent years , including @entity73			0
a report by @entity2 's intelligence agency due out wednesday is expected to highlight the domestic threat posed by @entity2 who have received terrorist training , according to the @entity2 newspaper @entity210			2
several @entity2 militants have also made the trip to @entity60 's safe haven in the @entity126 - @entity215 border region , according to counter-terrorism officials			2
in august 2009 four @entity2 were arrested by @entity215 security services as they tried to enter the tribal agency of @entity219			0
" travel to @entity215 is becoming a big concern for @entity2 counter-terrorism services , " @entity2 terrorism expert @entity16 told @entity0			1
in another link to @entity215 , @entity2 counter-terrorism sources tell @entity0 that a @entity2 militant -- still being monitored by security services in the country -- played a key role in a terrorist network linked to @entity231 , an @entity49 jihadist , plotting an attack against a @entity24 newspaper last year			1
@entity231 , who says he working with @entity235 , a @entity215 @entity60 operative , has pleaded guilty to the plot			0
now @entity2 's counter-terrorism agencies have another case to investigate			0
did @entity114 have any help or co-conspirators in @entity2 ? where did he obtain the explosives he used in the attack ? " we more or less consider it as a given that he had outside help in some way , at least before he reached the point of execution , " a @entity2 police spokesman said monday			0
the question is : who , where and when .			0

cartoons of the @entity40 are at the heart of @entity2 being targeted by @entity144
authorities say weekend bombing was not amateurish and could have been *devastating*
@entity2 authorities will now be taking a fresh look at radical islamists in the country
