@entity0 has no athletes at the @entity2 , and skiing is not the first thing that springs to mind when thinking about the isolated nation			2
that 's why tour operators are billing @entity0 's luxury new @entity8 as " the most exotic ski resort on @entity10			1
" located in @entity17 province , the hotel and resort -- the only one of its kind in the country -- opened january 1 after a series of reported setbacks			1
earlier this year , @entity20 reported on the experience of one of the first visitors to the resort , @entity25 , from @entity27 - based @entity26			0
more recently we spoke to another visitor , snowboarding journalist @entity30 , whose video of her @entity33 trip is shown above			1
surprised by the caliber of the equipment at the resort , @entity30 also notes that she got to chat to ordinary @entity0 -- because her government minders could n't ski			1
@entity38 made a failed bid to co-host the @entity40 when @entity41 held the games in 1988			0

" along with 11 ski runs , there are 120 hotel rooms housed in two buildings , a swimming pool , bars , caf√©s , billiard tables , a karaoke room , a steam room and a dry sauna			1
local tour guides speak @entity67 but do n't tend to ski ; for the large number of ski instructors , you 'd need a translator			0
the resort is " clearly built for locals , " @entity25 said , although it was expected to draw some foreigners coming with tour operators such as his own			1
" the number of local @entity79 skiers was a surprise , considering that [ before @entity33 opened ] there was just one ski slope in the country -- and in a very remote and hard to reach area , " @entity25 said			1
at the time of writing , foreigners could n't book at @entity88 directly but would have to come with a group tour			0
controversial construction " we 're aware of the controversies surrounding [ @entity33 ] , " wrote @entity25 on the @entity26 blog			0
