-- will feature new recordings of @entity6 covering the @entity11 , @entity1 and more , producers tell @entity2			1
the film will not , however , include any songs written by @entity4 , the rights to which are controlled by the late guitarist 's estate			1
last month , @entity18 , which oversees the @entity4 estate , issued a statement regarding the movie , which has been in production for four months			1
the company , which is run by @entity4 's sister @entity24 , said that it " has made it known many times in the past that no such film , were it to include original music or copyrights created by @entity4 , can be undertaken without its full participation			1
" instead , the film -- set in @entity33 in 1966 and 1967 -- will include @entity6 's new versions of covers that @entity4 performed during those years , shortly before the release of his landmark debut , " are you experienced			1
" audiences will see @entity6 singing " @entity40 " ( which @entity4 famously performed in a @entity33 club with members of the @entity11 in the audience ) , " @entity44 , " " @entity45 , " @entity1 ' " mannish boy " and @entity48 ' " @entity47 , " plus two songs , " @entity50 " and " @entity51 , " that @entity4 played as a backup musician for @entity53 and the @entity54			1
the remakes were cut in @entity56 by a session - legend power trio including @entity58 ( who 's played guitar for @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 ) , @entity63 ( bassist for @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 ) , and @entity68 ( former @entity70 drummer )			0
@entity71 , a longtime music supervisor who won a @entity72 for his work on the " @entity75 " soundtrack , oversaw the music			0
" @entity9 " is currently shooting in @entity77 , @entity5 , where co-producer @entity78 says it was " easier ... to recreate 1967 @entity33			1
" principal photography is expected to wrap this week , and producers then hope to take the film to @entity82 in early 2013 for possible release next year			0
a soundtrack album featuring the @entity6 - sung covers is also in discussion			2
" @entity6 has been @entity4 for four months now , " @entity78 says			1
" he speaks and walks like @entity4			2
he dropped a ton of weight			0
the transformation has been amazing			0
" if the movie were to include songs @entity4 wrote , like " @entity93 " or " @entity94 , " the producers would have needed permission from @entity18 , which owns the copyrights to the material			1
but according to @entity78 , the film was always set in @entity4 ' pre-fame era , so neither he or his team ever approached the @entity4 estate			1
" this is the story of @entity4 being discovered as a backup musician and how he went to @entity33 and became @entity4 , " says the producer			2
@entity78 says that focusing on early stories about @entity4 -- like the times he jammed with @entity107 and met @entity108 -- is preferable to a biopic about @entity4 's full life story			1
" that would be like making a movie about @entity113 , " he says			0
" we all know how that story ends			0
" a spokesperson for @entity18 tells @entity2 that the company had no idea the movie would include @entity121 songs			2
" they want to make a @entity4 movie without @entity4 music , " says the estate representative			2
" it would be like making a movie about @entity128 without being able to use the @entity129			0
" music industry sources confirm that the filmmakers are legally in the clear as long as licenses are in place for the @entity121 songs			0
" they 're absolutely in the right as long as they got the licenses for those songs , " says @entity134 , a music business lawyer who represents the estates of @entity136 and @entity137			0
" they do n't need to get the approval of the @entity4 estate for that			2
