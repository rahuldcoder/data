-- those aboard an @entity3 airplane from @entity4 got to see a little more of @entity5 than they expected friday , after their flight was diverted to @entity9 , @entity10 , due to engine trouble			1
@entity12 took off from @entity13 at 3 p.m. ( 10 a.m. et ) , destined for @entity14 , @entity15 , according to @entity3 ' website			2
the @entity18 777 - 200 airliner made it over the @entity5 , but not to its final destination			0
it was diverted to @entity9 due to an issue with the plane 's left engine , @entity3 spokeswoman @entity21 told @entity0			1
she did not specify what the issue was			0
its flight crew declared an emergency before landing at @entity9 's airport shortly after 6:30 p.m. ct ( 7:30 p.m. et )			1
one problem -- besides whatever happened to the left engine -- is that @entity9 's airport does n't have @entity34 workers on hand to handle incoming international travelers			1
that means the aircraft 's 230 passengers and 14 crew members have to wait on the airport 's tarmac , according to @entity43			2
the aircraft that will take them to @entity14 was set to leave that @entity15 city around 9:15 p.m. for @entity9			2
according to @entity5 's website , it should have @entity12 's passengers and presumably crew on board when it departs @entity10 at 10 p.m. if all goes according to plan -- this time around -- this aircraft should arrive at @entity53 a few minutes after 11 p.m. local time			0
for those keeping score at home , that amounts to 14 hours after @entity12 's passengers first took off from @entity4			0
@entity0 's @entity59 contributed to this report .			0

@entity62 *79* took off from @entity4 , destined for @entity14
spokeswoman : its crew declared an emergency due to a left engine issue
the 777 had to sit on the tarmac because @entity9 did n't have @entity34 *agents*
a new aircraft will pick up the passengers and *fly* them to @entity15
