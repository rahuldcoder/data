-- if @entity2 is a day you look forward to with great anticipation each year , if it is a day that you equate with excitement and good times , there 's something you should know : you may have a politician to thank for your happy feelings			2
on the other hand , if @entity2 is a day you dread each year , if you are dismayed by the notion that the day has turned into a lockstep secular holiday during which most of the nation seems hypnotized for hours on end , there 's something you should know : you may have a politician to blame for your grumpy feelings			2
in both cases , it 's the same politician : president @entity20			1
a persuasive argument can be made that , were it not for what @entity20 did during a meeting in the @entity24 toward the end of 1905 , football as we know it today would not be a part of @entity31 life			1
there never would have been a @entity33 -- at least not the wildly popular @entity33 that has become such a sports , business and cultural institution -- and @entity31 would almost certainly be spending @entity2 sunday in a completely different way			0
here 's the short version of what happened : early in the 20th century , football , as played on college gridirons , was something close to a street fight			1
the rules were lax at best , and were routinely ignored			1
during the 1905 season alone , 18 college and amateur players died			0
and despite the growing violence ( or , who knows , maybe because of the growing violence ) , fans were flocking to the games -- the sport was gaining followers			2
so , if the fans liked what they were seeing , what was the problem ? the problem was that a serious movement was afoot to ban the sport -- to get rid of football			1
remember , the @entity33 did not exist -- the college game was the top level of the sport			2
@entity66 's president , @entity65 , was leading the charge to abolish football , and it began to look as if he and his allies had a chance of doing just that			1
to give you an idea of just how seriously the get - rid - of - football movement was being taken , the @entity72 ran an editorial expressing concern over " @entity78 " in @entity31 life : lynchings and football			2
there is ample historical documentation of what @entity20 did , but as my guide through the thicket that football entered and from which it eventually emerged and thrived , i sought the assistance of author @entity91 , whose meticulously researched book , " @entity92 : how @entity20 saved @entity95 , " is the gold standard			1
@entity20 , @entity91 told me , loved football , but had never played the game -- by the time he was president , @entity20 cut a brawny , outdoorsmanlike , hemingwayesque figure ( well , @entity100 had n't been heard of in those years , but you get the picture ) , yet as a boy he was small , sickly and wore eyeglasses			1
when he was serving in the @entity24 and football was under fire , he wanted the game to survive , " but he realized that the critics had a point			2
... he loved the sport and thought it was great , but he recognized there was a threat to it			0
... he was concerned that we would lose the game			0
" thus , @entity20 convened a meeting in the @entity24 of the most influential men in college football			1
@entity120 were @entity121 , the leading figure in the formative years of the game , as well as representatives from @entity66 , @entity125 and @entity126			0
according to @entity91 , @entity20 told them : " football is on trial			1
because i believe in the game , i want to do all i can to save it			0
" he impressed on them that genuine , substantive changes must be instituted			0
@entity91 said that @entity20 did not use the " big stick " -- he did not threaten and he did not pound the table			2
" i see nothing but levelheadedness on @entity20 's part , " @entity91 said			1
" he was a great politician			0
he knew how to negotiate and make a point			0
" ( @entity20 , after all , would win the @entity140 for negotiating a treaty between @entity142 and @entity143 , who went to war in 1904 )			2
with the football men , @entity91 told me , @entity148 certainly had " sufficient skills to bring people to the table and bring concessions and agreement			0
there was some resistance during and after the meeting , but eventually football 's leaders would agree to get rid of many of the elements that had turned the sport into all - but - unregulated brutality			1
@entity165 - style mass formations , and gang tackling , were outlawed ; the distance needed for a first down was changed from five yards to ten , which made it essential to come up with plays that did n't necessarily go straight through the center of the line ; a neutral zone was instituted at the line of scrimmage ; and -- most important -- a new kind of play was put into the rulebook : the forward pass			0
" it revolutionized the game , " @entity91 said			0
" it spread out the action			0
it opened up the field			0
" football became more thrilling to watch ; the college game boomed , the @entity33 was born			0
speaking of which : with today 's new concerns about football violence and long - term injuries , could a president in the 21st century convene a meeting to try to accomplish what @entity20 did ? @entity194 doubts it			1
" one reason a president of the @entity31 might not get involved is fear of public failure , " he said			0
there was no internet when @entity20 brought the football men to the @entity24 ; there was no television ; there were no radios in @entity31 homes			1
he had been able to pull the whole thing off relatively quietly			0
if football leaders were called to the @entity24 today , the whole country would know it in advance , and for any president , " the risk of getting involved at that level is the risk of not succeeding			1
" so , i asked , on @entity2 , what is the proper way to regard @entity20 ? it 's simple , @entity91 said : " he was football 's indispensable fan			1
" join the conversation on @entity222 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			2

@entity225 says we may have @entity20 to thank for football as we know it
he says lax rules and high injury in the early 1900 's prompted a call to ban the sport
he says @entity20 *intervened* to persuade teams to formalize rules , hence cutting injury
@entity225 : expert writer on the subject says not likely a president today could pull this off
