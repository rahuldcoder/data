-- there are n't too many times when i 'm speechless about what i consider an outrageous example of parenting			2
this is one of those times			0
an @entity9 photo surfaced over the weekend of a child wearing a @entity12 costume and dragging a doll ostensibly meant to symbolize the wife of the embattled former @entity16 star , @entity15			1
( the person who posted the photo with the caption " greatest costume ever " appears to have since taken down their @entity9 account			1
) as most of us sadly know by now from the surveillance video that has been seen around the world , @entity12 dragged his then - fiancee out of an elevator after knocking her out in february			2
and so a kids ' costume of @entity12 dragging his wife ? are you kidding me ? thankfully , some parents across the country have the words i ca n't seem to find			1
@entity36 costumes to avoid this year " utterly disgusting ! " is what @entity37 , a father of two young daughters and organizer of the @entity40 , called " the seemingly celebratory suggestion of domestic violence in dragging around a @entity15 doll			1
" " not just insensitive			0
idiotic ! dangerous ! disgraceful ! " said @entity37 , who is also the founder of the blog at - @entity47			0
on @entity52 , @entity48 , a mom of two boys in @entity50 , @entity51 , said she would never let her little guys wear something " so tasteless			0
" " what 's the purpose ? to be funny ? to shock ? to show zero class ? what is the lesson here ? " she asked			2
this @entity12 costume for kids is just the latest example of what seems to be a trend in wildly inappropriate children 's @entity36 costumes , with selections ranging from meth dealers @entity69 and @entity71 from @entity75 's " @entity74 " to a baby cigarette to serial killer @entity73			1
5 scary good healthy @entity36 treats on the video - sharing site for tweens called @entity79 , a girl who goes by the name " citykid " was horrified to see costumes such as a " terrorist " and a " little @entity85			1
" " people actually made these for their kids to wear , " she said incredulously			0
" just because it 's @entity36 that does n't mean you can cross these kinds of lines			1
" well said , citykid			0
she also pointed out the growing popularity of oversexualized costumes for our girls			2
" by making these costumes manufacturers are encouraging tween girls to dress twice their age			1
" @entity101 , a mom of two and author of " @entity103 , " said it is " especially concerning " when hypersexualized costumes " dominate the girls market			1
" @entity107 , princess - y and sexy too soon " it reflects a litmus test of our society and conveys the message to girls they are valued for their looks , " said @entity101 , who is also the founder and chief executive officer of @entity110 , which offers empowering t - shirts for girls and boys			0
" instead of dressing like a true fire fighter / super hero / doctor / bug / witch , they face row after row of the sexy version of those things , size @entity128 , " @entity101 said			0
" while a little girl may not understand what ' sexy ' is , the older children and adults around her certainly do , and it impacts the way we talk to and respond to girls			0
" @entity139 , host of the blog whatevs , said she 's seen costumes such as a " sexy mermaid " or a " sexy @entity144 beverage " for children on @entity146			2
" basically , anything that could be described as ' sexy ' is inappropriate for a young girl , " said @entity139 , who blogs about motherhood , fitness , home birth and life in @entity151 , @entity152			0
as for how a parent can draw the line between what 's inappropriate and what 's ok for children to wear on @entity36 , @entity139 , in my humble opinion , had some great advice			1
" i would ask myself if this costume is getting a laugh at anyone 's expense			2
if so , that costume is probably not ok , " she said			0
" is the costume sexy ? if my child has not yet hit puberty , that 's a clear line that the costume is not ok			1
is the costume making light of violence ? that costume is not ok			0
" do you think the child costume of @entity12 dragging a doll is inappropriate for children ? tell @entity182 on @entity183 or @entity184 on @entity52 .			1

a photo of a child in a @entity12 costume dragging a @entity15 doll surfaced on @entity9
" utterly disgusting " is the sentiment shared by many parents about the costume
many parents say hypersexualized costumes for girls are also inappropriate
" just because it 's @entity36 that does n't mean you can cross these kinds of lines , " said one tween
