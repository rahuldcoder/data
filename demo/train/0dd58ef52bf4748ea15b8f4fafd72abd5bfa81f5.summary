@entity0 -- some may disagree whether @entity2 was a " uniter , not a divider , " as he liked to say , but he did get all five living presidents together for the dedication of his presidential library			1
at thursday 's event in @entity0 , @entity10 former presidents @entity8 and @entity11 praised @entity2 for his initiatives in @entity14 , and @entity2 defended his record			1
" the political winds blow left and right , polls rise and fall , supporters come and go , but in the end , leaders are defined by the convictions they hold , " @entity2 said at the ceremony for the @entity17			1
" my deepest conviction , the guiding principle of the administration , is that the @entity27 must strive to expand the reach of freedom			0
" @entity2 has said he is aware that the opening of his presidential library would reopen debates over the @entity32 and the policies he pursued after the september 11 terrorist attacks			1
history will show , he said at the dedication , that he always stuck by his convictions			0
" a free society thrives when neighbors help neighbors and the strong protect the weak and public policies promote private compassion , " @entity2 said			1
" as president , i tried to act on these principles every day			0
it was n't always easy and certainly was n't always popular ... but when future generations come to this library to study this administration , they 're going to find out that we stayed true to our convictions			0
" @entity8 told a story of how he asked , on @entity2 's inauguration day , for a meeting to talk about a civil war in @entity56 that was entering its second decade			1
@entity2 kept his word and acted , @entity8 said			1
" in january of 2005 , there was a peace treaty between north and south @entity56 that ended a war that had been going on for 20 years , " @entity8 said			1

@entity2 became a little emotional as he closed his speech : " whatever challenges come before us , i will always believe our nation 's best days lie ahead			1
" the center 's library and museum take visitors through the turning points of @entity2 's two terms			1
the first exhibits recall the 43rd president 's initial priorities on education , faith - based community initiatives and tax cuts			2
and they show how the september 11 terrorist attacks changed everything			0
@entity2 43 : ' @entity100 will ultimately judge ' at one exhibit , the bright red dress that first lady @entity102 wore to her husband 's first state dinner , just six days before 9/11 , stands in contrast to the next , most talked - about artifact in the museum : the twisted hulk of two beams from the @entity111			1
in an interview with @entity1 's @entity114 , the former president said he knows that the center 's dedication will rekindle the debate about his presidency , and he conceded the library is in part an effort by him and supporters to influence history 's verdict			1
but he predicted visitors would find it " more objective " than they might have imagined , and he showed little interest in revisiting flashpoints like @entity129 , @entity130 or the 2008 financial crisis , or the scorn with which many look back at the @entity2 presidency			2
a glimpse at a @entity136 before everything changed " you know , i 'm really not that concerned about why people did what during my presidency , " he said			0

i did n't compromise my principles			0

if he could make the decision for @entity157 , he would tell him to run for president , @entity2 said			2
but in an interview thursday on @entity163 's " today , " former first lady @entity161 said that while @entity157 is able to do the job , she would like to see other families in the @entity136			0
