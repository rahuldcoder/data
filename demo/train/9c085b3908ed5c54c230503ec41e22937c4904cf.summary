" there is a very simple but important principle we will continue to fight for today and in the days ahead : transparency			0
" very few details emerged from @entity7 and @entity8 's round , but the fact that @entity57 reporter @entity56 appeared to be tweeting from inside the complex only added to the @entity37 's ire			1
@entity23 deputy press secretary @entity60 responded by releasing a statement defending the secret nature of the meeting			2
" the press access granted by the @entity23 today is entirely consistent with the press access offered for previous presidential golf outings , " it read			1
" it 's also consistent with the press access promised to the @entity70 prior to arrival in @entity14 on friday evening			1
" on saturday , @entity8 is reported to have spent time working on his swing with @entity7 ' former coach @entity74 , who called it an " honor			1
" the 69 - year - old tweeted : " what a great weekend			0
to spend it with the president and have my son @entity81 by my side			2
it does n't get any better than this			0
" @entity8 also played with @entity86 trade representative @entity85 and @entity87 , a @entity88 donor who owns the resort and the @entity90 , according to reports			2
meanwhile , @entity92 won his first ever title on the @entity94 after edging @entity95 out in a playoff at the @entity97 in @entity98 , @entity99			0
the @entity86 , who attended @entity101 , made par on the second extra hole , the 10th , while @entity95 missed a five foot putt to prolong the playoff			0
" to be able to play the tournament was a dream of mine , " @entity92 told the @entity94 website			0
" but to win ? i ca n't describe it			0
it 's so much fun			0
" elsewhere , the draw for the first @entity116 tournament of the year , the @entity113 , has been made , pairing world no. 1 @entity117 , who lost to @entity118 in the final last year , against @entity120 @entity119			1
