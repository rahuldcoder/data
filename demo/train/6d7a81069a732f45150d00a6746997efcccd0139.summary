failed in their appeal against the decision to overturn a ban he had received after testing positive for cocaine			2
the 23 - year - old @entity11 had tested positive for the drug at the @entity13 in @entity14 in march of this year and he was handed a provisional 12 - month ban			1
but an @entity4 panel overturned the ban in july , accepting @entity1 's claim that the substance was only in his system due to him kissing a woman who had taken cocaine at a nightclub			1
the @entity4 and @entity5 chose to appeal that decision with @entity3 , seeking a two - year suspension , with the world number 47 attending a hearing last month			1
a @entity3 press release read : " the @entity3 panel decided to dismiss the appeals after having found that in this particular case @entity1 had not committed any fault or negligence within the meaning of the @entity35			0
" the @entity3 panel also accepted @entity1 's assertion of how traces of cocaine metabolite were found in his urine sample			2
the @entity3 statement continued : " the panel based its ruling on the evidence provided by the experts called by both the player and the @entity4 , who agreed that the amount of cocaine metabolite was so minute that it must have reflected incidental exposure , rather than use in the amounts commonly taken by social users of cocaine			0
" furthermore , it was also established that the player was clearly not a regular cocaine user , even in very small amounts			0
as a consequence , the possibility of contamination became the most plausible explanation justifying the presence of cocaine metabolite in the player 's urine			0
" on a balance of probability , the @entity3 panel concluded that it was more likely than not that the player 's contamination with cocaine resulted , as @entity1 always asserted , from kissing a woman in a nightclub in @entity13 on the day before the anti-doping test and that the player had met the required standards of proof with respect to the way of ingestion			1

@entity1 has been cleared of any wrongdoing by the @entity3
the 23 - year - old @entity11 tested positive for cocaine in a @entity13 nightclub last march
but he appealed his ban , claiming the cocaine was in his system after kissing a woman who had taken the drug
