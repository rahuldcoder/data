[ @entity0 if you have not watched tonight 's series finale of @entity3 , titled " @entity4			1
" major plot spoilers ahead			1
] they were teacher and student			2
father figure and problem child			2
hazmat - suited partners in crime making fat stacks			2
however you viewed @entity21 ( @entity22 ) and @entity23 ( @entity24 ) — and chances are that view changed radically over the last five seasons -- the two men will forever be linked as the heart and corroded soul of @entity32 's meth - making drama @entity3			1
the pair 's relationship flamed out spectacularly in the final season , as @entity23 , realizing that @entity36 was responsible for the near - death of @entity38 , the son of @entity23 's ex-girlfriend , helped @entity40 ( @entity41 ) to ( almost ) bring @entity36 to justice			1
@entity36 sought revenge , first by handing over @entity23 to the @entity44 ( who gave him two scoops of torture and ice cream ) , and then by returning from cold and lonely @entity48 to wipe out @entity23 along with @entity49 ( @entity50 ) and his crew			1
but when @entity36 saw the hideous , ragged condition of his estranged and now - enslaved labmate , who turned out not to be a 50/50 partner in meth manufacturing with these vicious white supremacists , he had an instinctive change of heart and saved @entity23 from the hellfire that they were all going down in			1
what did @entity22 and @entity24 think of the ending of their audacious adventure , which only left one of their characters alive ? read on to find out			1
calling it " 100 percent satisfying , " @entity24 tells @entity68 : " there were thoughts i had that maybe @entity36 will be the only one standing			1
i love that toward the end , @entity36 's there to go on a suicide mission and blow everyone up , including @entity23 , but he sees what they have put him through			1
his hair 's super long , he 's vacant			2
there 's not a soul in him anymore , and [ @entity36 ] decides that he deserves a second chance , so he dives on him			2
he throws himself in front a bullet for him — and it 's kind of beautiful			2
" he adds with a chuckle : " it 's good that @entity36 got his , because he 's an evil , evil man , and he needed to go			2
" in shooting the scene in which @entity23 refuses to shoot @entity36 , @entity24 wound up ( semi- ) fulfilling a desire he 'd possessed for years			1
" i always had the vision of @entity23 pointing a gun to @entity36 's head , i really did , " he explains			1
" i 'm like , ' it 's got to end like this , ' and deep down , i wanted @entity23 to kill @entity36			1
but the closer we got to the end , i realized i did n't want that			2
@entity23 ca n't kill anybody else — even though he ended up killing @entity101			1
but that was really self - defense and he just had to get out of there			2
but it 's good that @entity23 was put through that torture for the past four or five months , put in a hole , because @entity23 's not an innocent person			1
he did some very bad things			2
it 's good that @entity23 was put through that so he did some time , but i believe that he deserved to get away from all of it and just leave			1
you do n't really know where he goes ... " @entity24 has a few ideas , though , about what happened to @entity23			1
" in my mind , he gets the hell out of @entity120 , " he says			2
" he 's like , ' @entity121			2
' i think he probably goes and says bye to @entity38 , if he can , or at least just sees him from a distance and then he leaves			2
maybe @entity124 , maybe @entity125			2
it 's all part of the story			2
" @entity68 : ' @entity3 's ' @entity130 says ' the ending is good , it 's really good ' @entity22 , meanwhile , feels that @entity132 and his writers crafted both a " very satisfying " and " unapologetic " finish to this unforgiving story			1
it 's complete , " he tells @entity68 , explaining that the ending gave both characters an appropriate reunion and send - off			1
" when i see @entity23 , this involuntary sense comes over me , " he says of @entity36			1
" he 's been treated like a dog -- like a beaten dog — and it just shocks me , and impulsively i protect him			0
he 's going off into the sunset			0
it 's fitting that the man who was so put upon and mistreated has a chance			0
and i like how it ends , because it 's not like , ' oh , he 's got the money			0
' no. he 's just got his life , so he has a chance -- just a chance			0
" he believes the finale cemented the notion that @entity3 is " a tragedy of almost @entity160 level			0
... tragedy is not a bunch of bad guys doing bad things : ' oh , they killed the good guys ! ' tragedy is when the bad guys are sympathized , when you realize that it could have gone another way , " he notes			0
" there was hope for them at one time			0
macbeth ! oh ! in its truest sense , our story is a tragedy — an @entity179 tragedy			0
it 's not ' good conquers evil , ' it 's not ' good guys against the bad guys , ' it 's much muddier than that			0
" @entity36 's unplanned self - sacrifice in shielding @entity23 from the bullet not only exposed what humanity was left in @entity21 , but underlined the significance of their relationship , no matter how fractured			1
" [ when ] he hears that the blue meth is still out there , that @entity23 is still cooking , it 's like , ' that bastard ! he convinced them to be a partner with him , he 's still cooking ! i 'll kill everybody ! ' " says @entity22			1
" and then when i see him , the shred of humanity left in @entity21 is exposed at that moment and he acts			1
so if there 's any redeeming quality to him from the standpoint of the audience , it 's that moment			0
he even allows @entity23 to kill him			1
@entity23 has the gun and he points at me , and he says , ' you want this ? ' and i go , ' yeah			1
i think it 's fitting			0
you need to do it , go ahead			0
' and then he says , ' if you want this , then do it yourself			0
i 'm not going to do it for you			0
' at least there was some conclusion to their association			0
and it was because of that history and friendship , that was the basis of his impulsivity			0
because otherwise it would just be , ' @entity232 , look at that guy , that poor bastard , ' but i 'm not going to risk my life for some stranger			0
there is more than familiarity			0
it 's deep - rooted			0
and it 's so true			0
because sometimes you do n't know the depth of what you feel until you 're tested			0
that 's why i think it 's a satisfying ending			1
it 's still true to @entity21			1
because he always possessed that			0
but it 's not saccharine sweet			0
it 's not done out of ' ohhh , @entity23			1
' it 's just ... ' @entity232			0
' if anything , it makes me hate @entity49 even more for his brutality			0
" did @entity22 feel that the meth lord - in - chief ultimately had to die to give many @entity3 fans the closure they were seeking ? " because of his love for his family , there was a thought of mine that , ' would it be a more perfect hell for him to have to see his family die -- his wife , his son , baby daughter — and he lives ? ' " he says			1
" and there 's some merit to that too			0
but ultimately , i think this is the best ending			1
and i 'm so grateful for that			0
