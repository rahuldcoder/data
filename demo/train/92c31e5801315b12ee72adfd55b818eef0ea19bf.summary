they allegedly conspired to acquire plastic explosives ( @entity50 ) and build two bombs , affixing them to the bridge 's support columns to be remotely detonated on monday			1
@entity8 , @entity10 and a man referred to as @entity56 allegedly agreed to pay $ 900 for the devices , as well as separate riot gear , according to a criminal complaint filed tuesday in @entity60			2
at first , they 'd considered using smoke grenades to distract local law enforcement in an effort to " topple financial institution signs atop high rise buildings , " the complaint says			1

" we can make smoke bombs , we can make plastic explosives			2
... it teaches you how to pick locks			2
it does everything , " he is alleged to have said			0
according to the complaint , authorities were first alerted to the beginnings of the alleged scheme last year when an undercover @entity21 employee attended a protest group 's event			1
the employee was deployed , the complaint said , because of " an initial report of potential criminal activity and threats involving anarchists who would be attending			2
" during the event on october 21 , 2011 , an undercover @entity21 employee observed " four suspicious males with walkie - talkie radios around their necks , " the complaint says			1
some of the men also donned black masks while carrying anarchist flags and " acted differently than the other people in attendance			0
" the men were " constantly moving through the crowd expressing displeasure at the crowd 's unwillingness to act violently , " it says			0
" during a briefing between protesters and organizers , the organizers explained who would be arrested , emphasizing that they wanted everyone to conduct peaceful civil disobedience , " the complaint adds			0
" one of the original four men turned away and said ' f --- that ' before the group of men walked away			0
" during the course of the alleged plot , however , @entity10 later expressed reservations , saying that blowing up a bridge " would not stop money flowing to the ' one percent , ' " the complaint says			0

" the @entity21 and the @entity153 are not and do not investigate movements , " @entity41 told reporters tuesday			2
" @entity0 national security contributor @entity156 said she would expect no others to be named in the case			0
" typically in the course of an investigation , you let that investigation run until you identify all those you believe pose a threat and then you wrap them all up at the same time , " she said			0
