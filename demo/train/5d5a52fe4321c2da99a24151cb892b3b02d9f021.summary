-- @entity1 , @entity2 -- a city with a long history of racial strife -- has been shaken by the release this week of a video recording showing a group of white police officers hitting an @entity10 man accused of attempting to steal a car			1
@entity12 , 29 , was arrested outside a nightclub in downtown @entity1 shortly after 1 a.m. on march 20			1
video of the arrest shows @entity12 , his hands raised in the air , briefly staggering down a sidewalk before being tackled and struck multiple times in the back of the head			1
a photo published by the @entity23 shows @entity12 with a bandage over a swollen eye after his arrest			1
two officers have been placed on paid administrative leave pending the result of an internal investigation , according to @entity31 , an attorney for the local @entity32			2
calls to the @entity1 's police department were not immediately returned friday			1
@entity12 has been charged with unlawful breaking and entering of a vehicle and receiving stolen property			1
but it is the allegation of police brutality that is drawing attention			0
" a group of white policemen and my client is a black victim			1
do the math , " said @entity46 , @entity12 's attorney			1
" it 's very sad that this is being cast as a racial matter , " @entity31 replied			2
" the police department is color - blind			0
this is not a racial matter			2
" @entity46 said the video , which he released to the media , came from the nightclub 's security camera			0
@entity12 works at the club and obtained the video			1
@entity1 mayor @entity60 -- himself an @entity10 -- is withholding judgment until the results of an internal investigation			1
" the mayor is very disturbed at the video and the images , " said @entity65 , @entity60 's chief of staff			0
but " there is due process and we will wait to find out the facts			0
" @entity65 told @entity0 the city had been examining the possibility of increased mandatory training on issues related to law enforcement and race before @entity12 's arrest			1
the city has also been reaching out to local faith - based and other civic leaders to encourage closer ties			2
" this heightens what we 're trying to do , " he said			0
@entity31 called the mayor " reasonable " and said the police welcome the idea of increased training			0
but @entity60 " does not have a law enforcement background , " she noted			0
the video showing @entity12 being hit does n't tell the whole story , @entity31 said			1
she noted that the officers were initially forced to chase @entity12 -- who has prior felony convictions -- and that in dealing with a suspect , holding the hands in the air can sometimes be interpreted as an act of defiance			1
most people " see the gentleman with his hands in the air and they think he 's giving up , " she said			0
but defendants are told to drop to the ground , and " if you resist , there will be action taken by the police			0
" " they used only the force necessary to ( ensure ) an arrest , " she asserted			2
@entity46 dismissed @entity31 's claim			0
" we have a defense to this , and they know we do , " he said			0
the video is " clear evidence there are some bad apples in the police department			0
" @entity46 said @entity12 intends to file a lawsuit against the police department			1
@entity12 's first court hearing on the car theft charge is scheduled for april 11			1
the mayor 's office declined to discuss the possible broader racial ramifications of the case			2
@entity1 , @entity2 's largest city , was the center of the civil rights movement that reverberated through the @entity136 and beyond in the 1950s and 1960s			1
the rev. @entity137 was arrested in the city for taking part in a peaceful demonstration , and penned the now - famous " @entity141 , " an open letter in which he spelled out his justifications for civil disobedience : " ... one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws			1
" the city also suffered the scars of racially motivated bombings during those turbulent years , most notably a blast at the @entity152 that killed four black girls in 1963			2
the @entity154 , which outlawed racial segregation , was signed by president @entity156 the following year			0
still , @entity1 has worked hard to rebuild its infrastructure and its image			2
in recent years , it has adopted " the @entity160 " moniker , " recognizing the city 's undeniable civil rights heritage while promoting its diversified destinations " as the @entity164 once put it			0
@entity60 , the mayor , plans to be in @entity166 on monday as one of the recipients of an award from the @entity170			0
the " @entity172 " award -- an allusion to @entity137 's historic " @entity175 " speech -- is given to those who work toward improving equality and justice			0
in @entity1 , " we embrace our past , but we only use it to build our future , " @entity65 said			2
@entity0 's @entity182 contributed to this report .			0
