@entity0 -- women have been some of @entity4 's harshest critics , but the thousands who gathered over the weekend in @entity0 at @entity6 , the largest conference in the world for women bloggers , fully embraced the " @entity11 " author , crowding around her for a handshake and a personal photo and giving her a standing ovation after her keynote appearance			1
@entity4 's repeated message to the women here was that " @entity11 , " her best - seller that has now sold 1 million copies , was n't just about encouraging women to become a ceo or run for office			1
" ' lean in ' is about believing in ourselves and reaching for any ambition , " the @entity25 chief operating officer and mom of two said , adding the book was directed at all women , from the work - at - home mom fighting for a better teacher for her children to a woman reaching for the c - suite			1
" it 's about each one of us asking ourselves what we would do if we were n't afraid and then reaching for those ambitions			2
" in light of criticism her message is elitist or critical of women who do n't have sky - high aspirations , @entity4 seemed to take pains to clarify what leaning in means for women such as the many work - from - home mom bloggers at this conference			1
were these remarks a shift in her message , i wondered as i listened , a recalibration after her book set off a national debate about what it means to " @entity11 " or a message that @entity4 had always wanted to send from the start ? " it 's not a recalibration , but if the message got lost , i have to take some responsibility , " @entity4 told me with a chuckle during a press conference			1
she said that while she considered writing a more detailed book , which she seemed to indicate would have included the stories of women from all walks of life , to make it " really authentic , " she focused mainly on her experiences and those of the people around her , who happen to be corporate women			1
" the intention was for the message to be really inclusive so that message is important to me , " she said			2
judging by the response from women i chatted with after @entity4 spoke , her message came through loud and clear this time			1
" i had always taken ' lean in ' as go all the way to the top , " said @entity83 , a mom of two who blogs at @entity85			0
" well , what if i do n't want to go all the way to the top right now ? " but after hearing @entity4 speak , @entity83 concluded that leaning in means simply " following your dreams , " whether they lead you to the boardroom or not			1
" what i took away from this is you should be the best at whatever you want to be , " said @entity96 , co-creator of an illustrated humor blog about parenting , " i do n't want to be the ceo of a @entity103 company			0
i would hate that , but i can be the best ceo or chief of scientific snarkiness of @entity107			0
" another point that resonated with the women here was @entity4 's concern about how we 're raising our daughters , leading to what she calls a " leadership ambition gap " -- how by middle school , in survey after survey , more boys say they want to lead someday versus girls			1
" and no wonder because little girls figure out really easily that the boys are going to lead and be liked and they are going to be told , ' do not be bossy , ' " she said			0
@entity123 , who writes about the comical side to parenting , did n't realize until she listened to @entity126 how differently she 's raising her son and daughter			0
" i am guilty of saying that she 's bossy , " she said			0
" i encourage her to be a leader on the field , but i do n't encourage her to be a leader off the field , but i do the exact opposite with my son			0
" @entity4 's celebrity status following the release of her book has led to speculation she might be looking for her next act beyond @entity25 , maybe even considering a run for public office			1
" no , i 'm doing about all the leaning i can do right now , " she told @entity6 co-founder @entity144 with a laugh			2
@entity25 , she made clear , remains her focus , but she 'll also spend as much time as she can on her " @entity11 " online community , which now has more than 250,000 members , making it one of the fastest - growing communities on @entity25 and the most engaged , according to @entity152 , president of @entity4 's nonprofit , @entity153			1
to demonstrate the power of that community , after her keynote , @entity4 joined dozens of women at @entity6 as they broke into small groups to conduct " @entity11 " circles designed to allow women to open up to their peers about questions such as what 's holding them back			1
" there were tables that cried , they cheered , they clapped , and at the end , they talked about ... how they felt , and it was amazing			0
' we can do anything , ' ' i feel empowered			0
' that is why circles are growing so rapidly , " said @entity174 , noting how there are more than 7,000 registered circles in all 50 states and at least 50 countries			0
during @entity4 's time at @entity6 , i was struck by the disconnect between the criticism she 's received nationally -- especially from some women -- and the response she received here from women , many of whom are not working in corporate @entity191			1
" i thought she was really humble and approachable , and i was n't really expecting that , " said @entity193 , host of the blog @entity195 , who had a chance to meet @entity4			2
@entity197 , a mom of an 18 - month - old who blogs at @entity199 , said she thinks much of the criticism stems from women trying to defend their choices			2
" i think it 's because people are looking at their own situations and clinging to their own sort of insecurities and not really being open to her message			2
" @entity210 , co-founder of the blog @entity107 , said she does n't find any of the criticism surprising			0
" people love to stir it up			0
it 's so much easier to have a big fat negative opinion than to get behind a movement that is trying to support a huge group of people			0
" follow @entity218 on @entity219 and like @entity220 on @entity25 .			0

@entity4 : " @entity11 " is about women facing their fears and following their dreams
some criticized @entity4 's best - seller as being elitist or *geared* toward corporate women
if her message got lost , @entity4 says she needs to take responsibility
women at @entity6 , the largest conference of women bloggers , liked what they heard
