@entity0 -- sen. @entity2 , welcome to the club			2
the two - term @entity5 lawmaker is now the seventh @entity4 senator up for re-election next year to face a primary challenge from his right			1
that club also includes the top @entity4 in the chamber , minority leader @entity12 of @entity13 , @entity14 of @entity15 , @entity16 of @entity17 , @entity18 of @entity19 , @entity20 of @entity21 , and @entity22 of @entity23			2
if this seems like deja vu all over again , it is			0
since the birth of the tea party movement in 2009 , primary challenges from the right have made major headlines , and have hurt the @entity4 's efforts in the last two elections in their attempts win back control of the @entity36 from the @entity37			1
" republicans effectively gave away five @entity36 seats the last two cycles because of candidates who were n't capable of winning in november , " said @entity38 , who served as communications director for the @entity40 , which provides support , advice and funding to @entity4 candidates , during the 2010 and 2012 cycles			1
dems defending 21 seats with @entity37 holding a 55 - 45 majority in the @entity36 but defending 21 of the 35 @entity36 seats up for grabs in the 2014 midterms , the @entity4 has another opportunity to try and retake the chamber			1
but @entity55 said that he does n't see a repeat of what occurred in recent years even though a majority of @entity4 senators running for re-election are facing primary challenges			1
" with the exception of perhaps @entity65 , it 's difficult to see that repeat itself even with the large number of primaries because many are not serious at this point			0
but @entity4 have a tremendous opportunity to win back control of the @entity36 next year and it 's a critical reminder to @entity4 primary voters that candidate quality matters , " he told @entity1			1
a top @entity36 @entity37 official disagrees			0
" republicans said they needed to rebrand and start reaching out to voters in the middle in order to win			0
they were right , but the primaries have prevented them from doing that			0
instead , primaries are forcing all @entity4 candidates to embrace the tea party and a slate of policy positions that will hurt them in a general election , " said @entity86 , deputy executive director of the rival @entity87			1
six - term sen. @entity16 will run again in 2014 while the jury 's out on what will happen next november , the new round of primary challenges from candidates enjoying support from tea party activists appears to be proof that the movement continues to strongly influence the @entity4 , even after some political pundits prematurely wrote the @entity90 's obituary after 2012			1
major player in primaries just as tea party backed lawmakers helped drive the unsuccessful push to defund the federal health care law , which helped to ignite the government shutdown in october , the group appears to once again be a major player when it comes to next year 's primaries			1
" the tea party gave voice to millions of @entity119 who understandably viewed @entity0 as an insular town determined to serve its own			2
as that old model breaks down , conservative influence in @entity0 will continue to grow , " said @entity122 , communications director for @entity123 , which supports conservative causes and legislation but does not back individual candidates in primary challenges			0
@entity2 faces challenge he tried hard to avoid he becomes first @entity4 senator to be challenged in a primary by a sitting member of @entity135			1
@entity4 tries to deal with damage done with women in this case , it 's rep. @entity139 , a conservative firebrand who served one term in the 1990s before winning a ticket back to the @entity142 in last year 's election			0
since returning to @entity144 , @entity139 's grabbed headlines for his calls to impeach president @entity147			0
@entity90 activists have been angry with @entity2 since earlier this fall , when he did n't support fellow @entity5 sen. @entity149 when he led the push to defund @entity151 with a marathon filibuster on the @entity36 floor			1
@entity2 told reporters on tuesday that he 's not surprised about the challenge , but that @entity139 " was n't on my radar screen			2
" @entity13 governor : @entity159 's @entity151 criticism will hurt him while @entity139 could find support among the ever increasingly conservative @entity4 electorate in @entity5 with its march primary just a few months off , he faces long odds against @entity2 , who has some $ 7 million cash on hand , compared to just $ 32,000 in the bank for @entity139			1
large incumbent war chests @entity2 , like @entity159 , has built large war chests in order to beat back primary challenges			2
and both men have hired veterans of the tea party movement to run their re-election campaigns			1
" if you look at the two @entity4 incumbents who lost the last two cycles , arguably they did n't take their primaries seriously enough and were n't prepared			0
that 's not the case this cycle where no one is taking anything for granted , " @entity55 added			0
last year , @entity149 upset @entity5 lt. gov. @entity184 , who had establishment backing , to capture the @entity4 @entity36 nomination , before going on to win the @entity36 seat in the general election			2
@entity2 says he 's learned some lessons from that and other recent contests			0
" i think senator @entity149 was unique in many ways because of his talents and the quality of the race he ran and the timing			0
so , i think one race does not a trend set but obviously there are lessons to be learned from that and believe me i 've learned them , " @entity2 said			0
@entity1 congressional producer @entity203 contributed to this report			0
