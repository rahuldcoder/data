editor 's note : @entity2 , a @entity3 strategist who serves as a political contributor for @entity5 , was the @entity6 campaign manager in 1992 and political adviser to president @entity8			1
he is active in @entity3 politics and a party fundraiser			0
@entity2 says @entity12 's new bipartisan strategy could have served the country well in 2000			1
@entity14 ( @entity5 ) -- on thursday , @entity12 , the moral and intellectual leader and most influential person in the @entity17 in the @entity18 , wrote in the august op - ed pages of @entity20 , the acknowledged epicenter of right - wing thought , that president @entity23 should adopt a bipartisan solution to address the president 's economic stimulus plan -- or as @entity12 refers to it , " porkulus			1
" @entity12 proposes that because the @entity3 got roughly 54 percent of the votes to the @entity17 ' 46 percent , the stimulus package should be allocated along his definition of ideological lines , i.e. 54 percent towards infrastructure improvement and 46 percent toward tax breaks for @entity12 and his friends			1
he writes , " fifty - three percent of @entity18 voters voted for @entity23 ; 46 % voted for @entity36 , and 1 % voted for wackos			1
give that 1 % to president @entity23			1
let 's say the vote was 54 % to 46 %			0
" as a way to bring the country together and at the same time determine the most effective way to deal with recessions , under the @entity44 of 2009 : 54 % of the $ 900 billion -- $ 486 billion -- will be spent on infrastructure and pork as defined by mr. @entity23 and the @entity3 ; 46 % -- $ 414 billion -- will be directed toward tax cuts , as determined by me			1
" and he is serious			0
however much one may disagree with the current " daddy " of all @entity17 ( @entity51 to differ ? see rep. @entity52 , who apologized last week for doubting @entity12 ) , you have to admire @entity12 's principled stance and his well - known consistent ideology			1
why surely it seems like just yesterday that @entity56 won the national popular vote in 2000 ( and arguably won the popular vote in @entity59 too )			0
@entity12 must have called for the incoming @entity61 administration to allocate ideas based on the proportion of election returns			2
i 'm sure president @entity61 and the republicans in @entity67 graciously accepted their 49.5 percent share of everything			0
( note : we would be much better off right now had this actually happened			0
) with 50 percent of the federal government during president @entity61 's term , @entity3 might have reduced the deficit ( a truly @entity76 idea )			0
@entity77 might have been more heavily regulated and @entity79 's lobbyists might not have been running the @entity80			0
democrats might have invested money into infrastructure improvements so that bridges did n't collapse or entire cities flood			0
we would n't have spent $ 350 million per day in @entity86			2
@entity87 , had @entity3 been able to control 50 percent of the government from 2000 to 2004 , we would n't have even gone into @entity86 in the first place			1
there might have been more spending on education and a fully funded @entity93			0
it is a remarkable time in @entity18 politics when a respected ideologue like @entity12 can take to a hyperpartisan place like the pages of @entity20 , and deliver such a consistent message			2
we @entity3 should congratulate @entity12 on the purity , intellectual integrity , and consistency of his positions			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity12 is now an *advocate* of bipartisan government
@entity12 proposes splitting stimulus plan between @entity23 and @entity17 , @entity2 says
@entity2 : if that plan had been in effect in 2000 , @entity86 war might have been *avoided*
