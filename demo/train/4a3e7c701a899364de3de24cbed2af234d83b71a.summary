-- as politicians and barge companies express fear of a shutdown or significant disruption , the @entity1 is tackling one of two significant problems presented in the drought - stricken @entity9			1
@entity10 , aware that barge traffic could be disrupted as early as next week because of sharply lower water levels , ca n't do anything about ice forming in northern portions of the river , impeding adequate water flow			1
but it is using contractors to remove rock formations in the river near @entity22 , @entity23 , to help maintain a 9 - foot - deep channel for navigation , said @entity27 spokesman @entity26			1
blasting , one of the removal measures , began december 21			2
the removal of 890 cubic yards of limestone will continue until the end of january , @entity26 told @entity0 on thursday			0
dredging has been ongoing since early july			0
a historic drought and excessive heat reduced water levels and scorched wide sections of the @entity38			2
flooding last year may have worsened the situation on the @entity9 by leaving deposits of silt and debris in areas that would normally be clear			1
two trade groups expressed concern thursday that the portion of the river near @entity22 -- about 125 miles south of @entity27 -- may be impassable for many vessels around january 3 or 4			0
they urged the administration to release water from @entity53 reservoirs			2
" this potential supply - chain disruption could amount to a staggering loss for the @entity60 economy , affecting nearly 20,000 jobs , " said the statement from the @entity55 and the @entity56 sen. @entity63 , @entity64 , and @entity65 colleagues from the @entity38 and @entity66 late last month called on president @entity67 to ensure commercial navigation of the river			2
the letter mentioned the need for sufficient water flow into the @entity9 from the @entity53			1
" significant curtailment of navigation ... will threaten manufacturing industries and power generation , and risk thousands of related jobs in the @entity38 , " the letter read			0
it cited in particular the stretch of the river between @entity27 and @entity83 , @entity23			0
corps officials recently met with @entity23 leaders to discuss its operations , among them the release of additional water from @entity90 , 50 miles east of @entity27 in south - central @entity23			0
@entity91 , an hydrologist with the @entity92 in @entity27 , said bitterly cold air expected in @entity94 and @entity95 was expected to freeze much of the flow from the @entity9 late this week			1
" however , that may not have much impact on levels this far south unless the ice makes significant progress southward , roughly past @entity95 , " @entity91 said on friday .			0

@entity9 faces possible traffic disruptions
ice *slows* water flow
*crews* blasting rocks that are threat to navigation
