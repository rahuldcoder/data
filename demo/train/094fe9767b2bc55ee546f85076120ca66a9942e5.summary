-- the recent controversy over arms sales to @entity3 reminds me of an interesting exchange during a hustings i took part in during the @entity9 campaign			2
we were in the @entity11 in @entity12 and , being a @entity13 , i felt very at home			0
a question came up about the arms trade and i fully expected to be ridiculed for being an absurd idealist			1
i said that some products should not be part of a market system and that arms were one of those			2
to my astonishment , all but one of the candidates agreed			0
the candidate who disagreed , a @entity28 , at least had the decency to look sheepish about defending this trade in the weapons of death			1
the prime ministers of the @entity34 and @entity35 have not demonstrated even this level of decency in recent days as they have sought to defend the sale of military equipment to @entity3			1
this first came to my attention in the @entity43 debate on @entity44 when a @entity35 member of our group challenged his compatriot for removing from our motion a call on the @entity35 government to ban the export of @entity54 helicopter carriers and end the training of 400 @entity3 sailors at @entity57			1
this questionable deal has become considerably more embarrassing since the shooting down of the @entity60 17			0
yet despite @entity35 foreign minister @entity61 ' earlier comments that if relations deteriorated he would ban the deal , the culture of shamelessness amongst arms traders and their political friends remains unchallenged and it is expected to proceed			1
the unseemly trading of accusations of hypocrisy across the @entity70 does nothing to build the confidence of the victims of the world 's conflicts that our countries are concerned for their plight			0
export licenses for @entity34 arms exports to @entity3 increased in the last 12 months at the very time that our prime minister and foreign secretary were mouthing meaningless platitudes about getting tough on @entity3 president @entity86			1
so , while money talks , the children suffering in the world 's conflicts zones are condemned to silence			0
which brings me to @entity94			0
by international consensus @entity95 is not a regime that is guilty of abusing human rights and so is an excellent market for arms exports : the @entity34 agreed licenses worth over Â £ 10 million just last year , according to the @entity102			1
in 2009 foreign secretary @entity103 admitted that @entity95 equipment being used in @entity94 probably contained @entity34 - supplied components and the same is almost certainly true of the current atrocities			2
during another debate in @entity108 last week , where our agenda was dominated by foreign policy i had to watch while the @entity113 motions calling for " a comprehensive @entity115 arms embargo to all parties in the region in order to prevent further violations of international humanitarian law and human rights " was expunged by the @entity121 demonstrating its commitment to business before morality			2
the @entity102 recently called for an end to what it labeled " arms control by embarrassment , " with governments waiting for catastrophes to occur rather than issuing ethically motivated bans on regimes with a history of abusing human rights			0
although it is @entity44 and @entity94 that are the current flash - points the main export markets for @entity34 arms are the wealthy oil states of the @entity139 including @entity140 , @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 , and @entity145 where citizens put their lives at risk for merely asserting their basic human rights , and their safety is threatened with arms made in the civilized countries of @entity153			1
since becoming an mep i have received many letters from lobbyists for different industries			0
the most disturbing by far was from a @entity35 arms company inviting me to the @entity159 , recently opened by @entity160			1
as well as their enthusiasm to demonstrate the effectiveness of their weaponry they also supplied me with statistics about their " economic contribution " in terms of annual turnover and healthy profits			0
i found this sickening because for every child that has died in @entity94 and each of the 80 children on flight @entity177 there was a weapon with a maker 's serial mark and a country of origin			0
even for those who would not join me in calling for an international ban on the sale of arms surely there is a need not to treat this as an industry like any other			1

@entity203 says @entity34 , @entity35 have not demonstrated decency as they *'ve* defended arms trade
she says a culture of shamelessness amongst arms traders and their political friends remains unchallenged
the @entity215 says that , even if *people* do *n't* want an arms ban , they should not treat industry like others
