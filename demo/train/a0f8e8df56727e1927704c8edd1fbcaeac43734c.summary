-- even before they had a chance to view it , everyone involved with @entity5 's megahit , " homeland , " " knew that it was something extraordinary and special , " said actor @entity8			1
the veteran star spoke to @entity0 at the premiere party for season two , ahead of the show 's premiere on sunday			1
in " homeland , " @entity15 intelligence officer @entity14 ( @entity16 ) believes that @entity18 sgt. @entity17 ( @entity19 ) , a pow returning from @entity20 , became a traitor while in captivity and is planning to fulfill a terror plot on @entity25 soil			1
at the end of season one , @entity17 decides to run for @entity28			1
meanwhile @entity14 , who suffers from bipolar disorder , realizes why @entity17 would turn on his country just as she 's about to undergo electroconvulsive therapy that will erase her short - term memory			2
season one received nine emmy nominations , and picked up four of them at the @entity36 , including outstanding drama series			1
' homeland , ' ' @entity39 ' win big at @entity40 if you 've been wanting to get into " homeland " or catch up before the new season premiere , there 's still time			1
season one was recently released on @entity45			1
in addition , @entity5 will air a marathon of all 12 episodes of the first season on saturday , september 29 , beginning at noon et / @entity50 two premieres sunday , september 30 , at 10 p.m. et / @entity50 to kick things off for sunday 's return , @entity5 and @entity54 hosted a screening and reception at the @entity57 in @entity58			1
among the attendees , who were greeted by an enormous @entity17 2012 fictional campaign poster , were the entire " homeland " cast , including outstanding actress and actor in a drama series @entity66 winners @entity68 and @entity19			1
' @entity40 for lead actors in a drama also in attendance were vogue editor - in - chief @entity72 and designer @entity74			2
cocktails were followed by a screening of the first episode of season two and an after - party on the @entity81 flight deck complete with fireworks , tiny cupcakes in the " homeland " logo and empanadas and pulled pork sliders served up directly under the @entity88			1
@entity8 shared with @entity0 how he prepared for the role of @entity91 , @entity15 @entity92 chief and mentor to @entity14			2
he traveled to @entity94 , @entity95 , and met with a man who had been a @entity15 chief			2
" i was asking a lot of emotional questions , " the actor said , " because i was interested in his emotional reaction to certain situations , fears -- human nature questions			1
" at one point , @entity8 continued , the former @entity15 chief mentioned that he had two daughters , " and the daughters came over and then we were there for hours talking as a family , and that 's when the nickel dropped for me			2
before we shot a single frame , i realized it was a show about family			2
it was a show about @entity91 's relationship with his ' daughter ' @entity14 , the @entity17 family , the family of the @entity15 and the family of the world at large			2
and so that moment when those daughters came to that table -- i was home free			2
" actor @entity122 plays @entity123 , @entity14 's boss at the @entity15			1
he recalled meeting a @entity15 agent in preparation for his role as director of the @entity128			2
" i happened to meet with a @entity15 operative who was a very scary lady , " he said , " a very beautiful lady , but a very scary lady			0
i had dinner with her and she kind of looked straight through me			0
i felt like she was looking into my soul			1
" @entity122 said he believes there has been such a massive positive response to " homeland " from audiences because it is " one of the few shows which really seeks to not only entertain but also tell the truth			1
it really hit a raw nerve with people			0
people really want to know what goes on behind the doors of the @entity15 in terms of terrorists and terrorism , and ' homeland ' kind of seems to answer some of those questions			1
" actress @entity152 plays @entity14 's sister and caretaker @entity154			1
" as season two opens , " said @entity152 , " it 's six months later , so @entity14 's had time to kind of go through some treatments and that 's where we jump off			1
she 's in good hands and we 're kind of helping her regroup			1
" " what 's nice about the way @entity165 , ' " @entity166 continued , " is they give us time before we shoot every scene			0
we sit down , we talk about it , we figure out what feels right , what does n't feel right			0
working with @entity8 is especially excellent ... we spent a lot of time on - set making sure that things were appropriate and accurate before we shot			0
it 's been such a thrill to go to work and to get to work with @entity16 and @entity8			0
" actress @entity178 said " season two tops season one , if that is possible			1
" ' homeland ' actress ' hair : the long and short of it of her character , @entity17 's wife @entity183 , @entity178 said that she loves that " she 's a no - frills kind of woman			1
she held her family together			0
she must have a sense of humor and strength somewhere deep inside that we do n't get to see very often			0
the strength you get to see , absolutely , but she 's vulnerable and going through a lot all the time , so you do n't get to see her laughing very much			0
but this is a woman who held it together for eight years alone , so i think she 's not a victim and she 's not afraid ; and when she is afraid she holds it together for her kids			0
" as for actor @entity203 , who plays @entity204 -- @entity17 's @entity18 buddy and the man who became @entity183 's love interest after she believed him dead -- he said that in season two , " i 'm always there as his friend , kind of like a safety net			1
i 'm always going to be there for the family			0
i think that inevitably i get pulled into certain situations			0
" actress @entity216 , who plays 16 - year - old @entity217 , said , " i love getting to be a hooligan and getting to be rebellious and openly so disdainful of my mother			1
" as for the upcoming season , of which eight out of 12 episodes have been filmed so far , @entity216 said there are " definitely some changes this year between @entity217 and her father			2
she kind of sees his faults a little more			0
" we also spoke with musician @entity229 , who wrote the " @entity165 " theme song and writes the background score			0
he received his 12th emmy nomination this year for " @entity233 " for " @entity217			0
" @entity229 was thrilled to be able to implement @entity14 's love of jazz into the storyline in creative yet subtle ways			0
" she 's a spontaneous , improvisational character , " said @entity229 , " impulsive			0
not many shows have jazz , so it was nice to have something new			0
" " homeland " is not a particularly heavily scored show			2
@entity229 said that if the audience notices the music too much , " then i 'm getting in the way			0
" but when it does contain music , @entity229 explained , " it 's extremely transparent and very much in your face			0
" for example , the pilot episode contains a scene that @entity229 wrote the music for , where a live jazz band is playing at a bar while news footage of @entity17 's return plays on tv screens			2
@entity14 studies the musicians ' finger movements on their instruments and concludes that @entity17 is tapping his fingers in some kind of code			0
@entity229 , who won three emmys for his work on @entity270 's " 24 , " noted that " @entity165 " die - hards will notice that the theme song has been varied ever so slightly for season two			2
" it does evolve , " he said			0
" it changes ; it gets a little darker at times			0
i 'm dying to speak of it but it has n't aired yet			0
" @entity279 , series co-creator and executive producer , recalled finding out that " homeland " was president @entity283 's favorite show			1
" we did n't feel that we had to do anything different , " @entity279 said , " but it gives us extra impetus every day in the story room to try to make this thing good the second season , to try to live up to the promise of the first season			1
" @entity279 said that the cast and crew remain stunned by the positive audience response to the program because " these wars that we 're fighting overseas are so removed from the general citizenry and their consciousness that we were curious whether anybody would even be interested in watching , but one thing that we felt was missing from television was this idea of the returning soldier and so we really wanted to dramatize how difficult that return can be sometimes			1
and obviously there are some serious extenuating circumstances in @entity17 's case but if you watch the first series of episodes you could interpret @entity17 's behavior as either somebody who 's hiding his terrorist motivations or somebody who 's just having trouble re-integrating back into his life			0

actress @entity178 : " season two tops season one , if that is possible "
actor @entity122 says " homeland " " seeks to not only entertain but also tell the truth "
co-creator @entity279 felt that the idea of the returning soldier was missing from tv
but he feared the wars we 're fighting were too " removed from the general citizenry "
