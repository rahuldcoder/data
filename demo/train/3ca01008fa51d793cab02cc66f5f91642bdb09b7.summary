-- we found out i was pregnant in august 2012			1
it was time to start our family , time to start the next chapter of our lives			1
the next months were going to be the best time in our lives			1
i had an uneventful pregnancy			1
we went to all the regular prenatal checkups , including one with a 4 - d ultrasound			2
we found out we were having a boy , and decided we would name him after my father , who had died of a heart attack a week after we confirmed the pregnancy			2
we headed to the hospital and at 1:15 a.m. our beautiful boy arrived			2
everything was just perfect -- until it was n't			2
i could n't see his fingers , and i could n't make out his hand			2
what was this ? was he going to be ok ? nobody in the delivery room had an answer			2
the neonatal intensive care unit was called in and the doctor told us it was likely amniotic band syndrome			1
within minutes , my son and husband were taken by ambulance to a children 's hospital			1
i had waited so long for his arrival , and my boy had been whisked away			2
i wanted so badly to hold him			2
i was his mother , and i would fix this			2
the days after a birth are supposed to be filled with bliss			2
ours were filled with scouring the internet for any information we could find			0
i saw nothing to help parents			0
i saw nothing to help us			0
i had read all the baby books			1
i had all the tests			0
how could i have never heard of @entity52 ? according to the @entity54 , amniotic band syndrome is a condition where stringlike bands extend from the inner lining of the amnion , the sac that surrounds the baby in the womb			1
as the baby develops , its extremities may become entangled in these bands			1
blood flow is restricted , resulting in stunted growth or even amputation			1
" @entity52 is spontaneous and not genetically linked			1
it affects 1 in 5,000 to 1 in 10,000 live births , " says dr. @entity69 , surgical director of the @entity70 at @entity71			1
our son was born with the bands still attached to his hand			0
the thumb on his left hand was severed			0
his first and second fingers were the size of golf balls			0
a band had wrapped around his right leg above his ankle			1
thankfully , his leg and foot had formed normally , but the scar from the band was deep			1
multiple surgeons told us to amputate his two swollen fingers , but i knew that he used those fingers			0
he used them to put his pacifier back in and to rub his eyes			0
finally , dr. @entity97 , a pediatric orthopedic hand surgeon at @entity99 in @entity100 , told us that she could reconstruct our son 's fingers			1
yes , they would be small , but he would get use out of them			0
she showed us pictures of hands belonging to children just like my son			1
@entity111 had reconstructive surgery at just 9 weeks old , and will need surgery on his leg in the next few months to release the amniotic band above his ankle			1
he will need yet another on his thumb to lengthen it			0
he is 15 months old , and he uses his fingers to pick up food and to hold his sippy cup			0
he uses them just the way any other child would , only his are smaller			0
our son does n't know any different because this is how he was born			0
but we worry about him learning to tie his shoes			0
we worry about him starting school			0
we also worry about bullies			0
since our son 's diagnosis , we have found multiple places of support			1
there are @entity137 groups for parents of children with @entity52 there is also a wonderful and supportive group called @entity142 that celebrates children with limb differences			1
every day he puts my mind at ease			0
he has a strength that is unimaginable			0
there is no doubt he will be able to do anything his heart desires , and we will be there every step of the way to support our beautiful , perfect boy .			0
