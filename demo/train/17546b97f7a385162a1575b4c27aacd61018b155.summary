@entity0 , @entity1 -- a dimly lit sports bar reading " cowboy poetry " is not exactly where you 'd expect to find a candidate for @entity8			1
but this was a campaign event wednesday for @entity10 , a former @entity11 senator now running as an independent 18 years after he was voted out of office			1
he joined a meeting of the @entity14 , of which is he a member , to get his campaign messages across with couplets and free verse			1
" @entity24 of your friends " by the western poet @entity27 was one of the poems he chose to read , saying it reflects what he is trying to do -- bring civility back to a broken @entity8			1
among the apropos lines in @entity27 's poem , read by @entity10 : " a hug or a shake or whatever seems right			1
it 's a highpoint of giving , i 'll tell you tonight			0
all worldly riches and tributes of men ca n't hold a candle to the worth of a friend			0
" just in case it was a bit too subtle , @entity10 hit it home with an explanation			1
" in today 's @entity47 you can hardly have a friend because you 're categorized immediately			0
i 've said that i think our leaders should be able to visit together , more civility should be returned to @entity47 , @entity47 , " @entity10 told the crowd of a couple dozen people			1
he also read a poem called " homecoming queen , " written by @entity1 poet @entity56 , who was in attendance			2
" homecoming queen " is about a beautiful young girl whose life did n't turn out the way she had hoped , becoming an embittered 40 year - old a waitress : " @entity65 ' tables and cryin ' the blues			0
do n't judge her too harshly ' till you 've had the chance to walk a few miles in her shoes " it was another campaign message -- that the former @entity11 cares about the underdogs -- those who need a second chance , or a second look			2
it was an off - beat event befitting an unusual candidacy			0
@entity10 voted for @entity80 twice , yet he contributed to @entity82 's campaign			2
" i want to work with both sides , " @entity10 said in an interview following his poetry reading			1
suddenly what was supposed to be a slam - dunk for @entity11 candidate @entity88 is more competitive , thanks in part to an anemic campaign and a scandal from his time as governor			1
@entity10 's presence in the race has made it even more unpredictable , since he is a well - known figure , especially for older voters			2
strategists in both parties believe he pulls votes more from @entity88 than the @entity104 candidate , @entity103 -- but both sides are going after him			1
" i 'm bad to @entity11 and @entity104			1
that 's reflective of what is happening across the board in the @entity109			0
you ca n't be a friend with anybody else and admit to it , " @entity10 told @entity2			2
he supports @entity114 ( with some changes ) and opposes the standard @entity11 promise to eliminate the @entity117			2
on abortion , he insists he does not believe @entity119 should be overturned , despite what appeared to be contradictory statements on the issue			0
it 's no wonder he says he stopped being a @entity11 because it went too far to the right in this state			2
he says he donated $ 100,000 of his own savings to his campaign , took out another $ 100,000 loan and raised about the same			0
he only has one full time paid staffer , and two part timers and sends out his own press releases			0
before he was defeated , @entity10 served three @entity8 terms -- 18 years			1
this time around @entity10 is vowing to only stay one term so that he is beholden to no outside special interests			2
" today 's @entity109 senators spend about 52 % of their time raising money , either for themselves or their colleagues for the next election			0
i will not have a next election			0
this is my last campaign , win or lose , and if i were in the @entity8 it would be a glorious job because i would n't have to raise money , " @entity10 told us			1
he wo n't say which party he will caucus with if he does pull off a win -- thanks to advice from @entity152 's independent senator @entity151			0
" he said it 's a very appropriate thing for an independent not to say which side you 're caucusing with			0
that 's the approach he took , and the reason is then i would be running as just another @entity11 or @entity161 , " @entity10 said			1
since @entity10 was defeated in 1996 , he has spent a lot of time still in @entity47 -- another line of attack from opponents , especially @entity11			1
but he makes no apologies for that , but also insists he spends " half to three quarters " of his time in @entity1			0
he is quite realistic about his chances for re-election saying " its going to be tough			0
" but , he insists , it 's about the " journey " rather than the destination .			0

@entity10 is a former @entity11 now running as an independent @entity8 candidate .
@entity10 read poetry at a @entity14 meeting .
@entity10 stressed that he wants to work with both parties having ties to both @entity104 and @entity11 .
