-- one of the most - anticipated new shows of the fall season , " @entity3 , " is now also the highest - rated drama debut in almost four years			1
the @entity6 program 's tuesday premiere was watched by 11.9 million viewers , and earned a 4.6 rating in the target adult demographic			1
that sizable turnout is n't really surprising , given the feverish excitement that has surrounded the show since @entity6 announced its interest in a " @entity15 " pilot last summer			1
co-creator @entity16 , whose career has veered into blockbuster territory with the 2012 film " @entity20 , " took out time from leading the " @entity20 " sequel , " @entity22 , " to helm " @entity3 's " pilot episode			1
those who watch tv for a living have been more or less satisfied , but a few fans walked away from @entity6 's 8 p.m. hour disappointed			1
' @entity3 ' : can ' @entity20 ' magic make the jump to tv ? " @entity3 " is built around @entity31 's agent @entity30 , who was thought to have died in " @entity20			1
" his recovery is one of the storylines that were teased during the pilot , which sees him lead the @entity15 ( @entity15 ) team			2
the idea is that @entity3 is filled with highly skilled and talented agents whose job it is to look into the " strange and the unknown " happenings , such as the stuff that went down in " @entity20 ' " climactic @entity44			1
the @entity15 agents are tasked with " protecting the ordinary from the extraordinary " in this post- " @entity48 " world			2
it sounds like it could be the setup for yet another @entity51 movie , but @entity52 and his team , which includes @entity55 and @entity56 , have scaled down this superhero universe to fit onto the small screen			2
the result , at least judging from the pilot , is that " @entity3 " is , well -- " okay , " said @entity62 's @entity61 in a review			1
" @entity64 in that pleasingly distinctive @entity16 way , with a few intriguing ideas about life in a superhero world , but with a cheap look and mostly bland supporting characters			1
... all told , it 's a much more promising start to things than the first episode of ( @entity16 's ) ' @entity74			1
' " but in the aftermath of " ' @entity76 , ' @entity79 's @entity78 trilogy , and the interlocking @entity81 movies , ( which ) are so overwhelmingly immense and glitzy ... a show like this ca n't help but look and feel anemic , " said @entity86 's @entity85			1
" but hey , it 's tv			2
... the show embraces its relative smallness , building much of the action around knowing banter and the occasional close - quarters fistfight			2
" @entity94 's @entity93 called tuesday 's pilot a " very promising start , " adding that " anyone familiar with @entity16 's tv work will be happy to see some of his best traits on display : the sideways humor that surprises while staying true to plot and character ; the efforts to ground the fantasy in real - world emotion ; the belief that events in past episodes ( and movies ) must have repercussions in the present			1
" with " @entity115 touches evident throughout , " the show " looks ready to hew a solid middle path between ' @entity20 ' and ' @entity114 , ' " critiques the @entity113			2
" it will never have the scale and budget and cast of the former , and it 's awfully hard to envision it equaling the emotional intimacy of the latter			0
but if it can weave together the strengths of each -- the breadth and mythology and fan interest of the @entity81 on the one hand ; the storytelling and character - development possibilities of serial television on the other -- it could prove to be something truly special			0
" some of those 11.9 million viewers might not be as patient to see how " @entity3 " will grow			1
@entity0 commenters have been emphatically frustrated , calling the premiere boring and predictable			0
" i really like @entity16 's work			1
i could see ' @entity139 ' over and over again and the movie ' @entity140 ' is great , " said @entity138			0
will give it one more chance			0
if it is as bad next week , i am done			0
" commenter blue meanie thought the premiere " felt pedestrian and a bit phony			0
seen that and done that before ; nothing special or extraordinary , and nothing ' marvelous ' about it			0
... take one part ' @entity158 , ' one part ' @entity157 , ' one part ' heroes , ' mix it up and that 's what you got			0
... the @entity52 - loving geeks will love this and swallow it up , but it 's a pass for me			0
" maybe " meanie " is on to something			0
@entity170 encouraged other viewers to " hate all you want , but i really liked it			0
i thought it had some good @entity115 hallmarks , while keeping in line with the @entity51 mythology			0
maybe all the ' cool kids ' are gon na publicly diss this because it 's the thing to do , but i thought it was great			0
i will gladly fan squee over this show			2
