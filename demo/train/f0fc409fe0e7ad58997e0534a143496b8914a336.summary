@entity0 -- we hear of tremors that shake , rattle and roll , but really cause no damage			2
then there are the big quakes that hit offshore and cause a scare , but nothing more			2
so , will the " earthquake " of the fringe parties coming in first in @entity12 , the @entity13 , @entity14 and others be a tremor , or will there be damage ? that now depends on whether these parties can translate their momentum into seats in their national parties			1
in many countries the fringe parties already have seats			1
in @entity14 , @entity28 should not even be called a fringe party , though they do occupy a space in the @entity32 parliament on the far left			1
i 'm thinking more about @entity34			0
call them populist , call them fringe -- the @entity13 's other parties must respond			1
for the first time in more than a century , a third party in the @entity13 has come in front in a national election			1
@entity34 has already had the desired effect of changing the national debate in @entity13			0
both @entity44 and the ruling conservatives have for the past few years had to defend their policies on @entity32 and immigration			1
the @entity48 have had to move closer to @entity34 's anti-eu and strong anti-immigration stance			1
all this before a single ballot was cast			0
now , @entity34 will the largest number of meps from @entity13			0
but unlike many other fringe parties in @entity32 , @entity34 does not have one single seat in @entity56 , the national parliament			1
@entity56 is controlled by the three main parties , with a smattering of seats going to regional parties from the far reaches of the @entity13 , and just one to the @entity62			2
@entity34 would have to create a massive earthquake to pick up even one seat during next year 's general election			1
but if you believe all the buzz from the elections , @entity34 is about to form the next government			0
this reminds me of five years ago when the " @entity75 " in @entity32 was the screaming headline after the last @entity74 election			1
then most people forgot all about the @entity74 , only for it to rise up the agenda when parliamentary expenses are criticized			2
the difference this time is perhaps , that the parties have gained more seats			2
@entity12 's @entity85 has gone from 6 % to 25 % of the vote			2
@entity34 has gone from 16 % to 27 %			0
@entity89 ' @entity88 , in the @entity87 , appear to have lost votes , but not seats			0
they are predicted to retain their four seats			0
in @entity96 , the @entity95 remained steady with three seats , but has become the second biggest @entity96 party in the parliament			0
it should also be noted that the far , far right @entity13 party , the @entity101 , lost both of their meps and will have none in the new parliament			0
so , what about the left ? in @entity14 , @entity28 has gone from one seat to six			0
it has already polled well in national elections			0
its leader @entity111 had put himself up at the next president of the @entity113 , and , it must be said , has made himself a credible candidate to be a future prime minister of @entity14			0
now , it will be up to the centrist parties , in the @entity74 and in national parliaments to cobble together coalitions if they want to thwart the rise of fringe parties			1
but they can not ignore the reasons these other parties continue to gain in popularity ; austerity , unemployment , slow growth , immigration			2
you may or may not support these party 's views , but they are tapping into a growing resentment in @entity32			1
the new parliament will have more powers than its predecessors , but it remains to be seen if it also have a bigger voice			0
opinion : @entity12 shaken by @entity140 : protest parties shake up @entity32 elections read more : @entity14 turns left			1

@entity1 's @entity144 looks at the rise of fringe parties in the *crucial* @entity32 election
*mainstream* parties must now respond to the *success* of protest parties , he says
centrist parties need to act if they want to thwart the rise of fringe parties
