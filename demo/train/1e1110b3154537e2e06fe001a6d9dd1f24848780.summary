-- @entity2 legislators plan to keep trying to find consensus on a controversial proposal that would release at least 27,000 inmates from state prisons			1
@entity2 gov. @entity7 , right , and officials tour a prison last week in @entity10 after a riot there			1
the @entity12 on monday delayed a possible vote on the plan			1
lawmakers likely will take up the proposal wednesday or thursday , said @entity17 , a spokeswoman for assembly speaker @entity18			2
" when we arrive at a responsible plan that can earn the support of the majority of the @entity12 and make sense to the people of @entity2 , we will take that bill up on the @entity12 floor , " @entity18 , a @entity20 @entity19 , said in a statement			1
@entity18 said legislators continue to meet with each other and law enforcement authorities to try to craft a plan that increases public safety , improves the state corrections department and reduces costs			1
as part of the negotiations , a provision that would set up a 16 - member sentencing commission -- which would put new sentencing guidelines in place by 2012 -- was stripped from the bill , @entity17 said			1
but " it 's not as if we 're giving up on that notion , " she said			0
the sentencing commission is a priority for @entity18 , she said , but the speaker believes she will have more success if she introduces a separate bill to create it			2
a panel of three federal judges has ordered @entity2 to reduce its prison population by about 40,000 by mid-september			1
the judges acted on the grounds that overcrowded prisons violate inmates ' constitutional rights			2
the state @entity59 voted 21 - 19 friday to release several thousand inmates early			1
that vote came after @entity59 president @entity64 @entity63 , a @entity65 @entity19 , assured senators the public would be protected from the most violent offenders			1
" of course , we want to keep violent criminals off our streets and out of our communities , and this reform package is a necessary step to do that because it concentrates our incarceration efforts on the violent criminals and ensures that nonviolent offenders have more contact with parole officers , " @entity63 said friday			0
all 15 @entity82 voted against the bill , arguing that it undermines public safety			2
@entity85 control both houses of the @entity87			0
" @entity2 's prison system is in a state of crisis , " gov. @entity7 said last week while touring the @entity10 in @entity10			1
some 250 inmates were injured this month at the facility in a riot that officials said was ignited by racial tension			2
fifty - five inmates were taken to hospitals with serious injuries , including stab wounds and head trauma			0
@entity7 said the riot was " a terrible symptom of a much larger problem			0
... our prisons are overcrowded and endangering the staff and the inmates			0
" the governor noted he had signed a budget that mandates $ 1.2 billion in cuts to the state corrections system			0
" we must be measured and smart about how we go about and create those reductions , " said @entity7 , a @entity113			0
" we must find a way to cut costs and relieve overcrowding but without sacrificing public safety			0
" @entity63 said the bill under debate would save the financially strapped state some $ 524.5 million			2
coupled with budget revisions made in july , the savings would total the entire $ 1.2 billion , he said			0
republicans said the bill would lead to the release of about 27,000 prisoners , while @entity85 estimated it would reduce the prison population by 27,300 in the 2009 - 10 fiscal year and 37,000 during fiscal year 2010 - 11			1
but @entity63 said the measure also would reduce the ratio of parolees to parole officers to 45 - to - 1			0
currently , one parole officer is responsible for about 70 parolees , many of whom commit new crimes and return to custody ; the state has a 70 percent recidivism rate .			0
