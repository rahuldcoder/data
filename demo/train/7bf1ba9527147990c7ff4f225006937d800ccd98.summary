-- nuclear scientists in @entity2 recently dropped some antimatter			1
the world did n't blow up , but there were some tiny explosions			2
scientists are hoping the experiment will teach them more about how the universe developed after the @entity10			1
physicists with @entity13 research group are trying to figure out how antimatter interacts with gravity , and if it produces " antigravity , " says the group 's founder , @entity18			1
their experiment mirrors the way sir @entity22 came up with the law of gravity in the late 17th century			0
legend has it that an apple fell off a tree and hit the @entity29 nobleman on the head			0
@entity22 got to thinking how gravity made the apple speed up as it fell			0
he postulated that matter attracts matter via gravitational force , which is why an object like an apple would fall toward a larger object : the earth			0
so , if matter attracts matter , what happens when antimatter interacts with it ? will it produce antigravity ? and would then a ball of antimatter fall up ? gravity with a twist " that would be a revolution , " @entity18 says			1
" that would mean we do n't understand something fundamental about the universe			1
" and a big piece of the puzzle is indeed missing , he admits			0
though people live with the effects of gravity every day and @entity22 's law of gravity has been around for over 300 years , scientific understanding of gravity is lagging , he says			0
" the way planets and stars move , we understand that well			0
" but how matter attracts matter on a molecular level is still greatly a mystery , @entity18 says			0
the @entity13 hopes to raise the level of understanding			0
antimatter science vs. fiction antimatter may be the stuff of science fiction movies and novels , but it is hardly futuristic , according to @entity81 , the @entity81 in @entity82 , where @entity84 's group runs its experiments			1
scientists have known about antimatter for more than 80 years , after physicist @entity88 discovered positrons in the 1930s			1
@entity81 makes the antimatter for @entity13 's experiment using a particle accelerator , which speeds up subatomic particles to nearly the speed of light and crashes them into each other to produce new particles			1
in the world of @entity101 's " @entity100 " and @entity103 's " @entity102 , " antimatter can make the @entity104 explode or power a star ship			2
if a large chunk of antimatter were to touch a large chunk of matter , the explosion would indeed be enormous , but it 's unlikely to happen			2
antimatter has not existed naturally in the universe for a very long time			1
" not in the last 13.7 billion years , " @entity18 jokes			0
that 's basically as long as the known universe has existed			1
antimatter abounded but scientists have long theorized that a lot of antimatter was produced during the universe 's inception			1
it has since disappeared , and they would like to know why			0
if equal amounts of matter and antimatter existed initially , they should have annihilated each other , but they did n't			2
only matter is left behind			0
the kind of antimatter @entity81 makes for the experiment is antihydrogen , a mirror image of hydrogen , which is the smallest known atom			2
because it is composed of so few parts , it 's the easiest antimatter atom to make			2
@entity138 's subatomic particles have an electronic charge opposite from those of regular hydrogen			0
@entity18 's team uses the latest technology to catch the antihydrogen atoms , hold them without letting them touch matter , and then drop them			0
when the falling antimatter meets matter , the two " annihilate " each other , as scientists say , and give off energy in the process -- a kind of nano - explosion			1
the alpha scientists measure the energy bursts to find how fast the antihydrogen molecules fell after they dropped them			2
the result so , did the antimatter fall up ? scientists with the @entity161 could n't tell , according to study published in @entity162			1
but the fact that they now have the technology to let it free - fall is a big deal , @entity18 said			0
" that you can do this at all ... is a bit of a revolution			0
" it paves the way for scientists to get the answer in a relatively short time -- a few years instead of a few decades			2
if scientists can figure out how antimatter interacts with gravity , it would take them a step closer to understanding how the universe was formed during the @entity10 , when a lot of antimatter was still around , @entity18 says			1
many scientists believe that antimatter acts in the same or in a similar manner as matter when it comes to gravity			1
the @entity13 puts that stance to the test			0
" in a world in which physicists have only recently discovered that we can not account for most of the matter and energy in the universe , " the study says , it would be " presumptuous " to cling to the idea			1
" we know that there is something fundamental about the universe that we do n't understand , " @entity18 said			2
in essence , scientists do n't know why the universe exists at all			1
more space and science news from @entity0 @entity210 follow @ @entity211 on @entity212 .			0

scientists have long hypothesized that the @entity10 produced lots of antimatter
it no longer exists in nature , physicists say
it is produced on @entity223 in particle accelerators
physicists study it to learn more about the formation of the universe
