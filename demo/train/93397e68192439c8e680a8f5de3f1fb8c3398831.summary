-- piracy off the coast of @entity4 rose nearly 200 percent in 2008 compared to the year before , with bolder attacks over greater distances , an international piracy monitor said friday			1
the @entity8 military on patrol in the @entity10			1
@entity4 and the @entity10 were the worst areas for piracy in 2008 , according to the annual report from @entity15 's @entity14 ( @entity16 )			1
it said 42 vessels were hijacked there and 815 crew members taken hostage -- more than any place else in the world			2
the increased ability of pirates to sail farther out to sea , coupled with the inability of the @entity4 government to respond , led to what the report called an " unprecedented " rise in piracy in the area			1
the problems off the @entity4 coast contributed to a global rise in piracy , which was up 11 percent in 2008 from the year before , the report said			1
" the 2008 statistics surpass all figures recorded by the @entity16 since it began its worldwide reporting function in 1991 , " said @entity40 captain @entity39			1
worldwide in 2008 , a total of 49 vessels were hijacked and 889 crew members taken hostage , the report said			1
eleven crew members were killed and 21 others are missing and presumed dead			0
the pirates are targeting every kind of vessel and are better armed and prepared to assault and injure the crew , the report said			0
incidents involving guns nearly doubled from 72 in 2007 to 139 last year			0
pirate attacks last year included the hijacking of the largest ship ever taken by pirates , an oil supertanker called the @entity64			0
attackers seized the giant ship and its 23 - man crew in november and only released it last week after receiving a $ 3.5 million ransom payment			0
the carrier 's crew was released unharmed			0
last year 's uptick in hijackings off @entity73 has already spurred a number of international navies to patrol the @entity10			1
@entity39 said he hoped that more governments would authorize their naval forces to patrol the region			2
" international navies are the only ones capable of effective response against piracy in the region and can help to secure the safety and security of this major maritime trade route , " @entity39 said			1
@entity85 ranks second in world piracy with 40 reported incidents last year , including five hijackings and 39 crew members kidnapped			1
the main difference between the @entity73 and @entity93 pirate activities is that almost all the incidents in @entity85 are conducted within its territorial waters , whereas most of the incidents along the @entity97 of @entity73 and the @entity10 occur on the high seas , the report said			1
that means vessels in the @entity10 area have a much harder time staying away from pirate - infested waters			1
the motives for the attacks are also different			0
in @entity4 the motives are financial while in @entity85 they are at least partly political , the report said			2
under - reporting of piracy in @entity85 waters is also a problem for the @entity15 , the report said			2
while 2008 appeared to be a bad year for piracy , the report noted declines in other areas of the world , especially in @entity117			2
@entity39 said sustained anti-piracy efforts by @entity117 authorities have resulted in declines every year			0
more than 121 attacks were reported there in 2003 but only 28 were reported last year , most of which were opportunistic , low - level attacks , @entity39 said			0
only two attacks happened last year in the @entity127 , which lie between @entity117 and @entity128 , compared to seven the year before , the report said			0
farther south , the @entity130 saw a slight rise in incidents , going from three to six , the report said			0
" this welcome reduction has been the cumulative result of increased vigilance and patrolling by the littoral states and the continued precautionary measures on board ships , " the report said			0
" with the world economy in its present uncertain condition , there is a possibility of piracy increasing			2
navies and coast guards must continue therefore to maintain their efforts against pirates			0

@entity4 , @entity10 confirmed as worst area for piracy in 2008
42 of 49 hijackings in 2008 were in the region , says @entity14
@entity16 says international navies are the only ones capable of effective response
