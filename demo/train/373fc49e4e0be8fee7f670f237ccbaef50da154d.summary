the plant was connected to the country 's electric grid in september with a capacity of 60 megawatts			0

@entity8 said the centrifuges , which are used to enrich uranium , were shown to the deputy of @entity12 , director - general @entity36 , but he did not say when			2
it was not immediately clear whether an @entity12 representative had in fact been to @entity1 and seen the centrifuges			2
the new centrifuges will enable @entity1 to enrich uranium over the current purity level of 5 % , according to experts cited by the news agency			1
uranium enriched to between 3 % and 5 % is necessary to make fuel for reactors			2
uranium enriched to 93.5 % is considered weapons - grade			1

" @entity1 has denied such allegations , saying the @entity6 plant will be used only to generate electricity and operates under @entity12 supervision			2
@entity62 secretary of state @entity84 has said the concern is not the @entity6 plant , but other nuclear facilities like @entity88 , in the middle of the country ; a facility at @entity92 , south of @entity0 ; " and other places where we believe they are conducting their weapons program			0

@entity6 plant will reach full capacity of 1,000 megawatts by february 1 , @entity16 reports
@entity1 's nuclear chief *claims* the centrifuges have been shown to an @entity12 representative
@entity16 cites experts who say centrifuges will be able to enrich uranium beyond 5 % purity
