@entity0 -- top @entity3 officials harshly criticized @entity4 on friday for its continued support of @entity7 rebels in @entity8 following the downing of a @entity11 jetliner			1
president @entity12 said friday that @entity4 president @entity13 has the " most control " over the situation in eastern @entity8 as intelligence indicates that rebels most likely shot down @entity16 from an area they control with a surface - to - air missile			1
nearly 300 people were killed in thursday 's disaster , including one @entity3			0
@entity12 said the rebels ' sophisticated weaponry and training needed to shoot down aircraft " is coming from @entity4 " and said the @entity3 could ratchet up sanctions on @entity4 if it continues to support the rebels			1
but he stopped short of blaming @entity4 or @entity13 for the debacle in eastern @entity8			1
but senior @entity31 lawmakers , most outspoken on foreign affairs and often critical of @entity12 's foreign policy , did n't hold back			0
they were quick and direct in blaming @entity13 and called for additional , more stringent sanctions against @entity4			2
" i think he is responsible , " said sen. @entity35 , a member of the foreign affairs and homeland security committees			1
" i mean , it was n't @entity13 that pushed the button to launch the missile , but the whole scenario , including the buildup of @entity4 troops across the border ... i think that he gave them the material and wherewithal to do it -- or facilitated it			2
" those calls come after @entity31 have criticized @entity12 for months for not taking a harder line on @entity4 or meeting @entity8 demands for more military assistance as it battled rebels			1
but now @entity35 said he sees " no separation " between @entity13 and the @entity8 rebels , calling that movement " clearly orchestrated " by @entity57			1
and @entity3 ambassador to the @entity62 @entity61 said investigators ca n't rule out the possibility that @entity4 may have helped the separatists operate the complex missile system			1
@entity61 also emphasized the crucial role @entity4 has played in the conflict in @entity8 , as well as the role the country can play to bring peace to the region			2
" @entity4 can end this war			2
@entity4 must end this war , " she said			2
sen. @entity76 of @entity77 said he believes operating the missile system " would need backup from a nation - state like @entity4			0
" " that would mean that @entity4 armed forces are directly involved in this wrongful death of roughly 300 people , " @entity76 asserted			0
@entity4 officials rebutted even the suggestion of @entity4 involvement and instead blamed @entity8 for creating a volatile environment in eastern @entity8			1
and while there are conflicting reports over whether the plane 's flight data and cockpit voice recorders have been taken to @entity4 , @entity4 foreign minister @entity89 said @entity57 would " insist on the most objective , most open and independent investigation " into the incident			0
still , @entity76 called for the @entity98 to file a wrongful death lawsuit " against @entity4 assets in the @entity3 " and said the @entity3 should target those assets to show @entity57 that " tens of millions of dollars will be lost			0
" rep. @entity102 , a member of the @entity103 , drew similar conclusions			2
he called @entity13 " largely responsible " for the downing of the passenger act , which @entity8 officials have labeled as a terrorist act			2
" if you 're a world power and you give this type of sophisticated weaponry to insurrectionists , you 're responsible for what happens after that , " @entity102 said			0
" this violates to me all norms of international behavior by a world power			0
" @entity3 officials have not yet concluded whether separatists obtained the missile system used to down the @entity123 airliner from @entity4 , though @entity12 confirmed that @entity4 has supplied heavy weaponry to the separatists			1
@entity102 said @entity4 's arming of the rebels with sophisticated weaponry amounted to " almost criminal negligence , " even though he does not believe @entity13 wanted the passenger plane to be downed			1
and though the tragedy came a day after additional @entity3 and @entity131 sanctions were leveled against @entity4 , @entity35 , @entity102 and other @entity31 lawmakers renewed calls for tougher sanctions			1
as retribution , @entity102 said the @entity3 should consider further action such as preventing the @entity4 airliner @entity139 from landing at @entity3 and other @entity141 airports			1
and @entity102 claimed such a ban would have a " devastating effect on the @entity4 economy			0
" @entity102 's comments came after @entity146 @entity31 rep. @entity31 called for a " stronger response " during an interview with @entity1 because " pinprick sanctions are n't going to get the job done			0
" @entity31 also called for direct military assistance to @entity8 , which he said is " fighting for its survival			0
" that 's a request the @entity157 government has voiced to officials in @entity0 , asking for armament and military advice			0
" i think that 's an unmistakable sign that we 're going to support them , that we 're going to try to give them the wherewithal to defend their territorial integrity			0
" even before @entity3 officials confirmed the plane was shot down by @entity7 separatists , sen. @entity170 , a @entity171 @entity31 , said @entity4 or separatist involvement would be a " game - changer			1
" @entity170 said that kind of information should trigger tougher sanctions from the @entity3 and more support from other countries			0
