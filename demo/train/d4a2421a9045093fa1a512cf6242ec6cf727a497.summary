@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 leaders assembled monday to mark the 10th anniversary of @entity1 president @entity7 's rise to power , a period described by state - run television as " a decade of successes			1
" @entity1 's @entity7 , center , is flanked by @entity11 's @entity10 , right , and @entity13 's @entity12			1
@entity7 and representatives of the leftist group @entity15 for the @entity16 , or @entity17 , walked through the @entity18 , a square on the edge of the old town of @entity0 that holds the sarcophagus of @entity22 , whom @entity7 credits with inspiring him as " the father of the revolution			1
" in 1819 , @entity22 founded @entity25 , a federation of what is now @entity1 , @entity25 , @entity28 and @entity29			2
in attendance were presidents @entity12 of @entity13 , @entity32 of @entity33 and @entity10 of @entity11 ; @entity34 , prime minister of @entity36 ; and @entity38 's first vice president , @entity37			0
absent was @entity7 's friend and mentor , former @entity38 president @entity42 , who has been sick			1
but that did n't stop @entity7 from addressing him			2
" @entity42 , from here i salute you , " he said			0
" revolutionary father , from here we , your sons and daughters , salute you ! " @entity7 and his allies founded @entity17 several years ago as a response to @entity53 influence in @entity4			1
@entity7 had a rocky relationship with former president @entity55 , whom he once called " the devil			1
" dressed in a dark suit and red tie , @entity7 stopped frequently to embrace and kiss children , some of whom chanted , " @entity7 ! @entity7 ! @entity7 ! " as he held @entity22 's jewel - encrusted sword in his white - gloved hand , @entity7 reaffirmed his commitment to the leftist path that has guided him : " there is no other path to redemption for the human being than socialism , " he said			1
with the day declared a national holiday , hundreds of people jammed the square to survey the pageantry			0
the leaders were to discuss the world economic crisis			0
@entity1 has been hit particularly hard by the recent drop in oil prices : oil revenue accounts for about 90 percent of its export earnings , about half of federal budget revenue and some 30 percent of gross domestic product , according to the @entity85			2
@entity7 was elected president in 1998 , six years after a failed coup attempt to depose then - president @entity88			1
@entity7 was sworn in on february 2 , 1999			2
he was re-elected in a special election in july 2000 after a new constitution was adopted and again in 2006			0
the new constitution limits him to two consecutive six - year terms , but the @entity1 congress recently set a referendum for february 15 that would allow @entity7 to run for a third term in 2012			1
@entity1 narrowly rejected a similar measure in a december 2007 referendum			0
@entity7 has been campaigning hard in favor of the referendum , which he called for in november , a week after candidates he backed won a majority of seats in local elections seen as a test of his influence			0
@entity34 brushed aside the possibility that @entity7 might lose			0
" i want to say to you , my friends in @entity1 , that we will be back to celebrate the 20th , the 30th , the 40th and the 50th anniversary of president @entity7 in office , " he told @entity7 supporters who braved a steady downpour to hear him			1
" @entity7 forever ! " the opposition on monday denounced @entity7 's effort to amend the constitution to get rid of term limits and criticized the declaration of february 2 as a national holiday that resulted in most stores being shut			2
" even today , as we are in this news conference , the national guard is on the streets asking who has opened their stores in order to make enough to carry food to their house , demanding and ordering their closure because today is a holiday , because we have 10 years of bad governance , " said @entity123 , director of the opposition party @entity124			0
but @entity138 , @entity11 's first indigenous president , credited @entity7 with helping the country			2
" these revolutions do n't go backward , " he said			0
" we can make mistakes , i can make mistakes , but the people do n't make mistakes			0
