-- new @entity2 owner @entity1 insists that he will not interfere on the football side following his takeover of the @entity6 club			1
@entity2 chairman @entity7 , left , and new owner @entity1 at the club 's final game of the season			1
the @entity13 billionaire will buy out the controlling interest of the @entity15 headed by club chairman @entity7 , upping his stake from 30 % to 100 %			1
based in @entity17 , he has made the @entity19 club the fourth in the @entity6 to have @entity13 owners , alongside @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24			2
his move came hot on the heels of news on wednesday that @entity29 owner @entity28 had agreed to sell his club to @entity32 businessman dr @entity31 -- who was previously instrumental in the @entity34 's takeover of @entity35			1
@entity1 , who saw @entity2 avoid relegation on the final day of the season last weekend , told the club 's web site that he will be sticking to the financial side of the business and allowing former @entity2 striker @entity7 to deal with football operations			1
" @entity7 runs the club , " the 48 - year - old said			2
" @entity7 is a very smart footballer , very smart about the @entity6 and is a wonderful chairman of the club who knows more about football than i ever will , so i will be in the background and @entity7 will be running the show			1
" i will be involved in things like finance			0
with me coming in , you get all of these other good ingredients that are already in place at the club and can add to that a streamlined decision making process , a streamlined board and with some financial ability to make some moves -- and we think that is the missing piece that this club has needed			0
" @entity1 funded @entity2 's transfer business last summer , with former manager @entity67 spending large before surprisingly quitting in december after a poor run of results			1
his replacement @entity71 stood down last weekend after guiding the team to safety , and @entity2 have now been linked with a move for @entity76 boss @entity75			2
@entity1 said he was prepared to further invest money in new players for next season			2
" it 's a very big club with a lot of fans , a big stadium and a lot of revenue -- and when you are in a position where we are , trying to improve it , it takes money , " he said			0
" but if that money is invested wisely , and the personnel decisions that you make are good ones , then i 'm not worried at all			0
i fully expect that @entity7 will be able to make good personnel decisions going forward			0
" @entity2 announced on thursday that veteran @entity97 was one of seven players to be released ahead of next season			1
the 37 - year - old @entity100 international , who is out of contract , will depart the @entity103 along with striker @entity104 , midfielder @entity105 , goalkeepers @entity106 and @entity108 and young defenders @entity109 and @entity111			0
meanwhile , prospective @entity29 owner @entity31 has told fans he intends to build a " great football club " once his takeover is completed			1
@entity29 have accepted an offer from the @entity117 property magnate , and a period of due diligence will take place in the next few weeks			0
" everything i have seen makes me sure that we can build a great football club in the years to come , " he told arabianbusiness.com			0
" @entity29 has incredible history , and its fans are some of the most loyal in the world of football			2
i look forward not just to working with them , but listening to their views on how they want to take the club forward			0
" i am the investor , but this is their club and their community -- and it is a privilege to be taking charge			0
