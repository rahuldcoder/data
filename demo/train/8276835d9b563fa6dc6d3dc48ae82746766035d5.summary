-- to say that i am upset by the copycat violent protests spreading around the @entity4 and @entity5 world would be an understatement			1
i want to protest against the protesters			0
the mindless and criminal actions of a few in @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and elsewhere , which have already led to the deaths of innocents , threaten to do a great deal of harm and seem never to make a sensible point			0
like many other @entity5 , i suspect , i have wrestled with the most appropriate response to that 14 - minute trailer of trash produced by extremist , criminal -- yes , the " producer " apparently has a criminal record -- filmmakers in @entity26			1
i have come down on the side of sanity			0
opinion : in @entity13 , protests mask diverse views on @entity34 video for sure , as a @entity5 , i am offended by those who recklessly and purposely denigrate my faith and those who share my faith			1
certainly , some of the protesters represent the unemployed , the abused and the just plain forgotten in @entity4 and @entity42 states that have been ruled by autocrats enjoying the patronage of @entity46 governments			1
it is also an obvious point for anyone living in this part of the world that virulent anti-americanism is a driving force for what is happening today			0
@entity56 policy in the region has bequeathed a fatal breakdown in trust between successive @entity56 administrations and @entity4 and @entity5			1
an unjust and illegal @entity63 war , a " war on terror " that spawned a whole new drone industry , @entity66 's double standards in promoting human rights in the region and its unflagging support for @entity70 in spite of an expanding occupation in @entity73 have all contributed to that legacy			1
as @entity4 states undergo a historic transformation , this breakdown in trust is having a devastating effect as the @entity81 administration wrestles with the right thing to do			1
arabs , with the notable exception of most @entity10 , give the @entity56 very little credit for what it is doing and complain , as in @entity87 and @entity88 , about what it is not			1
but absolutely none of the above should justify the violent protests sweeping the globe			1
instead , the violence of the protests has undermined our legitimate pain in the eyes of billions across the globe			2
the protests have reinforced those who seek to portray @entity5 as wide - eyed extremists and @entity42 as an inherently intolerant , violent faith			1
news : free speech or incitement ? @entity109 magazine runs cartoons of @entity111 worse still , they have detracted the attention of the world from the continuing slaughter in @entity87			1
last month was reportedly the most violent on record in all the @entity118 's recent conflicts -- more so even than @entity63 at the height of its civil war			1
many @entity87 on social media and elsewhere are asking themselves , rightfully , where are the protesters when @entity87 president @entity124 and his regime continue to kill more than 150 men , women and children a day ? and when his supporters continue to chant " there is no @entity131 but @entity124 " ? if we are not careful , these protests could encourage the world to forget the so - called @entity135 and turn away from the struggle for dignity , justice and opportunity that has driven people to demand change			1
surely , that is the hope of their biggest supporters -- a mix of former regime elements , @entity148 offshoots , other jihadists and @entity151 political parties			2
it is no coincidence that the protests first took root in weakened states , such as @entity11 , @entity10 and @entity12 , which are in the early stages of democratic transitions			2
while not all the protesters may know it , their actions are helping those who want to derail those transitions			0
that is why new governments in these countries must show zero tolerance for the violent challenge posed by these protesters			2
as they must surely know , they are engaged in a battle for the soul of their societies			0
there must be no hesitation , no equivocation and no nuance in dealing with such violent aggression			2
in particular , president @entity181 of @entity11 , an @entity182 leader from the @entity184 party , has to demonstrate the clear moral leadership that is required to steer his country to calmer waters			0
for many , his response to date and that of the @entity184 has been troubling , illustrating both a lack of understanding of the @entity56 and a desire to appease the demonstrators			1
it has shown a lack of confidence			0
@entity181 must realize that he is the president of @entity11 , not simply a leader of the @entity184 's @entity199 -- from which he actually resigned on taking office just a few months ago			0
the economy and international reputation of his country is suffering great damage , which he must urgently reverse			0
although opinions about him are sharply divided , @entity181 has the legitimacy to rally his people			0
he has the responsibility to insist on safeguarding the rule of law , without restricting new democratic freedoms			0
news : why video upset so many @entity5 the protesters must realize that we can not continue to go through this kind of turmoil every time an ill - meaning hate - peddler decides to mock our faith			2
the idiocy and recklessness of the people behind " @entity222 " are without question			0
sadly , those who continue to protest violently against them are acting just as stupidly			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity228 .			2

@entity228 : violent protests of *anti-islam* film have killed people and are *pointless*
@entity228 thinks the film , @entity56 policy , @entity63 war have justifiably angered the @entity118
but protests *bolster* worst @entity5 *stereotypes* , he says , detract from issues like @entity87
@entity228 : *anti-democracy* elements behind protests ; @entity4 leaders must denounce them
