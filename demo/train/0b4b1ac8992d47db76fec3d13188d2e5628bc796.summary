@entity0 -- it was a crowning achievement , but he was n't sure that he wanted to be there			2
he was n't sure he could make it through the speech without running out of the @entity8 chamber in panic			2
and he did n't know how many of his country 's leaders cared			2
@entity12 wore his camouflage combat uniform , surrounded by lawmakers , innovators and a few celebrities , and he stepped into a room that would hold the world 's greatest concentration of power per square inch for an hour or so			1
but the everyday hero just wanted to get through the @entity23 on tuesday night			1
his seat was next to the door , just in case			2
the much - coveted invitation came because of his heroism on november 5 , 2009 , when he stopped by the @entity29 at the sprawling @entity31 base at @entity32 , @entity33			1
moments after military psychiatrist @entity34 opened fire , @entity12 threw himself on top of another soldier , likely saving that man 's life but taking five bullets himself			1
his wounds still affect him			2
his eyesight may deteriorate for the rest of his life			2
but as @entity12 looked out from the @entity8 chamber balcony tuesday night , the biggest potential issues were his mind and fears			1
" i do n't like being by myself , " he said earlier before the event , pausing			2
" i do n't trust , it 's hard for me to trust people now			2
" @entity12 was honored to be at the @entity52 , of course			1
but logistics dictated that the shy , blue - eyed veteran had to sit with strangers			1
( each member of @entity57 got one ticket			1
) and he did n't like that			2
@entity12 needs to be around people he knows			1
and after he survived the massacre in the middle of a @entity31 base , he has a hard time trusting security anywhere			1
the increased measures at the @entity52 actually added to those concerns , raising the idea that this place was especially threatened			2
but the unassuming man came anyway , battling his post-traumatic stress disorder - instincts out of gratitude to his hometown congressman , @entity74 @entity73 of @entity75 , and to push for what he believes is long overdue recognition for the victims of @entity32			1
" the @entity81 says it was workplace violence , " @entity12 relayed hours before the @entity23 , sitting on a window bench tucked into a @entity8 office building stairway			1
" it was a terrorist act ... to me , it seems they 're trying to cover it up , almost as if it never happened the way it did			1
" there are multiple issues here			0
under the " workplace violence " designation , benefits are lower than if the attack were considered terrorism or part of an active conflict			2
victims and families face lower disabled income or death benefits			0
thirteen people were killed at @entity32			1
a softer @entity74 side in response to @entity104 @entity12 spoke with determination on this			1
" it 's not about the money for me			0
it has nothing to do with the money , " he said			0
he wants the families to be recognized , for victims to be able to receive purple hearts for their wounds and be afforded all honors appropriate to that at a military burial			0
but @entity12 and his family believe the vast majority of @entity120 do n't know about their continued battle			1
and that @entity57 is happy to move on			1
" there is a bill , @entity124 3111 , to declare @entity32 a terrorist act , but @entity57 ... , " he shakes his head			1
" @entity127 at the @entity128 was a terrorist attack , but this , no. " @entity34 was convicted last august in a military court of murder and attempted murder			0
a jury recommended a death sentence			0
thirteen people were killed at @entity32			1
a @entity120 - born citizen of @entity137 descent who was preparing to deploy to @entity139 , @entity34 admitted to targeting soldiers			0
he said at one point that he wanted to protect the @entity142 and its leaders from the @entity120 military			0
comprehensive coverage : @entity23 investigations after the massacre found he had been communicating via e-mail with @entity150 , an @entity151 - @entity120 radical cleric killed by a @entity120 drone attack in 2011			1
@entity12 's foot taps as he talks about it , but otherwise his bearing was deeply calm			1
his injuries rewrote his life			0
he is no longer allowed to drive			0
and he lives with his mom , @entity160 , and stepdad , @entity162			0
the couple sometimes ca n't get the 34 - year - old to leave his room			0
" before ( coming to @entity0 ) , he spent three days in his bedroom , " @entity160 confided			0
" he was really nervous			0
" that bedroom is a safe place , he thinks			0
to help , @entity160 and @entity162 made the road trip with their son			0
they stood next to him during interviews			0
walked beside him down @entity177 's hard marble hallways			0
for @entity160 , the trip is a part of her son 's recovery and his mission now			0
" i think it 's time for some of his story to come out , " said @entity160 , who is as feisty and confident as her son is humble and careful			0
this is the first time @entity12 has ever heard a @entity23 address			1
but frankly the speech was not his main interest			0
he was at the @entity52 to represent people who served the military , suffered at the hands of a gunman and who now feel overlooked			0
when asked what he hopes for himself , the 13 - year veteran gave an answer of recovery			2
" i do n't know			0
right now , i 'm hoping for today , " he said			0
and , it turns out , the day was good			2
in the teeming @entity8 chamber , @entity12 saw the unexpected -- the face of fellow @entity32 survivor @entity204 , just a few seats away			1
@entity12 knew his friend was in town , but not where he 'd be during the speech			1
he did n't need to run			0
and he could listen as the president and @entity57 honored another surviving soldier -- sgt. @entity213			1
high up in the balcony , off camera , @entity12 soaked in the wave of cheers			1
" it was a pretty good night , " he said .			0

veteran @entity12 , a survivor of the @entity32 massacre , attends @entity23
he suffers from post traumatic stress disorder and *wonders* if @entity57 cares
@entity32 hero just wants to get through the day
@entity12 wants @entity32 to be identified as an act of terrorism
