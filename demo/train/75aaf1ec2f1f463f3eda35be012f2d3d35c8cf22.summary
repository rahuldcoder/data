-- @entity1 staked his claim to be the best pound - for - pound boxer on the planet after his brutal demolition of @entity6 in their @entity8 light - middleweight title bout in @entity9 , @entity10 late saturday			1
nicknamed @entity11 , @entity1 -- the only boxer in history to have won a world title at seven different weight divisions -- claimed his eighth belt in a new class after a unanimous decision over @entity6			1
@entity1 dominated from the outset , with his superior hand speed and power constantly troubling the @entity22 fighter who had boasted a significant height and reach advantage			2
but the champion 's ruthless barrage of punches inevitably began to take their toll on @entity6 's face as a nasty cut opened up below his right eye			1
at one point in the 11th round @entity1 appeared to look towards referee @entity35 as if he was trying to get him to call a halt to the fight			0
despite his domination @entity1 could not land the knock - out blow against what was thought to be his biggest opponent yet , even taking a few powerful blows himself in the middle rounds			2
" he is really strong , " @entity1 commented after the fight , in quotes carried by @entity45			0
" i never expected him to be as strong as he was			0
" but he admitted that the injuries sustained by @entity6 , who had completed a suspension after being caught with plaster - filled hand wraps in his gloves prior to a fight against @entity53 , caused him some concern			1
" i feel for my opponent , " @entity1 said , in quotes carried by @entity45			0
" his eyes ( were swollen and cut ) and bloody face			0
i wanted the ref to look at that			0
" the build up to the fight had been overshadowed by rumors that the @entity66 could soon retire			0
last month @entity1 's long - time coach @entity67 said the @entity66 was more preoccupied with his new role as a lawmaker and could not concentrate on his preparations for the november 13 bout			2
the pair eventually agreed to move their training camp to the @entity75 to focus on the fight			2
@entity1 had been lined up for an eagerly - awaited clash with @entity75 @entity77 earlier this year , but negotiations broke down amid a welter of recriminations and legal threats			1
a clash with @entity77 would likely be the richest in boxing history , but appears no closer to fruition .			1
