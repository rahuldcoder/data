@entity0 , @entity1 -- from the uncertainty that followed the breakup of the @entity5 , a newly invigorated @entity1 has emerged , displaying unprecedented political , military and economic confidence that has , at times , put it on a collision course with the @entity10			1
a resurgent @entity1 has been flexing its military , political and economic muscles			2
with no sign of strongman @entity13 taking a political backseat , @entity1 looks set to continue its bid to regain superpower status , providing that its citizens can endure the crippling impact of the global financial crisis and shrug off fears that their newfound freedoms , outlook and relative prosperity will be short - lived			1
here @entity2 @entity0 correspondent @entity24 explains what has driven @entity1 's re-emergence , how this has affected its role on the world stage , and what can be expected from the country in the future			1
q : what has been the driving factor behind @entity1 's resurgence ? a : @entity36 was behind @entity1 's resurgence , but there 's a real sense in which the global financial crisis has checked @entity1 's aspirations of a return to superpower status			1
before the downturn , the booming price of commodities , such as gas and oil , of which @entity1 is big supplier , fueled prosperity and gave @entity1 a confidence they had n't previously enjoyed			1
it also saw the @entity53 being taken much more seriously on the international stage , inserting itself into @entity56 peace talks , the @entity59 nuclear issue and a host of other issues			0
it has also encouraged @entity1 to assert its presence in what is known as the near - abroad -- the former @entity5 states			2
many of those states want to move towards @entity66 and @entity67 , but @entity1 wants to keep them within its sphere of influence			2
the obvious example of this is @entity1 's war last year with @entity71			1
after @entity71 announced its intentions to sign up to @entity66 , @entity1 launched a military offensive much to the dismay of the international community			2
q : is there a change of atmosphere in @entity1 these days ; are people more optimistic about the future than they were 10 or 15 years ago ? a : despite the financial crisis , people enjoy a lot more freedom and a lot more prosperity than they did 15 years ago , but there 's a deep - seated insecurity among @entity1 that it could all -- the money , the freedom -- come to an end			1
watching their currency collapse by 30 percent over the last year , unemployment soar 10 percent and industrial output plunge has made @entity1 very uncomfortable about the future			1
at the moment people do n't see an end to the hardship			0
at the same time , the @entity53 has spent a lot of its hard currency softening the blow of the crisis , bolstering pensions and the welfare system , and that 's been appreciated by many @entity1 too			1
q : is there much rose - tinted reminiscing about the past ? a : there is on lots of levels , certainly among @entity1 's pensioners , who gave their lives to the cause of communism , fought in @entity116 against @entity117 and perhaps enjoyed a privileged position in @entity5 society			1
there 's a great sense of loss about the collapse and nostalgia about what were seen as the good things : strength , order and global power			0
the younger @entity1 did n't have that experience of the @entity5			2
nevertheless , icons of that period such as former @entity5 leader @entity132 are still viewed with affection by many people in part because of what he represented : @entity1 as a world power			2
the idea that he oversaw brutal oppression is very much ignored			0
q : are there any changes in the way @entity1 sees the rest of the world ? a : yes , not least because in the @entity5 period people did n't get to travel overseas and foreigners always viewed @entity1 with suspicion			0
this has started to change noticeably			0
@entity1 are more visibly internationally			0
they go on holiday all over the world : @entity153 , @entity154 , the @entity155 , the @entity156			0
they are much more assimilated into the global village than they ever were during the @entity5 period			0
this has broadened people 's minds here and made them much more tolerant in their global outlook in general			0
q : will @entity13 remain key to @entity1 's future ? a : there is very little doubt in the mind of most @entity1 that @entity13 remains not only a central figure in the country 's decision making , but is perhaps the main decision maker			1
a recent opinion poll by an independent @entity175 showed that 24 percent of @entity1 consider @entity13 to have the real power , compared to just 12 percent for his hand - picked successor , president @entity177			1
as for the future , in the past year since @entity177 was sworn in , there is very little sign he has stamped his mark			0
it still looks to domestic and international audiences that @entity13 is calling the shots			0
at this point it 's hard to see any evidence that the situation is going to change .			0

booming oil and gas prices have fueled @entity1 's recent prosperity
heavy impact of financial crisis has weighed heavily on superpower aspirations
no signs of @entity13 taking a backseat role in @entity1 's future
