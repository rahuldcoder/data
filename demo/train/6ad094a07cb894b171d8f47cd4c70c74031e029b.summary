-- for a film about travel , " @entity4 " almost makes you never want to travel again			1
the 80 - minute documentary by @entity7 - based anthropologist @entity6 takes the pants off the tourism industry to expose the negative impact travelers have on the places they pass through			1
@entity13 filmed in numerous locations along the " gringo trail , " a series of hot spots around the world first explored by adventurous @entity20 backpackers seeking the undiscovered and authentic -- the so - called " hidden gem " destinations			1
inevitably , word gets out about these once little known places , and more backpackers descend			0
close behind comes the whole gamut of the hospitality industry -- the hotels , booze , drugs and sex peddlers , multi-national tour operators , and the sirens of independent travel , guidebooks			2
within a decade , places like @entity38 beach in @entity39 go from untouched haven to full - blown party destination visited by tens of thousands of hedonists			1
uncontrolled development overwhelms the environment and crushes local culture			0
window seat -- but you may not like the view for those who love to travel , " @entity4 " is a bucket of ice water in the face			1
it forces us to confront the consequences of tourism and how travelers have a long - term effect on the places that they visit			0
why am i traveling ? why do i want to go where i 'm going ? where are my tourist dollars heading and what else am i giving to a place ? these are the questions " @entity4 " asks and , as importantly , wants us to ask of ourselves			1
as such , it 's a neat little @entity67 101			0
a moving essay with a broad scope , it takes us on an intrepid guilt trip around the world , from @entity38 to @entity73 to @entity75 's @entity74 to @entity76			1
for those who have read up on the problems of introducing tourism to developing countries , " @entity4 " wo n't offer anything new , but it brings vague notions to life through dramatic images , sometimes beautiful , most times appalling			1
hodgepodge technique distracting " @entity4 " is inconsistent in style and quality			1
some shots are slick and well - produced -- an opening sequence featuring a continuous aerial shot over the @entity75 jungle sets up a glamorous big - budget feel			2
other scenes have a low - def , hand - held quality , which adds immediacy but can be annoying			0
@entity13 began filming in 1999 , picking up new filmmaking skills ( and likely more budget ) along the way			0
adding to the confusion are humorous anecdotes that pepper the film			0
standing in front of large maps , travel professionals speak directly to the camera in aggressively chirpy tones , like friends recounting travel stories to each other at the bar			2
it 's a jocular , reality - tv style that clashes with the heavy subject matter and creates emotional speed bumps in an otherwise somber film hurtling toward ever more bleak examples of irresponsible tourism			0
one of the primary narratives is set in @entity75 , where the tale of @entity123 , a backpacker who got lost in the @entity75 jungle in 1981 and survived for weeks before being rescued , has attracted a tribe of thrill seeking travelers			1
@entity123 eventually returned to @entity75 to help set up the @entity128 , a project now owned and operated by the @entity75 that helped to rescue him			2
the film concludes with a vignette about the @entity128 project			0
it 's an optimistic note -- a traveler who harnesses the power he has over a destination and its people -- that serves as a great argument for responsible travel			2
there may be no singular , fool - proof formula for how a nation should develop its tourism industry , but @entity13 's film should get us talking about the many possibilities			0
" @entity4 " was released through @entity147 and is now showing on the global film festival circuit			2
upcoming screenings : @entity150 , in @entity151 , march 19 ; @entity152 , in @entity153 , march 29 @entity154 is a travel writer and cultural critic based in @entity156 .			0
