-- friday was an extremely unusual day , astronomically speaking			1
just as scientists were gearing up to witness an asteroid 's closest ever approach to @entity5 in recorded history , a sizeable meteor exploded over @entity7 , causing thousands of injuries and major damage to buildings			1
the asteroid , named @entity12 , came within 17,000 miles or so , as close as a telecommunication satellite in geosynchronous orbit			2
@entity12 is quite a bit smaller than @entity16 , the asteroid that passed @entity5 in november 2011 , but @entity12 came more than 10 times closer			2
these two rare events occurred the same day			1
your inner mathematician and your inner prophet of the end times think they should be connected			2
but scientists say they are not			0
what gives ? 11 meteor tweets we wish we 'd thought of first , some facts			2
meteors are rocky bodies that enter the @entity5 's atmosphere			0
some are leftover debris out of which planets like @entity5 are formed , while others are the remnants of shattered comets and asteroids			0
as long as their orbit intersects the @entity5 's orbit , these rocks can in principle impact the @entity5			0
actually , this happens all the time , although usually the impacts occur in unpopulated regions since most of @entity5 is uninhabited			0
in fact , most meteors fall into the ocean simply because water covers two - thirds of the planet			0
so we do n't witness most meteor impacts			2
if one landed in @entity56 or @entity57 , people would definitely notice			0
fortunately , the odds are very much against hitting a densely populated region			0
the meteor that fell friday near @entity61 , @entity7 , was pretty big , maybe 50 feet across			1
in 1908 , a slightly larger meteor -- perhaps three times larger in diameter , or 27 times larger in mass -- flattened a thousand square miles of forest near @entity68 , @entity7 , downing some 80 million trees			1
@entity71 scientists estimate that meteors as large as friday 's might hit the @entity5 every decade or two , while @entity68 - like events are estimated to occur once every 1,000 years			1
the close fly - by of an asteroid like @entity12 , like the @entity68 meteor , is a once - in - 1,000 - years event			1
asteroids are large , irregular , rocky bodies orbiting the @entity80 roughly between @entity81 and @entity82			0
many have impacted the @entity5 over its 4.5 billion - year history -- as they have hit the moon , @entity81 and other planets -- leaving craters behind			0
a particularly large asteroid -- roughly 300 times larger across than @entity12 ( and 30 million times its volume , and far more rare ) -- created a planetary extinction event that did in dinosaurs 65 million years ago , allowing mammals to rise to their present - day prominence			1
opinion : meteor shows why it is crucial to keep an eye on the sky using @entity71 's @entity101 infrared satellite , astronomers estimate there are about 5,000 known meteors that can impact the @entity5 with sizes of about 100 feet or larger -- that is , larger than the @entity61 meteor			1
smaller ones are fainter and thus harder to find			0
it makes sense that smaller asteroids pass @entity5 more frequently and , on average , closer			0
that 's because in nature , small things are more common than big things			0
so asteroids like @entity16 are more rare than @entity12 , which in turn is more rare than the @entity61 meteor			1
because there are more @entity118 filling interplanetary space than @entity120 , a 50 - foot asteroid can be found in a smaller volume of space , on average , and thus closer to @entity5 , than a 150 - foot one			2
now let 's talk about coincidence			0
mathematicians frame this issue in terms of probability -- that is , the likelihood that something will happen			2
a rare thing is unlikely , so we say it has a low probability of occurring			1
two rare events happening at approximately the same time is much more unlikely			1
here is how to think of it mathematically : if the events are not associated , the probability of this coincidence comes from multiplying the individual probabilities			1
for example , the probability that your birthday is on a given date -- say , january 1 -- is 1/365			1
that is , of every 365 readers of this article , roughly one will have a birthday on january 1			2
five things to know about asteroids and meteors now , the probability that the next reader 's birthday is also on january 1 is 1/365 times 1/365 , or about 1 in 130,000			1
if that many people read the article , such a coincidence could happen			0
of course , it 's much more likely that two non-consecutive readers will have a birthday on january 1			2
and it 's very likely that lots of readers have the same birthday as other readers			0
( in fact , in any group of 23 or more people , it is more than 50 % likely that two will share a birthday , but calculating that probability is a bit more complicated			2
) back to the meteor and the asteroid			1
both events happening within one day makes us think they could be connected			1
that instinct comes from doing the math -- if it is improbable , then we think it can not be a coincidence			2
but the facts do n't support this conclusion			0
first of all , in the time between the two events , the @entity5 moved roughly 300,000 miles , meaning the asteroid and the meteor were in completely different places			1
moreover , they traveled in completely different directions , so they could n't have been associated			0
so there is no way the meteor and the asteroid are connected			1
it has to be a coincidence that the two events happened on the same day			1
yet this would seem to be at odds with our instinct that two very rare things would not happen at the same time			0
@entity7 scientists track down fragments of @entity208 meteor how can we reconcile these two opposite thoughts : the impossibility of an association based on the physics of trajectories , and the improbability of coincidence ( lack of association ) that the math suggests ? the answer is that we need to rethink the probability calculation			2
if asteroids as big as @entity12 pass close to @entity5 once every decade or two , and meteors as large as the @entity61 one impact once every 100 years ( a similar meteor having caused the tunguska event in 1908 ) , the chance of both events happening on any one day are indeed very small : 1 in 3,650 days times 1 in 36,500 days , or about 1 in 100 million -- not odds you would bet against			1
but think again : the @entity5 has been around for 4.5 billion years -- which is 1.6 trillion days			0
so the chance that these two events would happen on a day sometime in the earth 's history is actually larger than we first thought -- it ought to have happened about 12,000 times already			1
of course , during most of that 4.5 billion year history , the earth was not populated by intelligent life -- human beings who might have noticed the two events happening on the same day			1
so what is the probability that the meteor hits and the asteroid passes @entity5 on the same day when someone could record it on video ? that 's probably been possible for about 50 years , or only about five years if we have to do it on a smartphone or dashboard camera			1
that 's 1,825 days , which means the chance of someone filming the event is only about one in 70,000 -- and that 's if people blanketed the @entity5			0
given how sparsely the @entity5 is populated , we should correct this number downward by a ( large ! ) geographical factor			0
it 's also unlikely that this event would happen within 3,000 miles of the tunguska impact			0
what to think ? our rough calculation says a large meteor impact on the same day as closest passage of the @entity267 asteroid is really improbable			1
something in our assumptions could be wrong			0
for example , the frequency of meteor impacts could be much larger and our estimates too low because we do n't notice most of them			0
then again , maybe sometimes , long odds just pay off			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity278 .			2

@entity278 : friday was an extremely unusual day , astronomically speaking
@entity278 : the probability that a meteor hits and an asteroid passes by is improbable
she says the chance of the two events happening on the same day is about 1 in 100 million
@entity278 : even though we think they could be connected , the two rare events are not connected
