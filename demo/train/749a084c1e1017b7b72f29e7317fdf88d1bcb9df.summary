-- from a low - key ski destination to a @entity4 yurt retreat , we 've got the easy - going vacation for you			1
@entity7 , @entity8 skiing like you remember it : mountains like @entity11 are a dying breed : no parking lot hassles , no mile - long schlep to the ticket window , no $ 20 hamburgers			1
instead , drive right up to the ski lift , put on your boots , and drop into 2,500 acres of steeps , cruisers , and glades			0
the timbered @entity22 makes a homey slopeside basecamp			0
bonus : targhee 's 40th anniversary means $ 40 lift tickets and deep discounts on multi-night stays			0
from $ 129 ; 800/827 - 4433			1
-- @entity30 @entity31 : 15 great snowy getaways @entity33 , @entity34 off the grid on the coast : at @entity40 , just south of @entity33 in @entity39 , your cell signal obligingly vanishes when you pull in the drive , and there 's not a remote control in sight			1
which means you 'll have all the time in the world to hike along the headlands of surrounding @entity49 , scatter some corn for the inn 's chickens ( it 's only fair -- you 'll be eating their eggs come morning ) , and introduce yourself to the resident llamas			0
if you just want to hide out in your room -- for decor , think @entity58 meets @entity59 -- that 's fine too			1
your breakfast basket will be delivered to your door , along with a newspaper ... which we encourage you to ignore			0
from $ 139 , including breakfast ; 707/937 - 0083			1
-- @entity66 @entity31 : 7 warming winter trips @entity68 , @entity69 a yesteryear lodge in the woods : along the @entity72 in @entity69 's @entity73 , tiny @entity68 is the kind of community where elk and deer outnumber human residents -- the perfect place to hide out			1
@entity83 's 11 rooms , all knotty pine and log walls , have luxe touches and fluffy beds that make you want to curl up and get cozy , but they 're blissfully free of tvs and phones			2
pry yourself out of your room to borrow the resort 's complimentary cross-country skis or snowshoes for treks through the snowy meadows and forest			0
from $ 89 ; two - night minimum on weekends ; 928/735 - 7216			2
-- @entity97 @entity31 : top 10 winter weekends @entity99 , @entity99 @entity100 : way up at the northern point of the @entity99 , past the fancy resorts everyone has heard of , there 's a lush and little - known area of former sugar towns			1
about a year ago , the @entity108 opened nine rooms in a green valley here			0
now , its just - finished , solar - powered " yurt village " has put the hidden retreat firmly within reach for any budget			1
seven sturdy tent bungalows stand next to a saltwater swimming pool , spa , shower house , and organic garden			0
the famed beaches of the @entity122 are a half - hour away , but what almost no one seems to know ( yet ) is that there are enough waterfalls , breezy beaches , and seafood joints to keep a person content right here			2
yurts from $ 175 ; 808/889 - 6336			2
-- @entity131 @entity132 , @entity34 warm up in a snowy mountain cabin : reclaim winter 's quiet at @entity135 , where charming cabins with fireplaces and patchwork quilts hide out among the trees just outside @entity141 's resorty core			1
by day , share 19 miles of groomed cross-country trails with just a few solitude - loving skiers			2
by night , return to the 1924 lodge for warm drinks and dessert in front of the massive river - rock fireplace			0
lodge rooms from $ 79 , fireplace cabins from $ 169 ; 760/934 - 2442			0
