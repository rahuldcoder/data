@entity1 , @entity0 -- you 're overseas			0
you 're driving alone when disaster strikes			0
you 've crashed your car and you need help			0
who do you call ? in an emergency , it 's easier to remember just one number			1
you might not know the number for the local emergency services , or that it 's 999 in @entity14 ; 15 , 17 and 18 in @entity15 ; or 10111 and 10177 in @entity16			1
but do you know that there is one internationally - recognized number that will connect you to the emergency services across @entity20 and even further beyond ? the 112 emergency number was first introduced in 1991 so that @entity20 citizens could dial just one number , rather than have to memorize a different one for each country			1
the number is now operational in all 27 @entity26 member states			1
it should also redirect to emergency services on gsm cell phones in countries including the @entity31 ( see box below )			2
but 18 years after 112 's introduction , it is still largely unheard of			2
a 2009 @entity36 survey revealed that only 24 percent of @entity20 are aware of the number			1
in @entity38 , nine percent know about it , eight percent in the @entity14 and only three percent in @entity40			2
the lack of awareness is partly the fault of older @entity26 member states including the @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity40 that have been reluctant to advertise the number , said @entity46 from the @entity47 ( @entity48 ) that was set up to promote 112			1
technical issues and language barriers also have n't helped			0
@entity48 told @entity2 the number still does not have 100 percent coverage across @entity20			1
and 29 percent of people in the @entity36 survey said they had encountered language problems when making an emergency call in another @entity26 country			1
" officially , 19 member states are able to answer in @entity60 , " said @entity58			1
" but that 's wrong			0
" @entity48 recently sent journalists to make calls from outside the @entity64 in @entity65			0
even here , from the center of @entity20 , staff could not immediately respond in @entity60 , let alone other @entity20 languages such as @entity71 or @entity72 , he said			1
but with new member states from central and eastern @entity20 adopting -- and actively supporting -- 112 , @entity48 believes there is now is an opportunity to increase awareness and encourage more countries to upgrade the quality of their services			1
watch @entity2 @entity81 for more safety tips Â» bilingual interpreters given the difficulties accessing emergency services when abroad , travelers are increasingly turning to commercial services to get them out of tricky situations			1
services such as " @entity91 " from @entity92 in the @entity14 and @entity93 from the @entity31 provide 24 - hour access to interpreters who speak over 170 languages and can help with anything from dealing with a medical emergency to finding a restaurant			1
@entity92 founder @entity100 came up with the idea for the service after a harrowing experience whilst on holiday in @entity105			0
" it was 2am , my two - year - old was screaming and we needed an ambulance			2
but i did n't have a clue who to call , " he told @entity2			0
over 150 people are signing up for the service every day , he said			0
a common request is for help with lost passports			0
" we can get people to the nearest embassy and can arrange for transportation if need it , " said @entity100			0
new tools tech - savvy travelers are also taking matters into their own hands and using social media tools such as blogs , location - based technologies , and instant messaging services to respond to emergencies			1
research published in @entity133 magazine last year by @entity134 , assistant professor of computer science at the @entity136 , revealed that social networking sites , including @entity138 , were more effective than government emergency services when it came to distributing information during emergencies such as the @entity143 shooting of april 2007			2
social networking tools are particularly useful during disasters when cell networks go down but sms services remain in action			2
with this in mind , the @entity149 has worked with @entity138 for its " @entity153 " site so people can register their whereabouts during a disaster , as well as check on people they know			0
people are also using social networking and location - based technologies to help co-ordinate rescue efforts			2
last month , friends of two @entity14 skiers who went missing in @entity165 in the @entity166 used @entity138 to find their friends ' cell phone numbers			0
they then helped mountain rescue teams locate one missing skier by using gps and @entity172 from his cell phone			0
@entity172 's @entity175 service , launched in february , constantly updates users ' location , enabling contacts to see their whereabouts on a map as well as their activity via status updates			2
privacy issues aside , the service could prove invaluable for people traveling alone in unfamiliar areas or dangerous situations			0
smart phone applications such as @entity188 ( @entity189 ) for the @entity190 provide one - touch emergency contacts and first aid information in the event of an incident			1
several phone makers , including @entity196 and @entity197 , also offer sos functions that , with the push of a button , send text messages to pre-set numbers and warn that the sender is in danger			0
with an ever - growing array of automatic services for cell phones , we may never need to remember an emergency number again -- whether that 's 112 or not .			1

emergency number 112 was introduced in 1991 , works in all @entity26 member states
