-- by the end of the @entity3 on sunday night , one or more professional football players will be hailed for their valor , for their guts , for their devotion to their teammates			1
they will be called heroes			1
and more than 100 million people will be watching			2
but because , predictably , those laudatory words will be thrown around so casually on sunday , perhaps we can take a few minutes here to address an act of genuine valor that happened exactly 70 years ago today			2
on february 3 , 1943 , an @entity19 transport ship called the @entity20 , carrying @entity22 soldiers through the icy @entity23 on their way to serve in @entity25 , was about 100 miles off the coast of @entity27 in rough sea			1
more than 900 people were on board			2
many of them were little more than boys -- young soldiers and sailors who had never been so far from home			1
the journey had been arduous already , with the men crammed into claustrophobic , all - but - airless sleeping quarters below deck , constantly ill from the violent lurching of the ship			1
in the blackness of night , a @entity43 submarine fired torpedoes at the @entity20			2
one of the torpedoes hit the middle of the ship			1
there was pandemonium on board			0
the @entity20 swiftly began to sink			0
the soldiers and sailors , many of them wakened from sleep by the attack , searched desperately in the dark for life jackets and lifeboats and a route to safety			1
with them on the ship were four military chaplains , from four disparate religions			1
they were father @entity63 , born in @entity64 , @entity65 , who was @entity67 ; the rev. @entity68 , born in @entity69 , @entity70 , who was ordained in the @entity72 ; rabbi @entity73 , born in @entity74 , @entity75 , who was @entity77 ; and the rev. @entity78 , born in @entity79 , @entity80 , who was @entity82			0
in the chaos onboard , according to multiple accounts by survivors of the attack , the four men tried to calm the soldiers and sailors and lead them to evacuation points			1
the chaplains were doing what chaplains do : providing comfort and guidance and hope			1
" i could hear men crying , pleading , praying , " a soldier named @entity97 would later recall			0
" i could also hear the chaplains preaching courage			1
their voices were the only thing that kept me going			0
" with the @entity20 rapidly taking on water , there were not enough life jackets readily available for every man on the ship			1
so , when the life jackets ran out , the four chaplains removed their own , and handed them to soldiers who did n't have them			1
more than 600 men died that night in the frigid seas , but some 230 were rescued			0
and some of the survivors , in official accounts given to the @entity19 , and in interviews after the war , reported what they saw as the ship went down : those four chaplains , men of different faiths but believing in the same @entity124 , their arms linked , standing on the deck together in prayer			1
they had willingly given up their futures , their lives , to try to help the men who had been placed by the @entity19 in their care			1
the @entity131 has in its records a narrative of what happened that night			0
one of the men who survived the sinking of the @entity20 , a @entity138 officer named @entity139 , is quoted as recalling that before heading for the lifeboats , he hurried in the direction of his quarters			0
rabbi @entity73 , seeing him , asked where he was going			0
@entity139 said he had forgotten his gloves , and wanted to retrieve them before being dropped into the cold sea			0
rabbi @entity73 said that @entity139 should not waste fleeting time , and offered @entity139 his own gloves			0
when @entity139 said he could n't deprive rabbi @entity73 of his gloves , the rabbi said it was all right , he had two pairs			0
only later , according to military historians , did @entity139 realize that of course , rabbi @entity73 was not carrying an extra pair of gloves			0
he had already decided that he was going down with the ship			2
according to the @entity131 account , another survivor of the @entity20 , @entity159 , said of the four chaplains ' selfless act : " it was the finest thing i have seen or hope to see this side of heaven			2
" the story of the four chaplains was quite well known in @entity22 for a while ; in 1948 a first - class 3 - cent postage stamp was issued bearing their likenesses			2
there are still stained glass windows in some chapels across the @entity22 that pay tribute to the four men , including at the @entity176			0
but the national memory is short , and they are no longer much discussed			0
february 3 was , years ago , designated by @entity179 to be set aside annually as @entity180 , but it is not widely commemorated			0
this @entity186 , with its football heroes whose televised exploits are bracketed by commercials for beer and corn chips , will be no exception			1
the nation 's attention , this february 3 , will be focused on the game			0
but perhaps , at some point in the day , we can pause for a moment to reflect upon what valor and courage and sacrifice really mean			2
how rare they truly are			0
and to recall the four men who remain , in the words with which their grateful and humbled country honored them on the front of that long - ago postage stamp , " these immortal chaplains			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			1

@entity208 : on @entity186 , football players will be called gutsy , heroic
he says for real heroism , look to four @entity25 chaplains who sacrificed lives on this day in 1943
he says the helped young soldiers to safety , giving up life vests , when their ship hit
@entity208 : they went down with ship . think of them while you *'re* cheering football " heroes "
