@entity0 -- for a war vet from @entity3 , a leisurely road trip to a seaside vacation came to an abrupt end in @entity7 , where he has languished behind bars for four months , sometimes chained to a bed			1
for the first few months , @entity12 's parents kept his plight out of the public eye , fearing that media attention could bring harm to him in prison			1
but now they are coming forward , hoping the publicity will push @entity7 authorities to act			1
@entity12 , 27 , is being held in the border town of @entity21 , just across from @entity22 , @entity23			1
it is notorious as the home of the @entity26 , one of @entity7 's major drug trafficking organizations			1
" the only reason they were going to stop was to get more gas , " his father said			1
@entity12 , who served in @entity34 and @entity35 as a @entity36 , was headed to @entity37 in august to go surfing with a fellow veteran			1
he had surfed there before and packed every good surf board he had , his parents said			2
but he also took one item that quickly became troublesome : an antique shotgun handed down from his great - grandfather			1
opinion : a father 's plea : end the war on drugs he intended to hunt with it , his parents said			2
and he declared it with @entity53 border agents			2
but after he drove his @entity55 a few feet farther to the @entity7 side , authorities arrested him , saying the weapon did not comply with their gun laws			2
" the crime that he 's charged with is possession of a weapon that 's restricted for military use , " said his mother , @entity59			1
a branch of the @entity7 military has said the gun is not on its " forbidden list , " she said			2
but the @entity36 remains incarcerated			2
@entity7 officials said that the files on the case were not immediately available because the arrest happened so long ago			2
an official at the prosecutor 's office declined to comment			0
a few nights after @entity12 's arrest , his parents received the first of several threatening calls from behind bars , they said			1
" he said : i have your son , " @entity59 recalled , tearing up			0
" i am going to f --- him up			0
" then she heard her son 's voice			0
" he said : @entity88 , you 've got to do what they say ; they 're really serious			0
" the voice at the other end of the line asked for $ 1,800			0
@entity53 sen. @entity95 , a @entity96 from @entity3 , stepped in on @entity12 's behalf , speaking to @entity7 's ambassador to the @entity53			1
" we interceded to get him out of the general prison population , " @entity95 said			0
this served to remove @entity12 from contact with dangerous inmates			1
the calls have since stopped , his mother said			0
" he is now being kept in a low ... intensity place , more like an administrative place , " @entity95 said			0
but because of the low security of the new facility , which @entity59 describes as a storage shed , officials periodically chain @entity12 to his bed			1
the @entity112 recently turned to their @entity53 congresswoman , @entity113 , who heads the @entity114			0
" this is outrageous , " @entity113 said			0
she has spoken with the @entity116 and the @entity53 ambassador to @entity7 , and will meet with the @entity7 ambassador to the @entity53 this week			0
" enough is enough , " she said			0
" @entity122 , we 're going to get you out of there , " @entity59 said to her son by phone friday			0
he reminded her that she has been telling him that since august			0
their son returned to them safe and unharmed from @entity34 and @entity35			1
@entity12 's parents now fear they could lose him just across the border , if they wait too much longer			1
