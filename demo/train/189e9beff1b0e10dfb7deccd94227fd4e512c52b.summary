-- @entity1 is digging into his wallet to dig into the @entity3 and its owners			1
in his latest salvo against the league that 's moved to oust him over racist remarks , the embattled @entity6 co-owner has hired " multiple private investigation firms " to look into alleged discriminatory conduct by fellow team owners and the @entity3 itself , said a person familiar with @entity17 's legal strategy			1
he will give each firm a budget of $ 50,000 and 30 days to finish an investigation , according to this source , who is not authorized to speak publicly and spoke to @entity0 on condition of anonymity			1
the billionaire real estate mogul bought the @entity6 in 1981 for about $ 12 million ; his estranged wife , @entity25 , recently reached an agreement with former @entity28 ceo @entity27 to sell the franchise for $ 2 billion			0
after initially signaling his openness to this deal , @entity1 has backed off			2
not only wo n't he sell the franchise -- as league leaders have insisted should happen -- but @entity1 insists he wo n't pay a $ 2.5 million fine or accept a lifetime ban ordered by @entity3 commissioner @entity36			1
@entity1 's camp recently filed a lawsuit against the @entity3 and its efforts to force a sale			1
asked whether the latest development -- hiring private eyes to look into the league 's business and its 29 other owners -- means that @entity1 has decided to take the proverbial gloves off to fight the @entity3 , the source familiar with his legal strategy said that assessment was not fair			1
" i think the @entity3 took the gloves off , " said the source , citing the league 's actions and its siding in court with @entity55 in her own efforts to finish off the @entity6 ' sale			1
a source with knowledge of the @entity3 's position said friday that the decision to hire private investigators " is not uncommon practice by lawyers to drum up allegations and scare tactics to attempt to obfuscate the real issue			1
" in this case , according to this source , the apparent aim is to cover up " the conduct of mr. @entity1 that led to his deserved ban and $ 2.5 million fine			1
" " this is not just obfuscation , " the source added , " but a strategy of intimidation that will not work and only further demonstrate that mr. @entity1 is unfit to own a team			1
" private eyes will probe bias cases , pay for execs the source said that the private investigators will look into discrimination cases filed by @entity86 and women targeting the @entity3			1
@entity1 's camp knows of at least 12 such cases of alleged discrimination dating back to 2008 , about half of which involve pregnant women who filed complaints against the league office , said the source			1
the investigators will also try to dig up instances where league owners made questionable remarks , including anything that would be considered sexist or racist , a source told the @entity102			2
the @entity102 described its source as a person familiar with @entity17 's legal strategy , though it was n't immediately clear whether this was the same person who talked to @entity0			2
@entity1 came under fire in april , when @entity108 posted audio of him talking to his companion @entity110			0
the release spurred an uproar among league officials , fans and players , who reportedly threatened to boycott playing in the @entity3 playoffs if @entity1 still was in control of the @entity6			1
that 's when @entity36 stepped in , swiftly banishing @entity17 from any team or league activities and promising to work to oust him as an owner			0
the @entity6 co-owner defended his actions -- including a @entity0 interview that drew more harsh criticism for remarks about basketball legend @entity127 -- and went back - and - forth about what to do , before apparently settling on an all - out fight with the league			0
@entity1 voiced particular dismay about the @entity3 commissioner , who took over that job earlier in 2014 after years in the league office			1
to that end , the investigators he 's hired will look into compensation paid to top @entity3 executives , past and present , according to @entity0 's source familiar with @entity17 's legal strategy			1
as to investigating fellow @entity3 owners , this source said @entity1 was reluctant to do so , but felt he needed to at this time			1
dispute over @entity1 's mental state , family trust while a large - scale investigation certainly marks an escalation , it ca n't come as a total surprise			2
earlier this week , the 80 - year - old @entity1 defiantly called the @entity3 " a band of hypocrites and bullies " that needs to examine its own " discriminatory practices " rather than try to take away his personal property			2
this happened days after he sued the @entity3 for more than $ 1 billion over its decision to ban him for life and force him to sell the franchise			2
" we have to fight for the rights of all @entity86			0
we have to fight these despicable monsters , " @entity1 wrote in a statement , provided to @entity0 by @entity162 , one of his lawyers			0
talking to @entity165 about the @entity17 accusation at the halftime of an @entity3 finals game between the @entity169 and the @entity170 , @entity36 said he had " no idea what he 's talking about			0
" " this is about @entity1 and his conduct , " the commissioner said			0
" and if he wants to litigate , he 'll litigate			0
" the @entity3 is n't alone in its fight			0
it 's joined by @entity55 , who has asked a @entity179 probate court to uphold her negotiated sale of the team despite her husband 's objections			0
the probate court will hold a four - day hearing next month that will focus on whether she has the power to sell the team if her co-owner is incapacitated			0
the @entity102 source said the probate court decision prompted @entity1 to hire the investigators			2
mrs. @entity55 regrets having to go to court and publicly air this problem , " said her attorney , @entity192			0
" but mr. @entity1 's conduct in reneging on the sale requires her to do so			0
" though the @entity6 are owned by a family trust , @entity55 's attorney has said three physicians certified that @entity1 lacks the mental capacity to function as a trustee			0
" the trust agreement provides that if two qualified physicians certify that he 's mentally incapacitated , he 's removed , " @entity192 said			0
though she said three doctors have reviewed evidence and concluded that @entity1 is mentally incapacitated , his lawyer has said he is far from incapacitated			0
who is @entity27 ? probate court to hold trial on @entity55 's plan to sell @entity6 @entity1 says @entity3 officials are ' bullies , ' ' hypocrites , ' ' monsters ' @entity0 's @entity216 contributed to this report .			2
