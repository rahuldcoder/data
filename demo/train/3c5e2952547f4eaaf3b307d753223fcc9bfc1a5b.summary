-- whenever a new baby is on the way , the family ca n't help but speculate on what the little one might look like			1
will he or she have straight hair like @entity7 or curly hair like @entity9 ? be tall like @entity10 or short and stubby like @entity12 ? when the new arrival is the future king or queen of @entity16 , more than just the family wants to know			2
@entity18 , @entity19 , is reportedly due to give birth july 13 , and the world will watch as the baby grows up			2
will he or she turn out to have blue eyes like @entity26 or green ones like @entity18 ? be light - haired like @entity7 or dark - haired like @entity9 ? will prince @entity29 ' ears be passed on to a future generation ? online bets are already being placed on the child 's hair color			1
whatever happens , this baby might stand out genetically among royals because his mother is the first commoner to marry into the royal family since the 17th century			2
marriage within a relatively small gene pool , like the royals , means a bad gene has a pretty good chance of rearing its ugly head			0
the blood clotting disorder hemophilia , for example , has run in the @entity46 royal family			0
" it 's very good that they 're bringing in new genes , " said dr. @entity47 , a consultant in the @entity48 at @entity49 in @entity50			0
" it freshens up the gene pool			0
" royal baby slightly more likely to be female , scientist says @entity18 's commoner genes might lead to a somewhat darker - skinned baby , @entity47 said			1
the royals , he explained , are pretty pale			0
@entity18 's skin has a considerably more olive tone , and the baby will likely be somewhere between the two -- but more like @entity18 because her genes are dominant over lighter ones			1
" the odds are the child will have darker skin color than the royals might be used to , " @entity47 said			1
the same is true for eye color			0
the chances that the baby will have true blue eyes like @entity26 's are relatively unlikely			1
most likely , @entity47 said , the baby 's eyes will be a shade closer to @entity18 's			1
with hair color , there are basically four options : light like @entity7 , dark like @entity9 , a shade in between the two or red like the baby 's @entity83			1
@entity47 said it 's possible to calculate the odds of a redhead			0
based on the fact that @entity26 's brother , prince @entity83 , is a ginger , there 's a 66 % chance that @entity26 carries a gene for red hair , he said			1
@entity95 is known about @entity18 's heritage , but assuming it 's similar to the genes of other @entity46 people , he calculates there 's a 6 % chance the baby will have red hair			1
apparently @entity46 are more confident the baby will have red hair			1
at @entity107 online betting , there are 4 - 1 odds the baby will be a ginger			0
" if you 're going to put some money on it , you might want to think about it , " @entity47 said			0
while hair color might be debatable , one physical trait seems pretty clear : @entity26 and @entity18 's child will likely be quite tall			1
@entity26 is reportedly around 6 foot 3 inches tall , and his wife about 5 feet 10 inches			2
a son would likely be between 5 feet 11 inches and 6 feet 7 inches , and a daughter between 5 feet 6 inches and 6 feet 2 inches , according to @entity122 , director of outreach at the department of genetics at @entity126			0
of course , it 's impossible to use genetics to predict completely what any baby will look like , royal or not			2
" that 's the fun of having babies , " @entity47 said			0
" you do n't know what you 're going to get			0
" video : royal note to reveal baby 's gender @entity0 's @entity139 and @entity140 contributed to this report .			2

the royal baby might have blue eyes like @entity26 or green ones like @entity18
it 's likely the baby will have darker skin than most royals , an expert says
royal *offspring* may also have red hair like uncle -- prince @entity83
