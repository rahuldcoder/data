as @entity0 swept through @entity1 and emergency crews scrambled to rescue victims , @entity4 was responding to cries for help and offering words of comfort -- all in 140 characters or less			1
@entity4 runs the @entity12 's @entity11 account , which proved to be a lifeline of sorts for many stranded @entity1			1
she responded to hundreds of tweets pleading for help , most of them in the first hour or two after @entity0 made landfall			1
" you could see the panic and fear in the words they were typing , " said @entity4 , who stayed at her desk through the night			1
" people were so scared they were reaching out to anyone they thought might listen			0
it really struck a chord with me			2
i tried to help them as best as i could			0
" while hundreds of thousands of callers jammed emergency lines , @entity4 says , " a lot of people could n't get through to a 911 dispatcher			1
so i took their information and called our dispatchers myself to make sure they sent an emergency crew			0
" as the social media manager for the fire department , @entity4 says she always tweets out alerts to her 53,000 followers during emergencies			1
but this one was unique			0
@entity4 says she was prepared for the worst monday night , but did n't anticipate the hundreds of messages she received from terrified people unable to reach 911			1
at times , she said , the sheer volume of tweets was overwhelming , but under the circumstances she considered it part of the job			2
@entity4 used @entity11 to post updates on rising water levels from the storm surge , the broken crane dangling high above @entity59 and a fire that raged through the @entity62 section of @entity63 , destroying dozens of homes			1
what happened during those first few hours is still mostly a blur , she said , but she will never forget some of the frantic pleas			2
" one couple and their baby had moved to the second floor of their home because of floodwaters , " she said			1
" they were terrified the water would reach them			0
" as the night passed , the @entity12 @entity11 feed filled up with conversations between @entity4 and the city 's distressed victims			1

she says one of her goals that night was to help keep people calm			0
" i reassured everyone asking for our help that rescuers would eventually reach them , " she said			0
her efforts have earned her a flurry of praise and media attention , with one headline calling her a " one - woman response team			0
" but @entity4 said the rescuers risking their lives were the real heroes of the storm			2
" i think the firefighters who were in 6 feet of water in @entity62 trying to put out those fires are the heroes			0
and the @entity118 members , who are going house to house in boats trying to save people in severe conditions , not knowing what they 're walking into -- they 're the heroes			0
" i was just sitting at my desk trying my best to keep up			0
and i did a very small part of what went on that night , " added @entity4 , who credits adrenaline and the energy of her co-workers with keeping her going through the night			2
" i was getting loopy toward the end of it and probably was n't making any sense whatsoever			0
" days later , @entity4 is still dealing with storm victims , some of whom apparently do n't realize she 's an army of one			1
" amazing to see the @ @entity12 using @ @entity11 to respond to emergencies , " wrote one @entity11 user			1
" i 'd love to see the behind the scenes of how that 's working			0
" for @entity4 , the most gratifying feedback has been follow - up responses from people who had sent her panicked tweets in @entity0 's terrifying early hours			1
they " let me know that they were rescued , " she said			0
