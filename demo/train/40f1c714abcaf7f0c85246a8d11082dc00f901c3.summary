near the @entity2 - @entity1 border -- hopes were briefly raised then dashed tuesday for an imminent calm between @entity2 and @entity6 as diplomats fervently sought a way to stop the deadly violence			1
@entity11 secretary of state @entity10 arrived in the region , where she met for more than two hours with @entity2 prime minister @entity13			1
she is expected to meet later with @entity15 president @entity14 and @entity17 president @entity16 , who is working to broker a cease - fire			1
@entity1 is run by @entity6 , which the @entity11 and other countries consider a terrorist organization			1

she thanked @entity17 and especially @entity16 for their efforts			0
@entity10 's farewell tour takes detour " president @entity34 asked me to come to @entity2 with a very clear message			1
@entity11 's commitment to @entity2 's security is rock solid and unwavering			1
that is why we believe it is essential to de-escalate the situation in @entity1 , " she said			0
" the goal must be a durable outcome that promotes regional stability and advances the security and legitimate aspirations of @entity2 and @entity49 alike			1

opinion : how this could be the last @entity1 war @entity6 spokesman @entity65 later said that @entity2 had not agreed to terms that would stop the fighting			1
similarly , @entity17 's @entity16 said the " travesty of the @entity2 aggression on @entity1 will end in a few hours			2
" but a few hours passed , and @entity16 's office told @entity3 not to expect any announcement tuesday night			0
a " calming down " could halt violence , but it is not the same as an official cease - fire or truce			1
@entity2 has said it wants a cease - fire agreement but has not indicated whether one could be imminent			1
" obviously , no country can tolerate a wanton attack on its civilians , " said @entity13 , standing beside @entity21			0
" now , if there is a possibility of achieving a long - term solution to this problem through diplomatic means , we prefer that			2
but if not , i 'm sure you understand that @entity2 will have to take whatever actions necessary to defend its people			1
" @entity13 accused " terrorist enemies " of " doing everything in their power to maximize the number of civilian casualties			0
" according to the @entity1 @entity99 , 27 people were killed tuesday , including children , and 137 @entity49 have been killed since the latest hostilities erupted			1

it climbed from four to five , according to the hospital , when a 30 - year - old @entity118 was killed			2
@entity2 said it was holding off on a ground offensive into @entity1 to give diplomatic efforts time			2
those efforts include talks with @entity21 and @entity124 @entity123 ban ki - moon			0
a source familiar with discussions in @entity28 told @entity3 , " one of the @entity2 demands is that there should be a period of total calm for 24 hours before committing to any agreement			2
" how this conflict reignited @entity2 spokesman @entity134 told @entity3 , " diplomacy is still ongoing			1
" " it 's in the hands now of the @entity2 , " @entity136 , @entity6 spokesman in @entity137 , told @entity3 earlier by phone			1
" ... i think the @entity17 are waiting for some support , promised support , from the @entity11 in order to make an end for that			2
so we expect to have an outcome of this issue today as president @entity16 has said			0
" that " expected " outcome did n't arrive			0
speaking early wednesday , @entity136 said he believes @entity6 and @entity2 are close to a cease - fire agreement			1
" i can say that we are close , and we are on the edge			0
it may happen , and it may not , " he said			0
later , @entity136 added , " i believe there is a good chance to have a cease - fire , which can fulfill the needs of both sides			1
" a timeline of the @entity2 - @entity1 conflict @entity134 said @entity2 is not interested in a " time out , " allowing @entity6 to regroup after @entity2 strikes have done damage			1
" we want a new reality " in which @entity2 do n't live under rocket fire from @entity6 , he said			1
to succeed , negotiations have to be done " discreetly , " he said			0
@entity136 said @entity6 ' actions have been " a good lesson for the @entity2 government			1
it 's not good to attack the @entity49 , expecting that they will not react against the attack			0
" asked whether @entity6 would accept @entity2 's right to exist , @entity136 said the @entity15 people would not consider it without an end to occupation			1
smuggling weapons to @entity1 -- the long way the onslaught of rockets fired tuesday into @entity2 continued to be met by @entity2 strikes on sites in @entity1			2
attacks included one aimed at @entity28 , one that caused casualties in the southern town of @entity189 , and one that injured five @entity2 soldiers			2
another rocket hit a civilian building in @entity196 , part of metropolitan @entity198 , @entity193 spokeswoman @entity192 said			2
@entity13 , at a news conference with @entity200 , said @entity2 was fighting back with " surgical operations against terrorists at a time when our own population is being bombarded by rocket attacks			2
" " if we hope to make these tactics illegitimate , they should be condemned in the most forceful terms by all responsible members of the international community , " he said			0
" the moment we draw symmetry between the victims of terror and the unintended casualties that result from legitimate military action against the terrorists , the minute that false symmetry is drawn , the terrorists win			0
" in @entity2 , @entity222 ca n't keep the fear away speaking later at a news conference with @entity2 president @entity225 , @entity200 urged diplomacy and said further escalation would put the region at risk			2

" further escalation benefits no one			0
now is the time for diplomacy			0
