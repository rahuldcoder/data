@entity0 -- grandparents , retirees and struggling seniors have waited months for this			0
seniors will receive their stimulus payments the same way they receive their @entity10 funds			1
tens of millions of @entity10 recipients will see their bank accounts jump by $ 250 starting thursday , when the government began sending out checks and transferring funds for a one - time boost coming from the stimulus bill passed in february			1
the payments are flowing to nearly 55 million seniors and retirees between now and june 4 , with a huge batch of checks hitting the mail this week			1
" approximately half of them will be out in the next day or two , " @entity10 commissioner @entity25 told @entity1 thursday			0
the money will arrive in the same way that each person receives regular @entity10 or @entity31 funds			1
if a person receives a @entity10 check in the mail , the $ 250 stimulus payment will also appear in his or her mailbox			1
an increasing number of people use direct deposit , so many seniors and @entity31 recipients could see the $ 250 boost in their accounts immediately			1
@entity10 and @entity31 recipients make up the largest groups to get the stimulus money , but it will also go out to railroad retirees and disabled veterans			2
agencies serving those groups will release the funds separately			0
all told , the government estimates some 64 million @entity53 will receive the one - time stimulus checks this year , at a cost of $ 13 billion to the federal budget			2
this comes as the @entity59 administration continues a public relations push to show that the $ 787 billion stimulus act is warming up the economy			0
@entity25 noted that these $ 250 payments are going out weeks before the deadline and are , by far , the largest single stimulus payment to individual @entity53			1
" this is a point in time where some of the first big chunks of stimulus money is actually going into the economy , " @entity25 said			0
meanwhile , there is vigorous debate over how stimulus payments will be spent in tough times			2
will the checks do anything for the overall economy ? @entity25 's agency has asked seniors to e-mail and tell what they plan to do with the $ 250			2
he admits that some have said they expect to save the money or pay off debts , but he insists that many responses listed hands - on spending			0
" we get people who say they 'll buy paint , we get people who say they 'll buy furniture , " he said			0
" quite a few of our recipients say they 'll buy clothes or school supplies for their grandkids			0

stimulus payments to be sent to 55 million recipients between now and june 4
$ 250 payments are for people who receive @entity10 , @entity31 funds
money will come in same form as regular payments -- mailed check or direct deposit
@entity10 chief says many people will spend their checks rather than saving
