-- @entity1 had one hand on the @entity4 trophy but an unexpected 2 - 0 defeat sunday at @entity6 has thrown the three - way title race in @entity8 wide open again			1
at the end of a momentous week which has seen @entity1 reach the @entity14 final for the second time , @entity10 's men came unstuck against the mid-table team based in @entity17			1
even now , hopes of a first domestic championship in 18 years remain in the hands of the @entity21 if they win their remaining two games -- at home to @entity24 then crucially away to defending champions @entity25			0
city rivals and fellow @entity14 finalists @entity28 later failed to take full advantage of @entity1 's defeat and needed an audacious late equalizer from @entity32 in a 2 - 2 draw against @entity17 in the @entity34			1
real twice trailed to goals from @entity36 and @entity37 only for @entity38 and @entity32 with a backheel from a @entity41 cross in injury time to rescue their title hopes			2
@entity25 , whose 2 - 2 draw at home to @entity48 appeared to have ended their chances , will be hoping @entity28 slip up again in their remaining three matches and that they can achieve a last - day win over @entity1 in the @entity52 to claim the title again			1
earlier , @entity6 went ahead against @entity1 after seven minutes through a @entity55 own goal but were indebted to goalkeeper @entity56 for a string of fine saves to deny the visitors			2
desperately searching for an equalizer , @entity1 were caught out with a quick break midway through the second half when @entity63 converted from @entity65 ' cross			0
@entity66 , a hero in the midweek win at @entity68 in the @entity14 semifinal , hit the post to sum up @entity1 's day in front of goal , but they now face a nervous run - in			1
in the @entity75 , the three - way title race effectively became two as @entity68 stumbled to a goalless draw at home to relegation haunted @entity80			1
the draw at @entity82 does little to help either side , with @entity68 now trailing leaders @entity84 and @entity86 by a point , but having played a game more			0
it was a lackluster display by @entity91 's men after the 3 - 1 setback against @entity1 , although they were unlucky when @entity93 and @entity94 hit the woodwork with efforts			2
@entity80 battled hard and had a first half penalty appeal turned away , but they are two points from safety and have played a game more than @entity101 , who are safe in 17th after a 1 - 0 win at @entity104 saturday			0
in the other match in the @entity75 sunday , fourth - placed @entity105 beat @entity107 1 - 0 with @entity108 scoring the only goal in the first half			1
the title race in @entity8 and @entity112 will almost certainly go down to the last round of matches , but in @entity116 @entity115 wrapped up their third straight @entity118 crown with three games to spare			1
@entity115 did not need to take to the pitch as closest rivals @entity121 suffered a shock 4 - 1 defeat at @entity125 sunday			2
it left @entity121 eight points adrift of the leaders with only two more games to be played			0
@entity131 's double for @entity125 put them on the front foot before @entity121 skipper @entity134 pulled one back before the break			0
goals from @entity137 and @entity138 wrapped up the win for @entity125 in the second half to lift them off the bottom of the table			0
@entity145 's newly - crowned champions will celebrate their latest @entity147 success and 30th in all with a home game against @entity149 monday .			0

@entity1 falter in @entity4 title race losing 2 - 0 at @entity6
new : @entity28 held 2 - 2 by @entity17 in late match
