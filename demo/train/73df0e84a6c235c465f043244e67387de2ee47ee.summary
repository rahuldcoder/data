-- nearly two years ago , after @entity3 's presidential campaign went down to defeat , i gave some ideas in these pages on @entity0 about how @entity7 can win future elections			1
on that list was an instruction that @entity7 need to stop being the " stupid party			1
" while it is true that we as @entity7 need to do a better job articulating our principles and being the party of bold new ideas , the @entity12 have a far worse problem			1
@entity12 need to stop being the party that thinks @entity21 themselves are stupid			1
to take one example : at a @entity26 hearing in april , members asked @entity28 official @entity27 if the @entity30 administration believed it could delay @entity32 's individual mandate , much as the @entity28 delayed the employer mandate			1
@entity27 's response was stunning : " if we believe it is fair to individuals to keep that ( individual mandate ) in place because it protects them ... then we do n't reach the question ( of ) whether we have legal authority			1
" the level of sheer arrogance in that response boggles the mind			2
a @entity28 spokesman later publicly disclosed the @entity30 administration 's official position : the federal government , namely the @entity49 , is requiring all individuals to purchase insurance to " protect " the @entity21 people from themselves			1
lest anyone think this attitude comes from anywhere other than the very top of the @entity30 administration , take the president 's own comments last october			1
in a speech in @entity60 at the peak of the controversy surrounding insurance cancellations , the president repeatedly derided canceled plans as " substandard ... cut - rate plans that do n't offer real financial protection			2
" and he did n't just insult the plans themselves , he insulted the people who purchased them : " a lot of people thought they were buying coverage , and it turned out to be not so good			0
" in other words , if you like your current plan , you 're delusional — or a dimwit			2
the president soon backtracked , and unilaterally waived portions of the bill he signed into law , allowing some individuals to keep their plans , temporarily			0
but while the president expressed regret for having engaged in what @entity86 dubbed the " @entity88 , " he has not once apologized for the arrogant and patronizing attitude underpinning the entire controversy — one in which the president believes that he and his bureaucrats know better than everyday @entity21			1
sadly , this attitude does not just pervade @entity96 liberals ; it 's also right at home in my state of @entity100			0
in 2012 , the executive director of a state teachers ' union claimed that school scholarship programs would n't work , because low - income parents could not make decisions about their children 's education , saying they " have no clue			0
" these comments perfectly illustrate the left 's double standards			0
both president @entity30 and @entity112 — the attorney general who filed suit to impede our scholarship program but lied to @entity117 about it last month — choose to educate their children at elite @entity96 schools costing more than $ 35,000 per year			1
but if @entity21 of more modest financial means — whose annual income may be dwarfed by the tuition fees president @entity30 easily pays for his daughters — want their children to escape failing schools , or buy the health plan they want , the left exclaims : " oh no , we ca n't let you do that			1
" that 's exactly how @entity131 reacted to the health care alternative i recently endorsed			0
responding to the plan 's new incentives giving individuals more choices and insurance options , its analysts claimed that " most people are not informed well enough ( sic ) to make the right choices about which plan to buy , what it covers , what it will cost them , and especially how to decide what care to seek			0
" that 's what @entity131 considers an " epic fail : " allowing the " ignorant " @entity21 people to pick their own health care options			2
i will readily admit that we do need to improve the transparency of health care cost and quality information			0
and of course in an emergency no patient in cardiac arrest will be able to " comparison shop " for treatment options			0
but if @entity131 , president @entity30 , or anyone else on the left thinks the @entity21 people are too dumb to pick a school or health plan , they should say so publicly — and in so many words			1
@entity171 famously quipped that the nine most terrifying words in the @entity174 language are " i 'm from the government , and i 'm here to help			0
" i believe the best way to help is to empower citizens , trusting them to make good choices , not creating nanny states to " protect " individuals from themselves			0
as a matter of policy , giving @entity21 choice in schools and health care is simply the right thing to do			2
and as a matter of politics , insulting voters ' intelligence is just plain stupid			2
join us on @entity193 / @entity192 .			0

@entity195 once warned the @entity7 to stop being the " stupid party "
he says @entity12 now need to heed that *advice*
he points to changes in the *rollout* of @entity32 and delays in the individual mandate
he *argues* the @entity30 administration thinks @entity21 are " delusional " or " dimwits "
