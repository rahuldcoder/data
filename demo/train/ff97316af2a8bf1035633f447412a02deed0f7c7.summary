-- two years ago , @entity1 , the head of @entity3 's @entity2 , decided to find out what happened when city residents disposed of trash			1
his team recruited 500 volunteers in @entity9 to put sensor tags on items they were throwing away , and the researchers tracked the travels of the trash			1
of the 3,000 discarded items that were tracked and visualized in the research , some traveled considerable distances , with one , an ink cartridge , being shipped to the @entity20 before winding up in @entity21 , a journey of nearly 4,000 miles			1
" when you have all these traces of trash moving around , " said @entity1 , " you can ask yourself how can we make the system more efficient			2
then we can make better decisions			0
and perhaps we will not throw away the plastic bottles that go every day to the dump			0
" @entity1 , a civil engineer and architect , spoke at the @entity33 conference in @entity34 , @entity21 , in march and was interviewed by @entity0			0
watch @entity1 's @entity35 " cities are 2 % of the earth 's crust but they are 50 % of the world 's population , " and consume 75 % of the world 's energy , he said			1
as computer technology has advanced in past decades , cities have been transformed into digital networks that can be analyzed and activated to improve urban living , @entity1 said			2
@entity1 sees technology as a two - way street			0
you can use it to make sense of the physical world , digitizing what 's out there as he did with the @entity9 trash project			1
but you can also take something that 's purely digital and make it real in the physical world			0
among other projects he has worked on was the " @entity63 , " a building built for an expo in @entity66 , @entity67 , with exterior and internal walls produced by flowing water controlled by a computerized system			0
when you approach the building to enter , sensors stop the water flow to create a doorway you can step through without getting wet .			2

@entity1 heads @entity3 's @entity2
he used sensors to track flow of trash discarded by volunteers in @entity9
he found that some items travel thousands of miles
@entity1 's projects use computers to create new urban *structures*
