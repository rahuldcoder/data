-- @entity2 house speaker @entity1 has invited gunmakers such as @entity4 to relocate to his state from others including @entity7 , where firearms have been a controversial issue since a school shooting there last december left 20 students and six adults dead			1
the gun industry in @entity7 is being attacked and " demonized " because of national politics , @entity1 said in a letter this week to @entity17 ceo @entity16			1
he also invited gunmaker @entity18 of @entity20 to relocate to @entity2			0
@entity1 , a @entity21 , said firearm manufacturers are " under attack in @entity25 states			0
" " in our state , you will not be criticized for providing goods to the law - abiding citizens who enjoy hunting , shooting or who just want the peace of mind that comes with the constitutional right to protect their families , " @entity1 wrote to @entity4 on thursday			0
" we welcome you with open arms ! " he said			0
in an interview with @entity0 affiliate @entity43 , @entity1 said having gunmakers move their operations to @entity2 is a " natural match , " saying the industry " meshes well " in a state with citizens who " love to hunt , ... love to shoot , ( and ) people enjoy the peace of mind that comes from knowing they have the right to defend themselves			1
" @entity56 sen. @entity55 , a @entity7 @entity57 , said @entity1 sent letters to three gunmakers in his state and called @entity1 's proposal " preposterous			1
" @entity7 residents support the @entity63 and responsible gun ownership , " far from demonizing firearms products made here , " @entity55 said in a statement			2
" this preposterous pitch to companies with long , successful histories in our state shows the need for national standards and statutes to reduce gun violence , " the senator said			1
" competition among states for less protective laws is a race to the bottom that should be avoided			0
the poison of illegal gun trafficking respects no state boundaries and threatens to cause more horrific tragedies like @entity86 and the 1,900 gun violence deaths that have occurred since then			0
" @entity86 is the name of the @entity7 town where last december 's mass shooting occurred , at @entity91			2
representatives for @entity4 and @entity18 could n't be reached immediately for comment friday			0
@entity94 , interim @entity95 from @entity96 , called @entity1 's attempt " gimmicky " and predicted it would n't work to draw @entity99 from its base in @entity101 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity102			1
that sentiment was echoed by @entity101 's mayor , who said his city 's and @entity96 ' skilled and educated workforce measured up favorably against those in @entity2 and other states			1
" @entity99 is not going anywhere , " mayor @entity109 told @entity102 , adding he still stands by his support for " sensible gun control			2
" " they 've been a vital and good corporate citizen here in the city of @entity101			0
