@entity0 -- @entity4 , the son of media magnate @entity5 , stepped down as the chairman of @entity8 on tuesday , the @entity3 satellite broadcaster announced			1
he has been hammered by accusations that @entity11 's @entity3 sunday tabloid the @entity10 systematically eavesdropped illegally on crime victims , politicians , celebrities and veterans in search of stories			1
@entity5 , 39 , has consistently denied knowing about the scale of phone hacking at the paper , which he ordered shut down last summer in the face of the scandal			2
he referred to it in his resignation , saying : " i am determined that the interests of @entity8 should not be undermined by matters outside the scope of this company			2
" he made clear he was trying to shield the satellite broadcaster from fallout from the newspaper scandal , saying : " i believe that my resignation will help to ensure that there is no false conflation with events at a separate organization			1
" @entity5 will stay on as a non-executive director of @entity8			1
@entity8 shares in @entity0 fell about half a percentage point on the news of his resignation , and the @entity41 's @entity11 fell about the same at the open in @entity43			1
the resignation comes on the heels of his stepping down from @entity11 's @entity3 newspaper publishing companies in the wake of scandals over the past year			2
when he quit as chairman of @entity52 in february , the company said it was to focus on @entity11 's pay television services			0

dozens of people have been arrested but no one has been charged			0
two parliamentary committees and an independent inquiry led by a judge are also probing the scandal			1
the scandal broke as @entity11 moved to expand its ownership of @entity8 last summer -- a plan it shelved as politicians and the public expressed outrage about the hacking of the voice mail of a missing teenage girl who later turned out to have been murdered			1
@entity4 has been seen as a potential heir to his father 's media empire			0
he has twice been called to testify before lawmakers in @entity0 about what he knew of misconduct by staff at @entity52			0
in a letter to parliament 's @entity85 last month , @entity4 said he could have asked more questions of senior officers at the firm , but rejected the suggestion that his resignation as chief executive reflected unrevealed knowledge relating to the scandal			2
" i take my share of responsibility for not uncovering wrongdoing earlier , " he wrote in the letter , dated march 12 and published by lawmakers			0
a @entity11 board meeting is scheduled for later tuesday			0
