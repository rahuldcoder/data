-- remember the good ol ' days , circa mid-naughts , when most people 's phones just alerted them of incoming calls and the occasional text message ? after a two - second peek , you knew that you were not in desperate demand , and you were free to slip your cell back into your pocket or purse ( or cell phone holster , if you were a huge geek )			1
you 'd then go back to standing in line , taking in a raucous concert or attending your grandma bunny 's funeral			1
now we 're more stupidly available , and a phone check involves , at minimum , viewing your e-mails , scanning @entity22 mentions , perusing blog comments and stalking that dude 's @entity25 wall			1
even if there 's nothing remarkable in any digi - venue , we keep tapping away -- reading the latest headlines , checking the weather ( often , bafflingly , while outside or near a window ) or ordering the most darling collectible @entity33 set from @entity34			1
you know , the usual			0
last year , a study even hinted that fresh bits of info may hook into the brain 's reward system , shedding light on how whipping out your phone is analogous to that whiskey - and - taco bender you went on last weekend			1
( it just hurts so gooooood			0
) the problem , of course , is that constantly perusing your phone is freaking rude -- a clear signal that your reception is more important than anything going on in the here and now			1
get this : 10 percent of people 24 and younger think it 's ok to text during sex , according to consumer electronics shopping and review site @entity60			2
that brings a whole meaning to the term multitasking			0
but unless you 're among that add - addled 10 percent , there 's hope for you yet			1
may we suggest holsterin ' the old communication cannon during the following situations : at a restaurant putting your phone screen - up on the table is like ordering dessert -- one person does it and everyone else follows suit			1
never mind that phones do not belong amidst tableware			1
as soon as a text pops up or a call comes through , everyone else at the table is trapped in conversational limbo while you have your own digital @entity86			2
if you must remain imminently reachable , simply make a big show out of it : " i 'm so sorry to have to keep my phone out			2
@entity90 is supposed to get here soon , and i do n't want to miss her			0
" the others will get the point			0
either that , or they 'll stick you with the bill			2
do n't worry , you 'll likely be too distracted by @entity97 to notice			0
on the sidewalk it 's one thing to walk and talk with your phone glued to your ear			1
research finds that you 're more likely to get run over while yakking , but hey , that 's a risk you take			1
however , tucking your chin to your chest and staggering along whilst reviewing your @entity109 updates or checking the @entity111 list for your " @entity113 " viewing party is both stupid ( cars ! ) and obnoxious			0
it 's all about spatial awareness : those who walk - n - surf tend to weave to and fro , making them impossible to pass on crowded or skinny sidewalks			2
@entity121 yourself out of the current and against a wall , finish your phone time and pocket your cell before re-entering the deadened , zombified stream of pedestrian humanity			2
special request to those of you who live in subway - arteried cities : i know you 're super eager to breach fresh air and burst into the service zone , but for heaven 's sake , wait until you 've crested the stairs to turn your attention to your mobile			1
your slow climb is pissing off scads of already addled public transportation users			0
one day they will push you to your death , and all those shuffling aforementioned zombies will likely trample you under their distracted soles			0
when cool stuff is happening @entity149 aside , here 's the big danger with packing every spare moment with a cybercheck : eventually , idle but perfectly interesting moments ( sitting on a park bench , people - watching at a caf√© ) become excuses to busy yourself with your touch screen			1
remember that iconic @entity160 cover from last @entity161 ? clever , sure			0
@entity163 , prepare to be climbed : challenge yourself to go a week without using your data plan			2
pretend you 're on vacation overseas and ca n't afford the rate			0
turn off @entity167 and all the other emphatic verbs that bring inane @entity25 updates and new e-mails to your attention like a cat proudly dropping an especially fresh rodent at your feet			0
stick to phone calls and texting and check everything else exclusively from a computer			1
you 'll see passersby , not pixels , when you 're riding in a car ; squirrels , not a screen , when you 're waiting outside to meet a friend			0
and you 'll make the liberating ( albeit depressing ) discovery that when you fire up your e-mail again , the world has continued to swivel without your immediate viewage of e-coupons from @entity190 and that cat video from @entity192			0
those are best dealt with when you 're at your desk and supposedly working anyway .			0
