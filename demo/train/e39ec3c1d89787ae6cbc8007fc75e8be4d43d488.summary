-- @entity2 guard @entity1 broke down in tears at a press conference when asked what a new shoe contract worth $ 250 million meant to him			0
his responses on camera and on @entity9 were about his feelings on the teachers strike in @entity12			1
he had a $ 250 million shoe contract , but the youth of his hometown of @entity12 were on the mind of this young man			1
it was obvious that @entity19 understood the political aspect , but he focused on the human aspect -- he realizes that he could have easily been one of the kids killed in the senseless violence that has ravaged his native city , he realizes he is fortunate -- and if you were a witness to the interview , you would agree that the last thing on his mind was a tax break			0
also recently , @entity31 player @entity30 's took a public stand on @entity34 rights			1
it prompted @entity36 , a state delegate from @entity37 , to ask that @entity31 owner @entity45 , " take the necessary action , as a @entity40 owner , to inhibit such expressions from your employees and that he be ordered to cease and desist such injurious actions			0
i know of no other @entity40 player who has done what mr. @entity30 is doing			0
" it was a perfect example of a critic using the " shut up and play " motto			0
@entity52 's stance is one that has been taken up by other @entity40 players , such as @entity55 , but maybe the best response came from fellow @entity34 supporter @entity58 punter @entity57 , who wrote possibly one of the best political statements ever made by an athlete to @entity36			1
@entity57 's second point in the letter reads : " you wrote , ' many of your fans are opposed to such a view and feel it has no place in a sport that is strictly for pride , entertainment and excitement			1
' @entity75 -- ing -- balls			0
did you seriously just say that , as someone who is , according to your @entity80 page , ' deeply involved in government task forces on the legacy of slavery in @entity84 ? ' have you not heard of @entity85 ? @entity86 ? as recently as 1962 the @entity40 still had segregation , which was only done away with by brave athletes and coaches daring to speak their mind and do the right thing , and you 're going to say that political views have ' no place in a sport ' ? i ca n't even begin to fathom the cognitive dissonance that must be coursing through your rapidly addled mind right now ; the mental gymnastics your brain has to tortuously contort itself through to make such a preposterous statement are surely worthy of an @entity102 ( the @entity104 judge gives you a 10 for ' beautiful oppressionism ' )			1
" social media allows for a constant , entertaining and unfiltered window into users ' thoughts			1
it has become an arena where the convictions , thoughts , feelings and politics of some of our favorite athletes take the forefront			2
@entity120 and @entity9 have revolutionized how we communicate with sports icons , because anyone with an ip address can express themselves any way they choose from anywhere in the world			0
social media helped bring fans closer to athletes and to feel a part of the game , with real - time responses in some instances			1
yet something unexpected has happened			0
fans are getting a direct line into some of the personal issues and opinions that historically were heavily guarded			1
in the past , agents and marketing personnel felt if athletes gave their opinions on hot topics , it could destroy huge endorsement contracts			2
this complicated view of sports and politics has historically led to a series of great moments , as well as missed opportunities , depending on your political point of view			2
it was the tempestuous climate of the 1960s that displayed the most famous political stances from athletes			2
moments of protest were thrust into the living rooms of a worldwide audience : @entity163 was @entity165 's historic stand against the draft process and the @entity167			2
then came the 1968 @entity168 in which @entity169 and @entity170 raised their fists to the sky in protest , with @entity174 wearing an @entity176 badge to support them			0
the media attention helped propel what can be considered one of the most iconic images and moments in sports into a historic notion of free speech			2
while those athletes ' political stances are admired and even idolized today , they faced major repercussions back then			2
@entity165 was stripped of his title and boxing license , while @entity170 and @entity169 were forced to relinquish their medals			0
@entity194 native @entity193 , who won a gold medal in those @entity196 as a member of the 4x100 relay , witnessed that moment firsthand			0
" athletes do n't do enough when it comes to politics , " @entity193 said			2
the statement that was made that day in @entity203 was not intended to bring attention to the fight for freedom and equality for black people , but for all people			0
there will always be someone on the other side of the issue			0
for our athletes , the backlash can be debilitating to their career , finances or fan base			1
social media and its unfiltered commentary has in some ways become a pr agent 's worst nightmare			1
that intimate window into athletes ' thoughts has no buffer and is putting the power into their hands			2
@entity231 has urged some of the world 's most notable athletes , like @entity235 and @entity236 , to take a stand on social and political issues for years			1
@entity231 questioned their need to protect their image over standing up for what was right			0
@entity242 , in an august commentary for @entity244 , discussed the evolution of sports and politics as it relates to @entity235			0
during @entity235 's early playing days he refused to support @entity249 candidate @entity248 , who was running for a @entity251 seat			1
@entity235 famously declared , " republicans buy sneakers , too			0
" at that time there would likely have been backlash against @entity235 , who as a retiree recently hosted a private fundraising dinner for president @entity258			2
these days , famous athletes are open with their views without any fear of backlash			1
@entity262 appeared in an anti-abortion commercial with his mother and is very active on @entity9 discussing his faith			0
in the spring , the @entity267 players , in a show of solidarity during the @entity270 shooting investigation , united for a hooded photo honoring @entity270 's memory			0
the sports world is evolving much the way the world is adjusting to social media and new ideas			1
this new age of athletes are willing to use their social status to influence the political and cultural landscape			1
change is constant , but growth is optional			0
social media has united athletes and fans in a way that not many other avenues can			1
you may not always agree with the stance of your favorite athlete , but at least these days they have an opinion , and it seems they are willing to let the world know .			1

pro athletes use social media to discuss the *election* , @entity12 teachers strike , gay rights
historically , fans *rarely* heard about an athlete 's personal stance on the issues
@entity311 : these days , athletes are open with their views without fear of backlash
