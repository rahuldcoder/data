-- he is someone you might want for a son			0
except you ca n't adopt him			0
he 's somebody else 's favorite son			2
@entity5 , raised to be humble , groomed to be great , is @entity6 the place that gave birth to a bouncing basketball boy is thrilled that the kid , all grown up now , is still living at home			1
as the human blur of a point guard for the @entity15 , @entity12 could become the team 's first player since @entity18 to win the @entity20 's @entity19			1
and while @entity12 may never reach the level of worship enjoyed by @entity18 , there 's a certain love for @entity12 that @entity18 never knew			1
a love only a parent can give			0
you see it nightly at the @entity29 , feel it in warm applause , sense it in a basketball season that 's going @entity6 's way			1
@entity12 justifies all the fuss with performances that manage to entertain fans and win games , a combination that makes him worth the price of admission alone			1
really , what 's not to love about a player with the speed necessary to reach the rim , and an improved outside shot that makes him deadly from 20 feet , and an air of confidence that has him and the city thinking anything 's possible ? here on the eve of the playoffs , where the @entity15 will enter as the no. 1 seed in the @entity57 , he 's pumping 25 points a game , good for seventh in the league , which would be fine if that was the whole story			1
he was born in one of the armpits of @entity6 , a ' hood that would make @entity67 flinch , a place where kids like @entity12 do n't need a gps to find trouble			1
a quick pair of fists come in handy where @entity12 comes from , but best we can tell , all he ever beat up were stereotypes			1
let 's just say he does n't carry himself in a way society has come to expect from young men raised on @entity82			2
@entity83 and me - me attitude ? oh , sure , he has one			2
like any star who makes grown - ups slobber all over themselves , @entity12 brings a list of demands			1
a list the size of a postage stamp			0
and there 's only one item on it : he asks for access to the @entity15 ' practice facility at all hours because sometimes the urge to work on his game dawns upon him at the break of dawn			1
after spending an entire day at his youth camp -- and you do n't know the definition of " exhaustion " until you 've worked with a few hundred boys with short attention spans -- @entity12 recuperated by shooting jumpers for a few hours at the team gym			1
and the season was still months away			0
" i just want to win games and be true to my family , team , my teammates and the city , " @entity12 said			1
" they 've all given me so much			0
" just recently , on a day off , he drove himself to his old high school to watch a few buddies in a pickup game			2
yeah , that sounds exactly like what a famous 22 - year - old athlete would do for a thrill in a city like @entity6			1
" he had a great time , " said @entity128 , @entity12 's old coach and still the current coach at @entity130			1
" it was a big deal to the kids at school but no big deal to him			0
he 's just that way			2
" @entity12 will deliver a magnificent game , for example his 39 - point effort against @entity143 just last sunday , and then rave about a screen set for him by a teammate			1
at the @entity152 in @entity153 two months ago , when @entity147 and a smoke machine introduced each player in a @entity151 - style opening , @entity12 gently waved and smiled slightly and quickly walked off the stage , looking somewhat embarrassed by the attention			1
in a sports era where players love to pull their jersey to celebrate a big basket , @entity12 pulls no stunts			1
no chest - thumping or fist - pumping or shimmy - shaking			2
he does not teach anyone how to @entity163			0
he leaves the screaming to the fans			0
" he 's just a grounded guy , " said @entity166 , the @entity15 ' executive vice president of basketball operations			1
" the things that are most important to him are family and basketball			0
" if it seems @entity12 was made for this , that 's because he was			1
when he began to outplay high school kids at age 7 , the process began in earnest			0
his mother , a single parent , put her three oldest sons in charge of @entity5			0
they formed a brotherly shield around him , blocking out all unwanted intrusions , especially the aggressive reptiles known as street agents			0
at least one brother shadowed him everywhere : to and from school , games , practices and parties			0
they did n't want @entity5 to fall through the cracks , to end up another sad statistic			0
or to become an innocent victim like @entity198 , the famed @entity6 schoolboy who was gunned down decades ago before he graduated from @entity130			1
" the manner in which he was raised while he was little gave him a great perspective on life , " @entity166 said			0
@entity5 chose to wear @entity198 's number , 25 , and continue the slain player 's journey as a tribute			2
with his brothers ' help , he stayed straight and avoided the most vicious double - team a young player can face : temptation and trouble			2
perhaps he was protected too much ; his @entity216 score was voided over suspicions that someone took it for him			0
@entity12 has always denied this , but after taking @entity222 to the @entity224 title game as a freshman , that season was wiped from the books by the @entity224			1
@entity12 went to the @entity20 where , fate had it , the hometown @entity15 awaited			1
" i was happy , because there was only one team i really wanted to play for , " @entity12 said			1
not many local players get the chance to start their career , or spend most of it , with the home team			2
some of that is merely by chance ; @entity12 just happened to be the best player in college basketball and the @entity15 owned the no. 1 pick in the draft			1
but some teams are allergic to drafting or trading for locals because they worry about the demands placed on the player : old blood - sucking friends and pressure to play well			1
when these players fail spectacularly the way @entity252 did in @entity253 with the @entity254 , they crumble twice as hard			0
they 're not locals anymore ; they 're home - groan			1
" a lot of these guys did n't grow up in the best areas , and did n't have the best influences in their lives , " @entity166 said			2
" sometimes you bring them back to that element , where people are trying to get something from them			0
once we delved into @entity5 and his family , if there was going to be an element , it would be handled			0
his brothers are still around and watching very carefully what 's going on			2
" they 're not the only ones			0
we 're all watching what 's going on : the early evolution of a star who 's taking his status in stride			2
the most recent example of a local who became a hometown star was @entity284 spending seven seasons with the @entity286 ( @entity284 's from @entity287 , not @entity286 , but close enough )			2
and we saw how that turned out			0
@entity284 is welcome in @entity286 like a @entity290 trophy			0
" one of the things that impresses me about @entity5 is he feels the responsibility to be the best , and to carry himself as a great player would , " @entity166 said			0
" he understands the position he 's in and what 's expected of him from his coaches , teammates , the organization and the community			0
there are some young players in this league who understand the right way to play the game , who are professionals and who are fantastic role models for this league			2
he 's one of them			0
" before each home game , when the @entity15 ' starting lineup is introduced , the players are announced by position and where they attended college			1
@entity12 is also announced as being from @entity6			1
" there 's a sense of pride involved , and it teaches something to young people around here , " @entity166 explained			2
" it 's a story of a guy who did n't grow up with much			0
with the help of his family , he rose from grim circumstances			0
that 's something people here need to look at , and also emulate			0

@entity334 : @entity6 native rose was born in " a ' hood that would make @entity67 flinch "
@entity12 remains humble : he still lives at home and remains involved in a local youth camp
@entity12 's only " demand " : 24 - hour access to @entity15 ' practice facility so he can work on his game
@entity20 often avoids drafting locals , citing " old blood - sucking friends and pressure to play well "
