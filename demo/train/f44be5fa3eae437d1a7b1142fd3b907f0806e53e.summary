the @entity1 @entity0 says it is firing four senior officials after allegations and investigations of long wait times and other problems at @entity8 medical facilities			1
directors at the @entity8 health care systems in @entity13 , central @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity16 , are in the process of being fired , and the @entity8 's deputy chief procurement director in @entity10 is also in line to lose her job , the @entity8 headquarters in @entity10 said in recent news releases			1
the @entity13 move comes almost two years after @entity23 first reported about an outbreak of @entity26 ' disease at a @entity27 there			2
part of @entity23 's 2012 investigation found 21 patients at the @entity8 who were diagnosed with the disease , five of whom died within 30 days of being diagnosed			1
@entity8 officials knew about problems and dangers with the medical center 's water system , but did not disclose that information for almost a year			2
in a followup investigation , the @entity8 's inspector general found that the @entity8 's staff did not take the proper steps to prevent the spread of @entity46 , such as flushing water faucets , and that pneumonia patients were not properly tested for the disease			1
the director of that hospital , @entity49 , has been on administrative leave since june and is now in the process of being fired for " conduct unbecoming a senior executive			2
" @entity49 has the right to appeal that decision before the firing is complete , a @entity8 representative said			0
" @entity8 will actively and aggressively pursue disciplinary action on those who violate our values			0
there should be no doubt that when we discover evidence of wrongdoing , we will hold employees accountable , " @entity8 deputy secretary @entity61 said			2
the firings are a direct result of wrongdoing found by the @entity8 's @entity75 and the @entity76 , including significant delays and wait times of veterans , manipulation of appointment data , " neglect of duty , " inappropriate handling of @entity8 contracts and misconduct at @entity8 facilities			1
@entity8 inspector general admits wait times contributed to vets ' deaths the firings also follow a yearlong investigation by @entity23 that found numerous instances of delays in care and , at times , deaths of @entity1 veterans at @entity8 facilities across the country			1
the reports sparked a national outrage , which led to the resignation of va secretary @entity99 and prompted numerous @entity101 and @entity102 hearings			0
that resulted in a new law revising the @entity8 health care system designed to help veterans get faster care			2
the new law , which was passed this summer and signed by president @entity108 , also gives va secretary @entity109 more authority to quickly fire top executives			0
the @entity8 also announced that @entity112 , the director of the va medical center in @entity15 , is in the process of being fired after the @entity8 's inspector general revealed that the hospital 's staff closed out more than 1,500 patient appointments to hide long wait times in order to meet goals set by @entity8 headquarters			1
@entity123 announced he was retiring four days before his removal was made public			0
@entity1 rep. @entity125 , @entity126 and chairman of the @entity128 , who led the charge for more accountability at the @entity8 and whose committee has been instrumental in pressing for details of wrongdoing at @entity8 facilities , said tuesday that he is not certain the new process of firings is enough			1
" bragging about the proposed removal of someone who has already announced his retirement can only be described as disingenuous			0
department leaders must not tolerate this instance of what appears to be blatant deceit			0
such semantic sleights of hand are insulting to the families struck by the @entity8 scandal and only do more harm to the department 's badly damaged credibility , " he said in a statement to @entity23			1
" @entity153 acted with near unanimity to give the @entity8 secretary greater authority to actually fire failing executives , not just propose removing them			0
because this is merely a proposed action , we need to reserve judgment on whether appropriate accountability has been achieved			0
" in a statement tuesday , @entity8 deputy secretary @entity61 said , " recently , @entity8 announced disciplinary actions against four individuals , consistent with the law that @entity153 just passed			2
if @entity153 wants @entity8 to implement a different law , it should pass one			0
until then , @entity8 will use the authority it has been given fully and responsibly to protect the health , safety , and well - being of our nation 's veterans while at the same time ensuring that disciplinary actions are based on the best possible evidence from entities such as the inspector general , the @entity179 , and the @entity180 , so that these actions stick			2
" part of @entity23 's investigation brought national attention to a secret waiting list at the @entity186 and to charges by whistleblowers that veterans had died there , waiting for care			1
all of the charges have been substantiated by the inspector general			0
just after those revelations , three top officials at that @entity8 facility , including director @entity195 , were placed on administrative leave and are in the process of being fired			1
@entity195 is still being paid			0
the @entity8 is also in the process of firing @entity200 , the director of the @entity201 , where the inspector general confirmed this year that a lack of trained appointment schedulers contributed to some delays and dysfunction in the hospital 's podiatry clinic			1
a 2012 inspector general report also found that @entity211 patients did not receive timely colorectal cancer screenings			0
@entity8 audits this year showed that more than 6,000 patients waited at least 90 days for care at this medical center and that some schedulers there were instructed to hide long wait times			2
the fourth @entity8 employee being fired , deputy chief procurement officer @entity219 , inappropriately influenced the awarding of @entity8 contracts to a private company and interfered with an investigation into the matter , according to a report by the @entity8 's inspector general			1
@entity219 reportedly gave preferential treatment to the company @entity229 , an online marketplace , and had an affair with a former employee of several government agencies who had ties to the company			0
the @entity8 's inspector general stated that @entity219 " improperly disclosed non-public va information to unauthorized persons , misused her position and @entity8 resources for private gain , and engaged in a prohibited personnel practice			1
" on tuesday , the @entity8 also announced that @entity243 , the director of the @entity244 in @entity245 , will retire at the end of this month , after 40 years at the @entity8 , including two years as director of the hospital			0
@entity249 has , like other @entity8 officials , been at the center of controversy in recent months			0
at @entity255 , like other @entity8 hospitals , @entity23 and other media outlets reported allegations made by whistle blowers about veterans being kept on secret wait lists , and hiding of actual delays in care , while administrators received bonuses .			1

officials in @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity16 are in the process of being fired
@entity8 's deputy chief procurement director in @entity10 is also in line to lose her job
