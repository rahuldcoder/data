as security forces ran out , militants overran @entity3 's second - largest city on tuesday -- a stunning collapse that heightened questions about prime minister @entity7 's ability to hold onto not only @entity8 , but his entire country			1
militants seized @entity8 's airport , tv stations , the governor 's office and other parts , if not all , of the northern @entity3 city			1
" i only ... saw armed people , but not @entity3 military , " said resident @entity16 of his drive through @entity8 on tuesday			1
" there was no presence of any government forces on the streets , the majority of their posts destroyed and manned by ( @entity29 militants )			1
" other witnesses painted similar scenes , of buildings and boulevards manned not by @entity3 soldiers or police but rather by men they say are members of the extremist group the @entity38 , an @entity40 splinter group also known by its acronym @entity38			1
@entity8 was n't the only place in the country beset by violence tuesday , including some focused closer to the capital of @entity46			2
still , what 's happening in this northern @entity3 city is the most serious , given its size , the bloodshed 's scope and the brewing humanitarian situation tied to it			2
the numerous reports of police and soldiers running from their posts in @entity8 raised the prospect that the @entity3 government did not either have the will or resources to win this and other fights			1
in perhaps a sign of just how serious the threat is , @entity7 took to the airwaves to urge all men to volunteer to fight , promising to provide weapons and equipment			1
the prime minister also urged parliament to declare a state of emergency as part of an effort " to confront this ferocious attack that harms all @entity3			1
" " we will not allow for the remainder of the ... province and the city to fall , " he said in a live speech broadcast on @entity3 state tv			2
already , hundreds in @entity8 have been killed since the fighting began five days ago			2
tens of thousands more have fled in vehicles and on foot , some of them carrying only what they could in plastic bags			0
this rush has contributed to bottlenecks at checkpoints as people tried to get to safety in nearby @entity94			0
within @entity8 , militants managed to take control of security checkpoints , military bases and a prison , where they freed up to 1,000 prisoners , authorities said			2
they did so after apparently overrunning @entity3 security forces , whose bodies -- some of them mutilated -- littered the streets , a @entity107 journalist on the ground in @entity8 reported			1
some police took off their uniforms , dropped their weapons and ran , according to the journalist			0
a journalist with @entity114 , who was fleeing the city with his family , reported security forces had abandoned vehicles and a police station was set on fire			0
" we ca n't beat them			0
they are well - trained in street fighting , and we 're not , " one officer , whose identity was withheld , told @entity107			0
" we need a whole army to drive them out of @entity8			0
" fighting elsewhere around @entity3 political and sectarian violence have wracked @entity3 for months , often pitting minority @entity130 against majority @entity131 , who came to dominate the government after @entity3 leader @entity134 was overthrown in 2003			1
tensions are fueled by widespread discontent among the @entity130 , who say they are marginalized by the @entity131 - led government and unfairly targeted by heavy - handed security tactics			2
militants also believed to be from @entity38 have also taken control of two villages in @entity144 province and one in @entity147 province , @entity3 police officials told @entity148 on tuesday			1
the move into @entity147 province -- the capital of which , @entity151 , was @entity134 's hometown -- shows how close the major fighting is getting to @entity46			0
@entity153 posted on @entity154 purportedly shows all jail cells in a police station in @entity157 in the province abandoned , though @entity148 could confirm the authenticity of the footage			0
on tuesday night , @entity3 security forces were clashing with dozens of gunmen attempting to storm the @entity165 oil refinery about 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) north of the capital , police officials in @entity151 said			2
closer to @entity46 , at least 31 people were killed and 28 others injured in a series of roadside bombs detonated at a cemetery on the outskirts of the central city of @entity174 , according to police officials			0
two residents of @entity177 , which is in @entity130 - dominated @entity179 province and controlled by militants , say a majority of government forces have pulled back from that city to focus on securing @entity46 's perimeter			1
this violence is significant but hardly new in @entity3 , which has been beset by instability for years			0
that includes bloodshed in the years immediately after @entity134 's capture over a decade ago			0
still , one difference between then and now is the @entity3 government had help from @entity193 - led forces at that time			1
now , after a brief lull , the unrest has picked up			0
the @entity196 has said 2013 was the deadliest year in @entity3 since 2008 , with more than 8,800 people killed -- most of them civilians			2
nearly 500,000 people are estimated to have been displaced this year in fighting , primarily in @entity179 province			0
radical islamists on the move while sectarian strife is largely to blame , there 's no doubt that radical @entity202 increasingly flexed their muscles and expanded their reach in recent months			0
formost among them is @entity38 , which has wrested control of @entity3 cities like @entity177 and parts of @entity214 as well as of @entity216 towns just over the border			1
it has done so by exploiting the weakness of @entity3 's central @entity131 - dominated government , says @entity148 's @entity220 , as it has done in @entity8			1
" it is considered too radical even for @entity40 and , in the past months , has withstood and emerged from a jihadist backlash from its erstwhile radical @entity29 allies in @entity216 's civil war , " @entity220 said			0
" @entity8 ... has made them the single most dangerous , destabilizing radical group in the region , something @entity7 's government seems ill - equipped to deal with			2
" the fall of @entity8 -- a predominantly @entity130 city with a population of about 1.6 million -- would be a blow to the central government , which is already struggling to contain an insurgency in central @entity179 province			2
@entity8 , about 560 kilometers ( 350 miles ) northwest of @entity46 , was once called the last stronghold of @entity40 in @entity3 by the @entity193 military , and at the height of the @entity3 war , it was considered one of the main entry points for foreign fighters coming into the country by way of @entity216			1
the security forces , particularly police , have not always been trusted in @entity8			2
in 2004 , thousands of police officers fled their posts amid the @entity130 insurgency , leaving @entity193 and @entity252 forces to fight to keep control of the city			0
this time around , @entity255 saw no sign of government authorities in his @entity8 neighborhood , prompting him to flee along with his wife , three children and other family members			1
" gunmen are everywhere in my neighborhood , " he told @entity148 by telephone			0
" ... where are the @entity3 army and police ? where are the politicians that we trusted and voted for ? " by late tuesday , @entity274 and his family were among hundreds waiting at a checkpoint on the road between @entity8 and the @entity94 , the capital of @entity3 's semiautonomous @entity252 region			1
@entity281 decided to drive out of @entity8 at dawn with her three daughters and two sons			0
she was n't taking any chances , especially knowing how gunmen killed her husband outside of a mosque in @entity8 a few years ago			0
" i left everything behind , and i do n't know how long it will take to return back to our home , " she said			0
@entity293 , the @entity8 resident , said that while government forces were absent , @entity38 fighters seemed to be in control			1
members of the group even urged mobs trying to flee toward @entity252 to go back home , he said			0
" ' we will not hurt anyone , ' " @entity16 said of what @entity38 members were saying			1
" ' we have liberated the city of @entity8 from @entity7 forces ... we are running this city , and tomorrow all ( businesses ) need to be reopened			1
' grisly scene in @entity3 : ' see these children ? ' speaker points finger at security forces @entity313 has become part of the story in @entity8 as well , with the @entity316 reporting fighting near its consulate in the city and noting reports that militants abducted 28 @entity313 truck drivers hauling fuel			1
the drivers were en route from @entity325 , @entity313 , to an electrical plant outside of @entity8			0
according to the @entity316 , when the drivers arrived at the plant , @entity38 fighters grabbed them			0
earlier , the speaker of @entity3 's parliament said that a " foreign invasion " of the country was under way by " terrorist groups " and that the northern province of @entity333 , of which @entity8 is the capital , was under " total occupation			1
" speaking at a news conference in @entity46 , @entity337 appeared to point the finger at the central government , accusing security forces of abandoning @entity8 when the fighting began			2
@entity343 said security forces " abandoned their weapons , their tanks and their bases and left them to terrorist groups , even @entity8 airport			2
" he also said gunmen had taken over ammunition storage facilities			0
the speaker , whose brother @entity354 is the governor of @entity333 province , said the central government had been warned over the past few weeks that militant groups were gathering but had taken no preventive action			0
" it will not stop at the borders of @entity333 but will reach all of @entity3 , " he said			0
also criticizing the central government was @entity362 , the prime minister of @entity3 's semi-autonomous @entity252 region , who blamed security forces for allowing militants to take control of portions of @entity8			1
" over the last two days , we tried extremely hard to establish cooperation with the @entity3 security forces in order to protect the city of @entity8			1
tragically , @entity46 adopted a position which has prevented the establishment of this cooperation , " he said in a written statement			0
while @entity3 's defense and interior ministries did n't release statements tuesday about the situation in @entity8 , the country 's most influential @entity131 cleric expressed support for their efforts			1
" religious authority stresses that @entity3 government and other political leaders need to unify and strengthen its efforts to stand up to the terrorists and to provide protection to citizens , " said @entity384			1
one move too far : how @entity7 overreached in @entity179 thousands flee intense @entity177 shelling opinion : why @entity3 elections ca n't fix chaos			2

witness says @entity38 members told people to return to " liberated " @entity8
top @entity131 cleric urges national unity " to stand up to the terrorists "
residents : most government forces have pulled back from @entity177
@entity3 prime minister calls on men to volunteer to fight , promising to provide weapons
