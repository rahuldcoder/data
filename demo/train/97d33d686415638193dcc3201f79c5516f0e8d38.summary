the league announced that @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 were suspended without pay for varying lengths of time			2
the @entity3 previously suspended @entity2 coach @entity16 for the 2012 season while levying an indefinite suspension on former @entity2 defensive coordinator @entity19 , who was accused of masterminding the bonus program			1
@entity21 , a linebacker who is still with the @entity2 , got suspended for a year , and teammate @entity11 , a defensive end , got a four - game suspension			2
@entity9 , a linebacker with the @entity23 , was suspended for three games while @entity10 , a defensive lineman now with the @entity25 , got an eight - game suspension			2
" it is the obligation of everyone , including the players on the field , to ensure that rules designed to promote player safety , fair play , and the integrity of the game are adhered to and effectively and consistently enforced , " @entity3 commissioner @entity27 said in a statement announcing the suspensions			1
" respect for the men that play the game starts with the way players conduct themselves with each other on the field			0
" the statement said evidence reviewed by the league " demonstrated that from 2009 - 11 @entity2 players of their own accord pledged significant amounts of their own money toward bounties , that players accepted payments for ' cart - offs ' and ' knockouts ' of injured opposing players , and that the payout amounts doubled and tripled for playoff games			1
" @entity21 was a captain of the defensive unit under @entity19 and assisted in creating and funding the bounty program , the @entity3 statement said			1
" multiple independent sources also confirmed that @entity21 offered a specific bounty -- $ 10,000 in cash -- to any player who knocked @entity69 quarterback @entity68 out of the 2009 @entity70 and later pledged the same amount to anyone who knocked @entity74 quarterback @entity73 out of the 2009 @entity75 the following week , " the statement said			0
@entity10 " actively participated in the program " as a @entity77 and obstructed the league 's investigation by " being untruthful , " the statement said , while @entity9 pledged " a significant amount of money " to the program			0
@entity11 , a captain of the defensive unit , helped @entity19 with the program and pledged money for it , according to the statement			0
all four players can appeal the suspensions and would be entitled to a hearing and representation by counsel , the statement said			0
@entity91 , executive director of the @entity92 , said the organization would help the players fight the suspensions			1
" after seeing the @entity3 's decision letters , the @entity92 has still not received any detailed or specific evidence from the league of these specific players ' involvement in an alleged pay - to - injure program , " @entity11 said in a statement			1
" we have made it clear that punishment without evidence is not fair			0
we have spoken with our players and their representatives and we will vigorously protect and pursue all options on their behalf			0
" in addition to the suspensions of @entity19 and @entity16 , the @entity2 were fined $ 500,000 and required to forfeit their second - round selections in the 2012 and 2013 @entity3 drafts			1
the @entity3 also previously announced the suspensions of @entity2 general manager @entity116 for the first eight regular - season games of the 2012 season and @entity2 assistant head coach @entity119 for the first six regular - season games the program involved as many as 27 players and at least one assistant coach , the league concluded after an investigation			1
players regularly contributed cash to a pool , which may have topped $ 50,000 at its peak			0
the players were paid $ 1,500 for a " knockout , " when an opposing player was not able to return to the game , and $ 1,000 for a " cart - off , " when an opposing player had to be carried off the field			0
in some cases , particular players on the opposing team were targeted , the @entity3 said			2
