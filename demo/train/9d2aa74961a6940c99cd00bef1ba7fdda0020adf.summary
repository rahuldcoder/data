-- if anyone knows how to win the @entity3 , it 's trainer @entity4			1
the 62 - year - old explained to @entity0 how she did it in only her first full season as a trainer			1
@entity9 is the heart of the @entity12 horseracing industry			1
at 6.45am on a hazy september morning the sun is threatening to rise over @entity14 , a 500 acre warren of trails and tracks that serves as a training ground for the 1,800 racehorses that are exercised here daily			0
a woman -- in her 60 's , bespectacled , unassuming -- peers into the soupy mist			2
suddenly the silence is broken by the sound of hooves			0
a pair of horses , followed by another pair , and another , canters into view , emerging as if from behind a curtain of fog			0
as the parade of thoroughbreds passes by , snorting steam from their nostrils in the morning air , the woman calmly appraises each one , looking at their legs , theirs heads , occasionally throwing a question to the rider bobbing atop the prancing animal			0
if an unspoken sense of deference hangs in the air , that 's because this woman is no ordinary racehorse trainer			1
she is @entity4 , scion of @entity12 's most famous racing dynasty ; the first female racehorse trainer in @entity12 and the first woman to win the @entity3 , @entity12 's most prestigious race			1
" i 'm the fourth generation of my family to train , " explains @entity4			1
" ever since i was very small i wanted to be a trainer but my dad [ @entity56 , a successful trainer and breeder in his own right ] said , ' no , there are no female trainers in @entity12			1
" ' maybe you can marry a trainer but you wo n't be able to train yourself			2
' so i started working with him as his assistant			0
it took a little time but eventually i applied for my license and in the end they gave it to me			0
that was more than 30 years ago and i 've been training ever since			0
" @entity4 , whose family trace their roots back to @entity75 , has trained for some of the biggest owners both inside and outside @entity12 and has won more than 100 group races , including the @entity3 , which she captured in her first full season as a trainer			1
indeed , the 1979 @entity3 was something of a @entity4 family affair : the winner , @entity84 , was trained by @entity4 , owned by her mother @entity85 and ridden by her brother @entity86 ; then a top jockey , now a trainer himself			1
" i see the race as if it was yesterday			0
@entity86 was in the middle of the pack going very easily			0
before he got into the straight and i said to my mother , ' we 've won the race			0
' she just turned to me and she was furious ! she said ' never say that ! ' but she was traveling so easily , the filly , that when @entity86 pulled her out she just went			0
he never asked her to do anything , she just went			0
it 's something that i 'll never forget			2
" the victory was all the more unusual because @entity84 was only the 10th female horse to win the race , beating older males			1
" that filly was so good , but she had to beat the best , " recalls @entity4			1
" that year there was the winner of the @entity110 and the winner of the @entity112 [ in the race ]			2
for a filly she was very strong			0
she looked more like a male than a female			0
and , like all good fillies , she had a lot of character			0
" although there has not been a female winner of the @entity3 since @entity122 in 2008 , this year 's field features a strong filly contingent , including the favorite @entity124 and the fancied @entity125 -- trained , appropriately , by one @entity126			1
the life of a trainer is one of early starts , late nights , dashed hopes and disappointments ; for every @entity3 winner , there are hundreds of horses who will never make the grade			1
not a life , in short , for anyone who is anything less than 100 % committed to the cause			0
but despite being in her fourth decade as a trainer , @entity4 is showing no signs of slowing down			1
" i 'll keep going as long as i can because it 's very difficult to stop			2
every year you receive new two - year - olds and yearlings and you want to see how they turn out			1
i get up at 5 o'clock every day and i 'll be here until half past 12 , 1 o'clock			0
and that 's every day the same : saturday , sunday , there 's no weekend , nothing			2
but you know , it 's also never the same			2
" with the next generation of @entity159 already coming through , there is no indication that this family 's domination of the @entity12 racing industry is set to come to an end any time soon			1
" @entity86 's got a son who works with him and i 've got a daughter who 's married to a trainer			1
it 's in our blood			2
sometimes i think we have more horse blood than human blood			0

@entity4 is in charge of one @entity12 's most famous racing dynasties
@entity4 trained @entity84 to the @entity3 in her first season
the 62 - year - old 's brother rode @entity84 and is now a trainer himself
