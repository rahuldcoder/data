@entity0 -- prince @entity2 tore up the royal tour rule book on his recent visit to the @entity5 , according to veteran royal photographer @entity6			1
@entity6 should know -- he has covered 200 royal tours , more than anyone			1
and it was an extraordinary royal tour			2
the press coverage surpassed even the media 's expectations			2
@entity2 was himself and it came across on camera			1
people around the world enjoyed getting to know prince @entity18 's younger brother			1
a royal tour is a series of engagements			2
each event is planned months in advance and the press is briefed on what to expect			0
but with @entity2 you never quite know what will happen			1
you know he will arrive and leave , but there is no way to predict what might happen in between			2
watch prince @entity2 talk about " emotional trip " on march 6 , i was in @entity34 , @entity35			1
the entire royal press pack had agreed that the main event of the day would be @entity2 meeting sprinter @entity38 , the fastest man in the world			1
the plan was for @entity38 to give @entity2 some tips on how to come out of the starting blocks			1
we wanted to know if they would go on and race each other			0
the organizers said they did n't know			0
when @entity2 arrived , he immediately hit it off with @entity38			1
they were laughing and goading each other which gave us some great images			0
watch @entity2 take on world 's fastest man but before we knew it , @entity2 had used a distraction technique to get a head start against @entity38 and he raced off to the finish line			1
the image became front page news in the @entity62 and in other parts of the world			0
but while @entity2 is happy enough performing in front of the mainstream media , it 's a relationship of tolerance			1
a senior royal source told me he does have a problem with paparazzi photographers who have invaded his life in the past -- and tormented his mother , @entity75			0
after racing @entity38 , @entity2 set off to meet @entity76 , the staunchly - republican prime minister of @entity35			1
we expected a handshake , we got warm embrace			0
then , at an inner city school we were treated to a spectacular display of @entity2 's dancing skills to a track by @entity84 , who he later impersonated at a state dinner			1
@entity2 even made it on to the fashion pages that day with his eye catching blue suede shoes			2
@entity2 turns every engagement into an event , and that 's what makes him unique as a royal			1
the royal source told me @entity2 did n't have a strategy for this tour			1
" he just went for it			0
" but do n't assume he 's just having fun			2
this is someone who puts duty first			0
it 's a lesson he took from his grandmother , @entity104 , i am told			2
it was out of duty that he agreed to go on the trip on her behalf			0
while he enjoyed the tour , for him it is always about supporting the queen and only she would be the judge of whether it was a success			0
so what did she make of his time in the @entity5 ? @entity1 has learned that everyone , including the queen and @entity2 's father , prince @entity120 , " was very pleased and proud " of his performance			1
the palace source was speaking to @entity1 for a documentary airing this weekend : " the @entity123 : @entity2 , @entity120			1
" it 's the first in a four - part @entity1 series to mark the diamond jubilee of @entity104 's reign			1
the source says the @entity5 tour was a milestone in @entity2 's life			1
it was the first time people got to see him as a whole rather than in a series of snapshots			0
the public believe @entity2 is a special and gifted young man , the source said			1
he is particularly good at reading situations , and people saw that on display over a period of time			0
@entity2 was seen as possessing a confidence and emotional intelligence that allowed him to move naturally from goofing with @entity38 , to connecting with a young child to being a statesman			2
@entity2 , i am told however , would never see himself as a statesmen			2
so has prince @entity2 finally come of age ? is the man who once wore a @entity152 outfit to a party and got into all other sorts of trouble now consigned to the past ? the royal source puts it like this : " the impulsiveness of @entity2 's youth has turned into the fun you saw on the @entity38 track in @entity35			1
" in another sign of his maturity , @entity1 has learned that prince @entity2 has finally left home			1
he recently moved out of his father 's residence , @entity170 -- where he had a bedroom and study -- into a small flat at @entity174 where his brother and sister - in - law live			0
@entity2 wanted to have his own place , and the two brothers " wanted to be together , " the source said			2
the @entity180 and @entity181 , prince @entity18 and his new bride @entity181 , are living in @entity182 at the moment but will move into a large apartment in the main building when renovations are complete			0
when they move , @entity2 will take over the cottage			2
watch more about @entity18 's palace upgrade @entity2 recently referred to the @entity181 as his " sister			1
" it was a slip of the tongue but indicative of the closeness of their relationship , says the source			0
but it is the relationship between the two brothers that looks set to define the future of the @entity62 monarchy most of all			0
the source tells me : " prince @entity2 and prince @entity18 are a double act for the rest of their lives			1
they are very loyal and trust each other			0
@entity2 is very respectful towards @entity18			2
" i am told the brothers are also aware of their different , but complementary qualities			0
@entity18 , second - in - line to the throne , is due to be king one day , but this could be decades away			0
when it does happen , the monarchy is likely to be a slimmed down version of what we see today			0
there wo n't be an array of siblings and cousins sharing official duties			0
the two princes know they will bear the brunt of responsibility for royal engagements , so it needs to be a partnership			0
but @entity2 's current priority is his military career			1
his only official duties for the rest of this are likely to be occasional appearances to mark the queen 's diamond jubilee and as an @entity241 ambassador			0
@entity2 came out as the top gunner on his recent @entity244 course			1
he would n't have accepted the award if he thought it was bestowed on him because of who he is , my source tells me			0
read more about @entity2 's helicopter training the prince loathes being treated as anything but an ordinary officer			1
his military colleagues say they often forget his royal status			0
the army provides @entity2 with normality			2
according to a friend who trained with @entity2 , he even has a nickname which goes back to his time at the @entity260 at @entity261 : @entity262			2
the prince is currently preparing for redeployment to @entity265			1
his last military mission to the country was cut short when news leaked that he was on the ground			0
the media strategy this time round is still being worked out , but news blackouts are n't seen as viable anymore in an age of social media , so this deployment may well be announced			0
but if the @entity277 knows that he is there , wo n't that make him and his regiment a target ? it 's a matter for the military but my senior royal source tells me : " the thinking is that being an @entity288 pilot is quite an anonymous job and the @entity288 is already a target			2
they ca n't be more of a target than they already are			0
" the palace does n't see a need for @entity2 to have extra personal security in @entity265 either because his military base will , by its nature , already be secure			1
@entity2 says he has three hats : soldier , prince and 27 - year - old with buddies			1
he endeavors to be himself whichever hat he is wearing , and that 's what defines him			0
at different points in his life one hat will be more important than the others , which is why right now , he is the soldier prince .			0

prince @entity2 different to other royals , says veteran snapper @entity6
@entity1 's @entity315 says with @entity2 , anything can happen
@entity2 's recent @entity5 tour seen as a milestone in his public role
@entity120 's priority remains military career and possible redeployment to @entity265
