-- it 's no secret among @entity3 football fans that for many years the @entity5 's attempts to embrace football -- or soccer as they like to call it -- were treated with derision			1
their players were n't as good , the sport did n't have any history , the terminology was all wrong and the commentators would get way too excited over average plays			2
the ill - fated @entity22 , with its countdown clock and refusal to accept a draw as a genuine result , was proof to everyone else that they just did n't get it			0
but things have changed dramatically in recent years and overseas fans are now being forced to accept that the @entity5 may actually get it all too well			1
@entity30 has doubled its size in less than a decade , now claiming to be the seventh most supported league in the world			1
and the appetite to consume the game in any way possible has boomed , with the value of @entity39 tv rights packages tripling			0
it wo n't have escaped the attention of many @entity43 football fans that their teams are now owned by @entity5 investors			1
this week 's announcement that @entity47 will become majority shareholders in the league 's 20th franchise in @entity51 is proof that the strongest football markets are now taking the @entity5 seriously			1
meanwhile , @entity47 and @entity54 's post-season tour of @entity55 , coming at the end of a long and tiring year for both sides , demonstrates how important the @entity5 market is becoming for @entity39 teams			1
it 's good for business when @entity62 , @entity63 and @entity64 fight over the right to broadcast their games from @entity67 , but those teams have to fly over the @entity69 in order to cultivate a fan base and stoke the interest			0
on thursday , @entity47 and @entity54 wowed a crowd of almost 50,000 fans in @entity75 with a seven goal thriller and on saturday , @entity51 fans were lining up for more of the same at @entity78			1
but not everyone is a big fan of these post-season tours			0
the players are contractually obligated but surely many of them would n't be here by choice			0
and the @entity67 manager @entity84 has expressed his concern with the ever increasing demands on club players , who are exhausted by the time they show up for international duty			0
but there may come a time when @entity39 sides are n't made to feel quite so welcome on this side of the pond			0
in fact , we might be there already			0
as @entity30 grows in strength and stature , franchise owners want to build and promote their own fan base			1
they 're not going to want their own potential supporters investing financially and emotionally in clubs from thousands of miles away in @entity104 and @entity105			0
at least not now , not while those teams are bigger and better , with players whose star appeal is significantly brighter			0
but @entity47 might just have struck the perfect balance			2
by owning a team in each league , they 'll have a foot in both camps			2
the @entity5 team will benefit from @entity47 's scouting network and player development , and club @entity105 will learn from the @entity5 ' marketing expertise and reap the financial rewards of @entity30 success			1
and in @entity105 , at least , @entity43 fans will no longer be laughing at their @entity5 cousins .			2

the @entity5 has turned into an important market in the world of soccer
@entity47 sees the benefits , becoming majority owner of a new @entity30 team
the new @entity5 team can learn from @entity47 , and vice versa
