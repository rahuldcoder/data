-- the trouble with boxing is , people get hurt			1
some time soon , according to " @entity5 , " the sport will get a radical technological upgrade and human pugilists will be replaced by robots ; combatants who will fight to the death every time they climb into the ring			1
in a sport like that the machines might get the glory , but you will still find human interest in the corner , where trainers have been replaced by computer programmers , engineers , welders , and if you go down far enough , old fashioned managers like @entity14 ( @entity15 ) , an ex-boxer so deep in debt he 's nearly out for the count			1
reunited with the 11 - year - old son he 's practically forgotten , @entity14 promptly sells him to the boy 's aunt and uncle			2
but the boy wo n't be sidelined quite so easily			2
he 's a fight fan himself , and he means to go on the road with his old man and more importantly with the junkyard sparring bot " @entity36 " he rescues from scrap			2
this is " transformers " for kids , basically -- and yes , i appreciate you might think " transformers " would have that demographic covered , but apparently nobody told @entity44 , who pitched his three movies at teens and up			2
" @entity49 " director @entity48 does not make the same mistake			0
although it 's rated @entity52 for some mildly adult language and robot - on - robot violence ( and i think we can be sure that no robots were harmed in the course of this film ) , " @entity5 " is fundamentally about a son reconnecting with his dad , something @entity48 never lets us forget for long			1
it 's as corny as @entity63 , but the mix of old fashioned heart and new fangled animatronic cyber tech will make this picture a winner for fathers and sons ( @entity48 has squeezed in a cameo for his three young daughters , but the female characters are mostly relegated to cheering from the stands )			0
@entity15 is doing a minor variation on his @entity77 signature tune , but for the best part of the movie he lets the obnoxiously talented @entity80 as his son runs rings around him , stealing one scene after another			1
it 's an uneven fight -- rigged by screenwriter @entity86 , aided and abetted by @entity48 -- but it 's fun to see the kid make a chump of the champ			0
surprisingly , @entity48 resists turning @entity36 into an autonomous character			0
he does have some neat features though			0
he 's smaller and weaker than most of his competition , with pale blue bulbs for eyes beneath what looks like a fencing mask			0
but he can take a beating and in " shadow mode " he mimics his coach 's movements with lightning speed			0
he can dance too -- like a six - foot , three - ton butterfly			0
robots aside , @entity48 does n't go in for futurism really			1
the locations are steeped in the heartland : a cavernous boxing gym that smacks of the 1920s			1
@entity14 's truck looks like something out of a 1940s film			1
@entity113 motel signs , back - country roads , and an old @entity116 auto plant repurposed as a post-industrial sports arena			0
there 's a broader nostalgia at work here , as if the fight 's gone out of the whole country and one plucky kid and his pet robot could galvanize the whole show			0
did they really need to fall back on xenophobic shorthand to pump up the climactic bout , when @entity36 takes on @entity129 , a robot combining @entity132 know - how and @entity134 money ? and could n't someone have called time on the over-the - top product placement that clogs up the finale ? in the end , " @entity5 " wo n't win any prizes for innovation , but it works -- it 's a technical knockout .			1

" @entity5 " stars @entity15 as a struggling boxing *promoter*
the film is set in the future during a time when robots can box
*reviewer* says the movie is a " technical knockout "
