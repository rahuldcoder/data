-- @entity1 has been suspended by his @entity4 - based @entity3 cycling team amid claims that the @entity6 gave himself a blood transfusion			1
@entity1 -- who only returned to the sport last march after being handed a 20 - month ban for doping during the 2008 @entity10 -- was admitted to a hospital in @entity12 on sunday			1
his father told reporters at the time that @entity1 had been suffering from a high fever and suspected kidney failure			1
but @entity6 media claimed the 27 - year - old had admitted to doctors that he had made himself ill by injecting contaminated blood			1
and now his team have issued an official statement , saying they have found enough proof of a doping infraction to suspend the rider with immediate effect			1
the statement said : " @entity29 research results following the illness and rumors regarding @entity1 have given the team sufficient reason to suspend the @entity6 with immediate effect			1
" it continued : " last tuesday , the team started an urgent investigation following the hospitalisation of @entity1			2
three days later the results of this study brought the team to the conclusion that an immediate suspension of @entity1 was required			0
" the violation of internal regulations of the team and other indications justify this measure			0
the team can not prejudge but emphasises that a zero - tolerance policy towards doping is practised			0
" blood doping -- an action that increases the amount of red blood cells available to carry oxygen to the muscles -- has been a problem in cycling for a number of years , with disgraced 2006 @entity10 winner @entity56 admitting last year that he blood - doped during his career			2
blood cells are not damaged by freezing , consequently a " blood doper " can remove blood from their body , safely store it , and re-inject it when increased aerobic capacity and stamina is needed			0
however , if the blood is stored incorrectly , it can become infected , resulting in severe illness if transfused			0
the practice of blood doping is banned by all official sporting governing bodies and @entity1 now faces expulsion from competitive cycling if found guilty , as well as a possible jail sentence in a country where all forms of doping are classed as illegal			2
@entity1 has yet to react to the claims surrounding his hospital stay .			0
