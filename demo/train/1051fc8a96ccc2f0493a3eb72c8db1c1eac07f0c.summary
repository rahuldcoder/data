-- that did n't take long			0
just two weeks since the @entity3 struck down @entity4 of the @entity5 , state legislatures are moving quickly on voter suppression measures			1
already , six of the nine states that were previously covered by the requirement that changes in voting procedures be pre-cleared have started to bring up restrictive voter id laws			2
if there is a glimmer of hope for voting rights advocates , however , it 's that the court merely ruled that the formula was outdated , and that @entity20 " may draft another formula based on current conditions			0
" i agree with the court that indeed , the previous formula included in the @entity5 does not address today 's attempts to restrict the right to vote			1
in fact , i think it underestimates them			0
under the former formula used by the @entity5 , nine entire states and certain counties and municipalities in six additional states were required to obtain federal preclearance before passing new voting laws			1
but according to the @entity39 , already in 2013 more than 30 states , including my home state of @entity38 , have introduced more than 80 bills that would restrict the right to vote			2
these bills would do everything from requiring photo identification at the polls , to limiting early voting opportunities , to creating burdensome registration requirements			0
although these efforts are not as blatant as previous voter suppression techniques such as literacy tests and violent intimidation , they are still discriminatory			1
the victims of these voter suppression efforts are usually the same , no matter the state : minority and low - income voters , the elderly and students			1
in a country built on the foundation of civic participation , voting should be our most fundamental right , the right that ensures all other rights we possess			0
but the right to vote is , contrary to popular belief , not explicitly guaranteed by our @entity69			1
although the right is inherent or implied throughout our founding document , and amendments prohibit discrimination based on race , gender , and age , we possess no affirmative right to vote			0
if we did , state lawmakers would n't continue to pass , and courts would not continue to uphold , these various restrictive voting laws			0
so rep. @entity81 of @entity82 and i have proposed a solution that we believe accurately reflects the current voting rights landscape ; a solution that applies to all 50 states and protects the voting rights of all who call this country home			2
this spring we introduced a " @entity96 to vote " amendment to the @entity69 that would guarantee an affirmative right to vote for all @entity94 , no matter where they live			1
our amendment is both simple and absolutely necessary : it ensures that every @entity94 citizen possesses the fundamental right to vote in any public election where he or she resides , and empowers @entity20 with the authority to protect this right			2
the consequences of this amendment would be profound for the rights of voters everywhere			0
now , it is the voter who has to demonstrate that his or her right to vote has been impeded by the state			0
with the ratification of our amendment , the burden of proof would switch to the states , which would have to demonstrate that they possess a compelling interest to restrict a voter 's rights			1
this would mean that all of the states who believe that we need voter id laws to protect against a " crisis " of voter fraud would actually need to demonstrate that such a crisis existed			1
predictably , when an investigation into voter fraud was launched in @entity38 in conjunction with proposed voter id legislation , barely a case was found when someone had voted in place of someone else			2
other studies have found the same thing			0
voter id laws to counter voter fraud represent little more than a cure in search of a disease , and states must be stopped from implementing these discriminatory measures			1
while the recent dismantling of the @entity5 is certainly disheartening , we have a chance to strengthen our fundamental right to vote			2
as president @entity157 declared in 1965 to a joint session of @entity20 to encourage passage of the landmark legislation , " there is no duty which weighs more heavily on us than the duty we have to ensure that right			0
" and there is no way that we can better protect that right than through a right to vote amendment to our @entity69			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

@entity168 : states are moving on voter suppression measures after @entity5 ruling
@entity168 : a " right to vote " amendment would guarantee voting for all @entity94
despite popular belief , he says , @entity69 does not guarantee right to vote
@entity168 : voter fraud *nonexistent* ; states would have to prove a reason to restrict rights
