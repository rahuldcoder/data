@entity0 , @entity1 -- life is slowly getting back to normal at the women 's campus of @entity0 's @entity6			2
the young women who study here chatter on the school 's well - manicured lawns , their brightly - colored scarves and @entity13 dresses blowing in the wind on a sunny autumn day			0
barely three weeks ago , this quiet place of learning was the scene of a nightmare			0
on october 20 , two suicide bombers launched near simultaneous attacks on both the men 's and women 's side of the campus			2
@entity26 , 20 , is in mourning			0
three of her classmates , girls she describes as " shining stars , " were killed on that terrible day			2
still , she says the carnage could have been much worse if not for the actions of a lowly janitor , who was also killed			0
" if he did n't stop the suicide attacker , there could have been great , great destruction , " @entity35 says			2
" he 's now a legend to us , " says another 20 - year - old student named @entity41			0
" because he saved our lives , our friends ' lives			0
" the janitor 's name was @entity49			1
according to eyewitness accounts , the attacker approached disguised in women 's clothing			0
he shot the guard on duty , and then approached the cafeteria , which was packed with hundreds of female students			1
@entity49 intercepted the bomber in the doorway , however , and the bomber self - detonated right outside the crowded hall , spraying many of his explosive vest 's arsenal of ball bearings out into the parking lot instead of into the cafeteria			1
" the sweeper who was cleaning up here saw someone outside and went towards him , " said @entity69 , a cafeteria worker who was wounded in the head , leg and arm by the blast			1
" [ @entity49 ] told him that he could not come inside because there were girls inside			1
and then they started arguing			0
and then we heard a loud blast and all the glass broke			0
" " between 300 to 400 girls were sitting in there , " said professor @entity83 , the rector of the university			1
" [ @entity87 ] rose above the barriers of caste , creed and sectarian terrorism			0
despite being a @entity92 , he sacrificed his life to save the @entity95 girls			1
" @entity49 was a member of @entity13 's @entity92 minority , traditionally one of the poorest communities in the country			1
when the attacker struck , @entity49 had been on the job for less than a week , earning barely $ 60 a month			1
@entity49 lived with seven other family members , in a single room in a crowded apartment house in the city of @entity105			1
until the attack his mother , 70 - year old @entity106 , worked as a cleaning lady at a nearby house to help make ends meet			0
now , she makes a daily pilgrimage to the cemetery where @entity49 is buried			1
asked if she was proud that some people were calling her son a hero , @entity113 waved a hand in the air dismissively , answering , " my hero is dead now			0
" she pulls out a framed photo of her son , pictured wearing a button down white shirt and a thick mustache			0
when @entity49 's three - year - old daughter @entity125 sees his photo , she reaches for it , saying , " @entity128 , i want that picture			1
" from time to time , @entity125 turns to her mother and repeats one word , " @entity132			0
" the @entity6 offered to give @entity125 a free education and employ @entity49 's widow , @entity134			1
meanwhile , the @entity13 government has promised to award @entity49 's family 1 million rupees ( about $ 12,000 ) for his bravery			2
" he is a national hero because he saved the life of many girls , " said @entity138 , minister of minorities in the @entity13 government			1
" as a @entity92 , a person of minority , he stood in front of the @entity144 to protect the university			1
" but the grave of this national hero is a sorry sight			1
it is located in the poorer , garbage - strewn @entity92 half of a neighborhood cemetery , less then three feet from a muddy road			2
@entity49 's mother and widow visit every day			2
one of his sisters crosses herself , then stoops down to pick up an empty pack of cigarettes someone threw onto the little mound of earth			0
the family had to borrow money to pay for @entity49 's funeral and they are now behind on paying the rent			2
if the government money comes through , @entity49 's mother would like to decorate her son 's grave			2
" i would like him to have his name in cement with a nice poetry verse , " she says			0
" and there should be a fence surrounding his grave			0
