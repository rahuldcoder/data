@entity0 -- when @entity3 retired in 1987 , he was asked how the quality of people elected to @entity6 had changed in his 30 - plus years of service			1
the former @entity8 answered : " the quality is clearly better , much better			2
" but , he added , " the results are definitely worse			2
" he meant : as compared to the @entity11 of the 1950s , the @entity11 of the 1980s contained fewer drunks and fewer crooks			0
members were better educated and harder working			0
yet the @entity11 of the 1950s managed to balance the budget , confirm presidential nominees in reasonable time and enact programs , like the one that created the interstate highway system			1
the congresses of the 1980s could do none of those things			0
and of course the contemporary record is even worse			0
this past summer , @entity6 very nearly pushed the @entity27 into an unnecessary default			1
the budgeting of the @entity27 is in chaos			1
the @entity32 has been left for months with two vacancies on its seven - member board because of secret holds by individual senators			0
politics is a contest , limited by certain unwritten rules			1
and over the past two decades , old rules have broken down			1
under the old rules , there were certain things that political parties did not do -- even though theoretically they could			1
if one party controlled the @entity45 and another party controlled the presidency , the @entity45 party did not reject all the president 's nominees			1
the party that controlled the @entity52 did not refuse to schedule votes on the president 's budgets			1
individual senators did not use secret holds to sway national policy			0
the filibuster was reserved for rare circumstances -- not as a routine 60 - vote requirement on every @entity45 vote			1
it 's incredible to look back now on how the @entity64 tax cut passed the @entity65 @entity52 in 1981			2
the @entity65 @entity52 leaderships could have refused to schedule votes on @entity64 's tax plans			2
instead , they not only allowed the tax plan to proceed -- but they allowed 48 of 243 @entity65 to break ranks on the key procedural vote without negative consequences to their careers in the @entity65 party			0
( rep. @entity75 of @entity76 , for example , who voted for the tax cuts would rise to become secretary of agriculture under president @entity80			0
) hard to imagine speaker @entity81 allowing his republicans to get away with similar behavior on a measure proposed by president @entity85			0
what 's happening before our eyes is that the @entity27 congressional system is adopting the attitudes of a @entity92 - style parliamentary system			1
in a parliamentary system , " the duty of an opposition is to oppose " ( in the famous words of @entity96 )			2
the opposition uses every trick and technique to thwart and defeat the government ; the government uses all the powers of a parliamentary majority to overwhelm the opposition			2
( to quote @entity96 again : " a majority is always better than the best repartee			0
" ) then , at regular intervals , the two sides switch roles			0
in the @entity27 system , there is no " government " and no " opposition			1
" who would lead such a " government " ? president @entity85 ? or the man in command of the majority in the lower house -- prime minister @entity81 ? in a system built around an administration and a bicameral @entity6 , everybody is part of the government -- and the government only functions if there exists a certain baseline spirit of cooperation between the mutually indispensable parts			1
that spirit of cooperation has tended to vanish in recent years			1
back in 1986 , @entity65 leaders quashed those in their party who wished to try impeach @entity64 over @entity136			0
but as the @entity139 ended , the party struggle intensified			0
the shock of the economic crisis since 2008 has made things worse still : desperate times lead to desperate politics			0
the old rules were based upon certain conditions that have long since vanished			2
back then , @entity6 was filled with legislators who shared the common bond of military service : in 1981 , 73 of the senators were veterans as compared to only 25 today ; a similar trend characterizes the @entity52			0
the imperatives of the @entity139 inspired a spirit of deference to the president			0
the long association of the filibuster with opposition to civil rights tended to discredit its use			2
the national media were dominated by a few big institutions that professed ( even if they did not always deliver ) nonpartisanship			0
@entity27 intermingled more with people of different points of view			1
@entity169 points out in his important book , " @entity172 , " in the very close presidential election of 1976 , only 26 % of @entity27 lived in a county that went for @entity174 or @entity175 by a margin of 20 points or more			1
in the also close presidential election of 2004 , almost 50 % of @entity27 lived in a county that voted by more than 20 points for either @entity181 or @entity182			1
perhaps above all : the long prosperity of the postwar years lubricated the system with enough resources that just about everybody could get some of what they wanted : more spending , moderate taxes , reasonable borrowing , strong national defense			2
now instead we have a country that is spatially polarized , that gets its information from highly partisan media , and that confronts the worst recession and the darkest financial outlook since the 1930s			0
the results of these changes are breaking the @entity27 political system -- destroying public confidence in the @entity27 government -- and paralyzing the @entity27 economic policy			1
it will take more than a change in attitudes to address these concerns			0
it will take fundamental institutional reform			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			1

@entity214 : in past 30 years , rules of *bipartisan* cooperation have *dissolved*
he says use of filibuster is now routine , presidential *appointments* are *stalled*
@entity214 says parties are acting as if their only *choices* are to govern or to oppose
@entity27 's government is built on the idea that opposing parties will work together
