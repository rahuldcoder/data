@entity0 , @entity1 -- a sweet sadness blankets @entity5 's face , appropriate , perhaps , for a middle - age man who has seen suffering and miracles at once			1
many other rescuers have left the @entity1 capital , no hope left in their hearts 15 long days after the massive earthquake that ravaged this country and entombed so many in the rubble			1
every day for more than a week , he has stepped down into the dark crevices of a destroyed building to look for two people : @entity19 and his 4 - year - old son @entity20			1
@entity20 's mother , @entity21 , a @entity22 employee from @entity23 who has been living in @entity1 for four years , was at work when the earth shook violently on january 12			1
rescuers pulled her 1 - year - old daughter @entity27 alive from the rubble , but there was no sign of her husband and son			1
she refused to believe they were dead			1
word of her plight reached @entity5 , who had arrived in @entity0 with a team of 25 @entity38 rescue workers			1
" we told her we wo n't leave			1
we will stay by her side , " @entity5 said			1
he has a grandchild the same age as @entity20			1
his orange jumpsuit dulled by dust , @entity5 and his crew made camp adjacent to the rubble of the landmark @entity51			2
they slept out in the open , with @entity54 and her friend			2
they took short naps to re-energize			2
then they went back in to search			2
each day , they pulled things from the place that @entity54 called home : a stuffed animal , her husband 's computer , a piece of carpet			1
it helped @entity5 to know what room of the apartment they had entered			2
he kept moving , deeper and deeper			2
in search of the slightest sound			2
of an infant 's whimper , a man 's weak cry for help			1
@entity5 became convinced father and son might be alive			1
he knows well the science of rescue after doing it for a quarter century			2
" there is no smell , " he said			2
and that could mean they were alive			1
even two weeks after the earth shook , people were being rescued			2
he believes in the power of love			2
the strong bonds between a man and his child , trapped together			2
that link , he thought , could be enough to sustain them			1
a veteran of many disasters after a killer earthquake struck his hometown of @entity106 in 1985 , @entity5 , 46 , felt a need to give back the humanitarian gestures extended to his own people			1
he joined a team called the @entity111 , or moles , named so because the rescuers wriggled through the deepest darkest corners in search of life			0
he volunteered to rush to disasters : to @entity119 quakes , five times ; to @entity122 countries ; to @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 and @entity126 ; to @entity127 , @entity128 , after @entity129 and to @entity130 after the 2001 terror attacks			1
@entity1 , he said , is one of the worst situations he has seen			1
" people are very , very poor here			0
" much of the infrastructure and construction was so shoddy			0
this was the first time government officials paid for his flight			0
usually , he finds his own way			0
and that has left him penniless and jobless			0
" who will hire this old man now ? " he asked			0
" people tell me i am mad			0
" he does the work because he loves to help people			0
" it 's worth it to find one person alive			1
" behind him , the incessant sound of a jackhammer deafened the ear			0
above him , the roar of jets taking off from the airport			0
but it was below where @entity5 belonged			0
sometimes , in the darkness , when he was crawling like a mole , the earth trembled			0
" replica ! replica ! " some of his men shouted			0
there was always the fear that whatever was left standing would tumble in the many aftershocks this city has felt			0
" we laugh , " he said			0
" we do n't scream like ladies			0
there is nothing you can do inside			0
it would be an honor to die in the rubble			0
" from other people , the statement might seem trite			0
but @entity5 's eyes make you believe			1
he is called @entity185 because people say he looks @entity187			0
he says he has the look of a fierce @entity38 @entity125			0
after so many days , @entity5 was running on two hours sleep -- and hope			0
but late wednesday his search finally ended			1
his men found two bodies buried deep in the apartment			0
@entity20 was in his father 's arms			1
in @entity1 , @entity5 had hoped for a miracle			1
instead , he saw more suffering			1
this , too , will define the curves of his face .			0

rescuer searched every day for a woman 's husband and 4 - year - old son in @entity1
he believed father and son could be alive , that their bond could sustain them
the *response* to a quake in his own country *inspired* him to assist in disasters
his efforts ended not as he had hoped , but with the sight of more suffering
