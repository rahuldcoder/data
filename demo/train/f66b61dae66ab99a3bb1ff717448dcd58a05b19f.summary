@entity0 -- a @entity3 businessman gets into a cab in @entity0			2
at first he 's relieved -- the last few taxis passed straight by him , which is not unusual -- it can be difficult for @entity8 nationals to get a cab			2
but then comes an uncomfortable question from the driver : " is n't it difficult living in a country with so many black people ? " a question that highlighted another issue : while @entity8 nationals can have trouble getting a cab , it can be even worse for those with darker skin			1
project manager @entity23 has lived in @entity24 for eight years			1
he long suspected that taxis were not picking him up because he is an @entity26			1
recently his suspicions were confirmed when he asked a driver why he had hesitated to take him			2
" the driver said , ' i worry @entity30 will run off and not pay			2
' " but catching a cab is n't the only problem			2
another common misconception @entity23 has to contend with is that he is a drug dealer , he said			0
" i 'll be with a group of friends and someone specifically comes up to ask me if i have drugs			0
at first i was offended			0
now i tease them and say : ' no , do you have drugs ? ' " @entity23 laughs off such incidents , finding humor in the ignorance			0
others have been less fortunate			0
@entity47 student @entity46 moved to @entity24 just two months ago			1
he said he has already been subjected to several racist remarks			0
" one time i was walking down the street and someone called me a stupid black c * * * , " he reported			2
" maybe it was because i was with a @entity24 girl and they do n't like that			1
" reports of this kind of racism date back to when @entity30 were first welcomed into @entity24 to study at @entity24 universities in the 1960s			1
and in 1988 , a violent , 300 - strong mob broke into an @entity65 students ' dormitory at @entity66 and destroyed their possessions while chanting " down with the black devils			2
" the number of @entity30 and foreigners living in @entity24 has risen significantly since then			1
communities have grown up in major cities such as @entity73 , where 20,000 @entity30 now live , according to official figures			0
some scholars , trying to account for the number of undocumented migrants , put the estimate at around 200,000			0
however , " even in those cities where there is now a concentration of black people , still most @entity24 have little to no contact with them , " said @entity79 , a professor of social sciences at the @entity81 who specializes in the issue of race in @entity24			1
as such , their ideas about blacks are largely shaped by the media , @entity79 , said , adding , " in the media , @entity30 is portrayed as a house of horrors , with a huge number of people dying from diseases , wars and extremely high crime rates			0
" cultural bias against dark skin but it is not just @entity30 and those of @entity65 descent who report prejudices in @entity24 ; others with darker skin are also affected			1
@entity110 from @entity111 in @entity112 has worked in finance in @entity24 for six years			1
he recalled @entity0 's visa crackdown on foreigners working or living illegally in the city around the time of the @entity118			1
" i was set to move into a house , but when i went with the landlord to the police station to register , he told me i could n't live there because the police did n't want brown people in the vicinity , " he recalled			0
" my white @entity65 roommate had no problem			0
" although @entity110 believes the situation has since improved , he still feels that " if you are brown here , you are not equal			2
" he added : " they assume dark skinned people are doing something dodgy			0
if there 's a white person in the room , they 'd rather speak to the white person			0
" @entity141 skin has historically been prized in @entity24 and much of @entity142			1
even today skin - lightening products remain popular			0
" conversely , darker skin is associated with being a peasant , " said @entity79			0
" so , if you think peasants are oafish and backwards , you associate darker skin with that			0
" however , experts say , just because there is a historic prejudice against dark skin in @entity24 , it was never a given that this prejudice would automatically translate into prejudice against races with darker skins			1
@entity79 believes that type of prejudice was imported from the @entity161			2
" it was imported as early as the 1880s by @entity24 intellectuals exposed to the @entity166 racist literature			1
during the @entity169 era , expressing such ideas fell out of fashion			0
instead , the state promoted the idea that the @entity24 should join @entity30 and rise up together against the white imperialists , " said @entity79			1
but from the beginning of @entity24 's reform era from the late 1970s , some @entity166 ideas were allowed to flood back in			1
while the @entity24 government maintains there is no racisim here -- many clearly beg to differ			1
but they say , given that racism seems less historically entrenched in @entity24 than in the @entity161 , there is hope it can be stamped out more easily			1
the ' @entity187 effect ' some non-chinese nationals say the election of @entity190 president @entity187 and the growing number of black sports stars playing for @entity24 teams - such as basketball 's @entity194 and footballer @entity196 - has helped change perceptions			1
a study conducted by @entity199 at @entity200 and @entity201 at @entity202 showed that negative stereotypes held about african - americans -- for example , that they were ' violent ' , ' loud ' or ' aggressive ' -- were less likely to be held by @entity24 people after president @entity187 's election			1
meanwhile @entity30 and african - americans living in @entity24 report that since the election , @entity24 people they meet are now more likely to bring up the president or the latest athlete signed to a @entity24 team than mention negative stereotypes			1
real - life encounters with ordinary @entity30 and african - americans also play a part in dispelling racist myths			0
in a study of attitudes in @entity73 , @entity79 found a correlation between @entity24 people actually living and working with @entity30 and having a more positive attitude towards the @entity65 community there			1
@entity23 , for his part , said : " i try to present myself in such a way that i always leave a good impression			0
the racism here might be blatant , but , unlike the @entity161 , because it 's not hidden , i know what i am dealing with			0
i can openly talk to people about it and help change impressions			0
" @entity233 , an @entity26 who has been in @entity24 for eight years feels the same			1
" yes , i 've sometimes had people stare or touch my skin , as if to see whether it 's going to rub off , " she said			0
" but i think this comes from curiosity not negativity			0
here i do n't feel the racial tension i feel back home			0
i 've done things , such as setting up my own geophysics company , which as i black woman i might not have been able to do in the @entity245			2
" yes , i 'm treated differently from @entity24 people			2
but here i 'm different first , black second			2

non-white foreigners living in @entity24 report more instances of prejudice
@entity26 report greater difficulty getting cabs , suspicions of *criminal* behavior
study : @entity24 perceptions have improved since election of @entity190 president @entity187
the signing of *celebrated* black athletes to @entity24 teams is also improving relations
