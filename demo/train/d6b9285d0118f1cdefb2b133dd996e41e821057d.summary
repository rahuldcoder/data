it 's going to be a moment you 'll remember for all time			0
and now that it 's happened , you 'll remember it for a much different reason			0

the 56 - year - old singer says she 's fine			2
the darn cape was just tied too tight			0
here 's what happened : @entity6 was belting out " @entity22 " at the @entity20 in @entity21			1
it 's a song that coincidentally includes the lyrics " lifted me up and watched me stumble , after the heartache i 'm gon na carry on			0

and down goes @entity6 ! if she was in pain , she did n't show it , getting back to her feet and finishing the number			2
