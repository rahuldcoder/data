@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 authorities said tuesday they have recaptured 65 of the more than 400 inmates who slipped out of a southern @entity1 prison a day earlier through a nearly quarter - mile tunnel dug beneath the compound			1
a massive search operation continues to find the others -- many of them insurgent fighters , said the @entity12 governor 's office			1
the @entity13 issued a statement taking responsibility for the escape from the prison in @entity12 , the @entity13 's birthplace			1
@entity13 spokesman @entity18 said digging the tunnel took five months			1
the escape took four and a half hours , he said			0
the @entity13 claimed 541 prisoners escaped			0
the @entity24 - led @entity23 said the number of escaped prisoners was closer to 470			0
the @entity13 said 106 of the escapees were military commanders , but there was no immediate government confirmation of the claim			1
monday 's break was the second escape at the prison in three years			2
in 2008 , as many as 1,000 prisoners -- nearly half of them @entity13 members -- escaped after militants detonated a truck bomb against the side of the prison compound			2
the prison houses some of the country 's most dangerous @entity13 prisoners , and the escape was an embarrassment for the @entity1 government and its @entity49 allies , said @entity2 national security analyst @entity50			1
" it 's , i think , quite a black eye for the @entity52 and @entity24 and the @entity1 government , who have put quite a lot of resources into trying to improve the prison systems , and here you have this massive prison break , with sadly , some pretty hardcore @entity13 prisoners who escaped , " he said			1
@entity61 , a spokesman for @entity1 president @entity62 , called the mass escape " bad news and a disaster			1
" although the @entity13 said some of the escapees were military commanders , it 's unlikely the escape will have a significant impact on military operations in @entity1 , said @entity72 , director of the @entity73 at the @entity74 in @entity75			1
" i do n't think i would see this as a big blow to @entity49 efforts in @entity1 , " he said			0
instead , he said @entity1 's government is likely to bear the brunt of criticism for failing to anticipate or prevent the escape , especially after previous escapes at this and other prisons			2
in the 2008 escape , militants used a truck loaded with about two tons of explosives and driven by suicide drivers to blast holes in the mud brick walls of the prison			0
a gun and rocket battle followed , lasting several hours and ending with militants rushing into the prison on motorcycles to free prisoners , according to @entity13 accounts of the attack			2
nine guards , seven prisoners and one civilian were killed in the attack , according to the provincial government			0
security forces said they tried to track down the escaped prisoners , but said the large @entity13 presence in the region and the numerous hideouts located there made it difficult to hunt down militants			0
@entity12 has been the site of fierce fighting between international forces and insurgents			0
it has been the site of numerous @entity120 demonstrations , recently over the burning of the quran , @entity124 's holy book , by a pastor in the @entity52			0
on april 15 , the police chief of @entity12 province was killed when a man wearing a military uniform detonated a bomb at the entrance to the police headquarters			2
in february , 10 people died when mines exploded at a playground during a picnic hosted by a former police commander			0
in a separate incident , 19 people , including 15 police officers , died when armed attackers targeted police headquarters			0
after attacks on the country 's ministry of defense , the assassination of the police chief and now monday 's prison break , @entity12 resident @entity143 said it 's " impossible to call this system a government			1
" " this is the worst possible weakness of the @entity1 government that almost every single political prisoners escape from the central jail in @entity12 , " @entity143 said			1
@entity2 's @entity157 contributed to this report .			0
