@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity4 's @entity3 has released files on @entity7 sightings dating back to the 1970s , including witness accounts and the government 's response			1
the ministry on wednesday released the files as part of a four - year project to transfer all of the @entity7 documents to the @entity15 to make them available to curious members of the public			1
the documents include hundreds of police reports taken from witnesses who describe seeing lights or strange objects in the sky , from southern @entity0 and @entity24 up to @entity25			1
the files released wednesday cover 1978 to 1987			1
the rest , dating from the 1950s and covering recent history , will be released over the coming years			1
reported sightings typically describe various shapes and colors of lights , moving in formation or hovering in the sky			1
witnesses reported orange , red , white and green lights that were diamond - shaped , square , or cigar - shaped			2
they reported them to police , who have a standard 16 - question form specifically for @entity7 sightings			1
" the vast majority of them are just ordinary people who 've seen something unusual and thought that they ought to tell someone about it , " said @entity43 , a professor at @entity44 and a @entity7 expert who worked with the @entity15 on the project			1
in one sighting in january 1985 , a man near @entity54 , @entity24 , was closing his living room curtains when he saw an object in the sky			2
he said it moved " up and down like a bouncing ball , " then disappeared behind a mountain			2
two police officers in @entity64 , south of @entity65 , reported seeing a white light in the sky on christmas morning 1985			2
the light , they said , moved into the nearby area of @entity70 , where author @entity71 had placed the @entity73 landing in his book , " @entity74			2
" the person who took the report noted the officers were aware of the connection , writing , " genuine report			2
two competent officers slightly embarrassed ( @entity81 features in @entity71 )			2
" two other police officers in @entity83 , @entity65 , reported seeing an object in the sky in june 1984			0
they viewed it with binoculars for an hour and sketched a picture , showing a white sphere with a ring of blue and red lights			0
" the object moved erratically from side to side , up and down and to and fro , not venturing far from its original position , " the officers wrote			0
other reports came from stunned members of the public , pilots , and members of the military			0
the @entity3 said it examined the reports and held onto the records solely to determine whether enemy aircraft had infiltrated @entity4 airspace			1
once it was determined that no enemy aircraft were in the sky , it did not investigate further			1
watch why the ministry is revealing what it knows about @entity7 Â» " the @entity3 has no other interest or role regarding @entity7 matters and does not consider questions regarding the existence or otherwise of extraterrestrial life - forms , " it said wednesday			1
that leaves many of the incidents simply unexplained , such as an april 1984 report made by a senior air traffic controller at an unidentified airfield			0
the controller was bringing in a light aircraft for landing when he noticed a series of lights appearing to come down on another runway			1
the crew of the incoming plane radioed that they saw the lights , too			0
all reported that they saw the lights come down " at speed , " touch down , and disappear			0
" they were so concerned about this , they filed an official report , " @entity43 said			0
" but what was the thing that they saw ? there 's no evidence from the papers that any further investigations were done and it remains a mystery			1
" in 1979 , two years after @entity149 's alien - visitation movie " @entity152 , " reports of strange sightings had increased and the @entity153 decided to hold a debate on @entity7			1
one of the documents released wednesday is a detailed briefing prepared by the @entity3 for the debate , and it sheds light on the military 's position on the matter			1
" there is nothing to indicate that ufology ( the study of @entity7 ) is anything but claptrap and no evidence at all of ' alien space craft , ' " read the briefing , prepared by the ministry for @entity169 , then government chief whip			1
at least one report in the files has since been explained , however			2
a report from august 1985 details the crop circles that two army officers found in a wheat field in @entity180 , in southern @entity0			0
they noted one large circle surrounded by four smaller ones , all perfectly round with the wheat pressed down in a clockwise direction			0
no tracks led up to the circles , they said			0
the farmer called the army officers because he thought the @entity191 had created the circles , but the officers said they were stumped			0
" none of us could offer any reasonable explanation , " they wrote			0
it is now known that the crop circles were some of many created by two hoaxers named @entity200 and @entity201 , according to @entity43			0
" @entity200 and @entity201 , " as they were called , came forward in 1990 to say they created the circles with a garden roller and planks of wood , @entity43 said			0
" we now know that this particular circle near @entity180 was one of the ones that was created as a hoax by these two men , " he said .			0
