-- @entity2 entertainment president @entity1 says he 's going to take a look at the long - gestating @entity4 now that the @entity6 deal to acquire @entity7 is complete			1
" we 'd love to do something with @entity7 , we 're not sure what yet , " @entity1 exclusively told @entity0			1
" we have n't even sat down with them			0
we 're going to look at [ the live - action series ] , we 're going to look at all of them , and see what 's right			1
we were n't able to discuss this with them until [ the acquisition ] closed and it just closed			0
it 's definitely going to be part of the conversation			2
" even many working in @entity22 do n't realize a live - action @entity24 tv series has been sitting on the shelf the past few years			2
the project was commissioned by longtime @entity7 producer @entity28 , who enlisted writers such as " @entity31 's " @entity30 and swore them to @entity33 secrecy on the plot details ( more on the show 's storyline below )			1
@entity28 once called the scripts the most " provocative , bold and daring material that we 've ever done			1
" and then ... nothing			0
the scripts gathered dust , the scope of the production and the extent of the show 's necessary visual effects deemed too expensive for a broadcast or cable network			2
the president of one premium cable outlet told me last summer the project just did n't make any financial sense			2
the closest comparison was @entity58 's lavish " @entity57			2
" but that deal gave @entity58 control of a major chunk of the " thrones " empire , including dvd and international distribution which significantly offset the show 's high production cost			2
the @entity24 show was budgeted at more than $ 5 million per episode and @entity7 wanted to retain ownership			1
' breaking @entity71 -- part 1 ' : unseen scene ! but now @entity6 has purchased @entity7 for $ 4 billion and @entity6 owns more than a couple tv networks			1
the financials for a big - budget tv show are more compelling if the license fee and other income sources stay in the family			0
already one @entity24 - related project is in the works for kids network @entity81			1
@entity84 's popular and innovative animated title @entity85 will likely shift to @entity81 after its current deal expires			0
could the live - action show finally see the light of day too ? it 's a tricky question because a new @entity24 film is planned for 2015			1
cautious brand managers are sometimes reluctant to have a live - action tv show on the air when producing live - action films â € ” such as @entity96 putting the kibosh on any @entity99 tv projects while making @entity101 's trilogy			1
@entity1 said he was n't sure if the project was still viable			1
" it 's going to be very much up to the @entity7 brands how they want to play it , " he said			1
" we got to a point here with @entity110 , a very special point , where we 're in the @entity112 , and very relevantly so , but we 're not doing " @entity113			0
" but " @entity115 " is part of @entity113			0
so maybe something oblique is the way to [ approach the @entity118 ] rather than going straight head - on at it			0
" sources say the live - action series centers on the story of rival families struggling over the control of the seedy underside of the @entity118 and the people who live within the subterranean level and air shafts of the metropolis planet @entity131 ( the @entity133 's urban - sprawl - covered home planet )			1
a bounty hunter may be the main character			0
set between the original @entity24 film trilogy and the prequels , the time period allows for all sorts of potential appearances from classic figures from the @entity118			0
' @entity142 ' : 12 best ' @entity144 ' lines extensive art work including character designs , costume designs , and set designs were all developed by a top team of concept artists and designers who worked for more than a year on the third floor design studio at @entity156 's @entity155 's main house on the project			1
the team was closely supervised by @entity28 and @entity156			2
if all this sounds vaguely familiar , it might be because this roughly matches the description of the upcoming @entity24 videogame " 1313			0
" in fact , sources say story materials and the designs for the tv project were used to help make the game			0
so if you want to see what the tv show was supposed to look like , check out art from " 1313 " ( one example above )			0
this creative strip - mining could arguably help the tv show 's chances â € ” it 's not like @entity22 has been shy about doing crossovers between videogames and films before			2
can you imagine that ultra-hypothetical @entity2 sunday - night lineup ? @entity183 , @entity24 : " 1313 " and " @entity115 " ? see the original article at @entity0			0
