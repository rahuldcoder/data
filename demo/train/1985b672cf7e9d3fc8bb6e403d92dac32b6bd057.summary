-- a year ago in an interview with @entity0 's @entity3 , i said it would take a difference - maker , a @entity6 or a @entity8 - like figure , to stand up for what is right and break the ice so real progress can be made in the battle for equality in professional sports			1
twelve shorts months later , we get to meet that courageous person , the one who is creating positive change and breaking down barriers before our very eyes			0
like @entity6 or @entity8 , @entity21 is a difference - maker			1
never before has there been an openly gay player active on a roster in the three biggest professional sports leagues -- @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29			1
with his decision to come out publicly as he begins his professional football career , @entity21 will forever be seen as an iconic figure to professional athletes and the @entity36 community			2
he is a bold spirit who has just accelerated the process of acceptance of homosexuals in professional sports			1
is the @entity27 ready for a gay player ? truthfully , it does n't matter			1
there will , however , be players , fans and organizations who directly or indirectly express their ignorant , homophobic and antiquated views on homosexuality			0
as a former professional athlete , i can imagine what it is like to anticipate receiving the league 's first openly gay player , and it should be a great honor for any player to gain @entity21 as a teammate			1
it would allow them to be a part of this movement into a new era			0
conversely , there will be players such as @entity66 who will express concern about how to respond if gay teammates tried to look at them while they are naked in the locker room or shower			0
there will be baleful fans who hide behind screen names in chat rooms and on @entity75 and @entity76 who " shout " in all caps hateful , derogatory and homophobic slurs at gay athletes			0
this type of person matters not , and they should just continue to be ignored and remain as nameless , faceless , irrelevant cowards			0
there may be @entity27 teams who will not draft @entity21 in the upcoming draft now			1
you may hear that some general managers of @entity27 teams think that a gay player would be a distraction for the team			1
when you hear these types of comments , just chuckle and remember that the @entity97 finished the 2013 season ranked no. 5 in the nation , went 12 - 2 in the @entity101 , or @entity101 ( arguably the best conference in all of college football ) , while their star player , @entity21 , was named @entity105 , @entity101 co-defensive player of the year -- and he happened to be gay			1
@entity21 told his team about his sexuality before the 2013 season , and i am blown away by the incredible example that has been set by his teammates , his head coach @entity113 , and the entire @entity115 football staff			2
they embraced him , supported him , rallied behind him and respected him enough to let him come out to the public on his own terms			0
their example is a microcosm of what homosexuality in sports can and will be			2
will @entity21 's decision to come out before the @entity27 draft have a negative effect on his draft status ? perhaps , but if teams pass on @entity21 because of his sexual orientation , they did not deserve him			1
courageous difference - makers deserve to be surrounded by bold , brave and like - minded leaders			1
i reiterate : it will be a boon to gain @entity21 as a teammate			2
many of us grew up in households where we learned that that everyone is created equally , but as we discovered the world and some of the ignorant and hateful people in it , we learned that everyone is not treated equally			0
history shows us that many groups were unjustifiably treated differently			0
it is baffling and unthinkable today that some " minority groups " were ostracized and mistreated because of their race , religion , gender , height , handedness , and even because of their birthmarks			0
complete acceptance of homosexuals in professional sports will not come easy			2
there will be much backlash and discussion			0
some will call @entity21 " crazy " for coming out			2
but the same adjective could have been used to describe some of the greatest minds and difference - makers the world has ever known			1
@entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 and many others have stood up for what is right , and the rest of us have benefited			0
we can all contribute to our society as the greats before us have , but to do so , we have to be willing to smash the status quo and perhaps be called " crazy			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity180			2

@entity180 : in battle for equality in sports , @entity21 is a difference - maker
he says by coming out , the @entity27 prospect accelerated acceptance of gays in sports
he was a star player with the fifth - ranked @entity97 and says his team stood behind him
wire : the time has come for this ; ignorance can be overcome .
