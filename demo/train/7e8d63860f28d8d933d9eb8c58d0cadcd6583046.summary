@entity20 , 25 , is being sued in civil court by a woman named @entity23			1
@entity20 told investigators that was the name of her 2 - year - old daughter @entity4 's nanny , and that the woman had taken the girl and disappeared			1
investigators were never able to find evidence such a woman existed , but were able to find @entity23 , who denied knowing @entity20 or her daughter			1
