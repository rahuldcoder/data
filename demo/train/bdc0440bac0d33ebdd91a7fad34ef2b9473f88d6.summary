-- @entity2 's presidential race has been a political roller coaster			1
after banning 10 candidates earlier this month , the country 's election commission banned and unbanned this week yet another well - known candidate , former prime minister @entity7 , although the constitutional court is still reviewing that decision			1
the remaining front - runners for president speak a similar language on the need for economic reform and political transition , but they hold very different positions on the role of @entity18 in a new @entity2			1
in this sense , the presidential election will be an important indicator of how much weight @entity2 give to @entity18 as a factor in their political life			1
it will not be the only factor in their decision , which will no doubt turn on questions of personality and name recognition as much as anything			0
but a vote for a candidate with more conservative @entity36 leanings -- and there is evidence of strong support for such candidates -- will likely influence the writing of the constitution , with potential for a long - lasting impact on the rights of minorities and women in particular			1
with only a month until the vote , and with the slate of potential candidates in such flux , it is not surprising that concerns are growing about the credibility and fairness of the elections			0
the recent disqualifications of former intelligence chief @entity58 , @entity60 preacher @entity59 , and the @entity62 's @entity61 have fueled charges that @entity2 's military rulers are trying to manipulate the election from behind the scenes to deliver a candidate suitable to their interests			1
according to the latest @entity71 poll , conducted after the disqualification of @entity58 , @entity59 , and @entity73 , the front - runner now is clearly @entity74 , with support among voters of roughly 40 %			1
@entity74 is very likely the military 's choice at this point			0
a former diplomat who served as secretary general of the @entity82 , he is an establishment figure who has vowed to give the military a voice in key policy decisions through a national security council that would include top military officers			0
@entity74 's election , however , is far from a done deal			0
the big swing factor is the @entity36 vote			2
@entity74 , a secularist , has said that @entity2 can not afford an " experiment " in @entity18 democracy at this time			1
yet more than 70 % of voters in the parliamentary election last fall opted for @entity36 candidates			2
with the rejection of @entity73 , the @entity62 candidate is now @entity102 , 60 , who represents the older , more conservative wing of the @entity62 and openly endorses a strict @entity18 vision , which will appeal to the @entity60 vote			1
@entity102 has called for a council of @entity18 scholars to review whether state laws are in accordance with @entity111 law , although he has said the council 's decisions need not be binding			1
@entity115 , in contrast , stuck to a pragmatic , economic - oriented message and stressed his support for tolerance and democracy			0
voters will likely find the @entity62 's claims of support for pluralism less plausible under @entity102 's banner			1
but the @entity62 has strongly thrown its weight behind @entity102 , telling its broad base of followers that they must vote for him , and many will do so			2
the other leading @entity36 is @entity131 , a charismatic doctor who rose to national attention in 1977 when he publicly chastised former president @entity133 at a public forum at @entity135			0
@entity131 , popular among the younger generation of @entity62 members , has over the years become increasingly critical of the @entity62 's conservative stances			2
when the party published a platform in 2007 , drafted by @entity102 , @entity131 spoke out against controversial provisions excluding non-muslims and women from the presidency			0
in 2009 , @entity131 was purged from his leadership position in the @entity62			0
he was kicked out of the party last year when he declared his candidacy for president			0
although @entity131 remains an @entity36 , on the stump he focuses on justice and pragmatic economic issues and appears dismissive of talk of @entity18 law			2
despite all the political turmoil , it seems likely that @entity2 's election will go forward next month , and voters will be faced with relatively clear choices			0
while it is possible that @entity36 voters will throw their weight behind @entity74 , perhaps out of name recognition or in hopes of a return to stability , others will inevitably lean toward an @entity36 candidate			2
a vote for @entity102 will consolidate the @entity62 's political influence , which could translate into a constitution with weaker provisions for protection of minority and women 's rights			1
if @entity131 emerges as the winner , it will be a sign that @entity2 are interested in a more pluralistic agenda within an @entity18 framework			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			0

@entity181 says @entity2 vote a roller coaster ; *unclear* how big a role @entity18 will play
@entity189 's disqualifications of candidates raise question about election 's fairness , she says
she says secularist @entity195 , a front - runner , faces *challenge* from @entity36 candidate
@entity200 : votes for @entity62 's @entity102 could mean *trouble* for minorities , women
