, and @entity5 - winning wildlife cameraman and apex predator expert @entity4 , who 's worked on 13 @entity3 specials , will have been involved in at least two of them			1
here , he tells us how he 's able to free - dive with great whites , what we should do if we find ourselves swimming with a curious one ( swim toward it ? ! ) , and the story of why he was once chased to the surface by a 10 - footer			1
@entity0 : you 're known for getting outside the cage with great whites so you can capture angles tv audiences have n't seen a million times before			1
how do you tell if sharks , in general , are n't in the mood to be filmed ? @entity4 : the smaller sharks will arch their back , drop their fins , and swim in weird postures			1
if you do n't have experience with sharks , you might not read those signs			1
they 'll get close to you , dart away , and then come back — mock charges where they 're essentially trying to scare you or let you know , hey , i 'm pissed off , and if you keep swimming at me with your camera , i 'm gon na bite you or whatever i can bite			1
they 're built like pit bulls on steroids			1
they can bend their fins here and there , but their way of showing they 're angry is they open and close their mouth			1
so they just show you the jaws sign			1
they swim right at you and gape			1
@entity0 : so a great white is swimming at you opening and closing its mouth			2
what do you do ? @entity4 : you ca n't swim away immediately because then you 're acting like prey and they 're like , oh , cool			1
that 's something i 'm gon na eat			1
the best thing that i 've found to do sounds counterintuitive , but you swim right at them			2
you always keep eye contact , and you swim directly at the shark , and that seems to trigger a defense mechanism			1
now they 're like , wait a second , everything in the ocean swims away from me aside from orcas , which are known to occasionally kill white sharks			1
everyone says punch a shark in the nose : the problem with that is that water refracts and magnifies things , so if you go to punch a shark in the nose and you think its nose is right here , it 's not , it 's back here , and as you follow through , your hand goes straight into its mouth			1
their eyes and their gills are the most sensitive things			2
but the reality is , if you do n't act like prey , they wo n't treat you like prey			2
you do n't want to swim away while they 're watching you			2
as they swim away , you swim away , and try to get back on the boat , open up a @entity99 , say , ' oh , that was fun , ' and downplay it			2
@entity0 : your website has a shot of a great white face - to - face with you , with just your camera separating you			2
how often does that happen ? @entity4 : whether it 's the electronics in the camera or the fact that they 're just really inquisitive , they almost always swim straight up to the camera and either bump it with their snout , or , the more investigative ones , decide to bite it			1
i 've said before it 's like you 're eating a bowl of spaghetti and you accidentally bite down on your fork			1
most sane people do n't try to continue to bite through that fork and swallow it			2
they immediately let go and realize wow , that 's something that 's not natural for me to eat , so they do n't eat it			1
@entity0 : what 's the most dangerous situation you 've found yourself in over the years			1
@entity4 : i try not to tell it			1
i had one situation [ filming 2010 's into the @entity131 ] where i was essentially running out of air , and i had to go to the surface , and i was out of the cage with great whites			1
like i said , if you swim away from them , they pursue you			2
i was breaking my own rule of do n't act like prey or they 'll treat you like prey			2
i had one relatively curious juvenile great white , and the juveniles are like puppy dogs			2
they want to swim up and put their paws on everything			2
the bigger ones , they 've been around			2
they know what boats are			2
they know what people are			2
they 're cautious , and that 's the reason why they 've gotten so big			1
they 're mature enough to understand that they 're not the only dangerous thing out there			2
but this little shark , it did n't really want to come and play with me either — it seemed like it wanted to bite me			0
i was interacting with it on the bottom , and it kept coming up doing the mock charging and bumping into the camera , and i 'd bump it , and it 'd swim away and come back			0
well , i bumped it one last time , and i started to swim up			0
it was swimmin ' away , but it knew that i was swimming up , so it immediately turned around			0
it was the first time i actually witnessed a great white stalking and then attempting an ambush vertical approach from underwater			0
i saw this little shark — little as in , like , a 10 - footer — coming up at me , and i saw its little white chin wagging			0
it was accelerating toward me			0
i 'm like ... uh , holy s —			0
i just relied on my standard instinct of using the camera , keeping the camera between me and the shark			0
the shark came up with its mouth open , and as i finned back , it sort of went past me and i hit it on the side on its gills			0
that time , when i hit its gills , it seemed to finally respond like , s — , that thing is dangerous			0
i kept an eye on it and kept finning , and i saw it circling back again			1
they 're just like teenagers			0
they do n't really know any better , and they 're really curious			0
but when a great white shark is curious , it can be catastrophic			0
luckily , i was able to get back to the boat , drink my @entity99 , and everything was cool			0
that is one thing that happens : when you get really caught up when you 're filming and you 're getting amazing stuff , especially on the bottom , you can forget about your air supply			0
once again , it was n't really the shark that put me in danger , it was myself			0
i was running out of air and created this predator - prey relationship where i became the prey and the shark just gave chase			0
if i did n't run out of air , i could have slowly ascended			0
the shark would have come up , circled around me , bumped some more			0
if you do things slowly and methodically , they respond that way as well			0
if you have to kick up because you 're running out of air and you 're freaked out now because he 's coming after you ... @entity0 : i now want to see that footage			1
@entity4 : i was filming			1
on my camera , it 's not as impressive as if someone was filming what was happening			1
underwater , you do n't zoom a lot , because when you zoom , it flattens the image and it does n't look good			0
so when you 're with great whites , you 're always really wide because they 're massive animals and they come right up to the lens all the time			0
@entity0 : did you have another diver with you that day ? @entity4 : i did have @entity244 [ an expert on @entity246 's shark diving sites ] with me			1
there was another situation that happened with @entity244 , just before this			0
@entity244 saw the shark f — ing with me , and @entity244 swam over and was trying to tell the shark , like , chill out			0
but @entity244 is scuba diving			0
he does n't have a camera , he 's got nothing in his hands			1
i might have this shot somewhere : the shark swims up at @entity244			1
@entity244 swims at the shark like i was saying you do			1
but instead of backing down , the shark just keeps swimming			0
the shark is opening his mouth and all @entity244 can do is [ makes motion like you 're pressing yourself flat against a wall ] as the shark goes by			0
if he would have put his hands out , the shark would have bit his hands			0
so i did have @entity244 , but @entity244 is a crazy f — ing person			0
i 'm a bit of a dare - devil , but i do n't want to win a @entity269			0
like if my family can read my obituary and laugh because it 's embarrassing , that 's not a good thing			1
