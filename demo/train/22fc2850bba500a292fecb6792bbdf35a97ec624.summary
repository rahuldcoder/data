it 's a truth of warfare in the digital era : bullets and bombs often are augmented by status updates and tweets			0
the bloody conflict taking place in @entity9 is no different			2
and @entity10 , or @entity10 , a terror group so extreme that @entity12 has denounced it , is taking the lead with a social media propaganda war the likes of which has never been seen			1
from recruiting fighters to spreading word of their violent attacks , @entity10 is taking to the web in what analysts say is a more sophisticated manner than previous combatants			1
perhaps as a result , @entity9 have been reporting widespread outages of social sites , a common refrain during recent unrest in the @entity30 and elsewhere			1
@entity32 's @entity31 in @entity33 interviewed a defector from @entity10 who said he used to recruit @entity35 for the cause through direct messages on @entity38			1
opinion : will @entity10 brutality backfire ? " there was special treatment for the @entity43			2
one @entity49 guy said he was called @entity50 , then told me he was from @entity51 , " said the man , who said he left the movement after it killed two of his relatives			0
" one asked my boss if he should fight in his own country or come to @entity54			0
he was told , ' if @entity55 does n't give you martyrdom in @entity54 , ' then he could wage war in his own country			0
" the man , now in hiding , said he was part of a team that ran an online chat welcoming new recruits to @entity10			1
" there are things i am allowed to answer and things i must ask my supervisor about , " he said			0
" specific questions about religion -- i have to get their permission to message anyone			0
i ca n't talk on @entity73			0
everything is written down so they can monitor everything			0
" as the @entity80 group 's fight has moved from @entity54 to @entity9 , that savvy web strategy has expanded to include online video posts much slicker than the grainy , shaky clips that have popped up from @entity12 and other terror groups			1
recently , a slickly produced , hourlong @entity10 video titled " @entity85 of the @entity86 " surfaced , showcasing killings , roadside bombings and other acts of terror for which @entity10 claimed credit			1
the video vividly displays these scenes in a style reminiscent of @entity95 efforts like " the @entity96 " and " @entity97 , " complete with elaborate aerial shots			0
" this is funded , " said @entity99 , a @entity30 analyst			0
there is money behind it			0
it 's not just idiots ; these idiots have somebody controlling them and providing them with equipment that is very expensive			0
you ca n't just get it in a cave			0
" on another front , at least one analyst says @entity10 was recently using a mobile app made available in @entity116 's @entity115 to inflate its presence on social media			1
called @entity120 of @entity121 , or just @entity122 , the app was promoted as a way to keep up to date with news from @entity10			1
according to @entity126 , editor of national - security blog @entity127 , the @entity122 app would post updates to users ' @entity38 feeds			1
by midafternoon tuesday , @entity116 appeared to have removed the app from its store			1
@entity116 did not immediately reply to a message seeking comment for this story			2
with the digital assault accompanying a ground offensive that saw @entity10 fighting tuesday just 40 miles north of @entity139 in the city of @entity141 , access to social media has been disappearing across much of @entity9			1
there has been no confirmation that the @entity9 government is behind a blackout			2
but both @entity148 and @entity38 have reported a precipitous drop in the number of people in @entity9 using their products in the past few days			1
" users in # @entity9 are reporting issues accessing our service			2
we 're investigating their reports and we hope service will be restored quickly , " @entity38 said on its global policy team 's account friday			1
@entity148 has issued a similar statement			0
" we are disturbed by reports of access issues in @entity9 and are investigating			2
limiting access to internet services — essential for communication and commerce for millions of people — is a matter of concern for the global community , " read a @entity148 statement sent to @entity32			0
@entity148 's internal numbers show that , since june 12 , the volume of visits to its site and apps were as low as 30 % of their normal volume in @entity9			2
there are no technical problems on its end , @entity148 said			0
web software firm @entity183 reports that visits to @entity38 in @entity9 dramatically plummeted early saturday			1
a @entity38 spokesman said its internal traffic reports mirror @entity183 's			2
@entity9 have increasingly turned to @entity189 , a mobile app that lets users post anonymous images , in an apparent effort to get around the social - media issues			1
@entity195 , @entity189 's editor in chief , told @entity197 that whisper usage in @entity9 more than doubled between june 12 and june 15			2
during @entity201 uprisings in places like @entity203 and @entity204 , as well as more recent conflicts in places like @entity54 , unrest has been met with @entity208 outages and the blocking of social media sites			1
in virtually all cases , the opposition has accused sitting governments , who control their nation 's internet infrastructure , of blocking access to make coordination more difficult and keep news of the conflicts from spreading			0
