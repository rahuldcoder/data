@entity0 says she can accept anything : even that her youngest son committed suicide -- if it 's proven and explained to her			0
however , she says , local and state investigators have done neither to support their theory that @entity6 hanged himself one summer night			1
" that 's all i 've ever asked for : what is due , owed rightfully to me and my family -- justice			0
prove to me what happened to my child , " @entity6 says			1
she says she 's long lost confidence in the @entity16 and the @entity17			0
now , the @entity18 is looking into @entity6 's death and the local and state investigations that followed			1
without clear answers , the past few months without him have not been easy			0
" i look for him and i do n't see him			0
i listen for him and i do n't hear him , " @entity6 says			1
the last time @entity6 saw and heard her son was august 28			1
@entity6 , 17 , played the lineman position for the @entity28 , and was focused on football			1
his family says that night , he packed a gym bag , washed his ankle brace and hung it on the clothesline to dry before heading out for an evening walk			1
the teen had asthma , his mother says , and a doctor had recommended he exercise outdoors at night when the temperature and humidity dropped			1
around 10:30 , @entity6 left his family 's small apartment and headed down a dirt road			1
his family never saw him alive again			0
just before 7:30 the next morning , he was found hanging from the frame of a swing set in the center of a mobile home community			1
according to medical documents , his body was covered in fire ants			0
@entity6 's mother was called to the scene several hours later , after he 'd been placed into a body bag			1
it was like a dream			0
it was like i was not seeing what i was seeing , " @entity6 says			1
immediately , @entity6 believed her son 's death was the result of some foul play			1
" he did n't do this to himself , " @entity6 says			1
she believes @entity6 was lynched			1
" he may have either been strangled somewhere else or been placed there or he was hung there while people were around watching him die , " @entity6 's older brother , @entity67 says			1
however , @entity74 's chief medical examiner dr. @entity73 declared his death a suicide			1
when a state investigator asked @entity6 if her son had been depressed recently , she told them he had -- because a relative had died recently			1
the state medical examiner cited that exchange in the autopsy report			0
@entity6 says she did not mean that her son had been suffering from depression			1
" when you just lose someone close to you , you 're going to be depressed , upset , in mourning , " @entity6 says			1
the family says @entity6 had not changed his routine and was focused on college and football -- and distracted by his girlfriend			1
the teen had been dating a 31 - year - old white neighbor			0
the age of consent in @entity74 is 16			0
some people in their small , southern town did not like that the two were together			0
@entity6 did not like their drastic age difference			1
" i was shocked , disappointed			0
i also , initially told him how i felt - that i did not approve of it , " @entity6 says			1
in the wake of his death , some wondered whether @entity6 had been killed because he was in an interracial relationship			1
a week after @entity6 was buried , a local teenager was arrested for defacing his grave			2
" there are too many questions and it very well could be a lynching or a staged lynching			0
we do n't know -- but what we do know is there has to be a serious and full investigation of these matters , " says rev. @entity113 , a national board member for the @entity114			0
the @entity114 hired @entity121 - based forensic pathologist @entity120 to analyze the case and dr. @entity73 's autopsy , completed for the state			0
@entity120 ' first concern : basic physics			0
@entity6 was 5 - foot - 9			2
the crossbar of the swing set frame he was found hanging from was 7 - foot - 6 , according to the @entity114 review			1
with no swings or anything at the scene on which he could have climbed , according to the review , it 's unclear how @entity6 reached the top			2
" his size , his stature does not add up to him being capable of constructing all of this alone - in the dark , " @entity6 's brother says			2
according to the 911 recording and the initial police report , a 52 - year - old woman got the 207 - pound teen down , while she was on the phone with an emergency dispatcher			0
" dr. @entity73 also noted that she was not provided with photographs or dimensions of the swing set			0
without this information , she would be unable to evaluate the ability to create this scenario , " according to the @entity114 review			0
@entity6 says she told investigators that the belts used to fashion the noose did not belong to @entity6			2
" i know every piece and every stitch of clothes this child has -- i buy them , i know			0
those were not his belts , " @entity6 says			2
the @entity164 and medical examiner @entity165 believed the belts might have been dog leashes			0
@entity73 thought that " some portion must be missing because there was no secondary cut in either belt			0
the cut would have been necessary to bring down @entity6 's body , " according to the review			2
also , the shoes @entity6 was wearing when his body was found were not his , according to his family			1
@entity6 's brother says he left home that night wearing size 12 @entity181 's			1
however , he was found wearing size 10.5 @entity183 shoes			0
those shoes were not with @entity6 's body when he arrived at the state medical examiner 's office , according to the @entity114 review			2
" he 's going to walk a quarter mile from his house in a pair of shoes that 's two sizes too small after he takes off his new pair of shoes - and this is a 17 - year - old black kid with a brand new pair of @entity181 's on			2
he 's going to take those @entity181 's off and just get rid of them and put on some shoes that 's not his -- we do n't know where he got them from , no laces in them -- and continue to walk down this dirt road late at night to a swing set in the middle of the trailer park and hang himself , " @entity198 says			2
" how can i believe that ? " @entity198 added			0
there are also questions about who first declared @entity6 's death a suicide			1
" dr. @entity73 noted that her determination of ( manner of death ) in this case as suicide was based on the information she was provided by law enforcement and the local medical examiner			2
she would have likely called the ( manner of death ) ' pending ' while awaiting toxicology and investigation but the ( local medical examiner ) had already signed the ( manner of death ) as suicide , " according to the @entity114 review			2
however , in the summary of the case , written the day @entity6 was found , the local medical examiner asked " did he hang self ? will autopsy tell us ? " @entity165 also left the conclusion on the manner of death " pending			1
" local police and state investigators declined to speak with @entity239			0
@entity239 asked to interview @entity73 about the statements attributed to her in the @entity114 review			0
instead , a department spokesperson confirmed the exchanges through a written statement : " the comments that were released by the @entity114 were a synopsis of a professional exchange between the @entity114 's independently - retained forensic pathologist and dr. @entity73 , " according to a spokesperson for the @entity74 @entity250			0
@entity6 's family believes there was a rush to judgment			2
and until someone clearly explains and proves how her son died , @entity6 says she 'll keep fighting until she gets answers			2
" i take it one day at a time			0
that 's all i can say , " @entity6 says .			0
