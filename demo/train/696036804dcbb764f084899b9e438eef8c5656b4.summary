-- @entity1 , the embattled @entity2 running back , told @entity4 in an interview on the " today " show that " the only thing i can hope for and wish for is a second chance			1
" @entity1 was captured on film delivering a knock - out punch to his fiancee , now wife , in an @entity13 hotel elevator			1
i do n't think he should get that second chance he is asking for			2
domestic violence is an outright attack against women -- individually and as a gender			1
while i know from 30 years of experience as a criminal defense attorney that domestic violence is not limited to female victims , the overwhelming percentage of domestic violence events are men using their physical strength to overpower women			1
it is an insidious assault upon our mothers , sisters , girlfriends and wives			0
as a society , we tolerate far too much of this type of abuse			0
we can not tolerate it any longer , especially from celebrated public figures			0
they may not all deserve it , but celebrities are idolized in this country			2
from @entity44 actors to sports heroes and recording artists , we have created an extraordinarily special class amongst us			0
great benefit and great advantage comes with such celebrity , and whether they like it or not , great responsibility comes as well			2
sometimes , celebrities fail to live up to their responsibilities			0
rather than forgiving the dalliances and sins of those whom we have made demigods , we owe it to our children ( the ones who are looking up to these demigods ) to hold their heroes ' feet to the fire and send a clear message			0
if we are going to pay somebody tens of millions of dollars to make movies , play sports or perform on stage , then we should also let them know that the privilege we have granted can be easily revoked if they fail to act responsibly			0
@entity77 brass admits ' crucial mistake ' in punishment of @entity1 @entity1 made himself a celebrity when he accepted a $ 35 million dollar contract with an @entity77 football team			1
when he punched his fiancee in the face and dragged her unconscious body out of a hotel elevator , he violated a public trust , and he should n't be allowed to play football for the @entity77 anymore			2
admittedly , this zero tolerance policy argument flies in the face of the mitigation that i always argue on behalf of my criminal clients , but most criminal clients are not role models to millions of fans			0
just like @entity97 , who was stripped of his ownership of the @entity99 for making racist remarks , @entity1 should learn that if you 're going to bear the fruit , then you must also bear the burden			1
when we tell domestic abusers such as @entity1 , in such a public way , that it 's ok to knock out your wife and drag her out of an elevator , then we are telling everyone it 's ok			1
we 're telling the young boys and teenagers who wear @entity1 jerseys that hitting women is ok			1
well , it 's not ok .			0

@entity118 : @entity1 wants a second chance after video showed him punching fiancee
@entity118 : he does n't deserve one ; domestic violence is attack on all women , ca n't be tolerated
he says with celebrity comes responsibility ; kids must learn heroes do n't get a *slide*
