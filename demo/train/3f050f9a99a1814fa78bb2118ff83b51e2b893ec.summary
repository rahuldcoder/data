@entity0 wants rich people in @entity2 to give more to charity and he 'll do anything to get their attention			1
that includes stacking piles of cash to form a wall for a photo op or dancing on the rooftops of brand new cars that he bought for a donation			0
@entity0 's latest stunt involved buying lunch for underprivileged people in @entity19 and giving each person a cash gift			1
the free lunch took place on june 25 at @entity24 in @entity24			0
" i have visited the @entity26 every month since last november , i see many homeless people , poor people on the streets , searching for food in the garbage bins , " @entity0 said when asked why he was going all the way to the @entity26 to carry out his philanthropy			1
calling from his @entity33 office earlier this week , @entity0 spoke in an even , calm tone , without a hint of the goofball persona that he displays during his media events			1
@entity0 publicized the mass lunch with full - page ads in the @entity41 and @entity42 , asking interested homeless people to sign up for the meal by email			1
when we spoke to the millionaire , he said more than 5,000 people had signed up for the june 25 lunch			2
he was working with several @entity26 charities to decide on the final guest list			0
one of them , the @entity19 @entity53 , told @entity54 last week that the $ 300 cash gift is a prize for completing one of their training or substance abuse programs			0
publicity with a purpose mission spokeswoman @entity63 dismissed the idea that the event is a publicity stunt for @entity0 , saying they had vetted him			1
" it 's not something we wanted to get into lightly , " she said , citing her organization 's 142 - year history			2
but for @entity0 , publicity is crucial			2
handing out cash and buying lunches is not the long - term goal			0
the eccentric millionaire says he hopes to influence the rest of the world 's rich and powerful to give more through his flashy charity antics , even though it makes him a target for ridicule			1
" my wealth is very limited			0
i need to influence other people to give , " says @entity0 , adding that those full - page ads in @entity26 newspapers were written in both @entity89 and @entity2 so that other well - heeled @entity2 would get the message			1
the tycoon founded @entity93 , an unlisted company that recycles construction material and domestic waste , but says that he " could not even make it onto @entity2 's top 10,000 rich list			2
" @entity98 has him at number 372 on their 2013 rich list , while @entity101 reports @entity0 's fortune is worth the equivalent of $ 720 million ( rmb4.5 billion )			1
' talk is cheap ' @entity0 likes to tell the story of how his mother 's selflessness inspired him			1
growing up in a poor rural household , two of @entity0 's siblings starved to death			1
despite their poverty , his mother found ways to give to others			2
" she would carry my little brother at her side , he would be crying , but she would share her milk with other people 's babies , " says @entity0			1
the self - made man said he did many odd jobs as a school kid , hauling trash , selling water and snacks , whatever he could to bring in extra cash			0
a graduate in traditional @entity2 medicine ( @entity131 ) , @entity0 says he invented an electronic device that detects illnesses in the body using @entity131 theories			2
the contraption made him his first fortune in the 1990s before he turned to the recycling industry			2
he made his mark nationally as a philanthropist when he appeared on the scene of the @entity143 earthquake in 2008			0
changing his suit and tie for army fatigues , the bespectacled businessman pulled bodies out from the rubble and donated more than rmb 100 million ( us $ 16 million )			0
" i like to get my hands dirty			0
talk is cheap , " he says			0
@entity0 has since traveled to the epicenter of other major natural disasters in @entity2 to do relief work -- and provide the media with great photo ops			1
in the spotlight despite his record , a lot of people ca n't take @entity0 seriously as a philanthropist			1
his critics include @entity163 , director of @entity2 media research firm @entity164 , who calls the millionaire " a clown whose so - called philanthropy appears to consist entirely of self - promotional stunts			2
" netizens ridicule @entity0 for his love of the media spotlight ; some accuse him of being a fraud and say that his @entity131 diagnostic machine invented in the 1990s is a scam			1
@entity0 does n't do himself any favors when he includes on his @entity89 namecard an absurdly long string of self - aggrandizing titles , including " @entity180 of @entity2 , " or when he widely publicizes his interest in buying the @entity41 , only to have the @entity41 deny any such possibility			2
the millionaire also seems to actively court political controversy			0
in 2011 , he traveled to @entity185 -- considered a rogue state by @entity187 -- to hand out more than $ 200,000 in cash to the disadvantaged , only to have local politicians hesitate to receive him , suspecting the trip may be a soft political move orchestrated by @entity2 government			2
@entity2 @entity26 media such as the @entity194 and @entity195 have investigated @entity0 's ties to the @entity197 , suspecting him of unknowingly becoming a political pawn for certain factions of the party			1
@entity2 - language media have also accused @entity0 of not fulfilling his million - dollar pledges -- allegations @entity0 has denied			1
@entity0 is a staunch patriot -- he is known for punctuating press conferences with solo renditions of patriotic songs , some using self - penned lyrics			1
he also took out an ad in the @entity41 in 2012 proclaiming the disputed @entity209 are @entity2 territory , not @entity211			0
but the recycling tycoon denies any connection with @entity2 authorities and insists his record is clean			1
" starting my business has been very hard work			0
i have received no help from any officials at all			0
i still find it very difficult to get my business deals because i refuse to take or give bribes , i refuse to become corrupt , " he says			0
perhaps @entity0 's most controversial philanthropic venture was his pledge in early 2014 to fund plastic surgery for a mother and her daughter who reportedly survived self - immolation			1
the pair were allegedly part of a group of @entity233 practitioners who are believed to have set themselves on fire in @entity235 in 2001			0
they survived the incident but were badly disfigured			0
@entity0 's move to bankroll their surgery was met with outrage from @entity233 supporters who say that the incident was staged by the @entity2 government and that the organization would never preach self harm or suicide			1
when he dies , @entity0 plans to donate his entire fortune not to his family , but to charity -- a pledge he says he was inspired to make after meeting @entity252 and @entity253 in 2010			1
although his critics accuse @entity0 of never giving money to his relatives anyway			2
" my younger brother runs a guesthouse and my sister is a janitor			0
i have not given them money because they earn their own money			0
i pay for their children 's school fees , " says @entity0			1
despite the criticism , @entity0 has not been discouraged			1
" i regret nothing , " he says			0
" i am not afraid of what people say about me			2
i have not done anything that harms anyone			0
i think society needs diverse innovation			0
i will keep on giving positive energy through my creative solutions for problems			0

" i regret nothing . i am not afraid of what people say about me , " says controversial philanthropist @entity0
