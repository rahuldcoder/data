cityscapes are usually breathtaking , but finding a good vantage point in a new town can be tough			2
not for on the @entity3 ( @entity4 ) , a loose collective of photographers from @entity7 who have made it their mission to shoot thrilling , often beautiful stills and video from the rooftops of the world 's tallest buildings			1
they 've been reaching the rooftops of the world 's skyscrapers for the past five years , and have shot videos from @entity20 to @entity21 , @entity22 to @entity23			1
once they 're up there , they lean out perilously over edges and free - climb up towers , antenna and cranes , making anyone watching their immensely popular videos , uploaded to video sharing sites @entity35 and @entity36 , as well as their own blog , squirm in their shoes as they marvel at the @entity4 members ' daredevilry			2
their latest stunt , published on @entity36 on october 8 but already boasting well over a million views , shows four of them , identified at the end of the short video as @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 and @entity50 ( not their real names ) , climb a steel ladder onto the roof of a @entity56 skyscraper and hijack a huge @entity58 billboard			1
once they 're done with it , the sign flashes " what 's up @entity56 ? " and shows clips of an earlier exploit , @entity64 and @entity48 climbing the then - uncompleted 2,073 - feet ( 632 - meter ) @entity65			1
no philosophy after successfully taking over the signage , they pose for each other , and for a drone which is circling overhead , shooting the mission			2
they then rush down the stairs and out of the building , triumphant			2
" there 's no philosophy to @entity4 , we are just a small group of photographers , who like exploration , interesting places and some different countries , " @entity48 tells @entity75			2
" actually it 's very simple , i bought a camera and after that i thought , ' maybe i 'll try to climb on rooftops			2
' i took some pictures from the rooftops and thought , ' i like it ' and after that we climbed all around @entity91 , we did a lot of cities and after that we traveled because @entity91 for us was finished and we thought it was n't a bad idea to try something really kind of amazing			1
" he says they 've climbed thousands of buildings in something like 50 countries			1
as well as going up , they also go down , trespassing onto subways and exploring the subterranean sides of the places they visit			0
the first time he went up , @entity48 says he was a " little " scared			0
" yeah a little bit , but now for us it 's like a routine , you know ? it 's very simple			0
we started five years ago and since then we 've climbed so much			1
i 'm usually scared not about heights but about police			0
sometimes we have to break into buildings			2
sometimes if we go to a dangerous country , like an @entity118 country , maybe this is a big problem if police caught us			0
that 's the most scary part			0
" for the most part , the authorities are playing catchup to the rooftop raiders , although security as some landmark buildings , including the 1,227 - feet ( 373.9 - meter ) @entity127 in @entity56 know their faces and to bar them entry			1
he says he does n't worry about being barred from entering countries -- following @entity133 media reports on their @entity65 stunt he thought they might get a 20 - year ban from entering the country , but nothing transpired and they have since revisited @entity133			2
computer hack for the " what 's up @entity56 " mission , he says the hardest part was figuring out the computer program that ran the @entity58 billboard			1
the climb up the 659 - feet ( 201 - meter ) @entity148 in @entity56 's downtown @entity150 district was a fairly routine one , and as for the computer terminal : " we found it there ! it was all a big surprise			1
we did n't know that we could change the sign when ( we ) went up			0
" finding the building , getting to the top was easy , because all the doors were open , we just go inside , find the stairs to the top , after that we found the computer ( terminal ) , opened it up and played with it for two or three hours so this is how we made it play our video			0
" the climbers made headlines last year when they scaled the @entity172 at @entity173 , @entity20 -- and later apologized when they were accused of disrespecting the ancient monuments			0
he says there 's also some skepticism surrounding the veracity of what they 're doing			0
it 's not hard to see why ; some of the footage is mind - blowing			0
" some people say , it 's a nice video , nice action , but some people say it 's a fake			0
maybe 30 % of people think it 's a fake			0
or a lot of people think the @entity56 government gave us permission or money , or we do this stuff legally , but its not true			1
" he says there 's a lot of interest in their work , and despite being apolitical , groups like the organizers of @entity56 's pro-democracy protest movement have contacted them			1
" people in @entity56 messaged us about @entity208 , asking how we could do the same stuff ( as the @entity58 billboard ) with them			1
they wanted a yellow umbrella up there ! " but so far , it 's just the thrill of the climb that keeps him , and his on the @entity3 co-conspirators going			1
" we do n't have a message as such , it 's just ( for ) fun			0
i guess our message is just ' what 's up			0

' on the @entity3 ' started climbing buildings in @entity91 five years ago
since beginning in 2009 , the collective have climbed " thousands " of buildings and *structures*
latest stunt involved hijacking a giant @entity58 billboard in @entity56
