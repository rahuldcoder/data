@entity0 -- a " permissive " environment with inconsistent discipline is one of the factors leading to a spike in @entity8 suicides , according to a new report released thursday			1
the 15 - month - long @entity8 study on suicide prevention concludes there is a need to promote and encourage healthy behavior among troops as one of the key means of reducing suicide levels			1
moreover , the report called on commanders to reinforce efforts to discipline soldiers for substance abuse , criminal behavior and disciplinary problems			1
many of today 's commanders are so focused on getting ready for deployments to war zones , some of these issues have slipped through the cracks , according to @entity8 officials who briefed @entity1 ahead of the release of the study			1
" now more than ever , our soldiers need firm , fair and consistent leadership , " said gen. @entity35 , army vice chief of staff , in the report 's introduction			2
@entity35 led the review team			0
" what we witnessed firsthand were real indicators of stress on the force and an increasing propensity for soldiers to engage in high - risk behavior , " he wrote			1
in fiscal year 2009 , 239 soldiers committed suicide in both the active duty and reserve force , the report noted			0
in addition , 146 soldiers died due to " high risk " behavior , including 74 drug overdoses			1
during the same time frame there were 1,713 suicide attempts , the report said			0
the @entity8 found some form of " high - risk " behavior such as self - harm , illicit drug use , binge drinking or criminal activity was a factor in most of the deaths			1
" for some , the rigors of service , repeated deployments , injuries and separations from family resulted in ( a ) sense of isolation , hopelessness and life fatigue , " @entity35 said			0
he also noted sometimes there has been a " permissive unit environment " which in some commanders " failed to hold soldiers accountable for their actions and allowed for risk taking behavior -- sometimes with fatal consequences			2
" @entity90 's son @entity89 , of @entity91 , @entity92 , was 25 when he committed suicide in 2008 a few months after his second tour in @entity95			0
the @entity8 sergeant had been diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder , she said			0
" i appreciate that the @entity8 needs to identify and address drug - and alcohol - impaired troops , " @entity98 said			2
" any workplace should take the necessary steps to combat that			0
" but @entity98 said the report lacks meaningful information that can help troubled soldiers and their families			2
" it 's critical that the @entity8 and the @entity110 bring our communities into the conversation , and show us in a very clear and easy way how to access resources and services everywhere , including rural areas far from an @entity8 base , " she said			1
" @entity98 said such information is included in the report , but " in a very minimal way			0
" " it 's a really modest list , buried in two paragraphs on @entity126 , " she said			0
in his report , @entity35 was not singling out any particular unit , @entity8 officials said , but rather underscoring the need for commanders to focus on soldiers ' behavior even as they prepare for overseas deployments			1
the @entity8 has long worried that some commanders are so focused on taking their entire unit on deployment , they may not realize or acknowledge that some troops with substance abuse or behavior problems should stay behind for treatment and not deploy			1
officials plan to improve record - keeping so a commander will be more aware of soldiers ' records of problematic behavior			2
