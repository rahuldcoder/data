two white specks appearing next to @entity1 in the blackness of space may look like faint blips on a screen			1
the fuzzy images of moons that @entity10 spacecraft are sending back to @entity11 are a slim crack in a door opening on a vast territory humankind has not seen clearly before			1
and the door will slowly swing open week by week			0
traveling at 1,000,000 miles per day , one of the fastest space vehicles ever made is extending human sight to @entity1 and beyond to spy out details the @entity20 has n't been able to see			2
even at that speed , it took more than nine years to get this close			0
@entity10 launched in january 2006			2
the snaps published this week of @entity25 and @entity26 -- as moons go , both runts the size of large asteroids -- are only a prelude			0
starting in april , for the first time ever , we will begin raising the curtain on @entity1 's surface in ever increasing detail			1
@entity10 has likened it to the myths dispelled , when the @entity41 spacecraft sent back first images of the surface of @entity44 in 1965			1
until then , many scientists thought they 'd see water and vegetation on our neighbor			0
@entity41 hit them instead with a vast rocky desert			0
@entity10 , built and operated by @entity50 , will make its closest pass in july			2
eye popping images will come			0
the on - board camera is powerful enough to recognize objects the size of buildings on @entity1 's surface			1
what we will see is such a mystery that @entity10 does n't speculate much on it			2
perhaps the surface will have ice geysers			0
@entity10 took images of similar spouts as it passed by @entity66			1
maybe @entity1 has rings like @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			2
multiple other instruments will inspect @entity1 's atmosphere			1
by approaching @entity1 , which @entity10 classifies as a dwarf planet , @entity10 will also reach a new region of our solar system , which astronomers divide into classes of planet make - up			1
@entity11 and its neighbors are rocky , earthy planets			2
@entity66 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 are gas planets			0
@entity1 and its partner @entity83 , called by some its moon , are covered in ice			0
@entity1 is part of the @entity89 , a collection of rough celestial bodies that orbit around the sun like the asteroid belt , but it 's interminably larger			1
if the asteroid belt were a thread , the @entity89 would be a strap			0
it is known for producing comets , such as @entity100 , which orbits the sun about every 75 years			0
@entity102 could get quiet after passing @entity1 , but if @entity10 approves , in two years , the spacecraft will go to an additional object or two in that belt .			1

@entity10 satellite sends images of two of @entity1 's moons back to @entity11
as it approaches @entity1 , it 's camera will capture *unprecedented* images of its surface
@entity1 is in the @entity89 ; the spacecraft may visit other objects there
