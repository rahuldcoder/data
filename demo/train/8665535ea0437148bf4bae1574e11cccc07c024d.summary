-- get four successful women together on a movie set and you 'd think it 's all claws , all the time			1
some rumors would insinuate that " @entity9 's " @entity8 does n't get along with her co-star @entity10 , while another would allege there were catfights on the set of the sequel , as the stars revealed in the june issue of @entity18			1
last week there was a similar tiff making headlines , although the spat seemed to be a bit one - sided			0
in an interview with @entity26 , pop star @entity24 referred to fellow superstar @entity27 as a " newcomer " who was " fun to look at , " but @entity24 posted a statement on her website claiming that there was n't any malice behind those words			1
" it is very easy for comments to be taken out of context and create unnecessary drama -- especially between us women , " @entity24 said in the statement			2
" so i would like to tell you all directly so my words can not be misconstrued to sell someone else 's story			2
... i have absolutely nothing against @entity27 or any other female artist in this business			0
" as @entity24 noted in her statement , this is n't the first time she 's " been unfairly pitted against another female artist			1
" if @entity24 or the " @entity9 " stars really are estranged from other famous women , so be it -- but why no mention of their relationship with co-stars @entity57 or @entity59 ? for that matter , where are the stories about how the male actors got along on the set ? " there are hardly ever any stories about male celebrities fighting , " said celebrity blogger @entity65 , who runs @entity66			1
" even when @entity71 got into that car accident while on a date with @entity74 -- even though she was dating @entity75 at the time -- nothing happened			0
@entity75 said they were n't serious , and the story was dropped			2
" obviously , this does n't mean that male celebrities are never pitted against one another in the media -- take a look at earlier beefs between @entity85 and @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 or @entity89 and @entity91 - @entity90 the difference , said @entity93 , director of the @entity94 for @entity95 and @entity96 at @entity97 , is that those battles are often steeped with violent overtones , and they 're treated with more severity than the disputes female celebrities are rumored to have			1
or , @entity103 said , the " celebrity men in conflict " angle will be given a different spin			2
" instead of there being a power struggle or an emotional issue , different work ethics will most likely be cited , " she said			0
" for example , when @entity114 and @entity115 filmed ' @entity116 ' it was said that both men wanted to stay in character even when they were n't shooting			2
so it was understood why they were n't friendly with one another in between takes -- because they were ' in character			2
' if two women did that , it would be pitched as a cover - up for a more deep [ ly ] rooted reason			2
" the actresses themselves seem to accept it as just another part of an oft - dirty business			0
" the chemistry among the four of us is very strong , [ but ] ... the press has to put women in these boxes , rather than show them as the movie portrays them : working together and being powerful , " @entity8 said in the @entity18 interview			0
" things just have to be explosive for no other reason than for people 's imaginations			0
" a likely reason for the media coverage , explained pop culture expert and " @entity151 " author @entity150 , is because " it 's much easier to believe that women do n't like each other			1
it 's one of the few bastions of sexism that 's left in our culture , and we ca n't imagine that powerful , successful women could ever get along			1
" it all boils down to the gender norms many of us are raised with , @entity93 said			0
" one theory we can reject is that the women are fighting with each other more than the men are			0
... anyone who 's been in a workplace knows that it 's not an inherently gender - specific sort of thing , " @entity93 said			0
but " with the gender norms that we 've all grown up with , men manifest their ' cattiness ' differently than women ; we 're ok with the idea that women are emotional , and we expect them to be			1
" but said @entity178 , senior editor of celebrity magazine @entity179 , you ca n't discount the reality of the entertainment industry -- and that 's to sell albums and rack up box - office numbers			1
" obviously , this is a competition , " @entity178 said			0
" people need to be responsible for their own actions -- [ @entity24 ] did say those words , and she said those things for a reason			0
@entity27 , for example , never says anything negative about anybody			0
" if these stars would n't send the media smoke signals with their words or actions , @entity178 said , the media would n't start yelling fire			1
" no one is a victim in the celebrity world , " he added			1
" very few of those rumors end up not being true			0
" regardless of whether they 're true or not , @entity103 said she 's willing to bet the stories of this starlet being angry at that one are n't likely to let up anytime soon			1
" the question is n't why are these stories about women catfights being created , " she said			1
" unfortunately , the question is why not ? people enjoy the drama , and drama and divalike behavior sells			0

there were rumors of rivalries on " @entity220 " set ; stars say they 're untrue
generally , such gossip is about women ; male stars do n't raise same issues , *observers* say
author : fair or not , " it 's much easier to believe that women do n't like each other "
@entity179 editor says , " no one is a victim in the celebrity world "
