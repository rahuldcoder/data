-- on the off chance you 've never been to @entity4 's version of the @entity5 , here 's what that 's like , courtesy of @entity10 deputy editor @entity11 : " there was incredibly little security , " @entity11 told me , describing a 2013 visit for an interview with the country 's president			1
" i took a taxi to the residence , and the taxi pulled up and i was like , ' ok , now what do i do ? ' and the taxi driver said , ' oh , i think you just knock on the door ' ... i just go up and ring the doorbell			2
a butler lets me in			0
" i think there was one of those metal check - point gates that can lift up -- that was on a road -- but if you really wanted to you could just drive around it on the grass			0
" was there a fence ? no. guards ? no. guns ? nope			1
and was the door locked ? " i 'm not sure whether it was unlocked or locked			0
" at this point , you may be thinking @entity4 's president is the most naive person in the universe , especially in light of the @entity48 scandal in the @entity49			1
but i do n't see it that way , and neither does @entity11			2
at a time when the @entity54 is lining up to take jabs at the @entity48 , which , among other legitimately scandalous things , failed to stop an intruder from making it into the @entity59 , @entity4 's no - security state could be seen as a breath of fresh air -- a reminder , as @entity11 and others have put it , that the president is supposed to be one of the people			1
" this is really what the @entity5 is all about			2
it 's the ' @entity73 , ' " first lady @entity69 says in a statement on the @entity5 website			1
" it 's a place that is steeped in history , but it 's also a place where everyone should feel welcome			2
" " @entity78 " is the operative word here			0
i worry such openness wo n't continue in the wake of this scandal			2
a number of @entity5 security " improvements " have been proposed by @entity54 , the news media and the public -- from making the fence around the residence taller to blocking off pedestrian traffic around the building			1
currently , anyone can walk up to the @entity5 's wrought iron fence and can see the building across a lawn			1
this is a popular spot both for tourist photos ( i 've taken them ) and protests			0
troublingly , 16 people are reported to have made it past the fence in the last five years , including one toddler			0
" while the @entity48 considers creating new fences , large buffer zones and checkpoints around the grounds , they are overlooking a simple , cost - effective solution -- bringing in the @entity49 military , " @entity102 , a retired @entity48 agent , wrote in an op - ed for the @entity104			1
but militarize the @entity5 ? i find that shockingly reactionary			2
perhaps i should n't , though			0
when @entity120 was inaugurated as president in 1829 , he famously " opened up the @entity5 and basically let the rabble in , " said @entity116 , director of the @entity117 at @entity118			2
thousands of " people trampled through and they did n't even have to wipe their feet			0
there were reports about how much dirt they had to sweep out afterward			0
" since then , @entity116 told me , " there 's no doubt that we have seen a steady increase in the limitations on public access			0
at this point ( the @entity5 ) is a fortress			1
" there are valid reasons for that			0
assassination attempts and security breaches , like those seen this year , are , of course , cause for concern and precaution			0
but i find it comforting that there are still countries -- including @entity4 -- where the president is allowed to remain part of the people			2
that 's a sign of a healthy society			0
look , i 'm not arguing that the no - one - has - a - gun - and - we - trust - everyone - not - to - shoot - the - president approach that @entity4 takes would function in heavily armed @entity49			1
@entity4 is a country of 320,000 people , which makes it slightly more populous than @entity158			2
its violent crime rate is lower , and there likely are fewer people who would want to assassinate @entity162 “ lafur @entity164 , the country 's president			0
for one , he 's super nice ( he invited me for pancakes when i interviewed him in @entity169 in 2011 )			0
and he 's not the most powerful person in the free world -- or arguably in his country			0
but -- but ! -- as our country investigates the @entity5 security breaches , and demands change , it would be wise of us to remember the @entity5 belongs to the @entity49 people			1
the first family should be made safe , but not by raising fences and creating no - go zones around the perimeter of the people 's house			1
i can imagine a dystopian future in which tourists peer through a thick window of yellowed glass -- like at @entity189 or something -- to see the presidential residence from beyond a concrete barrier			1
i certainly do n't want to live in that country			0
" in an open society , like the @entity49 , or like @entity4 , there 's this idea that the president is one of the people			1
he comes from them and he is accountable to them , " said @entity11 , the @entity199 editor			0
" it would be a shame , in my opinion , if the @entity48 scandal resulted in closing off more public space in @entity209 if you actually wanted to protect the president to a totally 100 % degree , you would keep expanding the secure zone around the @entity5 evermore			1
" but that would come at some cost to the fact that school kids can peer through the fence and see the @entity5 and dream about being president			1
lawmakers and the first family should keep those kids -- those dreamers standing at the @entity5 fence -- at front of mind as they consider reforms .			1

@entity4 's presidential residence does n't have a fence or apparent guards
@entity232 talks with a magazine editor who visited the residence
@entity232 : the @entity49 should n't turn the @entity5 into a fortress
some have suggested making its fence taller or creating a secure perimeter
