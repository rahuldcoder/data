@entity1 , @entity0 -- the many league tables which rank @entity5 programs vary in their methodology , but mainly share a few assumptions , including that a prime mark of quality is a stream of graduates entering highly - paid jobs in financial services and consulting			1
the cuddlier side of business : more mbas are taking in environmental factors			2
however , one @entity5 table , the latest version of which has just been released , factors in some entirely different considerations , namely how well the programs incorporate wider social and environmental issues into their teaching			1
beyond @entity26 , the " alternative " @entity5 top 100 , is produced every two years by the @entity28 ( @entity29 ) in @entity30 , drawn from studies of nearly 600 full - time mba programs worldwide			1
these days , almost all business schools have " at least a beachhead " of environmental and social awareness , according to @entity34 , director of the @entity29 , although the extent of this varies greatly			1
the issue is an important one , he says : " it matters what the senior executives of companies do , say and think			0
" if you can change business education to include an appreciation for the social and environmental context you wind up with leaders who are really good at creating value all around			1
" overall , however , the issue is being taken more and more seriously -- while in 2001 , little more than a third of schools surveyed required students take a course examining the wider issues of business and society , in this year 's survey it has risen to 63 %			2
perhaps unexpectedly , the research shows that such courses are not inevitably housed within a dedicated department of ethics or corporate social responsibility			0
in fact , such departments are only the fifth-most popular home for social or environmental courses , behind those of management , marketing , strategy and finance			0
despite the differences , the @entity75 table is topped by a familiar big hitter -- @entity79 's @entity78 , also in the number one slot for the last such survey in 2005			0
@entity79 , which offers @entity5 students more than 30 elective courses on subjects such as ethics , social responsibility and the environment , says it views the leadership of an organization as " a noble and critical pursuit "			2
this approach now includes a new joint mba in the environment and resources , as well as a course in which business and engineering students join up to solve problems -- one project this year came up with the idea of cheap and easy - to - power led lights for those without mains electricity			0
the @entity105 dominates the top 10 , with one @entity108 school -- @entity110 's @entity109 -- in third , and @entity112 's well known @entity111 in 10th			0
schools are themselves seeing the need for this new type of business education			0
@entity118 's @entity117 , ranked art 26 in the @entity75 table , is planning a link up with the university 's environmental school to study sustainable business			2
" what we 're seeing at @entity118 , and we 're seeing this probably everywhere , is the business community now has reached a point where they recognize that to be globally competitive , you have to have an understanding of the risks and the opportunities that natural environments pose for firms , " says @entity125 , associate professor of business			1
