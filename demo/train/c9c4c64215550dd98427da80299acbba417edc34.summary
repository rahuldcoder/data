-- @entity2 owner @entity1 would rather make a donation to charity than invest millions of dollars in a top @entity6 soccer club because the economics of football make no business sense			1
analzying football 's business model , @entity10 insisted he would not follow the example of @entity16 owned @entity15 winners @entity14 , which has ran up huge losses -- $ 300 million for the last financial year ( the highest figure in @entity20 football history ) -- to assemble a championship team			1
" @entity14 won the championship this year and i hear they 're going to lose $ 156 million			0
i would rather give that money to charity if i had it			0

in the @entity28 team sports such as @entity29 , basketball and baseball are governed by a salary cap , which limits the amount of money a team can spend on players ' wages			2

it 's the same thing i said three years ago , " said @entity1 , who completed a then record purchase of @entity57 franchise the @entity2 in 1994			1
" we could have bought @entity40 before the two ownership groups who preceded us and in the end i do n't want to compete in a business where people throw money at something			0
" i want to be able to compete , " added @entity1			0
" the fans in @entity40 are awesome and they are expecting to win every year , and if you are competing with people who have different rules then it makes it difficult			2
" @entity74 deal : @entity76 's vanity project ? the former @entity2 season - ticket holder argued that the lack of a salary cap combined with other clubs ' decisions to run up significant levels of debt ensured that there was not a level playing field in @entity20 football			1
" we have the resources to do it , it 's just i choose not to do it. , " said @entity1 , who was speaking in @entity87 , where he is taking in the tennis at @entity89 for the 38th consecutive year			0
" i do n't want to be in a business that does not stand on its own , i want every business to stand on its own , and for ego reasons i 'm not willing to lose that kind of money			0
" the only way i would go into a sports business is to win			0
and , i do n't think i can compete on an equal footing so i choose not to do it			0
