while some of the 65 days of testimony has covered tedious medical and legal ground , @entity4 's music and intimate home videos are often shown on two big screens in the tiny @entity0 courtroom the jurors were getting an inside look friday at how @entity4 's family tried to intervene in the singer 's prescription drug use as @entity13 's lawyers showed them video of their questioning of @entity39 , @entity4 's youngest brother			1
the jury will eventually have a billion - dollar decision to make : is @entity13 liable in @entity4 's death and , if so , how much should the promoter - producer of his comeback tour pay the family in damages ? @entity47 and her grandchildren -- @entity49 , @entity50 and @entity51 -- contend @entity13 negligently hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity52 , the physician now serving a prison term for involuntary manslaughter in @entity4 's death			1

" he was like a lost boy , " @entity22 wrote in an e-mail to @entity13 ceo @entity13 days before @entity4 's death			1
" there still may be a chance he can rise to the occasion if we get him the help he needs			0
" after a poor rehearsal on june 13 , 2009 , and a missed rehearsal the next day , @entity22 expressed his concern in an e-mail to @entity13 co-ceo @entity110 : " were you aware that @entity4 's doctor did n't permit him to attend rehearsals yesterday ? are @entity39 and @entity114 ( @entity115 , another @entity4 manager ) aware of this ? please have them stay on top of his health situation without invading @entity4 's privacy			1

the drug interrupts crucial @entity155 sleep cycles , depriving the brain of real rest and repair , the expert said			0

@entity4 lawyers contend that is why @entity4 was revitalized			2
@entity4 lawyers argued that @entity52 was influenced by a conflict of interest -- created by his arrangement with @entity13 -- to continue dangerous propofol infusions to help @entity4 rest for rehearsals			2
he was $ 1 million in debt and had abandoned his medical practice two months earlier to serve as @entity4 's personal physician for the tour			1
if he failed to get @entity39 to rehearsals , the shows might be postponed or canceled and he would be out of a job , they argue			0
blame game lawyers for both sides used @entity22 's appearance in court to argue over who was responsible for @entity4 's death -- the promoter or the artist			1
" at the time , did you think mr. @entity4 was responsible for his own health ? " @entity13 's @entity16 asked			2

they have to be responsible for themselves			0

" @entity15 : " check them out to make sure they had no conflict ? " @entity22 : " yes			0
" @entity15 : " it would be irresponsible not to do that ? " @entity22 : " yes			0
" as @entity22 stepped off the witness stand thursday afternoon , several jurors applauded			0
