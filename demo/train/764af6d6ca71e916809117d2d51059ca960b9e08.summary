-- @entity1 , the ride - sharing service , is once again in the spotlight for a pr nightmare of its own making			1
stunningly , executive @entity7 suggested -- in what may have been off - the - record comments -- that the company might not be above threatening journalists who criticize @entity12			2
in the past , @entity1 supporters have offered excuses for the company 's blunders , saying that its speed of growth creates stress and contributes to mistakes			1
@entity1 seems to make many mistakes			1
tracking a journalist 's whereabouts with an app called " @entity26 , " or conflating the @entity1 on - demand car service with a fictitious on - demand service trolling for women that ceo @entity30 calls " boob - er , " are not good ideas			2
but the story is more important than @entity34 gaffes and immature jokes			0
@entity1 is the latest example in a long line of organizations and professional cultures guided by corporate narcissism			1
such companies are so consumed with preening and filling their coffers that they lose sight of their customers			1
when taken to an extreme , corporate narcissism can put customers at risk			1
they can even be physically hurt and have their lives turned upside down in disastrous ways			0
consider the number of people whose lives were shattered in the 2007 mortgage crisis			0
led by a notoriously narcissistic company , @entity55 , the rapacious mortgage and banking industry zeroed in on new profits from record numbers of mortgages by giving unqualified borrowers loans			2
who cared if folks could n't pay back the money ? when the inevitable housing market crash came , countless lives were left in ruins as the roofs over their heads were taken away			2
the financial meltdown was so epic that we 're still recovering from it today			0
yet , most of the mortgage and banking institutions involved remained standing despite the big mess			0
revelations of @entity78 players who were hardly punished for domestic violence incidents or charges of drug addiction have become almost commonplace			0
and what about players who suffer brain damage , depression and dementia , as a result of repeated concussions -- a situation long covered up by the @entity78 ? it seems like the @entity78 keeps its eye more on league success at the expense of player ethics and safety			0
where 's the accountability ? or consider @entity100 , whose ceo , @entity101 , lost his job earlier this year after presiding over many missteps , including a massive credit card data breach that affected millions of customers			0
if @entity100 had heeded early warnings from its @entity110 department , maybe this could have been prevented			0
but the company seemed to have lost its focus , and the protection of customers ' privacy did n't garner as much attention			1
one need look no further than the past few months to see @entity1 barreling down similarly narcissistic paths			1
and people are pushing back asking , among other things , if their personal safety is at risk when they get in an @entity1 car			1
can they really trust that this company , with such apparently impulsive and aggressive leadership , will protect them and ensure a positive experience ? what companies need is a culture of consumer accountability			2
but @entity1 is going in the opposite direction			2
none of the @entity12 " competencies " that are expected of employees focuses on appealing to customers , much less consumer values like responsibility for passenger safety , privacy , data protection or the right to a rating - free experience after a ride			0
@entity1 's privacy policy is vague and not transparent , which could lead to abuses of customer data security , especially in full - steam - ahead cultures where the message is anything goes if it drives scale			1
the company has yet to address what it will do with the abundant customer data it collects with every ride			0
but even in the absence of these protections , a company whose ceo thinks of women as " boob - ers " may not be perceived as one that has every consumer 's interest at heart			0
the company may see this moment of blowback as a speed bump on its way to world dominance -- an inconvenience that can be managed by an expert political campaigner , a pr challenge that can be smoothed over through private dinners with media influencers			2
in reality , @entity1 is a company at major risk of losing its lead in the market			1
the app is easily copied and the service it provides erects no barriers to competitive entry			0
if @entity1 changes its approach from narcissism to accountability by focusing on consumer relationships and loyalty , it will have a chance at a bright future .			1

@entity1 recently was in the spotlight again for a pr nightmare of its own making
@entity205 : @entity1 is the latest company to be guided by corporate narcissism
she says such companies lose sight of their customers ; at times consumers can be put at risk
@entity205 : if @entity1 does n't change its narcissistic way , it will lose its lead in the market
