-- you may not have noticed it because of that helmet he had to wear while free - falling into the history books , but @entity6 is kind of hot			1
yes , yes , we know that sounds incredibly superficial , but these things are important when considering who should be cast to play @entity6 in a movie about his record - breaking leap			1
because honestly , you know someone , somewhere , is already trying to figure out how to turn it into a film			2
and we want to offer an assist			2
here are just a few of the @entity20 hunks who come to mind : @entity24 - you can kind of see it , right ? rugged jaw line , stubble , the hard athletic body from hours of training for a death - defying feat. and a vocal coach could be brought in to help @entity24 learn an @entity34 accent			1
@entity36 - four words for you : " @entity38 in space			1
" need we say more ? and in the interest of creative license , the " @entity42 " star could land on his feet after the jump and break into a celebratory dance			0
@entity50 - speaking of " @entity38 , " @entity36 's co-star in that film could also make an interesting daredevil			1
and in an interview he reportedly said he is a " fan of fear " -- and @entity6 's feat was definitely a scary one			1
@entity57 - there was a huge outcry when @entity57 's character was killed off in @entity61 's " @entity60 " so we know he has a fan base			0
he 's also a pretty intense actor and could probably pull this one off with ease			0
@entity65 - the actor has been missed since his star turn in the now ended @entity68 series " @entity69			0
" he has range , having convincingly portrayed everyone from @entity71 to the king of rock and roll , @entity72 , so why not ? @entity74 - he plays a lunatic in " @entity76 " and we 'd like to see him get a break from often playing the heavy			0
he 's had smaller roles in films like " @entity82 " and " @entity83 , " and a lead would be nice			0
@entity85 - because he is @entity85 , and any opportunity to have more of @entity85 we will take			0
who would you throw into the mix as a possible @entity6 ? sound off below .			2
