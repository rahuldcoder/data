i was diagnosed with diabetes 12 years ago			1
at the time , i was caring for my mother , who was on dialysis and had had her leg amputated			1
as a family , we knew very little about diabetes -- only that once you got it , you deteriorated and died			1
like our father , who suffered a stroke and then died years later of a massive heart attack brought on by complications of diabetes			1
both my parents , in fact , died from complications of diabetes			1
they were strong pillars of our family and community , taken way too soon by a disease that is the leading cause of death among @entity23			1
before seeing the doctor , i had been experiencing extreme thirst , especially at night			1
the tips of my toes felt like bees lived there and were desperate to burst out of my skin			1
my vision became blurred after each meal			1
it was 2 p.m. and i had n't eaten anything when the doctor tested my blood sugar level			1
it was in the high 200s			2
normal is between 110 and 125			2
you have diabetes , ms. @entity40 , the doctor said			1
he prescribed metformin and directed me to a dietitian			2
she further reiterated what the doctor had told me : how food was related to high blood glucose levels and how consistently high blood glucose levels will eventually lead to amputations , blindness , kidney failure , stroke and other complications			1
fit nation : why i gave up soda i followed the dietician 's plan for the next few months			2
i took up walking and noticed that my vision had become clearer			2
but it did n't take me long to fall back to my old eating habits			2
a colleague 's birthday celebration , a brother 's graduation party , a friend 's wedding , a cousin 's funeral -- these were all occasions where food was at the center			1
and in our culture , you show appreciation and respect for those who prepared the food by eating it			1
i soon found myself hovering around 400 pounds			1
after six years of oral medication , i was switched to insulin injections			2
my blood sugar levels were too high , and i was not managing them well			2
insulin was scary at first			2
but then i realized it gave me the freedom to eat all my favorite foods ! i would just inject 100 units , and my blood sugar would be normal in a matter of minutes			1
soon , i was injecting as much as 300 units of insulin a day			2
it was at this time that i began experiencing extreme pain in my teeth and gums			2
one of my front teeth became longer than the rest , and i found that i could n't bite into certain foods , such as apples			2
this front tooth was eventually pulled			2
the dentist did n't have to do much ; it pretty much fell out on its own			0
injecting large amounts of insulin meant i was prone to low blood sugar			0
i would wake up in a sweat as energy quickly left my body			0
my 8 - year - old son saved my life continuously during this time ; he knew exactly what to do and how to inject insulin			0
the fact that my life was being saved by a child shamed me			0
eighteen months ago , my sister and i moved our family from @entity123 to @entity124			1
i saw the move as an opportunity for me not only to change my own life but , most important , to give my son his childhood			0
fit nation : celebrate small victories the first thing we did as a family was to enroll at a recreation center			0
we were all exercising together			0
the kids had fun in the pool , and i found myself walking again			0
i also decided to educate myself about diabetes			1
i had read about people reversing diabetes by eating a plant - based diet			1
it was an easy plan to follow because i love fruit and vegetables , and they are in abundance here			1
yet i found that i could n't chew much without feeling extreme pain			0
i bought a @entity150 blender and started throwing all my vegetables and fruits into it			0
by @entity154 , i had dropped 80 pounds			1
then , three days before @entity154 , my dentist told me that i had advanced periodontal disease and all my teeth had to be removed			0
not effectively controlling my diabetes had proven too much for my gums			1
i welcomed anything to remove the pain i was experiencing			0
i decided to ask my friends to film the surgery			0
the filmmaker kept asking me , " girl , are you sure about this ? are n't you afraid people are going to talk about you ? " you can watch the film on @entity170			0
it 's called " @entity172 at the dentist			0
" since then , my son has n't had to worry about waking up at 3 or 4 a.m. to revive me			0
in fact , since i began training for the @entity177 three weeks ago , we are all sleeping soundly through the night			1
with the demands of training , i realize that my body needs more fuel			1
while i enjoy green smoothies , i also need protein and carbohydrates			0
our choice of animal protein comes from turkey , salmon , chicken , canned tuna and eggs			0
i buy whole - grain pasta , quinoa and brown rice			0
we eat only wheat bread and do not eat white flour or sugar			0
my boys love saimin , a form of ramen noodles popular on the islands			0
when i make it now , i add broccoli , peas and green onions and throw out the spice packet , which contains a ton of sodium			0
they complain and ask , " then what 's the use of eating saimin ? " that 's when i show them my dentures , and there 's sudden silence			0
i still do n't know all the answers to diabetes and obesity			1
all i know is that we have to look hard at our reasons for change			0
i 'll be damned if i lose any other body part to this disease			1
did i mention that i ran my first mile this morning nonstop ? how the ' @entity226 ' came to be			0
