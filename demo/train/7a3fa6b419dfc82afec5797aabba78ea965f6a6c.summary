@entity2 morning show anchor @entity0 wore the same suit every day for a year , minus a dry cleaning here and there			1
his co-anchor , @entity7 , wears something different every day -- and viewers regularly let her have it			1
( one correspondent demanded she " get some style " and called one outfit " jarring and awful			1
" ) a double standard ? of course			1
@entity0 was trying to make a point about sexism , he told @entity2 's @entity18			1
" i 'm judged on my interviews , my appalling sense of humor -- on how i do my job , basically			1
whereas women are quite often judged on what they 're wearing or how their hair is , " he said			0
it 's certainly nothing new			1
there are hundreds of " worst - dressed women " galleries after awards shows , but almost nobody publishes a " worst - dressed " gallery of actors ; few keep track of @entity36 's hairstyles as assiduously as they do those of his former wife , @entity39			2
and often , as @entity0 pointed out on monday 's show , it 's women criticizing other women			2
indeed , there 's a whole industry of gossip and fashion magazines targeted at women that exist to showcase women 's clothing and " hot new looks , " while in magazines aimed at men -- such as @entity57 and @entity58 -- fashion and style are simply portions of a much larger scope of issues			1
it 's " ridiculous , " agrees @entity64 - based style consultant @entity63 -- but nevertheless , she adds , there 's something to be said for being noticed			1
" is it deep down a good thing ? yes , " she says			0
" from a business perspective , it 's excellent that viewers feel connected enough or engaged enough that they can write to their local newscaster and say , ' hey , you look kinda crummy today			2
' if you 're being talked about , great			0
it means people care about your appearance			0
" moreover , she adds , men are aware of image as well , even if it 's usually under the radar			2
( there are exceptions : both @entity84 and @entity85 were criticized for their choice of suits , and @entity63 says that her mother once accosted the notoriously sloppy @entity64 mayor @entity89 and told him to clean up			2
) " i 've noticed that with my ( male ) executive clients and @entity93 , they 're more interested in products for their face -- eye creams and whitening their teeth , " she says			2
" so you may not notice it to the naked eye , but the bottom line is there 's a lot below the surface we should look into			0
" besides , women have more options : a male broadcaster such as @entity0 is pretty much locked into a suit and tie , while a woman can indulge in some variety ( though tv image consultants may have something to say about that , as @entity115 observed in a pointed speech )			1
" it 's not completely black and white , " @entity63 adds			1
" it seems that way -- and it 's unfair -- but there 's a lot going on beneath the surface , too			1
" still , @entity0 is glad he got the conversation going			0
on monday 's show , @entity115 pointed out that his stunt even got attention in the @entity128			0
and now , at the urging of his colleagues , @entity0 plans to change			0
his suit , that is			0
" only @entity7 and ( colleague @entity133 ) know about the suit			0
they often remark that it 's getting a bit stinky , " he told @entity18			0
" i 'm hoping to get it into the dry cleaners at the end of the year			0
