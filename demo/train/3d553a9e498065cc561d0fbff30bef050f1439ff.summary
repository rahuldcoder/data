-- @entity2 toasts danger with a glass of bubbly in one hand and a clenched fist in the other			1
the @entity7 has good reason to celebrate after smashing the @entity10 record over 500 meters , reaching an average speed of 56.62 knots ( 104.8 kph )			1
the record was officially confirmed by the @entity13 on thursday			2
" this record was something else , " the ecstatic 34 - year - old told @entity0 earlier in november			2
" facing fierce winds and unrelenting waves , @entity2 beat the previous record set by @entity22 @entity21 by 0.97 knots -- an effort achieved in a sport where danger is always lurking			1
" it 's an action sport , so of course , it can be dangerous , " said @entity2 , who celebrated his achievement with a glass of champagne			1
. " it 's as dangerous as any other sport like cycling and you have to be careful not to make any mistakes because it can end with bad injuries			0
" i 've been lucky and only had one bad injury , which came in competition last season			0
" ask @entity2 about his latest achievement and he gives a @entity45 shrug and a small laugh , but this is no minor achievement for the @entity48 - born star who has hunted down record after record			1
in 2010 he became the first man to break through the 100km/hr barrier -- an achievement which earned him no shortage of recognition			2
his latest triumph came in the salt marshes of @entity58 where he was carried along by the @entity59 -- a fierce cold wind which blows toward the @entity61 from the uplands in southern @entity7			1
the wind speed can often reach up to 130km - making it the ideal place for breaking records			2
" it is a very strong and powerful wind , " added the @entity7			1
" it blows really hard			0
we had speeds of 55 knots sometimes			0
the wind can be really wild and you have to be careful			0
" we 've had days when its almost 60 knots and that can be too much			0
" after taking up the sport 12 years ago , @entity2 has excelled by winning three world titles and two national championships and he now plans to break more records			1
but before that , he plans a celebration -- or two -- with that champagne			0
" the team have worked with me throughout this record and they deserve to celebrate , " he added			0
" everyone has worked so hard to make this happen and i want to enjoy it with them			0
