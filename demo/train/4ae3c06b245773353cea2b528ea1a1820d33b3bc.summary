-- @entity2 and @entity3 scientists watching @entity5 's massive ice sheet have found what appears to be a 460 - mile " megacanyon " far beneath the frozen surface of the world 's largest island			1
airborne radar images taken by the @entity3 space agency @entity14 and compiled by scientists at the @entity16 revealed the canyon 's existence , @entity12 glaciologist @entity11 said thursday			0
it 's buried under the layer of ice that blankets @entity5 , a covering up to 3 kilometers ( 1.9 miles ) thick			1
the gouge is about 50 % longer than @entity24 's 277 - mile @entity23 , but not as deep -- ranging from 650 feet to about 2,600 feet ( 200 to 800 meters ) , @entity11 said			1
it runs from the middle of @entity5 to its northern shore , on the @entity28 , and it 's likely to have been covered over by ice for 4 million years			1
" it 's a continuous canyon			0
it very much looks like it predates the ice sheets , " @entity11 said			0
" we think it 's indicative of a river system that was here before the ice sheet was there , and which perhaps was modified by the ice sheet cover some , but not much			1
" the discovery is a byproduct of the intense scientific focus on @entity5 amid concerns about rising global temperatures			1
the radar images were shot by @entity14 's @entity47 , which flies aircraft over the island because the ice sheet is too thick for satellite - based radar to penetrate , said @entity52 , the project 's lead scientist			2
@entity11 and colleagues from @entity12 , the @entity54 in @entity55 and @entity56 in @entity57 published their findings thursday in the journal @entity61			0
they were trying to compile an updated set of ice - sheet records when they noticed " this long linear feature that seemed to be pretty continuous , " @entity11 said			0
" it looks like it was a pretty extensive river system millions of years ago , " he said			1
the find is n't a " first - order concern " for scientists studying climate change but will help researchers understand how the ice ebbs and flows across the face of @entity5 and other polar environments , @entity11 said			2
the main reason @entity5 is under study is to record the height of the ice above it , not to map the land beneath , @entity52 said			2
the existence of the canyon is " basically a tiny piece in the big puzzle of what 's going on in @entity5 , " but still an exciting find , he said			0
" we live in the 21st century , and we are still discovering 750 - kilometer features under the @entity5 ice sheet that we did n't know about , " he said			0
as climate warms , @entity28 spawns massive ice islands			0

a 460 - mile canyon up to half a mile deep lies beneath @entity5 's ice
the discovery was reported in a scientific journal thursday
" it looks like it was a pretty extensive river system millions of years ago , " scientist says
