@entity0 , @entity1 -- a tender smile frames the face of @entity5 as she remembers the life of her 6 - year old son			1
" @entity8 was a very happy boy , " she says			0
" he gave me flowers all the time			0
he 's the first ' man ' ( to ) give me flowers			2
" but her smile is thinly veiled -- her face splintering into tears as she permits the raw truth to surface			0
on @entity16 in 1999 , @entity8 suffered severe head trauma while sledding in the snow - covered mountains above the @entity21 basin			2
@entity5 says she tried to reach her son but could n't navigate thick snow and ice			1
she flagged down a passing vehicle and asked the occupants to alert authorities			0
@entity8 was airlifted to @entity28 , where , two days later , he was declared brain dead			0
a family care coordinator with one legacy , an organ and tissue recovery agency , approached @entity5 and her husband , @entity34 , to talk about donating @entity8 's organs			1
they decided to donate four of @entity8 's organs : his heart , liver and both kidneys			1
" the right kidney went to an older white gentleman , " says @entity40 , @entity8 's stepfather			2
" the left kidney went to an older @entity45 gentleman			0
his heart went to a young @entity48 boy , and his liver was given to a young girl			1
" that young girl , 9 - year old @entity51 , recently recalled the day when she and her mother , @entity52 , received word that a donor organ was available			1
they were at a car wash when the pager from one legacy started buzzing			0
" i called the coordinator and she told me , ' we have a liver for @entity51 , get here as soon as you can , ' " @entity52 said			2
" i was like ' wow ! that was fast , after only being of the donor waiting list two weeks			0
' " when @entity51 was just 7 years old , she was diagnosed with autoimmune hepatitis , a liver disease that she says " made my body think i did n't have a liver			1
" " i was jaundiced and i was throwing up blood , " says @entity51 , who turns 22 this month			0
" basically , when they did the transplant , they said my liver was shrinking , so i was pretty sick			2
" four years after her successful transplant , @entity51 sent a thank - you letter to the @entity40 family			2
in the letter , printed on floral paper , @entity51 tells the unnamed " @entity78 " she enjoys music and watching " @entity83 " reruns			0
" i had my liver transplant when i was 9 years old			1
i am now 13 and i am doing very well , " she wrote			0
" i am very thankful that you decided to have your loved one 's organs donated			1
" three years after @entity51 sent that letter , the two families -- who lived about 30 miles away -- agreed to meet			1
" @entity51 came to gladden our hearts , " @entity40 said			0
" to me , she is an angel that was given life by another angel , and in our lives , she is a source of light			2
" since they first met in 2006 , the @entity100 and @entity40 families get together every year at fundraising events for @entity102 , which handles the national organ and tissue registry and helps to raise awareness about the benefits of organ donations			2
the @entity108 treat @entity51 like their own child , and @entity5 and @entity51 have formed a particularly close bond , communicating nearly every day , either on the phone or via @entity112			1
it 's rare for donor and recipient families to meet , let alone forge such a close relationship , according to @entity118 of @entity102			1
" in the case of @entity8 , it was devastating for the family to lose him in such an accident , " @entity118 said			2
" and yet at that time , they saw the opportunity to leave a legacy of life where they could see @entity8 's gift grow into other people			1
" @entity51 's mother said that sometimes , the meetings between the two families have " been a little awkward , i think maybe ( because of ) the language barrier			1
" but , @entity134 added , " i see , especially in @entity51 , that it 's something that gives her a boost and a spark in life			1
that life is worth living because of her connection with this family			2
" on a recent saturday morning at the @entity144 next to the @entity145 , the @entity143 and @entity40 families met to help hundreds of other volunteers decorate the @entity102 float for the @entity148 scheduled for january 1			0
@entity5 grasped @entity51 's hand tightly and said , " look at the float ! " " @entity152 , " read the banner , " one more day i can have with @entity8 and one more day that people are on the waiting list -- they want one more day to receive the transplant			1
" three years ago , the @entity40 family was chosen to make a floragraph -- a floral portrait of @entity8 on the @entity102 float featured in the parade			0
@entity5 was selected to walk alongside the float , holding a tether to a hot - air balloon that featured a portrait of @entity8			1
" ( @entity165 ) was literally connected to his portrait , " @entity118 said			0
" so for her , it was like walking five miles with her son again			0
" this year , @entity40 was chosen by his fellow volunteers to represent them on the @entity102 float			0
he will be one of 28 float riders			0
the @entity40 family volunteers with @entity102			0
every week , @entity5 shares her story of loss to visitors to the @entity176 consulate in downtown @entity21 in the hopes they will sign up to become organ and tissue donors			1
@entity5 credits the organization for giving " my son 's death meaning			1
" " i realize that his organs and his life live on in other people , " she said			1
with their son never far from their thoughts , the @entity40 family will spend this @entity192 at @entity193 in @entity195 decorating @entity8 's grave site with tinsel , wreaths and artificial snow as they do every year			1
" in the six short years that @entity8 was on @entity202 , it was clear to see that he was a marvelous boy , " @entity40 said			0
" the fact that he was so marvelous and generous made it easier for us to make the choice to have him be an organ and tissue donor			0
" he was a happy child , and the time that i spent with him and held him were really the joy in my life			0
