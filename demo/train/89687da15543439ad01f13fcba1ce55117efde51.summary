-- what do they have to be ashamed of ? several years ago , i caught one of my kids sneaking out of the house			0
like any mom , i was more than a little mad and demanded an explanation			0
" but @entity9 , i was n't doing anything wrong -- i was just hanging out with my friends , " was the response i got , but i knew better			2
the truth is that if you do n't have anything to be ashamed of , you have no reason to be sneaking around			2
this election season , special interests are sneaking around trying to influence voters by funding the attack ads you see on tv			1
with the help of a recent court ruling , they can do it all anonymously			0
it 's hard not to think it 's because they have something to be ashamed of			0
in january , the @entity30 gave corporations , unions and special interest groups the power to influence elections in an unlimited and anonymous way			1
in an unprecedented move , the court , the same majority who decried an activist court when they were nominees , legislated from the bench and overturned years of previous case law , striking down longstanding limitations on campaign spending from special interests in the case of @entity47			1
before @entity47 , corporations and unions could not spend money to run ads expressly advocating one candidate over another			2
but what is worse , they can anonymously donate millions of dollars to " nonprofit " groups , which buy the ads without having to disclose who truly paid for them			1
the ruling essentially opened the barn door to anonymous , unlimited corporate donations to sway voters			0
@entity67 have a lot to be frustrated about right now with our economy , and i know many are anxiously awaiting their opportunity to weigh in on the country 's future by voting on november 2			0
the idea that special interests are trying to secretly buy this election should make their blood boil			1
although every member of @entity81 should be trying to stop this , that is not the case			0
@entity84 have blocked legislation that would help bring these donors to light			0
a bill offered by sen. @entity89 , which i co-sponsored , would have forced corporations and unions that want to spend money on campaign ads to be transparent with the public about their political contributions and their donors , while also banning political spending from foreign entities			1
but each time the bill has received a vote , @entity84 have made sure it failed			0
this bill would n't favor one side or the other : from the most conservative groups to the most liberal , any special interest group spending money on campaign ads would have to be honest about where their funding comes from so voters know whose interest they really represent			1
republicans spend a lot of time decrying activist court decisions , yet when it comes to overturning campaign limits and disclosure rules for special interests , they seem to have changed their minds			1
the reality is that special interests are trying to buy our government this cycle , and @entity84 think that 's ok			1
well , i do n't			0
my position is simple : if you are for someone or something , you should be willing to say it out loud			0
the voters deserve to know			0
right now , these shadowy organizations are refusing to produce a list of their donors , and that 's something voters need to consider in november			2
my rule of thumb is , if i ca n't find out who 's paying for the ad , i do n't believe it			1
when my teenager tried to pull a fast one on me , i said if you 're not willing to own up to it , how do i know you 're not doing something wrong ? this election cycle , special interests are trying to get away with buying this election without being held accountable			2
until they are more forthcoming with where the money is coming from , how can voters believe a word they say ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of sen. @entity155 .			1

corporations , unions , special interest groups can fund campaign advertising anonymously
sen. @entity155 , a @entity162 , says special interests seek to buy votes by funding attack ads
republicans opposed bill to force disclosure of donors ' names and amounts , she writes
the rule of thumb is , @entity155 says , if you ca n't find out who 's paying for the ad , do n't believe it
