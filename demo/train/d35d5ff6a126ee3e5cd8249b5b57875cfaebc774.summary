@entity0 , @entity1 -- for @entity6 cinema , the shadow of auteur @entity4 has cast long over the blue sky of the @entity8 in @entity9			1
with a minimal presence abroad , @entity6 film has often relied on the reputable auteur for international recognition			1
recently a new light has been shining for @entity6 cinema internationally			1
earlier this year , over a decade after " @entity15 " handed @entity4 a " @entity16 , " @entity17 has managed to get modern @entity6 cinematography back in the line - up at the prestigious world of @entity21			1
his sophomore film , " @entity23 , " won the " @entity25 " prize in the 62nd edition of the festival and gave the 36 - year - old director one of the most coveted prizes awarded to young filmmakers			1
here , @entity31 talks to @entity32 only a few days after " @entity23 's " latest win -- first prize at the @entity35			1
the screening room : " @entity23 " is about three siblings who grow up in complete seclusion , isolated by their parents from society			2
how did you come up with the story ? @entity31 : i co-wrote the script for " dogtooth " with @entity46			2
i wanted to write a story about the waning of the traditional family			1
then , i thought of a father who wants to protect his family unit at all costs and the system he invents in order to do this			0
the siblings in " @entity23 " are only taught what their parents choose to reveal to them about the world , and this is very little			2
the teens are only allowed to exercise , play with each other and watch home videos			0
they do n't know what a telephone is and they think that airplanes only exist as toys			0
they are told that their most feared enemy is a cat and they are taught to bark and act obediently like dogs			0
@entity32 : can you identify a new wave of films coming out of @entity6 and do these films have a singular voice ? @entity17 : no , the films that do well in @entity6 are very different from each other			2
i think one of the advantage of not having a proper film school is that @entity6 now has several individual films to showcase			1
there is not a single @entity6 new wave with common characteristics			2
for example , to mention some recent films , @entity92 ' " strella , " " @entity93 " by @entity94 and " @entity23 " are all very different from one another			2
@entity32 : how did you finance " @entity23 , " and what particular production challenges did you face ? @entity17 : funding is the biggest challenge for @entity6 filmmakers			1
" @entity23 " received about $ 300,000 ( â‚¬ 200,000 ) from the @entity101 , the state body supporting @entity6 film production			1
@entity104 and i put in a large amount of money and a lot of our friends volunteered their time and talent to this production			0
due to a lack of funds , many @entity6 films end up being made because people volunteer their time to filmmakers , but this is not necessarily a healthy practice for the film industry			1
@entity32 : what is the kind of reception " @entity23 " has gotten so far ? @entity17 : " @entity128 " director and the 2009 @entity127 president @entity126 said that " @entity23 " completely surprised him			1
because most @entity6 films do not find international distributors , most viewers have a limited idea of what a @entity6 film is			1
most people think of a fisherman , a beautiful island , and ancient ruins			0
most of " @entity23 " is shot in a big house and the surrounding garden , as the children are not allowed outside the house			2
in this way , the film played with the expectation viewers had when going to see a @entity6 film			1
@entity32 : @entity149 ceo @entity148 told @entity32 that when a film is rooted in it 's local culture , it does n't necessarily travel as well			0
do you think " @entity23 " is a universal story ? @entity17 : i think it is universal			0
it 's a commentary on mass illusion , how world leaders and the media only channel certain information to the public , isolating us from the truth			0
it 's also a commentary on what happens to human beings functioning in a climate of oppression			0
@entity32 : can art and commerce go hand in hand for a filmmaker ? @entity17 : it depends what films you want to make			0
i think art and commerce can co-exist @entity177 in the same film			0
for example , it is a big surprise to all of us that an arthouse film like " @entity23 " is doing really well at the @entity6 box office : 25,000 admissions in @entity6 is considered a market success			1
after a six week run in two cities , " @entity23 " is still screening			0
we have also secured several international distribution deals , including @entity191 distribution , the @entity193 countries , @entity194 and @entity195			0
@entity32 : the filmmakers of @entity6 ( @entity197 ) , a group of filmmakers you belong to , is asking the @entity6 for an overhaul of its legal framework for the film industry			1
what does @entity197 hope to see in the new cinema law ? @entity17 : the @entity197 group would like to see tax incentives for private investment in films			0
it 's really discouraging that , despite a law requiring private television networks to reinvest 1.5 percent of their earnings back into the local film industry , this is hardly ever executed			0
what 's really extraordinary about @entity197 is that it 's the first time that more than 200 film industryites have joined forces in asking for drastic and immediate change of the filmmaking environment in @entity6			2
the current film industry can not advance with a law that is 20 years old			0
besides abstaining from the @entity227 this year , a group of filmmakers that sprung out of @entity197 are dedicating their efforts to an independent @entity229 , which will award its own prizes to the best talent in @entity6 .			2

@entity31 ' " @entity23 " won the " @entity25 " prize in @entity9 earlier this year
his second film deals with the waning of the traditional family in a novel way
funding is the biggest challenge for @entity6 *filmakers* , according to the 36 - year - old director
he is one of few @entity6 directors making waves internationally
