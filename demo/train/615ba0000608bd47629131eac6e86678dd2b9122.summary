@entity0 , @entity1 -- the still charred brick walls reverberated with music for the first time since a 2009 fire gutted the iconic @entity7			1
the historic venue , though rebuilt and modernized , still showed the scars of the blaze that almost devoured the entire building			1
the @entity12 , an indie rock band from @entity0 , @entity1 , began their sound check in the same spot that helped launch the careers of @entity16 , the @entity17 and many other influential groups			1
" that 's the first song that 's been played in here in two years , " said owner @entity19 , a smile beaming from his face now that construction was complete and the music had returned			2
after two years of working to the sounds of backhoes and jackhammers , @entity19 hears rock ' n ' roll			2
there were major doubts about whether the musical landmark would come back after the fire			1
but on august 1 the theatre opened its doors to ticket holders for a triumphant two - week series of performances			1
@entity19 said he will never forget the reopening			2
" it was just such a magical night to finally see people back in here			2
" the still - unexplained fire ignited overnight inside a guest dressing room and fully engulfed the building 's mostly wooden interior			1
in just a few hours the blaze destroyed the interior of the more than 100 - year - old building			1
august 2010 : theater struggles after fire the final cost to rebuild the theater and retrofit it to modern building codes : $ 4.5 million			1
insurance only covered what little was owed on the original structure and the owners were limited by how much they could borrow from the bank			2
donations and fundraising benefits have brought in more than $ 250,000			0
the largest donation came from the @entity63 winning @entity64 , another product of the @entity0 music scene			0
without these contributions , the theater might not have been brought back to life			1
" we raised exactly as much as we had to			0
had we raised any less it would n't have worked , " said @entity19			0
the theater continues to accept donations and high - level donors are honored in a photo gallery inside the theater that documents the fire and rebuilding process			1
the new space has been transformed from four blackened exterior brick walls and a heap of smoldering rubble to what theater production manager @entity83 describes as a world class music venue			1
" everything is designed to operate and support a-list artists , " he said			1
the @entity92 ' guitarist and singer @entity93 was heartbroken when he got the call that the theater had burned down			1
" it 's a very important part of our town 's music history , " @entity93 said			1
" we were all very upset			0
" he was pleased with how much the re-build matches the original grandeur			0
" i think they did an absolutely fantastic job with it , " he said			0
" i was blown away ! " the rickety wooden steps that at one point led patrons to the balcony have been replaced with an elevator and three floors of a fire - safe enclosed spiral staircase			1
the worn and tattered bars have been rebuilt using wood salvaged from the rubble			0
and the new 65,000 watt sound system fills the room completely to ensure the 1,087 fans get what they came for , the music			0
though the insides have changed , the remodeled structure still pays homage to the original			0
there are still two bars that flank either side on the main level			0
stately red curtains still outline the stage and the same exposed brick walls , though more charred than before , are all still there			0
starting with a blank slate also gave theater management the ability to make improvements			2
a three - tiered balcony gives a great vantage point to see the shows and a rooftop bar allows concertgoers the opportunity to step outside and soak in the evening			2
the remodelers ' ultimate goal , though , was to give the theater an updated look without taking away from the feel of the original layout			2
" even though it 's a different place , it 's still the same , it 's still the grand old theater , " @entity83 said			1
the building was transformed into a movie theater in the 1930s and has been everything from a @entity155 to a @entity156 to a furniture store			2
it became a music venue in 1978 and was the backdrop for @entity16 's " @entity161 " and @entity163 's " @entity164 " videos			1
other major artists , such as @entity166 and @entity64 , cut their teeth playing to sweaty fans inside the theatre			1
it became the type of venue that gave something to everybody			2
with so many shows that span several genres , any music fan can find their niche			0
on one night , the @entity180 would jam on mellow @entity182 blues			0
another night , @entity183 would blow the roof off with @entity185			0
with this in mind , the owners decided to hold the two - week grand opening to cover the full gamut of musical styles that fully encapsulates the diversity of the theater			1
" what i 've always loved about the @entity7 is that it 's a clean palette that any kind of artist can paint on , " said @entity19			0
@entity92 were among a dozen acts who performed during the grand reopening			1
others included @entity202 and @entity203			1
" it has been fabulous , " @entity19 said of the first weeks of shows			0
" the crowds have been full and the bands have been happy			0
it 's really just gone fantastic ! " the fans have come back in droves , selling out most shows since the reopening			0
the theatre is now able to resume its purpose : giving people a place to just enjoy the music			0
" there 's this real primeval thing about going to a concert , " @entity19 said			0
" i feel like people have been dancing around the fire since we were humans			2
" now , after two years and a massive effort , the dancing has returned .			0
