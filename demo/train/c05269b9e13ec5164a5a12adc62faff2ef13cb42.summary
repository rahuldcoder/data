even " @entity16 " star @entity15 and @entity17 of " @entity18 " weighed in to give their thumbs up			2
" @entity22 " co-host @entity21 offered an assist			2
but not everyone was ready to jump on the ark with this casting decision			0
for the record , this is not the first time this discussion has been had			0
months ago , @entity31 reported that @entity32 was being considered for the @entity14 role as part of a @entity36 - ian recasting , in which different actors would helm the franchise over the years			0
variety writer @entity39 tweeted that @entity3 did n't even know he was under consideration			1
neither the actor nor @entity5 has commented on the speculation			0
what do you think ? would @entity3 be a good choice for the role , or nah ?			1

a report says " @entity7 " star @entity3 is in the *mix* for a new film
there is some fan *support* for it
