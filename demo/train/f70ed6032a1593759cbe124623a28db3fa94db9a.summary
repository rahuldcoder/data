had better take a look at " @entity8			1
" the new film from " @entity17 " siblings @entity11 and @entity12 , and their co-conspirator @entity13 ( " @entity14 " ) , spans centuries and continents , tells six separate stories and casts a dozen actors in three or more roles apiece			1
there is enough ambition and audacity here to fill an entire multiplex , astonishing spectacle and philosophical heft to match			1
it 's a bravura , rogue movie , the kind that has no business getting made			1
does it work ? no , not really -- not for me -- but there is something truly wondrous about a folly on this scale			2
i 'll take it over another efficient cookie - cutter flick any day of the week			2
@entity40 's @entity39 - nominated novel begins midstream , well into what purports to be the diary of an innocent 19th century lawyer traveling the @entity45 in the company of unscrupulous mariners and brigands			2
in a kind of literary relay , this manuscript is devoured by a young apprentice composer in the 1930s , who comments on it in his letters to his male lover			2
letters that turn up 40 years later when the lover -- a nuclear scientist -- is embroiled in a deadly corruption cover - up , which is the basis in turn for a pulp suspense novel read by a cranky @entity65 publisher , and so on and so forth -- all the way into the 23rd century and beyond			2
' @entity8 ' draws mixed reviews from @entity68 by most lights this would qualify as " unfilmable " ( it 's also brilliant - do read it ) , but apparently not			1
the movie adaptation is actually quite faithful , an honest and somewhat successful attempt to visualize @entity40 's shifting epochs and recurring themes			0
it is more fragmented , though			0
where @entity40 explores his stories in large , discreet chunks , the filmmakers have sliced and diced them into far shorter sequences , so that it 's not always clear which century we 're in or what 's going on , or why			0
the tactic is disorienting , but also distracts from how thin some of these stories actually are , once they have been boiled down to narrative essentials			0
six tales in just under three hours -- that 's less than 30 minutes each , not long enough to delve beneath the surface			1
the novel plays with literary form and adopts a different authorial voice for each tale			0
the movie switches between costume drama to comedy to paranoia thriller to sci - fi fantasy , but seems flat in comparison			0
there 's not much momentum or suspense to keep the ship afloat , just a prevailing curiosity about how on earth everything connects			0
we 're invited to pick out correspondences and motifs across the years , from the comet - shaped birthmark that crops up several times to a haunting melody that outlives its composer , as well as wider patterns of prejudice , repression , resistance and rebellion			0
the movie 's politics are strikingly progressive and sophisticated			0
but the filmmakers ' reach often exceeds their grasp			0
@entity130 talks ' @entity8 ' and more what is exhilarating and impressive in the design is often undone in the detail			1
it makes some conceptual sense to cast the same actors in numerous roles -- it implies something about the human struggle and what one character calls " perpetual recurrence " -- but disguised and coated in layers of makeup , the stars ( they include @entity130 , @entity144 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 ) repeatedly default to crass caricature			1
the dramaturgy is frequently jarringly crude and ham - fisted ; frenzied comic relief fails to hit the mark ( @entity40 's very dry , @entity156 sense of humor eludes them )			0
there are fleeting moments of inspiration -- the @entity12 are clearly in their element in the corporatized @entity163 of the not - so distant future -- but a post-apocalyptic episode where everyone speaks an incomprehensible invented pidgin cries out for cutting , and the earliest seafaring tale is also a very long haul			1
in short , " @entity8 " is all over the map : an event movie with vision and brains , it 's also bombastic and ultimately enervating , getting lost in the fog of its own over-arching ambition .			1
