-- president @entity1 announced wednesday night that all the 33,000 additional @entity3 forces he ordered to @entity4 in december 2009 will be home within 15 months			1
in a nationally televised address from the @entity7 of the @entity8 , @entity1 said 10,000 of the " surge " forces would withdraw by the end of this year , and the other 23,000 would leave @entity4 by september 2012			1
at the same time , @entity1 said the drawdown would help the @entity3 begin to refocus attention and resources on efforts to resolve economic and other problems and to unify a politically divided nation			1
here 's how @entity0 analysts reacted to the address : @entity19 , @entity0 security analyst " well , we 've known [ talks with the @entity22 ] have been going on for several months , but certainly as far as i can tell this is the first time the president sort of officially acknowledged it			1
@entity28 did a few days ago			2
president @entity29 was the person who kind of first outed it officially			1
" i think it is a big deal that @entity8 officials i spoke to said that they 're aware of somewhere between 10 and 20 different what they call " leads " into the @entity22			1
they 're sort of doing detective work is what they 're saying , trying to work out if these leads , how legitimate are they			2
" is somebody coming forward as sort of a free agent who really does n't represent senior leadership of the @entity22 , or is it something deeper ? " they are saying they are not starry - eyed about these discussions with the @entity22			1
they do n't expect some @entity48 or some peace agreement on the deck of the @entity51			2
but they are looking at sort of some leads that appear to be fairly substantial			2
that might lead to further negotiation			2
so i think this is newsworthy			0
" @entity59 , @entity0 chief political analyst " this is a president who understands that 56 % of the @entity3 public does not want to be in @entity4			1
and the @entity8 advisers i spoke to today said to me , ' look , if you go back to his speech in december of 2009 , this is a president that people will view as steady			1
' " because he told us what he was going to do when he announced the surge in december 2009			0
and that is exactly what he has done			0
he is claiming some success in diminishing and defeating @entity79 , obviously killing @entity80 helps him with that narrative			0
" and so i think he believes it now			0
he can make the case to the @entity3 public that he can draw down having had some success			0
" but given the fact that we 're spending all this money on this war , that it is usually unpopular			0
i think it 's very difficult to separate what is a military decision from what will become a political decision , you know ? it 's just -- it 's all part and parcel of the same thing			1
" @entity99 , @entity0 senior political analyst " well , he has chosen i think what was called earlier the ' @entity102 strategy			1
' that is there 's some people that want to move out rapidly , some people that want to stay a long time			2
i might choose the middle of that			0
" and overall i thought that this speech did bring into focus -- it was a very good speech -- brought into focus his overall philosophy			0
" you have to say he promised as a candidate early on in his presidency he would wind down the wars in @entity118 and @entity4 and try to do that successfully			1
" and his @entity8 aides were pointing out this afternoon when he came into office he had 196,000 troops deployed			0
by the end of this year we 'll have less than 100,000			0
i think there 's substantial disagreement on how he 's winding down			2
" @entity128 , @entity0 world affairs analyst " i think it 's in keeping with his basic strategic rationale from the start			1
he did announce the surge			0
part of that was , i think , the military boxed him in			2
you remember [ gen. ] @entity140 leaked his recommendation			0
it became very difficult for a @entity144 president to overturn it			1
" but @entity1 has started his presidency saying we are too committed overseas , we are too militarily engaged , we have too large a footprint , we 've got to rebalance , we 've got to focus on nation - building at home			1
we 've got to focus on @entity151			0
and he sounded all those themes			0
" it was a remarkable speech for an @entity3 president in the caution , the strategic emphasis , rather than the idealistic emphasis			1
" he says things like , we must be as pragmatic as we are passionate , as strategic as we are resolute			2
people would have @entity3 overextend itself , confronting every evil that could be found abroad			0
this is reminiscent of a very different strain of @entity3 , in many ways , a strain that goes back before the @entity166			0

@entity168 : president for first time acknowledged talks with @entity22
@entity59 : difficult to separate the military decision from political decision
@entity99 : @entity1 winding down @entity118 , @entity4 wars like he said he would
@entity128 : kept with his basic strategic rationale from the start
