-- baseball is a dirty game , we know that			1
but just how filthy is it ? exactly how many cheaters do we have out there , anyhow ? are there no angels in our outfields ? the hot rumor is @entity18 is about to throw the book -- harder , this time -- at players who allegedly got a boost from performance - enhancing drugs			1
as many as 20 players might be suspended , according to a report on @entity26			1
some of the bans might be for as long as 100 games			2
a feel - good @entity30 fellow named @entity31 ran @entity31 , a @entity33 wellness clinic that is now closed			1
@entity34 says sources indicated @entity31 will be cooperating with @entity18 's top brass in identifying which pro athletes , among his clientele , were being supplied with @entity39			1
names being bandied about : @entity41 , three - time @entity42 ; @entity43 , 2011 @entity42 ; @entity44 , 2012 all - star @entity45 ; and , well , the rest of the lineup will be asked to line up			1
throw the bums out , some will scream			1
i am totally ok with this			2
who 's legitimate and who ai n't ? that 's all we want to know anymore			2
we have spent much of this century wondering which individuals in the national pastime are squeaky clean and which are as stained as a dugout floor			1
what about @entity63 , no. 1 on hitting 's all - time home run list -- and who was convicted in 2011 of obstruction of justice for impeding a grand jury investigating the use of @entity39 ? what about @entity41 ( no. 5 on the list ) , who in 2009 publicly confessed to steroid use between 2001 - 03 ? what about @entity75 ( no. 8 ) , who the @entity76 reported was among the players who tested positive for a performance - enhancing drug in 2003 ? @entity79 ( 10 ) , who in 2010 admitted to steroid use during the 1990s ? @entity81 ( 12 ) , suspended in 2005 for a positive drug test ? @entity83 ( 14 ) , suspended in 2009 for the same thing ? did any or all bring a little " extra " to the plate when they stepped up to bat ? i do n't know			1
all i do know is , we 're sick of it , man			0
baseball 's zero - tolerance policy is an absolute must			1
oh , the players ' union reps will surely react and be appalled and appeal			2
but if swingers and throwers are found to be dirty , they 've got ta go			0
no slaps on the wrist			2
it 's got ta hurt			0
back when he got booted for 50 games in 2009 , @entity83 was a big star			0
he has barely been heard from since			0
@entity83 and his 555 home runs ( more than @entity104 or @entity105 or @entity106 ) have pretty much taken a powder since @entity18 suspended him that season for @entity39			1
when they pointed a finger his way for another possible violation in 2011 , he chose instant retirement instead			0
a couple of strikes and you 're out			0
@entity41 's in a jam			0
his reputation is already in disrepute from his 2009 mea culpa			0
he is 37 and his future is in doubt			0
he is injured and has n't played a single inning for the @entity124 so far in 2013			0
now the 14 - time all - star with 647 lifetime home runs finds his name has come up again in this @entity31 business in @entity33 , the town where he went to high school			1
a 29 - year - old outfielder for the @entity133 , he was @entity134 in 2007 , @entity135 in ' 11			2
then he got suspended for @entity39			2
then he got un-suspended , successfully challenging the decision			0
now he 's on the hot seat again , although he seems adamant that the truth will set him free			0
then there is @entity44 , 28 , the man named @entity44 , whose pals call him " @entity143 , " whose fans in @entity145 came to games dressed like milkmen			2
in 2012 , the @entity148 was hitting a healthy .346 and had just been voted the star of stars in the @entity151 when he got banned 50 games for the detection in his bloodstream of " synthetic testosterone			0
" he missed the rest of the season			0
he was eligible for the @entity158 , but the @entity159 did n't reinstate him			0
a day after they won it , they released @entity44 from the team			0
today he is a @entity164 , persona non grata in the @entity166 where he was once so wildly popular			0
a second suspension could be in store for @entity44 if reports are correct that he could be snagged in the @entity33 net			2
@entity34 ran a long list of players besides @entity41 , @entity43 and @entity44 " who might ultimately face discipline			1
" a couple of these guys are among @entity18 's fastest - rising young stars			1
guilty parties , you know who you are			1
@entity18 , you are slowly but surely figuring out who they are			1
get out your pail and mop			0
if you have found more dirt by your plate , do this game a big favor			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			1

@entity191 : @entity34 reports as many as 20 baseball players could get suspended for @entity195 use
he says this time , @entity18 should throw book at *offenders* , not slap wrist . fans tired of this
he says years of steroid - use cases have *ruined* *careers* , stained the game .
@entity191 : guilty parties , you know who you are ; @entity18 , if you find dirt , clean it up
