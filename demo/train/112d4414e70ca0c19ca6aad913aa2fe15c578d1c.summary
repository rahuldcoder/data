-- it 's a 1 - 0 victory to the @entity2 in an age when major nations are doing battle for football 's brightest talents , the @entity2 team has pulled off quite a coup			1
@entity10 is a dual @entity2 and @entity11 citizen who has been playing for @entity12 in @entity13 since 2010			1
the 18 - year - old winger 's displays since making his debut for @entity12 's second team in 2013 have been enough to convince @entity2 coach @entity18 to offer @entity10 the chance to represent the country of his birth			1
but the @entity23 - born starlet has already represented @entity13 at youth level , meaning football 's global governing body @entity25 had to clear @entity10 to play for @entity18 's team			1
on monday @entity25 did just that , meaning there is nothing stopping @entity18 from handing @entity10 his international debut against @entity31 on april 2 and subsequently taking him to the @entity32 in @entity33			1
" we are obviously thrilled , " @entity18 told @entity2 soccer 's official website			0
" we appreciate @entity25 's effort in getting his paperwork approved , and are excited to have him on board for the game against @entity31 on april 2			1
" blog : " your country needs you ! " but which country ? cases like @entity10 's are becoming increasingly common			0
in february @entity47 handed a debut to striker @entity49			1
the @entity51 star has dazzled observers this season , firing his club to the top of the @entity57 first division with 23 goals in 27 games			0
@entity49 looks likely to spearhead @entity47 's defense of its @entity32 crown later this year , an ironic twist given the tournament will take place in his homeland			2
not only was @entity49 born in @entity66 , @entity33 , he played for the country of his birth on two occasions in march 2013			2
but in september of that year the @entity57 federation requested @entity49 be allowed to play for @entity47 after he had been granted @entity57 citizenship			2
@entity25 obliged @entity47 's request , much to the chagrin of @entity33 's football authorities			0
@entity76 youngster @entity75 is another player who could spark an international incident			0
the winger , who impressed upon breaking into the @entity76 first team earlier this season , was born in in @entity81 , @entity82 and is also eligible to play for @entity83			0
the @entity84 was thought to be exploring whether @entity75 would be eligible to play for @entity85 , while the @entity86 would also call upon the 19 - year - old should it ever be permitted to play competitively			0
like @entity10 before him , it seems likely that @entity75 will have to pledge his allegiance sooner rather than later .			0
