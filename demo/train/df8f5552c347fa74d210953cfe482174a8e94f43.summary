@entity1 's immigration issue needs a comprehensive and permanent bipartisan legislative solution			1
an executive action is a temporary and limited fix			1
on the night president @entity6 announced his most recent immigration executive action , i called it a @entity9			1
today , we found out , the @entity9 may not stick			2
in a case brought by 26 states , a federal judge in @entity14 issued an injunction halting implementation of the president 's executive actions : the @entity19 for parents of @entity1 and @entity21 ( or @entity22 ) -- which would have granted work permits and extended deferred deportation status and expanded the the @entity25 ( @entity25 ) program for undocumented immigrants who arrived in the @entity1 as children			1
what the immigration ruling means this is just the beginning of the legal wrangling over this			0
at issue is whether president @entity6 exceeded his powers and tried to legislate			2
this is @entity37 ' job , and the problem , to state the obvious , is that @entity37 is not doing it			1
for decades , @entity37 has been talking about fixing the broken immigration system			1
on the other side , you have mounting pressure on president @entity6 from an increasingly frustrated @entity46 community and @entity48 base			2
he made pie - in - the - sky campaign promises offering immigration reform in his first year in office			0
in his first two years , he had a @entity48 @entity52 and @entity53			0
he had the chance to act			0
instead , he sat on his hands as the problem continued to fester			0
what 's worse , as part of the fight over the immigration executive actions , the @entity37 is now playing a game of chicken with the @entity64 's appropriations bill , set to expire in a few days , insisting on amendments to the bill that would block @entity6 's immigration actions			1
@entity68 emboldened after immigration ruling lastly , add to this equation the reality of the millions of confused undocumented families whose lives and livelihoods are in the balance , and who have no idea how this is going to end			0
the truth is , none of us do			0
frankly , the entire thing is a hot , ugly , mess			1
the president should use this judge 's injunction as an opportunity to invite and pressure @entity37 to work with him on a bipartisan solution			1
halt the implementation of the immigration program			2
halt the irresponsible posturing on funding @entity64			0
set a deadline to pass legislation			0
fix the immigration problem comprehensively , permanently and fairly .			0

@entity98 : @entity100 's halt to @entity6 's executive actions on immigration *reveal* they were always a @entity9
she says @entity37 must do its job and craft a *bi-partisan* fix to the hot , ugly mess of @entity1 's immigration *policy*
