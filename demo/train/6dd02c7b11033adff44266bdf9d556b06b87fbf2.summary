editor 's note : @entity2 served as comptroller general of the @entity4 and head of the @entity6 from 1998 to 2008			1
he is now president and ceo of the @entity8			0
@entity2 says the federal debt could double , forcing huge increases in your taxes			1
( @entity13 ) -- even under the best of economic circumstances , tax season is a tense time for @entity4 households			2
the number of hours we collectively spend working on our returns is probably a lot more than government agencies claim			2
the burden in financial terms is even greater : a recent independent survey found that the average @entity4 's total federal , state and local tax bill roughly equals his or her entire earnings from january 1 up until right before tax day			1
now imagine that tax bill doubling over time			2
in recent years , the federal government has spent more money than it takes in at an increasing rate			2
total federal debt almost doubled during president @entity40 's administration and , as much as we needed some stimulus spending to boost the economy , the nonpartisan @entity37 now estimates total debt levels could almost double again over the next eight years based on the budget recently outlined by president @entity46			1
regardless of what politicians tell you , any additional accumulations of debt are , absent dramatic reductions in the size and role of government , basically deferred tax increases			1
remember the old saw ? " you can pay me now or you can pay me later , with interest			0
" to help put things in perspective , the @entity8 calculated the federal government accumulated $ 56.4 trillion in total liabilities and unfunded promises for @entity66 and @entity67 as of september 30 , 2008			2
the numbers used to calculate this figure come directly from the audited financial statements of the @entity4 government			2
if $ 56.4 trillion in financial commitments is too big a number to digest , think of it as $ 483,000 per @entity4 household , or $ 184,000 for every man , woman and child in the country			0
even broken down , the numbers can be tough to swallow			0
yes , you 've paid your taxes , but you still bear a significant share of the government 's own financial burden			1
to help this news go down with a smile , the @entity8 is supporting a campaign designed to help @entity4 understand what @entity89 is doing to us , rather than for us			0
@entity92 ( www.owenandpayne.com ) , partners in a fictional accounting firm that specializes in helping @entity4 fill out the " new " form 483000 , which spells out how our elected officials are putting our nation into more and more debt and how that bill eventually will have to be paid : by doubling your taxes			1
the campaign is all in fun , but the intent is very serious			0
unless we begin to get our fiscal house in order , there 's simply no other way to handle our ever - mounting debt burdens except by doubling taxes over time			1
otherwise , our growing commitments for @entity66 and @entity67 benefits will gradually squeeze out spending on other vital programs such as education , research and development , and infrastructure			0
personal savings , while experiencing an uptick lately because of the recession , have been too low for too long			0
as a result , when our government has to borrow money , it must increasingly turn to lenders overseas			0
effectively addressing these issues will require tough choices and comprehensive reforms , including budget controls , changes to our entitlement programs , reductions in health care costs , other spending cuts , and yes , tax increases			1
but as the old saw goes , paying now , or paying soon , wo n't be as painful as paying later			0
so as you file your tax returns this year , bear in mind that no matter how much you 're paying now , you 'll pay much more in the future because of @entity89 's failure to get its finances in order			1
if you do n't like the idea , then get informed and get involved			0
and by listening rather than punishing , help encourage our elected officials to speak the truth about our financial condition , even if it means reforming entitlements , cutting spending , and yes , raising taxes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : if you 've survived filing your taxes , you still have to worry
he says the nation 's debt is *unsustainable* and will require tax increases
he says *people* should urge government to get fiscal house in order
