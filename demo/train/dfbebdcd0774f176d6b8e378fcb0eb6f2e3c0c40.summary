@entity0 -- catholic faithful from around the world poured into @entity4 on sunday as the @entity5 declares pope @entity6 " blessed , " a step below sainthood			1
there were cheers as pope @entity11 personally beatified his predecessor , and a huge tapestry protrait of @entity6 was unveiled , showing him as the healthy , vigorous and relatively young man he was early in his papacy			1
a vial of @entity6 's blood was placed before the crowds , which were expected to be the largest in the @entity0 since the late pope 's funeral in 2005			1
the blood , which was taken from him by doctors during his final illness for possible transfusion , but never used , was displayed in a specially made silver reliquary			1
@entity28 came requests -- first in @entity30 and then @entity31 -- that people put down their banners and flags , and pray silently			0
" in heaven a very different celebration is taking place among the angels and saints ! " @entity11 declared in his homily			0
the current pope echoed the many who credit the @entity31 - born pope with playing a key role in the defeat of @entity46 , saying he turned " back with the strength of a titan -- a strength which came to him from @entity50 -- a tide which appeared irreversible			0
" @entity6 made a pilgrimage to his native land , then part of the @entity56 - dominated communist bloc , shortly after his election in 1978 , and an estimated one third of the entire nation turned out to see him			1
" do n't be afraid , " he exhorted them			0
@entity31 's solidarity union sprang up soon after , and became the most organized and powerful @entity63 movement in the @entity56 bloc			0
many commentators said @entity6 helped inspire the movement , which ultimately toppled @entity31 's @entity55 government in 1989			1
@entity6 's path to sainthood @entity11 on sunday also praised @entity6 's iron will in the face of his physical decline later in his life , saying , " the @entity75 gradually stripped him of everything , yet he remained ever a ' rock , ' as @entity78 desired			1
" more than a million pilgrims turned out in @entity4 , police said			1
many in the throng waved @entity31 flags and holding images of @entity6 , who was archbishop of @entity85 in @entity31 before being elected pope			2
the presidents of @entity89 and @entity31 were among 16 heads of state at the mass , alongside seven prime ministers , the @entity87 said			0
there were also big crowds in @entity85 for the event , where at least 50,000 people braved pouring rain at the @entity98 in @entity99			0
for those who could n't make it to @entity4 or @entity85 , the @entity87 created a special @entity103 feed for the event , @ @entity105			0
it also launched a @entity107 page for it , and streamed it live to iphones and @entity110 through @entity111			0
having visiting more countries than any previous pope and becoming the first pontiff from outside of @entity89 in 450 years , @entity6 also was the third - longest reigning pope in history			2
@entity5 honor @entity6 in @entity117 , @entity118 the @entity87 suggests he was seen in person by more than anyone else in human history , between his 104 foreign trips , the roughly 17 million pilgrims who attended weekly audiences with him at the @entity0 over his long reign , and the millions more who saw him at special events in @entity4			1
did you encounter pope @entity6 ? there were demands for his immediate canonization when he died , with crowds chanting " @entity133 , " or " @entity134 now			2
" but the late pope has critics as well as supporters , particularly among those who accuse him of not doing enough to stop the abuse of children by catholic clergy			1
the @entity141 ( @entity141 ) vowed to protest at 70 churches in seven countries sunday , callingthe fast - tracking of pontiff 's sainthood " a callous pr juggernaut honoring the man who presided over much of the ongoing crisis			1
" but @entity6 's former spokesman , @entity149 , told @entity1 he had no doubt he had been in the presence of a saint			1
@entity153 cited not only the pope 's devotion at prayer , but his concern for others , noting that when the pope called him after the death of his father , his first question was : " how is your mother ? " he also recalled the pope 's informality , saying he sometimes had to remind himself that he was in the presence of the pope			2
and he said for the pope to retain his " good humor " at the age of 80 , in the face of his weighty office and his physical suffering , " is sanctity to me			0
" the pope 's photographer @entity6 was fast - tracked to beatification when he died in 2005 , and becomes " the blessed " @entity6 barely six years after his death -- the fastest beatification in centuries			1
@entity153 rejected the idea that the process was moving too fast to let history be the judge of @entity6 , saying canonization could take centuries			2
" once the virtues are clear , why wait ? " he asked			0
for beatification , a person must be credited with a miracle by the @entity5			2
@entity11 ruled last year that @entity6 had miraculously cured a @entity192 nun of @entity193 after his death			2
the pope himself suffered from the condition			0
the nun , @entity197 , was one of two nuns who brought the silver reliquary with the blood to @entity11 after @entity6 was beatified			1
@entity201 , who worked in the late pope 's household , was the other			1
the blood is still liquid because doctors added anti-coagulents to it when it was taken			0
the @entity5 tradition of venerating saints ' physical remains -- known as relics -- dates to the earliest days of the church			2
@entity214 family credits pope @entity6 with personal miracle @entity6 's coffin has also been removed from its tomb and is on display for the faithful to venerate this weekend			1
to become saint , @entity6 would need to perform a second miracle			0
the man named by @entity6 to be archbishop of @entity225 in @entity226 died on the eve of the beatification , the archdiocese announced sunday			0
@entity229 , who was later promoted to cardinal by @entity11 , was found dead in his room in @entity4 at the age of 80 , having watched preparations for the beatification the night before			0
