-- there is no reason @entity3 should spend the next 20 years in prison			1
if you are the most hardened law - and - order person in the world , even you should have some compassion for @entity9 , the @entity10 , @entity11 , woman who has been struck by the ridiculous @entity11 law known as 10 - 20 - life			1
the law requires anyone convicted of an aggravated assault when a firearm is discharged to serve a minimum of 20 years in prison with no regard to extenuating circumstances			1
@entity9 says that on august 1 , 2010 , her husband went into a rage and tried to strangle her after reading some text messages she sent to her ex-husband			2
she fled the family home , got to the garage and realized she did n't have her keys			0
fearing for her life , she says she grabbed a gun and went back into the home to retrieve her keys			0
she says her husband threatened to kill her , and to keep him at bay , she fired a warning shot into a wall			2
why was she charged , convicted and sentenced ? because state attorney @entity42 , the same prosecutor leading the @entity44 case , said the gun was fired near a bedroom where two children were and they could have been injured			1
did the bullet hit the children ? no. did @entity9 point the gun at her husband and hit him ? no. she simply fired a warning shot , and according to @entity11 's shameful law , that 's enough for a minimum 20 - year sentence			1
@entity57 offered @entity9 a three - year sentence in a plea bargain , but @entity9 felt she had done nothing wrong and so rejected the plea			2
in sentencing her , the judge made it clear that , despite all the pleas for mercy , including one from @entity9 's 11 - year - old daughter who took the stand , he was left with no choice but to send @entity9 to jail for at least 20 years			1
@entity9 tried to invoke @entity11 's controversial stand your ground law in her defense , but that was rejected			2
critics of the law 's role in the @entity44 case have said this shows how the law is applied unevenly			2
but the real issue here is n't the faulty stand your ground law			0
it 's the ridiculous mandatory minimum sentences that have been approved by countless state legislatures and @entity88			0
in 2007 , the @entity90 @entity89 ruled ( @entity91 ) that the federal sentencing guidelines in some types of cases should not be seen as mandatory but as " advisory , " giving judges the leeway ( @entity91 ) to consider multiple factors before sentencing someone			1
in a 2003 speech to the @entity102 , @entity89 @entity100 railed against federal mandatory minimums , saying , " our resources are misspent , our punishment too severe , our sentences too long			1
" " i can accept neither the necessity nor the wisdom of federal mandatory minimum sentences , " @entity100 said			0
" in too many cases , mandatory minimum sentences are unwise or unjust			0
" unfortunately , on the state level , far too many law - and - order legislators , most with no courtroom or law enforcement experience , enact such laws without giving any thought to potential cases like @entity9 's			1
the 10 - 20 - life policy has no business in the laws of @entity11 or any other state			0
judges should have the discretion to consider a variety of factors in sentencing , and i have no doubt had this judge been given flexibility , @entity9 would n't be going to prison for 20 years			1
these types of injustices are common in our legal system , and it is necessary for everyone with a conscience to stand up and decry these so - called legislative remedies that end up as nightmares			0
@entity9 was a woman trying to flee an enraged husband			0
she could have easily pointed the gun at him and pleaded self - defense , and like @entity148 , the shooter in the @entity44 case who was not initially charged , @entity9 might never have been arrested			1
our prison systems are overcrowded , and folks like @entity3 do not belong in them			0
one hopes that @entity11 gov. @entity155 will find some compassion and grant @entity9 a pardon , and the @entity158 will revise the law to prevent future miscarriages of justice			2
@entity11 elected officials and residents should be ashamed of this law and do all they can to change it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity168 .			0

@entity168 : @entity3 a victim of mandatory minimums
@entity9 , who fired a gun into a wall , has been sentenced to 20 years
@entity44 says laws that prevent leeway in sentencing should be *abolished*
