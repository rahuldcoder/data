-- in what activists call a victory for @entity6 , the @entity2 government has resolved allegations relating to a series of warrantless home raids by immigration agents and must now follow new guidelines for conducing similar operations in the future			1
the terms were part of a federal court settlement approved on thursday in @entity17 between @entity18 ( @entity18 ) and nearly two dozen plaintiffs who joined in a class - action suit			1
the suit that was closely watched by immigrant communities who alleged @entity18 agents forced their way into eight homes of @entity29 families on @entity17 's @entity30 in 2006 and 2007 without legal justification			1
" this is a positive step in the ability to hold @entity18 officers accountable for misconduct , " said @entity32 , founder of @entity33 , a nonprofit immigrant - rights filmmaker			2
" we hope officers and the agency are wise enough to not ignore the decision			0
but this is not enough			0
this is just the beginning of change that needs to be done			0
" the lead plaintiff , @entity45 , said agents pounded on doors in the middle of the night and came into her @entity50 home even though they were denied entry			1
she shared the home with her parents , siblings and children , who are all @entity2 citizens			2
" @entity18 is known for tactics like showing up unexpectedly and banging on doors , a common strategy that has been employed fairly routinely , " said @entity56 , director of training and technical assistance at the @entity58			0
" but now with this change in federal policy , hopefully people 's basic constitutional rights wo n't be violated			0
" under revised guidelines for cases without warrants , @entity18 must establish a policy requiring that agents , when feasible , obtain permission to enter a home in a language residents can understand			1
there are also new restrictions for when searches can be conducted on property surrounding a home			2
the government , as part of the settlement , also agreed to pay $ 1 million and drop or put aside immigration proceedings in several cases related to the raids			1
" undocumented immigrants have less rights than @entity2 citizens would but they do have basic constitutional protection that gives them the right to be protected from unreasonable search and seizure , " explained @entity56			0
@entity18 declined to comment on the settlement			2
@entity0 's @entity94 contributed to this report .			0
