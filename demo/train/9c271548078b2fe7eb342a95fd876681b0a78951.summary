some years ago , i appeared on a well - known television talk show opposite four " angry white men " : four men who believed they had been discriminated against in the workplace by affirmative action programs initiated , they argued , by feminist women			1
each man told his story of how he was qualified for a job or qualified for a promotion that he did not get because of this putative reverse discrimination against white men			2
one ended his remarks with a line that served as the title for this show : " a black woman stole my job , " he declared			0
asked to respond , i had but one question for these guys , a question about the title of the show			0
actually , my question was about one word in the title of the show			0
i wanted to know about the word " my			0
" why did the men think it was their job ? why was n't the title of the show " a black woman got a job " or " a black woman got the job " ? the answer , i argued , was that these men felt entitled to the position , and that any effort to make the workplace more equal was perceived , by those men , as a loss			2
i thought of those men recently while reading @entity46 's addled rant against feminist women as the source of the unhappiness that saturates male - female relationships			1
i thought of how painful it is when you are used to having everything to now have only 80 %			0
what a loss ! poor us ! equality sucks when you 've been on top -- and men have been on top for so long that we think it 's a level playing field			1
in her screed against women , she argues that women are their own worst enemy , and that the rise of women has caused the " end of men , " that men are wilting into angry , resentful bachelorhood because women are demanding so much from men			1
they 're emasculating men , confounding their dna , which seeks only to provide and protect			2
women are n't letting men be men			1
women , @entity46 writes , have been seduced by feminists into pushing men off their pedestal to " take what they were taught to believe was rightfully theirs			1
" as a result , @entity46 continues , women have come to believe the adage " women good / men bad " -- an equation that has " destroyed the relationship between the sexes			1
" men , she tells us , are " tired of being told that if women are n't happy , it 's men 's fault			1
" but she is actually arguing that if men are n't happy , it 's women 's fault -- for seeking the very same exhilarating sense of autonomy and selfhood that men claim as our natural entitled birthright			1
how dare they ? ok , so what 's wrong with this picture ? this unhinged argument fuses dreadful history with empirically baseless contemporary analysis			2
the result can not help but be bad politics			0
this notion of good women / bad men has been the foundation not of feminism but of anti-feminism since the 19th century			1
those innocent " angels in the house " were supposed to soothe the savage beast , as men were prone to bouts of rage , drunkenness and other depravities			1
if women did n't tame men , the anti-feminists argued , all hell would break loose			1
pop psychologists joined the pundits to argue , as does @entity46 , that if women are unhappy , it 's their own damned fault			1
how many advice columns about " the rules , " admonitions about the man shortage or effusive media prostration before three or four upper - class white female @entity136 grads who " opted out " ( only to rejoin the workforce when their children were 5 years old ) must we endure ? countless			0
one need n't be original to be wrong			0
in fact , feminism reversed the @entity143 offers			0
it encouraged women to be bad girls -- to seek their own pleasures , to go for it , autonomously , to leave unhappy marriages , and to control their own bodies			0
and it encouraged men to be good -- demanded it , in fact -- insisting that men can and should step up as equal parents , colleagues and coworkers , that we stop the rape and violence that so compromised women 's equality			1
and the empirical evidence suggests that men are quietly adapting to a very new landscape			0
most of the 400 young men ( aged 16 - 26 ) who i interviewed for my book " @entity173 " assume , without resentment , that their wives will be as fully committed to their careers as they are			0
why ? because they 'll need the income			0
and they assume , with no resentment , that they will be involved fathers , spending far more time with their families than their parents or grandparents ever did			0
why ? because they actually want to be involved dads			0
they all have friends of the opposite sex ( " @entity195 's " dictum to the contrary ) , which bodes well for their ability to be more equal coworkers and colleagues with women they consider their peers			2
there 's no war between the sexes			2
men and women can , and should , be allies			2
and they are becoming more equal , and happier , every single day			0
men are n't nearly as unhappy or resentful as @entity46 suggests -- because she only talks to those who feel themselves so entitled that they lament , as did @entity204 , that the re-election of president @entity206 was the loss of " our country			1
" truth is , in her efforts to exalt men , she actually insults us			2
who says we ca n't be happy with fully equal female colleagues and coworkers ? who says we ca n't enjoy the joys of shared parenthood ? who says that we are biologically programmed to be both rapacious testosterone - driven animals and lazy remote - hogging couch potatoes unable to lift a finger in the kitchen ? @entity46 paints a most unyieldlingly awful portrait of men , one that is happily belied by actual , real , @entity230 men			1
and we wo n't stand for the sort of male - bashing @entity46 offers			2
we want it all also -- and the only way we can have it all is to halve it all			0

@entity46 's opinion *article* on a supposed " war on men " *ruffled* *feathers* this week
*sociologist* @entity245 counters that efforts at **social** equality are not a war on men
men are *accustomed* to **social** dominance , @entity245 says , but *society* is *evolving* for the better
a sense of entitlement may lead some men to sulk when women *succeed* , he says
