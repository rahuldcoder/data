@entity1 , @entity2 they say no one can resist its chicuembo , an invocation to the ancestral spirits			1
it will get you off your seat			0
it will get you dancing			0
the magic happens when you listen to @entity13 , @entity2 's distinctive national music , an energetic mix of local dance rhythms and folk music from @entity18			1
the word itself is derived from the @entity22 verb rebentar , meaning " to break "			2
some say this refers to the instruments used to play the music , originally tin - can guitars and wooden boxes with strings			1
due to the flimsy nature of their improvised construction , they were particularly prone to breaking			0
others suggest it describes the dancing style : sprightly , bouncy , best approached with a " dance until you break " attitude			0
but according to @entity40 , an 85 - year - old @entity13 legend whose career can be traced back to 1938 , it was his very showmanship that spawned the term : his intensity on stage was such that it could break the emotional barrier with the audience			1
whatever the truth , @entity13 has a meaning in @entity2 that goes well beyond words			1
@entity2 was a @entity22 colony until 1975 , when it gained its independence after a decade - long war			1
during the colonial period , the regime extended its influence to the arts and culture , demanding that only @entity22 music be played and danced to			1
music therefore became a means of self - expression and conservation of cultural identity for many @entity2			1
@entity13 was born in the late 1930s , and on top of classic themes like love and everyday life , it also offered social criticism and commentary to major events			2
the lyrics are often in @entity22 , still the official language of @entity2 , but also in local languages such as @entity74 and @entity75			1
its musical pattern merges @entity79 influences and local styles , from @entity2 as well as neighboring countries			2
the originators of @entity13 were ordinary @entity2 men and women , who played guitar and sang at gatherings			1
but what really defines the genre is not the rhythm , the guitar , or the language : " what defines @entity13 is the dance , " says @entity40 , " the dance has its own steps			1
it has its own style			0
there is also a specific way to play the music			0
the singing must match the dance and the melody			0
that is what shows you it 's @entity13			2
" @entity13 's undisputed superstar of this generation is @entity110 , " the @entity111 of @entity2 "			1
at the @entity112 in 2013 she won several awards including @entity114 and @entity115 , confirming that the genre has n't lost its luster			2
" i have also performed other styles besides @entity13 , but @entity13 is where i find myself			2
because i 'm @entity121 , because i 'm @entity2 , " says @entity110			1
" and i 've realized that other artists have n't explored this music genre much			2
it used to be seen as though it belonged to older generations			0
as a style , it was made by older artists			0
so i want to break with that			0
" @entity13 is well known beyond @entity2 's borders , but for some artists there 's still more to be done before it can gain international stature			1
" we do n't want our music to reach @entity2 only , " says @entity136 , one of @entity13 's most influential artists			1
" we want our music to be known in all corners of the world			0
but we have n't reached that goal yet , because we do n't have a recording industry			0
" we are fighting to make it known , to publicize it			0
but we realize we also need to establish an industry , we need good promoters , people to take our music to where we want it to go			0
" @entity13 might represent the tradition of @entity2 music , but it 's also strongly influencing its future			1
a new style , popular with the youngest generations , is a mix of @entity13 and @entity156			2
one if its up - and - coming stars is a man who goes by many names : mr @entity161 , mr @entity162 , owner of " @entity163 " , " @entity164 " , and " @entity165			0
" he defines @entity166 as " a fusion between @entity13 , some hip - hop , and some rhythms from our neighbor @entity173 ... some national and international dances			1
we create a pleasant fusion , the @entity166 style that is ours			0
" @entity166 has more groove , it 's more aggressive , and it 's richer in scope , incorporating additional instruments on top of @entity13 's guitars and drums			1
it is just a decade old , but it 's gathering followers rapidly			0
and yet , this does n't mean that @entity13 will soon be a thing of the past			2
it 's all still there			0
deeply etched into the groove			0
watch : @entity2 's elusive coffee plant more : in @entity2 , art from weapons and rubble			2

@entity13 is the distinctive national music of @entity2
originally played with tin - can guitars at gatherings , it combines @entity22 folk with @entity2 dance rhythms
@entity110 , one of the genre 's most popular artists , had the best selling album of the year in @entity2 in 2013
a derivative genre called @entity209 is also gaining popularity among the country 's youth
