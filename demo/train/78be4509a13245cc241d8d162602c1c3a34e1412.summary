next up : the debt ceiling			1
the @entity1 continues to issue dire warnings about the economic consequences should @entity4 fail to raise the debt ceiling this month			1
president @entity6 told @entity7 to be " concerned " and treasury secretary @entity8 said @entity4 is " playing with fire			2
" but despite all the drastic pronouncements , some republicans in @entity4 are n't buying it			1
for one thing , they doubt that october 17 is the date when the @entity14 will be unable to meet its obligations			0
rep. @entity16 , @entity17 , is one of those lawmakers			0
" for him to just put out the 17th as a drop - dead date , i do n't think there 's a lot of credibility to that			2
i do n't think a lot of my peers and i believe in that , " @entity16 recently told @entity26			2
@entity8 said sunday on @entity26 's " @entity30 " that he has exhausted all of the " extraordinary measures " he employed when the debt limit was reached in may			1
" i have no more			0
that means that on october 17th , we 'll run out of the ability to borrow , " he said			0
he said he will have only $ 30 billion to pay as much as $ 50 billion or $ 60 billion worth of daily bills			2
@entity8 also warned in a recent news release that default would be " unprecedented and has the potential to be catastrophic			0
" he said : " [ c ] redit markets could freeze , the value of the dollar could plummet , and @entity45 interest rates could skyrocket , potentially resulting in a financial crisis and recession that could echo the events of 2008 or worse			2
" house speaker @entity49 demands cuts for debt limit increase but many conservatives doubt that , too			1
" we do n't expect there to be chaos , " @entity16 said			2
coming catastrophe or ' false demagoguery ' ? rep. @entity58 of @entity59 recently called the threat of default " false demagoguery			1
" " i do n't think the credit of the @entity45 is going to be collapsed			2
i think that all this talk about a default has been a lot of demagoguery , a lot of false demagoguery , " he added			1
the lawmakers ' skepticism echoes a distrust of the government that runs deep in both liberal and conservative constituencies			2
but with a @entity76 president , conservatives ' skepticism is more pronounced			0
according to a september @entity26 / @entity80 poll , a slight majority of @entity78 -- 52 % -- said it would be a good thing for the country if the debt ceiling is not lifted while only 18 % of @entity76 said so			1
while @entity78 are more skeptical of the @entity6 administration 's posturing , the administration is n't totally sure what will happen if the debt ceiling is not lifted			1
when asked what would happen on october 18 if @entity4 does n't act , @entity8 told @entity26 's @entity91 on sunday that he " ca n't tell you			2
" " we 've never gotten to the point where the @entity45 government has operated without the ability to borrow , " he said			0
there lies the central tenet			0
because the @entity45 has always lifted the debt ceiling when the borrowing limit was tapped , no one knows for sure what impact it would have			1
constitution and the debt : can the president go it alone ? @entity76 sen. @entity108 of @entity109 even said that " no one 's certain " what the economic fallout would be			0
but he added on @entity26 's " @entity113 " on monday , that " no one should risk it and no one should say i want my political agenda attached to it			0
" but some conservatives are willing to take the risk and force the president 's hand on the health care law and reducing government spending			0
a coalition of conservative tea party - aligned groups , including @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 have spent more than a year cultivating a plan to push for the defunding of the health care law , the @entity123 , according to the @entity122			0
as the stalemate over government funding has become interspersed with the debt limit fight , another log has been added to the fire			1
by the numbers : shutdown and debt ceiling tempting fate or a bargaining chip ? @entity78 rep. @entity78 said the debt limit should be used as a bargaining chip for less spending			1
" why would you pass a debt limit ... without doing something about the deficit ? " he asked rhetorically on " @entity146 " on monday			1
he pointed to the 2011 debate over the debt limit that reduced the deficit from $ 1 trillion to $ 700 billion			1
" we 're saying we should do the same thing now , " @entity78 added			0
additionally , some @entity78 see the debt limit fight as an opportunity to not only shrink the size of government but also to pay off interest			1
@entity161 sen. @entity161 of @entity162 said the @entity45 could meet its obligations without lifting the debt ceiling			1
" i would dispel the rumor that is going around that you hear on every newscast that if we do n't raise the debt ceiling we will default on our debt , " @entity161 said monday on @entity171 ' " this morning			1
" " we wo n't			0
we will continue to pay our interest			2
we 'll continue to redeem bonds and we 'll issue new bonds to replace those			0
" what @entity161 does n't mention is that the @entity45 would have to choose to pay its interest over the billions of dollars of other obligations -- @entity180 , @entity181 , etc. -- for which the federal government is responsible			1
@entity8 , however , said that 's a " dangerous " and " reckless " notion			0
" [ @entity185 ] he reality is , there are no good choices if we run out of borrowing capacity and we run out of cash , " he said			0
4 debt ceiling scenarios freaking out traders most economists tend to agree with @entity8 's assessment			1
@entity196 's economist @entity195 told the @entity197 recently that the economy " would quickly fall into another severe recession " if the debt ceiling is not lifted in adequate time			1
which side is right ? before default is reached , it 's hard to know			0
but a recent study published in @entity206 found that people on the far end of the political spectrum believe that their positions are " correct			0
" " given the stalemate in @entity214 , understanding why people become so entrenched in their views â € ” even when there is not an objectively correct answer â € ” is more important than ever , " @entity211 , a postdoctoral fellow at @entity212 , said , describing why she conducted the study			0
@entity7 could be the biggest indicator of who is right in this fight			1
investors nervous over the political impasse in @entity214 pushed all three major @entity45 stock indexes lower on monday			0
the @entity224 alone lost more than 130 points , or nearly 1 percent of its value .			0

@entity228 continues to issue dire warnings about consequences about debt ceiling
some republicans in @entity4 are n't buying it ; one calls it " false demagoguery "
*critics* see the debt limit fight as an opportunity to shrink the size of government and pay off interest
the financial markets could be the biggest indicator of who is right in this fight
