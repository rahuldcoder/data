@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 presidential candidate @entity3 emerged victorious in the first election returns of the 2008 presidential race , winning 15 of 21 votes cast in @entity0 , @entity1			1
people in the isolated village in @entity1 's northeast corner voted just after midnight tuesday			2
it was the first time since 1968 that the village leaned @entity4 in an election			0
@entity3 's rival , @entity15 @entity14 , won 6 votes			1
a full 100 percent of registered voters in the village cast ballots			0
and the votes did n't take long to tally			0
the town , home to around 75 residents , has opened its polls shortly after midnight each election day since 1960 , drawing national media attention for being the first place in the country to make its presidential preferences known			0
however , since 1996 , another small @entity1 town -- @entity32 -- reinstated its practice from the 1940s and also began opening its polls at midnight			1
the result in @entity0 is hardly a reliable bellwether for the eventual winner of the @entity38 or even the result statewide			1
though @entity1 is a perennial swing state , @entity0 -- until now -- had consistently leaned @entity15			2
the last @entity40 it picked was @entity42 over @entity43 in 1968			0
president @entity44 won the town in a landslide in the last two elections : he captured 73 percent of the vote in 2004 ( 19 residents picked @entity44 while six preferred sen. @entity50 ) , and secured 80 percent of the vote in 2000 ( 21 votes for @entity44 , five votes for @entity53			2
) but villagers expected the results to be close this year given @entity4 now outnumber @entity15 there			0
the town picked both @entity14 and @entity3 for the @entity1 @entity4 and @entity15 primaries in january			1
@entity14 ultimately won the state of @entity1 , while sen. @entity60 upset @entity3 there .			1

new : the results -- 15 votes for @entity3 , six for @entity14
@entity0 , @entity1 , residents cast the first votes on @entity67
voters began casting their ballots at *12* a.m. tuesday *morning*
the town has hardly been a reliable bellwether for picking the president
