-- when i try to explain my ardor for @entity6 's trashy - fabulous soap opera " @entity7 " to my dude friends , they either shrug and change the topic , or question whether i 've been writing for ladyblogs for too long and am suffering from a form of @entity13			1
dudes just do n't dig bloodsuckers , since vampires pretty much look like girls			0
we prefer zombies , because we love chainsaws , flamethrowers , and samurai swords			1
and because , on some level , we know that besides being vehicles for sperm , our other important , if lesser , genetic imperative is to defend our loved ones from hordes of unthinking , flesh - eating metaphors for current social anxieties			2
to most guys , vampires are the monster movie equivalent of that sensitive man - sponge in college who plays acoustic guitar in order to seduce chicks			1
they 're what you get when you cross your average @entity43 enthusiast with a mosquito			0
and what 's with their greatest weaknesses being most kinds of @entity50 food , @entity51 , and the sun , which helps flowers grow ? really ? why women find date - rapey parasites who wear capes compelling must have something to do with deeply primal fears			1
a vampire is a monster , who looks , acts , and talks like a man			1
who is passionate , romantic , and tortured			0
to surrender to this character is to play with fire			0
the vampire , in many ways , is the prototype of the bad boy			1
women love bad boys - they 're exciting , and the chance to change him , to break him like a horse , must be an irresistible challenge			1
if self - destruction were n't seductive on some superficial level , then no one would ever need rehab			2
but i am like most guys in that i am a fan of zombie flicks			0
" @entity86 " may possibly be my favorite movie ever			0
i 'm also a fan of alien and robot movies , but more often than not , it seems women are more adept at dispatching those			1
@entity92 movies indulge male power - fulfillment fantasies			1
we enjoy pretending to be dragon - slaying knights or bad - guy - perforating cowboys or @entity97 , saving our ex-wife from a skyscraper full of terrorists			1
the @entity0 : compliments guys take as insults before any feminist blood vessels burst , let me explain that this fantasy goes hand - in - hand with a male - specific fear that speaks to ancient genetic programming			1
that for all our swagger , testosterone , and machismo , we can not protect those we love			2
the disaster call for women and children to evacuate first is n't chivalry , inasmuch as it 's evolutionarily smarts			2
the women and children will continue the species ; the men are disposable			2
we fear being useless , especially once we have issued forth our baby - making essence			2
the @entity0 : where all the good guys are in " @entity7 , " the vampire @entity125 has decided to change himself , to fight his ferocious nature			1
he struggles to be a better , um , corpse			0
he rejects the cold , bloodthirsty vampirism of his peers , and tries to embrace those human virtues he once had : selflessness , mercy , kindness , and justice			0
in some ways , he 's less a vampire and more a superhero			1
then he falls in love with someone he is told he should n't			2
and his love for @entity141 , a human woman , is a choice he has made , regardless of the scorn heaped upon him by the undead and the living alike			2
he protects her , despite his fears that he is completely impotent , powerless to defend her from a world that despises them both			0
and she returns the favor , despite her fears that underneath sweet words and passion is an animal waiting to pounce			0
a little bit for men and women			0
the @entity0 : ways men try to impress women i watch " @entity7 " because chicks will dig it when i can talk about @entity162 and @entity163 and @entity164 ; it 's how i " open " a pick - up artist - style " set			1
" my knowledge of " @entity7 " will help me convince turbo - hotties to come back to my sweet fourth - floor walk - up in @entity170 , where i will love them forever , or until i have to call the unemployment office at 10 a.m. , whichever comes first			1
i love this show , without condition			0
i love that @entity176 followed up his twee meditation on mortality , " @entity179 , " with a show that 's just about hot sexing and gratuitous gore			0
it 's a soft - core comic book , nothing more , nothing less			0
i fully accept that there 's a part of me that will always be a pear - shaped teenage goth girl			0
i mean , i 'm reading the " @entity7 " books , for the love of @entity191			0
horror movies , books , and television shows reflect our collective fears , and " @entity7 " is awesome because it sneaks male fears into a female - oriented program			1
also : because all the women are hot and sometimes they show their chest			0
