-- @entity1 has apologized for his decision to walk off the course at last week 's @entity5 tournament , and insists he will not repeat the mistake anytime soon			1
the world @entity7 left fellow professionals , fans and commentators in shock after leaving in the middle of his second round at the @entity15 in @entity16 , where he was defending his title			1
the @entity18 had two bogeys , a double bogey and a triple bogey before hitting his tee shot at the 18th into the water , having started at hole nine			1
that led him to walk away citing a sore wisdom tooth , although he now admits that his actions were wrong and regrettable			2
" i realized pretty quickly that it was n't the right thing to do , " @entity1 told reporters wednesday			1
" no matter how bad i was playing i should have stayed out there			2
" i was n't in a good place with my golf game			2
my head was all over the place			0
everybody makes mistakes -- most of my mistakes are in the public eye			0
i have learned from it and it wo n't happen again			0
" a year in sport is a long time and @entity1 's start to 2013 pales into insignificance compared to the form he was showing 12 months ago			1
following the signing of a 10 - year deal with @entity49 , which is reported to be worth $ 250 million , @entity1 has failed to recapture the magic which secured him the @entity51 and 2012 @entity53 titles			1
since changing from his @entity55 clubs to the @entity49 brand , he has failed to shine , missing the cut at @entity58 and exiting the @entity60 event in @entity61 at the first - round stage			1
with the masters in @entity64 on the horizon , @entity1 is aiming to rekindle the form which propelled him to the top of the @entity5 and @entity69 money lists last year			1
and he is now hoping to start his resurgence at the $ 8.75 million @entity71 at @entity72 -- beginning with his swing			0
" i know it 's purely the swing			1
no problem at all , " he said of his new equipment			1
" when i make a good swing it does exactly what i want			0
it does n't make a difference what clubs i play			0
" i 'm trying to change my swing but i 'm trying to change it back to where it was			0
i have been in that position before and i can get it back again			0
" there 's no quick fix in golf			2
you 've got to get to the root of the problem			0
it 's still a work in progress			2
" @entity1 also revealed that he is waiting before deciding whether to add an extra event to his schedule before the @entity63 begins on april 11			1
his only other scheduled tournament after @entity102 is the @entity103 from march 28 - 31			0
" i was waiting to see how i do this week , " he said			0
" right now i have n't made a decision			0
the likelihood is i wo n't add an event			1
i do n't think it 's likely			2

@entity1 apologizes for walking off at @entity15
world *no.* 1 will tee off at @entity112
@entity18 says he has no *concerns* over new @entity49 equipment
@entity1 unlikely to add an extra event to *calendar* ahead of april 's masters
