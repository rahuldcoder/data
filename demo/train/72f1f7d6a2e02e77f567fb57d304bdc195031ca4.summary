-- most of us have n't partied with the bunnies at " @entity4 , " or fought crime like " @entity6			0
" and with the @entity8 and @entity9 programs canceled after just a few episodes , we 'll never have the chance			1
but in the time it took for one alphabet network drama to get the axe , another garnered 8 million viewers and a full season pickup			1
after all , " revenge " is a language we all understand			2
the modern day " @entity21 " reels audiences in with characters viewers seem to love -- and love to hate			1
not to mention plot twists to die for			0
still , the primetime soap does n't venture into campy territory			0
not even while playing with traded identities and crimes of passion			0
the concept is simple : @entity32 , disguised as @entity32 , returns to the @entity33 to take revenge on the people who destroyed her family when she was a little girl			1
and " revenge " could n't have come at a better time as far as its network is concerned			2
with " @entity43 ' " eighth and final season underway , @entity9 was fortunate to find a new female - driven drama that so far appears to resonate with viewers			1
" revenge " even has its own insightful narrator			2
( thank you , @entity49			0
) " for the truly wronged , real satisfaction can only be found in one of two places : absolute forgiveness or mortal vindication , " narrator and protagonist @entity32 , played by former " @entity55 ' " cast member @entity54 , coos at the beginning of the pilot			1
before even making the acquaintance of her victims , she 's got the audience on her side			0
that 's not to say everyone is a fan of her narration			0
with " @entity43 " and " @entity70 " in mind , one @entity69 reviewer wrote , " @entity9 has an in - house style that says that having your female lead narrate nothingness at the start of every episode is a worthy strategy			1
" but whether you 're a fan of @entity32 's philosophical musings or not , the numbers do n't lie			1
about 7.3 million viewers tuned in to " @entity40 " on @entity83 -- better known as the biggest bar night of the year			2
now nine episodes in , the series began in a predictable fashion -- with @entity32 targeting and conquering one victim every week			1
each episode even ended with @entity32 marking a red x over the victim of the hour in a posed photograph of the @entity33 royalty			1
" @entity40 " has since taken a more complex turn , with the introduction of new characters , telling flashbacks and plans gone awry -- a change welcomed by some critics			2
" the show has wisely realized that it needs to mix it up when it comes to ' revenging , ' and it 's also fruitful to have plans backfire and have unexpected complications emerge , " @entity107 critic @entity106 wrote in her column , " stay tuned			0
" one complication being antagonist @entity109 , played brilliantly by @entity112			0
let 's just say @entity32 is n't the only character seeking revenge			1
the perfect present day villain , @entity116 is out to get her son 's new love interest , her daughter 's inept boy toy , her unfaithful husband and the frenemy who led him astray			1
" i can believe that this person would be doing these things , " @entity112 told the @entity125			0
" it 's easy for me to slide into her			0
" as if @entity112 and @entity133 were n't enough of a sell , the show 's portrayal of the @entity33 royalty might be			2
" we are dealing at a particular time right now in @entity137 history where i think the average @entity137 is going to want to see the takedown of the rich , " @entity112 said			0
nothing like a show about rich people who hate their lives to keep one entertained during a recession .			0
