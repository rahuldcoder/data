@entity0 -- @entity2 rolled out a high - definition ipad on wednesday with a faster processor , a better camera and a display screen that promises to be dramatically sharper than the current model , the ipad 2			1
" it is amazing , " @entity2 ceo @entity9 said at a @entity0 unveiling			2
" we 've taken it to a whole new level , and we are redefining the category that @entity2 created with the original @entity16			1
" the new 9.7 - inch display screen will feature a " retina display " of 2047 by 1536 pixels , compared with the current model 's 1024 by 768 pixels			1
to break it down , that 's a total of 3.1 million pixels on the display screen			2
" your retina in your eye can not discern those individual pixels , " said @entity2 senior vice president @entity24			1
" the images on it look stunning			0
" the new @entity16 will be available in the @entity31 and 9 other countries march 16 and cost the same as the ipad 2 -- from $ 499 to $ 829 based on storage capacity and @entity37 capacity			1
pre-orders were opened at @entity2 's online store on wednesday			2
the new version will be available in the @entity31 on @entity41 and @entity42 and will be the first @entity16 to connect to 4g networks ( a fact that , at least for now , remains academic in most cities )			1
it also will go on sale friday in @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 , @entity56 , the @entity57 and the @entity58			0
" this new @entity16 has the most wireless bands of any device that has ever shipped , and it is truly revolutionary , " @entity24 said			1
and the new @entity16 will be the first to run on 4g wireless networks , a source familiar with the device 's specifications told @entity1 on wednesday			2
it will have a a 5 - megapixel camera , representing a significant leap from the current @entity16 's so - so lens			1
surprisingly , " the new @entity16 " was as close to a name as @entity2 gave the gadget wednesday			1
predictions had bounced back and forth between " @entity16 " and " @entity16 " before the event			2
but the announcement ended without an official name being announced			0
whether that means @entity2 plans to abandon an @entity75 - like naming routine ( @entity75 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity75 4 , @entity79 ) in favor of occasional upgrades to " the @entity16 " remains to be seen			1
on wednesday , @entity9 also announced an updated version of @entity83 , the company 's web - tv integration device that competes with products like @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
the system supports 1080p , or " @entity93 " high - definition video , up from the current model 's 720p			1
it will be available for $ 99 starting next week and could pave the way for what 's expected to be @entity2 's next project : a fully integrated high - definition television			1
" across the year , you 're going to see a lot more of this kind of innovation , " @entity9 teased at the end of wednesday 's event			0
" we are just getting started			0
" when the @entity16 was introduced in early 2010 , tablets already existed , but none had become popular with mainstream consumers			2
some analysts wondered if there would be a market for a device that falls somewhere between a smartphone and a laptop but does n't fully replace either			0
the answer was a resounding " yes			0
" the company has sold more than 55 million @entity121 worldwide to date			0
before his death in october , @entity2 co-founder @entity122 predicted that 2011 would be the " year of the copycat " in the tablet space			2
in large part , it was , and that was bad news for @entity2 's rivals , as competitors from @entity132 to @entity133 to @entity134 tried unsuccessfully to offer a viable alternative to the @entity16			1
the new @entity16 will arrive in a somewhat trickier landscape			0
by going smaller and simpler , @entity137 made a splash with its @entity139 over the holidays , while rival bookseller @entity141 countered with its popular @entity142			0
both devices start at $ 199			0
the new @entity144 offers more memory than the @entity16 2 , while other companies have begun flooding the market with devices that are smaller and cheaper than @entity2 's standard - bearer			1
just last week , @entity150 rolled out its @entity152 operating system for tablets , suggesting that @entity155 - based tablets could be making a serious run			0
in a move perhaps designed as a shot at these rival upstarts , @entity9 announced wednesday that the price on the @entity161 will be slashed $ 100			0
so , a @entity162 , @entity37 - only model will sell for $ 399 , making it more competitive with the lower - end tablets			0
@entity2 surprised many observers last year when the @entity161 was priced the same as the original @entity16 : ranging from $ 499 to $ 829 , depending on @entity167 and storage capacity			1
@entity9 also announced wednesday that the 25 billionth app has been downloaded from the @entity170			0
perhaps significantly , that app was downloaded in @entity171 .			0

new : @entity2 unveils a high - definition @entity16
the device is the third version of its market - leading tablet
it will display *2047x1536* pixels , a huge leap
device goes on sale march 16 for same prices as @entity161
