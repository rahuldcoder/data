-- pope @entity1 on sunday called for an end to violence in @entity4 , as well as a renewed peace effort in the @entity6 , in his annual @entity8 message from the @entity9 as @entity10 worldwide marked the holiday			1
" may the risen @entity17 grant hope to the @entity6 and enable all the ethnic , cultural and religious groups in that region to work together to advance the common good and respect for human rights , " the pope said in his " @entity14 " ( " to the @entity15 and to @entity16 " ) message in @entity13			2
" particularly in @entity4 , may there be an end to bloodshed and an immediate commitment to the path of respect , dialogue and reconciliation , as called for by the international community , he said			2
" may the many refugees from that country who are in need of humanitarian assistance find the acceptance and solidarity capable of relieving their dreadful sufferings			0
" the @entity42 people , he said , should be encouraged to " spare no effort in pursuing the path of stability and development			0
in the @entity49 , may @entity47 and @entity48 courageously take up anew the peace process			2
" and the pope asked that " the risen @entity17 comfort the suffering populations of the @entity53 and favor their reconciliation , " including @entity55 and @entity56 , " and grant their inhabitants the power of forgiveness			0
in @entity61 , now experiencing delicate political developments , may the glorious @entity17 grant peace and stability			0
to @entity66 , which in recent times has experienced savage terrorist attacks , may the joy of @entity8 grant the strength needed to take up anew the building of a society which is peaceful and respectful of the religious freedom of all its citizens			1
" @entity10 have previously been the targets of violence in @entity66 , most notably on christmas day , when a string of bombs struck churches in several cities			1
a bombing sunday in the northern city of @entity84 killed 25 people and wounded another 13 , emergency management agency spokesman @entity81 said			0
while the blast was near a @entity88 where services were taking place , the target was not immediately clear			1
thankfully , thousands of @entity8 services -- from the annual sunrise service at @entity93 outside @entity94 , to throngs of worshipers attending @entity8 in the @entity97 -- were far more peaceful , a time for both reflection and celebration			2
in @entity100 , @entity101 , that included cheers for @entity103 , who has become known as much for his religious devotion as for his exploits on the football field			1
the quarterback took the stage alongside @entity110 senior pastor @entity109 to talk about how his faith brings him peace , joy , stability and a sense of purpose even at times of what might seem like intense turmoil and scrutiny			2
@entity103 has been on a roller coaster in the last year with his play and public displays of faith , and more recently with his trade from the @entity125 to the @entity126			1
" whatever happens in life -- good or bad , whether you 're the hero or the goat , whether you like it or not -- you know that someone has a plan for your life , and it 's a special plan , " @entity103 told the congregation , about his belief that his future is in @entity131 's hands			1
" when you trust that and you have hope in that , then you have peace in all decisions and everything you do			0
and it brings a lot of joy to your life			0
" for @entity10 in countries thrown into tumult by the @entity154 revolutions , some say @entity8 celebrations could prove dangerous			1
in the past , @entity4 @entity10 " have had great outpouring of piety in the public squares on @entity8 , " said @entity156 , director of the @entity157 at the @entity158 in @entity94			1
" this time , i suspect it is going to be vastly different			0
" though the geopolitical makeup of each @entity154 country is different , @entity156 and other religious freedom scholars say that a pious holiday like @entity8 presents an opportunity for @entity170 groups to seek out worshippers			2
religious holidays have long been a venue for terrorist attacks against all religious groups in the @entity6 and @entity176			0
these holidays provide not only a meaningful day to make a statement but also see large concentrations of worshippers in one area			0
" @entity17 is hope and comfort in a particular way for those @entity88 communities suffering most for their faith on account of discrimination and persecution , " the pope said sunday			1
" and he is present as a force of hope through his church , which is close to all human situations of suffering and injustice			0
" last @entity8 , @entity1 called for peace amid ongoing conflicts in @entity176 and the @entity6 and mentioned the plight of those in @entity199 recovering from the devastating earthquake and tsunami			1
@entity0 's @entity202 and journalist @entity203 contributed to this report .			0
