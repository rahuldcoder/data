-- so you got a flu vaccine this season , and you 've been reading about the flu epidemic			1
you might be wondering : will the vaccine keep me healthy ? the answer : the vaccine is n't a guarantee that you 'll be flu - free			1
in fact , it 's about 62 % effective , said the director of the @entity13 , dr. @entity14 , on friday			1
it can prevent the flu , and it can be beneficial even if you do get sick , said dr. @entity18 , chairman of the preventive medicine department at @entity21 's @entity20			1
" it 's the best vaccine we have , but there are cases of influenza that occur despite immunization , " @entity18 said on " @entity22 " thursday morning			1
the effectiveness of the vaccine depends , in part , on how well it matches the strains of viruses that actually end up prevailing during the flu season			1
so far , according to the @entity13 , this year 's @entity36 vaccine matches well with the most predominant type of flu spreading in the @entity39 , but is less well matched to the no. 2 type of virus			1
this year 's @entity36 vaccine is made from three viruses : two types of influenza a virus ( @entity45 and @entity46 ) and an influenza b virus			0
as of january 5 , the @entity13 said friday , the predominant virus in the @entity39 was an influenza a ( @entity45 ) virus that matched well with the @entity45 virus represented in the vaccine			1
of the @entity45 viruses tested at that point , 99.4 % matched the type that the vaccine protects against			2
the match for influenza b viruses , the second-most common this season , was n't as good			1
of the influenza b viruses tested between october 1 and january 5 , 66.7 % were the type represented in the vaccine			2
the match for @entity46 , much rarer this season , was 100 % , the @entity13 said			1
of the viruses collected and tested in the @entity39 in early january , 20.2 % were influenza b and the rest were influenza a -- the vast majority of which appeared to be of the @entity73 variety , according to the @entity13			2
the vaccine generally works better " in young , healthy people than it does in older persons , " @entity18 said			1
the @entity13 concurs : even when vaccinated , some older people and people with certain chronic illnesses might not develop the same high levels of immunity as healthy , young adults , the @entity13 says on its website			2
what to do if you have the flu but even if it does n't prevent illness in a particular person , the vaccine still can mitigate some of the symptoms			1
" ( flu vaccines ) are often of benefit because they can prevent some of the complications			0
it makes a more serious infection somewhat milder , " @entity18 said			0
keep in mind that the vaccine does n't work right away			0
" it takes about two weeks after vaccination for antibodies to develop in the body and provide protection against the flu , " the @entity13 's website says			2
opinion : in the future , get vaccinated earlier it 's not too late to get a flu shot , @entity18 said			2
" @entity111 is going to be with us into february and even beyond			0
if you have n't been vaccinated , please , take advantage of the benefits of influenza vaccine , " he said			0
" run , do not walk -- get the vaccine			0
protect yourself and everyone around you			0
" @entity122 : it 's an epidemic if you did get the vaccine but still came down with the flu , you might wonder if the vaccine caused the illness			2
it did not , @entity18 said			0
" you can get a bit of a sore arm if you get the injection			0
if you get the nasal spray variety , you can have a sore throat for a day and a runny nose			0
but you ca n't get flu from the flu vaccine , " he said			1
dr. @entity139 , @entity0 chief medical correspondent , endorsed getting a flu vaccine and frequently washing your hands			1
" with soap and water , wash your hands for two ' @entity147 ' songs , " he advised in an interview on @entity0 's " @entity143			0
" if you have the flu , how are you treating it ? send photos of your flu survival kits			0
@entity0 's @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this report .			0

new : vaccine is about 62 % effective , @entity13 director says
getting the flu vaccine is n't a guarantee that you 'll be healthy
the most common flu strain this season is a match with the vaccine
but even if it does n't stop illness , it can stop some symptoms , dr. @entity18 says
