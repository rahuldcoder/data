-- last week 's tornado outbreak was the largest in @entity3 history , according to the @entity4			1
at least 178 tornadoes tore across communities in 14 states and caused 327 deaths			2
among the communities affected by the storms was @entity11 , a small town in northwest @entity13			1
half of the town 's businesses were damaged , and many homes were reduced to rubble			1
@entity11 , population 2,800 , had limited resources to deal with the emergency until 2008 @entity22 @entity21 and his @entity23 rolled into town			1
with more than $ 1 million worth of specialized equipment , @entity26 's mobile response team has the tools and the experience to help communities recover in their darkest hours			1
@entity0 spoke to @entity21 about his group 's recent efforts in @entity11			1
@entity0 : where were you when you heard about the storms , and why did you decide to come to @entity11 ? @entity21 : ( we ) had been in @entity37 for the past two weeks			1
we responded to a terrible tornado there that ripped through most of the state			1
all of a sudden , we 're watching on tv one of the worst ( tornado outbreaks ) form in @entity3 history , possibly			1
we knew there was going to be a tremendous amount of suffering , and we knew we had to respond			2
we decided to come to @entity11 , @entity13 , because it 's a small community , and most likely they did n't have resources they would need to deal with this type of storm			1
@entity0 : what kind of resources do you bring with you ? @entity26 : when a disaster strikes , you do n't really know what you 're going to need , so you have to bring everything			1
that 's why we 've packaged up four tractor - trailers loaded with just about every type of tool and gear and piece of equipment			1
we have huge lighting systems and rubble cameras for search and rescue			2
we 've got cranes and trucks to remove the debris from the road			2
we 've got the ( generators ) to power up emergency rooms , nursing homes , shelters			2
we 've got just about every type of cutting tool known to mankind -- plasmas cutters , concrete saws , metal saws , wood saws -- anything that you need to get through an area to get to the people that need help			1
we have seen just about every type and size of disaster imaginable			1
we can create a lot of progress really quickly in a lot of communities just by the experience we have and the equipment we have			1
@entity0 : what have you been doing since you arrived in @entity11 ? @entity26 : we were able to get the church powered up and utilize it as a shelter			2
after that , we quickly moved in gear to start clearing roadways			2
clearing roads is really important , because people ca n't get out if the roads are n't cleared			2
ambulances and fire trucks need to get to home sites to perform search and rescue , so we help with that			2
this debris is really tricky stuff to deal with			0
when you look at a road and it 's covered with houses and trees and cars -- just about anything you can imagine -- it 's a little challenging to figure out how to clear that path			0
but we 've got the equipment to be able to do that			1
so we just began to clear one road after the other			0
@entity0 : you 've also been clearing home sites			0
how do you decide who to help ? @entity26 : it was a little difficult to figure out where to start			0
it 's just home after home , hundreds of them for miles and miles throughout this county and city			0
and so we decided to start helping families who lost loved ones in the storm			1
i literally just started walking up the streets			0
" do you know anybody that 's in need ? do you know any families that have lost loved ones ? " and the local community led me to @entity157 ( @entity156 , whose father was killed )			0
not only were we able to go through the home site ( where @entity156 's father lived ) and find some of their precious belongings and clear the site , but we were also able to prepare the burial grounds for her and her family			0
@entity0 : this work is so physically and emotionally grueling			0
what keeps you going ? @entity26 : this is part of being human			0
a lot of people think the government is supposed to help us or @entity178 's supposed to help us , the @entity172 in @entity173 will help us			0
but when we see people who are really suffering and struggling , it 's our responsibility to come and to help			0
i 'll come into a city , and i 'll meet absolute strangers			0
and within days , they 're kind of like friends and family			0
and it 's hard when you look into their faces and you see the sadness and the loss , the shock and confusion			0
and all i can hope is that what we did makes a difference in their lives ... and hopefully others will also rise to the occasion , see the needs and do something about it			0
