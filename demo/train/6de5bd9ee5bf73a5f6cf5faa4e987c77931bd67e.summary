-- an awful lot of companies have tried to figure out how to make consumers want to stream internet video in the living room			0
one of the few to have succeeded is @entity7 , whose cheap little boxes offer easy access to 1,200 channels of content , from biggies such as @entity13 , @entity14 and @entity15 to stuff you never knew existed			1
the company has sold 8 million boxes , which have been used to watch 1.7 billion hours of video to date			0
at this year 's ces show in @entity22 , @entity7 's big news is that it 's going to be possible to watch those 1,200 channels without even paying for and hooking up that cheap little box			1
it 's going to work with tv companies to build @entity27			1
@entity7 will design the entire interface , as well as the super-simple remote control ; essentially , it 'll be as if a @entity7 box sprouted a gigantic screen			1
( this is , by the way , @entity7 's second pass at partnering up with tv builders : the first is the @entity38 , a tiny doohickey designed to be bundled with @entity27			2
) the first two tv makers @entity7 is working with are two @entity41 companies : @entity42 and @entity43			2
considering their low profiles in the @entity47 , that does n't sound like a big whoop , but the two @entity41 manufacturers are the third and fifth largest tv producers globally , according to @entity7			1
and both see built - in @entity7 as a way to raise their profile in the @entity47 market			2
@entity54 , @entity7 's founder and ceo , told me that @entity42 and @entity57 are just the start			0
designing internet tv software and services and signing up content partners is such a major undertaking that he sees @entity63 as an appealing proposition for every tv producer except @entity66			0
" our goal is to be the platform for tv , " he says			0
these first two companies plan to ship @entity27 in a variety of sizes from 32 inches to 55 inches this fall			1
pricing will be announced later , but " we think that smart tv features should be in every tv for essentially the same price , " @entity54 told me			0
" i 'm sure there will be some small premium at the beginning			0

@entity7 will work with tv manufacturers to build @entity7 tv sets
