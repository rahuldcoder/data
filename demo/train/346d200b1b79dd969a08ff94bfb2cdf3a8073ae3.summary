@entity0 is big currency in @entity2 , a nation obsessed with love , romance and dating			1
in fact , the @entity2 are so committed to the day they celebrate it twice			1
there 's qixi , @entity2 's equivalent to @entity0 , which takes place in august , as well as the global version coming up on saturday			1
both are embraced with gusto by couples across the country			0
in the spirit of the season , we 've put together a tongue - in - cheek guide to getting a date in @entity2 that also aims to shed a little light on the pursuit of love in the @entity26			1
1 ) head to a park			2
they 're a real - life @entity30 every weekend in @entity2 a strange , albeit charming , ritual takes place -- the parents of @entity2 's singles frequent their local park in order to match make on behalf of their children			1
they bedeck the park 's trees with their offspring 's college photos and sheets of paper listing their key dating characteristics			2
why not visit your local stretch of green this saturday then ? it 's the perfect way to kill two birds with one stone -- meet your future love and your future in - laws			0
2 ) if you 're from @entity55 , work it remember that 1990s film " @entity60 " starring @entity58 and @entity59 ? it did raise one key dating point -- passports and permits matter			2
nowhere else is this more so than in @entity2 , where one of the top assets people look for in a lover ( after the oft - cited house and car ) is whether they have a permit to the city they wish to live in			1
the hukou , as it is known , is tied to a host of social benefits			0
with it , your life is easy			0
without it , not so much			0
if you happen to have a hukou that allows you to live in one of @entity2 's premier cities , be sure to let lots of singles around you know			1
3 ) parents are a useful resource			2
they might even join on a date the family remains the cornerstone of @entity2 life -- and love			1
therefore , it stands to reason that parents / siblings / aunts / uncles / pets are very involved in everyone 's dating destiny			1
when not found in a park trying to " pimp " people out , they will be gossiping with neighbors , friends and co-workers about said person 's single status and how to change it			2
you can fight this centuries - old tradition or you can embrace it			0
the major catch ? they might join you on a date			0
it 's not uncommon for relatives to chaperone their children on romantic soirees in @entity2			1
4 ) if you 're a single female , head to the countryside ! you 've probably heard that @entity2 has more men than women ( 118 boys to 100 girls , to be precise )			1
then there 's the common clich√© that @entity2 women " marry up " and @entity2 men " marry down			1
" the result is that supposedly " second - rate " men are being left out of the dating world altogether			2
these guang gun ( bare branches ) , as they have kindly been named , typically reside in the countryside			2
alpha males , by contrast , make their way to the city			0
the silver lining ( if you 're female , that is ) ? there are now entire villages full of @entity144 waiting for their juliets			0
5 ) if you 're a single man , head to the cities ! following on from the above point , @entity2 's alpha females reputedly struggle in love			1
if they 're single and over 27 , they 're derided as sheng nu -- leftover			0
if they have a phd , they 're not even regarded as a true woman			0
instead , they go by the putdown " third gender			0
" if you see through these labels and the propaganda surrounding them , you 'll appreciate that @entity2 's cities are full of some of the most savvy , intelligent and interesting women on the planet			1
6 ) go online ! by the end of 2014 , 649 million @entity2 were registered as online			2
plenty see the internet as love - line number one			0
@entity2 now has the largest number of online daters			2
the nation 's singles can peruse a buffet of sites , from those that promise to find you the one , to others that are more wired towards one - nighters ( although the trend is much more towards the former than the latter )			0
7 ) rent a boyfriend / girlfriend ! yep , you can do that online too the pressure to wed has become so extreme in @entity2 that an entire industry has sprung up around faux dating			1
take a tour of @entity193 , @entity2 's most popular online marketplace , and vying for your attention against countless cyber flower stalls and jewelry brands that emerge for @entity0 are the stores that offer something more unusual -- fake partners			1
for a price , your fake boyfriend / girlfriend will accompany you back to your parents , to the cinema , to dinner , anywhere you want really			0
they 'll play the part in every way except going all the way			0
8 ) if you still feel unsure , call up a love guru do not despair -- there are now love gurus in @entity2 , who , taking their cue from @entity216 tv show " @entity217 , " will offer men advice on how to successfully chat up women			1
walk slightly in front and to the side of the person you wish to court -- that 's just one tip taught in these classes			0
other jewels include dressing better and spending less on the object of your affection ( yes , you read that correctly ) .			0

@entity2 are so committed to @entity0 , they celebrate it twice .
parks and parents play a big role in the @entity2 dating scene .
single men should head to the cities , women to the countryside .
