a short story , buried on the fourth page of the sports supplement : that 's how the @entity4 , one of @entity6 's most globally orientated of newspapers , marked what remains as @entity10 's most sensational result to date and possibly one of the greatest underdog victories of any @entity13			1
in front of 10,000 fans in @entity16 , a @entity18 team fielding three part - time players lined up for their second match of the 1950 @entity13 hosted by @entity21			1
it was a fixture that promised only humiliation for the 500 - 1 outsiders , as their opponents were the supremely confident , superstar - studded and much - lauded originators of the game : @entity29			1
interest in the match was limited back home			0
in fact , just one reporter from the world 's richest nation had made the trip , and only because he 'd paid his own way and used precious vacation time to attend			2
his newspaper , the @entity40 , had seen no value in covering the event			0
but @entity43 proved to be on the right side of history			0
for he was the only @entity18 journalist to file the epic tale of how a lone goal from @entity48 defeated the @entity49 and astonished the rest of the soccer - playing world			1
it was as if " @entity54 sent a baseball team ... and beat the @entity56 , " he famously wrote			0
in 2014 , if the @entity18 beat @entity58 on tuesday to once again upset the odds on @entity21 soil , it 's fair to say @entity62 's hacks will face stiffer competition for their words to be immortalized in the same vein			1
it seems soccer is starting to stir the soul of the @entity18 sports fan and , consequently , there are now hundreds relaying stories where there was once one			1
key indicators suggest interest in the sport stateside has reached a new zenith			0
the 2 - 2 draw @entity80 's men wrangled from @entity81 became the most - watched soccer game in @entity18 history according to @entity85 figures when it attracted 25 million television viewers			1
bearing in mind that baseball 's @entity88 averaged 15 million viewers on @entity91 while the @entity92 delivered a similar figure for @entity94 , college and @entity96 football now remain the only sports franchise with a greater magnetism for @entity18			1
for the tournament 's games in general there 's been a 50 % audience increase in the @entity18 from those of the @entity13 in @entity106 , 4.3 million against 2.8 million in 2010			1
this heightened profile means business has been brisk too			0
accountancy firm @entity109 recently predicted global sports revenues will be worth $ 145.3 billion by 2015 , driven on by events like the @entity13			2
@entity6 accounts for 45 % of this market and the 20 sponsors of @entity10 -- from @entity114 and @entity115 to @entity116 and @entity117 -- have hit the jackpot in @entity21			2
" as much as our own expectations were extremely high , those ( audience ) numbers surpassed even what we anticipated , " @entity119 , senior vice-president of global sponsorship for @entity121 , @entity123 's commercial arm that represents @entity10 , told @entity124			0
and it 's a sentiment shared by one of @entity6 's sport apparel giants too			0
@entity133 entered into football in 1994 and has seen its revenues in this area go from $ 40 million then to $ 2.3 billion for the last financial year			0
" we do n't give out numbers but sales for the two @entity18 soccer kits that we make have been very strong , " @entity137 , @entity133 's vp of @entity138 told @entity139			1
" the red , white and blue away kit was the best - selling @entity18 kit we 've ever done in @entity6 in the first two weeks after its launch			1
and even before the tournament had started , the level of interest was huge ... we posted a 21 % increase in our football product revenues for the year leading up to the @entity13 , and our @entity6 region was up 10 % in the fourth quarter helped by strong sales in soccer too			1
" the average sports fan in the @entity18 is getting into football during this @entity13 like never before			1
watching @entity161 's coverage in the @entity162 , with every game live and the action appearing in @entity165 , the fan fests in the major cities ... it shows this is no longer a minority sport but one that is on the up , " @entity137 added			2
" our animated ' last game ' advert has hit 200 million views online alone			0
the three films in our ' @entity173 ' campaign combined registered over 380 million online views ... i do n't have exact figures but these are two of the most shared brand videos in @entity180 's history			0
' @entity182 ' commercial had 75 million views online before it went on tv			0
" the digital realm is another area that is experiencing a surge of traffic from @entity6 's @entity13 interest			1
the last group game against @entity191 set a fresh online audience record when over 1.5 million people streamed the game via @entity195			2
this @entity13 has also seen a new high of 389,000 messages - per - minute recorded on @entity198 , eclipsing the previous mark set by activity around @entity201			1
@entity180 confirmed this year 's festival of football is the first event to generate 1 billion engagements -- posts , comments and likes -- on its platform with 220 million users ( 20 million more than the entire population of @entity21 ) interacting			1
during the @entity18 vs. @entity81 game alone , 10 million people generated 20 million @entity180 interactions			2
and it 's not just fandom in the digital sphere where @entity6 has been a force			0
supporters from the @entity162 were second only to host nation @entity21 in the amount of tickets ( 196,838 ) they bought for the tournament , with fan - group leaders confident this trend is only set to continue			1
" this has n't been an overnight sensation ; it 's been building and growing for 25 years			2
we 're excited to see our fan base grow and more and more people involved in the @entity13 , " @entity228 , @entity10 's senior manager of communication , told @entity139			2
" our number one goal is player development ; number two is growing the game and connecting with our fans			0
so we set up events ( at the @entity13 ) with our supporters where they can meet the players or on social ( platforms ) we provide a lot of information from behind the scenes , so they can feel part of the team at all times			2
" @entity10 work closely with unofficial supporters ' groups too , such as the " @entity250 " -- who organize travel packages for @entity13 ticket holders and parties on the ground			0
" in 2010 we had 25 official chapters ( groups across @entity6 ) and 10,000 members			0
currently we 're up to 143 chapters and 25,000 members ... and 7,000 members joined in the last two weeks , " @entity259 told @entity139			0
" only around 50 people came to @entity106 with us , it was basically one coach - load			0
this year we arranged travel packages and accommodation for 530 members ... despite the large distances that need to be covered in @entity21 , so it 's changing			2
" fandom is evolving in a uniquely @entity18 way too			0
" the great thing about being an @entity18 soccer fan is we can borrow some of the best aspects of other @entity18 sports ... so we tailgate before games for example , as well as take on the influence of @entity281 and @entity282 , " @entity259 said			2
" either way there is no better way to demonstrate your fandom than following your team to the ends of the earth , it 's just an amazing experience			0
" that 's if you can avoid the inevitable hangovers that accompany such an adventure , though @entity259 attests that the last - minute draw with @entity81 gave him a bigger headache than any ' " caipirinhas sunk in @entity21			1
" the plucky @entity18 outlaws that remain in @entity21 have trekked to @entity301 ahead of the showdown with @entity58 holding onto the belief that this nation can once again provide inspiration for their side to make history and reach the quarterfinals			1
@entity43 would no doubt be proud of the progress			0
