-- @entity2 's contention that in order for @entity5 to become a state @entity3 must be its principal language drew criticism thursday from the @entity10 territory 's sole representative in @entity11			1
" @entity2 's view is narrow and a limiting view of what @entity10 is all about , " said @entity13 , a @entity14 , on @entity0 's " @entity15			2
" " @entity3 is the predominant language in the @entity10 and will continue to be so , whether @entity5 becomes a state or not			1
" @entity5 will vote in november on a referendum regarding possible statehood			1
while campaigning wednesday ahead of the island 's primary on sunday , @entity2 told a newspaper that for @entity5 to become " a state of the @entity10 , @entity3 must be the principal language			1
" there is currently no law declaring an official language of the @entity10 , though several attempts have been made to give @entity3 that designation			2
thirty - one states have passed laws mandating @entity3 as their official language			0
the @entity35 also makes no mention of a language test for territories or properties that wish to become states			0
both @entity3 and @entity41 are official languages of @entity5 , though @entity41 is by far the dominant language on the island			1
@entity2 was spending a second day in @entity5 on thursday , courting voters ahead of the primary			1
asked about his comments on thursday , @entity2 told @entity0 , " @entity3 has to be learned as a language			2
it has to be a country where @entity3 is widely spoken and used			0
" asked if it should be a requirement for the territory to become a state , @entity2 said , " i think @entity3 and @entity41			1
obviously @entity41 will be spoken here on the island			0
but this needs to be a bilingual country , not just a @entity41 - speaking country			0
right now it is overwhelmingly @entity41 - speaking but it needs to have , in order for it to integrate into @entity10 society , @entity3 has to be a language that is spoken here also and spoken universally			0
" @entity63 is expected to win @entity5 's primary			1
he is scheduled to campaign on the island starting friday			0
@entity66 gov. @entity66 endorsed @entity63 in january			0
@entity63 's campaign issued a statement on thursday contrasting his position on the issue with @entity2 's			1
" @entity5 currently recognizes both @entity3 and @entity41 as the official languages of the commonwealth , " said @entity63 spokeswoman @entity71			1
" governor @entity63 believes that @entity3 is the language of opportunity and supports efforts to expand @entity3 proficiency in @entity5 and across @entity10			1
however , he would not , as a prerequisite for statehood , require that the people of @entity5 cease using @entity41			2
" the primary in @entity5 comes two days before a showdown in @entity83 , where polls show a tight race between @entity63 and @entity2			1
one of @entity2 's delegates withdrew his support for the former @entity89 senator over the language matter , according to a local report			2
the @entity93 newspaper reported that @entity94 said he is no longer committed to @entity2			0
the party chair told the paper that one of the alternate delegates submitted by @entity2 's campaign would fill the spot			1
@entity2 's campaign was re-energized after key primary victories in the @entity102 that raised questions about conservative rival @entity105 's viability as a candidate and portended a long battle with frontrunner @entity63			1
@entity63 , rejected again by @entity102 conservatives in the tuesday primaries in @entity111 and @entity112 , won caucuses in @entity114 and @entity115 to claim about a third of the total delegates available and maintain his delegate lead			0
however , @entity2 's twin primary triumphs -- while narrow -- reframed the @entity121 race as a one - on - one battle between the socially conservative former @entity89 senator and the more moderate @entity63 , with @entity125 's chances fading fast			1
@entity127 rep. @entity126 , the libertarian champion , continued to trail well behind the other three candidates in the campaign to face president @entity130 in november			2
" there is no end in sight , " noted @entity131 , a @entity0 contributor who was @entity134 press secretary under president @entity135			0
" ... for @entity121 who thought that maybe @entity63 could come @entity102 and make this race look like it was coming to an end , this race is going on and on and on			0
" delegate tracker : who 's got what the @entity112 and @entity111 victories give @entity2 wins in 10 states so far to @entity63 's 18 , and he poked at the frontrunner on wednesday as he reiterated his stance that he is the viable conservative alternative to the former @entity151 governor			1
" it 's pretty sad when all you have is to do math instead of trying to go out there and win it on substance and win it on what @entity10 want to hear about , " @entity2 told @entity0 in reference to @entity63 's claim of an insurmountable lead in delegates			1
" we 're a long , long way from over			0
" @entity63 , meanwhile , seemed to get the message from frustrated supporters who asked him to turn away from delegate math , stop arguing about electability and stop attacking @entity2 and instead focus on making a stronger case on why he deserves to be president			2
" look , i 'm perfectly pleased with the process we have , " @entity63 said thursday on @entity171 , acknowledging that his competitors are " tough " and " capable			0
" @entity83 and its 66 delegates once looked safe for @entity63 , but recent polls show it could go either way			2
after a stop in @entity179 , @entity2 has two events planned friday in @entity181 , @entity83			2
he 's also getting help in the form of a $ 310,000 purchase in @entity83 from the @entity185 -- a super pac that has been supportive of his candidacy			1
@entity63 is bringing in @entity189 gov. @entity188 to campaign for him in the state on friday			2
@entity188 , who 's popular with republicans across the country for his tough talk and tough actions in taking on @entity195 in @entity189 , disappointed many in his party last october when he announced he would not launch his own presidential bid			0
instead he endorsed @entity63 and has traveled to a number of primary and caucus states to stump for him , including @entity202			0
@entity125 , who based his campaign on a @entity102 strategy after winning @entity205 and @entity206 , appeared to be in major trouble after losing both @entity209 primaries tuesday			0
and he 'll be in the @entity102 again friday , as he 's scheduled to make several stops in @entity211			0
" the fact is that in both states , the conservative candidates got nearly 70 % of the vote , and if you 're the front - runner and you keep coming in third , you 're not much of a frontrunner , " @entity125 said of @entity63 's performance in @entity111 and @entity112			1
citing what he called @entity63 's vulnerabilities on health care reform , @entity125 said he does n't " believe that a @entity151 moderate who created @entity223 as the forerunner of @entity225 is going to be in a position to win any debates this fall , " and that is part of the reason he 's " insisted in staying in this race			1
" calls for @entity125 to drop out and unite conservative support for @entity2 have gotten louder since tuesday , but @entity125 argues that none of the candidates are likely to reach the 1,144 delegates necessary to clinch the nomination before may or june at the earliest , and probably not until the august convention			0
@entity2 and @entity63 are expected to split the next few contests on the calendar			2
after @entity5 and @entity83 , @entity2 is expected to win in @entity211 a week from saturday			1
then the race turns north and eastward -- the @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity245 vote on april 3 and @entity63 is the early favorite			0
but that 's three weeks away and much has changed in such a span in the most volatile @entity121 race in generations			0
@entity0 's @entity251 , @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 and @entity260 contributed to this report .			0
