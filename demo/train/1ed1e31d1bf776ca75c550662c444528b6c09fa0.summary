@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 no longer supports a power - sharing deal between @entity6 's president @entity5 and the country 's main opposition because a viable unity government is not possible with @entity5 in power , a top @entity3 diplomat said sunday			1
@entity6 president @entity5 , in a speech to supporters saturday , refused calls to step down			1
the statement from @entity3 assistant secretary of state for african affairs @entity16 follows recent calls from president @entity18 and other world leaders for @entity5 to abandon power amid a growing cholera epidemic that the @entity22 says has killed more than 1,000 people in recent months			1
@entity24 visited southern @entity1 to articulate the change in @entity3 policy toward @entity5 at the request of @entity3 secretary of state @entity28			2
she made the comments sunday during a roundtable discussion with journalists in @entity0 , @entity1 , before her expected return to the @entity3 later in the day			0
she called for a new vote in @entity6			0
" fresh elections are necessary but not possible under the current environment , " @entity24 told reporters			0
@entity6 has had no @entity38 since the march presidential election , during which no candidate won enough votes to avoid a runoff , according to the government			0
after opposition leader @entity44 withdrew from a june runoff , saying @entity5 's supporters had waged a campaign of violence against opposition supporters , @entity44 and @entity5 reached a power - sharing agreement that has yet to be implemented			1
the political impasse has aggravated the country 's humanitarian and economic crisis , including a cholera outbreak that began in august			1
@entity24 said that during her trip , she consulted with the leaders of @entity6 's neighbors who are stuck between their concerns about @entity5 's grip on power and their support of the power - sharing agreement , which they still think is the best way to deal with the crisis without creating a backlash			1
@entity24 said she believes it could be weeks before @entity1 leaders put pressure on @entity5 to step down , which she said could be achieved by simply telling him with one voice that he should go			0
she said the @entity72 will deal with the issue of @entity6 next month			0
this time , she said , @entity1 will not be able to block resolutions calling for more sanctions because @entity1 will no longer hold a seat on the council in 2009			0
watch what options the international community has in @entity6 " the @entity1 government will be held responsible for what is happening in @entity6 because they are the country with the most influence in @entity6 than any other in the world , " @entity24 said			0
the @entity72 's recent failure to impose sanctions on @entity5 's regime drew scoffs from the 84 - year - old @entity5 , who has accused @entity90 -- @entity6 's former colonizer -- of trying to take over the country to get its resources			2
@entity44 said friday that his party will withdraw from efforts to form a unity government unless 42 party members who have been kidnapped are either released or brought to court to face formal charges by @entity100			0
@entity5 's @entity94 and the @entity101 , led by @entity44 , have failed to implement the september 15 power - sharing deal because they can not agree on who should control key ministries			1
under the deal , brokered by former @entity1 president @entity106 , @entity5 would remain president while @entity44 would become @entity6 's prime minister			1
there had been hope that a unity government would reverse @entity5 's policies , which are widely blamed for the country 's economic crisis			1
@entity5 blames economic sanctions imposed by @entity117 nations for @entity6 's economic collapse			2
@entity6 , once the breadbasket of @entity1 , is now a net importer of food and facing acute shortages of most essentials such as fuel , electricity and medical drugs			0
its inflation rate -- the highest in the world -- is officially at 231 million percent			0
last week , @entity6 's central bank introduced a $ 10 billion note worth less than 20 @entity3 dollars			2
@entity5 has repeatedly refused calls from @entity117 leaders to step down , most recently telling his supporters late saturday that he would not follow the @entity3 president to his " political death			1
" " they now want to topple the @entity5 government			0
@entity5 must go because @entity18 is going , " he said in his address saturday to his party 's 10th annual conference outside @entity6 's capital , @entity142			2
" @entity6 will refuse that one of their sons must accompany @entity18 to his political death , " @entity5 said			2
" is it a ritual now that @entity18 with his political death must be accompanied by some @entity1 from @entity6 , and that @entity1 must be the leader himself , and that leader is @entity5 ? " @entity5 did not mention the cholera epidemic , which his government has said is under control despite the @entity22 ' assessment that half the country 's population may be at risk			1
there are more than 20,000 suspected cases of the water - borne disease in @entity6 , and the @entity22 said it fears that number will triple by the time the rainy season ends in april			0
in addition to @entity18 , the leaders of @entity90 , @entity162 and several @entity1 countries have called on @entity5 to abandon power and let a national unity government take over to help prevent the cholera epidemic from spilling across @entity6 's borders .			1
