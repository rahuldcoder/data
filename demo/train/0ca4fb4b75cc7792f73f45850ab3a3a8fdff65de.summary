-- can you remember what you were doing 30 years ago ? in 1983 , @entity3 retired from a glittering tennis career , the @entity6 @entity5 was officially charged with war crimes and the final episode of @entity9 was breaking tv records			1
more importantly , for the purpose of this exercise , millions of black and " non-white " @entity11 were living -- and dying -- in misery under a brutal apartheid regime			1
whatever you were doing back then , i would think it unlikely that any single decision you made has shaped what has become of your life since			1
that 's not the case , however , for the young black cricketers that left the @entity26 to play in @entity11			1
for them , everything changed the day they boarded a plane for @entity31			0
they are the focus of @entity0 's documentary " @entity35 : branded a rebel			1
" in 1977 , the @entity38 nations added a sporting ban to their campaign against apartheid in @entity11			1
by isolating the country 's teams and starving passionate and influential @entity11 of their beloved sport , it was hoped their government would be forced into changing policies that discriminated against a majority of the population			1
as a result , cricket 's " @entity55 " were highly controversial , unofficial , international matches that were organized in defiance of those sanctions			1
it was an issue that split the world 's cricket community right down the middle			1
the invited players that declined , such as @entity64 's @entity63 and @entity66 @entity65 , took a strong moral stance in opposition			2
contact ' branded as a rebel ' presenter @entity69 on @entity71 but , whether from @entity64 , @entity72 or @entity73 , the massive financial inducements were often too much even for some of the sport 's biggest names to refuse			2
for each of the seven tours , there was outcry , but it was the @entity83 ' role that provoked the most outrage			1
these men did n't steal anything -- they certainly did n't kill anyone -- and they did n't break any laws , but their " crime " was almost worse			0
they were condemned for supporting an abhorrent , racist regime ; effectively betraying their own race			0
ironically , it was they who were isolated			0
they were banished from playing international sport and shunned by their peers and communities ; many were forced to relocate abroad			0
only one ever played for the @entity83 again			1
hardly anything has been written or broadcast about their two tours between 1982 - 84 , a period which has been described as one of the darkest chapters in the history of cricket			1
whatever views have been articulated are typically negative , damning and highly critical of the players and those who funded and organized the matches			2
the common narrative is that they were mercenaries , traitors and rebels			2
but while the players ca n't deny that many were influenced by the money -- some were paid in excess of $ 100,000 for a month of cricket -- some would prefer to be known as missionaries			1
i knew it would n't be easy getting them to talk about their experience , just tracking them down was hard enough			0
for obvious reasons the @entity132 , which had banned them , was n't much use			0
some of the players like @entity137 and @entity138 -- known to have struggled with substance abuse -- have effectively fallen off the grid			2
trying to forget of those we tracked down , it soon became clear very few had any interest in reliving the experience			0
it was n't the tours that they did n't want to revisit , but the judgment and condemnation they had endured since			2
some players flatly declined , others wanted to be paid outrageous sums ; @entity0 's policy is not to pay for interviews			2
over a period of several weeks , myself and our producer @entity158 had a series of exhaustive exchanges with the team 's captain @entity163 , a talented batsman who was forced to leave @entity165 and settle in @entity166			2
we really thought he was close to giving an interview but ultimately he declined			0
i know he desperately wanted to tell his side of the story , a side which has never been heard before , but he was concerned his involvement would only reignite the controversy			0
he just could n't take the risk			0
i would say that the players who did speak with us had mixed reasons for giving their interviews			2
@entity179 is known as the greatest player never to have played for the @entity83 , but he is proud of his involvement			1
he still treasures his tour blazer and the team photo sits proudly on his shelf			2
he genuinely believes that the tours helped to change attitudes in @entity11 , claiming that for the first time in their lives , white fans were able to see that the black race was at the very least equal , if not superior , to theirs			1
of all the rebel teams , the @entity83 were the only one to win a test match in @entity11			1
@entity66 society 's ' running wound ' @entity194 , a hero of the @entity83 ' 1979 @entity196 final victory , felt the same			1
he was still angry at his treatment and we did n't have to scratch too far beneath the surface to find the bitterness still simmering			0
i believe that both men and the former wicketkeeper @entity203 talked to us because they did n't have anything else to lose -- whatever the tour had once cost them , being associated with it could no longer hurt them			0
that 's not the case for the likes of @entity210			0
even if he had wanted to share his story with us and a global audience , he has been " rehabilitated " as the current coach of the @entity217 national team			0
that status could have been jeopardized by reminding everyone he was once a " rebel			0
" as the regional historian professor @entity222 put it , the rebel tours still represent a " running wound " in @entity66 society			0
@entity179 , @entity194 and @entity203 all told me they had no regrets			0
@entity194 was very clear that he would never say sorry for going to @entity11			1
others have apologized , in the hope the controversy would be laid to rest			0
it will be interesting to see the reaction to our program ; whether hearing a different perspective will change perceptions of the fateful decision these players made 30 years ago			1
and it makes you wonder , if you were ever put in their position , what would you do ?			0

thirty years ago , a @entity83 cricket team took part in *unauthorized* tours
sporting sanctions had been placed on apartheid - era @entity11
the players who took part in the tours were branded as rebels , ending their careers
some remain defiant about their decision , but few have profited from it
