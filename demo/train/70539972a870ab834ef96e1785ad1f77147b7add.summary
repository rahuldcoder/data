-- of all the inhumane conditions in the detention of immigrants , the most serious is simply the condition of being locked up			1
detention means that parents are taken from their children and shipped hundreds of miles away to jails where visits are impossible			1
immigrants who have lived in the @entity11 for nearly their whole lives lose their jobs , their homes , and their livelihoods while locked up in @entity16 jails , trying to fight deportation to a country they do n't even remember , often without even a lawyer to help guide them through the complicated morass of immigration law			1
that is why it was good news to learn that hundreds of immigrants returned home to their communities and families after being released by @entity16 from detention centers across the country last week in anticipation of the federal budget cuts this action is moving us , as a nation , in the right direction			1
locking up thousands of immigrants is not critical for the agency to fulfill its enforcement mission			2
and now , we 've been given an opportunity to consider better alternatives			2
the impact of this decision was far more than fiscal savings : it brought loved ones home to their families , returned breadwinners to their communities , and released asylum seekers from confinement that exacerbated their past trauma			0
having worked as a lawyer for eight years with thousands of immigrants detained in the @entity60 desert , i have seen the devastating , and ultimately ineffective , results of our rapidly expanding detention system			1
our office regularly received desperate phone calls from wives , mostly @entity11 citizens , whose husbands were in detention			2
often the husbands were the sole breadwinners			0
the women and their children faced eviction from their homes because they could not keep up mortgage payments			0
they were forced to go on welfare , and their children 's school performance suffered			0
among my clients were asylum seekers who fled persecution and torture in their countries , only to find themselves locked up behind barbed wire for months and even years as they sought protection in @entity11			0
since 2003 , more than 2.4 million people have passed through immigration detention facilities in a network of over 250 jails and prisons			1
at an average cost of $ 164 per day per person , @entity16 spent more than $ 1.7 billion in 2011 to detain a record 429,000 immigrants			0
much of this money goes to private prison corporations that have contracts to house nearly half of the immigrants in @entity16 custody every day and are looking to grow their business -- having spent millions of dollars during the past 10 years on campaign donations and lobbyists at the state and federal level			1
immigrants in detention include lawful permanent residents with deep family and community ties , undocumented immigrants who have lived in the @entity11 for decades as part of mixed status families , survivors of torture , asylum seekers , pregnant women , military veterans , and the infirm			1
no matter their background , they are confined behind bars for months and sometimes years as they await a hearing to determine whether they can remain in the @entity11 legally			0
conditions in detention are punitive and inhumane			2
a recent set of reports compiled by @entity127 members highlighted conditions in 10 jails where immigrants are held that exemplify the egregious problems inherent throughout the immigration detention system			1
we found immigrants in detention wait weeks or months for medical care ; have inadequate , and in some cases absolutely no , outdoor recreation time or access to sunlight or fresh air ; are offered inadequate and nutritionally lacking food ; and are subjected to the use of solitary confinement as punishment , as outlined in a report by the @entity147 and @entity148			2
their families suffer extraordinary difficulties trying to visit their imprisoned relatives			0
in some facilities , families drive hundreds of miles to visit their loved ones , only to be forced to " visit " with them via video link in a separate building -- not because they pose a risk , but because the facility does not want to incur additional costs for in - person visits			2
the remote location of many facilities also interferes dangerously with people 's ability to get legal help to fight their cases			0
they often have no access to a lawyer			0
in the words of one immigrant detained at @entity176 in @entity177 , " we are like dogs , we ca n't see the sun or the sky			0
actually , even a dog gets to go outside			0
" since 2003 , at least 131 men and women died while in custody in these centers , which include private jails , county cells and federal centers , according to @entity16 reports			1
it does not have to be this way			0
alternatives to detention -- such as community - based programs that offer legal and social service support -- are effective and significantly cheaper , with some programs costing as little as $ 14 per day			1
these alternatives to detention yield about a 93 % appearance rate before the immigration courts and allow people to remain with their families and communities			1
given what we know about this hidden and punitive system , it is heartening to hear from members around the country that immigrants are being released from some of the worst facilities outlined in the reports			0
@entity16 should expand on this recent action by releasing everyone not subject to mandatory detention , and using alternative programs for those that are			1
the government 's action must also be a part of a larger initiative to reform our immigration detention system			0
one critical step is the congressional repeal of mandatory detention laws that have been responsible for tripling the number of people in detention			1
under these laws , up to 70 % of immigrants in detention are required to be imprisoned , without any individual assessment of their risk to public safety , while the government tries to prove that it has the authority to deport them			2
this practice is contrary to our practice in the criminal justice system and wholly un-american			0
until @entity246 acts , the @entity245 administration must renew its commitment to urgent reform of the detention system by closing the most egregious detention facilities , aggressively working with nongovernmental organizations to promote community - based supervision programs for those in proceedings , and pushing for legal regulation and third party oversight of the remaining detention centers			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 .			2

@entity261 : release of hundreds of immigrants from detention centers is good step
parents are taken from children , she says , sent far away to jails with *appalling* conditions
black : ever - growing detention centers run by private businesses with lobbyists
release people not subject to mandatory detention , she says , use alternatives
