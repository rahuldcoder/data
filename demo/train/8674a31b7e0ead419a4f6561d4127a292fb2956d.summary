it 's a long road to recovery for @entity4 nurse 's assistant @entity2			1
discharged from hospital six weeks ago after beating @entity6 , she faces life without her beloved dog , @entity9 , put down by @entity4 authorities for fear he might harbor the deadly virus			1
and questions remain about how she contracted the virus while helping to care for @entity4 missionaries brought back from @entity16 with @entity6 , and the way her own case was handled			1
@entity19 was in court thursday to seek 150,000 euros in damages from the then - @entity23 health minister she accuses of blaming her for catching the disease			1
he publicly apologized for the comments and later resigned			0
she is also taking legal action against regional health authorities over the death of @entity9			1
speaking to @entity31 from @entity23 , in her only global tv interview since leaving hospital , @entity19 became tearful as she recounted how she learned her adored dog had been put down			1
" due to my serious illness , no one was telling me what was happening in the outside world , " she said			0
unbeknownst to her , locked away in a hospital isolation room , animal rights activists had campaigned to prevent the dog 's euthanasia , with an online petition gathering more than 400,000 signatures			1
can pets get or spread @entity6 ? finally , on the day @entity19 received a negative blood test for @entity6 , her husband @entity47 broke the news in a phone call to her room			1
" my husband decided to wait in order to tell me about it and to me it was a very sad piece of news , totally unexpected			0
i have n't got words to talk about it , " she said , her emotion obvious			0
it was probably better not to tell her while she was ill , she said , but the loss still affects her today			2
" i 've forgotten about everything except the death of @entity9 -- not the death itself , but the way in which this was done without finding out first whether the dog was infected , " she said			2
" i think it would 've been much wiser to put the dog in quarantine and keep an eye on it , rather than to sacrifice the dog like that			2
" this was what happened in the case of @entity77 nurse @entity76 , whose dog @entity78 was quarantined while she was treated for @entity6			1
after testing negative for the virus , the pet was eventually returned , tail wagging , to its grateful owner			0
romero : experience was surreal it was " easier " for the @entity23 authorities to have her dog put down , @entity19 said , but it made what was already a traumatic situation for her far harder			1
and she still asks herself why it had to be that way			0
" it 's a lack of sensitivity , a lack of human feelings , it 's really nasty , nasty			2
everything has been this way , but we forget about everything except the death of my dog			2
" the " everything " @entity19 refers to relates to the way her infection with @entity6 was first diagnosed and then handled			1
after she was taken to the @entity106 in @entity23 by ambulance , suffering symptoms including vomiting and a rash , she underwent a battery tests			1
but such was the apparent state of confusion , she said , that she found out she 'd been confirmed as having @entity6 not from medical staff -- but by seeing the news story on her cell phone			1
" it is surreal , nobody tells you anything and they come and put you inside a bubble and they take you away			0
and they did n't tell you anything			0
" she said she later found out that the emergency room doctor who first treated her was not informed about her two positive blood tests either			0
" surprising as it is , this is how it happened , " she said			0
" no doctor told me about it , nobody told me anything about it , nothing			0
i think that they were going crazy			0
this took us all aback			0
" @entity31 is seeking comment from the @entity142 over @entity19 's allegation that news that she had tested positive for @entity6 was given to the press before she found out			1
it 's still not clear how this leak transpired			2
' you think about it ' meanwhile , @entity23 's superior court has already ruled once on the case of @entity9 -- saying that regional health officials did not act recklessly in putting him down			1
but @entity19 's legal team is planning to take them to court again , seeking 150,000 euros compensation for his death			1
she also wants to see a change in the official protocols for caring for suspected @entity6 cases so others do n't undergo the same ordeal			1
this could include recording the medical staff as they work so any errors in taking off the protective gear could be spotted and lessons learned , according to @entity19			2
she says she still does not know how she herself contracted the virus -- and likely never will			0
" i followed the protocols			2
i did everything that needs to be done , " she said			0
" what you are doing is something so serious , you are risking your life every time you walk into a room -- so you think about it			0
" last month , the hospital 's director general dr. @entity182 , said that through @entity19 's case , the hospital had learned many lessons about the treatment of @entity6 patients and how to protect staff caring for them			1
@entity19 said she was not yet completely physically recovered from the virus -- which has killed more than 6,000 people in @entity16 -- but was slowly getting better			2
meanwhile , her anger and grief over @entity9 's fate continues to burn strongly			0
" if i had known about the killing of the dog , i would never have volunteered " to care for the @entity4 missionaries , she said .			0

@entity2 is suing @entity23 regional authorities for putting down her dog
she is also suing the *ex-regional* health minister , who she says blamed her for falling ill
" it 's clear they were not ready to look after a possible case of @entity6 , " she says of hospital
@entity19 wants to see revised protocols for health workers caring for @entity6 patients
