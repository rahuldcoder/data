-- it 's known as the @entity2 , but @entity2 has taken a dizzying step toward being the @entity4 after the @entity5 unveiled a new glass floor			1
offering dramatic views of the 57 - meter ( 187 - foot ) drop from the 125 - year - old landmark 's first level , the transparent walkway has proved a hit with visitors lining up -- and lying down -- to take selfies			1
