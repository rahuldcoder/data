@entity0 , @entity1 -- billionaire @entity3 has been thinking about the inequities in the @entity6 tax system at least since june 2007			1
i know this because , during @entity11 ' @entity10 presidential debate in which i served on a panel of journalists , i asked the eight democrats , including @entity15 , what they thought of comments @entity3 had made about the unfairness of a tax system where his secretary paid a higher percentage of her income in taxes than he did			1
i asked @entity15 if he agreed with @entity3 that the rich were n't paying their fair share , and what he would do about it			1
" there 's no doubt that the tax system has been skewed , " @entity15 answered			1
" but i think this goes to a broader question , and that is , are we willing to make the investments in genuine equal opportunity in this country ? " people are n't looking for charity , and one of the distressing things sometimes when we have a conversation about race in @entity6 is that we talk about welfare and we talk about poverty , but what people really want is fairness , " he said			2
" they want people paying their fair share of taxes			1
" i 'll co-sign the last part			0
people should pay their fair share , and that clearly is n't happening			1
it 's true that , at the macro level , the wealthiest people collectively pay most of the taxes in this country			1
but it 's also true that , at the micro level , individual taxpayers in the upper income brackets often take advantage of tax laws that allow them to pay a lower percentage of their income in taxes than everyday @entity6			1
this does n't make the wealthy bad people			2
but it does make for a bad system			0
it 's no wonder that public opinion polls consistently show that @entity6 want the rich to pay more			2
this week , a @entity75 found that 70 % of respondents favor raising taxes on some corporations by eliminating certain tax deductions and 66 % favor increasing income taxes on individuals earning at least $ 200,000 a year and families earning at least $ 250,000			1
now , under what it is being called the @entity86 , the @entity84 wants to give people what they want			1
framing it as an attempt at deficit reduction , the administration is proposing a new minimum rate for people earning more than $ 1 million a year , all to help make sure they pay at least the same percentage of their income as middle - class @entity6			1
predictably , conservatives reacted with howls of protest and accused @entity15 of engaging in class warfare			2
@entity15 responded , " this is not class warfare			2
it 's math. " actually , it 's neither			0
it 's election year gimmickry that stands no chance of going anywhere with a @entity110 - controlled @entity109			2
@entity15 knows that , and that 's why he considers it safe to propose such a plan now rather than in the first half of his administration when the @entity84 was in the hands of @entity10			2
why did n't he propose it then ? i think it 's because it might actually have become law , and then the @entity10 would have owned this new tax policy and have had to answer to voters in future elections			2
this way , @entity15 gets to excite the base in time for his re-election campaign with a proposal that wo n't go anywhere , without having to pay a political price			1
as for the @entity86 itself , it is n't a bad idea			1
but it is n't a particularly good one either			0
the current system , the one @entity3 complains about , is inequitable			0
but the @entity15 plan would just flip the inequity so the wealthy pay more			1
we would go from overburdening the middle class to putting the burden on the rich			0
that would preserve the progressive tax rates , but it would n't be progress			0
the answer lies in a third way : a fairer , flatter tax that lets all @entity6 pay the same percentage of their income in taxes			1
maybe it would be 15 %			0
the specifics are n't as important as the concept			0
about 15 or 20 years ago , you could hear support for that idea from conservative republicans like the late @entity161 , the former congressman and 1996 @entity110 vice presidential nominee , and billionaire @entity164 , who ran for president in 1996 and 2000			0
fiscal conservatives liked a flat tax because they thought it was wrong to punish overachievers who earn a lot of money with confiscatory tax rates , and they saw it as a way of making the tax system more equitable			0
conservatives were right back then			0
yet , they 're wrong now to defend the current system			0
the @entity84 does n't have the right solution			0
but there is no point in denying the problem			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity185			0

@entity185 : @entity75 finds *majority* favor raising taxes on corporations and the rich
" @entity86 " would set minimum tax rate for people earning more than $ 1 million a year
@entity185 says this is an election gimmick because @entity15 knows it wo n't pass
@entity185 : in a fair system , everyone would pay the same percentage of income in taxes
