@entity0 -- the @entity4 administration cleared the way thursday for federal agencies to skip consultations with government scientists when embarking on projects that could impact endangered wildlife , the interior secretary said			1
environmentalists are not happy with president @entity4 's changes to regulations of the @entity14			1
the final regulations to the @entity14 take effect before president @entity4 leaves office in january , but wildlife conservation groups say undoing the damage could take months			1
" the responsibility to initiate consultation will still lie with the federal agency undertaking the action , " interior secretary @entity20 said , but if the agency in question can satisfy the requirement that no harm will come to an endangered species , then there is no need to consult with either the @entity28 or the @entity29			2
the determination of " no harm " will rest with agency bureaucrats instead of scientists , but the agencies can still seek the input of the scientists on a voluntary basis , @entity20 said			2
developers and agencies with large projects have long sought a weakening of @entity14 regulations , which they say delay their projects and add to costs			1
environmental groups contend that this change will take scientists and biologists who have protected endangered species completely out of the mix , leaving wildlife more vulnerable and harder to protect			1
they also say that more than 250,000 citizens voiced their opposition to the measure through the web site regulations.gov			0
" the @entity61 is ignoring the vast majority of the over 200,000 comments they got on this rule change - by moving forward			0
they are basically saying public be damned , " said @entity66 , director of the @entity67 's @entity14			2
the @entity67 maintains that " absent court action , undoing this ruling could take months ... despite today 's feel - good statements , we remain convinced that these changes are illegal			0
" the @entity74 , also voicing strong opposition , said that " in the eleventh hour of his presidency , president @entity4 has rammed through a sweeping overhaul of the @entity14			1
this action eviscerates key protections that have helped safeguard and recover endangered fish , wildlife and plants for the past 35 years			0
' but @entity85 , a spokesman for the @entity61 , said that the change is an " attempt to refocus the resources , time and manpower of both the @entity91 @entity90 and @entity29 to focus on those projects that have a measurable , adverse impact on endangered species			0
" president - elect @entity95 has said he would work to reverse the changes , but since they go into effect before he takes office , his administration would have to reopen the rulemaking process			0
@entity101 could also act to block the new regulations .			0

@entity4 administration changes regulations of @entity14
federal agencies wo *n't* need to seek scientists ' advice on projects impacting wildlife
environmental groups say changes could leave wildlife more vulnerable
