-- whenever @entity2 gets overwhelmed juggling a full - time job and caring for her ailing father , she finds solace in a piece of paper hanging in her office			1
" circumstances do not cause anger , nervousness , worry or depression ... it is how we handle situations that allow these adverse moods , " it says			1
" we actually choose our own attitudes			2
i choose to be calm , well - adjusted and happy ! " she ca n't remember where she found the motto , but focusing on it is one of several coping mechanisms @entity27 has developed since she took her father out of a nursing home in july 2008 and moved him into her two - bedroom apartment in @entity31			1
by then , 72 - year - old @entity27 had suffered three strokes and been diagnosed with diabetes , kidney failure and renal disease , requiring a long list of medication and dialysis three times a week			1
it was only a matter of days before @entity27 became overwhelmed , she says			1
" it was like , ' oh my , what did i get myself into ? ' " the 51 - year - old @entity42 native recalls			1
" sometimes , i would just go into the bathroom and cry			2
" she laughs about it now , but in the beginning , " it was horrible , " she says			2
she 'd go to her job at a manufacturing plant at 8 a.m. , leaving at lunch three times a week to bring her father to a dialysis center			2
she 'd return to work and stay late to make up the time , and then go back to the center to pick him up			2
those were just the normal days			2
if he had an extra appointment with the dentist , podiatrist or general practitioner , she took the day off to shuttle him around and sit in waiting rooms			0
" i put my life on hold , " she said			0
" i was trying to do it all			0
" it 's a scenario familiar to many across the @entity70 as adult children become caregivers for aging and chronically ill loved ones			1
with the first of the baby boomers turning 65 in 2011 , the number of @entity70 entering retirement age is expected to nearly double by 2030 , according to the @entity70 @entity81 ' @entity80			1
as the country braces for the prospect of providing health care to roughly 72 million adults , the impact on caregivers is coming into focus			1
a study released last week found that @entity70 caring for aging and chronically ill relatives reported higher levels of stress , poorer health and a greater tendency to engage in unhealthy behaviors to alleviate stress than the population at large			1
moreover , 55 % of caregivers reported feeling overwhelmed by the task at hand , according to the @entity101 's " @entity103 " survey , which was conducted online among 1,226 adults in the @entity70 in august and september			1
while emphasizing results among caregivers , the survey also found that 22 % of @entity70 reported " extreme stress " and 39 % said their stress had increased over the past year			1
those results were higher among caregivers , who were also more likely than the general population to report doing a poor job at managing and preventing stress , according to the survey 's findings			1
" people who care for loved ones tend to take on a lot , but do n't take care of themselves , " said @entity115 psychologist @entity114 , who helps look after her 90 - year - old father			1
" it 's easy to neglect yourself when you try to be all things to everyone else , but something has to give and it catches up with you			0
" the report emphasizes the public health implications of high stress levels , with caregivers reporting greater rates of high cholesterol , high blood pressure , obesity and depression			1
" it takes an incredible amount of self - awareness but you have to be willing to say i need help , i 'm not omnipotent , " @entity114 said			0
" it 's impossible to be all things to everyone , so what we have to do is have honest straight talk with ourselves about how much we can handle and when we seek help from others			0
" the same lesson applies to those who are stressed , without the added burden of being a caregiver , she said			0
significant sources of stress among respondents included money ( 75 % ) , work ( 70 % ) , the economy ( 67 % ) and relationships ( 58 % ) , according to survey results			1
regardless of the cause , stress often results from taking on too much and not knowing when to stop or ask for help			1
" people feel a lot of pressure , especially in this economy , to not complain or set limits for themselves			1
before you know it , you can have a bodily reaction that can be very negative , from extreme depression to heart attack or stroke , " said @entity165 , chairman and ceo of @entity167 , a residential addiction treatment center in @entity169 , @entity170			0
" @entity70 are chronically sleep - deprived and overworked , so most people could really benefit from taking time for themselves and figuring out a way to relax , " he said			1
for low - income households , a reprieve can be hard to come by			0
even as work piled up around her , @entity27 did n't complain , fearing for her job security			1
she 'd lie awake at night worrying about finances			0
with the rest of her family across the country in @entity191 , she felt alone			0
she lost contact with friends , put on weight and began to neglect basic household chores amid the hustle of work and caring for her father			1
help finally arrived for @entity27 and her father when they discovered an all - inclusive elder care center that accepted @entity203			2
@entity205 's @entity204 , which stands for @entity206 , functions like a day care for the elderly , providing medical services , social outlets and meals under one roof , along with transportation to and from the @entity216 campus			2
" what we usually encounter is a very overwhelmed adult child who is trying to work and ca n't keep things together			1
oftentimes , their house is a mess , they 're financially burdened and they no longer have outside ties to the community because all their time is spent caring for the mom and dad , " said @entity221 , marketing director of @entity205 's @entity204			2
" the adult child is almost at the point of resenting the parent they love and the parent is often depressed and withdrawn and has lost a desire to thrive or connect with the community because he or she does n't want to be more of a burden , " she said			2
now , @entity27 no longer has to bring her father to appointments			0
the program picks him up from home three times a week and brings him to the center , where he receives his medication and has lunch with other clients			0
the program also brings him to the dialysis center and back before returning him home			0
one night a week , someone from @entity204 comes to the home and cleans his room , changes his sheets and provides extras like a foot rub			0
" the goal is she can now enjoy her dad versus having to care for her dad , " said @entity221			2
for @entity27 , it 's working			0
she joined a gym with a goal of taking off her caregiver weight			0
she has the ability to focus on her job and work overtime if she wants			0
at home , she still occasionally takes refuge in the bathroom if she has a disagreement with her dad			0
but it 's a world of a difference from when they first became roommates , almost four years ago			0
" it 's a godsend , " she said			0
" i 'm finally getting my life back			0
