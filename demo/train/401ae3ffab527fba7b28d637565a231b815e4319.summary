-- standing tall in a sport once dubbed " boxing with rackets , " @entity1 has a better analogy to define the particular rigors of squash			1
she calls it " physical chess " -- a test of body and mind in equal measure which the 29 - year - old has mastered like no other female player since 2005			1
the @entity15 has deployed that magical mix of physical prowess and tactical awareness to win seven of the last eight world championships , becoming the undisputed queen of her sport despite her slight stature			1
" squash is all about dimensions , " says @entity25 , who is only 1.63 meters tall and weighs in at just 50 kilograms			2
" you are sharing the same space as your opponent , and not many racket sports have that element in their game , it 's really like you and your opponent being in a gladiator ring , " she told @entity0 's human to @entity30			1
" it 's all about taking your space and control and using the space as well as you can , like physical chess			2
" top - level squash is played in a glass walled arena of just under 50 square meters of floor space and there is nowhere to hide			1
it adds to the sense of the theater for the spectators , but is a daunting prospect for the players			0
" going in to the glass door and getting ready for battle , it 's very , very intense , " @entity25 says			2
despite her small frame , she packs the punch of a heavyweight as opponents are dispatched in double quick time -- and has earned the nickname of " the @entity64			2
" it 's easy to see why			2
on the court she is the epitome of perpetual motion and , like the figure advertising the long - lasting battery , she never seems to run out of power			2
but it is also her mental strength that has helped her win the world title every year since 2008			1
" it has really helped me in the last few years , all the visualization we do , and also setting a game plan that makes me certain that on court you just need to be ready for anything and stay on top of things straight away , " she says			0
dream fulfilled @entity25 was set on the course for squash stardom from an early age , playing her first games in the city of @entity91 when she was just five , encouraged by a sporting father and two elder sisters -- @entity94 and @entity95 -- who both played to national standard			1
from her early teens , @entity25 was recognized as a prodigious talent and her first world junior title in 1999 signaled a further breakthrough			2
but the step up to the senior level proved a testing time and in 2003 she moved to the @entity106 capital @entity107 to work fulltime with @entity110 's former world no. 2 @entity109			1
it has proved a formidable partnership , and @entity25 is quick to recognize the part @entity114 has played in her incredible success			0
" i 've learned some much from her , she 's just been a true mentor for me to show me what 's it like to be at the top			2
" under @entity114 's guidance , success at world senior level first came in @entity126 in 2005			1
" it 's everyone 's dream to be world champion and when it actually did happen , i was just standing speechless			1
i could hardly imagine my dreams had been fulfilled , " @entity25 said			0
" i still have that same exact feeling when i won that world title because it just means so much to me			2
" to have stayed at the summit of her game since then underlines @entity25 's incredible appetite for success			0
" if you are technically sound and really fit and strong and mentally strong , you can be a top squash player , " she said			0
intense training @entity25 makes it sound easy , but hours and hours of intense training are required along with the right balance of rest and recuperation			0
" squash is really , really brutal to your body -- your joints especially your knees and hips and your back -- so we really need to stay on top of things and be careful with over training , " she said			0
@entity25 again underlined her dominance by winning the @entity160 in @entity161 to start 2013 , but the fact she was unable to display her incredible talents in the @entity166 capital at last year 's @entity167 remains a source of continued frustration			1
she has gone on record as saying that she would trade all her world titles for one @entity172 , and squash 's failure to gain inclusion for the 2016 games in @entity177 was a major disappointment , with golf and rugby sevens instead being included			1
@entity25 is an integral part of the 2020 @entity183 campaign for squash , which was unveiled at the @entity160 earlier this month			2
it is also supported by supported by @entity186 and @entity187 , gold medal winners in rowing and cycling for @entity166 last year			0
" @entity191 pretty much has the whole package on what an @entity167 sport should be and we have proven ourselves time and time again that our game has so much to offer			1
we are the complete sport , " @entity25 said			0
@entity167 bid " our last two campaigns , where we missed @entity161 and @entity177 , we 've learned a lot and we are ready to take up our case for 2020			1
" @entity25 would be in her late 30s by the time of the @entity204 , but she will try to extend her career if squash finally convinces the @entity207 that it should be included			2
" i would do my best to stay in the game and to play the @entity167 for the very first time , but if i ca n't make it then , at least i was part of the campaign , " she said			1
for the moment , @entity25 savors her involvement in the @entity215 , when she was one of five @entity15 sports personalities chosen to run with the @entity167 torch on its worldwide tour			1
" it was truly special , " she remembers			0
she has represented her country in major events , winning four gold medals at the @entity223 since 1998 in @entity224 when she was only 15			0
gold medal success in the @entity226 eluded @entity25 until she won the singles title in @entity228 in 2010			0
going into the 2006 edition in @entity230 , @entity110 , @entity25 was reigning world champion and favorite , but was beaten by her great rival @entity233 in the semifinals			1
revenge for that defeat came in the @entity237 in @entity238 at the end of the year , where she beat the @entity110 -- who is now a @entity106 citizen -- in an epic final , considered one of the greatest in women 's squash history			1
total domination for @entity25 , it was a victory that set the foundation for her near total domination until the current day			0
" it was just the turning point when i won that second world title , it just proved the point -- this is where i 'm at , i 'm ready to move forward			0
it just gave me the assurance i could do still more			0
" @entity233 and her sister @entity254 continued to prove a thorn in @entity25 's side , contesting the 2007 @entity237 title to break her winning streak , but she has since claimed five straight global crowns			0
setbacks have proved few and far between , going through 2010 unbeaten with her @entity226 gold in @entity263 a particular highlight			0
whether @entity25 can withstand the sport 's constant physical demands to extend her career for a possible shot at 2020 @entity167 glory remains to be seen , but few would deny her the opportunity			1
the decision on the hosts for the @entity204 will be made by the @entity207 in september 2013 , when the delegates will also add one more sport to the program			0
@entity191 will be battling it out with the likes of softball , roller sports and wakeboarding to gain admission , representing the last chance for @entity25 to fulfill her golden dream			0
" anybody involved with squash wants to see the sport get there , everybody thinks it 's already in there and just assume we are part of the @entity167 , " she said			1
" it 's very heartbreaking when we are just not part of it			0
