editor 's note : @entity2 , who anchored the weekend editions of " @entity4 , " is leader in residence and a full - time faculty member in the journalism department of @entity8			1
a recipient of three national @entity11 with 40 years experience as a broadcast journalist , @entity2 was the first black woman to anchor a network evening news broadcast			1
@entity2 says women are gaining prominence at a time when major network news is endangered			1
( @entity18 ) -- @entity19 now joins @entity20 as anchor of a major network evening newscast , leaving @entity23 the sole man			1
since i have personally worked for 30 years for the advancement of women in broadcast journalism , i guess i am supposed to be delighted			1
why am i not ? because it took so darned long -- and tv news is on life support			1
no disrespect to @entity19 or @entity20			1
i consider them friends and i take pride in their accomplishments			0
they have proven their talents and journalistic credentials			1
we had to wait until 2009 ? women began entering television news in significant numbers in the 1970s during the women 's liberation movement			2
in fact , i started my network career in 1974			0
the major impact on the hiring of women resulted after 16 women filed a class action sex discrimination suit in federal court against @entity54 in 1975			0
two years later in a $ 2 million out - of - court settlement , the network promised to act affirmatively and hire , promote and raise the salaries of a large percentage of women over the next five years			1
@entity60 and @entity4 saw the writing on the wall and suddenly discovered many women -- inside and outside their news divisions -- qualified to be more than researchers and secretaries			2
we women in television news thought we had " arrived " when @entity4 chose @entity70 to co-anchor the evening news with @entity72 in 1976			2
it turned out to be a match made in hell			0
@entity72 was so upset about sharing airtime with a woman that he refused to speak to @entity70 , except on the news set			0
the ill - fated experiment ended two years later when @entity72 left in disgust for @entity60 and @entity70 was ousted as anchor			0
while newswomen were continuing to move onward and upward in network television , it took another 16 years -- 1993 -- before we saw another woman in a network anchor chair			2
at @entity60 @entity88 was paired with @entity89 on the " @entity90			0
" during her stint as co-anchor , @entity88 was sent to @entity93 to report on figure skater @entity95 's activities following an assault on her chief skating rival , @entity97			0
@entity89 remained at the anchor desk			0
can you even imagine @entity89 spending days out of the studio reporting on someone like @entity95 ? no , you ca n't			0
@entity103 was axed from the program after two years amid tension with her co-anchor			0
in 2006 , 13 years @entity108 , @entity20 made history when @entity60 named her the solo anchor of the " @entity90			0
" she had a rough time from the blistering criticism most women " firsts " have to endure			0
but she has held her own and grown in stature , enough so that @entity4 has given @entity19 her shot			2
it took almost 40 years for this unique state of affairs			1
so , why are women getting these opportunities now ? well , i 'm a cynic			0
the reason is that broadcast television news is dying			0
for more than 20 years , network newscasts have been called " dinosaurs			2
" media experts say the shows are in their death throes			0
network news budgets have been slashed and employees have been fired and laid off			1
the audience for network news has been dwindling year after year as viewers turn to cable or the internet for their news , or avoid the news altogether			1
i wish @entity19 and @entity20 the best			2
millions of @entity138 still watch network news programs , but they are only a semblance of what they were in terms of quality and content			1
with fewer resources and the death knell sounding , why not put women in charge of the network evening news programs ? when things could n't be worse , it 's okay for women to be in charge			1
sad to say , but i do n't believe the evening network newscasts , nor @entity20 and @entity19 as the anchors , will be around for very long			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : women have fought for bigger role in tv news for 40 years
she says @entity19 has proven her talents and credentials
@entity2 says it took too long for women to be given prominence
she says network news is endangered as viewership declines
