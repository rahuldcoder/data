launched in the @entity12 two years ago , @entity6 provides users with access to 3 - d " pedestrian 's - eye " views of urban areas by zooming into the lowest level on its @entity20 and @entity21 applications			0

the images are obtained from cars specially - fitted with cameras that drive around towns and cities taking panoramic 360 degree shots of everything from pedestrians in the street , to customers sitting in street cafes			0
despite pledging to recognize local privacy laws , @entity1 has come under fire from privacy campaigners who fear the application could be abused by criminals or even snooping government agencies			1
do you agree ? share your thoughts below in april , a group of villagers in a picturesque @entity53 village chased away one of the search engine 's camera cars as it attempted to photograph their homes			0
fearing the appearance of their well appointed properties on the web site would attract criminals scouting for burglary targets , villagers in @entity59 , north of @entity11 , summoned the police after blocking the car			0
a month earlier , the @entity67 reported that @entity1 was forced to pull a number of images from @entity6 after receiving complaints about pictures that included a man entering a @entity11 sex shop , and a drunken reveler being sick at a bus stop			1

we have received a request for further information from the @entity4 dpa and we are happy to continue discussing these issues with them and provide information they request			2
