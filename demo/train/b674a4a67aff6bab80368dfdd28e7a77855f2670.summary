@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity8 pilots his single - engine bush plane low over a herd of elephants , his trained eye scanning for calves			1
he 's spotted 21 in just the last few months			2
" see that baby drinking ? " he asks , as he dips the left wing over a watering hole			0
it 's something @entity1 's @entity0 has been without for nearly five years			1
large - scale @entity16 poaching operations from across the border have decimated the park 's elephants			1
in the span of just a few years they slaughtered 90 % of the park 's elephant population			1
@entity8 , the park 's director , says until now , the survivors were too traumatized to mate			1
@entity0 is both blessed and cursed by its geography			1
the 3,000 square kilometers of pristine @entity28 is a crucial habitat for the species , separating desert to the north and savannah to the south			0
but the park is also surrounded by conflict			2
to the east is @entity38 , to the south , @entity40 , and to the west is @entity42			0
opinion : elephants slaughtered for trinkets and terrorism " there were less weapons in the past , " says @entity47 by , president of @entity1			1
" today all around us there are more weapons and more men who can use them			0
all of this leads us to believe that national security , and regional security may be threatened by the poachers			2
" we fly towards the park 's northern boundary , the landscape below dotted with nomad tents and their livestock , and the occasional camel caravan crossing ancient trading tracks			1
the terrain here is rugged , lawless and largely inaccessible by car , making it ideal for poachers			2
it 's been that way for centuries , @entity8 tells us from his pilot 's seat			2
hunting elephants here is nothing new			2
what is , are the weapons and tactics			0
" they operate in small groups , they are usually about four to five people on horseback , they 've got good communication systems , satellite phones , local phones , " he says			0
" they are absolute professionals in what they do			0
except the shooting â € ” it 's just done in a massacre way			2
they just machine gun as many as they can , shoot as many as they can , get the ivory and then move on			2
" in september 2012 , @entity103 , which manages @entity0 , saw six of its rangers killed in a sophisticated three - pronged strike on their hillside outpost			1
piles of stones mark the graves where they were buried			0
dark patches still outline where the tents once stood , burnt to the ground by the poachers			2
it 's the first time one of the ranger 's sons , 18 - year - old @entity120 , has visited the site where his father was slain			2
" i am remembering everything about him , what he must have been doing , what happened to him , " @entity120 says in hushed tones , his eyes filled with pain			0
the attack , @entity8 tells us , was revenge for a raid his rangers conducted on the poacher 's camp just weeks before			1
evidence collected from the camp gave @entity8 more evidence into just what they were up against			0
they found thousands of rounds of ammunition , satellite phones containing images of hundreds of slaughtered elephants that matched those of carcasses in @entity151 , linking the poachers to one of the biggest elephant slaughters in decades			1
also recovered at the site were @entity16 military uniforms , one identified as similar to those issued to @entity16 's @entity159 paramilitary service , notorious for its brutality and linked to atrocities in @entity38 , and a stamped leave slip from the @entity164			1
this month , the park , with the help of an outside agency , traced the ammunitions back to @entity169			0
@entity16 's minister of information , @entity170 , denies the military link			1
" @entity16 has an ammunition factory , but the presence of @entity16 ammunition in @entity1 may have occurred in many different ways , " he said			1
" @entity16 gets blamed for everything			1
" the war in neighboring @entity40 is bringing even more threats			1
as @entity1 living in the car flee the violence many return to the area which borders the park , where they have roots			1
like so many others , @entity185 , 29 , is coming home to escape the violence			0
his wife and three - year - old daughter were brutally murdered			0
' machetes -- i did n't have the courage to look at them , " he tells us as he unloads his luggage at a repatriation center			0
" my heart would n't let me look at them			0
" he 's hoping to escape the haunting memory and says he 'll try to look for work in agriculture			1
but the influx of refugees , some of whom have weapons from the conflict , ties to the military or the @entity213 rebels is a concern to local leaders			0
there are n't enough jobs here to go around and poaching is lucrative , especially for those battle - hardened			0
since taking control of the park in 2010 , @entity8 's employer , the non-profit @entity103 , has managed to keep the remaining elephants relatively safe			1
@entity8 's team are collaring elephants , allowing them to track and respond to threats with younger , more highly trained rangers			1
he tells us that one of central @entity230 's largest herds is secure for now			0
but , he says , " we have to prepare ourselves			0
we will become a target again in the future			0

rangers in @entity1 's @entity0 face a serious threat from poaching operations
in recent years , park rangers have been executed in their line of work
90 % of the park 's elephants have been slaughtered for their ivory
poachers have come from neighboring @entity16 ; now the @entity249 war presents a new threat
