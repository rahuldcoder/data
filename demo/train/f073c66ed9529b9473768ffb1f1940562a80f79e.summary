and now ... @entity3 ? the " @entity7 " host , radio personality and seemingly ubiquitous showbiz presence has co-founded a tech startup that seeks to make it easier for people to type on their iphones			1
@entity3 also is helping bankroll the company , @entity12 , which makes an @entity14 case that includes a @entity16 style keyboard			1
the @entity18 - enabled accessory , for the @entity14 and @entity19 , was apparently the result of a dinner shared by @entity3 and co-founder @entity22 , a real estate developer and serial entrepreneur who , like his partner , does n't like typing on a touchscreen			1
" one night , we were out to dinner and both had our phones on the table			1
two people , four phones ! " reads a blurb on the @entity12 website			2
we looked at each other and thought there was an easy solution to the problem			2
" they said they both looked for @entity14 keyboards and , when they were n't happy with what they found , decided to make their own			2
the case , which sells for $ 99 , is available for pre-order and is scheduled to ship next month			2
but ... @entity3 ? really ? it 's his first venture into the tech startups , to be sure			1
he joins the likes of @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 ( yes , @entity54 ) as an entertainer dipping a toe into the tech world			1
reaction online was predictably snarky			0
" surely this must be a typo ... , " one @entity60 user wrote			0
( we see what you did there			0
) not everyone was down on the idea , though			0
... the @entity70 is coming			0
the @entity70 is coming , " tweeted another			0
" this could change everything			0

the @entity75 case was *dreamed* up at a dinner with *tv* host @entity3
the case adds a @entity16 - style keyboard
@entity3 joins @entity52 , @entity53 in the tech startup world
