-- @entity1 has found a good man			0
he loves her and her 16 - year - old daughter			0
his work provides their income and allows her to attend nursing school			2
they married two years ago and their future was set			0
@entity12 came to the @entity13 illegally and has been living as an undocumented immigrant			1
at any time he could be deported to his native @entity15			2
although undocumented , @entity12 was able to find work as a contracting muralist in @entity18 , where @entity1 -- a @entity13 citizen -- was born and raised			1
he learned to speak @entity19 in less than three years for work and the need to communicate with the " love of his life " as he put it			0
" i love this country and have made it my home			0
i want to be able to contribute to this country and give back in any way i can , " said @entity12			2
he said he got his tax id number as soon as he started working because he wanted to get started on the right path and pay his taxes			0
@entity1 also depends on @entity12 for emotional support as she suffers from @entity36			2
she is a victim of sexual molestation and suffered mental and physical abuse while growing up			0
they 'd always planned for @entity12 to apply for citizenship , but were afraid of going into the system that would require him to return to @entity15 for up to 10 years			2
" i used to have nightmares about @entity12 and i separating			1
i used to worry so much about it , " said @entity1 , " i would n't know what to do without him			0
if he left i would n't know how to run his business			0
" now @entity1 and @entity12 , whose last names we 've agreed to withhold to protect their identity , are entering that system , hopeful that they wo n't be separated			1
come march , many mixed - status families will breathe a sigh of relief knowing they wo n't have to remain separate for a long period of time while they apply to become legal residents in the @entity13 , according to a new rule made by the @entity60 announced last week			1
the new rule does not guarantee legal status to the undocumented immigrant -- the family still has to prove that the deportation of the spouse or parent would cause " extreme hardship " to the @entity13 citizen			1
" i 'm so relieved he gets to stay here while we go through this process , it makes a big difference , " @entity1 said			0
@entity76 , @entity12 's immigration lawyer , is optimistic that his waiver will be approved			2
@entity79 director @entity78 said in a press release : " the law is designed to avoid extreme hardship to @entity13 citizens , which is precisely what this rule achieves			1
" " the change will have a significant impact on @entity13 families by greatly reducing the time family members are separated from those they rely upon			1
" under current law , immediate relatives of @entity13 citizens who are not eligible to adjust status in the @entity13 to become lawful permanent residents must leave the country and obtain an immigrant visa in their home country			1
those who have accrued more than six months of unlawful presence while in the @entity13 must obtain a waiver to overcome the unlawful presence bar before they can return to the @entity13 after departing to obtain an immigrant visa			2
" this final rule facilitates the legal immigration process and reduces the amount of time that @entity13 citizens are separated from their immediate relatives who are in the process of obtaining an immigrant visa , " said secretary of homeland security @entity103 in a press release			1
@entity113 fears that because the eligibility is so specific to a certain group of people , many undocumented immigrants are going to be confused as to why they do not qualify and suggests they seek out legal counsel			0
she said the new regulation was a huge step forward and sadly long overdue			0
undocumented immigrants married to a @entity13 citizen are the most vocal group said @entity113 , and if this provision works , this might extend to other groups			1
the new rule does not apply to @entity13 children with an undocumented parent			1
in other words , you can not give birth to your own waiver			0
the child , whether undocumented or not , must have a @entity13 citizen as a parent			1
a legitimate concern for many -- if the waiver is denied -- is that individuals are also putting the government on notice that an undocumented spouse or parent lives in the @entity13 because it might put themselves at risk for deportation			1
" applying for this waiver means that you are putting yourself out there			0
@entity151 told me that their priorities are to go after criminal aliens , " said @entity113 , but added , " undocumented immigrants without a criminal history do not need to worry			0
" the @entity157 applauds the @entity159 administration for their rule change			1
@entity157 teamed up with the @entity161 to advocate to keep women and their families together at the we belong together campaign			2
during the past two christmases they organized thousands of letters from children to be sent to congress asking them to stop deporting their parents			0
" this is clearly a step in the right direction , but a lot more work needs to be done , " said @entity171 , @entity172 at @entity157 in an interview , " we need a broader comprehensive immigration reform that provides a pathway to citizenship			1
@entity182 needs to address the whole package			0

new rule can reduces time @entity13 citizens are separated from undocumented relatives
" i used to have nightmares about @entity12 and i separating . i would n't know what to do without him "
@entity157 applauds @entity159 administration
" this is clearly a step in the right direction but a lot more work needs to be done "
