-- massacres such as @entity2 are horrifying and heart - rending			1
they are also nothing like the typical @entity7 gun murder			1
the typical murder has one victim , not many			1
the typical murder is committed with a handgun , not a rifle			1
and in the typical murder , both the perpetrator and the victim are young black men			1
blacks are six times as likely as whites to be the victim of a homicide			1
blacks are seven times as likely to commit a homicide			2
the horrifying toll of gun violence on black @entity7 explains why black @entity7 are so much more likely than whites to favor gun control			1
conversely , fears of being victimized by violence explain why so many white @entity7 -- especially older and more conservative white @entity7 -- insist on the right to bear arms in self - protection			1
they see gun violence as something that impinges on them from the outside			1
they do n't blame guns for gun violence			1
they blame a particular subset of the population			0
and they do n't see why they should lose their right because some subset of the population abuses theirs			1
a writer i greatly admire , @entity45 , an independent - minded conservative , gives voice to such feelings in an article posted this weekend on the @entity51 website			1
@entity45 expresses himself forcefully and frankly			0
that frankness should be welcomed , because the more clearly a mistaken idea is put , the faster we can reach a better understanding			0
@entity45 wrote : " yesterday the @entity56 published a lengthy analysis of the 2012 murder stats in the city			2
take a look at this pdf of one of the inside pages			0
last year , 83 people died by homicide in @entity66			0
of that number , 87 % were black , and 87 % were male			0
two - thirds had been in trouble with the law before , and one - third had been in trouble with the law for drugs			0
the median age of victims : 26			0
" of the perpetrators , the median age was 22			0
get this : 96 % of them were black , and 90 % were male			0
almost two - thirds had previous arrests			0
one out of four had a drug record			0
" most of the murders took place in the poorest parts of the city			0
" what can we learn from these statistics ? that murder in @entity66 is almost entirely about young black men from the poor part of town killing other young black men from the poor part of town			2
it 's mostly a matter of thugs killing thugs			0
" if you look at the world that way , gun control must seem a pointless diversion from the real problem : not guns , but one particular group of gun owners			1
but life is not so neatly separated			0
guns offer equal opportunity tragedies			0
more than 8,000 white americans had to be treated for nonfatal gun injuries in 2008			2
eighty percent of those who commit suicide with a gun are white males			2
the gun that the suburban family buys to protect itself from " thugs killing thugs " ends up killing its own : one important new study finds that a gun kept in the house is 43 times more likely to kill a household member than to be used in self - defense			2
thugs killing thugs ? maybe			0
but many of those seeming thugs are carrying guns for the same reason that people who consider themselves respectable carry them : in a futile quest to protect themselves with greater firepower			0
one person can find safety that way			0
but if two people carry firearms , a confrontation that might otherwise have ended in words or blows ends instead with one man dead , and the other man on his way to prison for life			0
@entity151 sends more people to prison than any other state , at a total cost of almost 7 % of its state budget			0
prison is always expensive , but the incarceration of murderers costs the most , because they remain in prison to the end			0
the oldest of @entity151 's prisoners cost the state almost $ 80,000 a year , including their health care			0
widespread gun ownership means not only more gun killings , but also more gun maimings and cripplings			2
the @entity168 's @entity167 hailed the ability of a " good guy " with a gun to stop a " bad guy " with a gun			2
sixty seconds later , however , that bad guy may need a wheelchair for life			0
we ca n't dismiss these human costs as pertaining to only somebody else			2
they are all part of us			0
yet the urge to subdivide runs strong among @entity7			1
monday on @entity183 , the popular conservative commentator @entity182 claimed that the murder rate among white @entity7 is as low as the murder rate in @entity186			1
" so perhaps it 's not a gun problem , " she concluded			1
" perhaps it 's a demographic problem			2
" but countries can not dismiss the sufferings of great blocks of their people by dismissing some " demographics " as unworthy of attention			0
if you ignore @entity7 's poor , you can make all kinds of problems disappear from view			1
not counting the poor and minorities , the country does not have an obesity epidemic			0
not counting the poor and minorities , the @entity7 has perfectly adequate schools			1
not counting the poor and minorities , @entity7 would have a higher average income			1
likewise , not counting hurricanes , @entity7 would not have so many natural disasters			1
not counting divorces , @entity7 would have more intact families			1
not counting wars , @entity7 would have a smaller public debt			1
but what 's the point of this exercise ? the people who make up @entity7 count as @entity7 , and their problems count as @entity7 's problems			1
their problems do not occur in isolation , but are manifestations of failures to which all @entity7 contributed together			1
those young men in @entity66 who are killing each other in such horrific numbers do not manufacture their own guns			0
they did not organize the gun trade that brings the guns to their town			2
they did not write the laws that prevent their town government from acting against guns			2
they carry guns -- and misuse guns -- thanks to a national system of gun regulation that makes guns easily accessible to those least likely to use guns responsibly			2
the gun laws intended to put guns into the hands of " good guys " are the laws that also multiply guns in the hands of " bad guys " -- bad guys who might not have become such bad guys if the guns had not been available to their hands			1
the price of redefining gun violence as an issue pertaining only to " those people " -- of casting and recasting the gun statistics to make them less grisly if only " those people " are toted under some different heading in some different ledger -- the price of that redefinition is to lose our ability to think about the problem at all			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity265 .			1

@entity265 : typical @entity7 gun murder is n't like @entity2 massacre
he says conservative commentators wrong to distance whites from problem
