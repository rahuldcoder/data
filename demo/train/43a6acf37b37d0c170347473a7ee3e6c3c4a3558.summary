@entity0 -- the alleged victim in the @entity4 sexual assault case has filed a libel lawsuit against the @entity6 and five of its reporters after the newspaper reported that the woman was a prostitute , according to court filings			1
the woman , a native of @entity13 who has not been identified publicly , accused the newspaper of publishing articles with false and defamatory information in the effort to bolster sales			1
her attorney , @entity19 , filed the claim tuesday in @entity0 's @entity23 state @entity21			1
a spokeswoman for the @entity6 , @entity25 , responded to the lawsuit saying " we stand by our reporting			1
" the @entity6 -- which has earned a reputation for its sensationalist headlines and provocative reporting -- on july 2 published the headline " @entity34 cleaning up as ' hooker , ' " citing anonymous sources			1
the article said the woman -- a maid at a @entity45 hotel -- was " doing double duty as a prostitute , collecting cash on the side from male guests , @entity36 has learned			1
" on july 3 , the newspaper reported that the alleged victim , which the newspaper did not name in its stories , has " a regular fleet of gentlemen callers , " ranging from " wealthy clients she met at the @entity56 ( hotel ) to counterfeit - merchandise hawkers and livery - cab drivers , said sources close to the defense investigation			1
" the filing says @entity36 knew , or should have known , that the statements were false prior to publication			0
the newspaper 's articles were then repeated by " multiple news organizations around the world , " the filing said			2
@entity1 did not carry the @entity6 reports			1
a source with knowledge of the investigation told @entity1 that so far , " no evidence has been found that she is a prostitute			2
" the alleged victim , 32 , accused the former head of the @entity75 of criminal sexual acts and sexual abuse that allegedly occurred in may inside his @entity45 hotel suite			0
but the woman 's credibility was largely undermined friday when prosecutors announced publicly that she had been less than truthful with authorities about some aspects of her life and her whereabouts immediately after the alleged attack			2
the announcement appears to have left the case on shaky ground , but manhattan district attorney @entity92 said he is not ready to drop charges			0
" prosecutors said on friday their investigation is continuing , and that remains the case , " @entity92 spokeswoman @entity94 told @entity1			2
" no decisions have been made			0
" meanwhile , @entity4 is facing separate accusations of attempted rape in @entity100			0
a @entity4 lawyer in @entity100 said he had filed a counterclaim against @entity103 for " false declarations			0
" @entity100 prosecutors are expected to review the complaint and determine whether there is enough evidence to press charges			0
