choosing healthier foods at the grocery store may soon be a little easier			2
the @entity2 is proposing several changes to the nutrition labels you see on packaged foods and beverages			1
if approved , the new labels would place a bigger emphasis on total calories , added sugars and certain nutrients , such as @entity13 and potassium			1
the @entity2 is also proposing changes to serving size requirements in an effort to more accurately reflect what people usually eat or drink			1
for example , if you buy a 20 - ounce soda , you 're probably not going to stop drinking at the 8 - ounce mark			1
the new rules would require that entire soda bottle to be one serving size -- making calorie counting simpler			1
this is the first overhaul for nutrition labels since the @entity2 began requiring them more than 20 years ago			1
there has been a shift in shoppers ' priorities as nutrition is better understood and people learn what they should watch for on a label , administration officials said			2
" you as a parent and a consumer should be able to walk into your local grocery store , pick up an item off the shelf , and be able to tell whether it 's good for your family , " first lady @entity41 said in a press release			0
" so this is a big deal , and it 's going to make a big difference for families all across this country			2
" the proposed labels would remove the " calories from fat " line you currently see on labels , focusing instead on total calories found in each serving			1
nutritionists have come to understand that the type of fat you 're eating matters more than the calories from fat			0
as such , the breakdown of total fat vs. saturated and trans fat would remain			0
put down that doughnut : @entity2 takes on trans fat the proposed labels would also note how much added sugar is in a product			1
right now , it 's hard to know what is naturally occurring sugar and what has been added by the manufacturer			1
" now when @entity85 pull a product from the supermarket shelf , they will have a clear idea of how much sugar that product really contains , " @entity83 ceo @entity82 said			2
chemically , added sugar is the same , but studies show many @entity85 eat more sugar than they realize			1
the @entity83 recommends you limit added sugar to no more than half your daily discretionary calories			1
that means for @entity85 men , about 150 calories a day , or nine teaspoons			0
for women it 's a smaller amount -- no more than 100 calories per day from added sugar , or about six teaspoons of sugar			1
the @entity2 also plans to update the daily values for certain nutrients such as sodium , dietary fiber and @entity13 for instance , the daily limit for sodium was 2,400 milligrams			1
if the new rules take effect , the daily value will be 2,300 milligrams , administration officials said			0
food and beverage companies would also be required to declare the amount of @entity13 and potassium in a product , as well as calcium and iron			0
research shows @entity85 tend not to consume enough @entity13 for good bone health			0
and potassium is essential in keeping your blood pressure in check			0
vegetarian diet could help lower your blood pressure administration officials said about 17 % of current serving size requirements will be changing , and the @entity2 is adding 25 categories for products that were n't commonly around 20 years ago ( think pot stickers , sesame oil and sun - dried tomatoes )			1
most of the required serving sizes will be going up ; no one eats just half a cup of ice cream , for instance			1
others , like yogurt , will be going down			0
" this will help people better understand how many calories they actually consume , especially if they plan to eat all the food in a container or package , " @entity82 said			0
while the @entity83 and advocacy group @entity149 commended the @entity2 's changes , they noted that there was more to do			2
both organizations said the @entity2 's sodium recommendation was still too high			2
@entity82 said the association will continue to recommend sodium intake be limited to 1,500 milligrams a day			0
@entity149 said it will also request that the @entity2 include a daily value of 25 grams for added sugars			1
" thus , the nutrition facts label for a 16.9 - ounce bottle of soda would indicate that its 58 grams of added sugars represents 230 percent of the @entity164 , " the group said in an e-mail			1
with this announcement , the @entity2 has opened a 90 - day comment period , during which experts and members of the public can provide input on the proposed rules			1
the @entity2 will then issue a final rule			2
officials said they hope to complete the process this year			0
manufacturing companies will then have two years to implement the changes			0
nutrition labels have remained pretty much the same for decades			1
it was n't until the late 1960s that most food labels listed any nutrition information			2
at the time , labels with calorie or sodium counts were mainly used on products the @entity2 considered to have " special dietary uses , " for people with high blood pressure who were watching sodium , for instance			1
most people were making meals at home then , so there was n't a huge demand for this information			0
that changed as more people started eating processed foods			0
noticing the trend , the @entity199 pulled together a conference of nutritionists and food manufacturers in 1969			0
nutrition labeling was voluntary at first			0
it was n't until 1990 that the @entity2 required nutrition labels for most prepared and packaged foods			1
labels for raw produce and fish remain voluntary			0
more @entity85 today are interested in what 's on these nutrition labels , research shows			1
a @entity215 study released last month showed 42 % of working - age adults between 29 and 68 looked at these labels most or all of the time when shopping			2
some 57 % of @entity85 older than 68 did as well			0
that 's up from 2007 , when 34 % of working - age adults looked at the label , and 51 % of @entity85 older than 68 did			0
the increase is good news as the @entity85 struggles with an obesity epidemic			0
some studies have shown that people who read labels eat healthier			2
more than a third of all @entity85 are obese , according to the @entity230			0
obesity rates drop for 2 - to 5 - year olds			2

the @entity2 is proposing changes to nutrition labels
new labels make calorie counts easier to read and *highlight* added sugar
@entity2 also wants to change required serving sizes in some products , such as soda
proposal will undergo 90 - day comment period , may be implemented next year
