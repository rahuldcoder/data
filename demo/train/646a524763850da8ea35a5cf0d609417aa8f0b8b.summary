@entity0 -- keep debating whether video games are art if you wish			1
at @entity6 , the world 's biggest gaming expo , it 's a closed question			1
here , video games are definitely art -- and a gallery - style exhibit aims to prove it to as many people as care to look			1
" @entity19 , " a juried art show now in its eighth year , opened on tuesday , showcasing work that supporters say is finally receiving its just due in the sometimes - cloistered art world			1
" there actually is no line at all between the video - game artist and the fine - art world , " said @entity20 , an independent curator who has worked at galleries including the @entity22 in @entity23 and the @entity24 in @entity25 and was one of the jurors for the show			1
" there 's no difference to me			2
this is as high - quality an exhibit as could be			2
" seventeen images were selected for the show out of hundreds of submissions			2
after showing at the @entity6 , the exhibit will spend the next year traveling to festivals and conventions around the world			1
as may be expected , there were dragons and spaceships , creepy monsters and brave heroes depicted in the show			2
but other pieces might not be pegged as video - game images at all if not for the setting			1
" @entity52 , " by @entity53 from the game " @entity55 : @entity60 , " is a rendering of a highly abstracted shipyard that would n't look out of place next to work by @entity59			2
" @entity61 , " by @entity62 from " @entity63 : @entity69 , " is a detailed look at the interior of an empty and vaguely ominous @entity68 @entity67 pub. the prints on display at the opening in the @entity73 were created for video games that range from massive hits from major companies to small , independent games			0
some were touched up slightly for their gallery debut , but many are directly lifted from gameplay			0
@entity83 's entry , " @entity84 , " from last year 's " @entity85 , " depicts an enormous monster hulking over the game 's main character , peering down at him with a look hovering somewhere between perplexed and annoyed			1
@entity83 , a senior character artist for @entity90 , had his first gallery showing at " into the @entity92			0
" video - game art , like other emerging art forms , needed time to earn wider acceptance , he said			1
" you look at all kinds of media that were new -- anything that 's new , people are n't really comfortable with initially , " he said , citing the way comic - book art is now taken seriously , but only after decades of scorn			1
" i think the longer they 're exposed to it , they come to be more comfortable with it			0
" the past year may have been a turning point in the art world 's comfort with video games			1
the @entity112 announced that , in 2012 , it will be opening " @entity115 , " an exhibition spanning four decades of gaming images			0
and , last month , the @entity116 announced video games would join film , radio and other media that are eligible for government support			0
" there are signs that this is really happening , " said @entity122 , president of the @entity123 which , along with the @entity125 , sponsors " into the @entity92			0
" " we now have a realization within the government that what we do is art , " @entity122 said			0
@entity122 compares video - game art to photography			1
in its infancy , art communities dismissed photo - taking as a simple act of point - and - shoot , merely copying an image that already existed			2
" i think we had the same thing here , " he said			0
" but the public is catching up			0
" by showcasing the work in " into the @entity92 , " @entity122 and others hope to speed that process			0
" every time traditional fine arts people look at what we have in our industry , they immediately recognize that the artists within our industry are exceptional , " he said .			0
