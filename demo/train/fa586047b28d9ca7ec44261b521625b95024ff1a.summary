-- @entity2 aviation company @entity1 is taking a " major bet " on the notoriously cut - throat passenger plane market , spending around $ 3.5 billion to compete with well - established rivals @entity6 and @entity7 , its chief executive @entity5 says			1
the money will be invested in @entity1 's new @entity11 aircraft , which has the capacity to seat 100 to 150 passengers			1
@entity1 faces obstacles , including the dominance of its competitors in the market and the eurozone financial crisis , which has hit the aviation industry hard			1
but the company is in a strong position to target a market that has been " under - served " by the major players , @entity5 said			1
watch : how to buy planes " so far , we 've been serving customers up to about 100 seats , more in the regional segment			0
now we 're cracking into more of the mainline segment			0
we 're investing about $ 3.5 billion -- for the size of our company that is a very significant investment , " he told @entity0			1
" if you look at our company we have two groups -- a group of about $ 10 billion on the rail side and $ 10 billion in aerospace			1
but it is a major bet for the corporation			1
" cutting edge design @entity5 said @entity1 's competitive edge lies in the design of its planes			1
until now , this market had largely been served by the @entity46 and @entity6			2
however these smaller versions of planes -- called " shrinks " --- were also much heavier			0
the other option was @entity53 company @entity52 's @entity51 -- known as a " stretch " -- but it can not fly as far in one go			0
in comparison , @entity5 said @entity1 's @entity11 will deliver an " optimized product " built specifically for the 100 to 150 - seat market			1
on its website the company says its aircraft will be lighter and more fuel efficient , yet provide a " best - in - class , wide - body cabin environment			2
" taking on the major players @entity1 's ambitions -- even with this new approach to design -- are high , given the long history of @entity7 and @entity6 in these markets			1
founded in 1942 , @entity1 is a relatively new kid on the aviation block			2
the company expanded from trains to planes in the 1980s and is now the third largest aircraft manufacturer			2
its aerospace division now employs 33,600 people , with an annual turnover of Â £ 8.6 billion			0
according to @entity5 , the company now has the scale to take such challenges			2
watch : three ceos in a cockpit @entity5 is hoping to capitalize on demand for around 7,000 aircraft in the 100 to 150 - seat segment over the next 20 years			1
so far @entity1 has secured 330 commitments and 138 firm orders for its new aircraft			2
@entity5 , who worked in the automotive industry for 30 years before moving to planes , said : " we feel very comfortable with the level of production we have going forwards , so we are very happy with our position			0
" beyond @entity97 as @entity97 markets continue to take a battering , @entity5 says @entity1 will be expanding its focus elsewhere			1
in the past year the company has doubled its sales force in emerging countries , with a renewed push in the @entity105 " in @entity97 typically things have been slower than usual , and this is a fortress market for us			0
we 've been very strong in @entity97 so we are feeling the impact of the economic uncertainty , " @entity5 noted			0
watch : airlines brace for economic impact " the good thing is the rest of the world is not necessarily in the same shape			0
if you look at emerging countries we 've been doing very well , " he said			0
" we 're focusing elsewhere			0
the @entity105 has also been picking up which is a very , very important market for us			0
