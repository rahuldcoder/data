@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 , @entity4 's hair would have walked into a room five minutes before he did			1
when he first hit the big time in 1996 , he rocked the biggest , fluffiest afro this side of the ' 70s and evoked a distinctly bohemian vibe			1
now , the neo-soul superstar is back after an eight - year self - imposed hiatus , and he looks like a new man , with close - cropped hair and a wardrobe of elegantly tailored suits			1
" sometimes i just get sick of myself , " he confided , alluding to his time away from the spotlight			2
" that 's kind of what happened in 2001			1
i did n't want to see another photo ; i did n't want to hear me			2
i just sort of needed a coffee bean in the perfume shop of who i was , you know what i mean ? " but the deluge of media attention is starting to happen all over again			2
we 're backstage at " the @entity29 " in @entity30 , @entity1 , where the mood is jubilant			0
the night before , the 36 - year - old singer - songwriter earned six @entity34 nominations for " @entity35 , " the first in a trilogy of albums rolling out over the next couple of years			1
it 's the comeback story of 2009 , especially since @entity42 's much - publicized cd failed to garner a single nod from @entity34 voters			1
interview requests are pouring in			0
this time , @entity4 insists that he wo n't lose focus			1
" i think i was just more afraid			0
fear of failing , fear of having something sort of stop			0
for me , i was like , ' i do n't want to love this too much , because what if this goes away ? ' i kind of went through that because i 'm kind of insecure in that way			0
but for the hiatus to have occurred , to then come back and to have this -- i feel a lot more settled and a lot more confident			1
" @entity4 spoke with @entity2 about his return			1
@entity2 : when you were on your hiatus , was there ever a point where you thought , " i 'm not sure i 'm coming back ? " @entity4 : i did n't know			1
i did n't know what people would want of me , if they wanted me back at all			0
i was always working on some songs			0
but was there an industry that was ready for me ? @entity2 : back then , it was all about hip - hop excess and bling			1
@entity4 : it was so different three years ago , when you think about how hip - hop had completely devoured soul music or @entity79			1
the pendulum swings this way , and it swings that way , and i was waiting			0
i was biding my time because i was like , " why swim upstream ? " @entity2 : do you think your career would be where it is now had you not gone away for seven or eight years ? @entity4 : i do n't think so			1
i think that the person that always shows up to the party is the person that always shows up to the party			0
she 's lived a very interesting code with regards to how she deals with her career			1
she 's been gone for 10 years , and it 's a good feeling when you can walk back into it after not seeing a friend for so long , and then you sit down to have lunch or coffee or whatever , and it 's almost like time did not freeze			2
that is what i would love to have with the public -- is to be able to kind of go away and to come back , and it 's as if no time had passed between us			2
@entity2 : while you were away , it was easy to think you were gone because of something troublesome			0
@entity4 : when there 's no information , people create whatever they want			1
@entity2 : you 're very mysterious			0
@entity4 : am i ? @entity2 : people do n't know a whole lot about your life , except for what you write in lyrics			1
@entity4 : i feel like there 's a healthy separation , and i think that it really helps me to have something to say and to not make a spectacle of my day - to - day			1
i 'm not big on reality shows , when they know what toothbrush you use and what soap ; all those things that are commonplace now in terms of how people sort of see celebrities			2
i feel like i 'm real old - school that way			2
i love people like @entity144			0
he 'll make his movies , and then he 'll go do his thing , and i think people just leave him to himself			0
i 've seen celebrities -- and i 'm talking about big - time people -- literally get off a plane , grab their own luggage , rent a car and drive themselves home			1
i love the fact that i do n't always have to be " on " for my friends			0
and then when it 's time to get on stage , it 's that other person that kind of comes into the formation			2
i like those two distinctive worlds			0
@entity2 : sounds like kind of a " @entity167 " mentality , where you have your alter ego			0
@entity4 : i was thinking of @entity168 more -- just on a gender level			1
i do n't think i could rock those heels @entity171 rocks			0
( @entity173 ) @entity2 : are you ever going to grow your hair back ? @entity4 : you never know			1
i might do something else			0
i just go with the flow			0
i definitely do n't want to be a haircut , definitely do n't want to be a gimmick			0
@entity2 : but the new haircut kind of signified a new @entity4			1
@entity4 : it was just easier to deal with life in the morning , to be honest with you			1
you probably would have been waiting here like two , three more hours if it was the old strand and bead -- no , i 'm just playing			0
i feel like it 's also a rite of passage			2
you get older and grow , and you should change , you know ? if you 're frozen in a time capsule , that 's something you should be worried about			2
there are people who do what they do -- they have their superhero outfit , and they keep it on for 20 , 30 years			0
for me , it 's about transformation .			2
