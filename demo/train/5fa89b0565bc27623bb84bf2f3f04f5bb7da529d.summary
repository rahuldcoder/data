ambassador @entity26 and three other @entity3 were killed in the armed assault that , in part , focused attention on @entity31 security readiness and military response			2
the security step also follows a @entity31 travel advisory on wednesday about potential terror threats in @entity36 from @entity37 and affiliated groups following the @entity40 attack and standoff that killed 67 people			1
due to security concerns , the officials would not discuss the precise number of @entity2 added to the embassy since the shopping mall attack			1

was ' @entity81 ' involved in mall attack ? @entity11 authorities have said the attackers were from a number of countries , but have not confirmed that any @entity3 were involved			1
" we do n't have verifiable information that would indicate one way or the other way whether any @entity3 were involved , " @entity67 said			0
" that is one of the things that we are trying to do with our @entity11 colleagues - go through the forensic things , materials that we have , physical things to make that kind of determination			0

@entity3 forensic investigators were granted access to mall alongside @entity11 officials on thursday , @entity1 's @entity116 reported			1
but @entity3 law enforcement officials told @entity116 that there is an increasing concern that some of the perpetrators escaped alongside fleeing victims , making the effort to piece together who was responsible more difficult			1
the updated @entity31 travel caution on security threats and terror activities worldwide included the @entity11 attack , saying @entity78 had " taken credit " for it			1
" @entity78 assassinations , suicide bombings , hostage taking , and indiscriminate attacks in civilian - populated areas are also frequent in @entity79 , " the advisory said			0
@entity67 added that there was no " specific , credible evidence " that @entity78 is planning anything domestically			0
" i am not sure they have the capacity to do anything in the @entity3 , " he said , adding that the @entity3 is taking the " threat that they pose " seriously			0
a @entity3 official with access to the latest intelligence told @entity1 the @entity31 advisory was issued out of an " abundance of caution			1
" but officials are concerned there could be other plots in the works			0
