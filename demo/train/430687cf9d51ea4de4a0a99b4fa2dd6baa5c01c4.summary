we all hope the apparent cease - fire between @entity2 and @entity3 will hold			1
however , we must recognize that @entity3 and its terrorist partners bear responsibility for instigating the latest round of this conflict and need to refrain from further rocket and terrorist attacks			0
@entity2 exercised its inherent right to self - defense only after weeks of unprovoked attacks against civilian targets			1
having picked a fight like a playground bully , @entity3 can not now credibly claim to be a victim			0
@entity2 , like the @entity17 , places a premium on avoiding collateral damage and has spent hundreds of millions of dollars on sophisticated weaponry to minimize to the greatest extent possible civilian casualties			2
@entity3 intentionally launches unguided rockets into densely populated areas to cause wanton destruction and kill as many innocents as possible			1
@entity3 exploits their own citizens as human shields , locating rocket stockpiles in population centers , hopeful that images of dead @entity33 will rally the world to their extremist cause			0
it is important to understand how this conflict started and how responsibly @entity2 has behaved , but also how future conflicts with @entity3 can be prevented			2
@entity2 has made tremendous progress in reducing @entity3 ' capacity to threaten @entity2 and in restoring its deterrence			2
@entity2 's military operations in @entity43 have been informed by impressively accurate intelligence and have been conducted with great precision and success			1
significant stocks of long - range rockets have been destroyed , although remaining weapons stockpiles -- located in densely populated areas -- may require risky ground operations to secure should @entity3 resume firing at @entity2			1
for any enduring cease - fire , the onus must be on @entity3 to control its fighters , cease rocket attacks , abandon terrorism and accept @entity2 's right to exist -- conditions it has long refused to accept despite @entity2 's commitment to a two - state solution and persistent willingness to negotiate with its @entity33 neighbors			1
after @entity2 - @entity43 : who won , who lost ? @entity2 's @entity65 neighbors have an important role to play			1
@entity67 deserves credit for its efforts to craft a cease - fire , but initial inflammatory public statements and actions of its leaders unfortunately served mainly to legitimize @entity3			1
if @entity67 is serious about playing a positive role in the region , it will redouble its efforts to combat terrorist activities in the @entity78 , police its border with @entity43 , and prevent @entity80 and others from resupplying @entity3 with rockets and other weapons			0
if @entity3 rearms , it will be only a matter of time before the cease - fire breaks down			1
opinion : in @entity2 - @entity3 clash , @entity80 casts a shadow despite president @entity92 's friendship with @entity94 prime minister @entity93 , his recent behavior has been incredibly disappointing			1
@entity93 , not for the first time , this week referred to @entity2 as a ' terrorist state ' and has solely blamed @entity2 for the conflict , despite @entity3 ' preceding campaign of terror			2
@entity93 's anti-israel positions are well known , but his inability to see in @entity3 ' behavior any wrongdoing whatsoever is deeply disturbing			0
@entity94 and @entity2 for many years had a positive relationship			2
their shared interests and democratic values should overcome the obstacles of @entity93 's personal views and provocative statements			0
@entity2 look fondly upon @entity94 and its people , and they desire a better relationship with this important @entity114 country			2
@entity94 can play an important role in the region , as it has done in @entity117 , but its ability to be a responsible partner is badly hindered by @entity93 's staunch defense of a terrorist group			0
opinion : @entity2 , face new reality : talk to @entity3 the behavior of @entity125 is similarly disappointing			1
@entity125 's emir recently visited @entity43 and promised $ 400 million in aid to the terrorist rump - state , and it 's no coincidence that @entity3 ' escalation took place in the wake of the emir 's visit and his promise of cold hard cash			1
such efforts from @entity125 , @entity67 and @entity94 not only legitimize @entity3 ' violent strategy and embolden its militant leaders , but also marginalize the official @entity141 government of president @entity142 and prime minister @entity143			1
@entity3 ' influence and ability to threaten @entity2 militarily is greatly enhanced by the @entity80			2
long a patron of @entity3 , @entity80 provides significant resources and weapons to @entity3 and other terrorists in @entity43			0
indeed , the longer - range rockets fired at @entity151 and @entity152 are gifts of @entity154 , provided for use against the jewish state			0
any enduring solution must consider the pressing need to cut @entity80 's military supply lines to terrorists in @entity43			0
the conflict in @entity43 -- as well as the one in @entity117 -- demonstrates that the threat posed by @entity80 goes well beyond its pursuit of nuclear weapons			0
indeed , the most pressing challenge for @entity92 in his second term may be the dual task of thwarting @entity80 's push for nuclear weapons and combating its support for terrorism			0
news : @entity43 conflict leaves a ' cruel paradox ' for @entity33 the international community and especially the neighboring @entity65 and @entity177 states , if they truly care for the @entity33 , should make clear that terrorism will never earn the @entity33 statehood and encourage all @entity33 parties to return to the negotiating table to seek a peaceful solution to this decades - long conflict			0
follow @ @entity184 on twitter			0

@entity187 : there 's a difference between the actions of @entity3 and @entity2
he says @entity3 fires rockets *indiscriminately* into civilian areas ; @entity2 defends itself
@entity187 : support from @entity94 and @entity125 encourages @entity3 ' *aggression*
he says for cease - fire to last , @entity3 must stop terrorism , accept @entity2 's right to exist
