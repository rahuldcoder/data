-- deep down on the bottom of the @entity4 , @entity2 treasure hunters think they have made the find of a lifetime			1
the problem is , they 're not exactly sure what it is they 've uncovered			0
out searching for shipwrecks at a secret location between @entity2 and @entity15 , the deep - sea salvage company @entity12 captured an incredible image more than 80 meters below the water 's surface			1
at first glance , team leader and commercial diver @entity19 joked that his crew had just discovered an unidentified flying object , or @entity24			1
" i have been doing this for nearly 20 years so i have a seen a few objects on the bottom , but nothing like this , " said @entity19			1
" we had been out for nine days and we were quite tired and we were on our way home , but we made a final run with a sonar fish and suddenly this thing turned up , " he continued			2
using side - scan sonar , the team found a 60 - meter diameter cylinder - shaped object , with a rigid tail 400 meters long			1
the imaging technique involves pulling a sonar " towfish " -- that essentially looks sideways underwater - behind a boat , where it creates sound echoes to map the sea floor below			1
on another pass over the object , the sonar showed a second disc - like shape 200 meters away			1

" we 've heard lots of different kinds of explanations , from @entity69 's spaceship -- the @entity70 -- to ' it 's some kind of plug to the inner world , ' like it should be hell down there or something			2
" but we wo n't know until we have been down there , " said @entity19			0
@entity78 at @entity2 's @entity79 , @entity80 , admits he 's intrigued by the picture , but remains sceptical about what it could be			1
the reliability of one - side scan sonar images is one of his main concerns , making it difficult to determine if the object is a natural geological formation or something different altogether			1
" it all depends on the circumstances when you actually tow the [ sonar ] fish after the boat , " he said			2

even @entity19 agrees the image " is n't the best it could be			0
" but his crew are still planning to return to the site in the calmer waters of spring to investigate their find			0
it 's a risky and expensive business , and not one that always pays off			2
@entity124 maritime historian , professor @entity123 , says the costs of recovery are now too high for most			0
" if you want to stand in a cold shower tearing up Â £ 50 notes , go shipwreck hunting , " he said			0
" most shipwrecks are rotting away , or carrying dull things -- all the romance has been taken out of it			2
" it 's a problem @entity19 and his team are aware of			2
" it 's a very difficult industry to be in -- it 's money all the time , " he confessed			0
" the best thing it could be , would be 60 meters of gold -- then i would be very happy			0
" " this thing is very far out , it 's really off - shore , so first of all we need a bigger ship ... more equipment			1
. and we have to do bottom sampling , water sampling , to see if it is something poisonous			0
" but even if the mystery object does n't contain retrievable treasure the site could still prove to be a gold mine for the @entity12 team , with tourists and private investors paying to see it up - close , in a submarine			1

in the @entity166 , one @entity165 salvage company is also hoping to beat the odds			1
@entity168 -- a company made up of researchers , scientists , technicians and archaeologists -- have at least 6,300 shipwrecks in their database that they are looking to find			1
their latest discoveries include two @entity124 war - time shipwrecks off the coast of @entity179 that could be laden with hundreds of tonnes of silver			1
@entity182 , president of @entity168 , says at least 100 ships on their watch - list are known to have values in excess of $ 50 million dollars			0
" when you think about the fact until the mid 20th century , the only way to transport wealth was on the oceans and a lot of ships were lost , it adds up to a formula where we have billions of dollars worth of interesting and valuable things on the sea floor , " he said			0
the lure of treasure has lead to an increasing number of discoveries in recent years			0
but one which does n't come without its dangers , warns @entity80			0
" i think recently we 're entering a time of a lot of discoveries , " he said of the technological advancements in finding shipwrecks			0
" the professional shipwreck discoverers are doing a great effort for cultural heritage management in the long run ... what we do n't support is the action of actually taking up items and selling them , " he said .			0
