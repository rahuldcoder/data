-- the @entity2 judge presiding over @entity4 's murder trial ruled monday that jurors will be allowed to hear about marijuana found in @entity8 's system the night he was fatally shot			1
prosecutors argued the amount was so minimal that " we just do n't know " what effect it had on @entity8			1
they also accused the defense of trying to " backdoor some very negative character evidence " into the trial			2
but the defense said the amount found in @entity8 's system would have affected his judgment that night and is therefore relevant to the case			1
judge @entity20 ruled she would allow the testimony about @entity8 's toxicology results in front of the jury and told the prosecutors they would be able to cross-examine the defense 's witness and present rebuttal witnesses of their own			1
@entity4 is charged with second - degree murder for killing 17 - year - old @entity8 in @entity31 , @entity2 , on february 26 , 2012			1
@entity4 told police he was pursuing the teenager because there had been a rash of crime in the area			2
a confrontation ensued , and @entity4 said he was forced to kill @entity8			1
protests were held around the country , calling for @entity4 's arrest in @entity8 's death			1
@entity4 was eventually charged with second - degree murder in april 2012			1
the case has reinvigorated national conversations about race , racial profiling and self - defense laws			2
@entity8 's father , @entity49 , took the stand on monday to describe what he heard in the background of a 911 call made by one of @entity4 's neighbor			1
" basically what i was listening to , i was listening to my son 's last cry for help			2
i was listening to his life being taken and i was trying to come to grips with that -- that @entity8 was here no more			2
it was just tough , " said @entity8			2
earlier in the day , the defense called the former lead investigator from the @entity66 , @entity65 , who said @entity8 told him " no , " under his breath , when asked if the voice belonged to his son			1
another investigator , @entity70 , also said there was no doubt @entity8 told them it was n't his son screaming for help on that 911 call			1
" he was very upset , he was very sad , he hung his head , he cried , " said @entity70			0
" i was choked up myself			0
i had to stand back			0
i could feel how he must feel because i have children			0
i was choked up by it -- i felt horrible for him			0
" but @entity8 testified that he never said it was n't his son			1
he said that he pushed his chair away from the desk where he was listening to the call and told investigators he " could n't tell			2
" the man who trained @entity4 how to fight also testified on monday that the former neighborhood watch captain did n't know how to throw a punch after training for almost a year			1
" he was -- and i do n't really like to use this terminology -- soft , just physically soft			0
he was an overweight , large man -- and a very pleasant , nice man -- but physically soft , " said @entity90			0
@entity4 started taking grappling classes where @entity90 said trainers teach choke holds , arm locks and leg locks to students -- " basically make the person say , ' @entity99 , ' " according to @entity90			2
after his school schedule changed , @entity4 moved on to boxing training , where he did n't advance beyond learning how to jab , according to @entity90			2
when asked what level @entity4 was at right before the shooting , @entity90 said , " he 's still learning how to punch			2
he did n't really know how to effectively punch			0
" " did he ever get to the point where he could box somebody else ? " asked defense attorney @entity105			0
" absolutely not , " said @entity90			0
at one point during his testimony , @entity90 stepped down from the witness stand to mount defense attorney @entity105 , who lay on the ground			0
@entity105 wanted @entity90 to show what the technique " ground and pound " looks like			0
a witness who saw the fight between @entity4 and @entity8 testified earlier in the trial that it looked like a " ground and pound " and that @entity4 was on the bottom			1
@entity90 showed how the person on top usually has the advantage in this position , which is associated with mixed martial arts fighting			0
@entity90 demonstrated how his knees would be placed above the person 's waist and explained how gravity helps the person on top punch the person on the bottom			0
in a continued effort to show @entity4 was not the aggressor in the altercation , the defense also called a slew of his friends on monday to identify the voice heard screaming in the background of the 911 call made by a neighbor			1
@entity144 , a former @entity145 combat medic , grew emotional on the stand in the @entity4 trial monday as he explained why he thought the screams for help heard on a 911 call made the night @entity8 died were made by his friend , @entity4			1
@entity144 was just one of a group of defense witnesses who testified on the trial 's 10th day about the controversial 911 call , which has become a key point of contention in the case			1
choking back tears , @entity144 explained that the reason he could identify the screams is because of his experience with the fog of war			0
during combat , @entity144 had to recognize the screams of his fellow soldiers and run to them when they needed help			0
he said he has heard a 250 - pound man scream like a little girl			0
" in the midst of combat , there are a lot people yelling and screaming , " said @entity144			0
" sometimes they are screaming for help			0
" @entity144 told the court that he views @entity4 as a " son , " but his close relationship with @entity4 would not affect his testimony			2
@entity144 donated almost $ 3,000 to @entity4 's defense fund and spent $ 1,700 on suits for @entity4 to wear during the trial			1
@entity144 's testimony monday was preceded by that of four of @entity4 's other friends , who all said that they also recognized the screams on the 911 call as @entity4 's voice			1
during cross-examination , prosecutors focused on potential bias -- due to their close relationships with the defendant -- on the part of the witnesses			0
the defense team told @entity196 that it expects to introduce @entity8 's toxicology reports sometime on tuesday			1
testimony is expected to resume at 9 a.m. et.			0
