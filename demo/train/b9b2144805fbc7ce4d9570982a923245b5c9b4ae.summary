-- the financial world is in an uproar about the @entity4 opinion piece by @entity5 , a former vice president in @entity7 ' equity derivatives business			1
as a former vice president in @entity7 ' equity derivatives business who also made it into @entity12 when i quit , i ca n't help but feel a bit upstaged			1
part of my resentment comes from the fact that @entity5 is being touted as a high - level defector from the notoriously secretive ranks of @entity7			1
but calling @entity5 a senior @entity7 executive , as many media outlets do , misunderstands the nature of titles at investment banks			1
@entity5 was an " executive director and head of the firm 's @entity26 equity derivatives business in @entity28 , the @entity29 and @entity30 , " which certainly sounds fancy			1
but , as the firm took pains to point out in response to the article , there are 12,000 employees with the title of " vice president " ( in the @entity26 ) or its international equivalent , " executive director			0
" as for being head of that particular business , well , pretty much everyone at any investment bank is the head of some business or another			0
clients prefer to deal with the head of a business , so senior bankers are practiced in introducing even their most junior colleagues as the head of something or other			0
my own semi-official titles -- among others , " vice president and head of the equity derivatives business for the @entity61 energy industry " -- were as impressive as @entity5 's , but what i rarely mentioned was that that business consisted of me and one junior analyst			1
@entity5 's business lacked even the analyst ! more important , though , it is a mistake to read @entity5 's piece as a scandalous revelation of the decline of @entity72 culture			1
@entity7 exec quits , calling firm ' toxic ' yes , there was once a time when big investment banks made most of their money by advising clients on mergers and capital raising , rather than by trading with clients			1
and yes , those times are long gone			0
but they were long gone when @entity5 started			2
and he was in the derivatives sales business , which has always and necessarily been a business in which @entity7 is on one side of a trade and its clients -- or , in the more neutral term popular in such businesses , " customers " -- are on the other			2
each dollar that @entity7 makes comes directly out of its client 's pockets			1
of course , @entity5 's clients , who included some of the largest hedge funds and asset managers in the world , knew this			1
they did not come to @entity5 for impartial advice about their personal and professional problems			2
rather they came to him to execute trades at attractive prices and for trade ideas , ideas that they hoped would make them money but that they certainly expected would make @entity7 money			2
thus , worries that clients will flee @entity7 are overblown			2
@entity7 's clients know that the firm is trying to make money off of them -- and they know that every other bank is trying to do the exact same thing			1
they are not looking for charity			0
they are looking for good ideas and good execution , and the bank that provides those benefits will continue to get business			0
one question on everyone 's mind is : why now ? march is a customary time to quit , since @entity5 's 2011 bonus check will have cleared , but why did it take him 12 years to figure out that @entity7 's culture was rotten ? after all , @entity129 and the @entity130 have been saying similar things for years			1
one possible answer is that @entity5 is part of a broader exodus			2
the past year has seen many departures by @entity7 partners , including @entity5 's boss ' boss ' boss ' bosses , @entity137 and @entity141			1
those career traders are unlikely to have left because they felt sad for clients			0
instead , the widespread speculation is that they left because the money is n't good enough			0
average pay at @entity7 was down 15 % in 2011 , albeit to a still - healthy $ 367,000 per employee			1
stricter regulations on proprietary trading and higher capital requirements will probably reduce profitability -- and pay -- for years to come			0
investment banking and trading are difficult businesses ; bankers work long hours , travel frequently and are under intense pressure			2
@entity5 is hardly the first banker to worry about whether his work makes the world a better place			2
working at an investment bank involves trading off those negatives -- stress , hours and a nagging sense of unfulfilled purpose -- against the positive aspects of the job , which can be loosely summarized as " huge paychecks			0
" when that balance changes , a good trader re-evaluates his position			0
expect to see more departures from @entity7 and its peer firms in the coming months			0
but do n't take too seriously the idea that they 're leaving because they 're sick of making money off of clients			0
more likely , they 're leaving because they 're sick of not making as much money off of clients as they used to			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			0

@entity5 , former @entity7 employee , *writes* in @entity4 that he quits
@entity187 : media outlets misunderstand the nature of titles at investment banks
he says it is a mistake to read @entity5 's piece as a revelation of the decline of @entity72 culture
@entity187 : if more bankers leave , it 's probably because they 're not making as much as before
