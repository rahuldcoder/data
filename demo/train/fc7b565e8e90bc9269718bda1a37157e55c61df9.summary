-- @entity1 will seek to upstage two of his most illustrious golfing compatriots and win his first professional tournament at the @entity5 on sunday			1
the 37 - year - old goes into the final round tied for the lead with 2010 @entity10 champion @entity9 and one shot ahead of two - time @entity13 winner @entity12 after carding a superb eight - under - par 65 in @entity14 on saturday			1
@entity15 der @entity1 , who finished second in a 2005 @entity18 @entity17 event , eliminated @entity9 's two - shot overnight lead as he started with four successive birdies and -- like his fellow @entity21 -- picked up a shot at the final hole			1
the world no. 347 's only blemish at his home event came at the par - four eighth hole , and he was confident he could contend for his first title since turning pro in 1996 in the opening event of the 2012 @entity32 season			1
" at the end of the day , the golf ball does n't know that they are major champions , " he said of his rivals			0
" i 've played at the highest level , i 've never won majors or big events , so who knows what can happen			0
" i do feel as if i am controlling the golf ball as well as i have in a long time			0
not just tee to green , but on the greens as well			0
and that 's a good sign for me			0
i 'm entitled to forget the one bad shot i hit all day			0
" defending champion @entity9 's only lapse came at the par - five 11th hole as he took four shots to reach the green			1
" it was an elementary mistake really			0
those little chip - outs seem easy , and i made the basic error of leaving it short of a tree for my approach to the green , " the world no. 40 said			2
@entity12 , seeking his first @entity32 win for five years , carded a flawless 66 to be on 20 - under 199			1

@entity99 winner @entity98 was sixth after a 69 , while veteran @entity100 carded 70			0
