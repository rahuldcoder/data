-- by now , you 've likely seen the shocking video -- professional football player @entity3 punching his future wife out cold in an @entity6 casino elevator and dragging her limp body out			1
there 's been so much to this saga , much of it developing very quickly every day this week			0
the latest is that the @entity11 has hired former @entity13 director @entity12 to lead an investigation into how the league handled the case involving the @entity18 ' running back			1
we have to say former because @entity3 was fired this week			1
in this important story involving arguably @entity23 's most treasured sport , who said what when ? who knew what when ? and where is this all going ? @entity0 breaks it down			0
can you explain this from the beginning ? this timeline is a great place to start to learn how far back this elevator incident goes -- it happened early in the morning on february 15 -- and the twists and turns continued until this past monday when @entity36 published a bombshell surveillance tape that revealed what happened inside the elevator			0
until monday , @entity3 's punishment was a two - game suspension , a fine and an agreement to attend a rehabilitation program that some legal experts say could have cleared him of a third - degree aggravated assault charge if he met certain requirements			1
the @entity36 tape hit and then what ? on september 8 , @entity36 published surveillance footage that showed @entity3 punching @entity52			1
the couple married a little more than a month after the february elevator incident			0
when @entity36 posted the tape on its website , @entity3 was about two weeks away from rejoining the @entity18 on the field			2
but after @entity36 's monday reporting , the situation changed for the ball player			0
@entity3 was released from his contract			2
both he and @entity11 commissioner @entity64 faced incredible criticism			1
current and former players and sports world insiders demanded to know if the league had asked for the tape and questioned how @entity64 handled the whole matter			2
see some of those angered after seeing the @entity36 tape what did the @entity11 commissioner say after @entity36 published the video ? on september 9 , @entity64 talked to @entity76			1
he said that no one in the @entity11 had seen the tape @entity36 published showing what happened inside the elevator			1
the @entity11 had only seen another video that showed the exterior of the elevator and @entity3 dragging @entity52 out of it			1
about that scene -- in which @entity3 is seen pulling his unconscious @entity86 out of the elevator , face - down -- @entity64 said , " it was ambiguous about what actually happened " inside the elevator			1
@entity76 's @entity91 asked : " but what was ambiguous about her laying unconscious on the floor being dragged out by her feet ? " " there was nothing ambiguous about that , " @entity64 replied			0
" that was the result that we saw			0
we did not know what led up to that			0
we did not know the details of that			0
" see the rest of the @entity76 interview @entity64 said no one at the league saw the videotape of @entity3 hitting his wife			2
why ? @entity64 told @entity76 that the @entity11 had requested all materials related to the case from law enforcement but did not receive anything			1
" on multiple occasions , we asked for it , " he said			0
" and on multiple occasions we were told no. " on tuesday , @entity11 spokesman @entity118 said that security for @entity6 casinos is handled by @entity121			2
" any videos related to an ongoing criminal investigation are held in the custody of the state police			0
as we said yesterday : we requested from law enforcement any and all information about the incident , including the video from inside the elevator			1
that video was not made available to us , " @entity118 said in a statement			0
reaction to @entity64 's handling of the @entity3 case was severe			2
some sports observers and current and former players blasted him for giving @entity3 too light a punishment with the two - game suspension , and others said they doubted @entity64 was being truthful that he 'd not seen the tape showing what happened inside the elevator			1
several questioned if he had really pushed hard enough to get it			0
@entity76 asked @entity64 if he thought his job was on the line			0
he said no. what is this about a news report contradicting @entity64 's claims ? on wednesday , the @entity152 , citing an unnamed law enforcement source , reported that the video showing the violence inside the elevator was actually given to the @entity11 five months ago			1
the law enforcement official told the @entity152 that in early april , he sent the video to an @entity11 executive			1
the official played a 12 - second voicemail recorded april 9 from an @entity11 office number , the @entity152 reported , in which a female voice confirmed that the video had been received			1
according to the @entity152 , she expressed thanks and said , " you 're right			2
" how is the former director of the @entity13 involved ? on wednesday , the @entity11 said that @entity12 , the @entity13 chief from 2001 to 2013 , will have access to all @entity11 records			2
according to league spokesman @entity170 , two @entity11 owners who are attorneys -- @entity172 of the @entity173 and @entity174 of the @entity175 -- will oversee the investigation			2
" many of us were dissatisfied with the original two - game suspension of @entity3 , " @entity177 said in a statement wednesday			1
@entity64 " took responsibility for that in his august 28th memo to the owners when he stated , ' i did n't get it right			0
simply put , we have to do better			0
' he then took appropriate steps to address this matter			0
" the @entity11 's policy on domestic violence " has been strengthened , " he said , saying that the league has a " strong partnership with anti-domestic violence groups , " and will " be a better league for it going forward			2
" @entity177 was referring to a change in policy that @entity64 made recently that any @entity11 employees -- not just players -- who are determined to have committed battery , assault , domestic violence or sexual assault would be suspended without pay for six games for a first offense			1
second - time offenders would be banned from the league for at least a year			0
" my understanding is that the @entity208 and the @entity18 made repeated requests to obtain the video of the @entity3 incident and were denied each time , " @entity177 's statement continued			1
" the notion that the @entity208 should have gone around law enforcement to obtain the video is , in my opinion , misguided , as is the notion that the commissioner 's job is now in jeopardy			1
the video is appalling , and i believe that the team and the @entity208 took appropriate action after they finally had the opportunity to view it			0
" there is no place for domestic violence in our sport or in our society , " he said , " and we are committed to doing our part to prevent such heinous acts going forward			0
" how are people reacting now ? " @entity235 " and " @entity236 " are trending on @entity234 thursday			0
some current and former @entity11 players blasted @entity64 on social media			1
the commissioner " should be held accountable for his lack of action just like @entity3 has finally been held accountable for his actions , " free agent and former @entity241 linebacker @entity240 tweeted wednesday			1
the same night , @entity246 free safety @entity247 tweeted : " as a husband , father and player i 'm embarrassed to be associated with the @entity11 right now ! " " @entity252 should demand that @entity3 be banned from the @entity11			1
i 'd be damned if i had to be associated w / him [ @entity3 ] , " tweeted nine - year @entity11 veteran @entity253			1
some feel there needs to be a broader examination of how the @entity11 handles allegations of domestic violence			2
an opinion piece thursday by @entity0 legal analyst @entity260 brings up other cases and demands that @entity64 lose his job			0
the @entity263 , a longtime advocacy organization for women 's rights , dismissed @entity12 's appointment as " just window dressing , " and was leading its web site thursday with # @entity236			0
in other football circles , @entity269 owner @entity268 admitted he did n't handle the @entity3 situation properly			2
he said he did n't see the video from inside the elevator and made false assumptions about what happened .			0
