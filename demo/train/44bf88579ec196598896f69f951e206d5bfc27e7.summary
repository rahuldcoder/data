-- i watched the steady hand of my first officer , @entity3 , advance the thrust levers of our @entity5			2
with the assistance of 115,000 ponds of thrust from each of two @entity13 engines , the airplane began its lumbered roll down the center line of @entity16 at @entity17			0
we accelerated toward a rotation speed of 153 knots			0
at rotation speed , @entity3 applied gentle pressure to the control yoke , lifting the nose of our 602,000 - pound airplane skyward			1
this would be one of the most critical phases of our flight to @entity29			0
the immediate threat at that moment was the possibility that one of the @entity13 engines would fail or tear itself apart internally at the most vulnerable time , an event we 'd practiced for repeatedly on flight simulators -- an event controllable through mechanical design and good old fashioned pilot skills			0
as airline pilots , this is one of the many eventualities we prepare for on every trip			1
as a result of september 11 , we also prepare for terrorism			1
and now it appears that we will be adding missile evasion to the list			1
it is almost inconceivable that tragedy would strike the same struggling airline twice in such a short period , but the truth speaks for itself			0
from over 800 flights traversing @entity61 airspace during the week before the crash of @entity58 17 it was the only airplane targeted by a missile			1
the crews aboard the four ill - fated flights on september 11 all had one expectation at the end of their trip assignments			0
they would come home to their loved ones , kiss their wife or husband , pet the dog , and listen to their children talk about the day at school			0
this was the expectation of the crew aboard @entity58 fight 370 last march , and the crew of @entity58 17 last week			1
none of these crews went to work with the expectation that they had the potential to be casualties of war , nor did their passengers			0
for a relatively small air carrier it is the equivalent of losing family members , an emotionally devastating event			1
and like most airline crews , those at @entity93 will continue to serve at their professional best despite the circumstances			0
they must do this while defending themselves against criticism that the airline or the pilots could have prevented the catastrophe had they taken a different route than the one through @entity61 airspace			1
this begins the blame game and is a typical reaction to an unimaginable event , especially an airplane crash with such large loss of life			0
but the fact of the matter is that the route is assigned by air traffic control , as it is by air traffic control systems all over the world			1
the flight crew was simply complying with that clearance			1
pilots do n't have the authority to change an assigned route on their own unless an emergency takes precedence			1
and even in an emergency certain guidelines must be followed			0
as an example , on the @entity130 track system , which defines the routes between @entity132 and @entity133 , the requirement to offset from an assigned route by 15 miles in an emergency is crucial to preventing conflict with other traffic			1
as for the airline dispatchers , they are responsible for filing route requests that serve the airline safely , comfortably and economically			2
but they have to plan their flights within the confines of air traffic control guidelines and restrictions and may not have many choices in certain areas other than to select a given altitude			1
if the dispatcher is aware of restrictions , the requested route that he or she files will reflect that			2
in the case of @entity160 , and with many other airlines transiting the @entity163 region of @entity164 where @entity160 was downed , such safety restrictions had caused the plane to fly at a higher - than - usual altitude : 33,000 feet ( @entity164 officials had raised the minimum altitude requirement to 32,000 feet )			1
@entity170 relative : @entity171 through love , not revenge in the @entity175 , airspace is blotted all over the country with restricted areas that are primarily for military use			0
routes filed by civilian airplanes have to avoid these areas			2
pilots do not stray into restricted airspace without air traffic control permission			1
some of these areas are " hot " continuously and others are hot only at certain times , and at certain altitudes			0
yes , if it is determined that a war zone on the ground could pose a threat , an option is to use a route that circumnavigates the airspace			2
but the war zone overflown by @entity160 was never considered a definitive threat to civilian airplanes			1
threat information is only as good as the intelligence supplied by air traffic control and its cooperating governments			1
so how is a missile attack thwarted on an airliner ? the answer , unfortunately , is not very well			2
in 2003 , an event reported in the back page of the newspapers involved a @entity209 that was struck by a surface - to - air @entity211 missile just after departure from the @entity214			1
ironically , the crew was executing a rapid climb maneuver to limit their exposure to just such an occurrence			2
the left wing sustained serious damage			0
all three hydraulic systems lost pressure because of a rapid fluid leak			0
the loss of hydraulic fluid also meant the loss of pressure to the primary flight controls			0
through the innovative piloting skills of the three - man crew , the airplane completed a successful landing by using differential power			2
the @entity234 @entity233 was fortunate to have encountered a missile of limited capabilities			2
if the reported circumstances of @entity160 's crash are accurate , for an airliner to have evaded a high - speed radar - guided missile would have been beyond its maneuvering capacity			1
years back , when the @entity211 ( stands for man - portable air defense system ) threat was becoming a major topic of discussion as the next terrorist scenario , my airline considered installation of an automatic missile warning and detection system			1
with @entity254 approval , through a company that designed such things , three of our @entity257 's were outfitted with the system			0
to use a bad pun , it never got off the ground			0
cost , of course , was an issue			0
and from a practical standpoint , being alerted to a missile was a great tool , but an airliner 's inability to quickly maneuver away from the danger still made the outcome inevitable			1
and with warfare technology becoming more sophisticated and deadly , an airline missile detection system may have been outdated on the day it was installed			1
ultimately the truth surrounding the fate of @entity277 must be determined , lest we jump to inaccurate conclusions			0
the destruction of @entity281 in 1983 is just such an example			0
although indeed a @entity285 fighter jet fired upon the @entity286 , it was later determined that the pilots had allowed the airplane to drift into @entity290 airspace by not selecting the appropriate navigational mode on the autopilot			2
the airspace involved was an area that @entity175 airplanes , ( some of them military versions of airliners like the 707 ) traversed nearby to toy with the @entity285			2
the role of professional accident investigation is to find the cause of such tragedies regardless of their origin			0
we can only hope that the investigation is not further impeded by extraneous situations .			0

@entity310 : pilots prepare for emergencies . @entity313 added terror , @entity160 added missile evasion
some say plane could have avoided region , but he says crew followed air traffic control
he says pilots ca n't just change route , they follow regulations . plane already at higher altitude
@entity329 : airplanes not able to dodge missiles . such technology would be quickly *obsolete*
