@entity1 , @entity0 -- despite the rain , " @entity7 " shone brightly at the @entity4 sunday , scooping a clutch of honors			1
" @entity7 " director @entity8 shields composer @entity9 from the rain as they arrive sunday at the @entity13 awards in @entity1			1
not even the drizzle could dampen @entity8 's spirits as " @entity7 , " his @entity15 - set rags to riches movie phenomenon won a remarkable seven awards at the glitziest night in the @entity20 film calendar			1
" you make a film like this and you just hope and pray it will be seen by a few people , " the @entity20 director told @entity2			1
" and the journey it 's been on , the reception it 's had around the world , has just been extraordinary			0
" watch @entity8 , @entity30 and @entity31 talking about " slumdog " on the red carpet			0
as was widely expected , following its haul of four @entity36 last month including @entity37 , " @entity7 " took the @entity39 award			1
" i 'd like to acknowledge the blood , sweat and tears of our cast , " said the film 's producer , @entity40 who accepted the award			2
" the film you saw is the film @entity8 imagined and it 's very rare you can say that			2
he dreamed the dream , 24 - hours a day , seven days a week for two and a half years			0
" @entity8 's labors were recognized by the @entity53 , handing him the @entity55 award , which he can add to the @entity13 he won for debut feature " @entity57 " in 1995			0
" @entity7 " has touched audiences and critics alike			1
@entity8 thinks the film 's extraordinary effect is down to its universal message of hope			2
" it 's the contrast i think between where the kid comes from and what he achieves , " said @entity8			0
" and he achieves everything on his own terms , and that gives you a kind of hope , really , which we all , no matter how romantic it is , we all need that			0
" watch @entity77 legend and " @entity7 " star @entity78 talking about the " @entity7 " phenomenon			1
" @entity7 " also won the @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity85 awards			1
closest rival @entity87 's " @entity86 , " which was up for 11 awards , bagged only three			0
these included a richly - deserved @entity91 for the feat of transforming @entity93 into an octogenarian baby to tell the curious story of a man who is born old and gets younger as he ages			0
actress @entity98 also continued her success streak , scoring the leading actress honor for her powerful portrayal of a former - @entity103 concentration camp guard in @entity105 's " the reader			1
" conversely , @entity98 both won and lost the award having been nominated twice in the same category , which included @entity108 for " @entity109 , " and @entity110 for " @entity111			1
" but most eyes were on the actress to see if there would be a repeat performance of the breathlessly incoherent acceptance speech she made at the @entity36 last month after winning two awards			1
" these are really special moments			0
and i do n't want to waste them , " @entity98 told @entity2 on the red carpet before going on to accept her award with no tears or obvious emotion			1
instead she simply thanked her parents and the late @entity126 and the @entity127 , two of the film 's producers			2
watch @entity98 talking about her " amazing year " on the red carpet			2
reformed @entity133 badboy @entity132 provided the only mild controversy of the night with a few expletives in his acceptance speech for the @entity138			2
" thank you @entity140 who gave me a second chance after i 'd f * * * ed up my career for 15 years			0
such a pleasure to be here , and be out of the darkness , " he told the audience			0
earlier , the actor told @entity2 how things have changed for him since the accolades started pouring in for his extraordinary performance in @entity140 's " @entity150			0
" " i got a whole bunchy of new friends that i do n't need , " @entity132 said			2
" but i 've also heard from some people that i 'd worked with years ago that i 'd burned bridges with that have come around			0
" it 's taken me a long time to change and come back and do things the right way			0
i 'm just grateful for the second chance			0
" there were also gongs for @entity161 's @entity160 , who took home supporting actress for her fiery scene - stealing performance as an unhinged artist in @entity168 's " @entity167 , " and the late @entity173 whose chilling reinvention of the @entity170 in @entity172 's " @entity171 " was recognized with the @entity175 award			1
now , as attention turns to the upcoming @entity53 , " @entity7 's " @entity13 wins will only increase the momentum behind the @entity37 nominee			1
after success at both the @entity36 and the @entity13 , @entity98 could also be justified in looking forward to the @entity53 with confidence .			2
