as i sat in dr. @entity3 's exam room at @entity4 in @entity5 , only one word raced through my mind : " whoa ! " that was it			1
i really could n't understand why this was happening to me -- and now			2
i had beaten obesity and , for the first time in my life , i was hitting the gym regularly and practicing portion control in my diet			2
i 'd taken up tennis and , in fact , was actually pretty decent			2
this is me we 're talking about -- someone who 'd never run for , hit or even caught a ball until i was 42			2
even though i felt and looked great , i was experiencing what i now know are the classic symptoms of heart disease : frequent intense heart palpitations , light - headedness , shortness of breath and extreme fatigue			1
but i always thought that heart disease was an old white dude 's disease			1
that 's what i 'd seen on television anyway			1
it did n't happen to newly skinny black women who had it going on			1
or , at least thought they had it going on			2
i could n't have been more wrong			0
i was about to be the face of heart disease			1
when my doctors told me they were going to crack my chest open and take my heart out of my body to repair my aortic valve and remove a subaortic membrane to stave off future heart issues , it scared the crap out of me ! i sincerely considered not having the surgery			1
but i knew i needed to be strong			0
so , i got focused			0
and yes , at times , i was terrified			0
anyone who goes through cardiac surgery and tells you they were n't scared is lying			0
fortunately , the skill level of my physicians and the resources that were available to me left me encouraged by the prognosis for recovery			0
amazingly , even though the doctors stopped my heart for 22 minutes on the operating table , i made it through open - heart surgery without any complications			2
as part of my recovery , i elected to do cardiac rehab			0
that was the second - best decision of my life			0
three months of pushing myself to the limit with steadfast determination to recover fully was my goal			0
the discipline necessary to strengthen your heart after surgery is relentless and exhausting but so worth it			2
no , more like blessed			0
i came through heart disease , and today i 'm a survivor			1
with my recovery , i realized i had an obligation that reached beyond my own health			0
i made a commitment to use whatever platform i have in the public eye to raise awareness of heart disease in women			1
according to the @entity91 and the @entity92 , heart disease is the no. 1 killer of all @entity94			1
it 's the no. 1 killer of african - americans , and it 's the no. 1 killer of women			1
so , you see , heart disease for me is personal -- very personal			1
for three years , i 've served as the @entity100 for the @entity91 and a volunteer spokeswoman for their @entity103 movement			0
the movement aims to dispel myths surrounding heart disease and raise awareness			1
it 's a passionate , emotional and social initiative designed to empower women to take charge of their heart health			1
the goal is to harness the energy , passion and power women have to band together and , collectively , wipe out our no. 1 killer			2
with @entity118 coming up this friday , i 'm reminded that bringing awareness to heart disease is n't about just wearing red one day a year			1
it 's about sharing your story and empowering each other to make heart health a priority starting now			1
i 'm thankful for the voice i have when it comes to fighting this preventable disease			1
i 've made it my mission to do what i know how to do -- talk -- to anyone who 'll listen to my story			0
and , believe me , i 've been coast to coast sharing my story and educating others along the way			0
today , i 'm living my best life in great health			0
i 'm so proud i 've spent the past 10 years getting myself in the best physical and emotional shape i could be in			0
i learned late in life that my health is my greatest asset and encouraging healthy living is my purpose in life			0
for she who has health has hope , and she who has hope has everything .			0
