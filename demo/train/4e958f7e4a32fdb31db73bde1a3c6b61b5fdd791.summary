@entity0 , a @entity1 double agent who says he worked with the @entity2 and @entity1 intelligence to track down @entity6 - born @entity5 cleric @entity4 , says the @entity1 intelligence agency @entity7 tried to buy his silence after he stopped working for them earlier this year			1
storm claims the @entity1 intelligence agency offered payments totaling 1.5m @entity13 ( $ 260,000 ) over a five - year period			1
he told the @entity1 newspaper @entity15 that @entity7 had offered him the money tax free , after the agency became aware that he was considering going public with his story			1
but he said he rejected the offer because @entity7 had broken a series of promises to him , including providing permanent residence status in @entity1 for his foreign wife			1
instead he told @entity15 his extraordinary story -- which spanned five years and several trips to @entity26 as a double agent -- as well as a close relationship with @entity2 officers , according to @entity10 's account			1
the revelations , backed up extensive corroborating evidence , have sent shock waves through @entity1 , and led to calls for greater oversight of the country 's intelligence services			1
@entity1 law prohibits the security services from being involved in assassinations			1
the @entity1 biker and the trail that led to @entity5 's most wanted " we have documented clearly that the @entity1 secret service took part in mission to locate @entity4 and that raises the question because , it was known at the time the @entity6 was ready to kill him if they had the chance , " @entity15 editor @entity44 told @entity45			1
the disclosure sunday by storm of the cash offer has heightened the political controversy in @entity1 , and led to allegations @entity1 authorities were trying to cover up illegal activity			1
storm had previously provided @entity15 an audio recording from this summer in which one of his @entity1 intelligence handlers appeared to hold out the possibility of payments			1
" what annoys me about is the way you treated me last year with @entity4 , " storm is heard saying on the recording			2
but that 's it , [ we 're ] trying to make up for [ it ] now , " his handler replied , according to @entity15			2
@entity7 director @entity78 two weeks ago said that his agency " did not contribute during the military operation that led to the killing of @entity4 in @entity26			2
" @entity7 and @entity2 have neither confirmed nor denied @entity10 worked for them			0
@entity7 has made no public comment on @entity10 's latest allegations			0
there is firm evidence that storm , a former biker and petty criminal , moved within jihadist circles after converting to @entity89 in the late 1990s -- becoming known as @entity90			0
storm , who befriended @entity4 in @entity26 in 2006 , claims he approached @entity1 intelligence later that year after becoming disillusioned with radical @entity89 , and subsequently worked with them and the @entity2 to locate and target the cleric			1
storm detailed three attempts by the @entity98 intelligence agencies to locate and target @entity4			1
the first came after @entity10 met with @entity4 in a desert camp in @entity26 in september 2009			2
he said that after he passed on details of @entity4 's location to his @entity1 and @entity6 intelligence handlers , @entity26 forces carried out an assault on the house @entity4 had been staying in , killing the owner			1
but @entity4 had already left			2
the second attempt , @entity0 told @entity15 , was the planting of a tracking device in the luggage of " @entity112 " a @entity113 convert to @entity89 , when she traveled to @entity26 to marry @entity4 in june 2010			1
storm said he arranged the match after @entity4 had requested he find him a @entity98 bride during a previous meeting			1
though @entity10 said he was paid $ 250,000 by the @entity2 for arranging the match , the operation failed after the @entity122 operatives told @entity123 to repack her luggage before traveling from @entity125 to @entity26 's southern tribal areas to marry @entity4			2
the third and successful attempt , in september 2011 , according to @entity10 , involved him arranging the handoff of a usb thumb drive with a secret tracking device to an @entity5 courier taking messages onto @entity4			1
storm said he felt betrayed after a @entity2 agent claimed to him , during a meeting that he recorded , that a different operation had netted @entity4 , and this was a significant factor in his decision to go public			2
@entity140 , one of @entity142 's leading counterterrorism experts , told @entity45 that @entity10 's decision to go public was likely a source of significant embarrassment to his handlers			0
" it is so rare that two services completely mishandle , misjudge him , and he is able to come to meetings and he has a phone and he is able to record them , " @entity140 , the research director at the @entity148 , told @entity45			0
" it also exposes the very secret , the very essence of intelligence services and that is means and methods , they never discuss means and methods , " @entity140 told @entity45			0
@entity166 's @entity113 bride 's ' identity revealed ' the @entity113 newspaper @entity168 , in articles published wednesday and thursday , claimed it had unveiled the true identity of the @entity123 , the @entity113 women storm arranged for @entity4 to marry in the hope she would lead the @entity2 to his location			1
the @entity1 agent , the @entity113 blonde and the @entity2 plot to get @entity4 the newspaper identified @entity123 as @entity178 , 35 , who had previously worked in a care home in @entity180 and had converted to @entity89 in 2008 , and it posted several pictures of her			1
the paper reported -- according to close friends -- @entity178 , a cheery athletic blonde from a small town in central @entity113 converted to @entity89 after falling in love with a @entity187 lawyer from @entity188 she met at a wedding in summer 2008			0
@entity178 had been brought up @entity190			0
the two started a long - distance relationship , but after throwing herself into her new religion , @entity178 came to feel her boyfriend was not sufficiently devout because he drank alcohol and failed to wake up for morning prayers			0
that resulted in her leaving him , according to the newspaper			0
" she changed her life habits completely and way of dressing , " and spent all her time in the mosque one friend told the newspaper			0
" she was looking for someone more radical and found him in @entity4 , " the newspaper reported			2
family and friends of @entity178 told @entity168 they had been shocked by the news that she had traveled to @entity26 to marry @entity4			2
she had told them she was going overseas for language study			0
storm told @entity15 he first came into contact with @entity123 , the @entity113 convert , in late 2009 through @entity217 , and that she soon warmed to the idea of marrying @entity4			1
at a meeting in @entity220 in spring 2010 , @entity10 showed @entity123 a short video recording made by @entity4 , who was dressed in white robes in front of a pink background with a floral motif			2
" this recording is done specifically for @entity123 at her request ... i pray @entity228 guides to that which is best for you in this life and in the hereafter			0
and guides you to choose what is better for you regarding this proposal , " @entity4 said , in a section posted on the @entity235 - @entity15 website			1
storm said @entity123 burst into tears when she heard these words			0
she then recorded two short videos for @entity4			2
in the first video , she wore a full black veil with just her face visible			0
speaking in heavily accented @entity247 , she said : " i will accept everything that is needed to do now this way that i have chosen and @entity228 will help us			0
" in the second video , @entity123 took off her veil and said : " brother , it 's me without the scarf , so you can see my hair ... i hope you are happy with me , @entity4 , " according to @entity15			1
" when i watched these tapes of video marriage proposals between her and the @entity5 leader , and this woman 's answers , i thought well this story is impossible to deny , " @entity44 , the editor of @entity15 , told @entity45			1
the @entity168 report appears to further buttress @entity10 's account			0
@entity123 and @entity4 married shortly after @entity123 arrived in @entity26 in june 2010			0
@entity166 sent storm a message thanking him for arranging the marriage			0
she had not only lived up to expectations , @entity4 wrote in a message seen by @entity15 , but was " ...			1
much better ! " after @entity4 's death in september 2011 , @entity123 continued to communicate with storm through encrypted messages , unaware that he had been working with @entity98 intelligence			1
a few months ago , she said she was working on @entity277 , the online magazine of @entity122 , or @entity122			0
she also suggested she wanted to be involved in a terrorist attack , according to @entity15			2
" i would be making a martyr operation , but @entity280 ( @entity281 , the emir of @entity122 ) said that the sisters so far ( can ) not carry out operations because it will mean a lot of problems for them ... so i can not perform operation			0
... i want to be killed the same way as my husband was ... @entity290 , " she wrote			0
@entity123 's whereabouts today are unknown			0
