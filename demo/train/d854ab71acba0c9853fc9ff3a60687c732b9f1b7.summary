environmental activists are willing to bring their qualms with their traditional ally the @entity3 right to their front door -- literally			1
opponents of the @entity6 plopped an inflatable " pipeline " on sen. @entity11 's front yard on monday -- and the @entity8 senator likely is n't complaining			1
@entity11 is trying to push the pipeline through the @entity13 as she faces an uphill climb to hold on to her seat in a december runoff against @entity17 rep. @entity17			2
the pipeline could be a boon to @entity8 's @entity21 - rich economy and passage of a bill authorizing the pipeline would be a high profile and new accomplishment that @entity11 could point to			1
the visuals of more than 50 protesters picketing on @entity11 's front yard with " no kxl " signs could bolster @entity11 's status as a serious threat to opponents of the pipeline and positions her as a key player in the effort to bring more than a dozen @entity3 on board to support the bill and send it to president @entity43 's desk			1
activists even walked up to the front stoop of @entity11 's @entity47 home and knocked on the door -- no answer			1
but progressive activists at the protest said they were n't concerned about @entity11 's reelection prospects , acknowledging that both @entity11 and her opponent support @entity6			1
" it 's one vote in the @entity13 , and either way it 's a yes vote on the @entity6 pipeline , " said @entity54 , an organizer with the environmental organization 350			0
instead , @entity54 and other activists said the protest was about more than @entity11 -- sending a message to national @entity3 that they risk losing their base if they support policies like @entity6			1
" we 're not going to lie down and say , ' oh but they 're a @entity67 , ' " @entity54 said			0
" the people that you 're looking at here , these are the people that @entity73 , the @entity3 of 2016 and beyond are going to need to knock on doors and turnout the vote			0
" thirteen other @entity3 also risk having inflatable pipelines strewn across their front yard			1
so far , 14 @entity3 , including @entity11 , reportedly plan to join @entity78 in supporting the project tuesday -- putting the @entity13 just one vote shy of the filibuster - proof 60 - vote majority			2
@entity82 , a senior at @entity83 and self - described " disillusioned @entity67 " , said she came out to oppose the pipeline project and to send a message to all democrats considering supporting the project			0
" young voters are not going to vote for anyone who approves this pipeline and it 's also shameful [ that @entity13 @entity3 are considering it ] , " @entity82 said			2
" i 'm excited that the climate movement and younger people are finally going after @entity3 and i expect that to continue as long as they continue to say yes to the pipeline			2
" the rally also brought activists from outside the @entity96 , from the areas that could be impacted if the pipeline project goes through -- an unclear outcome at the moment as @entity43 has suggested he would veto the project if it passes the @entity13			0
activists from @entity103 with the @entity105 group @entity104 said they are concerned about the environmental impact of the pipeline as well as its impact on the society			2
@entity110 , the group 's co-director , said the inflatable pipeline was a much - needed image to share their perspective			0
" they do n't understand what we 're fighting for and they need these visuals so they can feel what we 're feeling , " @entity110 said			0
" no one wants a pipeline running through their yard			0
" @entity125 , a @entity67 whose farm is one of many on the pipeline 's planned route , said he would never support @entity11 's campaign because of her betrayal of the @entity132 base " just to get reelected			1
" " we 're here to try and convince people not to support the @entity6 , " he said when asked about the impact on @entity11 's reelection prospects			1
but pressed as to whether he would support @entity11 or her @entity78 opponent , @entity125 said he would be in a bind			0
" this would be a very difficult situation for me to vote , " @entity125 said			0
" because of other issues and other differences , i would probably vote for her			0
" @entity11 's office did not immediately return a request for comment .			2

*anti-keystone* protesters picketing on @entity11 's front yard could help @entity11 in @entity8

they were also sending a *broader* message to @entity3 considering pipeline support : do n't .
