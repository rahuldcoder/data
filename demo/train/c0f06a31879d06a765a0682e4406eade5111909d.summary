@entity1 's fury over the movie comedy " @entity6 " appears to have taken the secretive state 's oversensitivity to new extremes			1
@entity8 's regime had already branded the film " the most undisguised terrorism and a war action			1
" now , the @entity13 government is set to blame @entity14 for the hacking of @entity16 , the studio responsible for the movie starring @entity18 and @entity19 that shows the assassination of @entity8			1
@entity16 has pulled the film after a threat was made against people going to see it in theaters			0
" @entity1 has provided a new gold standard for weakness in international politics : a state that feels threatened by a @entity18 movie , " tweeted @entity26 , an associate professor at @entity27 who specializes in @entity29 security issues			1
@entity1 reserves most of its rage for matters like @entity38 sanctions over its nuclear program and @entity13 - @entity41 military drills near its borders			1
but " @entity6 " is n't the first case of @entity14 freaking out over seemingly innocuous things			1
here are some striking examples : @entity47 trees the festive season is rarely full of cheer across the heavily armed border between @entity51 , known as the demilitarized zone			1
@entity47 decorations put up on the @entity41 side have become a recurring sore point			1
@entity14 especially disliked a 30 - meter tower in the shape of a christmas tree that sat atop a hill with tens of thousands of lights that could be seen from well inside @entity1 territory			1
the @entity63 reportedly said the decorations were an attempt to spread religion over the border and , in 2011 , threatened " unexpected consequences " if the lights were turned on			0
@entity41 authorities recently took down the ageing structure , but they have approved plans by a @entity73 group to build a new tower			0
@entity1 's track record of " @entity76 ! humbug ! " goes back decades -- it was objecting to @entity47 trees at the border as long ago as the 1960s			1
a report in the @entity83 from 1964 said @entity14 had also complained about @entity13 troops throwing snowballs at @entity1 soldiers around the demilitarized zone			1
soap operas @entity1 is well known for its efforts to rigidly control what information from outside its borders filters through to its citizens			2
but that apparently does n't stop some of them from eagerly seeking out illicit copies of tv shows from @entity51 and other countries			0
@entity41 dramas are reported to be particularly popular			0
the potential risks of watching the shows , which highlight the disparities between @entity1 's largely impoverished population and its neighbor to the south , are enormous			1
@entity51 's @entity105 told lawmakers in october that officials from the @entity63 's ruling party had been executed by firing squad for viewing a @entity41 soap opera			2
despite the regime 's draconian stance , its young leader has shown plenty of enthusiasm for western culture			2
@entity8 , who is believed to have gone to school in @entity118 , has been shown watching a performance featuring @entity121 characters and has befriended the eccentric former @entity123 star @entity122			0
k - pop as relations between the two @entity127 soured in 2010 after the sinking of a @entity41 warship , @entity125 retaliated by broadcasting an @entity131 radio show			1
the broadcast opened with a pop song from the @entity41 girl band @entity134			0
the @entity41 government also began setting up groups of huge speakers along the border to blast propaganda across into @entity1 , something it had n't done for years because of a thaw in relations			2
infuriated , @entity14 threatened to bomb the loudspeaker positions and turn @entity125 into " a sea of flame			2
" tightly cropped photos foreign visitors to @entity1 face a range of tight restrictions on where they go and what they do			1
those limits encompass what kind of photos they take			0
" there are many restrictions on photography that have to be obeyed in @entity1 , " warns the travel agency @entity155 , using a shorthand term for @entity1			2
photographers who have spent time in the country say that particular care must be taken when snapping pictures of statues of @entity1 leaders			2
" it 's seen as an insult to crop out hands , feet or head when taking photos of statues or pictures of government leaders or officials , " @entity167 , a documentary photographer , wrote in an article for @entity169			2
his comments were echoed by photojournalist @entity179 , who told @entity180 about her experience			0
" you have to bow ... out of respect , and if you take pictures , you should take the entire statue , " she said			0
" you can not take a portrait , for example ... because it 's a lack of respect			0
and you can not take pictures from behind			0
" @entity179 also warned that you 're not allowed to fold a newspaper with an image of the leader on it			0
balloons ok , so we 're not talking about party balloons			0
the @entity1 regime regularly works itself into a lather of rage about balloons floated over the border by @entity41 activists			1
their anger is directed specifically at the cargo carried by the balloons			0
that can include items like dollar bills , dvds and tiny am / @entity134 radios that show the prosperity in @entity51 , as well as documents criticizing the @entity1 regime			1
the balloons sometimes even carry @entity216 , cheap snacks that are viewed as high - value treats in @entity1			1
the balloons drive the regime in @entity14 nuts , drawing regular threats of violent reprisals			1
the @entity63 's state media have warned in the past of " merciless strikes " against the launches			0
in october , the @entity227 blasted anti-aircraft rounds at one flock of balloons , prompting @entity51 to respond with a burst of heavy machine gun fire			0
the @entity233 in a state built around an extreme personality cult , other belief systems can be touchy subjects			0
that 's what @entity239 , a municipal worker from @entity240 , discovered to his considerable cost earlier this year			0
during a visit to the country , @entity239 left a @entity233 at a club for foreign sailors			0
@entity1 authorities interpreted the act as a violation of its laws and held the father of three prisoner for five months			2
" i 'd read about the persecution of the @entity255 in the country -- i felt compelled to help them in some way , " @entity239 told @entity169 in october after he was released by @entity1 and flown out on a @entity13 government plane			2
although @entity1 has some state - controlled churches , the regime forbids independent religious activities			1
one that is n't true skewering the issue with its inimitable brand of satire , @entity264 summed up @entity1 's melodramatic tendencies in 2006 with a spoof article about @entity8 's father and predecessor , entitled , " @entity272			1

@entity1 has described the movie " @entity6 " as " terrorism and a war action "
but it 's not the first seemingly *harmless* thing that has enraged the *reclusive* regime
@entity14 has been known to throw a fit over @entity47 trees and @entity284
it 's also come down hard on k - pop , tightly cropped photos and balloons
