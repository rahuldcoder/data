he declared the operations imminent hazards to public safety			0
officials also ordered " 10 individual bus company owners , managers and employees to cease all passenger transportation operations , which includes selling bus tickets to passengers , " the @entity6 said in a news release			1
" these operators transport over 1,800 passengers a day , up and down the @entity24 corridor from @entity25 to @entity26 , " @entity2 said			1
" this crackdown is a victory for bus safety and the people who ride these buses			1
" the 26 shutdown orders apply to nine active companies , 13 companies already ordered out of service that were continuing to operate , three companies attempting to apply for operating authority and one ticket seller , the @entity6 said			1
all told , the companies operate between 30 and 35 buses and are based out of @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity25 , @entity44 and @entity45 , according to the department			2
officials allege the companies operated buses that needed repair , failed to test drivers for alcohol and drugs , failed to properly document driver medical qualifications , and kept the drivers behind the wheel beyond legal limits			0
" people get up every day and use a lot of different forms of transportation without thinking about the safety factor , and we do n't want them to worry about the safety of the bus they ride on or the highway they drive on , " @entity2 said			1
the crackdown was triggered after a series of deadly bus accidents and was the culmination of a yearlong investigation by the @entity75 , the @entity6 arm tasked with regulating bus safety			1
on may 31 , 2011 , one year to the day before thursday 's announcement , four passengers were killed and 53 others injured in a @entity81 bus accident			1
investigators claim fatigue on the part of driver @entity85 caused the bus to run off the road and overturn			0
@entity91 faces four counts of involuntary manslaughter and is slated to go to trial june 25 , the @entity90 @entity81 court clerk told @entity1			0
" the crash and other fatal crashes like it that occurred along @entity24 last year led our agency to conduct this unprecedented one - year investigation into dangerous and illegal bus companies operating in violation to our basic safety standards , " federal motor carrier safety administrator @entity95 told reporters			1
in another accident , @entity105 , 40 , was behind the wheel of a tour bus that crashed into a roadside barrier in @entity25 , killing 15 passengers			2

the @entity6 's statement said it has doubled the number of bus inspections of the nation 's estimated 4,000 passenger bus companies , from 12,991 in 2005 to 28,982 in 2011			1
the @entity75 shut down three primary companies -- @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124 -- which oversaw a broad network of other bus companies			2
" through the course of our investigations our enforcement teams found multiple patterns of glaring violations by the three networks of enterprises , " @entity95 said			0
she said the companies " found loopholes " and managed to get back on the road even after authorities had shut them down			0
the crackdown on alleged rogue companies was applauded by the @entity142 , a trade group representing motor coach and tour bus companies			2
the agency 's actions " went far beyond random roadside inspections , and @entity142 very much supports these types of law enforcement efforts			0
we will continue to support ( the agency ) , and we urge our members to operate at the highest level of safety , " association president @entity150 said in a statement to @entity1			2

in march , the @entity6 announced a new program , " @entity176 , " and a smartphone app that allows users to access the safety records of nearly 6,000 interstate commercial passenger carriers			1
the records consist of safety and inspection data about private bus lines , school buses and tour bus operators			1
to use the app , passengers can search the bus company or the company 's registration number			2
