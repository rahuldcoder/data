@entity0 is in session at schools across @entity4 , where students are learning to shape eyebrows , smooth foundation , apply eye - shadow , and -- perhaps -- defy economic gloom to grasp a glamorous future			1
informed by the remarkable rise of their own " head teacher " to the summit of @entity4 's cosmetics industry , the students -- for the most part young women in their 20s and 30s -- are being taught that makeup artistry can be their passport to self - confidence , independence , and a business of their own			1
making a difference to young lives is all part of the mission for 37 - year - old cosmetics queen @entity30			2
" there are certain things telling you that you can not make it ; that you will not make it ; that @entity4 is not a place where people make it , " says @entity31			2
" i beg to differ			0
" @entity30 's story @entity41 is the ceo of @entity43 of @entity44 , a household name in her native @entity46 , where the company develops makeup , perfume and accessories that eschew the @entity53 - centered tastes of the big cosmetic firms in favor of products designed specifically for @entity4 's women			1
in 1998 , aged 21 , @entity31 was already on her way to becoming a qualified lawyer when she launched @entity43 of @entity30 as a makeup studio , at first specializing in makeup designs for brides and their wedding parties			2
her artistry proved a hit with @entity4 's booming middle class and , today , the company employs over 3,000 beauty reps across @entity69			1
she says she was drawn to cosmetics by her inspirational step - mother , by seeing " what makeup actually does to a woman in terms of self - esteem and confidence			2
" the @entity30 beauty range was born out of her frustration at the lack of suitable cosmetics available in @entity4 -- " importers did n't know exactly what was right for @entity4 women , " she says -- and sense that her products could fill the gap while encouraging pride in home - grown glamor			1
" a lot of the @entity92 products are named after either beauty icons or beauty philosophies in @entity69 , " says @entity31			2
" for us it 's about sharing the world and sharing our culture to the world			0
" the past few years have seen the company expand into catwalk and film makeup design as @entity46 fashion and cinema scenes have flourished			0
when @entity107 pharmaceutical giants @entity106 came to @entity4 looking for a partner to help introduce their @entity110 range to the @entity69 country , they signed up with @entity30 , earning @entity41 a spot on @entity114 ' list of " 20 @entity115 " in the process			1
playing teacher as a child , @entity31 remembers visiting her grandmother , and gathering with the children from the local village to pass on lessons she 'd learned at school			0
" she always teased about how she expected me to be a teacher , " recalls @entity31			0
" and i would say that she was correct			0
@entity125 was correct , " she continues			0
" i am still a teacher , the only thing is this time i 'm not teaching maths or @entity129			0
i 'm teaching enterprise : i 'm teaching makeup artistry as a platform for enterprise			1
" @entity31 - @entity30 's 14 schools teach a range of courses , from short personal makeup courses to professional diplomas in makeup artistry			1
when she founded the schools a decade ago , she says few considered makeup to be a serious career prospect , with parents pushing children toward professions like law , medicine and accountancy			0
but with @entity4 's economy growing , the market for " little luxuries " such as cosmetics -- and demand for trained makeup artists for weddings , film and everyday life -- has seen a rise			1
today , @entity41 makes the lofty estimate that 80 % of @entity4 's makeup artists were trained by @entity43			2
@entity31 says she sees each student as a potential small business owner and her courses teach knowledge of the beauty industry , plus customer service and business ethics skills , in addition to practical beauty essentials			1
the aim is to equip graduates with everything they need to launch their own beauty store , and past graduates have gone on to start small firms that employ a handful of other makeup artists			1
if it seems strange for makeup artist @entity41 to be training thousands of competitors , she says you 'd be missing the point			0
" what drives me is living purpose			0
i think my business is a vehicle to change lives			0
