-- in the new movie " interstellar , " @entity1 is on the brink of becoming uninhabitable and the future of human life rests in the hands of @entity7			2
or rather , it rests in the hands of the farmer and former @entity12 pilot @entity7 plays in " @entity13 , " @entity15 's latest epic that is pretty much guaranteed to be a hot topic this awards season			1
what 's less guaranteed is whether moviegoers will take to this sci - fi adventure , which also stars @entity21 as one of the four space explorers who set off through a wormhole near @entity26 in search of a more hospitable planet			2
director and co-writer @entity15 , who has previously shown his skill with " @entity31 " trilogy and " @entity33 , " worked closely with theoretical physicist @entity34 to create an experience that would do for audiences what " 2001 : a @entity38 " once did for the director			1
" one of my earliest movie memories is my dad taking me to see ' 2001 ' in ( @entity45 's ) @entity44 on the big screen , " @entity15 recalled in an interview with the @entity40			1
" it was such an extraordinary feeling : to be taken off this planet and to the furthest reaches of the universe			0
it has really been an ambition of mine : if i ever had the opportunity to get involved in a large - scale science fiction project , something about exploring our universe , i would try to seize the opportunity			0
" with this being a @entity15 movie , the question of whether " @entity13 " is any good might seem to answer itself			1
but if you assume that there 's consensus on this one , you 'd be wrong : critics are having some stark disagreements on whether @entity15 's $ 165 million effort is a success			1
just how wide - ranging are the reviews ? take a look : will moviegoers like it ? the @entity74 ' @entity73 thinks it 's " hard to imagine that ( @entity15 's ) fans -- who represent a fairly large segment of the world 's population -- will be disappointed by ' @entity13			1
' " that 's because to @entity73 , the movie is " a terrifically entertaining science - fiction movie , giving fresh life to scenes and situations we 've seen a hundred times before , " even if it does " occasionally ( stumble ) over pompous dialogue or overly portentous music			1
" the @entity88 , however , predicts that only the diehard science geeks are going to be into this			0
" ( ' @entity13 ' ) is ardently , even fervently incomprehensible , a movie designed to separate the civilians from the geeks , with the geeks apparently the target audience , " said the magazine 's @entity91			1
" there 's no doubting @entity15 's craft ... but , overall , ' interstellar ' -- a spectacular , redundant puzzle , a hundred and sixty - seven minutes long -- makes you feel virtuous for having sat through it rather than happy that you saw it			1
" is the story emotionally resonant ? one of the big aspects to " @entity13 " is its focus on relationships , especially the relationship between parent and child			2
@entity7 's former pilot / farmer , @entity113 , has two children he leaves behind in hope of finding a new place for humans to thrive ; his preteen daughter , played by @entity119 , is particularly distraught over his abandonment			2
but that 's not all : while our space explorers are off on their search , time is moving differently for them than it is on @entity1			0
what feels like a handful of hours out in another galaxy is the equivalent of years passing for @entity113 's kids -- so many years , in fact , that @entity134 and @entity135 also star in " @entity13 " as the adult versions of @entity113 's children			1
that sounds like it 's tailor - made to be gut - wrenching , but critics were conflicted over the plot 's emotional impact			0
" it 's rare that a big - budget studio movie has such cerebral aspirations and such startling strengths and weaknesses			2
the visual spectacle can be breathtaking , but the emotional , earth - bound saga fails to be as moving , " said @entity151 's @entity150			0
" the story is ever - ambitious , sometimes riveting and thought - provoking , but also plodding and hokey and not as visionary as its cutting - edge special effects			0
and at nearly three hours , the film would have benefited from more judicious editing			0
" @entity159 's @entity158 agreed , saying in her review that " whatever his strengths may be , @entity15 lacks the human touch			1
... ( i ) n all of @entity15 's films , human connection is such a noble idea that it 's beyond the grasp of flesh - and - blood people			1
nothing in ' @entity13 ' is ever ragged or raw or dirty ( though there is , admittedly , a lot of dust )			2
" but then you have @entity176 's @entity175 , who thought " @entity13 " was " more emotionally accessible than his coolly cerebral thrillers and @entity180 movies			1
... like all the director 's best work , ( it ) manages to feel handcrafted and intensely personal			0
" and what about that ending ? the last act of " @entity13 , " says @entity188 's @entity187 , could be the make or break moment for moviegoers			1
" how you feel about the movie may hang on your reaction to this scene -- about which i 'll say only that , like the end of ' 2001 : a @entity38 , ' it takes place in a space that seems to exist in between the familiar world we know and some strange alternate dimension , " @entity187 said in her review			2
" going back over and over this crucial moment with a fellow critic on the train home , i could make no sense of it â€” where was the encounter meant to be taking place ? what laws of the universe , or of human relationships , did it purport to disclose ? but the sense of visual and spatial wonder this scene evoked in me lingered long after , accompanied by a begrudging respect for the @entity221 ' sheer commitment to their own peculiar brand of visionary hokum			0
" but then there 's the wrap 's @entity225 , who thought that ending could very well be the curse of the whole film			0
to @entity225 , the third act is an exercise in " staggering wrongheadedness , " an ending that " feels like a betrayal because so much of what comes before it manages to be truly stunning			0
" so should you see it ? if you can afford an @entity242 ticket , enjoy space - based drama and can handle disappointment , we say give it a whirl			0
but before you go , there is one thing you should know about that everyone seemed to agree on : the score , from @entity252 , is really , really loud			0
you 've been warned .			0

critical reaction to @entity15 's " @entity13 " is all over the map
some think it 's grand , if *flawed* , while others are more focused on the flaws
one consensus is that it 's going to be a talked about movie this awards season
