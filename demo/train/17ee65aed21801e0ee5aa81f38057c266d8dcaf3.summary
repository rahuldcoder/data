-- @entity1 might be most famous as the capital of @entity4 fashion and finance , but it 's an ambitious architectural project that 's generating buzz these days in the home of @entity9 and @entity10			1
@entity11 is a new 290,000 square meter ( 3.12 million square feet ) site that will encompass office , residential and green space on the previously neglected outskirts of the city			1
building work on the project started in 2009			2
when finished , it will feature numerous sleek skyscraper buildings that will juxtapose sharply with @entity1 's more traditional low - rise architecture			1
as @entity4 looks to emerge from the @entity25 crisis , there are even some who suggest developments like these could help get the country 's economy moving again			1
" the made in @entity4 brand is not just fashion and design and food , " said @entity30 , ceo of property development and management firm , @entity33			1
" now the first ( brand ) is our land			0
this is the natural resource of the country			0
the @entity43 have their oil , we have our oil in our land			0
now we have to take it back and create value			0
@entity11 is an example , " @entity30 added			1
valued at more than $ 2 billion @entity11 is 60 % financed by @entity51 investors with the remaining 40 % funded by @entity53 holdings			1
the jewels in the crown of the project are arguably the @entity57 ( roughly translated as vertical forest ) buildings			1
the taller of these two residential towers will stand 128 meters ( 419 feet ) high while more than 900 trees will adorn exterior walls and balcony space			2
a new 231 meter curved tower close by , meanwhile , will house @entity66 's @entity51 headquarters and cater for 4,000 of the financial services firm 's staff			2
@entity66 's general manager @entity69 said the new building could change the way the company structures its premises in the future			2
" the feedback ( so far ) is so positive that we will replicate this project also in other cities like @entity79			0
we have in mind also @entity81 but we change the overall headquarters philosophy in the group , " @entity69 said			0
" in reality what we put under discussion is the way that our people are sharing space			0
" major global firms such as @entity91 have also agreed to set up their @entity4 headquarters here			1
but while some see progress and opportunity , others are reserving judgment			0
" we are not used to certain skylines now you have to lift your head up , " said local architect and designer , @entity98			0
" that new way of building for @entity1 is really unusual and i guess people expect to get used to it , " he added			2
with just under a year to go until the @entity11 project is completed , traditionalists now do n't have long to savor the city 's existing skyline			1
