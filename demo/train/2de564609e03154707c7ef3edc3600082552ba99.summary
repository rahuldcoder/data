-- a two - time world lawn bowls champion has been banned from top - level competition and fined after being found guilty of match - fixing			1
@entity5 , one of @entity7 's most successful bowlers with a joint - record 10 national titles , has been suspended for six months and fined $ nz5 , 000 ( $ 3,500 ) following an incident at a tournament last year			1
it means he is likely to miss out on selection for this year 's @entity13 in @entity14			2
the @entity7 fours team , of which @entity5 was the leader , was accused by @entity16 of deliberately losing a match against @entity18 at the @entity19 in @entity20 last august			1
@entity7 were defeated 17 - 15 , having already qualified for post-section play , and @entity16 alleged the @entity22 lost on purpose to earn a more favorable quarterfinal draw			1
the subsequent investigation has caused a furore in a genteel sport most often seen as a recreational pursuit for retirees			0
@entity5 's teammates @entity30 , @entity31 and @entity32 were fined $ nz1 , 000 each ( $ 700 ) but avoided a suspension			1
a @entity35 judicial committee laid the blame at the 43 - year - old @entity5 's feet			1
" he was the skip and was literally and figuratively calling the shots			0
we are satisfied that the idea to lose the 17th end would have come from him , " it said in a statement on wednesday			0
" from what evidence we have , it is our opinion that once the @entity16 complaint was referred to it , bowls @entity35 not only proceeded with due expedition with the only course available to it but also was at pains through its counsel to provide all other requirements in a timely manner			2
" the delays that occurred subsequently were to a very large degree brought about in an effort to make sure that the respondents , at each stage of the proceedings , were not denied natural justice			0
" @entity5 , who won two world titles on home soil in 2009 , last month blamed @entity35 chief executive @entity64 for blowing the incident out of proportion			2
" the @entity16 needed to beat @entity18 otherwise they were going to miss out on the quarters			1
when it did n't happen , they put a protest in			0
but it was always an informal protest and they did n't want it to go further , " he told @entity71			0
" @entity64 turned up the next day , and he 's the guy who pushed it -- he pushed it at @entity79 level with coach @entity80 , and at the end of the day it got blown way out of proportion			2
" this is about @entity64 himself -- he does n't like me and i think he has n't done a very good job			0
it 's just a shame he 's used this to have a crack at me			0
