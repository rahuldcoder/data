@entity0 , @entity1 -- in his autobiography , @entity2 admits that he enjoys nothing more than sitting in a deck chair on a white sandy beach watching his children playing in the sea			1
private getaway : @entity2 enjoys spending time relaxing on his superyacht @entity12			1
it 's the perfect antidote to a punishing tour schedule , and with gigs in the @entity16 , @entity17 , the @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 so far this year , getting away from it all is an experience he values			1
he found that he was particularly at ease aboard the 157 ft ( 47.8m ) motor yacht @entity24 , which he chartered in 2005 and cruised with friends around the @entity27			2
the sheltered port of @entity29 at the southern end of @entity31 became one of his favorite haunts			2
in fact , @entity2 enjoyed @entity24 so much that he bought her			1
it was the first time he 'd ever had to borrow money to buy something , but he had fallen for the yacht , despite her 13 years and slightly dated looks			1
besides there was always the possibility of updating her to give her a new lease of life			2
@entity12 came with an interesting pedigree			1
she had originally been commissioned by a @entity50 ship owner in 1992 to a design by @entity52 ( of @entity54 fame ) and built by @entity55 in @entity56			2
she was then purchased by @entity59 motor racing supremo @entity57 before being sold to an @entity16			1
a steel - hulled displacement yacht with a cruising speed of about 14 knots , @entity24 can accommodate 12 guests in six separate sleeping cabins and has a crew complement of 13			2
having lived with @entity24 for a couple of years , @entity2 finally felt the time was right for a refit			1
@entity2 was particularly keen for the work to be carried out in the @entity18 , partly because he wanted to buy @entity18 but also because he could keep a close eye on proceedings			1
@entity72 in @entity73 , @entity74 , was an obvious choice			2
@entity78 , the drummer with @entity79 has his yacht @entity77 refitted regularly in @entity73 and @entity80 of the who is another famous client			2
@entity83 representative @entity82 was first introduced to the yacht during the charter show in @entity86 in december 2006			2
@entity2 has a house on the island and @entity24 is based here during the winter season			1
@entity82 quickly established a detailed proposal of work			1
the plan was to get @entity12 to @entity73 after @entity2 had finished his 2007 summer holiday so that the work could be carried out during the winter			1
the initial time frame was three months but like most complex refits this quickly extended to six as the work list grew			1
the target was to have @entity24 ready and waiting in @entity99 on july 1 this year in time for @entity2 's month - long family holiday -- a date that was set in stone to fit around his tour schedule			1
we caught up with @entity12 during a photo shoot at the end of june 2008 on the very day she was setting sail from @entity108 , @entity109 , to meet up with the boss in @entity99			1
with the final last - minute touches still being applied and the crew busily unpacking everything from the owner 's precious guitar to his children 's cuddly toys , it was a close run thing but @entity72 had met the deadline in style			2
the first thing that strikes you on boarding @entity124 is the calm , informal atmosphere of what is clearly a much - loved family yacht rather than a glitzy monument to success			2
@entity2 may be one of the world 's greatest living rock stars but he is also an unpretentious family man who wants a yacht that he can relax on			1
the saloon encapsulates this perfectly			2
rather than a single formal space with designer furniture that look so immaculate you hardly dare sit down , @entity12 's saloon is divided into four separate areas with clusters of contrasting chairs , sofas , tables and cabinets			1
one group of guests can be relaxing round the card table and matching leather chairs , while others stretch out on the big taupe corduroy sofa to watch a movie			0
that still leaves room for him to sneak off into another corner and perch on one of the special armless low - level chairs to play his guitar			0
the adjacent dining room is a little more formal but even here the overriding feeling is of a wonderfully light room centered around what looks like a huge limed - oak table inlaid with @entity167 marble			0
in fact , it is all the handiwork of a talented local artisan who painted the surface of the original table to match the materials found elsewhere on the yacht right down to the fake wooden joints and natural marble flaws			0
this solution appealed both to @entity2 's desire to refresh rather than replace where possible and his appreciation of skilled craftsmanship			1
he is a keen collector of modern art himself and every spare wall and surface reflects this passion			0
from intricate postcard - sized oil paintings of @entity189 to large , sprawling canvases and some beautiful marble sculptures and ceramic vases , it is a collection that reflects the singer 's own ability to transcend the confines of any one genre			0
perhaps that also explains the relatively neutral tones of the décor			0
there is an @entity202 theme running through the main guest areas , which the refit has refreshed and modernized rather dispensed with			0
the limed - oak paneling is original but all the garish gold door handles , light fittings and switches have either been replaced or replated in chrome to give it a much more contemporary feel			0
the high gloss white painted ceiling panels and moldings have all been meticulously flatted back to leave a softer matt finish while all the ceiling lights , some 400 of them in total , have been replaced with modern recessed spots			0
as you 'd expect aboard a musician 's yacht , the @entity220 system was another major beneficiary of the refit			0
every cabin and guest space now has a discreet @entity229 dock so that he can plug in his @entity231 wherever he is and enjoy instant access to his personal music library			0
all bar one of the existing @entity236 televisions have also been swapped for high - definition @entity238 flat screens			0
the highlight of the refit is the new owner 's suite on the main deck -- a space that @entity2 and his wife rarely used before the refit , because it is at the opposite end of the yacht to his children 's cabins			1
( they preferred the smaller but more family - friendly location of the vip guest suite next to the main run of cabins on the lower deck			0
) but it 's a much more enticing space these days			0
reconfigured by interior designers @entity262 in @entity263 , @entity0 , it now enjoys a much bigger family bathroom complete with walk - in rain shower , dramatic stone basins , a large tub and a natural teak floor			1
the key to the success of the refit , which cost in excess of @entity16 $ 4 million , lay in the planning			0
@entity72 's @entity274 and a small team started with a technical visit to the yacht in @entity108 , @entity109 , in the early summer of last year			0
within days of arriving in @entity279 had undergone sea trials with @entity281 to try and improve an ongoing issue with her performance and economy			0
it eventually transpired that one of the gearboxes had been incorrectly fitted			0
she was then moored alongside at @entity72 while her crew started the long job of removing her entire inventory			0
she also had her teak deck stripped off before she was floated into the 150m long dry dock			0
despite all the changes , @entity12 left @entity73 on time , arriving in @entity99 on july 1			1
indeed , it was during this holiday that @entity2 took time out to talk to @entity296 about his born - again @entity124 ( see p74 )			1
now that he has had a chance to enjoy the fruits of his and @entity72 's labor , @entity24 is available for charter through @entity302 in the @entity27 and @entity303			0
it 's not often you get to walk in the shadow of a genuine rock legend but on @entity24 you can also swim , sunbathe and sleep in @entity2 's personal holiday home			1
chartering just does n't get any better than that			0
