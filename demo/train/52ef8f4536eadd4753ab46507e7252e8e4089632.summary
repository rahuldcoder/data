-- @entity2 's governor says he will sign a bill abolishing the death penalty , making it the 17th state to abandon capital punishment			1
on wednesday night , lawmakers in @entity2 's @entity9 passed the bill by a vote of 86 - 63			1
the @entity11 approved it last week			0
" i 'm pleased the @entity9 passed the bill , and when it gets to my desk i will sign it , " said gov. @entity13 , a @entity14			1
" when i sign this bill , @entity2 will join 16 other states and almost every other industrialized nation in moving toward what i believe is better public policy			1
" @entity22 did not say when his office will receive the bill			2
@entity2 's move continues a national trend toward the abolition of capital punishment			1
in the past five years , four states have done so			2
state lawmakers in @entity2 first tried to pass a similar bill in 2009 -- but were ultimately blocked by then - gov. @entity31 , a @entity32			1
capital punishment has existed in the state since its colonial days			1
but the state was forced to review its death penalty laws beginning in 1972 , when a @entity38 decision required greater consistency in its application			0
a moratorium was then imposed until a 1976 court decision upheld the constitutionality of capital punishment			1
since then , @entity2 juries have handed down 15 death sentences			2
of those , only one person has actually been executed , according to the @entity49 , a nonpartisan group that studies death penalty laws			0
@entity51 , a convicted serial killer , was put to death by lethal injection in 2005 after he voluntarily gave up his appeals			0
the state currently has 11 people on death row			0
the bill , however , is prospective in nature , meaning that it would not apply to those already sentenced to death			0
advocates of a repeal say @entity2 's current law keeps inmates on death row for extended periods of time , who are often engaged in multiple appeals , and presents taxpayers with far larger costs than if the convict were placed in the general prison population serving a life sentence			2
they also point to instances in which wrongful convictions have been overturned with new investigative methods , including forensic testing			0
opponents of the repeal commonly argue that capital punishment serves as a criminal deterrent , offering justice for victims and their families			1
in the last five years , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 have repealed the death penalty			0
@entity93 voters will decide the issue in november			0
the other non-death penalty states are @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 , @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 , according to the @entity49 .			0

@entity109 passes the bill 86 - 63
" when it gets to my desk i will sign it , " governor says
@entity2 would be *5th* state in 5 years to abolish capital punishment
