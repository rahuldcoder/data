that 's all that needs to be said about president @entity4 's decision this week to stop playing footsie with @entity7 senators and push through the recess appointments for the head of the @entity10 and members of the @entity12			1
@entity7 are in a tizzy , saying he is establishing a bad precedent with the moves			2
but frankly , they need to shut up			0
it has been their shameful and callous actions in holding up countless presidential nominees that has led us to this precarious moment in political history			2
but let 's not act like the @entity27 senators are standing on firm moral ground			1
they were also obstructionists during the final few years of president @entity31 's second term , and they played the same game of hideaway as the @entity7 are doing now , even though the @entity7 has taken stalling to extraordinary heights			1
as for president @entity4 , he has played nice for far too long , unwilling to load up the administration with his nominees through the constitutionally protected avenue of recess appointments			1
it 's hilarious to listen to strict constructionist conservatives talk about the @entity45 @entity44 as a hallowed document , only to hear their chagrin when someone actually follows it			2
every president has the right to make recess appointments , and if you hear the @entity7 critics , you would swear presidents @entity53 and @entity31 did n't use the power of recess appointments to fill vacancies			1
but they did , specifically with the @entity12 , the same group that now has three open slots that the @entity7 has been blocking president @entity4 from filling			1
this is a silly , partisan game that i ca n't stand			0
every president should be able to appoint a team to his liking			0
yes , the @entity45 @entity44 says the @entity63 gets to " advise and consent , " but it says nothing about holding up appointments in perpetuity			0
it 's shameful when a president makes an appointment and that person goes six months to nearly two years before they get a hearing or an up - and - down vote			2
the @entity63 should be able and willing to move a lot faster when filling vacancies , but the partisan divide keeps that from happening			0
with president @entity4 in office , the @entity7 does n't want to see what they describe as liberal judges appointed to the federal bench			1
and when there is a @entity7 in the @entity83 , @entity27 voice their anger at conservative judges being appointed			1
folks , that 's what happens in elections			0
there are consequences to winning and losing			0
president @entity4 's willingness to take on the @entity92 directly is a welcome departure from the reach - out - and - touch someone philosophy he operated by the last three years			1
look , i get bipartisanship -- we should have folks from both parties acting like grownups and getting along -- but if you look at the overwhelming number of @entity4 appointees being held up , it 's clear that this system is broken			1
weakness is nothing to be happy about			0
and too often , president @entity4 has operated more on the weak and meek side when dealing with @entity92 rather than as a strong leader with conviction			1
this decision , coupled with the far more aggressive tone he has taken with his critics , has led to an increase in his poll numbers , and is the kind of fire in the belly his supporters are happy to see			0
the fear is that the president will fall back into the mode of walking softly with a big stick			0
sorry , when folks are misbehaving , you have to whack them upside the head with that big stick in order for them to get the message			0
the @entity7 can crow all day about these appointments			2
they are likely to lose if they challenge the president in court			0
maybe their continuing intransigence will keep president @entity4 operating with a short fuse , ready to explode on the opposition when warranted			1
now that 's a change in attitude we can believe in			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity143 .			2

president @entity4 filled several key posts through recess appointments
@entity143 says he had to act because @entity7 were stalling his nominees
he says @entity27 also were *wrong* in obstructing appointments by @entity31
@entity143 says @entity4 's new tough approach is long overdue
