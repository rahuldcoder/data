@entity0 -- former federal judge and conservative legal scholar @entity4 died early wednesday at his @entity7 home , his family confirmed to @entity1			1
perhaps best known for his nomination to the @entity9 by president @entity10 in 1987 , @entity4 was rejected for the post after a contentious confirmation battle led by left - leaning groups that opposed his conservative judicial philosophies			1
@entity4 had recently served as a senior legal adviser to @entity19 @entity18 's presidential campaign			1
he was a solicitor general during the @entity21 administration and first gained notoriety for carrying out the president 's order to fire the special prosecutor investigating the @entity26 in 1973 , an episode known as the @entity28			0
but it was the @entity30 's rejection of his high court nomination that earned the conservative @entity4 a political legacy -- symbolic of the contentious , partisan nature of congressional confirmations			1
@entity4 was also known as a staunch advocate for " originalism , " a principle that defends the original intent of the @entity39			1
in recent years , @entity4 became a well - regarded conservative voice on legal and constitutional matters , as well as the author of several books including " @entity44 : modern liberalism and @entity47 decline			1
" he was also a frequent commentator			0
he told @entity1 in 2005 that he had to endure his failed nomination as a metaphor			2
to " @entity4 " someone has entered the popular lexicon as attacking a public figure in the media for partisan gain			1
" my name became a verb , " he said			0
" and i regard that as one form of immortality			0
" @entity9 justice @entity59 , a longtime friend , described @entity4 as " one of the most influential legal scholars of the past 50 years			1
" " his impact on legal thinking in the fields of @entity65 and @entity66 was profound and lasting , " said @entity59			0
" more important for the final accounting , he was a good man and a loyal citizen			0
may he rest in peace			0
" photos : 15 @entity9 cases that changed @entity47 @entity59 and fellow conservative @entity9 @entity73 followed @entity4 's example of a strict interpretation of the @entity39			1
that position made @entity4 " one of the intellectual godfathers of the conservative movement in this country , " according to @entity1 senior legal analyst @entity77			1
@entity4 was born in @entity81 in 1927 and attended the @entity82 , where his conservative leanings were forged			1
he was a @entity84 veteran			0
after private practice and a teaching stint at @entity87 , he was named to the @entity88 in 1973 at the height of the @entity26 crisis			0
when attorney general @entity91 and his deputy @entity92 abruptly resigned rather than carry out orders to dismiss special prosecutor @entity94 , @entity4 stepped in and carried out @entity21 's demands			1
he was criticized for bowing to political pressure but remained on the job			0
@entity21 resigned a year later			0
@entity10 named @entity4 in 1981 to the high - profile @entity98 , where he served with future justices @entity59 and @entity100			1
@entity4 was seriously considered for the 1986 high court vacancy that eventually went to @entity59 , who still serves as the senior associate justice			1
the retirement a year later of justice @entity104 promised an ideological sea change on the divided high court			0
@entity104 was a centrist and the court 's key swing vote			0
the @entity109 quickly focused on @entity4 , hoping it would move the court to the right			1
one major roadblock : unlike the @entity59 confirmation a year earlier , @entity113 now controlled the @entity30 and were prepared for a fight			2
@entity4 's confirmation was the most bitter @entity0 had seen in years , and he was ultimately rejected by the @entity30 58 - 42 , the largest margin of defeat ever for a court nominee			1
from @entity4 to @entity120 in 7 steps the concern for many senators was not one of qualification but of temperament			2
@entity4 's paper trail was extensive			2
he was an outspoken and prolific jurist with a clear , unapologetic conservative record			0
civil rights groups and liberal lawmakers attacked his writings and rulings on voting , free speech and , especially , on reproductive rights			0
" @entity4 's @entity47 is a land in which women would be forced into back - alley abortions , blacks would sit at segregated lunch counters , rogue police could break down citizens ' doors in midnight raids , schoolchildren could not be taught about evolution , " sen. @entity136 , @entity137 , said at the time			2
" the doors of the federal courts would be shut on the fingers of millions of citizens			0
" during the nationally televised hearings before the @entity153 , @entity4 sparred with lawmakers , strongly defending his " originalist " judicial philosophy and rejecting suggestions the @entity39 was a " flexible " document that offered new rights in changing political and social times			1
@entity4 believed in " strict constructionalism , " that judges should rule based only on the text of the @entity39 as it was originally enacted , and should not be seen as righting all social ills			1
in 2005 , @entity4 told @entity1 's " @entity173 " what made a good justice : " a willingness to apply the @entity39 according to the principles that are actually in it rather than what they call the ' evolving ' or the ' living ' @entity39 , " he said , " which simply means the judges begin to make it up			1
" friends and colleagues offered tributes to the conservative legal icon			0
" @entity4 was one of @entity47 's greatest jurists and a brilliant legal mind , " said sen. @entity178 , @entity179 , a onetime constitutional lawyer and friend of the judge			1
" he was an expert on issues ranging from antitrust to privacy laws and was deeply influential in promoting constitutional originalism			0
despite the unfortunate and unnecessary controversy surrounding his @entity9 nomination , judge @entity4 remained an inspirational figure for those seeking to enforce constitutional limits on the federal government			1
our thoughts and prayers are with the @entity4 family			2
" that political fight raised the stakes for future @entity9 nominations , bringing a new level of intensity and partisanship to the process			2
groups on both sides of the ideological debate saw advantages in pointing out the impact the high court and its nine justices have on the rule of law and the hot - button issues decided			0
the @entity9 in june made a landmark opinion , upholding the sweeping health care reform law championed by president @entity216			2
rulings on affirmative action , voting rights and same - sex marriage can be expected by next june			0
justices order another look at key health care provision years after the political fight , @entity4 admitted that the partisan rejection of his nomination was personally trying			1
he had stepped down from the bench a year after it			0
@entity4 suffered in past years with heart disease			2
