when @entity1 delivered his notorious answer about rape and abortion , i was sorry that the debate moderator failed to follow up with the next question : " ok , mr. @entity1 , you say your principles require a raped woman to carry the rapist 's child to term			1
that 's a heavy burden to impose on someone			0
what would you do for her in return ? would you pay her medical expenses ? compensate her for time lost to work ? would you pay for the child 's upbringing ? college education ? " if a woman has her credit card stolen , her maximum liability under federal law is $ 50			0
yet on your theory , if she is raped , she must endure not only the trauma of assault , but also accept economic costs of potentially many thousands of dollars			2
must that burden also fall on her alone ? when we used to draft men into the @entity35 , we gave them veterans ' benefits afterward			2
if the state now intends to conscript women into involuntary childbearing , surely those women deserve at least an equally generous deal ? " that question sounds argumentative , and i suppose it is			1
opinion : @entity1 's rape remark and extremism but there 's a serious point here , and it extends well beyond the anguishing question of sexual assault			0
if you 're serious about reducing abortion , the most important issue is not which abortions to ban			2
the most important issue is how will you support women to have the babies they want			2
as a general rule , societies that do the most to support mothers and child - bearing have the fewest abortions			0
societies that do the least to support mothers and child - bearing have more abortions			0
@entity67 , for example , operates perhaps the world 's plushest welfare state			1
working women receive 14 weeks of maternity leave , during which time they receive pay from the state			1
the state pays a child allowance to the parents of every @entity67 child for potentially as many as 25 years , depending on how long as the child remains in school			1
women who leave the work force after giving birth receive a replacement wage from the state for up to 14 months			2
maybe not coincidentally , @entity67 has one of the lowest abortion rates , about one - third that of the @entity87			1
yet @entity67 abortion laws are not especially restrictive			1
abortion is legal during the first trimester of pregnancy and available if medically or psychologically necessary in the later trimesters			2
even here in the @entity87 , where parental benefits are much less generous , abortion responds to economic conditions			1
in the prosperous 1990s , abortion rates declined rapidly			1
in the less prosperous ' 00s , abortion rates declined more slowly			1
when the economy plunged into crisis in 2008 , abortion rates abruptly rose again			1
these trends should not surprise anyone			0
women choose abortion for one overwhelming reason : economic insecurity			1
the large majority of women who chose abortion in 2008 , 57 % , reported a disruptive event in their lives in the previous 12 months : most often , the loss of a job or home			1
@entity118 on @entity1 : male politicians should n't make abortion decisions of the women who choose abortion , 58 % are in their 20s			1
some 61 % of them already have a child			0
almost 70 % of them are poor or near poor			0
three - quarters say they can not afford another child			0
pro-life and pro-choice debaters delight in presenting each other with exquisitely extreme moral dilemmas : " would you ban abortion even in case of rape ? " " would you permit abortion even when done only to select the sex of the child ? " these dorm - room hypotheticals do not have very much to do with the realities of abortion in the @entity87 and elsewhere			2
here 's an interesting example of those realities : the @entity144 has one of the the most liberal abortion laws in the world			2
yet for a long time , the @entity144 also reported one of the world 's lowest abortion rates			1
that low incidence abruptly began to rise in the mid- 1990s			0
between 1996 and 2003 , the abortion rate in the @entity144 jumped by 31 % over seven years			1
what changed ? the @entity154 , the leading source of data on reproductive health worldwide , cites " a growing demand for terminations from women in ethnic minority groups residing in the country			0
" well over half of all abortions performed on teenagers in the @entity144 are performed on girls of @entity168 origins			0
these girls and women were n't being raped			0
they were n't selecting for the sex of their child			0
they chose abortion because they had become sexually active within male - dominated immigrant subcultures in which access to birth control was restricted , in which female sexuality was tightly policed , in which girls who become pregnant outside marriage are disgraced and in which the costs and obligations of childbearing loaded almost entirely on women alone			1
abortion is a product of poverty and maternal distress			0
a woman who enjoys the most emotional and financial security and who has chosen the timing of her pregnancy will not choose abortion , even when abortion laws are liberal			0
a woman who is dominated , who is poor and who fears bearing the child is likely to find an abortion , even where abortion is restricted , as it was across the @entity87 before 1965			0
@entity206 : mourdock criticism ' gotcha politics ' so maybe at the next candidates ' debate , a journalist will deflect the discussion away from " what if " and instead ask this : " rather than tell us what you 'd like to ban , tell us please what you think government should do to support more happy and healthy childbearing , to reduce unwanted pregnancies and to alleviate the economic anxieties of mothers - to - be ? " those are the questions that make the difference			2
it 's amazing how little we talk about them .			0
