@entity1 when model @entity3 twirled down a @entity5 runway this week in a navy @entity8 gown with triangular waist cutouts , it was hard to mistake her famous fashion - family lineage			1
for five decades now , another woman has sashayed down fashion - show runways around the globe with a similar theatrical flair : her mother			1
@entity16 became a catwalk enigma during the @entity18 of the 1960s and ' 70s			1
with her mixed ethnic heritage -- white , black and @entity21 -- she danced the lines of race just as she danced down the runways of @entity25 and @entity1 with a finesse akin to @entity27			1
@entity16 jump - started her career as a model for the @entity30 when she was just 15 years old			1
her curly , free - flowing black hair and her signature runway twirls quickly set her apart			1
soon , she was not only posing for @entity30 but for the covers of @entity35 and @entity36			1
she was painted by @entity37 , partied with @entity38 and modeled for @entity39 alongside of - the - moment beauty icons like @entity41 and @entity42			1
" @entity43 wanted to be boys			2
we had cigarettes ; we had the pill , " @entity16 , whose full name is @entity46 , said of her androgynous stage name and free - spirited approach			1
though she is credited with revolutionizing both the runway and perceptions of beauty of that era , she said she had more than a fair share of doors slammed in her face			2
now , as her daughter navigates the same high - fashion industry , @entity2 sat down with the mother - daughter duo to talk about beauty			2
the conversation has been edited for brevity and clarity			2
@entity2 : @entity3 , what was your first memory of fashion ? @entity3 : i remember my first pair of shoes that my mom got me , and they were these pink , little plastic shoes			1
and i remember putting them on and that sound of , like , " @entity79 , tic , tic , tic " -- there was something about that sound			2
... it made me feel really good : empowered , confident somehow			2
@entity2 : what did you mother teach you about beauty ? @entity3 : one thing that i think was interesting growing up as a kid , i got made fun of a lot because i was different			1
i was a flagpole , and all the girls had beautiful breasts , and i had no breasts ! she told me you do n't have to fit into a category			2
@entity16 : first of all , look at the goddesses			1
throughout history , there have been different types of beauty			2
there are so many forms of the feminine , and just take that and say , " here i am , this divine , feminine creature			2
" @entity3 : i think it 's finding one feature of yourself , one feature that really makes you happy			1
@entity16 : and it 's always your flaw that is your best feature			1
@entity2 : what 's that feature for you ? @entity16 : i know i have ( had ) very curly hair			1
it was always a problem for me , but it kind of became my flying carpet			2
i kind of have a crookedy nose , and my nose is one of my ( distinctive ) features			2
@entity3 : my longness , my nose			1
i have very long features			0
i learned to love that looking back at @entity134 paintings			0
i found that " oh , this person resembled me a little bit			0
" and i started to realize this long feature is who i am , and i better accept and roll with it			0
new looks rock the boat , and they break the mold			0
that 's what you got to do : you got to rock the boat a little bit			0
@entity2 : and you certainly did that , @entity149 @entity16 : in the 1960s , it was really difficult in @entity152 because it was black and white , and i was standing on the fence like , ' oh , do i need to tip this way or that way ? ' @entity3 : it 's so beautiful to be a mixture of everything			1
you feel like you can fit in wherever you go			0
@entity2 : the fashion industry is often criticized for the opposite -- for unrealistic body image			0
@entity16 : what i want to say about body image is that every beautiful woman is beautiful first -- like a flower -- from the inside			1
but you have to recognize that beauty			0
and now we have all sorts of images -- thank @entity175 -- and everything is eclectic and just so individual			0
beauty is finding your own individual state of being			0
so , you can either water yourself with love or hate yourself			0
@entity2 : so why this ? why fashion ? @entity3 : life is about creating something that you love and finding what you love			1
being my mother 's daughter , i went through a phase where i thought , is it really my thing , or is it her thing ? at a certain point , i kind of rejected it			0
and in that time , i found how much fashion brought me to life and it was something that inspired me			0
@entity2 : both of you have been described as " muses " for various designers			0
@entity3 : i never thought that			1
being a muse is being amusing			0
it 's taking a vision and creating reality			0
i think for me it becomes not of myself , it becomes for them			0
you 're an extension of them			0
i like to call it chameleon - izing			0
i like to play different characters ; this dress makes me feel like a catwoman ; this dress makes me feel like a princess , etc. @entity2 : what does it take ? @entity16 : it 's an attitude , and it depends on society			1
having owned a modeling agency , i 've seen different types of beauties come in because of the political atmosphere , so you have to think it 's a global state of affairs as to what kind of beauty will be prominent at what time			0
i think everyone will have a chance at some time			0
@entity2 : @entity16 , any last general advice to mothers with or without children in the fashion business ? @entity16 : you have to be nourishing , be present and have gravity			1
when they get off track , pull them back .			0
