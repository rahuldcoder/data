a ground - breaking cell transplant has allowed a paralyzed man to walk again , researchers announced tuesday			1
@entity4 man @entity3 , 38 , had been left paralyzed from the chest down after a 2010 knife attack caused an 8mm gap in his spinal cord			1
an initial 13 months of rehabilitation followed by an additional 8 - month program before the experimental treatment had not produced an improvement in his condition , researchers said			1
but two years after the 2012 cell transplant he can walk with the aid of a @entity19 frame , also known as a walker			1
scientists at @entity22 ( @entity22 ) developed the treatment , which saw olfactory ensheathing cells ( @entity25 ) from the nose transplanted to @entity28 's spinal cord			1
oecs are what allow the sense of smell to return when nerve cells in the nose are damaged			2
surgeons at @entity35 in @entity4 led by dr @entity36 injected the @entity25 above and below @entity28 's spinal cord gap , then used nerve tissue taken from his ankle to act as a bridge for spinal nerves to grow across , @entity22 said			1
three months after the surgery , @entity28 's thigh muscle began to grow and three months after that he started to walk with leg braces and the help of a physiotherapist , researchers said			1
being able to walk with a @entity19 frame or walker two years on , @entity3 said , was an incredible feeling			1
" when you ca n't feel almost half your body , you are helpless , but when it starts coming back it 's as if you were born again , " he said			1
bladder sensation and some sexual function have also returned , the @entity22 said			1
@entity22 's professor @entity59 discovered @entity25 in 1985 and headed the team whose research led to the breakthrough			1
previous studies have shown these cells to be popular candidates for research on repairing spinal cord injuries			2
these are not the same cells like the controversial human embryonic stem cells used in the @entity72 's 2010 trial in the @entity73			0
before that trial was stopped due to funding issues , none of the patients enrolled were able to walk			1
a 2012 @entity79 study launched by @entity81 - based @entity80 , led to some sensations returning in one patient			1
spinal ' roadway ' in an interview with @entity87 's @entity86 , @entity59 explained how his idea had developed			1
" the problem with spinal injury is that nerve fibers are severed by the injury so that impulses that carry movement -- the desire for movement -- down from the brain to the body are cut off			1
impulses carrying sensations up from the body to the brain are cut off , " he said			0
" so , my idea , which i followed for many , many years , is that actually the nervous system is capable of repairing itself , actually the cut nerve fibers are capable of growing back -- but they lack a pathway to cross the injury			1
" so it 's as though a motorway has been damaged			0
the cars still know where they want to go , but there is no roadway for them to go across			0
thinking that way , the question is -- what could we use to make a bridge			1
" now , we do n't know how the bridge would work , we do n't understand the basis of this , so our idea was ' is there somewhere else where nerve fibers are able to relay the road ? ' and the only place we know is the olfactory system , the sense of smell			0
" the underlying idea is ' can we get something out of an area where repair works and transfer it into an area where repair does n't work and will it then cause a repair ?			0
' " @entity59 compared the process to repairing a washed - out motorway			0
" what you have to do is put a bridge across the injury			0
exactly the same applies to the spinal cord -- the nerve fibers which have been cut are trying to grow , they 're trying to find their way across			2
" they ca n't get across because there 's a damage , there 's scarring on either side -- there are road barriers up			2
what we have to do is pull down those barriers and build a bridge along which they can grow			0
" that 's what these cells are doing , " he said			0
the @entity25 carried out the same regenerative function for the nerve fibers of the spinal cord as they did for the olfactory system , he said			0
but @entity59 stressed that the procedure needed to be further developed : " until we repeat this in a number more patients it 's just that one patient			1
" ' not convinced breakthrough ' dr. @entity172 , @entity173 and chairman of @entity175 at @entity176 echoed that sentiment			0
" they 've got one patient who did well and that 's a wonderful , " he told @entity87 but added that he was not convinced it was a breakthrough : " if you ca n't reproduce it , it 's not real			2
" @entity28 's spinal cord had not been completely severed in the knife attack meaning -- while he had an 8mm gap -- 2mm of tissue remained , @entity172 said			2
@entity187 said laboratory studies had shown much more significant recovery in patients whose spinal cords were only partially severed			0
he queried whether the rehabilitation @entity3 had had before the new treatment had been a factor in his recovery			1
" the question is it all the physical therapy , or the cells he 's getting ? " @entity172 said			0
" i 'm not convinced that this is a breakthrough , " he said			0
" it definitely is n't the answer for everybody -- or even everybody with the same injury -- until we have more examples with more than one patient			1
" ' provocative ' @entity208 , @entity209 , @entity210 , director of spinal cord injury research at @entity212 in @entity73 city of @entity214 said the researchers ' findings were a " very provocative outcome			2
" " if similar results are observed beyond this one patient , then bulbar olfactory ensheathing cells ( @entity25 ) would be a game - changer , " @entity208 said			2
" while prior ( unsuccessful ) studies used @entity25 harvested from the nasal mucosa ( i.e. , tissue in the nose ) , these @entity25 were harvested from the area where they grow -- just below the brain			2
" it is possible that obtaining these cells from their source using this more invasive approach made the difference , but it wo n't be possible to know until results from more people are available			0
" @entity235 noted that @entity28 had also had scar tissue removed and that there had been documented cases where this process had resulted in improved function			0
funding in a statement released by the @entity22 tuesday , @entity59 said the development of the technique was " immensely gratifying			1
" " i believe we stand on the threshold of a historic advance and that the continuation of our work will be of major benefit to mankind			0
i believe we have now opened the door to a treatment of spinal cord injury that will get patients out of wheel chairs , " @entity59 said			0
researchers now need to develop the procedure to a point where it could be rolled out world wide , he said			2
the research was funded by the @entity263 @entity262 and @entity264 ( nsif )			0
@entity265 was founded by @entity266 after his son @entity267 was instantly paralyzed after diving into a sandbank during a gap year in @entity271 in 2003			2
" one of the most devastating moments a parent will ever experience is the sight of their son or daughter lying motionless in a bed and facing the reality that they may never walk again , " @entity266 said in a statement on the development			2
" the young man who was in the bed next to @entity286 in @entity271 , also paralyzed from the neck down , had parents who were so traumatized by the finality of their son 's condition that they came to visit him once and never came back , " he said			1
" i promised @entity286 that i would not give up until a cure had been found			0
professor @entity293 and dr. @entity36 's breakthrough marks the first step			0
" the full research paper is published in the medical journal " @entity298			0

researchers say a 2012 cell transplant has allowed a paralyzed man to walk again
@entity305 surgeons used a technique developed at @entity22
researchers say , two years on , the patient can walk with a @entity19 frame -- or walker
@entity3 said the feeling of recovering the ability to walk was " as if you were born again "
