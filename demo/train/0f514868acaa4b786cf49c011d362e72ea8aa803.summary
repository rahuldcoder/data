-- a little boy named @entity2 , adopted from @entity3 several years ago as a toddler , celebrated @entity5 this year with his family in my home state of @entity9			1
across the ocean , his little brother @entity10 , 5 , did n't even know it was @entity5			0
he simply woke up and lived yet another day of his life in a state orphanage , dreaming of his brother and the parents he met last year , knowing that they are waiting for him in a home somewhere far away			0
@entity2 's parents found out about @entity10 too late to adopt the two brothers together			0
but as soon as they learned about @entity10 , they knew they would adopt him , too			0
they were still in the midst of a drawn - out , three - year process to adopt @entity10 when on december 28 , @entity3 president @entity25 signed into law a ban on all @entity29 adoptions of @entity3 orphans			1
the news of the ban devastated hundreds of children and families like @entity2 and @entity10 's			1
dozens of families were only days or weeks away from flying to @entity3 for the final court date that would have allowed them to bring their child home			2
many of these families have shown me pictures of these children they already love so much			0
these are children who have known only the life of an orphanage since birth and whose disabilities make it unlikely that @entity3 families will adopt them			2
these orphans now sit and wait , clinging to photos of their @entity29 parents , asking when their mama and papa will come for them			1
according to the @entity58 , 740,000 children live in @entity3 without parental care			1
the @entity3 @entity60 estimates that 110,000 of these children live in state orphanages			2
in contrast , only 7,400 domestic adoptions took place in @entity3 in 2011 , with an additional 3,400 adoptions of @entity3 children by families from abroad			1
for an orphan , there is no substitute for a family			1
not even the best orphanage can provide a child what a loving mother and father can			0
staff , not parents , run orphanages			0
and despite any government 's best intentions , hunger , neglect , extreme heat and cold and other forms of deprivation are common features of institutional life			0
but even more crushing is the lack of security , connection and deep emotional bonds that can grow only within a family			0
children who grow up in orphanages tell stories of never having heard the words " i love you " and never receiving a single spontaneous hug throughout their childhood			0
a government can pay someone to wash and feed children , but it can not pay someone to love them			0
children with disabilities face an even bleaker fate			0
for a host of reasons , children with disabilities are rarely if ever adopted in @entity3 and elsewhere			2
because of the harsh realities of institutional life -- limited staff ; scant resources for food , utilities and other needs ; little to no medical care -- a large percentage of orphans with disabilities do not even survive childhood			0
this means that for children with @entity129 , cerebral palsy , blindness , deafness or other disabilities , being adopted by an @entity29 family may be the only chance they will have not only to receive specialized therapy and life - saving medical care but to know the unconditional love , acceptance and joy of being a cherished member of something special called family			1
it is these orphaned children -- the weakest of the most vulnerable -- whom the @entity3 adoption ban has punished			1
in june , i traveled to @entity3 with a bipartisan congressional delegation , taking part in meetings related to national security in the wake of the @entity154 bombings			1
we also made it a point to reiterate our profound hope that the @entity3 government will reconsider the adoption ban , and at the very least , allow for the completion of the cases for the children and families who were near the end of the adoption process			1
i emphasized in these meetings our desire to provide whatever post-placement reports and information might be necessary to provide the @entity3 government their desired assurances of the well - being of adopted children			2
i 've also introduced a bipartisan resolution emphasizing much of the above , and most importantly calling on @entity3 to remember that every child deserves to be in a loving , protective and permanent family			1
i am confident that @entity177 leadership will move this legislation forward and that president @entity179 and secretary of state @entity180 will proactively reaffirm our commitment to building a better future for every child in desperate need of a family			0
even in the complicated tides of modern political life , the weakest and most vulnerable members of society must never be forgotten or cast aside			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity191 .			2

@entity191 : @entity3 should lift its ban on @entity29 adoptions of @entity3 orphans
@entity191 : for an orphan , there is no substitute for a family and parental love
she says @entity3 's ban is punishing the weakest of the most vulnerable of its society
@entity191 : i 've introduced a bipartisan resolution urging @entity3 to reconsider ban
