the ancient city of @entity1 is now a warzone as president @entity4 's army strikes fiercely at the heart of @entity7 's 11 - month - old anti-government uprising			1
hundreds in @entity1 have been killed by rockets , mortar rounds and snipers ' bullets since the start of the year , say opposition groups , as the @entity7 regime tries to regain control of the country 's third largest city			1
the humanitarian crisis in @entity1 is worsening -- dozens are reported dead nearly every day , and opposition activists say they do n't have enough doctors or medical supplies to treat the wounded			1
@entity1 , known as the capital of the revolution , has seen the worst of the violence that has left at least 6,000 people dead since protests began in @entity7 in march 2011			1
located in the agricultural heartland of central @entity7 , the city has long been a transport and commercial hub of vital strategic importance			1
the road through @entity1 connects the capital , @entity36 , in the south to @entity7 's largest city , @entity39 , in the north			1
@entity1 is home to one of two oil refineries in the country ; preserving that oil supply is crucial to the @entity4 regime 's ongoing efforts to crush the anti-government movement there			1
the city 's citizens , known as " @entity51 , " hold a contradictory place in the @entity7 national conscience , according to @entity54 , a @entity7 analyst for the @entity55			1
" @entity51 are often the butt of jokes in @entity7 , " said @entity54 , " but they 've actually got quite a large cultural and educational influence on the country			2
" the city of 1 million is one of @entity7 's most ethnically diverse			1
traditionally a @entity63 merchant town , a considerable number of @entity65 , a @entity67 sect , have settled in @entity1 in the past 30 years , and there also is a small @entity70 population in the city			1
" we live in a complex community , with many different sects and religions , " a @entity1 opposition spokesman -- who uses the name @entity74 to hide his real identity from security forces -- told @entity77			1
" before the uprising , we were all living here as brothers and we did n't think there were differences between us , " said @entity74 from central @entity1 , where scores have been killed in non-stop fighting between opposition and regime forces this month			1
@entity1 is more warzone than city now , he says			2
parts of the city are without electricity ; in other parts , security forces shut off the electricity and telecommunications networks ahead of early morning raids to root out opposition members			1
" if you 're in a place where they cut off the power or the phones , you know you 're in trouble , " said @entity74			0
there is a shortage of everything from children 's milk formula to oil for heating , and he says security forces are preventing medical aid from reaching dying citizens			2
many of the injured are being treated in field hospitals in civilian homes , including some who died from wounds that would not have been fatal with proper care			0
" every day there are murders -- snipers on the roofs are shooting anything that moves , preventing the arrival of medical supplies and shooting at ambulances			0
it 's a very hard situation , " said @entity74			0
a 26 - year - old born and raised in a middle class family in @entity1 , @entity74 left his medical studies at @entity137 to help organize protests against @entity4 's government in march			1
but the city and its once - vibrant sidewalk cafe culture are now in lockdown mode after fighting intensified there recently			0
defectors from the military have joined volunteers in forming the @entity147 in @entity1 , and residents in some neighborhoods have organized into armed defense committees , according to a report from @entity152			2
with at least 60 checkpoints set up in @entity1 and dozens of tanks now surrounding the city , the opposition fears @entity4 is plotting an attack that could rival the 1982 crackdown in @entity159 , when regime tanks and troops killed thousands of people and reduced parts of that city to rubble			1
president @entity4 denies responsibility for the escalating violence in @entity7 , and distanced himself from his armed forces in a recent television interview			1
" they are not my forces , " @entity4 told @entity172 's @entity171			2
" they are forces for the government			2
i do n't own them			0
i do n't own the country			0
so they are not my forces			0
" the bloodshed has left city residents on edge			2
public life is limited to about six hours each day from 9:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. , says @entity74 -- shops close soon after that and people are rarely seen on the street			0
@entity74 himself hid in a friend 's basement in the relatively calm @entity192 neighborhood for days , as he did n't feel safe to return to his own home			0
" my neighborhood is surrounded by shabiha thugs and i 'm afraid to be arrested or killed , " he told @entity77			0
the " shabiha " pro-regime militia , reportedly working alongside government forces , has been blamed by the opposition for attempting to stoke sectarian tensions in @entity1			1
and while @entity1 has traditionally been a place of religious tolerance , @entity7 expert @entity54 told @entity77 " there is a real sense now that that is changing and being manipulated by people on both sides " of the conflict			1
" the older sunni merchant class that feel the city is theirs rightfully are now turning on the @entity65 , who they see as these recent migrants that do n't actually belong in the city , " said @entity54			2
" @entity65 live on the outskirts ; they 're not seen as really part of the old city			0
they do n't fall within the old city boundaries , they 're recent migrants and [ some @entity218 ] are not very happy with them			0
" while certain elements of the @entity63 community would like to overthrow the @entity221 and retake what they see as their rightful place as leaders of @entity7 , @entity54 says the @entity65 community fears the prospect of persecution if the government falls			2
" the regime is trying to persuade the @entity65 that if they abandon the government , they will be wiped out in the dog - eat - dog aftermath , " he said			0
according to @entity54 , those who have spent the last 11 months protesting every day in @entity1 fear that " if they stop doing this , then they will be crushed			2
" @entity74 said he would like to stay in @entity1 if and when the uprising ends			0
" i hope @entity1 will be okay , " he said			0
" i hope in the future we 'll stand together in @entity1			0
" as the death count continues to rise and prospects for peace in the near future dims , @entity74 believes the war in @entity1 can only end one of two ways			0
" either we all die , " he said , " or we get victory at the end			0
