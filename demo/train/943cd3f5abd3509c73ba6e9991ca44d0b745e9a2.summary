-- it 's been a bad year for bad guys			0
twelve months ago , no one could have guessed that @entity5 's @entity4 , @entity7 's @entity6 and @entity9 's @entity8 would be dead ; @entity11 's former president @entity10 and @entity13 's former president @entity12 @entity12 prosecuted and former @entity15 army commander @entity14 in jail			0
further , @entity18 president @entity17 and @entity20 's president @entity19 are under intense pressure both internationally and within their own countries			0
top aide : @entity4 's ' suicidal ' flight to birthplace the @entity26 , that led to the fall of so many of the region 's leaders , sent shockwaves around the world , leaving major powers struggling to make sense of the changing landscape -- and ensure their interests are preserved			2
the dramatic events , followed by unrest in societies considered " dormant " in terms of traditional activism -- including @entity41 and @entity42 -- leave one curious to discover the " common denominator			0
" the obvious but unexpected answer is : people power , in all of these cases carried largely by non-partisan youth movements			1
much has been written on the revolutions driven by people power youth movements in @entity13 and @entity11			1
their unity , planning and nonviolent discipline has inspired the world and given more than 100 million people a chance to change from dictatorship to democracy			1
the revolutions inspired similar movements			2
now leaders of @entity61 , @entity62 , and even @entity63 are promising reforms			0
the government of @entity66 has emerged from its state of emergency after 19 years			0
@entity20 have risked , and sacrificed , their lives in peaceful demonstrations for freedom and democracy			0
let me also note my own country -- @entity74			0
people power and nonviolent struggle driven by @entity77 , the resistance movement , brought an end to the rule of @entity81 on october 5 , 2000			1
@entity77 -- which grew from 11 founders to 70,000 supporters over its two - year struggle -- is credited for stripping away the fear and passivity that keep a dictator 's subjects under oppression			2
during the presidential campaign of september 2000 , @entity77 launched its " gotov je " ( he 's finished ) and the " vreme je " ( it 's time ) campaigns , which galvanized national discontent with @entity81 and eventually resulted in his defeat			2
@entity77 became one of the defining symbols of the @entity99 struggle and his subsequent overthrow			0
@entity81 was delivered to @entity101 in 2001 , followed by former @entity74 leader @entity102 , then @entity14			0
this has enabled @entity74 to lift the burdens from the past and push towards @entity107 membership			0
@entity108 : worst @entity110 atrocity since @entity111 people power has been a phenomenon throughout history			1
it is credited with successes including @entity118 's independence movement , led by @entity119 , the battles against racism led by @entity122 and @entity123 , and the agitations of @entity126 activist @entity125 during the early stages of the @entity129 's downfall			0
policymakers often overlook the strategic value of supporting non-violent movements			1
fifty out of 67 transitions from dictatorships to democracies in the last 35 years came from non-violent struggle			2
armed intervention was not the driving force			1
the new book " why civil resistance works : the strategic @entity142 , " written by @entity143 and @entity144 , studies 323 violent and non-violent campaigns from 1900 to 2006			1
it finds nonviolent campaigns are more than twice as likely to succeed as violent campaigns			1
they also found non-violent uprisings are 10 times more likely to end in stable and durable democracies			2
the last year taught us an important lesson : what used to be called " realpolitik " is not actually " real " any more			0
there is a force more powerful at work shaping the new reality : strategic nonviolent struggle			1
consider what would happen if 1 % of the billions of dollars spent on foreign military interventions in @entity74 , @entity162 , @entity163 and , more recently , @entity5 , went to nonviolent pro-democracy movements			1
this could be done through education , the translation of books , movies and video clips , developing innovative uses for new media like @entity173 or @entity174 , and training in nonviolent , civic mobilization			0
rebuilding the ruins of @entity4 my organization , canvas , has worked with activists from more than 40 different countries -- and we have seen the power of such education at work in places including @entity189 , @entity190 , the @entity191 , @entity13 , @entity11 and @entity63			2
brave , young and oppressed people around the world are realizing there is immense power in nonviolent struggle			1
i know this , because they are calling me every day for help			0
we must recognize the power of nonviolent struggle in promoting what some call the " fourth wave of democratization			0
" we should commit these kinds of resources to show we have learnt the most important lesson from these revolutionary months			1
that would mark 2011 as more than the " worst year for bad guys , " but encourage and remind millions of oppressed in places like @entity7 , @entity63 , @entity211 and @entity212 that power ultimately belongs to the people			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity217			1

@entity217 says people power was the driving force behind the falls of dictator regimes
he says policymakers often overlook the strategic value of supporting non-violent movements
@entity217 says the world should commit resources away from violent campaigns into non-violent pro-democracy movements
