-- @entity1 , 69 , loved the ocean			2
last july , she was diagnosed with cancer and had only a few months to live			2
@entity1 knew her last footprint had to be a green one , and she started looking into eco-friendly alternatives to traditional burial			1
@entity1 , 69 , had her remains memorialized on an offshore reef			1
the concept of " going green " has taken new life in the death care industry as eco-minded companies tap into the needs of those like @entity1			1
from biodegradable caskets to natural burial sites , death is becoming less of a dark matter than a green one			1
@entity1 , an avid scuba diver , chose an eco-friendly company that would combine her cremated remains to form an artificial memorial reef			1
" she loved the idea of always being in the water as an alternative to being cremated and scattered , " said her daughter @entity25			2
dying is arguably the most natural phenomenon in the world , but modern death rituals -- embalming with formaldehyde - based solutions and traditional burial in concrete vaults -- are not nature - friendly , according to environmentalists			1
along with its dead , the @entity39 buries 1.6 million tons of reinforced concrete , 827,060 tons of toxic embalming fluid , 90,000 tons of steel ( from caskets ) , and 30 million tons of hardwood board each year , according to the @entity45 , an independent nonprofit organization based in @entity46 , @entity47			1
" we can rebuild the @entity52 with that amount of metal , " said @entity48 , the council 's executive director			2
" the amount of concrete is enough to build a two - lane highway from @entity58 to @entity59			1
" @entity60 established a burgeoning network of death - care providers that have earned a green thumbs - up in the council 's eco-certification program , the first of its kind in the industry			1
" we want to reduce carbon emissions , waste and toxins in the death care industry and utilize burial to steward natural areas in the @entity39 , " said @entity60			1
among the certified eco-providers is @entity76 , based in @entity77 , @entity78			1
" we 're the surf and turf of natural burial , " said @entity79 , ceo of @entity76			1
the company takes the green movement to sea level by offering a living legacy in the form of underwater reefs used to create new marine habitats for fish and other sea life			1
the artificial reefs are cast from a mixture of environmentally safe cement and cremated remains			2
@entity76 was the logical choice for @entity1 , who died on november 3			1
" she liked the idea of being a home for fish , " said her daughter			2
this month , @entity1 will travel to @entity102 to see her mother 's reef lowered off the coast of @entity106			1
other families will join her , wearing shorts and t - shirts instead of dark suits and dresses			0
they will have a chance to decorate the reefs with flowers and other sea - friendly mementos			0
a brass plaque will help @entity1 identify her mother 's reef			2
she intends to visit the underwater memorial by scuba diving there in the future			0
" these reefs will be covered up with sea life in a very short period of time , so they make a significant contribution , " @entity79 said			0
the reefs last about 500 years , and so far about 300 have been dropped off the coasts of @entity102 , @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			1
another eco-provider certified by the @entity45 is @entity136 - based @entity135 , which allows its customers to design their own 100 percent biodegradable coffins , made from 90 percent recycled grid honeycomb cardboard			0
the company says the coffins release 72 percent less carbon monoxide in the cremation process compared to a traditional coffin			0
" we are appealing to customers to make the responsible choice , " said @entity145 , founder and director of @entity135			0
" the fact that standard chipboard is full of resins and formaldehyde , which is either released into the earth when buried or as emissions when burnt , is really unknown to the general public			2
" the vibrant coffins have even captured some attention in @entity159			0
they have a cameo as props in the upcoming film " @entity164			0
" an eco-friendly funeral can also help conserve land and protect it from development			0
the @entity169 is working with the @entity45 to become the first state - park agency to offer cremation - based green burials			1
the funds raised from the services will be used to acquire new state park lands			0
" we want burials to be more sustainable for the planet , more meaningful for the planet and economically viable for the provider , " said @entity60			0
" we do n't want this to be a marketing gimmick that diminishes the social and ecological benefits of this concept , " he emphasized			0
the death care industry , like others , has its share of green hype			1
while it might be a bit macabre for some , @entity188 sells eclectic couches made out of used coffins			0
founder @entity193 buys unwanted or slightly damaged coffins from funeral homes that would otherwise go to a landfill			0
from these discarded materials , @entity193 designs artsy @entity199 couches you might see in a music video or a tattoo parlor			0
@entity193 's clientele includes musicians , actors and others who can afford $ 3,500 for a couch			0
hype or no hype , the decision is a personal one that ultimately rests with an individual or family			0
@entity60 emphasizes that the @entity45 is careful not to diminish anyone 's choices or make recommendations about the greenest way to go			0
" there are shades of green and people can distinguish one shade from another , " he said .			2

eco-minded companies in death care industry offer " green " funerals

ceo of @entity76 : " we 're the surf and turf of natural burial . "
