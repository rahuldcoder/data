-- for @entity3 , the significance of wednesday 's hate crimes legislation can be traced to a single punch outside a bar on a drunken night two years ago			1
" my son was murdered as he was leaving a bar in @entity13 , @entity14 , " the 48 - year - old woman told @entity0 about her son , @entity7 , who was 20 when he came face - to - face with what she calls a hate crime			1
" he walked outside the bar and there was three people sitting in a car outside and they called him over to ask him for a cigarette			2
" it was 3:45 a.m. on may 16 , 2007 , and her underage son was legally drunk , but not so much that he could n't give them the cigarette			2
he did so , then turned to walk away			0
he did not get far , she said			0
" as he was walking away , the guy in the back seat got out and walked over to @entity7 and called him a faggot and punched him in the face			1
" the men got back into their car and drove off , leaving @entity7 on the ground , his brain separated from his brain stem , she said			0
fifteen minutes later , the 18 - year - old assailant called one of the women whom @entity7 had been with in the bar and left a message on her cell phone			2
" you tell your faggot friend when he wakes up he owes me 500 dollars for my broken hand , " the message said			2
@entity7 was taken to @entity47 , where he was pronounced brain dead 17 hours later			0
more than 700 people showed up at his memorial service at @entity51 in nearby @entity52			0
two days later , @entity53 , then 18 , was charged with murder			0
he bargained it down to involuntary manslaughter and served 199 days in the county lockup followed by 12 months in prison , @entity3 said			1
@entity53 was released on probation last july , she said			0
an attempt to reach the @entity53 family tuesday was not successful			0
had hate crimes been a federal offense in 2007 , the @entity64 would have been able to investigate the attack , and @entity69 's killer might still be in prison , his mother said			1
for the past 27 months , @entity3 has logged 76,000 miles speaking at colleges and clubs across the country trying to raise awareness and gather support for the legislation			1
last week , the @entity78 did what she was seeking when it passed legislation by 68 - 29 that would make it a federal crime to assault an individual because of his or her sexual orientation or gender identity			1
@entity85 is to sign the measure , which was added to a $ 680 billion defense authorization bill , on wednesday			1
@entity3 and her husband were driving tuesday night from their home in @entity13 to the nation 's capital , where they were planning to witness the ceremony			1
" we are going there representing so many people , " she said			0
" people who have been murdered and are dealing with the harassment and bullying and violence on a daily basis			0
" but @entity3 said her work does not end with the president 's signature			1
" this is a huge milestone , but it is not the end of the fight , " she said			0
" we have to change the hearts and minds			0
" toward that end , she has spoken at 34 colleges and universities " to educate these kids about what hate and violence and bullying can do and give them options and teach them non-violent conflict resolution			2
" but she expressed frustration that elementary schools have not allowed her to address their students , to send them the message that ends each of her talks : " no mother should ever have to bury her child , no mother should ever have to lose her child to hate or violence and no mother should ever have to fight for justice for her child			2
" the measure is named for @entity138 , a gay @entity140 teenager who died after being kidnapped and severely beaten in october 1998 , and @entity141 , an @entity142 man dragged to his death in @entity144 the same year			2
several religious groups have expressed concern that a hate - crimes law could be used to criminalize conservative speech relating to subjects such as abortion or homosexuality			1
but attorney general @entity152 has said that any federal hate - crimes law would be used only to prosecute violent acts based on bias , as opposed to the prosecution of speech based on controversial racial or religious beliefs			1
former president @entity159 had threatened to veto a similar measure			0
opponents of the expanded hate crimes bill challenged the need to specify one particular community in federal legislation			1
they contended that existing federal hate - crimes laws were sufficient to protect the rights of people based on sexual orientation and gender identity			0
more than 77,000 hate crime incidents were reported by the @entity64 between 1998 and 2007 , or " nearly one hate crime for every hour of every day over the span of a decade , " @entity152 told the @entity174 in june .			1

@entity3 says her son was called a " faggot " and then punched -- he died after assault
for the past 27 months , she 's been *tirelessly* *lobbying* for hate crime legislation
she will attend president @entity85 's signing ceremony on wednesday
several groups concerned law could be used to criminalize conservative speech
