@entity0 -- @entity3 congressional leaders wednesday demanded @entity4 join them in condemning a spate of threats and vandalism that has followed sunday 's vote on a sweeping overhaul of the @entity11 health care system			1
more than 10 @entity14 have reported trouble since the weekend vote , @entity13 majority leader @entity12 told reporters			1
windows have been smashed at @entity3 offices in at least three states , and federal agents were investigating whether a cut gas line at the home of a @entity26 congressman 's brother was related to the lawmaker 's yes vote			1
democracy " is not about violence , " @entity12 said at a news conference with @entity31 rep. @entity30 , the no. 3 @entity32 in the @entity13			1
" both of us believe that to remain silent in the face of such activity gives the impression of either condoning or sanctioning such actions , " added @entity12 , @entity35			1
the top @entity4 in the @entity13 , minority leader @entity41 , told reporters that he has urged opponents to demonstrate legally			1
" i 've made statements that i understand people are angry , but violence and threats are inappropriate and irresponsible , " the @entity45 congressman said			2
" if people are angry , they ought to register to vote and get involved in a campaign			2
" the white - hot rhetoric that dominated the last several months of debate on the historic health care bill culminated in unruly protests by the @entity58 movement at the @entity59 over the weekend			2
three @entity14 , including civil rights leader rep. @entity60 of @entity61 , reported protesters shouted racial slurs at them and spit at one of them , while rep. @entity64 , @entity65 , an openly gay @entity13 member , had anti-gay slurs yelled at him			1
one @entity13 member mentioned a map on the @entity71 page of former @entity4 vice presidential candidate @entity72 during a wednesday meeting on safety concerns , a @entity3 source said			1
the map shows 20 @entity13 @entity3 political targets believed to be vulnerable in the upcoming midterm elections -- some have already announced their retirements			1
their home districts are marked with cross hairs			2
mention of the map brought audible groans to the room , the source said			0
@entity4 @entity13 members encouraged protesters outside and inside the @entity13 gallery , some of whom carried messages like " vote no or else " or " if @entity92 wo n't stop it , a @entity91 will " -- a reference to newly elected @entity65 sen. @entity92 accompanied by a silhouette of a pistol			1
since the vote , an @entity98 blogger has launched a " window war " against @entity14 and has kept a tally of the recent incidents of damage , including ones in @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			1
a message left for @entity110 democrat @entity109 , whose last - minute decision to support the bill helped give @entity14 the votes it needed to pass , warned that " there are millions of people across the country who wish you ill , and all of those thoughts projected on you will materialize into something that 's not very good for you			1
" @entity30 , who is @entity125 , said he has received a fax in his office with a picture of a noose drawn on it and had threatening telephone calls at his home			0
@entity132 : ' a very dangerous time for @entity133 ' " we 're giving aid and comfort to these people , and this stuff gets ratcheted up , " @entity30 told @entity1			0
" we in this @entity139 have got to come together in a bipartisan way and tamp this foolishness down			0
it does n't make sense			0
that 's not what a democracy is all about			2
" @entity12 told a news conference that " a significant number , meaning over 10 " lawmakers had reported either threats , vandalism or other incidents			1
@entity59 police officials have briefed @entity13 @entity14 on reporting suspicious or threatening activity and taking precautions to avoid " subjecting themselves or their families to physical harm , " he said			1
rep. @entity159 , @entity160 - @entity104 , said her @entity162 district office had a brick thrown through one of its windows and a message that referred to " snipers " was left on one of her campaign offices			0
in a written statement , she said @entity4 leaders have been " fanning the flames with coded rhetoric			0
" and @entity35 rep. @entity176 blamed republicans for encouraging heated rhetoric over the bill			0
" there 's a real feeling that some of the comments from the @entity4 leaders and @entity4 are not tamping down the fire , they are throwing fuel on the fire			2
and that is totally inappropriate , " @entity176 said			0
but @entity41 , who compared the legislation 's passage to " @entity191 , " said @entity14 had not complained to him that @entity4 have n't been quick enough to condemn the threats and vandalism			1
@entity30 said his wife has forwarded the phone numbers from the calls to law enforcement agencies			0
@entity159 said federal agents and local authorities were investigating the threat and vandalism at her offices			0
and in @entity26 , @entity206 fire marshals and the @entity207 are looking into the slashing of a propane gas line outside the home of rep. @entity212 's brother , the congressman 's office said			1
a @entity212 aide told @entity1 that a line to the propane tank on the brother 's gas grill had been severed after the brother 's home address was posted online by a @entity58 activist			1
@entity221 , a spokesman for the fire marshal 's office , said the incident " did not involve an immediate threat to occupants of the residence " but would disclose no details			2
the county joined the investigation late tuesday after a request from the @entity207 , @entity229 said			0
" officials are taking the incident very seriously and conducting a vigorous investigation , " he said			0
conservative talk show host @entity237 told his radio audience monday that @entity14 who supported the bill would be remembered as " an enemy of the republic " and " an enemy to the @entity245			1
" but he urged viewers of his @entity248 television show wednesday to avoid violence , because " radical " supporters of the @entity133 administration are counting on such attacks to discredit their opposition , he said			0
" not only is it completely nuts and wrong , it 's exactly what they want , " @entity237 said			2
he told viewers , " they are begging for it			0
you are being set up			0
" but in @entity106 , democrats in @entity262 are seeking to raise money over a brick thrown through the window of the party headquarters			0
" at first , we thought our office was just the object of a random act of bitter violence , but now we know that 's not the case , " said the @entity268 's web site			2
" this attack was instigated , encouraged and directed by an ultra-right wing blogger and similar events occurred all over the country			0
" the web site item asked for donations to " help us get back to work			0
" @entity1 's @entity282 , @entity283 , @entity284 and @entity285 contributed to this report .			2
