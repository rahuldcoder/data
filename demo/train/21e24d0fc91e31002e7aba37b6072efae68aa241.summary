-- while @entity1 faces many big issues -- unrest in the @entity4 , the effects of climate change , uneven economic growth , growing income inequality , a costly and less than optimal health care system and more -- the contest to control the @entity11 and @entity12 does not really seem to be turning into a defining struggle over the national agenda			0
clearly the 2014 midterm elections are n't generating much excitement on the hustings			0
according to @entity19 , voter enthusiasm is down significantly since 2010			0
@entity20 are more enthused than @entity21 , according to @entity19 , but neither party is doing very well			1
given that many of the key races in competitive states might come down to a small percentage of voters , as is usually the case in midterms , enthusiasm and its impact on turnout can be decisive on @entity33			0
this election wo n't be like 1994 , when @entity20 took control of @entity36 with a rightward push , or 2006 , when @entity21 did the same with campaigns to move beyond president @entity40 's conservatism			1
in those midterm elections , voters were mobilized as people came to believe that the collective outcome of the races offered a huge opportunity for their parties			0
@entity48 's midterm malaise why do so many people seem to be sleepwalking through these races ? part of the problem has to do with the fact that neither party is in great shape			1
democrats and @entity20 face fundamental internal challenges going into november , big long - term problems that have significantly dampened much of the enthusiasm on each side			1
for @entity20 , the vice remains political extremism			2
over the past six years , republicans have been dragged down by the actions of congressional @entity20 associated with the right wing , the @entity53 faction			1
as @entity62 were pushed further to the right and the party embraced an extraordinarily ruthless approach to handling the challenges of governance -- willing to take measures such as threatening to throw the nation into default over budget disputes -- the party 's popularity has plummeted			0
republicans were forced to devote an extraordinary amount of their time and energy during this year 's primaries to navigating through an intraparty battle between tea party and establishment factions who were vying to face off against @entity21			1
@entity20 fight for 2014 's early voters for tea party @entity20 , the problem is a leadership that has become too embedded in @entity91 , too comfortable with the political status quo			1
for other @entity20 , the tea party is the problem : they have dragged down the reputation of their party , making it seem incapable of leadership , decision - making or rational deliberation			1
the struggles within the @entity20 are so severe that it is difficult for @entity20 voters to perceive november to be a great rallying moment for candidates and their party			1
they just want to secure control of the @entity12 , more focused on what they are against , namely president @entity48 , rather than what they are for			2
there has been some evidence in recent days that @entity20 candidates are finding themselves under pressure in states such as @entity116 and @entity117 , where victory should have been a slam dunk			2
democrats are doing even worse than the @entity20 when it comes to enthusiasm			2
president @entity48 has become the problem as he finds himself in a similar position to president @entity40			2
@entity21 candidates are struggling to figure out how far they need to go in disassociating themselves with the president of their own party			1
@entity131 : @entity11 blames @entity132 , not its own faults for many liberals , president @entity48 has failed to deliver on key promises from 2008 , ranging from measures to combat climate change to liberalized immigration rules and dealing with the growing problem of economic inequality			2
president @entity48 has done a lot of talking , but he has not been as successful at achieving his goals			0
and he has not displayed the aggressive political style that many on the left believe is needed to counteract fierce @entity20 opposition			0
for moderates and independents , there is growing unease and discomfort with the way in which @entity48 has handled the implementation of health care , the problems with the economy and the response to the growth of @entity159			2
some of these criticisms have come to the forefront with the recent publication of @entity132 's book , " @entity164 , " in which he charges the president had been too passive in handling foreign policy			0
former sen. and secretary of the interior @entity168 said to the @entity170 that first - term sen. @entity171 could only win if he demonstrates to voters that he stands for " the @entity175 way , not the @entity48 way or the @entity21 way			1
" given that so many prominent democrats are focused on separating themselves from the president from their own party , rather than proudly running on his record , it makes it difficult to rally around a platform and agenda			0
there are some factors that the parties ca n't control			0
everyone these days seems disgusted with @entity91 , so it 's difficult for people to be enthusiastic that anything will break through the gridlock			0
the improvement in the economy also makes it harder for both parties to rally the troops than in 2010 , when the recession generated more anger and zeal about the elections			0
but there are some problems the parties can try to address			0
democrats and @entity20 who are getting ready to launch a candidacy for the 2016 election should be paying close attention and thinking hard about how they can move their respective parties beyond this state of affairs			1
effective @entity20 candidates need to prove that they will make their party a serious governing force in @entity91			1
democrats will need to show , without creating so much distance from the president that they simply offer fodder to their @entity20 critics , that they can greatly improve upon and transcend what @entity48 has accomplished			1
until then , most voters will have difficulty believing that either party is capable of moving government in a new direction and solving the problems that confront the nation .			0

polls show voters are not caught up in the election , with @entity21 even less enthusiastic
@entity235 says @entity20 voters must deal with split between moderates and tea party faction
democrats are struggling with how to *dissociate* themselves from *unpopular* @entity48 policies , he says
@entity235 : candidates for 2016 have to decide how to try to transcend these struggles
