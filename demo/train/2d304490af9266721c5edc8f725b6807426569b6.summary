-- former naval aviator @entity1 was just 24 when his life literally took a dive			1
@entity1 was piloting a @entity4 on a training mission 20 miles east of @entity6 , @entity7 , more than 37 years ago when his light attack aircraft collided with another plane at 15,000 feet , sending his jet spiraling into the @entity11			1
@entity1 ejected safely from the cockpit ; his plane sank to the bottom of the ocean			1
the other plane limped back to base			2
this month , @entity19 's past caught up with the present as divers found his wreckage , and the story can now be written about the people who recently found it and @entity1 's reaction			1
see photos of the wreckage it was mid-morning on december 2 , the first monday after @entity30 in 1974			1
) @entity1 and three other @entity33 pilots had taken off from @entity34 about 10 miles from @entity35			1
they were rolling their aircraft and doing simulated bombing runs			2
he estimates they were flying at 300 to 350 knots ( 345 to 402 mph )			2
by his own admission , @entity1 said he got too close to the plane piloted by his commanding officer , @entity42			1
@entity43 , a former @entity44			2
" the event is burned in my brain , " @entity1 , 62 , a retired rear admiral who served 30 years in the @entity54 , said by phone this week from @entity46 , @entity47 , where he now teaches aviation maintenance technology at @entity50			1
" it was gray and rainy , not a nice day to be sitting in the ocean , " laughed @entity1 in an obvious understatement			1
" i was literally bobbing like a cork in a tiny raft			2
" @entity1 remembers ejecting and free - falling for a couple thousand feet before his parachute opened automatically			1
he said he was floating in water with an air temperature of about 40 degrees " shooting off pencil flares " to get the attention of a nearby helicopter			2
" absolutely unbelievable , " he said thinking back after he was pulled to safety			0
a newspaper article at the time from the @entity69 reported , " the helicopter was operating in the area on a routine water indoctrination flight			0
" as luck would have it , that helicopter crew was trained in search and rescue			0
an accident investigation board was convened by the @entity54 to determine the cause of the collision , but @entity1 knew who was to blame			1
it was entirely my fault , " he said humbly			0
" truthfully , i got a little disoriented			0
i thought ' @entity84 , ' it would be close			0
the planes were in a climb			0
i heard a huge bang			0
my airplane almost immediately went out of control , lost hydraulics			0
" the vertical tail of his jet was broken off			0
@entity1 , the oldest of nine siblings , said he never really focused on what happened to his plane once he saw it disappear below the clouds , but over the years , he 's never forgotten			1
" the memories have never left , " he reflected			0
it 's likely not something @entity102 is ever going to forget either			0
@entity102 , who at 31 is half the age of @entity19 , is the man who found @entity1 's plane by accident this month			1
@entity102 is the executive director of @entity106 ( think it sink it reef it ) , a @entity35 - based company in the business of building artificial reefs and environmental conservation			1
@entity102 and his team of divers -- @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117 -- were mapping the sea floor 20 miles off the coast of @entity6 , when they spotted wreckage 80 feet down in the @entity11			1
bringing closure to relatives of those killed in 1952 @entity126 crash they took photos and launched their own investigation in hopes of identifying the aircraft			0
" by a stroke of luck , " @entity102 said , he found a key part			2
it was what appeared to be a small flat part riveted to another piece			0
he brought it to the surface , removed years of growth and discovered a data plate			0
@entity106 supporter @entity144 used the documentation to identify the aircraft and find @entity19			0
" it 's a great feeling			0
this endeavor was very much worthwhile			0
much effort was spent on searching the actual site and researching with no promise of finding any results , " @entity102 said			0
" due to much luck and perhaps insistence , we were able to locate the right components that lead us to the identification			0
to actually be able to solve the riddle of this aircraft wreckage is quite gratifying			2
" for @entity19 , who went on to earn two @entity166 awards and the @entity167 in @entity168 and whose career included duty as commanding officer of the aircraft carrier @entity173 , the collision nearly four decades ago and the recent discovery of his plane have brought back memories and another opportunity for a teachable moment			2
" i was fortunate to grow up in a @entity54 system that accommodated some human error , " @entity1 reflected			1
" i had a lot of people that gave me another chance			0
" @entity1 acknowledged he has a greater appreciation for the errors he made , and it helps bring a " little more understanding when my juniors and people who work for me make mistakes			1
" " burying it would n't do much good , " @entity1 said			1
but good is exactly what became of the actual wreckage still partially buried in the sand			2
" what i am probably most excited about is ( to ) be able to tell / show @entity1 how this wreckage is a productive reef ecosystem today and probably has been for some time , " @entity102 said			1
" a very positive outcome today because of the unfortunate accident years ago			2

@entity1 was a young @entity54 flyer when his plane collided with another
he was rescued from the @entity11 after the 1974 *incident* ; the plane sank

now the wreckage is " a productive reef ecosystem , " says the man who found it
