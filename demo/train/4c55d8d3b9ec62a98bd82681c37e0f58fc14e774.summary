@entity0 -- two unconnected overseas emergencies -- the @entity4 outbreak in @entity5 and @entity7 terrorists in @entity8 and @entity9 -- are prompting president @entity10 to embark on a two - day @entity12 road trip that the @entity13 hopes will demonstrate a commander at work			1
the spread of @entity4 in @entity5 , which has n't slowed despite $ 100 million of pledged @entity12 aid , is unrelated to the @entity12 mission to degrade @entity20 terrorists in @entity8 and @entity9			1
but both have prompted worry among @entity12 about their personal safety and led to charges the @entity13 is n't doing enough to combat the hazards			1
the dual foreign plagues have yet to pose an immediate threat to the @entity12 homeland , the @entity13 says , though each has claimed the lives of @entity12 abroad			1
and officials say both @entity4 and @entity20 could grow to become unmanageable problems if action is n't taken now to stamp them out			2
@entity10 's trip , which begins tuesday , will take him to the @entity35 headquarters of the @entity36 , and later to the @entity37 at the @entity38 in @entity39			1
the president 's stop tuesday at the @entity36 comes amid loudening criticism from health experts on the global response to the @entity4 outbreak in @entity5 , where almost 2,500 people have died			1
at the @entity12 public health agency @entity10 will be briefed on the outbreak and speak to officials there about how the @entity12 is responding			2
afterwards he 's likely to announce new @entity12 commitments in combating the virus ' spread , the @entity13 said monday			2
though officials would not specify how the @entity12 may increase its response , steps @entity10 could announce include sending more medical equipment and @entity12 doctors and nurses to combat the virus , and ramping up training for local medical teams			2
the @entity62 may also be asked to increase its support in handling logistics of the large - scale response already underway , which involves multiple countries and aid groups			0
epidemiologists and others who are monitoring the disease have claimed developed countries are n't sending enough resources to the three nations most affected : @entity74 , @entity75 and @entity76			0
the @entity12 has committed more than $ 100 million in the effort to combat @entity4 , according to the @entity78 , and @entity10 plans to call on @entity79 to approve an additional $ 88 million as part of a bill to fund the federal government			1
last week @entity78 said it would spend $ 75 million to build treatment facilities and supply them with medical equipment			0
but so far the @entity12 aid has been unable to stop the spread of the deadly virus , which @entity10 and @entity13 officials are calling a national security problem			1
particularly concerning , @entity12 officials say , is the potential for instability in the countries where @entity4 is rampant and the possibility for the virus to mutate into a more dangerous form			2
@entity4 currently only transmits though contact with bodily fluids ; a mutation that allows the virus to spread through the air would pose a catastrophic threat to human populations worldwide , health experts say			0
speaking monday , @entity13 press secretary @entity102 said there was still a " very low " likelihood the ebola virus could mutate in a way that poses a threat to the @entity12			2
" right now , the risk of an @entity4 outbreak in the @entity12 is very low , but that risk would only increase if there were not a robust response on the part of the @entity12 , " @entity102 said			0
the potential for increased risk to the @entity12 homeland has also inspired the more robust response to @entity20 terrorists , who @entity10 announced last week would be the target of an air campaign inside @entity8 and @entity9			1
that mission is run from @entity37 in @entity39 , where @entity10 will receive a briefing on battle plans wednesday			0
the @entity13 said the president would also visit servicemen and women during his stop at the facility			0
@entity10 and his aides maintain that @entity20 fighters do n't currently pose a direct threat to the @entity12 homeland but warn of the potential for militants with @entity12 or @entity135 passports to return home and stage an attack remains a top concern			1
secretary of state @entity139 has been engaging @entity141 and @entity142 nations in building a coalition to fight @entity20 , though levels of commitment from foreign partners has remained vague			0
" we 're pleased with the level of conversations that we 're having with these governments and their willingness to contribute in a tangible , important way to this broader effort , " @entity102 said monday			0
" we 'll have some announcements to make in terms of what sort of cooperation and involvement and commitment that we have from the international community			0
and based on the tenor and tone of the kinds of private conversations that are underway right now , we expect those commitments to be substantial			0

@entity10 hits road tuesday for briefings at @entity36 and @entity37
@entity13 facing unconnected @entity4 and @entity20 crises
if left *unattended* , both could present risks to @entity12 homeland
