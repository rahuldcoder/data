-- economic inequality is now center stage in the global debate , and the @entity4 asserts that this issue is the single biggest risk facing the planet			2
yet , amid all the justifiable concern , we may be on the cusp of a " game - changing " point in history			0
@entity15 research indicates that , for the first time in about 200 years , overall global income inequality ( one of the key measures of economic inequality ) appears to be going into reverse			1
this is a cause for optimism , and will be a key topic discussed at the 50th @entity26 summit of developing nations in @entity28 this weekend			1
the meeting , which the @entity26 is co-hosting with @entity30 , has the overriding ambition of promoting a " more equitable world order			1
" the powerful forces that determine the overall global income landscape are complex and cross-cutting			1
chief among them are growing income equality between countries , as the global " @entity40 " ( @entity41 , @entity42 , the @entity43 and @entity44 ) develops , at the same time that there is increased income inequality within many nations			1
these opposing mega-trends , like tectonic plates , are pushing against each other			0
@entity30 and @entity51 have been key in promoting greater global income inequality between nations			1
combining their recent economic growth , and very large collective populations ( estimated at more than 2.5 billion people ) , both have lifted a massive amount of people out of poverty -- an estimated 600 million between 1981 and 2004 in @entity30 alone			0
and it has helped catalyze what @entity63 , former lead economist of the @entity15 's @entity64 , has described as the " profoundest reshuffle of individual incomes on the global scale since the @entity69			2
" but at the same time , there is a more pernicious , countervailing mega-trend : growing income inequality within many countries across both the developed and the developing world			1
this issue has become increasingly politically important , especially since the international financial crisis in 2008 - 09			0
taken overall , the interplay of these forces over the past 200 years has resulted in greater global income equality			1
however , in the period since 2002 , something dramatic may be on the change			0
there is evidence that the " positive effect " of growing income equality between countries , driven by the development of the @entity40 , is superseding the " negative effect " of increasing inequality within nations			1
if true , this would be a momentous moment in world history			0
as the @entity15 itself says , this conclusion is hedged with uncertainty as data sources on income across the world are inevitably incomplete and imperfect			2
so more evidence , over a longer period , is needed to judge whether the process is real , robust and sustainable			0
what is certain , however , is that there has been a transformation in the overall fortunes of the @entity40			2
the most prominent beneficiaries have been a much heralded " new " middle class -- estimated to be as large as a third of the world 's population -- disproportionately located in key @entity44 emerging economies like @entity30 , @entity51 and @entity113			0
also welcome news is @entity15 research indicating that much of the bottom third of the global income pyramid has generally benefited too			2
as in @entity30 , many other hundreds of millions of people across the @entity40 have transitioned away from absolute poverty			0
elites within emerging markets have also tended to prosper			0
many of these people are part of the top global 1 - 5 % of income earners ( a group which is otherwise dominated by individuals in developed countries )			0
this strata , at the very apex of the global income hierarchy , have generally seen their incomes rise massively in recent years			2
unfortunately , however , not everyone in the @entity40 has shared fully in this rising tide of prosperity			1
much of @entity41 , and some of @entity42 , for instance , has generally not benefited nearly as much as @entity44 , at least to date			0
a key question on the minds of @entity26 leaders at this weekend 's summit is whether the development of the @entity40 has enough momentum to continue driving forwards a more equitable world order			1
this will depend on whether the high economic growth of emerging markets persists , and also whether the trend toward rising income inequality within countries can be slowed or arrested			1
on the former , there is no inevitability to ever - growing income inequality within countries			2
growing discontent in many nations means the political and popular will to address this issue is growing , but the debate over what long - term reform agenda is needed divides the left and right			0
on the latter , the trajectory of the global economy will continue to shift toward the @entity40			2
however , the remarkable wave of emerging market growth of recent years will decelerate , and the global transformation it has produced -- an economic change of unprecedented speed and scale in world history -- is unlikely to be repeated again			0
as the @entity26 meets , the world therefore stands at a historic crossroads , which could potentially see the first sustained period of greater overall global income equality since the @entity69			1
but if emerging market growth decelerates faster than anticipated , or income inequality within countries accelerates , this process could go into reverse			1
if so , the political salience of the inequality agenda could skyrocket yet again across much of the globe .			0
