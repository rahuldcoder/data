@entity0 -- @entity3 troops routinely face the threat of roadside bombs while fighting insurgencies in @entity7			1
they need the most protective clothing the market can bear , and they 're getting it -- for now			2
@entity10 of @entity11 tests the flammability of different materials at this facility			1
back home , a battle is brewing in @entity17 over the next lucrative contract for military uniforms			1
the issue boils down to the raw fiber used in their construction			2
current uniforms are made in the @entity3 , in @entity25 , using a fabric called defender m made by the @entity29 company			1
it is favored by the military for its fire - resistant and breathable properties			1
but the fabric is made with a type of rayon imported from @entity37 , which normally would violate the military 's buy - @entity3 requirement			1
this specific rayon can not be produced in the @entity3 for environmental reasons , so @entity17 passed an amendment allowing it to be temporarily imported			1
the extension expires , or " sunsets , " in 2013 , but that year 's defense budget is being determined now			0
the idea of the sunset is to give @entity3 manufacturers time to come up with a comparable product			1
at stake : a defense contract worth hundreds of millions of dollars			0
@entity3 competitors have submitted alternatives , but after independent testing at @entity10 of @entity11 , the @entity54 concluded that @entity29 's @entity56 -- with its foreign - made fibers -- is the most flame - resistant			1
dr. @entity59 , who specializes in clothing flammability at the @entity61 , conducted a demonstration for @entity1			0
based on his testing , the @entity63 says defender @entity56 resists fire the longest of other fabrics			1
" what the new heat - resistant materials are able to do is add seconds of protection , so that seconds of protection can be the difference between a severe burn or a survival burn , " @entity59 said			1
" life and death , " echoes sen. @entity76 , @entity25 , regarding those extra seconds of fire protection			1
he asked the @entity79 to extend the waiver			0
" so long as it 's the best available in the world to protect our soldiers , we absolutely ought to maximize the use , " @entity76 told @entity1			0
" there is no @entity3 competitor that can meet or exceed it , " @entity76 said on the @entity79 floor			1
" obviously if there were , then that waiver would go away			0
" the @entity63 's uniform procurer says soldiers prefer @entity29 's product			1
" they have consistently exceeded our expectations			0
this has proven to be a valuable fabric and well - received by our soldiers , " @entity97 told @entity1			2
in a letter to @entity1 , a top military official said the ability to procure the foreign rayon " a valuable authority			2
" " our periodic review of rayon requirements within the @entity112 and testing of alternative items that are available domestically continue to support the determination that satisfactory quality and sufficient quantity of rayon yarn conforming to the domestic source requirements can not be procured as needed , " wrote @entity105 , undersecretary of defense for acquisition , technology & logistics			2
sen. @entity120 , @entity122 - @entity121 , opposed @entity76 's amendment , debating on the @entity79 floor that it " permanently extends this waiver and will end all efforts to produce a domestic material to make military uniforms			1
" sen. @entity130 , @entity131 , agrees with @entity120 that @entity3 companies wo n't have an incentive to invest in research and development			2
he says the exception was supposed to be temporary , and " favors foreign suppliers of rayon over our own @entity3 companies			1
" he argued on the @entity79 floor that in due time , @entity3 companies would be able to demonstrate an ability to manufacture materials that meet @entity63 requirements			2
he 's also worried about jobs			0
" some companies , like @entity147 , for example , have already lost hundreds of jobs owing to their inability to compete for @entity63 contracts , " he said			0
the @entity79 voted , and the nays had it			0
no extension , no more imports of this fabric as of 2013			2
what next ? the @entity155 is expected to take up the bill when members return from the august recess			0
@entity76 is confident his argument will prevail			0
" facts are stubborn things			0
i think when the facts get out they 'll understand it 's the right thing to do			0
our armed forces want it and it 's the best thing for our soldiers , " he said			0
