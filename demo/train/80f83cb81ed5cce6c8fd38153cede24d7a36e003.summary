-- the gruesome images are clear			2
there 's little doubt @entity4 suffered a chemical attack last month			1
but videos of the aftermath -- including 13 shown to @entity8 -- do nothing to show who was responsible			2
president @entity11 says he has " high confidence " that the regime is to blame -- the strongest position short of confirmation			1
but his administration has not released hard evidence			1
secretary of state @entity18 says declassifying any more information could endanger " sources and methods " of @entity24 intelligence gathering			1
@entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 also blame @entity4 president @entity28 for the horror in a @entity31 suburb last month			2
still , as @entity11 engages in a full - court press to build @entity24 support for strikes , some @entity24 hear echoes of a different basketball analogy : " slam dunk			1
" that 's how then - cia director @entity39 described what turned out to be flawed intelligence that @entity42 had weapons of mass destruction in the run - up to the war 10 years ago			2
@entity18 and defense secretary @entity47 were senators at the time			1
" we are especially sensitive , @entity50 , to never again asking any member of @entity8 to take a vote on faulty intelligence			2
and that is why our intelligence community has scrubbed and re-scrubbed the evidence , " @entity18 told @entity8			1
" the administration is asking us to go to war on the basis of a four - page document and a 12 - page document and none of the underlying evidence , " rep. @entity58 , @entity59 , complained on @entity0 's @entity60 saturday			1
" they have evidence showing the regime has probably the responsibility for the attacks			1
they have n't linked it directly to @entity28 , in my estimation , " rep. @entity73 , @entity74 , told @entity0 's @entity75 sunday			2
beyond a reasonable doubt or no ? @entity24 says both @entity80 chief of staff @entity79 said the intelligence passes a " common sense test			1
" " now , do we have a picture or do we have irrefutable , beyond a reasonable doubt evidence ? this is not a court of law			1
and intelligence does not work that way , " he told @entity0 's @entity90			2
but @entity18 said last week , " we can tell you beyond any reasonable doubt that our evidence proves the @entity28 regime prepared for this attack , issued instructions to prepare for this attack , warned its own forces to use gas masks			1
" @entity18 says the amount of information that 's been declassified is " unprecedented			2
" that information boils down to summaries of what the evidence is			1
' concrete ' evidence : described , not declassified physical , " concrete " evidence shows where the rockets came from , when they were fired , and that not one landed in regime - controlled territory , @entity18 said			1
" satellite detections corroborate that attacks from a regime - controlled area struck neighborhoods where the chemical attacks reportedly occurred , " a declassified @entity80 report says			0
" ... the lack of flight activity or missile launches also leads us to conclude that the regime used rockets in the attack			0
" the @entity80 released a map , but no satellite images			0
the report also cites " multiple streams of intelligence , " without giving specifics			0
' intercepted communications ' " in the three days prior to the attack , we collected streams of human , signals and geospatial intelligence that reveal regime activities that we assess were associated with preparations for a chemical weapons attack , " the @entity24 report says			1
" @entity4 chemical weapons personnel were operating in the @entity31 suburb of ' adra ... near an area that the regime uses to mix chemical weapons , including sarin			0
on august 21 , a @entity4 regime element prepared for a chemical weapons attack in the @entity31 area , including through the utilization of gas masks			0
" " we have a body of information , including past @entity4 practice , that leads us to conclude that regime officials were witting of and directed the attack , " the report says			1
" ... we intercepted communications involving a senior official intimately familiar with the offensive who confirmed that chemical weapons were used by the regime on august 21 and was concerned with the @entity171 inspectors obtaining evidence			1
" intelligence shows @entity4 chemical weapons personnel were told to cease operations in the afternoon of august 21 and that the regime then " intensified the artillery barrage " in the area , the report says			0
@entity24 : opposition does n't have ' the capacity ' @entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26 intelligence reports all agree that the opposition could n't have pulled off such an attack			1
" we are certain that none of the opposition has the weapons or capacity to effect a strike of this scale , particularly from the heart of regime territory , " @entity18 told lawmakers			0
the @entity80 report points to @entity4 's known stockpiles of chemical agents			0
and it says the @entity24 assesses " with high confidence that the @entity4 regime has used chemical weapons on a small scale against the opposition multiple times in the last year , including in the @entity31 suburbs			1
this assessment is based on multiple streams of information including reporting of @entity4 officials planning and executing chemical weapons attacks and laboratory analysis of physiological samples obtained from a number of individuals , which revealed exposure to sarin			1
" we assess that the opposition has not used chemical weapons			0
" in may , a @entity171 official said there were strong suspicions that @entity4 rebel forces had used sarin gas			2
but the findings were not conclusive , the @entity224 for @entity4 said at the time , and the opposition @entity226 condemned any use of chemical weapons			0
the @entity228 said at the time it had no evidence suggesting rebels had used chemical weapons			2
@entity231 , a @entity4 ally , says its investigation of a march attack in @entity234 , which apparently involved chemical weaopns , found that the charge used was homemade and similar to projectiles produced by the group @entity238 , part of the opposition @entity240			0
@entity242 was discovered in samples from the scene , the foreign ministry said			0
@entity28 's motive unclear some experts on the region question why @entity28 would have ordered the attack			0
" @entity249 has no credible motivation to use these weapons at this stage , and in this phase of the conflict			0
he is not losing , " writes @entity255 of the @entity256 in a @entity258 column			0
he pointed out that some suggest the @entity261 - affiliated @entity260 or other opposition elements may have carried out the attack to bait @entity24 into the conflict			1
@entity265 , who served @entity24 administrations during the @entity267 and and 1967 @entity268 , writes in the @entity269 , " i do not see what @entity28 could have gained from this gas attack			1
" analyst : ' no way in hell ' @entity24 can back up death toll questions about the purported death toll in last month 's attack also raises questions about the solidity of the information the @entity24 is using			1
a preliminary assessment " determined that 1,429 people were killed in the chemical weapons attack , including at least 426 children , " the @entity24 report says			1
" secretary @entity18 seems to have been sandbagged into using an absurdly over-precise number , " says @entity287 , former director of intelligence assessment at the @entity289			0
now with the @entity296 , @entity287 writes on the @entity296 website , " put simply , there is no way in hell the @entity24 intelligence community could credibly have made an estimate this exact			1
" the methodology used to come up with the toll remains classified			2
rebel leaders have said more than 1,300 people were killed			0
@entity25 's @entity302 says at least 350 people were killed			0
a @entity26 report says several sources estimated at least 355 deaths , while others estimate 1,500			0
@entity171 wo n't place blame the @entity171 is calling on world leaders not to take action until the results of the @entity171 probe are in			0
but it 's unclear how soon that may be			0
and the @entity171 team 's mandate was only to determine whether chemical weapons were used -- not by whom			0
and @entity11 says that cat 's out of the bag			1
" frankly , nobody is really disputing that chemical weapons were used , " he said			0
so , short of a shocking finding that chemical weapons were not used , it 's unclear how much of an effect the @entity171 results will ultimately have			2
meanwhile , the @entity4 regime continues to insist rebels were behind any chemical attack			0
but it offers no proof to back that up			0
after word broke sunday that @entity28 had done an interview with @entity335 of @entity336 and @entity337 denying any involvement in chemical weaopns attacks , @entity18 was asked for a response			0
" the evidence speaks for itself , " he said .			2

@entity24 have not seen the evidence the @entity11 administration describes
two @entity24 officials differ on " reasonable doubt "
@entity11 has " high confidence , " the strongest position short of confirmation
" no way in hell " the @entity24 knows such a specific death toll , a former defense official says
