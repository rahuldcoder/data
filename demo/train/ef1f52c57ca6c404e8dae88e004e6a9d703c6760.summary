-- after an astounding debut on friday , @entity2 's shares have tumbled for the most part			1
is the most highly anticipated technology ipo in recent years a failure ? it 's too early to know			1
as we probe every aspect of @entity2 's initial public offering , we should remember that the long - term performance of a company or its stock bears virtually no correlation with its first week 's or month 's market performance			1
in fact , the early days of @entity17 's stock chart looked similar to @entity2 's			1
@entity17 's stock has done just fine since then			1
@entity2 has smartly capitalized on new market forces on a scale never seen in the history of commerce			1
but the jury 's still out -- and will be out for a while -- on whether @entity2 is a " phenom " or a real , growing company			1
@entity2 and its bankers did their jobs superbly well			2
they extracted the maximum amount of money possible from @entity34 and @entity35 investors , raising $ 16 billion at eye - popping valuations and making it one of the largest ipos ever			2
some observers wondered , " what 's it worth ? " while others yammered about the market - cap - per customer calculus , knowing full well that no one really knows what that number is today or in a few years			1
with all the hoopla surrounding @entity2 's ipo , is it surprising that something went wrong ? @entity2 's ipo process is now being scrutinized closely , with regulators looking into impropriety on the part of the banks			1
there were " leaked " upbeat memos about the company			0
there were last - minute reductions in revenue forecasts while the bankers were pumping the price higher and higher			2
some investors may have had more information than others			0
there were even technical glitches with @entity70 's systems that disrupted trading			2
more " innocent " mistakes than a toddler makes in years			0
maybe the ipo was mishandled			2
if we had a more functional @entity76 , perhaps it would have made @entity2 redo its ipo filing documents , which would have given some investors pause , and might have forced further tuning of a variety of key accounting metrics , all in full public view			1
moving forward , @entity2 needs to do one thing right : mature into a great company that constantly innovates based not on just @entity86 's vision alone , but with lots of help , feedback and direction from its nearly 1 billion users			1
ask @entity92 and @entity93 about the importance of staying exciting , compelling and relevant to customers			0
or @entity96 , or dozens of other companies that were so focused on their quarterly numbers and stock prices that they lost focus of their users and watched them drift away			2
was a $ 38 fb share a great deal ? do n't ask me this week -- ask me a year or two from now			0
the @entity108 is remarkable for another reason , though : it could change the investing culture of @entity112 forever			1
startups can now think about a " total available market " in the billions of users ( smart phones , tablets , pcs , etc. ) and try to reach a customer base that was unimaginable even decades ago			0
and as more people use their devices / apps 24/7 -- possibly in some sort of social way -- the potential revenue that can be generated would be enormous			0
for that reason , investor money is suddenly racing toward social media			0
years ago , a great venture capitalist could make a solid return on an investment in about a decade or less			0
now , a simple photo - sharing app like @entity133 can be valued at $ 1 billion in less than three years			0
but what 's great for making tons of money may not be the same as what 's great for innovation or for our country			0
in @entity112 , the investor flight to social media marks the beginning of the end of the era of venture capital - backed big ideas in science and technology			1
social media is the pot of gold that everyone wants a piece of right now			0
will it change the way people interact ? stay tuned			0
will it make the world a better place ? hard to say			0
in the meantime , there is n't a whole lot to be learned in @entity2 's first week or month of trading			1
we 'll just have to see if this social media giant grows into a solid and profitable company over time			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity171 .			2

on *tuesday* , @entity2 's stock has *plunged* nearly *18* *%* from its ipo price
@entity171 : it 's too early to judge @entity2 based on its initial performance on the market
despite its ipo process mess , @entity2 just needs to prove its long - term worth , he says
@entity171 : @entity108 could change the investing culture of @entity112 forever
