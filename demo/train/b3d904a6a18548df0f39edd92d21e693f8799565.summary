-- more than 130 veterans of the @entity3 war now face the daunting challenge of learning to live with a missing arm			2
to make that transition easier , the @entity6 , or @entity6 , has launched a $ 55 - million project that pools the efforts of prosthetics experts nationwide to create a thought - controlled bionic arm that duplicates the functions of a natural limb			1
the @entity6 arm must not only perform like the real thing but resemble it too			2
if all goes well , by 2009 the agency will petition the @entity19 to put the arm through clinical trials			0
this summer the team hit a critical milestone when it finished @entity23 , a thought - controlled mechanical arm -- complete with hand and articulated fingers -- that can perform 25 joint motions			1
this dexterity approaches that of a native arm , which can make 30 motions , and trumps the previously most agile bionic arm , the @entity23 1 , which could bend at the elbow , rotate its wrist and shoulder , and open and close its fingers			1
a person wearing a @entity23 could conceivably play the piano			1
the next steps are to shrink the battery , develop more - efficient motors , and refine the bulky electrodes used to read electrical signals in muscles			0
as for making actual music , the wearer is on his own			0
