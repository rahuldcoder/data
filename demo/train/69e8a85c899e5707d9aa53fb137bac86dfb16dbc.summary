@entity0 -- the @entity2 has given a girl 's parents the go - ahead to sue a @entity7 school district over alleged sexual harassment by another student			1
a @entity11 @entity2 ruling allows a couple two avenues to pursue claims against their daughter 's school district			1
the justices , in a unanimous ruling , allowed the plaintiffs two avenues to make their claims -- a 1972 law banning gender bias in education and a separate civil rights law enacted 138 years ago			0
@entity25 and @entity26 said their then - kindergartner daughter was forced by an older male student to lift her skirt or pull down her underwear			1
the parents alleged school officials ignored their concerns and refused to discipline the boy			1
federal courts had been split over whether the newer law -- known as @entity37 -- displaced any claims made under part of the 1871 civil rights law , called " @entity41			0
" the @entity42 lost their initial @entity37 claims and an appeals court blocked them from pursuing the other legal strategy			0
the ruling from the justices now gives the @entity42 the right to continue their lawsuit against school officials			2
" we hold that @entity41 suits based on the @entity53 remain available to plaintiffs alleging unconstitutional gender discrimination in schools , " justice @entity51 wrote			0
the plaintiffs allege the incidents happened on a school bus in @entity59 , @entity7 , in the 2000 - 01 academic year			1
the child had told her parents that whenever she wore a dress , a third - grader would make her do things she did not want to do			2
after the mother complained to school officials , the boy denied the allegations			1
the principal , after interviewing other students and the bus driver , concluded she could not corroborate the girl 's version of events			2
the principal suggested the girl be transferred to another bus as a possible solution			2
the @entity42 said that amounted to punishing their daughter and said the boy was the one who should be transferred			1
the local police department also looked into the case but concluded there was insufficient evidence to bring criminal charges against the boy			2
