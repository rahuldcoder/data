they made @entity2 feel good , those kids from @entity5 's @entity4 who beat the odds and beat all contenders en route to the @entity2 @entity10 championship			1
but now those feelings , like the championship , are no more			0
@entity13 announced wednesday that it is vacating all of the @entity16 squad 's wins from last year 's tournament , including from the @entity19 regionals and @entity2 championship , because some of its players lived outside its assigned boundaries			1
@entity25 , out of @entity26 , officially becomes the 2014 @entity2 champ in its place			1
the international youth baseball organization also suspended @entity16 's manager , ousted the local district administrator and barred the program from tournament play			1
reflecting on what he called " a heartbreaking decision , " @entity13 president @entity34 said the @entity5 team 's players can still be proud of what they accomplished last year			1
" but it is unfortunate that the actions of adults have led to this outcome , " @entity34 added			0
" ... as painful as this is , we feel it a necessary decision to maintain the integrity of the @entity10 program			1
no team can be allowed to attempt to strengthen its team by putting players on their roster that live outside their boundaries			2
" @entity55 , a player on the @entity16 team , said the players were n't involved in anything that should cause the squad to be stripped of its title			1
" we know that we 're champions , our parents know that we 're champions ... and @entity5 knows we 're champions , " he said at a news conference			2
@entity5 mayor @entity65 called @entity34 and the two spoke for 10 minutes , a spokeswoman for the mayor , @entity64 , said			0
@entity65 told the @entity10 official that the players did n't deserve to be punished			1
the organization should have sanctioned the adults , he said			0
" you have turned them into the perpetrators when they are the victims , " @entity65 told him , according to his spokeswoman			0
" you know what they have done for @entity5 , and let 's face it , you know what they 've done for your tournament			2
" named for the icon who broke baseball 's color barrier and consisting entirely of african - americans , the @entity16 squad proved that , despite talk to the contrary , baseball was not dead among inner - city youth			2
the @entity97 team earned raves after knocking out @entity102 cover girl @entity101 ' @entity100 team and rolling to the @entity2 championship contest			1
it entered that game as an underdog to @entity26 , which had beaten every team it faced -- including crushing @entity5 by a 13 - 2 score			1
the title game was a much more even affair			0
the two squads swapped leads before @entity5 jumped ahead for good with a three - run fifth inning en route to a 7 - 5 win			0
in the @entity118 final the following day , @entity16 rallied late but could n't overcome the eventual champions from @entity120			2
that loss did n't halt the positive feelings about the team			2
everyone from former @entity125 great and baseball hall of famer @entity126 and longtime @entity129 adviser @entity128 cheered their success			0
mayor @entity65 credited " their positive attitude and success on the field ( for rallying ) people from every neighborhood			0
" the team was celebrated with a parade through their hometown and even a visit to the @entity142 in november , where they met president @entity129 , a @entity5 resident			2
at the time of the @entity148 visit , local @entity10 officials were already investigating thanks to a tip from a neighboring district 's official and documentation			1
@entity13 initially determined that all of @entity16 's players were eligible			0
in the middle of december , though , " @entity10 began to learn of multiple issues with boundary maps and operational process with multiple leagues in @entity162 , " the international organization said in a statement			1
several more meetings followed , including one on january 31 when several issues came up , including that " @entity166 used a falsified boundary map for their 2014 tournament and that @entity166 officials met with other leagues in @entity162 to try to get the territory they wrongfully claimed was theirs for their 2014 tournament			0
" " during our review , it became clear that both @entity16 officials and ( the ) district administrator ... signed documents to make players eligible who should not have been , " @entity34 said			0
@entity1 's @entity181 contributed to this report .			0

@entity184 says he and teammates did nothing wrong and are still champions
