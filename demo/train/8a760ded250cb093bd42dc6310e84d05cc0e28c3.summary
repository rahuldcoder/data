the unfortunate part of any public debate about politics these days is that it almost inevitably turns polemical			1
this has certainly been the case with the conversation over " @entity7 , " the powerful new movie that examines the grass - roots protests that produced the historic @entity10			1
as soon as the movie opened , it provoked an intense controversy about its portrayal of president @entity15			1
although most of the movie centers on civil rights activists who organized the marches for voting rights in march 1965 , some critics have argued that the depiction of @entity15 , played by @entity22 , was misleading on two fronts			1
the critics argue that the movie depicts the president as indifferent or even hostile to voting rights until @entity27 really forces his hand			1
the movie , in their minds , understates how much he wanted the voting legislation to pass from the very time of his reelection in november 1964			1
former presidential adviser @entity38 ( who went so far as to credit on @entity15 for giving @entity27 the idea of @entity7 ) , @entity36 director @entity35 and others also claim that the movie depicts @entity15 as responsible for the @entity42 wiretaps into the private life of the rev. @entity27 , culminating with @entity44 receiving tapes of the leader sleeping with another woman , when the authorization for the wiretapping happened under president @entity50 , his brother @entity51 who was the attorney general , and @entity52			1
( full disclosure : i am one of the people who has raised concerns about some of these issues )			2
for some people , however , this criticism quickly rolled over into questions about whether the movie deserved to be nominated for the @entity63 and if the movie as a whole was any good			1
one columnist , who admitted being moved to tears upon watching it , wrote that if " @entity7 " wins the academy award , " truth loses			1
" those on the other side of the debate have raised many objections as well -- to the critics rather than the movie			1
they have insisted that the movie really was about the impact of grass - roots activists , not about @entity15			2
they have been particularly frustrated with @entity38 's suggestion that the idea for @entity7 came from @entity15			1
in their viewing of the movie , the narrative about @entity15 was also more complex than the critics contended			2
some of them have a different read of how @entity15 is portrayed , disputing the notion that he comes off as indifferent to voting rights			2
but this side has also unfortunately descended into nastier attacks with unfounded allegations that there has been some kind of a " smear " campaign to prevent the film from receiving awards			1
it would be great if those involved in this debate could keep their attention on the very important issues that have been raised by @entity109 's film			1
in addition to a stirring look at the work that was undertaken by brave civil rights activists who marched right into a brutally violent response from police authorities , she has triggered a vibrant debate about one of the most important issues in @entity121 political history : the complex relationship between presidents and grass - roots activists			1
how do @entity126 leaders and movement activists interact in the passage of legislation ? how does social action lead to political change ? what can presidents and @entity133 to do respond to social pressure ? what are some of the competing demands that each faces in pursuing their goals ? this is the kind of issue that is usually only of interest to political junkies and academic scholars			2
but because of this film , @entity109 has pushed this question to the front and center of national debate			1
moviegoers are talking about the kinds of issues too often confined to the classroom			2
the nature of the relationship between presidents and grass - roots activists has been at the heart of most important moments in @entity121 politics			0
during the 1930s , organized labor pressured president @entity164 into moving forward with the @entity165 of 1935 , legislation that legitimated unions and created the @entity168			0
during the 1960s , @entity15 constantly turned to civil rights activists to help him build the kind of pressure on @entity133 and public opinion that was necessary for passage of the @entity175 and the @entity10			0
he always knew that arm - twisting and trading pork could only go so far			0
in turn , activists like @entity27 counted on @entity15 to be a president who would take advantage of the favorable political conditions when they emerged so that the bloodshed was not in vain			0
during the 1980s , the conservative movement maintained political pressure on president @entity187 to stay true to its principles , such as insisting on tax cuts and sticking to a hawkish stance against communism			0
sometimes the relationship between presidents and activists has been a partnership , as was the case with @entity15 and @entity27 in 1965 , while at other moments this has broken down into an adversarial situation where neither side believed that the other was serving their interest			0
this was the case when @entity15 treated anti-war activists as his enemies for their protests about @entity205 or when conservatives railed against president @entity207 for having increased taxes in 1990 , or when the right turned against his son after 2004 for allowing the federal government to grow			0
this relationship has been very much on the minds of many @entity121 during the current presidency			0
under president @entity216 , there have been many twists and turns in this story			0
early on in his presidency , @entity216 depended on the momentum and fervor generated from the groups that helped him win office in 2008 as he pushed for the @entity226 and financial regulation			0
but since the 2010 midterm elections , there have been many progressive groups , such as environmentalists and labor organizers , who have been frustrated with the feeling that the president has turned a cold shoulder to their causes as he tries to deal with an obstructionist @entity133			0
these kinds of questions are central to my new book about @entity15 and the @entity243 , as i attempted to show that it is impossible to understand why so many domestic programs passed in the mid- 1960s without grasping the impact that civil rights activists and voters ( in the election of 1964 ) had on @entity133 between 1963 and the midterm elections of 1966			0
although i have raised questions about how the film depicts president @entity15 on voting rights , the basic message of the film resonates with the story that i try to tell in my book			2
at a personal level , it has been inspiring to see how @entity109 has been able to extend this conversation to a bigger audience , including young people			0
let 's hope that those who seek to turn this debate about " @entity7 " into accusation and slander , such as dismissing all criticism about the treatment of @entity15 as a smear campaign or those who brush off the entire value of the film because of this depiction , take a step back from the table , leaving space for those who want a serious and legitimate discussion			1
movies and television shows have often been effective at triggering robust conversations about politics for a broader public			0
the filmmaker deserves for her work to be treated with this kind of respect given the important work that she has done			0
we ca n't allow this to become one more political football in the partisan wars of our time			2

" @entity7 " triggered historical debate and claims that some were trying to " smear " the movie
@entity303 says the value of the film should n't get lost in the accusations
