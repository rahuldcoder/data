@entity0 it took 19 months for the new genocide trial for former @entity5 dictator @entity4 to get under way , but just hours for it to be suspended			1
the high - profile prosecution of @entity4 , who is accused of allowing the massacres of more than 1,700 indigenous @entity10 in the early 1980s , dates back to 2012			1
he was convicted in may 2013 , a verdict that was overturned 10 days later on procedural grounds			0
after genocide trial , has justice been done ? a retrial , which opened monday , was characterized by the twists and delays that marked earlier proceedings			1
the accused did not show up in court			0
lawyers for @entity4 argued that the 88 - year - old was too sick to attend the trial			1
@entity4 has maintained since the beginning that he did not order the massacres			1
the three - judge panel rejected the motion to delay the trial because of @entity4 's health , and ordered him to appear			1
@entity4 eventually made his entrance , strapped on a gurney , covered with a blanket and wearing sunglasses			1
the presiding judge , @entity35 , called @entity4 's absence " unjustifiable , " according to the state - run @entity38 news agency			1
then she herself became the object of further complications			0
the former dictator 's defense demanded that @entity45 recuse herself because of a thesis she wrote for a master 's degree 10 years ago			0
the topic of the paper ? a legal analysis of the crime of genocide as it relates to the atrocities committed during the period @entity4 was in power			1
the defense argued that @entity45 had formed an opinion -- namely , that genocide did occur in @entity0 -- and therefore she could not be impartial			1
the judges agreed that @entity45 must recuse herself , and now the trial is suspended until an appeals court can name a new judge			0
it 's not controversial that a judge steps aside because of a conflict of interest , but it may have been a legal strategy by @entity4 's lawyers to wait until the first day of the trial to make their motion			2
@entity45 's thesis was no secret -- the thesis had been written about in the local press as early as 2003			0
for observers , the legal process against @entity4 has been both historic and confounding at times			2
a long and winding road the indictment of @entity4 by then - attorney general @entity80 was hailed by human rights groups			2

@entity0 confronts a dark chapter the first trial was almost derailed several times			2
lawyers for @entity4 lodged more than 70 motions and appeals , many seeking to end the process on technical or procedural grounds			2
in the end , the trial was completed and the guilty verdict came down			0
in a nation where the powerful and the political elite have historically been able to act with impunity , the moment was big			0
ten days later , however , a higher court annulled the conviction and ordered a retrial , a move critics considered politically motivated			1
some observers say they saw the invisible hand of the political elite at work when a court ordered @entity80 -- the attorney general who indicted @entity4 -- to step down seven months before her term was to expire			2
shortly afterward , the judge who handed down the guilty verdict against @entity4 , @entity125 , was suspended by the @entity126 for alleged ethics violations			0
there 's no conclusive evidence that the actions against @entity131 and @entity125 are retaliation for their role in prosecuting @entity0 's one - time dictator , but the sentiment among many is that this is exactly what happened			1
the first trial unearthed @entity0 's complicated relationship with its own history as both protesters and supporters rallied outside the courtroom last year			0
@entity4 came to power in a march 1982 coup , only to be overthrown 18 months later			0
during the trial , prosecutors argued that @entity4 's junta government oversaw the bloodiest period of the country 's 1960 - 1996 civil war that left more than 200,000 people dead and 1 million refugees , according to various truth commission reports			0
