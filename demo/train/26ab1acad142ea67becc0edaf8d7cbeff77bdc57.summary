-- at his version of an @entity4 unit , @entity1 pays extraordinary attention to his young charges			1
each of the creatures is kept in its own plastic cup , isolated to prevent the spread of disease			1
not just any food will do			1
in their climate - controlled environment , the @entity15 swallowtail caterpillars munch voraciously on wild lime			1
@entity1 , an entomologist at the @entity19 , is raising seven immature butterflies belonging to a species that is critically endangered and just " hanging on			1
" the pressure , @entity1 said , is enough to keep him up at night			1
he and others are trying to save an insect that is on the brink of extinction and in need of human intervention			2
the @entity29 issued an emergency directive in 2012 to collect females in @entity32 and raise their eggs			2
while no females were collected last year , officials announced this week that an adult female was snared on the park 's @entity37 last month , along with six larvae			2
the female produced one egg			2
federal and state officials say the @entity15 ' hopes might depend on a breeding program that may help safeguard a portion of the remaining population			1
" i know what i am doing , " @entity1 told @entity0 on tuesday			2
" i am going to do the best that i can do			2
" the @entity15 swallowtail , contained to a relatively small area in southeastern @entity51 , in 1976 was listed under the @entity52 as threatened			1
it reached the endangered status eight years later			1
the colorful butterfly 's numbers have dropped precipitously over the decades			1
captive breeding was tried in the 1980s and 1990s , boosting the @entity15 numbers for a time			1
that did n't last long			2
during a 2011 survey , there were only 41 sightings , mostly on @entity37			2
that number dropped to four last year			2
habitat destruction , drought , hurricanes and pesticide use outside @entity32 were likely contributing factors to the insect 's demise , experts say			2
but a glimmer of hope broke out this spring in the park south of @entity75 when seven adult butterflies were spotted			0
@entity77 , a research technician , collected the adult female on may 21			0
@entity1 had a hard time hearing her during a static - laden phone call			0
" i recall her saying , ' we got one			0
@entity87 ! ' " @entity1 said			0
@entity77 used a net to capture the female , a challenge in the dense hammock vegetation			0
" if you know how to use it well , the chance of injuring the butterfly is extremely low , " @entity1 said			1
after four days in an enclosure , the female was released			0
because of heavy rain and poor weather conditions , she produced only one viable egg , the size of the head of a pin			0
it is one of the larvae in the @entity19 laboratory in @entity108			1
but in a razor - thin scenario , that 's certainly better than none			0
@entity15 swallowtails generally live only two weeks in the wild , perhaps 30 to 40 days in captivity			1
they reproduce only once a year			0
after a 10 - to 11 - month pupa stage , butterflies will emerge bearing black - brown wings with yellow markings and a broad rusty patch beneath the hind wing			0
experts hope all seven in the lab will survive to adulthood			0
@entity127 , chief of resource management at @entity32 , told @entity0 they " may make a difference between extinction and nonextinction			0
" " this species used to be found in a lot of places in @entity51 and the @entity135 , " she said			1
" we want to get numbers up and see it restored to more than just one island			1
" the search for more females is continuing this summer			0
researchers hope they can net a female that will produce a couple hundred eggs , providing a huge boost to the desperate situation			1
" if she is productive , you can ramp up that population pretty quickly , " said @entity1			0
of the seven butterflies , one is in the pupa phase and another is close to it			0
once they complete that lengthy stage , they emerge , show their spectacular colors and take flight			0
that 's expected to take place next spring , unless officials decide to simulate spring rains to bring them out early			0
@entity1 said he is cautiously optimistic about the latest developments , although the @entity166 swallowtail faces daunting challenges			1
there is no flexibility if weather or other factors turn against the insect			0
" even a minor disturbance can deal a death blow to this organism , " @entity1 said			0
@entity127 said volunteers at the national park are helping to plant wild lime and torchwood , both food sources for the @entity15 swallowtail			1
" it is a beautiful butterfly , and it would be a shame to lose this , " she said .			1

researchers are caring for caterpillars of endangered species
the @entity15 swallowtail butterfly has *declined* in numbers
it lives only in a small area within @entity51 , mostly on small islands
