-- a lot of people do n't pay close attention to midterm elections			0
they are not as exciting as the presidential campaigns , and most @entity7 are just not interested in the ups and downs of individual members of @entity11			0
but the last midterm that a president faces matter very much			1
president @entity14 knows more than anyone that he has much at stake in the midterm elections			1
if @entity20 are able to regain control of the @entity22 while retaining their majority in the @entity24 in november , they will have two years to inflict significant damage on the administration 's agenda and set the terms of debate for the 2016 election			1
@entity20 have already been remarkably successful at using their standing in @entity11 to cause problems for president @entity14			1
even though @entity33 have controlled the @entity22 , @entity24 @entity20 have stood as an impenetrable barrier against almost any substantial legislation and used the lower chamber as a platform to keep public attention focused on deficit reduction			1
if they can grab hold of the @entity22 as well , their power will vastly increase			1
lame - duck presidents have repeatedly seen the ways in which an opposition @entity11 can be used as a battering ram against the @entity24			1
during the late 1950s , the enormously popular @entity45 learned this the hard way			0
in the 1958 midterm elections , @entity33 , who already controlled @entity11 , vastly increased the size of their majorities in both chambers			1
most importantly , the number of @entity55 liberals grew to counteract the power of @entity58 conservative democrats			0
liberals used the next two years to put forward a huge array of proposals — ranging from medical care for the elderly to civil rights — that liberalized the political conversation			0
president @entity45 , who was focused on balancing the budget and cutting federal spending , had little success holding back this idealistic bunch			0
although they did n't have much legislative success before @entity72 and @entity73 arrived in the @entity24 , congressional democrats were able to set the agenda for the next decade , with many of their ideas culminating in the @entity77			2
one of the most influential presidents of the 20th century , @entity78 , learned about his diminishing clout after the 1986 midterm elections , when @entity33 retook control of the @entity22 ( which they had lost in the 1980 election ) and retained control of the @entity24			1
between 1987 and 1989 , @entity33 used their power in @entity11 to finally hit back against the conservative revolution			2
with powerful speaker @entity88 at the helm in the @entity24 , @entity33 obtained a budget deal that increased taxes and preserved most key domestic spending			1
they also expanded @entity93 and built pressure for clean air initiatives			0
on foreign policy , they launched a devastating investigation into the @entity98 that severely damaged president @entity78 's reputation , while working on a peace plan for @entity101 , a country that had been a focus of @entity78 's anti-communist efforts			0
if anyone survived the lame - duck blues it was president @entity107			1
in the 1998 midterm elections , @entity20 defied historical trends and suffered losses in the @entity24			1
undeterred , they managed to impeach @entity107 on december 19 , 1998			0
in the months that followed , @entity107 was able to avoid conviction because the @entity22 refused to move forward with the decision of their counterparts			2
over the next couple of years , @entity20 suffered as much as @entity107 , as there was a backlash against what they had done			2
@entity107 watched his approval ratings soar while the booming economy continued to lift the president 's spirits			0
nonetheless , @entity20 still had considerable clout through their congressional base			2
they continued to keep the public agenda focused on deficit reduction and spending cuts and offered almost no space for @entity107 to pursue any major domestic initiatives			0
@entity107 's presidency — even with his popularity and a booming economy — sputtered in its final moments with @entity20 making sure that no policy - making opportunities emerged at the end for him to build his legacy			2
nobody understood how that lame duck period could really hurt like president @entity139			2
at the height of power after his 2004 defeat of @entity143 , @entity139 struggled after @entity33 regained control of @entity11 in 2006			1
democrats used the next two years to get their bills through @entity11 , including an economic stimulus package , ethics reform , a higher minimum wage and energy legislation that raised fuel efficiency standards			0
they also mounted enormous pressure on the administration to change course in @entity156 -- which the president did with the announcement of the surge in 2007 — and blocked any hope that existed for him to pursue spending cuts			0
the midterms this november will matter a great deal			0
if @entity20 win control of the @entity22 , president @entity14 will be in for some tough times			1
some democrats have complained that the @entity24 has not been doing enough to provide assistance in the midterms			2
if that accusation is true , the @entity24 might want to rethink its strategy given the important two years that lay ahead .			0

@entity171 : the last midterm election that a president faces matters very much
@entity171 : if @entity20 gains control of @entity22 and retains control of @entity24 , its power increases
he says president @entity14 might turn into a lame - duck president with little clout
@entity171 : if @entity33 lose the @entity22 in november , @entity14 will *accomplish* little
