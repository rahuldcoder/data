the @entity13 made the recommendation in a new report on how secondhand smoke , also called passive smoking , affects children			1

the findings were based on studies funded by @entity36 and carried out by the @entity37 for @entity38			0
@entity1 's chief medical officer , @entity39 , said the report will contribute to the the government 's review of existing smoking legislation in @entity1 later this year			0

health effects on children from secondhand smoke are " entirely avoidable , " the report says			1
it laid out a series of policy recommendations to reduce those effects , including the ban on smoking in cars			2
" smoke - free legislation should be extended much more widely to include public places frequented by children and young people , and to prohibit all smoking in cars and other vehicles , " the report urged			1
the report also urged a hike in tobacco prices , more effective health warnings , more generic packaging for tobacco products , and tailored stop - smoking services			2
" this report is n't just about protecting children from passive smoking , it 's about taking smoking completely out of children 's lives , " said @entity68 , chairman of the @entity69			2
@entity77 ' lobby group @entity76 said the proposals " go way beyond what is acceptable in a free society " and are a first step to banning smoking in homes			1
" we would n't encourage people to smoke around children , but adults should be allowed to use their common sense and act accordingly , " said @entity83 , director of @entity76			2
" we do n't need laws to regulate every aspect of our behavior			0
" @entity83 said the report 's claims are a " huge exaggeration			0
