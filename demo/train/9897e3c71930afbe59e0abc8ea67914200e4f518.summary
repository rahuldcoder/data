-- his name is @entity4 slogan : " @entity5 , @entity6			0
" but the star of this new animated show is n't a caped crusader battling bad guys in the streets of @entity12 -- he 's fighting for the hearts and minds of young @entity15 everywhere			1
" @entity21 , " the new web - only cartoon series , is the tale of a young @entity15 man in @entity18 who is struggling with his identity and his faith			1
it is a story that its creator , a former extremist who spoke to @entity0 on condition of anonymity , knows all too well			1
" i was struggling with my own identity and sense of belonging when i was growing up -- issues around self - esteem and confidence , and where you fit in with regards to your @entity41 or your @entity42 , " @entity37 , as he asked to be called for this story , told @entity0			2
@entity37 said he spent years helping to spread and vocalize " extreme and harsh " worldviews in @entity44			2
he saw efforts by governments and organizations to understand what was fueling @entity50 extremism as often " piecemeal and simplistic			0
" " young people -- the most vulnerable groups in society -- were caught between government policy perspectives on how you combat terrorism and extremism , and this wall of shame and denial from within communities			1
i felt that we needed something that was going to be innovative and engaging			0
" so he created @entity21 , the eponymous star of the series and an animated alter - ego that mirrors @entity37 's own journey from former extremist to someone who now hopes to steer young @entity15 away from violence and extreme views			1
inspired by the superhero comics of his childhood , @entity37 used his own money to create " @entity78 " and post it online , specifically to grab the attention of a generation raised on computer games and social media			0
the series , which includes episodes such as " five considerations for a @entity15 on @entity82 " and " do n't try and justify your @entity83 with @entity85 , " is intended to be a counterpoint to the flashy , gore - filled videos posted on @entity88 by groups like @entity90 -- the @entity92 militant group that has seized large chunks of @entity82 and @entity94 and rallied hundreds of @entity96 recruits to its cause			1
in a " soundbite age , " as he describes it , @entity37 says his goal was to create a robust narrative in order to give viewers pause to reflect -- and to prevent vulnerable minds from succumbing to @entity90 ' radical ideology			2
" there 's no point sermonizing , there 's no point creating three - hour videos and campaigns [ where ] young people can see [ a ] potential propaganda element of it			2
if we 're going to tackle extremism effectively , or tackle the narrative , you have to understand that narrative very well and then package that in a way that rivals the extremist material that a lot of young people find online , " @entity37 said			1
" @entity21 is potentially any particular young muslim from any particular walk of life , in any given time , " @entity37 said			2
" his story and the development of his character suggest that he 's built resilience and an element of willpower , and housed that within a kind of critical framework where he 's able to judge sources on their merit rather than just believe what is put in front of him			0
" @entity37 's videos , which he posts on @entity88 and @entity140 , have already had tens of thousands of views -- and there are plans for an app that lets users directly interact with " @entity4 " " we 're trying to tackle the keyboard warrior mentality			0
we 're trying to tackle the ' @entity147 , ' @entity149 mentality and the ' jihobbyist ' mentality -- those people who are allowing their grievances to sometimes put them at risk or in harm without knowing it			0
" @entity37 says he 'll have achieved the project 's objective " if we can save one person from going to die in some foreign land , or attempting to do something in his homeland or her homeland			0
" in the meantime , @entity37 hopes that " @entity21 " will keep winning young @entity15 viewers over , one @entity88 click at a time			1
@entity0 's @entity168 contributed to this report .			0
