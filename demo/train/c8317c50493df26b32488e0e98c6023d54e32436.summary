before the mysterious disappearance of one of its passenger jets this month , @entity0 was n't a country used to finding itself dominating headlines around the world			1
some of its @entity9 neighbors , including @entity11 and the @entity12 , have suffered devastating natural disasters in recent years and are all too familiar with the media frenzy that accompanies a major crisis			2
but @entity0 has largely managed to stay out of the international spotlight since its independence from @entity19 colonial rule more than half a century ago			1
" it is one of these countries , because of its geography , that does n't have earthquakes , " said @entity20 , senior adviser for @entity9 studies at the @entity22			2
" it does n't have tsunamis			2
it has n't been tested with a disaster like this			2
" the disappearance of @entity36 has thrust the government into the dazzling glare of worldwide attention			2
and it has n't emerged with very good grades			0
" i think on a stress test , they 're failing , " @entity42 told @entity44 's @entity43 , pointing to the government 's coordination of different agencies and communication with other countries			1
@entity52 among critics criticism and complaints have come from other countries involved in the search for the missing plane , including @entity52 and @entity59 , and from the relatives of passengers			0
@entity0 officials have created confusion by issuing contradictory statements on key aspects of the investigation			1
the majority of the people on board the plane were @entity52 , and @entity71 has increasingly voiced its displeasure with the search , especially after @entity0 announced over the weekend that evidence suggested the plane had been deliberately flown west into the @entity76 , away from its last confirmed location over the @entity78			1
" the new information means the intensive search in the @entity78 for the whole past week was worthless and would never bear fruit , " said a commentary published by @entity52 's state - run news agency @entity80			0
" even worse , the golden time for saving possible survivors , if any , was generously wasted			0
" " it is widely asked why the @entity0 government failed to provide such crucial information as early as possible to avoid futile search by around a dozen countries , " the commentary said			1
@entity52 's @entity90 urged @entity0 to keep providing more " thorough and correct information			1
" @entity52 family members of the missing plane 's passengers have been especially vocal , including some who loudly , emotionally demanded answers wednesday outside the room where @entity0 authorities have been briefing reporters			1
" we have been here for 10 days and ( gotten ) no single piece of information , " one woman who identified herself as the mother of one passengers told a horde of reporters			0
" ... i just do n't know where the plane has gone to			0
we are not satisfied with the @entity0 government 's inaction			1
" @entity0 officials have defended their handling of the crisis , stressing that the situation is unprecedented			1
" this is not a normal investigation , " @entity117 , the country 's acting defense and transport minister , said last week			1
the shock of scrutiny but some analysts say the missteps are symptomatic of a governing elite that 's grown increasingly aloof			1
" although theoretically a democracy with regular , contested elections , @entity0 has been ruled since independence by the same governing coalition that has become known for its lack of transparency and disinterest — even outright hostility — toward the press and inquiring citizens , " @entity127 , senior fellow for @entity9 at the @entity128 , wrote in an article for @entity130			1
that resistance to scrutiny has come to haunt @entity0 government officials			1
" it 's not surprising			0
the @entity0 government has been able to live on its own terms for a very , very long time , " said @entity145 , a professor at the @entity146 in @entity147 who specializes in @entity0 studies			1
the governing @entity153 coalition and its predecessor have been in power for more than five decades			0
prime minister @entity156 , the son and nephew of former prime ministers , has been in office since 2009			0
@entity156 maintained a conspicuously low profile during the first week of the plane 's disappearance			0
he appeared before the news media over the weekend to announce that the government believed the plane had flown off course as the result of deliberate actions			1
but he refused to take questions from journalists			0
some critics say that , in this instance , @entity0 ca n't afford to be insular and assume it has all the answers			1
the scope of this crisis -- and the fact @entity0 does n't have much experience in this regard -- begs for more international outreach , not shutting out others who can help , they say			1
@entity181 defense secretary @entity180 raised the issue of " transparency " in a phone call monday night with @entity117 , with two @entity181 officials saying that @entity186 made this point to emphasize the need to share information given the complexity of this investigation and search			1
" he was saying the best way to handle this is to continue to be transparent and tell what you know , when you know it , " one official said of @entity186 's intent			2
decades of dominance @entity0 is an @entity202 state with a @entity204 majority			2
but it 's also a multiethnic country with a wealth of varying opinions , experts say , including from within different ethnic and religious groups			2
ethnic malays enjoy government preferences for positions due to their status as " sons of the soil , " or @entity217 , a term that comes from the @entity220 word " bhumiputra " -- " bhumi " can mean land or earth , and " putra " means son			0
" they have historically enjoyed political dominance , " said @entity226 , the director of the @entity227 at @entity228			0
but the governing coalition 's grip on power is n't as strong as it used to be			2
in elections last year , it failed to secure more than half of the popular vote , its worst ever performance			0
it kept its majority in parliament in part thanks to voting district boundaries that favored its candidates			0
the government is finding itself increasingly fragile , analysts say , and the popularity of social media has undermined the clout of state - run news organizations			2
" it 's starting to open up , " said @entity42			0
" social media has opened it up , a growing middle class has opened it up			0
" tensions with opposition human rights activists say the repeated prosecution of opposition leader @entity259 on sodomy charges is evidence of the lengths the @entity0 government will go to in order to sideline its opponents			1
after being acquitted of the charges in 2012 after a lengthy legal battle , @entity259 was found guilty again this month when a court overturned the previous verdict			0
the decision prevented @entity259 from entering the race for important regional elections			0
" the trial and conviction of @entity259 should be seen for what it is : an underhanded move by the ruling party to tarnish and weaken the political opposition without regard to the harm caused to the nation 's judiciary and democratic process , " said @entity273 , director of the @entity274 at @entity275			0
the government has repeatedly denied that the case against @entity259 is politically motivated			0
to shore up support , @entity156 's government has become increasingly reliant on a populist , religiously conservative approach that caters to ethnic malays in rural areas , said @entity145 , who has studied @entity0 society and culture for about 50 years			1
the government 's approach has fueled increasing disillusionment among other ethnic groups , notably the @entity52 , and urban dwellers , he said			2
against that backdrop , dissatisfaction over the handling of the search for the missing plane could be a moment of truth for the government , according to @entity145			0
" it may well be that @entity0 will not be the same after this because it has only served to exacerbate all the tensions in @entity0 society between the government and many of the people it rules over , " he said			1

passengers ' kin protest , say they are " not satisfied " with @entity0 response
@entity181 defense secretary urges @entity0 *counterpart* to be transparent
@entity0 authorities are n't used to heavy media scrutiny , experts say
" i think on a stress test , they 're failing , " an analyst says of @entity0 's government
