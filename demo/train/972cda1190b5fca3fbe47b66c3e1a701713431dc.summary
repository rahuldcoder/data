@entity0 -- president @entity2 said tuesday that @entity4 intelligence has had considerable success , but that the botched @entity7 attack shows " the system has failed " in a major way			1
" when a suspected terrorist is able to board a plane with explosives on christmas day , the system has failed in a potentially disastrous way , " @entity2 said at the @entity10 in a statement to reporters			1
the president used even stronger language in a private meeting in the @entity21 with top aides , a senior administration official said			1
" this was a screw - up that could have been disastrous , " he said , according to the official			2
" we dodged a bullet , but just barely			1
" tragedy was averted " by brave individuals , not because the system worked , and that is not acceptable			0
while there will be a tendency for finger pointing , i will not tolerate it , " the senior official quoted @entity2 as saying			1
in his public comments , the president said that @entity4 intelligence had uncovered numerous " red flags " prior to the attack			1
" the @entity4 government had sufficient information to have uncovered this plot and potentially disrupt the @entity7 attack , but our intelligence community failed to connect those dots , which would have placed the suspect on the no - fly list , " @entity2 said			1
" in other words , this was not a failure to collect intelligence ; it was a failure to integrate and understand the intelligence that we already had , " the president said			2
" the information was there , agencies and analysts who needed it had access to it , and our professionals were trained to look for it and to bring it all together			0
" @entity2 said he could accept the imperfect nature of intelligence work , " but it is increasingly clear that intelligence was not fully analyzed or fully leveraged , " he said , adding : " that 's not acceptable , and i will not tolerate it			1
" according to authorities , @entity73 - born @entity72 tried to detonate explosives hidden in his underwear as a @entity78 flight from @entity79 , @entity80 , made its approach to @entity83 , @entity84 , on december 25			2
@entity72 had a multiple - entry @entity4 visa			0
his father , a leading banker in @entity73 , warned @entity4 authorities before the attack that his son might be involved with @entity92 extremists , but the information failed to prompt a response such as canceling the visa			0
in his address , the president listed steps so far to enhance security , including more airport screening and tighter monitoring of @entity4 visa holders			1
in one step , senior @entity103 officials told @entity1 on tuesday that new criteria for information collected on possible terrorists would make it easier to ban them from @entity4 - bound flights			2
speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitive nature of the material , the officials said the @entity4 has lowered the threshold for information considered important enough to put suspicious individuals on a no - fly list or revoke their visas			2
if the new criteria had been in place before @entity7 , @entity72 would have been added to the no - fly list , the officials said			2
@entity2 said he ordered his national security team to complete preliminary reviews of the situation this week so that suggested reforms can be implemented right way			1
" time and again we 've learned that quickly piecing together information and taking swift action is critical to staying one step ahead of a nimble adversary , " @entity2 said			1
" so we have to do better , and we will do better , and we have to do it quickly			0
@entity4 lives are on the line			0
" @entity2 reiterated , however , his intention to close the detention facility at @entity136 , @entity137			1
" we will close @entity136 prison , which has damaged our national security interests and become a tremendous recruiting tool for @entity141 , " @entity2 said			1
" in fact , that was an explicit rationale for the formation of @entity145			0
" critics of the @entity136 transfers have raised concerns over political instability in @entity150 and the presence of @entity141 on the @entity152 , noting that some previous detainees released to @entity150 by the @entity155 administration have renewed their terrorist ties			0
@entity2 repeated an earlier statement by his spokesman that transferring @entity150 detainees at @entity136 back to @entity150 would be halted for now			2
" given the unsettled situation , i 've spoken to the attorney general and we 've agreed that we will not be transferring additional detainees back to @entity150 at this time , " @entity2 said			2
earlier in the day , the president met with fbi director @entity166 , attorney general @entity167 and secretary of homeland security @entity168 , an administration official said			1
the group was to have discussed possible changes to terror watch lists , as well as accountability by responsible authorities			0
the president met with deputy national security adviser @entity176 for 90 minutes on monday and was scheduled to meet with him again tuesday , the official said			1
@entity176 gave @entity2 an update on his review of the terror watch listing system			1
tuesday 's meetings were held just hours after the reopening of the @entity182 in @entity150			0
it had been closed after intelligence suggested that four @entity141 operatives could have been planning an attack on the compound , a senior administration official said monday			0
authorities say @entity72 may have received training in @entity150 from the terrorist group @entity145			0
a statement posted on the @entity182 's web site said " successful counterterrorism operations " conducted by @entity150 security forces monday north of the capital , @entity197 , addressed " a specific area of concern and have contributed to the @entity182 's decision to resume operations			0
" @entity150 's state - run news agency , @entity202 , reported monday that two @entity141 suspects were killed and two others were injured in clashes with a @entity150 anti-terrorism unit			0
@entity210 investigators " gleaned usable , actionable intelligence " from @entity72 in the hours after his arrest , @entity10 press secretary @entity207 said tuesday			0
@entity207 declined to elaborate on the nature of the intelligence			0
@entity1 's @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
