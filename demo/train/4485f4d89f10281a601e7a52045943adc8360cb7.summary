-- in a victory for whale conservationist group @entity4 , @entity2 's government said thursday it is considering canceling the whaling season			1
if @entity2 does so , this would be the first time the country has canceled its whale hunt in the waters of the @entity10 since 2005 , when it began a bitter battle with the animal rights group			1
" in response to interference conducted by @entity4 , the @entity19 has temporarily halted the whaling hunt in the @entity21 , considering the crew 's safety as a first priority , " @entity14 , an official in charge of research whaling , said on thursday			2
" the ministry is considering what to do hereafter , but the total suspension of this season , which is scheduled to run until mid march , is included in the options			0

" as long as they 're here , we 'll be here , " he said from his ship in the @entity10			0
@entity2 has left its fleet of four whaling vessels in the @entity10 , as it decides what to do about the winter hunt , according to the ministry			2
the ministry announced wednesday that it was temporarily halting its controversial whale hunting season , blaming the @entity4 activists for impeding the hunt			1
@entity2 annually hunts whales , despite a worldwide moratorium on whaling , under the auspices it is conducting scientific research			1
the moratorium allows the culling of whales for purposes of scientific research			2
critics call @entity2 's hunt a cover for commercial whaling , since the whale meat ends up in supermarkets and restaurants			1
