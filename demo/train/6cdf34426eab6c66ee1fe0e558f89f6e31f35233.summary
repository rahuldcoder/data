@entity2 is a cancer that must be stamped out , @entity1 secretary of state @entity0 wrote saturday in an opinion piece for the @entity5			1
@entity0 called the @entity7 extremist group , known for beheadings , crucifixions and terror campaigns against religious and ethnic minorities , a " unifying threat to a broad array of countries " that needs to be confronted			2
his article appears in the aftermath of the political uproar that engulfed the @entity19 this week after president @entity20 said " we do n't have a strategy " on @entity2 in @entity22			2
@entity20 's no ' strategy yet ' comment on @entity2 in @entity22 sparks a political uproar the @entity26 in @entity27 and @entity22 , which calls itself the @entity26 , has grabbed headlines just as certainly as it has gobbled up territory across northern @entity27 over the summer			1
a companion opinion piece in the @entity5 , co-authored by @entity32 sens. @entity31 and @entity33 , concurred that @entity2 poses a serious threat , but argue for an immediate response with a military plan at its center			1
the @entity2 threat only grows over time , and @entity20 must act with more urgency , the senators wrote			2
" doing too little to combat @entity2 has been a problem			0
doing less is certainly not the answer now , " they wrote			0
the next move @entity1 airstrikes against @entity2 fighters have slowed their advance , and the @entity20 administration is weighing whether to expand the assault into @entity22			1
but , @entity0 said , any decision will require a joint effort with international partners			0
" with a united response led by the @entity1 and the broadest possible coalition of nations , the cancer of @entity2 will not be allowed to spread to other countries , " @entity0 wrote			1
" the world can confront this scourge , and ultimately defeat it			0
@entity2 is odious , but not omnipotent			0
" former @entity61 chief : matter of time before @entity2 tries to attack @entity63 @entity31 and @entity33 said the next move must include a squeezing of @entity2 financing , and a successful and inclusive @entity27 government that is inclusive of @entity27 sunnis , rather than pushing them toward terrorist groups			0
" but ultimately , @entity2 is a military force , and it must be confronted militarily , " the senators wrote			1
@entity20 has ordered airstrikes on @entity2 in northern @entity27 , but " they have been tactical and reactive half - measures , " @entity31 and @entity33 wrote			2
" continuing to confront @entity2 in @entity27 , but not in @entity22 , would be fighting with one hand tied behind our back			1
we need a military plan to defeat @entity2 , wherever it is			2
" building a coalition the secretary of state 's message echoes that of the @entity19 , with both the president and press secretary @entity85 calling this week for an international coalition to confront the threat			1
" airstrikes alone wo n't defeat this enemy			0
a much fuller response is demanded from the world , " @entity0 wrote			0
to build that coalition , @entity0 , along with defense secretary @entity93 , will meet with @entity95 allies on the sidelines of the @entity98 meeting in @entity99 next week			1
then , it 's off to the @entity101 to drum up support from the region			0
what can the @entity1 do against @entity2 in @entity22 -- and could it work ? " already our efforts have brought dozens of nations to this cause , " @entity0 argued in the @entity5 piece			1
" certainly there are different interests at play			0
but no decent country can support the horrors perpetrated by @entity2 , and no civilized country should shirk its responsibility to help stamp out this disease			0
" @entity2 : the first terror group to build an @entity120 state ?			2
