@entity0 has stepped up its efforts to transform 40,000 acres of land into a wind farm , in a bid to meet growing demand for electricity			1
the 300 mw @entity8 , which is being developed in the country 's @entity9 , hopes to produce 20 % of the country 's current installed electricity generating capacity when it comes online in 2016			1
the $ 694 million project achieved full financial close in december 2014 , making it the largest private investment in @entity0 history			1
" the success of this project , even though it has taken a long time to become successful , will inspire confidence in investors , " says @entity18 , @entity19 energy analyst at @entity20			1
" it 's a renewable plant -- which is harder to get right than other power plants -- and that it looks like it will be online relatively soon shows the government has got its priorities right			2
" the project is one part of the country 's ambitious project to add 5,000 mw of power onto the grid in the next three years			1
an international consortium of lenders and producers , which includes the @entity41 , @entity43 company @entity42 and @entity44 , is aiming to install 365 wind turbines			0
the 52 - meter blade span windmills will take advantage of high winds in the remote area			0
these breezy conditions are set to cause a jobs windfall			0
over the 32 months when the hardware will be installed and new roads built , the project will employ as many as 2,500 people on a temporary basis			2
once the wind farm is up and running , 200 people will be employed at the site on a full - time basis throughout the operating period			1
and such confidence in @entity0 's power sector was badly needed after disappointments elsewhere			1
the @entity68 power plant near @entity69 has suffered long delays after the procurement process failed to produce a viable partner for the government , who wanted to build the @entity75 facility in just 18 months			0
" if all goes well with the @entity8 project , as we expect , it will relieve some of the pressure on the country 's energy targets , " explains @entity18			2
power shortages the @entity8 investment , which is expected to generate $ 150 million a year in foreign currency savings to @entity0 , could have an impact on houses and businesses that are forced to use diesel generators during power black outs			1
indeed , in early january , a transmission line failure left over half the country without power for four hours			0
according to @entity97 , the country 's main electricity transmission company , there were three widespread interruptions of power affecting 75 % of the country in 2014			1
" in the first month of 2015 , we saw approximately nine interruptions per 1,000 customers in one month at the household level , " explains @entity101 , general manager of @entity102 at @entity97			0
" the plan is to bring that down to two interruptions per 1,000 customers by 2016 or 2017			0
" state - owned power company @entity110 produces approximately 80 % of electricity consumed in @entity0 , and of that , 65 % comes from hydro - power sources			1
it is @entity110 which provides the power to @entity97			0
" while blackouts in @entity118 are not so frequent as they once were , there is still an issue with electricity supply , " says @entity18			0
" the government will want to move away from reliance on hydro as rainfall patterns are unreliable in the region			0
" and as demand for electricity grows , that issue is not going away			0
electricity consumption grew by 9 % between 2010 and 2011 , according to the @entity129 and some estimates say demand will grow by a further 12 % by 2030			1
as well as adding to electricity supply , some businesses will also be hoping the @entity8 contributes to a decrease in power bills			2
according to the @entity136 , @entity97 will buy the power produced at the @entity138 at a fixed price over 20 years			0
regional powerhouse but it 's not just the east @entity19 country investing in renewable energy			2
according to @entity146 , @entity145 's @entity144 is planning a $ 13 billion expansion of wind , solar and hydroelectric power generation projects as part of the country 's goal to make renewables 42 % of the energy mix by 2020			1
@entity156 , meanwhile , is constructing the world 's fourth largest solar farm			2
the @entity162 project , in the country 's @entity159 , will have an installed capacity of @entity164 when it becomes operational later this year			0
while these projects will help build energy supply on the continent , the @entity165 has said @entity19 needs to invest $ 300 billion in order to achieve universal electricity access by 2030			1
once up and running , the @entity171 will have the largest amount of wind turbines on the continent , even more than the @entity177 wind farm in @entity145 , which is currently @entity19 's biggest wind farm with 131 turbines			1
it will also be larger than @entity182 power generating complex in neighboring @entity183 , which opened in october 2013			0
construction is set to begin early 2015 , but if the @entity185 does what it 's supposed to then @entity0 could be in for fewer blackouts and a more connected future			2
" we can expect the @entity8 project to bring change gradually , " says @entity97 's @entity101			0
" as demand for electricity grows , we will see electricity generated from wind turbines play a more important role in @entity0 's and reduce power costs in the country			1

@entity19 's largest wind farm is being built in @entity0
the $ 694 million project is the largest private investment in @entity0 history
electricity demand in @entity0 is expected to grow by 12 % by 2030
the extra power could reduce black outs which hit businesses hard
