@entity0 -- @entity2 again tuesday blocked @entity4 legislation that would require greater transparency into who is behind much of the secretive , often negative campaign advertising filling the airwaves this election season			1
supporters of the @entity11 mustered 53 votes in an effort to advance the bill , but fell short of the 60 needed to break a @entity16 filibuster			1
@entity4 unanimously supported the bill , while @entity2 voted unanimously against it			2
the legislation , which needs 60 votes to succeed , failed on a 51 - 44 vote monday			1
the legislation would require certain tax - exempt groups involved in political advertising -- which currently are not required to disclose the names of their donors -- to release the names of those who give donations of $ 10,000 or more			1
a similar vote monday ended with the same result			0
" during this election , outside spending by @entity16 shell groups is expected to top $ 1 billion , " said senate majority leader @entity32 , @entity33 , in a floor speech			0
" the names of these front groups contain words like ' freedom ' and ' prosperity			0
' but make no mistake : there is nothing free about an election purchased by a handful of billionaires for their own self - interest			0
" @entity51 's prepared statement @entity4 say the requirement is a much - needed response to the @entity57 @entity56 's @entity55 decision , which opened the doors to large amounts of campaign spending by corporations , labor unions and other groups			1
the political advertising all those donations buy " threatens to drown out the voice of middle - class families in our democracy , " argued sen. @entity64 , @entity65 , a chief sponsor of the bill			0
senate minority leader @entity74 , @entity75 , led the @entity16 charge against the bill and accused @entity4 of crafting it to favor labor unions -- traditionally @entity4 allies -- over other types of donors			1
@entity83 's statement " this legislation is an unprecedented requirement for groups to publicly disclose their donors , stripping a protection recognized and solidified by the courts , " said @entity83 , who has advocated for more disclosure in the past so long as it applies to all big players in campaign financing , such as labor unions and trial lawyers			1
@entity83 cited a recent @entity97 analysis that found labor unions spent $ 4.4 billion on campaigns between 2005 and 2011			2
@entity100 picks up campaign cash in the @entity102 " predictably , unions are exempted from the kind of disclosure democrats now want to impose on others , " @entity83 said			0
democrats disagreed with the @entity16 ' assertion that labor unions are exempt from their legislation			2
however , the concern about labor unions appeared to sway key @entity2 such as sen. @entity113 of @entity114 , a longtime vocal advocate of campaign finance reform , who said he would vote against the bill for that reason			1
@entity119 's full remarks " by conveniently setting high threshold for reporting requirements , the @entity11 forces some entities to inform the public about the origins of their financial support , while allowing others -- most notably those affiliated with organized labor -- to fly beneath the @entity131 's regulatory radar , " @entity113 said			0
@entity113 argued that local union chapters would not have to disclose payments from individual members if the amount was less than $ 10,000			0
fiscal cliff fight : missing the big picture opinion : why @entity4 need labor unions to sway voters , tens of millions spent on health care ads			2

@entity16 filibuster blocks @entity11 again
the @entity4 bill would require certain groups to disclose names of high - paying donors
@entity2 argue it favors labor unions over other types of donors
the legislation failed in a monday vote , 51 - 44
