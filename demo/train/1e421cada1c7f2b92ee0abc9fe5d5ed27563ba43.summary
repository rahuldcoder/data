-- new developments in the search for @entity3 over the weekend revealed more details about what happened before the plane went off the grid on saturday , march 8			1
but there are still major questions as investigators look for the missing aircraft			2
here 's a cheat sheet to help you get up to speed on the latest twists in what 's become one of the greatest aviation mysteries in history : what do we know about the plane 's altitude during the flight ? during the plane 's last contact with air traffic controllers as it was approaching @entity29 air space , it was reportedly flying at a cruising altitude of 35,000 feet			1
but military radar tracked it changing altitude after making a sharp turn as it headed toward the @entity35 , a source close to the investigation told @entity0			1
the plane flew as low as 12,000 feet at some point before it disappeared from radar , according to the source			1
the official , who is not authorized to speak to the media , told @entity0 that the area the plane flew in after the turn is a heavily traveled air corridor and that flying at 12,000 feet would have kept the jet well out of the way of that traffic			1
military radar tracked the flight between 1:19 a.m. and 2:40 a.m. the day it went missing , the source told @entity0 , but it 's not clear how long it took the plane to descend to 12,000 feet			1
why would a plane drop so drastically in altitude ? a mechanical problem could explain it , some analysts said			1
the new details about altitude are " highly significant , " said @entity62 , a @entity0 aviation analyst and former inspector general for the @entity65 @entity64			0
" it explains so many pieces that did n't fit together before , " she said			0
" now , if we have a scenario where something happened , the plane made a dramatic turn and dropped from 35,000 feet to 12,000 feet , this scenario would fit what a pilot would do in the event of a catastrophic onboard event , such as a rapid decompression , a fire , an explosion			1
that 's what you would have to do , descend , get down and turn around and try to get back to an airport that could accommodate an ailing plane			2
" but other analysts cautioned that it 's too soon to know and unclear whether the new information is reliable			2
" we 've had so much information come out and so much contradictory information come out , that i caution against jumping to any types of conclusions at this point , " said @entity89 , a former @entity90 pilot and @entity0 aviation analyst			0
how they 're searching for debris was the aircraft 's sharp turn programmed ? @entity102 authorities said sunday that the last transmission from the missing aircraft 's @entity104 and @entity106 showed it heading to @entity107			2
that information seems to be at odds with the supposition , reported heavily in many media outlets last week , that someone reprogrammed the plane 's flight path before the co-pilot signed off with air traffic controllers for the last time			1
" the last @entity121 transmission , sent at 1:07 a.m. , showed nothing unusual , " @entity102 officials said in a written update on the search			2
" the 1:07 a.m. transmission showed a normal routing all the way to @entity107			0
" this new information about the last transmission reduces , but does n't rule out , suspicions about foul play in the cockpit			0
and it is more in line with the theory that some sort of emergency on board forced pilots to change course , analysts said , but it 's still unclear what happened			1
who 's looking for the plane now ? countries from @entity143 to @entity144 are searching for the missing plane along arcs drawn by authorities based on satellite pings hours after it vanished			1
one arc tracks the southern @entity152 zone that 's the focus of current attention			1
the other arc tracks over parts of @entity156 , @entity157 , @entity158 and into @entity159			1
@entity144 is heading up the search in the southern zone , in an area about 2,500 kilometers ( 1550 miles ) southwest of @entity163			2
@entity144 navy ship @entity164 and 10 aircraft are participating in the search monday			2
the crew of a @entity158 search plane spotted " suspicious objects " in the area , @entity158 's state - run news agency @entity167 reported monday			1
the @entity158 plane has reported the coordinates of the objects to @entity144 authorities , as well as to the @entity158 icebreaker @entity176 , @entity167 said			1
if search crews do turn up anything confirmed to be from the plane , they 'll soon have more technology to help them			2
the @entity182 is sending a supersensitive hydrophone listening device to @entity144 to be on standby if debris from @entity3 is found and a search for the plane 's voice and data recorders can be done , a @entity65 military official said sunday			2
the device is pulled behind a ship at slow speeds and is used by the @entity182 to find downed aircraft to a depth of 20,000 feet			2
the equipment was moved to @entity196 in @entity197 on sunday and will be shipped to @entity144 via commercial air monday , the official said , emphasizing that the move does n't signal any change in the status of the search			0
what clues are pointing to the southern @entity152 ? @entity205 's @entity204 said sunday that radar data from a satellite pointed to floating debris in the @entity152 2,300 kilometers ( 1,430 miles ) from @entity163 , @entity144			1
the data were immediately passed along to @entity102 authorities , and @entity205 satellite resources will home in more on the area , the ministry said			0
satellite images previously issued by @entity144 and @entity158 authorities have also captured possible large floating objects in that area , stoking hopes that searchers might find debris from the missing plane			1
the satellite image from @entity158 , captured march 18 , shows an object that 's 22.5 meters long and 13 meters wide ( 74 feet by 43 feet ) , officials said			1
@entity144 - led search teams in the southern @entity152 found no sign of it saturday			1
have search teams found anything ? not much , but they did find a wooden pallet as well as strapping belts , the @entity228 's @entity227 said			0
the use of wooden pallets is common in the airline industry			0
" it 's a possible lead ... but pallets are used in the shipping industry as well , " he said sunday			0
the ocean is full of debris , and experts say that makes spotting possible wreckage more difficult			0
is that even the right place to be looking ? that depends on who you ask			0
@entity144 prime minister @entity249 , whose country is heading up search efforts in the southern arc , sounded optimistic over the weekend			0
" we have now had a number of very credible leads , and there is increasing hope -- no more than hope , no more than hope -- that we might be on the road to discovering what did happen to this ill - fated aircraft , " he said			0
analysts said sunday that the new details about altitude could mean that investigators are looking in the wrong spot			0
if the plane had been flying at 12,000 feet , @entity0 aviation analyst @entity89 said , it would have burned more fuel than it would at a higher altitude , which could mean projections about where it ended up are off base			1
" i do n't know that we 're necessarily searching in the right place , " @entity0 aviation analyst @entity275 said			0
" seeing some wooden pallets floating in the southern sea is not what i would call evidence of an aircraft			0
so , i think it 's quite possible that it could be in another place entirely , and maybe the search needs to be reevaluated			0
" can @entity286 help ? @entity286 is repositioning satellites to help look for the plane , but that could take a couple of days , the agency said sunday			0
the space agency said that it will check the archives of satellite data and use space - based assets such as the @entity296 - observing - 1 satellite and the @entity298 camera on the @entity299 to scour for possible crash sites			0
the resolution of these images could be used to identify objects of about 98 feet ( 30 meters ) or larger			2
listening for fading pings @entity0 's @entity305 , @entity306 , @entity307 , @entity308 , @entity309 , @entity310 , @entity311 , @entity312 , @entity313 , @entity314 , @entity315 and @entity316 contributed to this report .			0

new : a @entity158 flight crew spots " suspicious objects " in the @entity152 , state media report
source : the missing plane flew as low as 12,000 feet before it disappeared from radar
some analysts say that supports the theory that there was a mechanical problem
10 search planes are scouring the @entity152 for signs of the plane
