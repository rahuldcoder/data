-- @entity1 sometimes has a bit of a short - term memory problem			1
if something did n't happen , or was n't written , this day , this hour , this minute , then it 's easy for us @entity7 writers to pretend it did n't happen			0
or to forget about it and move on to the next post			0
the problem with this myopia , of course , is that history is a wise teacher , and all good reporting should build on a thoughtful understanding of the past and the present			0
that 's why i 'm asking for your help in creating a list of " must - reads " on the subject of income inequality			1
that topic , which you voted for me to cover as part of the @entity31 project , has been examined thoughtfully by countless writers , philosophers , historians , politicians , journalists , web designers and documentarians			1
as i embark on a series about inequality in the @entity42 , it makes sense to survey the smart , exciting works already out there			1
why not make the creation of this must - read list a collective , public experiment ? hopefully , we all can benefit from the process , and the list will be public so others can learn from it , too			1
submit your top picks via these @entity57 or @entity58 posts -- and make the case for why your favorite book , doc or website should be included			1
you can also leave a comment at the bottom of the page here if you prefer			0
my plan is to compile a list of 99 ( or so ) must - reads from your submissions			1
* i 'm using the term " must - read " loosely			1
i think the list should include books and articles as well as thoughtful websites , charts , videos or documentaries			2
to get things started , here are 10 of my picks , in no particular order : 1			2
" @entity83 " - this website from the @entity84 is the best online primer i 've found			2
it explains why inequality is a problem , how it was created and what might fix it			2
" @entity91 " - the 1971 book by the late @entity92 is often cited as the philosophical basis for opposing income inequality			1
it 's a dense book , but thought - provoking			2
" @entity94 " - a documentary by @entity97 winner @entity96			2
it uses the famous @entity99 as a metaphor for @entity42 inequality ; @entity94 is home to both extreme wealth , in @entity103 , and extreme poverty , in the @entity105			2
" @entity106 " - journalist @entity107 argues , as his book 's description says , that growing inequality " may be the most important change in this country during our lifetimes -- a drastic , elemental change in the character of @entity42 society , and not at all for the better			1
" @entity118 " - chances are you 're one of the 6.8 million people who has viewed this @entity123 video			2
it 's based on the work of @entity127 's @entity126			0
" inequality and @entity133 " - a @entity129 interactive , which maps median income levels by subway stops in @entity99			1
the power is in its minimalism			0
take a look at the 2 train map			0
it passes through neighborhoods with median incomes of $ 205,192 and $ 13,750			0
" @entity141 " - a first - person journey by writer @entity143 , who agreed to try to make a living doing jobs that required no higher education or specialized skills			0
" @entity155 " - @entity156 , from the wealthy @entity149 family , directed this documentary about his own life and the lives of his super-rich friends and acquaintances			0
it reveals a fascinating and complicated picture of wealth in modern @entity42			0
[ untitled letter ] - in march 2013 , 90 " economists , academics and development experts " sent a letter to a panel tasked by the @entity163 with creating a post- 2015 development agenda			0
the experts argue income inequality should be a global priority , in part , because " inequalities threaten our ability to pursue fair and sustainable development as much as they threaten eradication of extreme poverty			1
" @entity185 " - written by two epidemiologists , @entity187 and @entity188 , this book makes a strong , statistics - based argument that ugly social problems -- from obesity to incarceration rates -- are associated with unequal societies			0
better health and well - being would follow , they argue , if our societies were made to be more equal			0
this quickly thrown - together list has plenty of limitations			1
it focuses almost entirely on the @entity42 , particularly @entity99			0
all these works were published in 1971 or later , which is a huge weakness of my list			0
most of them presuppose inequality is a problem , or set out to prove that it is			0
so , conservatives , skeptics , historians , literary types and international readers : help me get some diversity going here ! i look forward to your submissions , and thanks in advance for the help with this project			1
* @entity220 of the @entity221 may notice that this concept of a crowdsourced must - read list is based on @entity225 's " @entity224 , " which he compiled in a similar manner in 2010			1
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity229 .			1

@entity231 is covering income inequality for the @entity31 project
help him compile a list of 99 " must - reads " on income inequality
