in a move sure to attract attention from the music industry , a small group of coders claiming to be part of @entity3 is putting together a social music platform			1
the rather ambitious goal : create a service that seamlessly pulls up songs streaming from all around the internet			1
the project , called @entity13 and still in its infancy , is designed to pull songs from third - party sources like @entity17 and let anonymous users put them into playlists and share them — while keeping the service from being shut down by music industry lawsuits			1
reached by e-mail , one of the creators of @entity13 told @entity26 the project was started by a group of anons who met online six years ago on what was then an underground hacking site			1
the group , mostly focused at the time on " cracking , " began discussing music , favorite artists and what they would do to fix current music business models			0
" we would say stuff like , ' people really use @entity17 as a music player yet it really sucks for that purpose ... it 's too unorganized , ' " the anon wrote to @entity26			0
" and then , ' @entity17 does make a good music player but you ca n't play all your songs on it since the obscure ones are n't uploaded , ' then eventually , ' hmmm , what if you were to combine music websites like @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity17 and others ? ' " on the ever - sprawling internet , music can pop up anywhere — @entity57 pages , blogs , @entity59 ( to name but a few )			1
almost any song is available at any time , whether posted by legitimate sources or uploaded by fans or pirates , and @entity13 would tap into that rich reservoir			1
it would n't be the first time @entity3 squared off with the record industry : when popular file - sharing site @entity69 was shuttered by the @entity71 in january , @entity3 retaliated by attacking the websites of the @entity73 and the @entity71			1
the @entity75 attacks provide an undeniable look at what @entity3 can do in a copyfight , but if the creators of @entity13 succeed , they could make something far more disruptive to the music industry			1
the @entity13 concept remained nothing more than talk until one day in early december , when an anon posted a link to @entity13 and said he planned to make their ideas a reality			1
the others looked at the site			0
although it was n't very good , the working prototype got enough people interested in the project that they " formed a team that day and stopped hacking , " the anon said			0
the platform has been in development for just a few months , according to the video above ( titled " @entity102 " )			0
although @entity13 is still very rudimentary , the service is meant to improve the way music is played online			1
" it has come to our attention that the state of online music has been sabotaged by the fat hands of corporate involvement , " the @entity13 video 's voiceover states			1
" these changes have led to a world in which your enjoyment of music is controlled and billed by the minute			0
" how @entity119 ( and a @entity120 ) @entity13 works by automating what most people do online manually			1
after setting up an account , users can build playlists by simply typing in the names of songs they want to hear , or they can choose from the names of songs imported from their ipods			2
@entity13 's " music engine " — which runs in a user 's browser — then finds the songs on the web			1
currently most of the tracks come from @entity17 and @entity138 , but there are plans in the works to add @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and others			0
from there , users , of which there are currently fewer than 1,000 , just press play			0
( a word of caution to curious readers : the system relies on executing a @entity155			0
unless you are extremely trusting or using @entity157 , you should think very carefully about running code on your machine that was written by members of @entity3			1
) the stated central aims of the service 's creators are to provide a flexible , open platform for users to listen to music without having to pirate it or face legal repercussions — read @entity13 's white paper here			1
true to form , users of the service can largely remain anonymous			2
although the site is still very crude and its origins obscure , the idea of @entity3 — even a few far - flung members of the group — tackling online music is compelling			1
but @entity13 could come into the world with a target on its back , even if it operates using completely legitimate methods , according to @entity185 attorney @entity184			2
" what we 're seeing here is a situation where the government is getting much more involved in enforcement , and we know that the @entity194 government does n't like @entity3 all that much anyway , " @entity184 said in an interview with @entity26			2
other music services can attempt to cut deals with music labels to avoid legal hot water , but that 's not really an option here			0
" i think content owners , if they feel like the site is a really viable site , they 're going to be pretty nervous [ about this ] , " @entity184 said			0
" because they like to have people that they can make deals with , and there 's no one to make a deal with in this situation			0
" it 's hard not to notice that @entity13 is popping up just as the @entity194 government 's case against @entity69 is getting heated			2
even though @entity13 's creators say the service is n't a rebuttal to the shuttering of the file - sharing service , its timely unveiling could serve as a model for a different way for @entity3 to respond to incidents ( as opposed to , say , directing @entity224 at the website of the @entity73 )			1
" the project is not so much a response to @entity69 but a response to the tycoons from the @entity73 shutting down music services , " the anon wrote to @entity26			0
" you may have heard about what @entity3 has done in @entity234			2
we believe the underlying reasons for the revolt were ( mostly ) correct , however their approach is unlikely to change anything in the long run			0
" when asked about @entity13 by @entity26 , an @entity73 spokesman declined to comment			2
@entity13 's creators hope that in its complete version — it 's only about 20 percent there so far , our source said — the service can improve the way people engage with music			1
" we have a lot of plans regarding this , " the @entity13 co-creator told @entity26			2
" the development of software to assist in achieving musical peak experiences , illumination of the functions and roles of music , psychometric testing based on music preference			0
it 's all there and this is possibly the most interesting part of the whole project			0
" @entity13 's technical aspects can be reviewed online , and the site 's operators are taking donations			2
even though its creators are still hurriedly trying to get the service up to snuff , the site has massive goals			0
one only needs to look at the final note on the above clip 's @entity17 page to get a taste			0
" we need to think bigger , " it reads			0
