-- as members of @entity2 navigate the shifting political sands of the debt - ceiling crisis , many of them are turning to a digital platform more associated with sharing personal updates and funny videos about cats : @entity11			1
in recent days , lawmakers have swarmed the popular social network to post videos outlining their positions , conduct opinion polls , reach new constituents and ask for feedback			1
" over the past week , our team has seen a marked increase in the number of members of @entity2 speaking directly to constituents through their official @entity11 pages , " said @entity18 , manager of public policy communications for @entity11			1
the number of posts including video or radio snippets also has increased over the past week as lawmakers seek to engage their followers in new ways , @entity18 added			2
as more members speak in front of @entity37 's cameras , he said , " we fully expect to see the pace of these postings pick up			0
" all of @entity40 speaker @entity39 's @entity11 posts in the past two weeks have articulated his positions on the debt crisis			1
it 's not clear whether they 're nudging the needle of public opinion , but they are sparking dialogue : a message by @entity39 on monday drew more than 15,000 comments			1
meanwhile , congressional democrats have used @entity11 to rally opposition to @entity39 's debt - ceiling bill			1
@entity55 whip @entity54 , @entity56 , posted a @entity37 clip of his comments from the @entity40 floor , while sen. @entity60 , @entity61 , asked @entity11 users to sign his online petition urging @entity2 to adopt a " sensible " bipartisan solution			1
observers say politicians have embraced social media platforms such as @entity11 and @entity68 because they allow them to communicate directly with constituents without having their messages altered			1
" you can convey emotion in a @entity11 update or a @entity75 video			2
it offers an authenticity , " said @entity76 , president of the @entity77 , a nonpartisan group dedicated to improving citizen engagement with @entity2			0
" they [ lawmakers ] are n't letting the dialogue be created by someone else			0
they 're creating the dialogue , " @entity76 said			0
" and they are very excited about avoiding the pesky media			0
" some members of @entity2 are addicted to the instantaneous feedback they receive on @entity11 and @entity68 , @entity76 said			2
" politicians long for public reaction , and they long to be loved , " he said			0
members of @entity2 also use @entity11 and @entity68 to quickly rebut published reports or opponents ' claims they disagree with			0
one challenge of communicating through unfiltered social media -- especially on hot - button political issues -- is that comments can degenerate into name - calling or worse			1
on friday rep. @entity103 , @entity104 , had to remind his @entity11 fans that profane , threatening or inappropriate comments would be deleted			2
so does all this social - media messaging by @entity2 really influence public opinion ? probably not , says @entity109 , assistant editor of the @entity110 , a website about the intersection of politics and technology			0
" it seems that while the population of @entity120 on social media is large and growing , folks who talk politics on social media are already polarized			1
you could think of it a little bit like being at a large party where the political junkies are huddled up in a back corner , talking amongst themselves , " he said			0
" how much gets from that group to their apolitical friends , i do n't know -- but one prevailing theory now is that @entity11 in particular makes it hard to breach that barrier			0
" @entity109 cited a recent book , @entity136 's " @entity135 , " which argues that @entity11 tends to surround users with like - minded friends and shield them from opposing views			2
that 's not stopping politicians from turning to the social network to get their message out			0
a recent survey of congressional staffers by the @entity77 found that nearly 75 % think @entity11 is " somewhat or very important " for communicating their members ' views , followed closely by @entity75 and less so by @entity68			2
" @entity11 has become a critical channel for government communication , " @entity18 said			0
" politicians are only getting more creative with social media as the the debate over the debt ceiling and other crucial public - policy issues continue			1

in recent days , lawmakers have swarmed @entity11 to outline their positions on the debt crisis
a post this week by @entity40 speaker @entity39 drew 15,000 comments
