-- in his @entity3 address , president @entity1 reaffirmed that the country 's war in @entity6 would be over by the end of 2014			1
he also laid out more specifics			0
of the approximately 66,000 @entity11 troops in @entity6 now , more than half -- 34,000 -- will come home in the next year , @entity1 said			1
at the same time , @entity6 troops will assume most of the responsibility for combat missions			1
" this spring , our forces will move into a support role , while @entity6 security forces take the lead , " @entity1 said			1
it was previously expected that @entity6 forces would take the lead in combat missions by the middle of this year			2
but a @entity11 official told @entity0 that the military transition has accelerated and that @entity6 will lead all security operations by march			1
what does this news mean for @entity6 and @entity11 's longest war ? here are some key questions that will be asked in the coming months : 1			1
are the @entity6 troops up to the task ? there are certainly doubts			2
a @entity36 review in december claimed that only one of 23 @entity6 army brigades was capable of functioning on its own			2
meanwhile , literacy rates are low , desertion rates are high , and many deserters have joined the insurgency			0
there also have been a troubling number of " green - on - blue " attacks : @entity6 troops attacking their @entity11 comrades			1
but defense secretary @entity49 has spoken positively about the progress @entity6 have made in growing their army , reducing violence and becoming more self - sufficient			1
@entity6 forces now lead nearly 90 % of operations across the country			2
" we 're on the right path to give ( @entity6 ) the opportunity to govern itself , " @entity49 said earlier this month			2
@entity6 president @entity59 said he welcomes the @entity11 troop withdrawal and insists his army can defend the country against the @entity63			1
" it is exactly our job to deal with it , and we are capable of dealing with it , " @entity59 said during an interview with @entity0 's @entity65			2
what the army needs now , @entity59 says , is more equipment and firepower			0
he came to the @entity36 last month with a wish list asking for more helicopters , drones and other hardware , according to a senior defense official			0
" we need an air force			0
we need air mobility , " @entity59 told @entity65			0
" we need proper mechanized forces			0
we need , you know , armored vehicles and tanks and all that			0
what presence will the @entity11 have after 2014 ? the plan is to withdraw all combat troops but keep a residual force in the country to help train @entity6 and carry out counterterrorism operations when needed			1
the size of that force is still being discussed			0
gen. @entity92 , the former commander of @entity11 troops in @entity6 , recommended between 6,000 and 15,000 troops			1
but that figure was lowered to a range between 2,500 and 9,000 , according to a defense official			0
there might not be any @entity11 troops at all if the @entity11 can not come to an agreement over immunity with @entity6			1
there was no @entity11 presence in @entity104 at the end of that war because the @entity104 government refused to extend legal protections to @entity11 troops			2
@entity59 , who 's in favor of a residual force , said he would put the immunity decision in the hands of @entity6 elders , and he expressed confidence that he could persuade the elders to see things his way			1
leaving no @entity11 troops at all would be a major misstep , said @entity120 , @entity0 's national security analyst			1
he said the @entity11 has abandoned @entity6 already , in 1989 , and the decision left @entity11 with little understanding of the power vacuum that led to the @entity63 's rise in the first place			1
" the current public discussion of zero @entity11 troop presence in @entity6 ... will encourage those hardliner elements of the @entity63 who have no interest in a negotiated settlement and believe they can simply wait the @entity11 out , " @entity120 wrote in an op - ed for @entity0			1
" it also discourages the many millions of @entity6 who see a longtime @entity11 presence as the best guarantor that the @entity63 wo n't come back in any meaningful way			1
what 's at stake ? the main fear among the @entity6 people is that the country could revert to another civil war once the @entity11 withdraws its combat troops			1
the @entity63 are still " resilient and determined , " according to a recent @entity36 report , and insurgents continue to carry out attacks and pose a major security threat			0
" some people we 've spoken to sort of take it for granted that there 's going to be a civil war when the @entity11 leaves , " said @entity0 's @entity150 on a recent trip to @entity6			1
" it happened before when the @entity157 left ( in 1989 )			0
" for all the violence @entity6 has seen in the past decade , it has also seen major advancements in human rights and quality of life			1
" during the @entity63 , basically there were thousands of girls going to school in @entity6			2
now you have millions of girls going to school , " @entity150 said			0
" so there 's been real progress on women 's rights			2
obviously there remain a lot of problems -- honor killings , forced marriages , domestic violence -- but there has been real progress			2
" retired army gen. @entity178 , once @entity11 's top commander in @entity6 , said the @entity6 people are " terrified			1
" " they 're terrified because they think they have something to lose , " @entity178 said			0
" there has been progress made			2
there is a better life			0
there are girls in school			0
there are things that are better than they were and opportunities potentially ahead			0
" but they 're afraid that if we completely abandon them in 2014 , as they perceive we did in 1989 , ( things ) would all go back			2
" and in @entity199 , there are worries that the wrong move could put the @entity11 right back where it started , with nothing to show for a bloody conflict that started in 2001			2
chairman of the @entity206 , rep. @entity207 , @entity208 , expressed concern last week that a hasty withdrawal could be " needlessly fraught with risk			2
" " since the president took the commendable step of deploying a surge to @entity6 in 2009 , we have known that our hard - fought gains are fragile and reversible , " @entity207 said			1
" that is n't my assessment , but the consistent opinion of experts both military and civilian			0
who will lead after @entity59 ? @entity6 's only president of this century wo n't be in charge for much longer			1
elections are scheduled for april 2014 , and @entity59 has reached the term limit set by his country 's constitution			2
he told @entity65 it 's " absolutely time to go			0
" " a new president will come to this country			0
a new government will come to this country			0
and i 'll be a happily retired civil servant , " he said			0
so while @entity6 oversees a major military transition , it also will have to make a political transition			1
who will lead the country during this critical moment in its history ? will the vote go smoothly , without violence and without controversy ? there were reports of ballot tampering and other violations in the last one			0
the answers might be just as important to @entity6 's security as the readiness of its troops			1
" the single biggest challenge for us is the political transition , the elections of 2014 , " said @entity254 , the media mogul behind @entity6 's @entity255			1
" ( if ) we have credible elections , i think we 'll be ok for the next five , six years			0
( if ) we do n't , there is a real danger that we 'll see instability , especially in 2014 as the @entity11 troops withdraw			1
what part will the @entity63 play ? despite the ongoing insurgency , @entity59 seems eager to resume stalled peace talks with the @entity63 and include them in the political process			0
the @entity63 pulled out of talks last year , but @entity59 said last month they " are very much conveying to us that they want to have peace talks			0
they also suffer , like the rest of @entity6 are suffering			2
" @entity277 , a @entity278 native now with the @entity279 of the @entity280 , believes revitalized peace talks are essential to @entity6 's future and to the legacy of @entity11 's war			1
" if withdrawing responsibly in 2014 is indeed high on president @entity1 's agenda , then he has little choice but to prioritize and accelerate the peace talks , negotiate a cease - fire between all sides , and reach a settlement that ensures that the @entity63 lay down their weapons , " @entity277 wrote in a recent column			1
but will the @entity63 be willing to cooperate ? and if they enter negotiations , how much of an influence would they have on an @entity6 society that has seen so many changes in the past decade ? " there have to be some red lines , " said @entity298 , @entity6 's deputy foreign minister for political affairs			1
" some of the achievements that we 've had in the last 10 years ca n't be negotiated			0
" @entity59 sounded confident that most of the @entity63 would acknowledge this			0
" i think there is now a critical mass in @entity6 of the educated , of the @entity6 people who want a future of progress and stability , " he said			1
" and i think also that the @entity63 recognize that this corner has been turned , the majority of them			0
some may be there among them who would not -- who would remain , you know , in the darkest of the mindset possible			0
but those are a few			0
" @entity0 's @entity320 , @entity321 and @entity322 contributed to this report .			0
