@entity1 , @entity0 -- paying for sex with trafficked or exploited women would become a crime under new laws proposed by the @entity8 government wednesday			1
under proposed laws , it would be illegal to buy sex from a trafficked or exploited woman in the @entity8			1
the act of purchasing sex is not currently a criminal offense in @entity0 and @entity16 -- although there are laws against paying for sex in a public place and persistently soliciting prostitutes			0
now @entity8 home secretary ( interior minister ) @entity22 says she is proposing the new measures to protect vulnerable women and tackle the demand for prostitution			1
@entity8 's interior ministry , known as the @entity28 , introduced the new measures wednesday after a six - month review that looked at what else the government could do to protect women being exploited for sexual gain			1
" i want to do everything we can to protect the thousands of vulnerable women coerced , exploited or trafficked into prostitution in our country , and to bring those who take advantage of them to justice , " @entity22 said in a statement			1
@entity22 said the new measures will shift the focus onto sex buyers because they create demand for prostitution and demand for the trafficking of women for sex			1
" there will be no more excuses for those who pay for sex , " she added			0
as part of the review , the government looked at the experience of other countries including @entity60 -- which has criminalized paying for sex -- and the @entity62 , where brothels are licensed			2
the government estimates around 80,000 people are involved in prostitution in @entity8 , with about 4,000 women having been trafficked for sexual exploitation			1
it says the prostitution market nationwide is worth up to £ 1 billion ( $ 1.52 billion )			0
trafficking is the movement of women from one place to another for the purposes of sex			2
@entity8 authorities have said trafficking usually involves the trafficker promising to bring a woman to @entity8 for a better life and then forcing her into prostitution			2
the measures -- which must be approved by @entity84 -- would mean that those committing the new offense would be given a criminal record and fined £ 1,000 ( $ 1,520 ) -- even if it was a person 's first offense and the offender did not know the prostitute was being controlled by a pimp or had been trafficked			2
police would also be given powers to close and seal premises suspected of being used for sexual exploitation , such as brothels , which the government said will prevent further exploitation and abuse from taking place			1
current law prohibits curb crawling , which involves soliciting prostitutes from a motor vehicle persistently or in a manner that causes annoyance to the neighborhood			0
it also prohibits " persistent soliciting , " which is essentially curb crawling without a car			0
but representatives of sex workers attacked the plans wednesday , saying they will force prostitution further underground and make women more vulnerable to violence			1
" it 's going to really make it more difficult for men to use the sex industry , and it 's going to mean that women are going to have to take more risks in order to earn the same money , " said @entity118 , a spokeswoman for the @entity119			0
" it 's also going to drive it underground			0
it 's going to increase the stigma			0
" @entity132 said the government 's figures are inflated , and that most immigrant women working as prostitutes have not been trafficked and are working independently			2
the new measures , she said , confuse prostitution with trafficking and take the focus off those women who may be vulnerable			1
" of women who may be trafficked and forced , what they need is to be able to come forward and report to the police without any fear of being deported , " @entity132 told @entity2			0
the new restrictions on curb crawling wo n't end the practice , @entity132 said , but simply give prostitutes less time to weigh up any potential dangers before getting in the client 's car .			0
