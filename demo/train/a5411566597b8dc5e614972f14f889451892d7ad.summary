-- do not try this on your next vacation			0
@entity5 authorities cracked down on climbing the @entity6 at @entity7 in the 1980s , but that did n't stop adventurer @entity9 and his friends from dodging local guards this year to take a few very hard - to - get shots from atop the @entity13			1
the @entity15 photographer said his motivation was simple : " we saw the old photographs of the @entity6 and decided to climb on it			1
" he also said he was n't aware of the risk and illegality , but reports that @entity9 's previous daredevil activities ( skywalking on the @entity24 ) landed him in custody suggest otherwise			0
but there 's no denying that the photos from his latest illicit romp are spectacular			2
is the photo better than the vacation ? @entity0 's @entity32 contributed to this report .			0

a @entity15 photographer *scaled* @entity5 's @entity13 on a recent visit
climbing the @entity6 has been *forbidden* for *decades*
the *resulting* photos *provide* a *rarely* seen *perspective*
