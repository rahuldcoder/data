-- he 's " the fastest man on no legs , " or -- as his sponsor 's high - profile advertising campaign put it -- " the bullet in the chamber			2
" he is @entity7 , the " @entity7 " who is changing the world 's perception of what is acceptable on an athletics track			1
born without a fibula bone in each leg , the @entity13 is the first double amputee to run at the world championships , and next year he will be the first to race at the @entity18			1
" i think next year 's going to be quite a big year , as far as demand on my performances , " the 24 - year - old told @entity0			1
" i feel that the condition i 'm in and the knowledge i 've gained probably will definitely help me in achieving those times in the first half of next season			0
so i know next year is going to be a big year			2
" @entity7 qualified for the 400 meters with a time of 45.07 seconds in @entity29 in july , which is less than two seconds slower than @entity31 's 1999 world record and would have given him fifth place in the final of the @entity34			1
@entity35 after @entity37 breakthrough he did not compete at the main event in @entity40			2
despite eventually reversing the decision by athletics ' ruling body to ban the carbon - fiber prosthetic blades he uses , the @entity42 native was unable to meet the qualifying mark			1
he did , however , run at the @entity49 that year , becoming the first athlete to win gold in the 100m , 200m and 400m			1
the @entity53 had at first decreed , after a series of tests , that the blades gave @entity7 an unfair advantage			1
he overturned that at the @entity59 , and maintains that he will be competing on a level playing field in @entity61 next year			2
" if the legs did provide such an advantage that some of the people are claiming they did , then there would be a lot more amputees using the exact same prosthetic legs i have , running the exact same times i have -- and that 's not the case , " @entity7 said			1
why @entity7 deserves to run he reached the 400m semifinals at the world championships in @entity74 in august , and then helped @entity13 's 4x400m relay team reach the final after setting a national record			1
however , he is still disappointed at being dropped from the line - up that secured a silver medal -- he made way for hurdler @entity81 after running the slowest split time as the lead - off runner			1
the @entity53 ruled @entity7 had to start out of the blocks , the slowest leg of the relay , " to avoid danger to other athletes			1
" runners can come out of their lanes in the other three legs			0
" it was very disappointing to me , because i know i worked very hard			0
i ran the second - fastest time i 've ever ran in the semifinal on my leg			2
it 's one of those things , unfortunately , " he said			0
" to walk away with a silver medal , although i did n't run in the final ... ( it ) was bittersweet to watch because i really felt i deserved to be on the team			1
" but at the same time the other four guys are very close friends of mine			0
when they came down that home straight i was losing my voice i was shouting so hard for them			0
it 's great to be a part of that			0
" the runner 's coach @entity7 believes @entity7 -- who already has lucrative endorsement deals with @entity112 , @entity114 perfume and @entity115 sunglasses -- can be a success on the biggest stage			1
" he 's a champion , and champions are born			0
i know it , i 've almost been going for 40 years in training and i can see it , " @entity7 told @entity0			2
" he 's got all the abilities of a champion and we did it gradually			0
it took us three months to get him out of the starting blocks , because he 's got no feet and no balance to stand still			0
so we must do a four - point start			0
@entity7 makes 400m @entity18 qualifying time while @entity7 is determined to prove himself against able - bodied athletes , he will also defend his @entity132 titles			1
" for me there is always a space for @entity132 sport			0
i am a very , very proud paralympian and when i 've had the platform or the opportunity to educate people about disability i 've done so without hesitation and i 'm very excited for the @entity49 next year , " he said			1
" i look at @entity141 as one of the highlights of my career			0
i ca n't wait to run in next year 's games and i still feel there 's a lot of recognition @entity132 athletes deserve that they 're not getting , and i 'm really fighting that			2
" despite his difficult start to life , @entity7 was keen on sport from an early age and competed in waterpolo , cricket , tennis , triathlons and @entity18 wrestling and boxing before he smashed his knee while playing rugby at the age of 16			1
he took up track running as part of his rehabilitation , linking up with @entity7			2
in his first year he was already running the 100m quicker than the existing @entity132 world record , and in 2004 he came to prominence by winning gold at the @entity171 in a new best time			1
by 2005 he had competed against able - bodied athletes for the first time , at the @entity175 , and did so internationally in 2007 before the @entity53 intervened			1
in february 2009 , @entity7 suffered serious head injuries in a boating accident that slowed down his track progress			2
" that was fairly difficult for me			0
it was kind of strange because i was in very good form -- and i was in hospital for a couple of weeks and then when i got home i could n't train , " he said			0
" through my recovery , it took me probably six to eight weeks where i was n't able to train at all			0
it was just very difficult getting into the swing of things , it was the first season in four or five years that i had n't run a personal best , but it was a bit of a learning curve i guess			0
" but after a life of overcoming adversity , the setback was just another step in his growth -- adding to an attitude best summed up on his website : " you 're not disabled by the disabilities you have , you are able by the abilities you have			0

@entity7 will be the first double amputee to compete at @entity18
@entity13 has already been first to run at @entity205
his carbon - fiber prosthetic blades were *temporarily* banned by the @entity53 in 2008
the 24 - year - old is a *multiple* gold medal winner at the @entity49 since his 2004 debut
