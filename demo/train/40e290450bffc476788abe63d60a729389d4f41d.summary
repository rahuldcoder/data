-- so , when can we expect our refund checks ? because two can play this game			1
on the one side of the federal government shutdown are the people whose job it is to run that government : the @entity11 and the @entity12			1
democrats , republicans , conservatives , liberals -- no one forced any of them to take those jobs			0
on the other side -- at least in a rational world , which this is n't -- is us			1
@entity11 still gets paid -- it 's in the @entity31 we pay federal income tax with one solitary and bedrock expectation : we are handing our money over so that the federal government will run			1
some people may not like how the government operates ; some may not care for a particular president or a particular member of @entity11 or a particular government program			2
we accept that , as we pay our taxes			2
we pay those taxes because we have to			2
we know that we do n't get to withhold those taxes just because we may dislike some of the people or programs the taxes are funding			1
but when we are told that the government has been shut down -- that it has been closed for business -- that 's different			1
we paid for that service			0
@entity52 hurt as @entity54 ' squabbles like kids ' if we had paid for an airline ticket , and in the middle of our trip the airline informed us that one leg of our journey had been canceled , we would justifiably demand a refund			1
if we ordered an annual subscription to 52 weeks of a magazine , and then , a few months into it , the magazine told us that its new policy was to publish only 26 issues a year , we would , with good reason , ask for half of our money back			2
if we paid for a one - year membership in a health club , and the club announced that it would have to close for repairs for three months , we would expect a 25 % refund			2
so ... exactly when can we expect to see our refund checks from the federal government ? we have paid for it to operate			1
and -- with the exception of what , for now , are being deemed certain essential functions -- it is not operating			0
opinion : shutdown could be shock therapy the people we have paid to operate it can blame each other all they want for what has happened			2
they can point fingers and say that it 's all the other guys ' fault			0
but whoever ultimately shoulders the blame , the fact is that the people who hired them -- the @entity52 taxpayers -- are not getting what they paid for			0
so the refunds , for the portions of government operations that have been shuttered , are owed			1
or at least they should be owed , in any other kind of sane business			0
the longer the shutdown continues , the larger the refunds should logically become			0
as if logic has had anything to do with any of these developments			0
@entity11 and the @entity12 might hear this request and say : that 's preposterous			0
the government is hurting for funds -- it needs the money			0
well , many of the people who pay for the government to run are hurting for funds , too			0
they need the money , too			0
the government , no matter what anyone thinks of its various policies , no matter where anyone positions himself or herself along the political and ideological continuum , is expected to do one thing : open its doors each morning			1
when it does n't , the people who paid for it to do just that have a right to propose that they are owed -- for services not rendered -- their money back			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity137 .			1

it 's taxpayers who finance government operations , writes @entity137
now that much of government is shutdown , we *deserve* a refund , he says
*consumers* would demand refund from other *providers* who did n't provide services , he says
@entity137 : government is expected to open its doors ; if not , give us our taxes back
