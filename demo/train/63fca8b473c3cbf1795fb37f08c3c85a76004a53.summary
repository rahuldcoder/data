" one morning there was a kid that was picked from school early in the morning because her sibling had died in a fire , " she says			0
" [ the kid ] had lit a candle in the house and then went outside to do some other chores , so the candle melted away and the house was all on fire			0

" in @entity7 , some 90 % of the population lives without access to electricity , according to @entity49 figures			0
apart from the health risks , @entity1 , 50 , says that lack of electricity is also preventing people from escaping poverty			2
" people that are living without electricity , their day ends up so quickly -- they can do less work compared to the people with full light , " she says			0

" so far , more than 270 entrepreneurs in @entity7 , @entity196 and @entity197 have joined solar sister			1
@entity88 says the group , which is looking to expand in other counties in the continent , is deliberately working solely with women as they are responsible of managing the energy needs of a household			1
" women are the ones who walk miles to cut the wood ; women are the ones who go to markets to buy kerosene -- so if we wanted to make the change that someone would say ' well , i 'll quit the kerosene , i 'm going to buy a solar lamp and use cleaner technology , ' then it had to be the person who was in charge of making that decision and that 's the women			1
