@entity0 -- acting at the request of an air traffic controller , the pilot of a @entity5 @entity4 pulled within one - tenth of a mile of a small , four - seat aircraft last month to check on pilot of the smaller plane , who had not responded to radio calls , the @entity2 said friday			1
the march 27 incident was publicized days after it happened , when federal aviation administrator @entity14 suspended the air traffic controller , for " compromising the safety " of the planes ' occupants			1
but the details released friday for the first time show just how close the two planes came			1
according to the @entity2 , the planes came within 0.1 miles of each other , far closer then the required separation of three miles			1
they also were separated by 100 feet in altitude , less than the 1,000 feet required , the @entity2 reported			2
the incident happened 11,000 feet over @entity27 , when controllers at the @entity29 , a regional radar facility , were unsuccessful in contacting the pilot of the @entity32 , which was en route to @entity34 , @entity27			1
the plane had been out of radio contact with the @entity37 for more than an hour			1
a @entity29 controller sought the assistance of @entity5 flight 821 , which was then 10 miles from the smaller aircraft , asking the @entity5 pilot " to attempt to verify the condition of the occupants " of the @entity32 , the @entity2 said			2
the @entity5 pilot " obliged , " and controllers guided the jetliner towards the unresponsive plane			1
a separate radar scope was set up and a single frequency was used by a front - line manager who provided instructions to the @entity5 jet			0
when the @entity5 jet was about five miles from the smaller plane , the pilot reported seeing the plane visually and on a collision avoidance system			1
the jet " maneuvered on his own alongside of " the smaller plane , the @entity2 said			2
the crew reported seeing " two occupants in the @entity32 and no apparent movement from them " before being vectored away to its @entity59 destination			0
the @entity62 said both planes landed safely			0
@entity5 reported in march that it had suspended the pilot of the jetliner pending an investigation			2
both the @entity62 and @entity2 are investigating			0
neither has issued any findings or conclusions			0
aviation authorities say the protocol for intercepting unresponsive aircraft is to scramble military jets			0
" by placing this passenger aircraft in close proximity to another plane , the air traffic controller compromised the safety of everyone involved , " @entity62 administrator @entity14 said in a statement in march			2
" this incident was totally inappropriate			0
" " we are reviewing the air traffic procedures used here and making sure everyone understands the protocols for contacting unresponsive aircraft , " @entity14 said			0
@entity5 said the flight had 137 passengers and a crew of five .			0
