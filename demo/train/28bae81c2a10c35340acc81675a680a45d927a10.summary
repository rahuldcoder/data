@entity0 is fighting to block rockets from striking its major population centers , deploying its @entity5 missile defense system to intercept them			1
by wednesday afternoon , since the start of @entity9 , the @entity7 said missiles from the system had intercepted 56 rockets fired out of @entity13 , preventing strikes in @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and elsewhere			0
more than 250 rockets have been fired out of @entity13 toward @entity0 in that time , the @entity7 said			1
@entity0 uses the @entity5 system only against rockets headed toward populated areas			1
if one appears to be headed for an empty field , the dome does not activate			0
the system is a centerpiece of @entity0 's defense strategy			1
how does it work ? the name @entity5 evokes an image of a protective bubble over a city			0
in practice , it targets incoming rockets and fires an interceptor missile to destroy them in the air			1
each battery has a firing - control radar to identify targets			1
it also has a portable missile launcher			1
the system is easily transportable , with just a few hours needed to relocate and set up			0
the missile is highly maneuverable			0
it is 3 meters , or almost 10 feet , long ; has a diameter of about 6 inches ( 15 centimeters ) ; and weighs 90 kilograms , or 198 pounds , the security analysis group @entity48 's said in 2012			0
the warhead is believed to carry 11 kilograms , or 24 pounds , of high explosives , @entity51 's said			0
its range is from 4 kilometers to 70 kilometers , or 2Â½ miles to 43 miles			0
@entity5 confronts multiple threats simultaneously , in all weather conditions , the military said			1
@entity0 credits " breakthrough technology " and the system 's radar			1
" the radar detects a rocket launch and passes information regarding its path to the control center , which calculates the predicted point of impact , " the @entity7 said			2
" if this location justifies an interception , a missile is fired to intercept the rocket			0
the payload of the interceptor missile explodes near the rocket , in a place that is not expected to cause injuries			1
" what are the origins ? @entity0 began developing the ground - based system in 2007			1
after a series of test flights in 2008 and 2009 , the first deployment of a battery occurred in southern @entity0 in 2011			2
the @entity85 reported an interception success rate of 70 % in 2011 , @entity51 's said			0
is the @entity87 involved in @entity5 ? yes			0
the initial development was solely by @entity0 's defense technology company @entity90 , but the system has since been heavily sponsored by the @entity87			2
in 2014 , the @entity87 provided $ 235 million for @entity5 research , development and production , according to the @entity95			0
" this is a program that has been critical in terms of providing security and safety for @entity0 families , " president @entity96 has said of @entity5			1
" it is a program that has been tested and has prevented missile strikes inside of @entity0			2
" each @entity5 battery costs $ 50 million , @entity51 's said			2
a missile costs at least $ 62,000 , @entity0 officials said			2
other countries have expressed interest in buying the system , including the @entity87 , @entity111 and several @entity113 countries in @entity114 with military forces in @entity116 , the @entity107 has reported .			0
