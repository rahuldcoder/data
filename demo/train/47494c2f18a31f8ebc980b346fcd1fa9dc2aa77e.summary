@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 stops at the edge of the treeline , where the meadow becomes a forest			1
his yellow linen shirt is misbuttoned and crooked , leaving the bottom of his belly slightly exposed			2
his 8 - year - old daughter , @entity12 , stands a foot or so behind him , wiping her runny nose with the sleeve of her blue sweatshirt			1
after about a minute , she lets out a sigh of boredom			2
@entity19 , 51 , clasps his daughter 's hand and begins leading her into the @entity1 forest			1
" this is where your ancestors are buried , back here , " @entity3 says			1
" c'mon , i 'll show you			2
" and with a loving tug , @entity19 shares with his daughter a key piece of their family 's history			1
still holding hands , the pair weaves through the maze of thin pines , stepping over fallen oaks and basketball - sized sinkholes			2
@entity12 stays silent while her father seems singularly focused on moving forward			2
after five minutes , they reach a large clearing where rows of fist - sized rocks bulge out of the ground			2
each rock sits atop small depressions in the ground			2
" you see those humps in the ground ? " @entity19 asks			1
" uh-huh , " @entity12 replies			2
" those are rows of graves			2
they 're stacked like spoons here , " @entity3 says			1
" there was a lot of people here			1
people of the 1800s are buried here			1
and i 'm trying to keep it in your memory the way granddaddy kept it in mine so it wo n't be forgotten			2
" the two crouch over a large , flat rock with the words " @entity74 , 4 " scratched into it			0
to the left of the marker is a row of 12 rocks			0
to the front , there are four other rows of stones , varying in number			0
" how long did they bury our kin here ? " @entity12 asks			0
" they started in the early 1800s , baby , " @entity19 answers			1
" they worked our people to death here			1
and probably about 1905 is when they stopped burying in this area			0
your great - great - great grandfather , a ( slave - owning ) man named @entity98 , he had five children by this slave woman , your great - great - great grandmother			0
she is buried over here on this side			1
" @entity12 's light green eyes get big			0
" i 'm worried i might step on them , " she says			0
" oh , baby , " @entity3 says with a laugh , " they 're gone			1
they 're gone ! they 're sleeping right now , waiting for the lord to come			0
" a " rare " and " special " place the @entity19 gravesite is in the @entity117 foothills outside @entity0 , @entity1			1
about 1,000 feet from the clearing is an old , abandoned church on a dusty dirt road			0
experts say that if slaves or former slaves are buried at the site , it would be a unique archeological find			1
" in @entity130 , it would be extremely rare to have a black or slave graveyard , " explained @entity127 , co-author of " @entity128 : three centuries of @entity133			1
" " the farms in @entity130 were small , and there were fewer slaves			0
" @entity127 says slave cemeteries in the area would have been marked with field stones , like the rocks at the site , or wooden stakes that burned down			0
" it 's very regional and very local , " @entity127 continued			0
" i 've seen on the coastal area with graves marked with seashells			0
" other grave markers used in black burial cites throughout the @entity149 include iron pipes , broken dishes , cups , bottles and live cedar trees , according to @entity156 executive director @entity155			1
he specializes in cemetery preservation			1
" the problem with preserving these types of sites is that @entity162 cemeteries are hard to find , " @entity155 said			1
" you can think of the people buried there as the invisible dead			1
and not knowing where they are , or how many there are , makes them susceptible to loss			0
" even if gravesites are recognized , they still might be destroyed for development			0
@entity155 points to the low country of @entity175			0
" the areas that were used for burial grounds , " @entity155 explained , " those areas were close to water			1
they were considered waste areas , places where burying slaves was n't a significant loss to the planter			0
those areas today are among the most sought - after for real estate			0
" officials in @entity190 , where the site is located , say that they are unaware of any grave sites in the hills near @entity0 and that the site needs to be registered with the library as a cemetery before it can be considered for protection through local ordinances			1
@entity155 and @entity127 both say the potential historical importance of grave sites warrant investigation by local or state officials			1
" what if in that grave was your mother or your child ? " @entity155 asked			2
" it 's an issue of respect and an issue of dignity			0
it 's the last decision society and the individual make together			0
" " there are n't many traceable slave graveyards , and each one is special in it 's own way , " @entity127 added			0
she says the @entity19 family can point to that spot and say , " this is where we 're from ; this is where our roots are			1
" two cemeteries for two ancestors shortly before sunset , @entity12 and @entity19 head over to an old white cemetery about a mile from the forest gravesite			1
the dates on the gravestones suggest that it was used around the same time as the forest cemetery			1
there , @entity19 and @entity12 walk over to a marble headstone that tops 10 feet			1
in front of it is a small plastic @entity241 flag flapping in the breeze			0
... he was one of the colonels in the @entity247 for the @entity241 , " @entity3 says			1
" he had five children by way of a slave he owned by the name of @entity105			0
" " my great - great grandmother ? " @entity12 asks			0
" your great - great - great grandmother , " @entity19 corrects her			1
he turns to point toward another grave site when @entity12 notices her father 's misbuttoned shirt			2
she stops him mid-sentence and begins to fix the crooked buttons			0
" why is @entity105 buried over there and @entity98 over here ? " she asks			2
" because that 's the way it was , @entity263 , " @entity19 answers			1
@entity12 's face is filled with intense concentration as she tries to undo the bottom button on her father 's shirt			0
finally , she pries the button free			0
she looks up at her father and says assuredly , " but people are people			2
it does n't matter what they are			0
they 're all the same			0
" " that 's a good thing to think , but back then it was n't like that , @entity263 , " @entity3 tells her			1
" the dark - skinned people were buried way back over yonder , and the light - skinned people were buried here			1
" @entity12 finally fixes her father 's shirt , leaving it straight			0
then , she skips over to the other end of the cemetery			2
@entity19 watches her race across the lot			1
" you ca n't do well in life if you do n't know your history			0
without your history , you 're nothing , " he says			0
@entity12 playfully hides behind a large headstone , calling for her daddy to chase her			0
a quarter - way toward her , he stops , turns around and yells back , " i reckon she 'll be buried wherever she wants to			2

@entity3 takes daughter @entity299 to see where ancestors are buried
the family grave dates to the 1800s , @entity19 says
@entity306 used in black burial sites include iron pipes , broken dishes , trees
people were buried in different parts of the cemetery based on skin color , @entity19 explains
