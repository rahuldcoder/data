@entity1 officials insisted tuesday they were holding on to a key oil refinery while making gains elsewhere against militant fighters			1
the deputy prime minister for energy affairs , @entity5 , denied media reports that militants had taken the @entity9 oil refinery , saying that security forces are still fighting militants at the site			1
the state - run @entity14 news agency also claimed that security forces still controlled the refinery			0
@entity1 special forces killed the militant who led the attacks against the refinery , who goes by the name of @entity22 , @entity14 said			1
airstrikes also killed 19 militants , the news agency reported			0
the reports run contrary to earlier statements to @entity27 by @entity1 security sources who said militant fighters believed to be from the @entity30 in @entity1 and @entity31 , or @entity32 , had seized the refinery			2
the @entity9 refinery , in northern @entity34 province , is a crucial resource because it refines much of the fuel needed for domestic consumption			2
long lines have already formed at many gas stations across the country			0
crisis in @entity1 : latest developments @entity45 officials say they think @entity32 now has as many as 10,000 fighters in @entity1 and @entity31 -- including those who have broken out of prisons -- and loyalists who have joined the fight as the group has advanced , several @entity45 officials have told @entity27 in recent days			1
it is unknown , officials say , exactly how many are in @entity1 because it 's not clear how many go back and forth across the @entity31 border and how many loyalists have joined @entity32 as it took over various towns			2
the group is functioning as an " increasingly capable military force , " one official said			1
but questions remain about whether the group may become stretched too thin as it tries to hold on to its growing territory			0
@entity1 's military spokesman , maj. gen. @entity63 , said that security forces had regained control of two key border crossings after briefly losing them to the militants			2
in a briefing in @entity70 aired on state tv , @entity63 said @entity1 forces , aided by @entity74 tribes , retook @entity75 , which connects @entity1 with @entity31 -- as well as the @entity77 border crossing between @entity1 and @entity78			2
he also said that all towns between @entity81 and @entity70 , 80 miles ( 129 kilometers ) to the south , are in the hands of @entity1 security forces			2
the @entity85 border crossing , which is some 217 miles ( 350 kilometers ) to the north of @entity75 , remains under the control of militants			0
on monday , a spokesman for @entity1 's counterterrorism service told @entity27 that two senior @entity32 figures -- an @entity93 militant named @entity94 and @entity95 , the self - styled governor of @entity96 -- were killed late monday in airstrikes in @entity96 , the hometown of former @entity1 leader @entity98			0
the spokesman , @entity99 , offered no evidence of the deaths			0
@entity27 can not independently confirm any of the claims			0
meanwhile , in @entity104 , gunmen killed the head of the city council			0
@entity107 died when they opened fire on his car as he drove			0
@entity110 arrives in @entity111 @entity45 secretary of state @entity110 visited @entity111 on tuesday to discuss with @entity1 @entity113 president @entity112 and other officials how @entity113 can help the central government tackle security and political challenges			1
as the two men sat down to meet , @entity112 said , " we are facing a new reality and a new @entity1 , " on monday , @entity112 said in an exclusive interview with @entity27 's @entity120 that this may be the time for @entity113 to push for their long - sought independence -- saying " @entity1 is obviously falling apart			1
" " and it 's obvious that the federal or central government has lost control over everything , " @entity112 said monday			0
" everything is collapsing -- the army , the troops , the police			0
" @entity112 's exclusive interview with @entity120 @entity111 is the seat of the @entity113 regional government			1
@entity1 prime minister @entity136 's @entity135 - dominated government is accused of fostering sectarian tensions by marginalizing the country 's @entity113 and @entity74 minorities			1
in an interview tuesday with @entity27 's @entity141 , @entity110 praised @entity113 leaders for their " organized and focused and disciplined leadership , " saying it has resulted in economic vitality			1
" the rest of @entity1 ought to look like this , " he said			0
in the interview , @entity110 did n't mention @entity113 independence			1
but he said forming a new government that represents the interests of all of @entity1 's ethnic and religious groups is a crucial precursor to whatever action the @entity45 might take to intervene in the crisis unfolding there			1
" the key is , if you do n't have a viable government that is a unity government that is not going to repeat the mistakes of the last few years , whatever we might choose to do would be extraordinarily hampered , " @entity110 said			1
" it would be very difficult to be successful if you were just engaged in some kind of military activity , because there 's no ultimately just a military solution there			0
" he rejected any notion that failure to intervene militarily in @entity1 , or before that in the war in @entity31 -- where @entity32 has gained much of its strength -- has led to the current crisis			2
" ... you 've got to have a holistic , comprehensive approach , and the president is trying , as we are , i am , whether or not @entity1 is prepared to be part of that , " he said			0
the @entity45 is expected to have about 300 military advisers in @entity1			1
on tuesday , 90 arrived from outside the country , said @entity184 spokesman rear adm. @entity183			0
they will join the 40 other @entity45 troops already in @entity1 , who were working at the embassy in @entity70 and have been reassigned			1
the advisers are expected to assess the situation on the ground and then " advise and assist " @entity1 military forces as they counter the threat from @entity32 militants , @entity183 said			2
@entity110 's comments came amid news reports claiming the @entity45 had launched drone strikes in @entity1			1
@entity183 denied the reports in a statement tuesday , saying that " no such action has been taken			0
" while the @entity45 weighs what steps it will take , some @entity1 told @entity141 that they would welcome back @entity45 troops three years after their departure			1
" @entity45 will not accept the presence of @entity204 and ( @entity32 ) in the region because that will impact on the @entity208 region and the @entity210 states			0
it will have an effect on @entity45 , too , " resident @entity211 said			0
" therefore , i think there is a solution in @entity110 's bag to solve the crisis			2
" destination unknown : will @entity113 use oil to break free from @entity1 ? @entity221 - born jihadists rally to @entity32 's fight in @entity1 and @entity31			1

militants , who may number up to 10,000 , are " increasingly capable , " @entity45 official says
fight for @entity9 oil refinery continues , deputy prime minister for energy affairs says
@entity110 visits @entity111 to speak with @entity113 leaders about the @entity1 crisis
the @entity45 is " extraordinarily hampered " without a new @entity1 government , @entity110 says
