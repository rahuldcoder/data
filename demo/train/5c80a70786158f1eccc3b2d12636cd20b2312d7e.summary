-- @entity1 is like no other place i 've been			1
the city 's character is influenced by former @entity7 colonial rule , by its deep natural harbor , and its rapid growth and culture of consumerism as one of @entity14 's major financial hubs			1
its 7 million inhabitants literally live on top of one another in high - rise apartments that stretch as far as the eye can see			0

fair warning : many of the trails are steep , and some have stairs that go on forever			0
one of my favorite places to hike is @entity92 's south side			0
@entity93 , a gorgeous ridge trail , is a great place to catch stunning views and a nice sea breeze , and ends near the charming beach village of @entity99 if you 're up for a real challenge , start at @entity103 dam and hike to " @entity104 " for a double dip of very steep climbing that leads to unforgettable views of the south side 's beaches			0

island hop @entity1 's outlying islands are the perfect escape from the crowded streets and just a quick ferry ride away from @entity168			1
@entity169 is a charming , laid - back island dotted with fishing villages , incredible seafood , coffee shops , hiking trails and hidden beaches			1
cars are n't allowed , so expect to see lots of bikes and dog - friendly families			0
a little farther out is @entity181 , where you can leisurely explore the @entity183 and sample dried fish at one of the many butcher shops and fish vendors in the central district of this mostly quiet residential island			2
