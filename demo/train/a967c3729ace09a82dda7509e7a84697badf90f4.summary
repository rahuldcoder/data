@entity0 -- talking excitedly and pacing the front of her classroom , @entity1 engages her students			0
" what are different paces you can go when you 're reading aloud ? @entity8 ? " @entity1 , in her @entity0 classroom , says she now wants to make teaching her career			0
" " okay , low or soft , yes			2
" on the first day of school , most of the kids in @entity1 's eighth - grade class could not read at a sixth - grade level			2
with summer almost here , it 's a totally different story for these kids , who according to their school are expected to read at or near grade level			0
" it is an incredible thing for these students			0
" @entity1 graduated with honors from the @entity26			0
she arrived at @entity27 , the multicultural magnet school in the @entity29 , @entity0 , two years ago with a degree in political science and a desire to change the world			0
" when i found out about @entity34 , " she said , " i realized that teaching would be such an incredible way to make an impact			1
" @entity34 is like a local @entity38 serving some of the country 's poorest public schools in inner cities and in rural areas			1
it has grown every year since its inception in 1990 , sending 20,000 college graduates into the nation 's neediest classrooms for a two - year commitment			1
this year , amid a tight job market , it is more popular than ever			2
according to the organization 's web site , their teachers get paid the same salary and benefits as beginning teachers in their area and are paid by the local school district			2
about 35,000 college seniors applied for the 2009 school year , a 42 percent jump from last year			1
" we had less competition from @entity63 firms , banks and places like that			2
it just led a lot of students to really think about what they wanted to do and how they could make an impact , " said @entity67 , executive director of @entity34			1
" eleven percent of the entire @entity76 senior class applied to join , 20 percent of @entity78 seniors at @entity76 schools , 8 percent of the @entity80 and @entity81 , " @entity67 said , " just an incredible outpouring of interest by people competing to teach in low - income communities			1
" @entity86 went through the program and now recruits for @entity34			1
he sees education as this generation 's civil rights issue and says there is a direct correlation between the program 's popularity and president @entity97 's call to service			0
" with @entity97 talking about the need for people with talent to go into public education , and the fact that people are still really frustrated that we live in a country where 90 percent of kids in low - income communities do n't go to college , and that the best way we can predict the number of prisons we 're going to have to build in 25 years is by looking at third - grade reading skills , and so at this particular moment in time , i think it 's really about getting our very best and asking them to go to the root of the problem , and the root of the problem is education			1
" this year , @entity34 will place its largest corps ever			1
about 4,100 high achievers from the nation 's top colleges will head to classrooms in 34 regions across the country , teaching in places like @entity130 , @entity131 ; @entity132 , @entity133 ; @entity134 , @entity135 ; @entity136 , @entity137 ; and in more rural areas such as @entity139 and the @entity140			1
but schools in @entity142 and elsewhere desperately need help			0
@entity67 said , " districts across the country are facing the same economic pinch that many businesses are facing			0
and there are just fewer positions across the country available for teachers			0
" which is why a teachers union says those positions should go to career teachers , not inexperienced recruits who may stay only the required two years			0
" it 's very hard to justify laying off teachers who have given service to a school system and then turn around and bring in new teachers , " argued @entity156 of the @entity157 , the nation 's largest professional employee organization for the advancement of public education			0
besides the matter of taking away potential jobs from career teachers , unions question whether these young recruits have the right credentials and experience to handle tough classrooms			1
" when you 're assigning these teachers to the highest poverty schools , the most challenging schools , these children need the most experienced , the most prepared teachers , and they 're not getting them , " @entity156 said , " and that 's quite a disadvantage			1
" @entity34 maintains that its members go through a rigorous five - week training camp and that while on the job , many pursue a teaching certificate or master 's degree in education			1
@entity0 will be taking 330 corps members into its schools this year			2
@entity188 , who is in charge of teacher recruitment and quality for the city 's @entity192 , says teachers coming in through alternative programs , like @entity34 , perform as well as teachers from traditional routes			1
" they serve some of our highest - need children , both in terms of neighborhoods that we have difficulty attracting traditionally prepared teachers and in subject areas where we have difficulty , that teacher colleges are not preparing teachers in those areas			2
" the organization says two - thirds of its recruits stay in academics , like @entity1 , who now plans on teaching as a career			0
she says her experience in the classroom has been incredibly rewarding			0
" when the kid makes the two years of reading growth and they have the biggest smile on their face because they achieved their goal through their own hard work , " she said , " that feeling that i contributed to that student is the best compliment i can get , because i know that kid is in a better place to succeed in their future			0
