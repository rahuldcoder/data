@entity8 was pushing very close in the end but i was pushing in every lap , except from the ones with the safety car			1
" i enjoyed today and i could feel @entity8 coming and it was quite close with @entity10 too , but we recovered and i am very happy the race ended after 60 laps and not 61 or 62 laps			1
