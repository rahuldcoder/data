-- @entity3 's attorney general and state legislators announced tuesday that they 'd join those investigating a chemical spill that left hundreds of thousands scrambling for safe water , with one senator promising " there will definitely be a change			1
" " this whole series of events is unacceptable , " said senate majority leader @entity10 , who will be leading the state legislative probe , echoing many others around @entity3 and elsewhere since the crisis boiled up last thursday			1
these latest investigations came out the same day that a few thousand more @entity17 were told they could use their tap water again , for the first time in nearly a week			1
still , nearly two - thirds of the nearly 300,000 people initially prohibited from using their taps still are waiting for the all - clear			2
their headaches and heartaches trace to the leak of several thousand gallons of 4 - methylcyclohexane methanol -- a substance used in the coal industry -- from a storage tank belonging to a company called @entity33			1
that chemical made its way into the @entity36 , to a water plant about a mile upstream , then into the water system			1
residents of nine counties -- including the one that is home to @entity43 , @entity3 's capital and most populated city -- were urged last week not to use their tap water to do anything except flush their toilets			1
with its strong odor as the telltale sign , officials warned that they could n't say that the water so many rely on to drink , cook using or wash themselves with was safe			2
authorities worked to flush the foul - smelling chemical from the area water system , all while conducting tests that eventually showed it declining			1
chemical spill shines spotlight on loose regulation but it has been only recently some have been told they can use their water , such as the lifting of the " do not use " order tuesday morning for the @entity67 near @entity43			1
by tuesday evening , about 114,000 people were advised it was safe for them to run their taps again -- with more than 180,000 remaining in limbo			1
and it 's not just individual citizens in their homes who have been affected			2
without safe water , schools and many businesses such as hotels , restaurants and more decided to close			0
gov. @entity81 's office said schools would remain closed in four counties wednesday , leaving about 46,000 students at leisure			0
amid this widespread pain , a number of local , state and federal authorities have announced they 're launching investigations intent on getting to the bottom of what happened and holding people , agencies and companies responsible for the spill and possible issues in the response			1
investigators from the @entity100 and the @entity101 were among the first at the scene			0
by the next day , @entity105 attorney @entity104 announced that his office was also looking into what happened , telling @entity0 that " even a negligent release of this kind could be a criminal violation			0
" also on the federal side , @entity112 investigators went to the scene as did a team from the @entity116			0
@entity117 , two @entity105 congressmen -- reps			0
@entity120 and @entity121 , @entity122 from @entity123 and @entity124 respectively -- said in a letter monday they believe the spill may have exposed regulatory gaps in the country 's chemical control laws			1
two new authorities in the state of @entity3 on tuesday announced their own investigations			0
attorney general @entity133 said in a statement that his office plans " to get to the bottom of this and ensure that the public knows the truth " -- including what happened , why and how might it have been prevented			0
" we need to make sure this never happens again , and that responsible parties are held accountable , " @entity133 said of his office 's " unbiased , independent inquiry			0
" and @entity10 , the @entity122 state senator from @entity145 , said the @entity146 on @entity147 -- which he co-chairs -- is also digging into the " unacceptable " ordeal			1
among other things , that legislative body will look into who knew what and when , " and if no one knew , why not			0
" " there will definitely be a change to the way things have been done in the past , " @entity10 said			0
and it 's not just @entity159 who are affected			0
the @entity166 , which serves that @entity168 city and parts of four counties in @entity168 and @entity171 , will temporarily stop taking water from the @entity173 as a precaution , allowing water that might contain traces of the chemical to pass the city , company spokeswoman @entity160 said tuesday			1
two @entity171 water systems -- in @entity176 and @entity177 -- temporarily turned off their valve systems , @entity179 , a spokesman for the @entity180 , told @entity0			2
the move was strictly a precaution since the @entity36 is a tributary to the @entity184 , which feeds into the @entity173			2
the @entity187 utility is sampling the @entity173 water and so far has n't detected anything out of the ordinary , @entity185 said			0
the move will not disrupt customers ' water supplies because the company has a two - day reserve and a groundwater plant that can provide even more treated water , she said			0
opinion : it 's ok , the water 's safe to flush @entity0 's @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 and @entity206 contributed to this report .			2
