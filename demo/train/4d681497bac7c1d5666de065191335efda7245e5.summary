-- the immigration debate in the @entity2 should be guided by what is in the best interests of the @entity2			1
take it from a fifth - generation @entity6 whose maternal ancestors have been in @entity9 since the @entity9 was more commonly referred to as " @entity10			0
" which means that @entity2 need to do everything they can to retain people such as @entity14			1
we have to identify people like this 27 - year - old undocumented immigrant from @entity10 and find ways to allow them to remain in the only country they 've ever known			1
we need more @entity21 because the " @entity26 " -- who arrived in the @entity2 when she was 11 and lives near @entity28 -- understands , better than many @entity2 - born citizens , the responsibility to hold elected officials accountable regardless of what party they 're in			1
@entity14 is one of the most famous @entity26 in the country			1
in 2012 , she appeared with nearly three dozen other undocumented immigrants -- including journalist @entity30 -- on the cover of @entity32			2
in september 2013 , she began an eye - opening adventure when she went to @entity35 to work for rep. @entity36			1
she left after concluding from conversations with other congressional aides that @entity39 would prefer not to solve the immigration problem because they would rather use it a club to bludgeon @entity43			1
she wrote about her experience and observed that @entity35 was driven by " political games -- games that are causing too much pain in our community			1
" she also declared that the immigrant community and the @entity6 people have more power to affect change than " politicians inside the beltway			0
" truth - telling wo n't make you popular			0
and for some in the immigrant advocacy movement , @entity14 is now persona non grata			1
she is attacked on social media , and -- while she used to be a frequent guest at the @entity63 for policy meetings on immigration -- she has recently been yanked out of line several times while waiting to enter for one event or another			2
demanding results from @entity71 elected officials can cost you friends among left - leaning activists who put their party before their cause			0
" unfortunately , a lot of immigration activists are @entity39 , " @entity14 told me			1
" as soon as anything comes out of their mouths , it 's so biased			0
such honest talk can get you labeled a " @entity43 " by partisans on the left			1
especially if you 're also turning up the heat on @entity39 in @entity88 , directly confronting them and demanding that they pressure the @entity63 to pursue immigration reform			1
and especially if you 're criticizing a @entity71 president for racking up deportations			0
" at this point , i would n't consider myself a @entity94 or a @entity43 , " @entity14 said			1
" immigration has become such a political issue that neither party is doing anything about it			1
the object of the game seems to be for both parties to look busy while doing nothing and then blame the other side for getting nothing done			0
@entity39 want to use the issue to bludgeon @entity43 , but they 're also afraid of being seen as too sympathetic to illegal immigrants			1
it 's an issue both parties wish would go away for another decade			2
@entity14 has been an activist since 2010 when she pushed for the @entity26 , which promised legal status to undocumented young people , and against the @entity113 immigration law , which encouraged racial profiling			1
now she is sick of politics			0
while she still supports a path to citizenship for the undocumented , she first wants an end to the deportations juggernaut that has wreaked havoc on so many families , including her own			2
the deportation issue eventually hit home for @entity14			1
as a @entity26 , she has been granted a two - year work permit under the program , @entity127			2
but while this protects her from being deported , that protection does n't extend to her family			0
in january 2013 , @entity132 agents stormed her mother 's apartment and arrested her mother , @entity136 , and older brother , @entity137			0
@entity14 mobilized her network , and her family was released -- though they still had to appear in court			2
in december 2013 , @entity136 was granted a temporary stay of deportation			0
for a 27 - year - old , @entity14 has had enough experiences to fill several lives			2
yet , despite it all , she knows who she is -- even if the answer does n't please everyone			0
in january 2013 , she was being interviewed by @entity150 anchor and commentator @entity151 about her mother 's arrest			0
at the end of the interview , @entity151 asked her : " que eres ? " ( who are you ? ) he wanted to know if she identified as a @entity159 or @entity6 or what			0
i could tell that @entity151 was hoping she 'd go with " @entity159			0
" i 'm very proud of my culture and heritage , " @entity14 said			2
" but i love this country			0
i think of myself as an @entity6 , a @entity165			0
she 's one of ours			0
now if we can just get her to teach her fellow @entity2 how to be less partisan and hold both parties ' feet to the fire , we might form a more perfect union .			2

@entity173 : we have to find ways to let the undocumented stay in the @entity2
@entity173 espouses @entity14 , who is one of the most famous @entity26
he says @entity35 is driven , unfortunately , by political games on the issue of immigration
@entity173 : neither @entity39 nor @entity43 are doing anything on reform
