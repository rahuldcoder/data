@entity0 , @entity1 -- their journey through the desert ended in the back of a @entity9 @entity8 van			1
sitting inside the chapel of the @entity12 shelter for deportees in @entity0 , @entity1 , @entity14 and @entity15 and wait for another chance to cross illegally into the @entity9 with their children ages 4 , 9 and 11 in tow			1
temperatures in this stretch of desert that straddles the @entity9 - @entity1 border hover around 100 degrees			1
" i know that i 'm putting all three of them at risk , but what else can i do ? " said @entity24 , who says he has lived and worked in the @entity9 without authorization on and off for the past 27 years			1
until recently , he kept his family in @entity1 , but he says he can no longer afford to sustain two households			1
" what 's the motivation ? when one of my kids asks for meat or ( candy ) , i can not just say no , " @entity24 added			0
there was poverty when i left in 1986 and nothing has changed			0
" the deadliest trip in @entity9 ? the hundreds of thousands of immigrants like @entity14 and @entity42 have tried to cross illegally into the @entity9 over the past two years , even as the government steps up investments in manpower and technology to secure the nation 's borders			1
more than 150 end up dead every year			0
thousands more get deported every month , according to @entity49 and @entity51 and @entity52 figures			2
but would - be immigrants keep coming			2
" people are still driven by economic necessity to come to the @entity9 by whatever means they can			0
some come to join family members already here , others because they are hungry , " said @entity57 , a public defender and a co-chair of the @entity60 , @entity61 - based @entity59			1
" but the fact is that very few are prepared for such a hard trip			0
many have to survive days and days in the desert , " she said , " and they can never carry enough water			2
" some make it past the desert and go on to find jobs in the @entity9			2
but on the @entity1 side of the border , deportations from the @entity9 have become so common that shelters and businesses have opened up , catering to people who 've gotten kicked out of the @entity9			1
others come back bruised , robbed by smugglers or worse , says @entity86 , a @entity1 merchant who runs the shelter			1
@entity86 says she opened up the @entity12 shelter after seeing deportees huddle in the back of her shop which is located just a few blocks from the fence that divides her city from @entity0 , @entity61			1
she decided to build a place for them to spend a few days in safety			0
dozens of migrants arrive each day at her shelter for food and a chance to sleep on a soft mattress			2
most of the time , she says , they leave not to go back to their homes , but to try and cross into the @entity9 again			2
" they come here from all over @entity1 , but now there are lots @entity113 looking to leave their countries , " she said			1
the shelter houses more than 50,000 migrants each year			2
they can stay for up to three days , free of charge			0
its three sleeping areas house 145 bunks , but on any given night up to 360 migrants stay there , finding room to sleep on the floor of the dining room or the chapel			0
portraits of saints and other religious icon fill the chapel , where travelers say their prayers before chancing the desert again			2
as the national debate over immigration reform heats up , border security is a top issue on many lawmakers ' agendas			2
but from her point of view at the border , @entity86 says she does n't think any efforts in @entity142 to boost border security will have much of an impact on whether people make the dangerous journey			1
" the migrants are going to continue trying to get to the other side of the border no matter what			2
they will do this regardless of danger or consequence , " @entity86 said			0
" they will do it because they lack economic opportunities in @entity1 and they lack the education and ( job ) skills to get ahead			1
" according to the office of @entity163 , in fiscal year 2013 a total of 414,397 undocumented immigrants were apprehended after crossing the border illegally into the @entity9			1
the previous year , the figure was 356,873			0
@entity61 desert : gateway to dreams or graveyard ? for those who make it across the border , it is n't an easy journey			1
thousands of would - be immigrants have died in the desert of southern @entity61 in the past 10 years , according to the @entity177			1
most of them die after suffering dehydration in the summer or fall to hypothermia in the winter			0
the trek can often last days , as smugglers take them through remote paths in order to avoid detection by the @entity8			0
wild animals roam the area at night and the people the migrants paid to get them safely across often turn on them , robbing them of their money and abusing the women before abandoning them , according to authorities			0
" many fall into the abuses of the smugglers , sexual abuse , " said @entity196 , head of the @entity8 's @entity60 sector			0
" the only thing that matters to them is money , not people			0
" @entity206 said @entity8 agents often spot and rescue immigrants stranded in the desert , which is an important part of the agency 's job			1
however , the agency also focuses on prevention , by educating would - be immigrants of the dangers involved in trying to cross the border illegally			1
they ask foreign diplomats at consulates in the @entity9 to spread the word in their countries about the dangers of illegal border crossings , and they try to get the word out in spanish - language media , @entity206 said			2
even so , the phenomenon of deaths in the desert has become so bad that one group of investigators labeled it a " humanitarian crisis at the border			1
" according to the @entity177 , in 2012 the bodies of 157 migrants were recovered in the desert			1
in 2013 , the remains of 169 people were found there			0
" since 2001 we 've had around 2,200 immigrant deaths , " most of them @entity1 citizens , said @entity240 , the @entity241 medical examiner			1
" when we find only a bone in the desert , a femur ... or an arm , it 's not here for long ... we take photographs and measurements and dna " samples			2
unclaimed bodies and bones are buried or cremated after about a year , he said			2
searching for clues since a majority of the bodies belong to @entity1 citizens , morgue staff are in regular contact with the @entity263 in @entity60			1
it is n't the job @entity266 thought he was signing up for when he joined the @entity1 foreign service			1
but now he 's become so used to handling human remains that he no longer feels the need to wear a surgical mask to protect himself from the stench of death			0
the consulate employee has become a go - to person for @entity9 authorities when it comes to finding clues about the immigrants ' identities			1
@entity266 has earned the trust of @entity9 officials because of his track record over the past 12 years , helping to identify dozens of bodies			1
" ( this one ) has dental work			0
sometimes teeth give us clues as to where they come from , " @entity266 said as he examined cadavers and bones at the @entity241 morgue			1
" @entity113 , particularly @entity293 , often have ornamental work done			0
they put copper stars on their teeth			0
" migrants sometimes sew documents into their underclothes , or conceal strips of paper with the telephone number of a contact in the @entity9 or their country of origin , he says			0
this information can be a solid clue to track down identity			0
after the extensive search at the morgue , the bodies are labeled and stored in a freezer			1
personal effects and identifications are also stored , as any clue could lead to the identification of a cadaver			0
sometimes , there are n't many clues			2
if all that @entity266 and the medical examiner 's office have to go on is a set of dry bones , dna testing is the only viable option			0
the @entity1 @entity263 sometimes pays for the tests when @entity1 citizens are involved			1
for immigrants from other countries , the medical examiner 's office relies on its growing ties with the @entity336 - based @entity335			0
the organization , which started out trying to identify remains of dissidents killed during @entity341 's brutal military dictatorship , now has also collected more than 1,700 dna samples from families in @entity1 , @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 and @entity293 in efforts to help find missing migrants			1
so far , they 've identified 65 bodies			0
" this is never a happy ending			0
... we just try to reduce the time that families have to prolong their pain , " said @entity352 , who directs the organization			0
" what it means is ending the uncertainty of the family not knowing what happened to their relative , the suffering that everyone goes through			0
" journalist @entity366 contributed to this report .			0

despite perils of the desert , many immigrants still risk the journey
deported immigrants pack a shelter in @entity1 , determined to try to cross the border again
with few clues , investigators at an @entity61 morgue *struggle* to identify bodies
