the @entity1 and @entity2 embassies in @entity3 suspended operations and moved staffers out wednesday , and urged their citizens to leave the politically - unstable nation as well			1
the @entity1 @entity9 had already been operating on a skeletal staff since late january			1
the @entity12 embassy also said it would close its doors starting friday due to the security situation			1
the troubled @entity16 nation has been without clear leadership and potentially on the brink of armed conflict since @entity21 rebels seized control of key government facilities , dissolved parliament , and placed the president under house arrest			1
president @entity27 later resigned in protest			2
" the level of instability and ongoing threats in @entity3 remain extremely concerning , " said a @entity29 travel warning issued wednesday			2
the warning said an " ongoing risk of kidnapping " exists , and the @entity1 government is worried about possible terrorist attacks on @entity1 and @entity37 facilities			1
however , there are no plans for a @entity1 government - sponsored evacuation of @entity1 citizens at this time , the @entity29 said			1
" @entity1 government - facilitated evacuations occur only when no safe commercial alternatives exist , " it said			1
the message from the @entity48 was similar			2
the security situation continues to deteriorate , it said , and " we now judge that our @entity9 staff and premises are at increased risk			2
" it too asked @entity2 nationals to leave immediately			2
the @entity56 issued a statement to its citizens in @entity3			0
" given the recent political developments , and for security reasons , the @entity9 invites you to temporarily leave @entity3 , as soon as possible , via commercial flights at your convenience , " the statement said			0
" @entity9 will temporarily be closed as of friday , february 13 , 2015 , until further notice			0
" it was n't immediately clear how the embassy closures will affect the work of @entity1 and its allies work in combating @entity70 groups in the country , but the @entity72 says the @entity1 military remains active in @entity3			1
" they are still capable of conducting counterterrorism operations in @entity3 and frankly ... there 's some counterterrorism training that 's still ongoing ... with @entity3 security forces , " said @entity72 spokesman rear adm. @entity74			0
" i 'd be less than honest if i said that there had n't been some adjustments already made because of the political uncertainty , " he said			0
" we 're just going to have to watch this closely going forward			0
" @entity3 's government has been a key ally in the fight against @entity89 , the @entity3 - based group linked to attacks such as the recent slaughter at @entity12 magazine @entity92			1
" they are a very dangerous group , " said @entity74			0
" they do want to threaten @entity37 interests , including @entity1 interests and we do consider them a threat to the @entity1			1
we 're watching them very closely			0
" late last month , @entity100 , a senior analyst at @entity101 , told @entity4 that unless @entity27 is reinstated , the chances of the country avoiding armed conflict are slim			0
" our forecast is really civil war in @entity3 because we have a lot of nonstate armed groups who are likely to compete over territory and have a lot of competing agendas , " she said			0
the @entity21 -- @entity113 who have long felt marginalized in the majority @entity115 country -- have taken control of @entity118 and the northern provinces of @entity120 and @entity121			0
but there has already been resistance to their attempted takeover of national government institutions from different groups in @entity3 , particularly in the south , where there 's a long - running secessionist movement , and in the oil - rich province of @entity131 to the east of @entity118			0
there are currently no talks with the @entity21 , but there are discussions about whether to talk to them , @entity1 officials said last month .			1
