@entity0 -- with a series of potential disasters hovering over the nation like a demon storm , the most prominent words of a @entity0 - based word cloud would be : government shutdown , continuing resolution , debt limit and @entity11			1
although a potential shutdown and the need to raise the debt limit are different issues , they are interrelated and have one big thing in common : they are both products of a crisis manufactured by @entity0			1
and both are being used for leverage in attempts to undermine @entity11			1
so , what 's the difference between them and why should you care ? government shutdown : again ? seriously ? first up , the shutdown the federal government 's fiscal year starts next week -- october 1			1
and @entity32 ' one key duty laid out in the @entity33 is to pass spending bills that fund the government			2
if it does n't , most of the functions of the government -- from paying the military to funding small business loans to collecting the trash in @entity0 -- could come to a slow - motion halt			1
this time around , the @entity43 , led by conservative @entity44 , has linked this funding process -- known as a continuing resolution -- to defunding president @entity47 's signature health insurance law , the @entity11 or @entity11			1
it passed its bill last friday and sent it to the @entity50			0
this week , the @entity50 is expected to strip out the @entity52 provision and pass its own " clean " version of the bill -- and then the drama begins			2
but more on that in a minute			0
what 's important here is that if @entity32 does n't pass the $ 986 billion continuing resolution , or @entity61 , in the next week , the national parks could close , airport transportation security agents might get furloughed and agents might be unable to process @entity65 checks			1
10 ways a government shutdown would affect your daily life next crisis , the debt limit remember that time when you maxed out your credit card ? that 's what the debt limit is all about			1
the @entity77 is on the verge of maxing out its $ 16.699 trillion credit card			0
a maxed - out credit card does n't mean you can stop spending			2
while you have to pay your credit card bill , you also have to continue to buy groceries and pay the electric bill , so you might have to open up a new credit card			2
that 's similar to what the @entity77 government must do			2
the government ca n't just stop paying on its previous debt or spending money , even though its credit limit is maxed out , because it has too many obligations to meet			1
it has to have access to money to pay for the interest on that debt , as well as pay soldiers ' paychecks , doctors ' @entity101 reimbursements , expenses like bridge repairs , and so on			1
so the president must ask @entity32 to raise the limit of the country 's credit card , or debt limit			2
but many think republicans in @entity32 may also try to link raising the debt limit to defunding @entity11			1
sound familiar ? sometime around the middle of october -- unless @entity32 votes to raise the debt limit -- the @entity77 government will be out of options			1
this past spring it already implemented " extraordinary measures " where accounts were reshuffled to enable the @entity77 to continue paying its bills			0
but this time , once the debt limit is reached , there are no other tricks @entity124 can use			2
it wo n't be able to meet 30 % of its obligations , according to a report by the @entity129			2
although the government wo n't " shut down , " many say the consequences would be much , much worse			1
treasury secretary @entity133 predicted that impacts on the global and local economy would be " catastrophic			0
" while the @entity77 operates at a deficit , the rest of the world purchases @entity77 debt			0
it 's considered one of the safest investments around , because it is believed that the @entity77 will always pay its bills			0
but what if it does n't ? the @entity77 will no longer be considered " the most reliable creditor in the world , " said @entity149 , senior policy analyst at the @entity129			0
in addition to potential financial panic because the most stable investment will no longer be considered safe , individual investors , hedge fund managers , other countries -- those who own @entity77 treasurys -- could start to turn to other countries for investments , and interest rates on @entity156 would start to increase			0
that means the benefits that @entity77 consumers enjoy , including low interest rates on home loans , credit cards and business loans , would begin to erode			0
at home , it would also be devastating			0
that 80 - year - old woman who relies on her @entity65 check to pay her rent might not get paid			0
that means her landlord wo n't get paid			0
the doctor who sees @entity101 patients wo n't get reimbursed , so he might not purchase that new flat - screen tv he was planning on buying next month			0
the government contractor who is owed for providing food at military bases wo n't get paid , and she will have to lay off line cooks			1
obviously , this could be very , very bad			0
that 's why each side thinks the other will blink on @entity11 to avoid such a calamity			2
what happens if the government shuts down so what does @entity11 have to do with any of this ? in short : a lot			1
while the health care law is not directly tied to funding the government -- the @entity61 -- or paying bills already incurred -- the debt ceiling -- it is being used as a powerful bargaining chip			1
a group of @entity44 , led by freshman sen. @entity201 of @entity202 , despises the health care law so much that it is willing to risk government shutdown or default			1
while 41 previous attempts to repeal , defund or stop the law have n't worked , the group hopes efforts to link it to these two pieces of must - pass legislation will			2
that 's why there 's talk of a government shutdown			1
the @entity43 , which is controlled by @entity44 , voted on a measure that would fund the government until december 15 -- but in exchange for keeping the government open , the health care law would be defunded			0
but the @entity223 - controlled @entity50 vows that @entity11 defunding will have no part in efforts to keep the government running and is expected to strip that provision out of its version of the @entity61 sometime this week			1
@entity201 and his supporters are n't backing down			0
and neither is the president			0
" i believe we should stand our ground , and i do n't believe ( @entity235 ) @entity236 or @entity47 should shut down the federal government , " @entity201 said on " @entity232			1
" " @entity43 voted last week to fund the federal government			1
if @entity236 kills that , @entity236 is responsible for shutting down the government			0
" but many within the @entity44 think @entity201 's idea is a terrible one			0
while @entity44 have successfully extracted budget cuts from recent battles over government funding and the debt ceiling , most understand that a political poison pill like this is unlikely to succeed			1
@entity249 control the @entity50 with their 54 - seat majority			0
" we are not about to shut the government down over the fact that we can not -- only controlling one house of @entity32 -- tell the president that we are not going to fund any portion of this , because we ca n't do that , " sen. @entity259 , @entity44 of @entity260 , said on @entity262 's " @entity261			2
" if @entity249 win the battle over government funding and @entity11 stays intact , @entity44 indicated they will make similar demands when the president asks to raise the debt limit			1
but @entity47 has repeated numerous times that he will not negotiate on the debt limit either			0
" we will not negotiate whether or not @entity77 should keep its word and meet its obligations			0
we 're not going to allow anyone to inflict economic pain on millions of our own people just to make an ideological point , " @entity47 said at the @entity272 awards dinner this past weekend			0
and even if @entity201 and his supporters somehow overcame the @entity223 - controlled @entity50 and successfully sent a bill to the president 's desk that defunds @entity11 , would @entity47 really sign a bill that guts his signature legislative achievement ? and so we have the showdown .			2

the federal government is facing a potential government shutdown next week
meanwhile , if debt ceiling is n't raised , the government will soon be unable to pay its debts
many are *confused* about the difference between the two and their link to @entity11
the @entity11 is being used as a bargaining chip in both debates
