@entity1 experts got to inspect the site of a reported chemical attack on civilians near @entity6 's capital monday as the @entity7 accused the @entity6 government of trying to cover up the attack			1
the @entity1 inspectors entered the town of @entity12 and appeared to be examining the area accompanied by doctors , according to videos posted on social media by @entity6 activists			1
the team had a " very productive " day and will continue its work tuesday after examining its findings monday evening , @entity1 spokesman @entity18 said in @entity22			1
government and opposition forces have accused each other of unleashing poison gas last week in the suburban @entity28 area of @entity29			1
@entity6 's opposition said that as many as 1,300 people were killed , prompting new calls for @entity34 powers to intervene in the country 's 2 - year - old civil war			1
in @entity38 , @entity7 secretary of state @entity37 called the use of chemical weapons a " moral obscenity " that could not go unanswered , and he said @entity6 actions are " not the behavior of a government that has nothing to hide			1
" @entity47 's full remarks @entity37 stopped short of directly accusing president @entity49 's government of a massacre			1
but he said , " we know that the @entity6 regime maintains custody of these chemical weapons			2
we know that the @entity6 regime has the capacity to do this with rockets			0
we know that the regime has been determined to clear the opposition from those very places where the attacks took place			0
" meanwhile , he said that @entity6 was " systemically destroying evidence " of last week 's attack by continuing to shell the area and that the danger the team faced monday " only further weakens the regime 's credibility			1
" the @entity71 administration is now weighing how to respond in talks with @entity7 allies and members of @entity75 , he said			0
" nothing today is more serious , and nothing is receiving more serious scrutiny , " @entity37 said			1
monday 's examination took place after unidentified snipers shot multiple times at a vehicle used by the @entity1 team and after an explosion near the site inspectors planned to visit , the @entity1 said			1
there were no reports of injuries			0
@entity1 officials did not say who was behind the shooting or the explosion , which witnesses said may have been caused by a mortar shell			1
the @entity6 government accused " terrorists " of firing on the inspectors , @entity6 state tv reported			1
@entity1 @entity99 ban ki - moon said inspectors visited hospitals , interviewed witnesses , survivors and doctors and collected some samples			1
speaking from @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity99 said he has directed the group to register a " strong complaint " to government and opposition forces to make sure the team 's safety is guaranteed			2
the @entity6 government agreed to grant the inspectors full access on sunday , pledging to cease all hostilities as long as the team was on the ground , the @entity1 said			1
and an umbrella group for the @entity6 opposition , the @entity119 , said rebel forces would ensure the safety of any @entity1 personnel in the area			1
but the government would not let @entity1 inspectors approach the site for days , and the team feared that the chemical evidence may have dissipated			1
attacks could reinforce poison gas ' taboo ' @entity131 analyst @entity130 told @entity133 's the lead that @entity37 's comments " went far out on a limb " and indicate that a @entity7 strike on @entity6 was in the works , with or without @entity139 backing			1
@entity130 , the president of the @entity140 , said military action was needed " to underscore the principle , the norm , the taboo that these weapons ought to have			0
" " no one , @entity6 or anybody else , now and forevermore , should be able to use such weapons , much less biological or nuclear weapons , with impunity , " he said			0
but he said @entity38 should limit its intervention in the conflict , " so we do n't get enmeshed in what i think could become a quagmire			0
" " if we want to help the opposition , the best way to do it is through considerable arming of those elements of the opposition with agendas we can support , " he said			0
but with @entity6 already seen as a proxy war that has been spilling across its neighbors ' borders for months , the prospects for improvement are n't likely to be aided by @entity7 airstrikes , said @entity168 , a senior fellow at the @entity169			2
" this is just going to be one chapter in a very long struggle we have in @entity6 , " @entity168 told @entity133 's @entity170			1
@entity174 , @entity6 's leading ally , has raised sharp objections to the possibility of any outside intervention			2
foreign minister @entity179 said monday that reports of the use of chemical weapons must be " thoroughly and professionally investigated " and submitted to the @entity139			0
at a news conference monday , @entity179 said there 's no proof yet that the @entity6 government was involved in last week 's reported attack			1
and sunday , a @entity189 statement compared the @entity34 allegations against @entity6 to the claims that @entity192 was hoarding weapons of mass destruction before the @entity7 invasion in 2003 -- claims that fell apart once @entity7 troops began searching for them			0
@entity198 , the former head of @entity7 weapons inspection teams in @entity192 , said the @entity1 experts will be looking to collect evidence from witnesses and survivors of last week 's attack , including samples that can be analyzed later			1
" they 'll be looking for remnants of the munitions , which could be sophisticated munitions that a military would have -- or if it turns out , unexpectedly , to be the case that the insurgents had cobbled together some sort of @entity215 capability , maybe they 'll find that , " @entity198 said			0
@entity198 said he expects the @entity7 government has its own sources : " presumably , the @entity219 can listen to people besides the @entity7 , so they may have data which the weapons inspectors may not have , " he told @entity170			2
but while @entity38 's evidence may be solid , @entity1 inspectors " provide credibility across the board			1
" " when they say something , presumably all countries will say			0
' ok , we can accept that , they do n't have a dog in that fight , ' " @entity198 said			0
@entity7 officials have said they have no credible evidence pointing to opposition groups using chemical weapons			0
and the @entity71 administration is expected to declassify the intelligence assessment backing up its assertion that the @entity6 regime was responsible for last week 's attack before any @entity7 military action would take place , a senior administration official said monday			1
that evidence " includes but is not limited to " satellite images of activity at @entity6 military installations identified as including chemical weapons depots , a senior administration official familiar with the intelligence told @entity133			0
and @entity37 said he had argued to @entity6 foreign minister @entity252 last week that if the government had nothing to hide , " then their response should be immediate : immediate transparency , immediate access , not shelling			2
" " failure to permit that , i told him , would tell its own story , " he said			0
opinion : how @entity263 used chemical weapons to poison debate on @entity6 @entity263 : it was n't us the @entity269 has sent four warships armed with cruise missiles to the region , and @entity71 will be presented with final options regarding actions against @entity6 in the next few days , a senior administration official said monday			2
but as @entity7 muscle plows the waters of the eastern @entity277 , @entity49 on monday repeated his government 's denial that his army had anything to do with the use of poison gas			1
" the area of the claimed attack is in contiguity with the @entity6 army positions , so how is it possible that any country would use chemical weapons in an area where its own forces are located ? " he asked in an interview with @entity174 newspaper @entity285			2
@entity263 accused the @entity7 , @entity295 and @entity296 of exploiting the incident by trying to verify rebel allegations instead of verifying facts			0
the use of a large amount of chemical weapons would cross a " red line " and threaten @entity7 interests in the region , @entity71 announced last year			0
@entity168 , who has had extensive contacts with @entity49 , said the @entity6 leader may have watched as @entity38 reacted cautiously to previous reports of chemical warfare and gambled incorrectly that last week 's attack would draw a similar response			2
" i think he thought that he could push the envelope again and that he could actually show his own people that no one is going to come to their rescue , " @entity168 said			0
missile strikes on @entity6 likely response to chemical attack opposition accusations opposition members say rockets with chemical payloads were among the ordnance government troops unleashed at the rebel stronghold of @entity29 early wednesday			2
more than 1,300 people died , most of them by gas , according to opposition spokesman @entity327			2
the opposition backed up the allegations with gruesome video of rows of dead bodies , including women and children			0
they had no visible wounds , and some appeared to be bloated			0
the aid agency @entity337 said three hospitals it supports in @entity6 's @entity28 governorate reported having received about 3,600 patients displaying neurotoxic symptoms on wednesday morning			2
but according to @entity6 state - run television 's depiction of events , government forces came into contact with a gas attack on saturday in @entity349 , on the edge of @entity28			1
several of the soldiers were " suffocating " from exposure to gases as they entered the city , according to state tv			0
" it is believed that the terrorists have used chemical weapons in the area , " @entity6 tv reported , citing an anonymous source			2
the government uses the term " terrorists " to describe rebel forces			0
broadcast video showed a room containing gas masks , gas canisters and other paraphernalia that could be used in a gas attack			1
the army said it uncovered the cache in a storage facility in the area			0
@entity133 could not independently confirm the authenticity of video shown by the government or rebels			0
intervening in the @entity131 turmoil : mission impossible ?			0
