an @entity9 war veteran takes one of the four medications he is prescribed for post-traumatic stress disorder			1
three of five members of the military worry that it would have at least some impact , according to the small online survey conducted for the @entity17			1
about half said they thought other people would think less of them if they sought help for mental health problems			1
the report was released a day before a scheduled announcement by defense secretary @entity24 aimed at encouraging more service members to seek help for post-combat stress			2
@entity29 officials said troops who file for security clearances will no longer have to answer a question on the standard application about whether they have been treated for combat - related mental health issues			1
currently , if service members say they have received treatment , they must answer the question in an in - depth interview with a security agent			0
dr. @entity41 , president of the @entity17 , called the figures in the survey " alarming " and urged @entity44 to devote more money to treating mental health problems arising from service in combat zones			1
one in four of the troops surveyed said he or she knew " nothing at all about effective mental health treatments for issues that may arise from their service in a war zone , " @entity41 said			1

" a clear majority of troops rated their own mental health as good or excellent , but many reported regularly experiencing common symptoms of mental illness , including difficulty sleeping at least twice a week and a lack of interest in daily activities at least twice a week			1
the findings came on the heels of a much larger study by the @entity95 , which found that nearly one in five service members returning from @entity98 or @entity9 had symptoms of post-traumatic stress disorder or major depression , but only about half of them sought treatment			1
that study , " @entity105 , " also said troops feared that seeking help could harm their careers			1
the @entity17 study , the @entity110 , polled troops ' spouses as well as service personnel			2
one spouse , @entity114 , said she experienced migraines and numbness in her face after being left alone with two young children when her husband deployed to @entity9			2
she saw doctors even though , she said , " i had a feeling there was n't a neurological problem			0
" she began to talk with other military spouses about her problems , she said , and was surprised to find that not only were others experiencing stress , some had the same symptoms			0
" i was really surprised to find out many of them were going through the same things i was going through			0
nobody was really admitting it was more than we could handle , " she said			0
the survey of 78 members of the military and 113 spouses was conducted online by @entity141 on march 5 - 18			2
