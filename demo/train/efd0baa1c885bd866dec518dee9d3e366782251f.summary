-- it 's been almost six months since the january 12 earthquake that devastated my beloved @entity3			1
speaking for myself -- not for my organization @entity5 -- i will say it : speed is of the essence			2
i feel that progress is being made at the speed of a turtle			1
with the amount of money that has been raised to help our country , i was expecting to see construction projects			2
i was expecting to see thousands of heavy tractors and loaders lifting up rubble			2
i was expecting to see people relocated from tents and starting to get into temporary housing			2
and yet , during my last visit , just a few weeks ago , i saw very few , or none , of these			1
we need to work together -- no one organization or government can succeed without the help and cooperation of others			0
we need to work together for the people there who so badly need our help			1
the country needs to grow in all areas , from agriculture to health care			0
many people have been working very hard with the recovery efforts since that terrible day			1
many of us were there the day after the quake , and we 've gone back many times since , to deliver much - needed supplies and plan ways to rebuild -- and really just to try to help the people			0
unless you 've been there yourself , you ca n't imagine the terrible conditions that still exist for so many			0
impact your world : how you can help @entity3 at last count , about 1.6 million @entity3 are still living in the tent camps , without enough food , or a sufficient supply of water , and certainly without any feeling of safety or security			1
all of these refugees are dependent on donations and have no means to support or sustain themselves			0
and this does n't even include the countless people who have been reluctant to leave their land and their destroyed homes , so they are living with very little shelter on their property , in tents they 've fashioned from whatever materials they could find			1
the unemployment rate of the country is tragic -- it 's between 70 and 80 percent			1
at @entity5 , my wife , @entity76 , and i and the staff have been doing what we can			0
we recently met with @entity80 , @entity3 's special envoy to the @entity81 , who is charged by president @entity82 with facilitating the international community 's efforts to make sure there 's effective aid management and delivery through the offices of @entity89 , the @entity81 's special envoy to @entity3			1
so we brought @entity80 to a property where we are working to show him what we 're doing			1
we showed him how we 've been serving water			0
we reviewed with him our plans for @entity94 , the sustainable kitchen project we are funding , which will provide hot meals for children in schools and orphanages , and which will also provide vocational training for its workers , who will be able to sell some of the food they cook			0
then we showed him the most important project we 're working on : the temporary housing that we want to create that would become permanent homes			2
we 're proposing a city called @entity110			0
we could then start to relocate families who do n't have homes into this new place			0
we want to work with the government to rebuild , and we want to help get families into new homes			0
we suggest starting with a model ; the goal for @entity110 is to eventually build 1,000 homes , which translates to housing for 5,000 people			0
we are working with the government on agreeing to a site in the area of @entity125 for building our first hundred units			2
if the government works with us in identifying people to relocate , @entity127 would start with that piece of land , which has a great agricultural component to it			0
people will be able not only to live in the housing we 're planning to build , but also to plant on that land , grow on that land , then sell their crops from stands on the streets or to commercial markets			0
in this way , we wo n't just be giving these families shelter , we 'll be giving them a way to sustain themselves , either by growing their own food or -- ultimately , this is our wish -- growing enough so that they 'd be able to sell some of the produce and have an income			0
we need to bring business back to @entity3 , we need to focus on jobs -- and , of course , education			1
as we reach the six - month mark , let 's make a renewed commitment to cooperate , collaborate , do whatever it takes to make sure the next six months are eventful in terms of real progress			1
let 's do what we have to do to see things start to move more quickly			2
no more turtle speed ; let 's try to pick up the pace of @entity3 's rebirth			1
