@entity0 -- @entity2 joked at the start of a foreign policy speech last year that " it 's nice to actually finally get out of my fiscal cocoon and talk about these issues			1
" the @entity9 chairman , a notorious numbers guy consumed by fiscal policy , then perched himself firmly in that cocoon by explaining to the conservative @entity12 that good foreign policy depends on a strong economy			1
" if we fail to put our budget on a sustainable path , then we are choosing decline as a world power , " @entity2 said in repeating his personal mantra that fixing the nation 's chronic debt - deficit problem underpins other major issues and challenges			1
@entity2 a big @entity26 trend the seven - term @entity28 congressman chosen to be @entity30 's running mate in november is well - known for his fiscal conservatism , part of a political orthodoxy stemming from his background as a devout @entity36 with working - class roots			1
he adheres to similarly conservative stances on other major issues			1
for example , @entity2 opposes abortion , believing life begins at conception			1
he defines legal marriage as between a man and a woman , and voted against ending the military 's " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy that banned openly gay and lesbian service members			2
an avid hunter , he hailed a 2008 @entity52 ruling that struck down a sweeping ban on handguns in @entity0 on foreign policy , the 42 - year - old @entity2 expresses the conservative view that @entity58 's unique founding principle of @entity59 - given equal rights for all -- referred to as @entity58 exceptionalism -- makes it the rightful and necessary country to exert influence and leadership in the world			1
" a world without @entity58 leadership will be a more chaotic place , a place where we have less influence , and a place where our citizens face more dangers and fewer opportunities , " he said in last year 's speech to the @entity12			0
foreign policy shaped by budget battles to no one 's surprise , @entity2 calls for repeal of president @entity84 's health care overhaul , both on fiscal and social grounds			2
he argues the 2010 law that passed with zero @entity28 support removes free - market principles from the health care industry			2
he also opposes how the @entity84 administration requires religious - affiliated hospitals and schools to provide health insurance plans that cover abortion and female contraceptives , arguing that forces @entity96 and others to act against their churches ' teachings			2
@entity101 : @entity30 blew it the rule " disrespects not only the religious community , but it also disrespects the @entity105 , " @entity2 's congressional website says			0
" by treating our rights as revocable privileges from our government , instead of inalienable gifts from our creator , the president has put his personal political philosophies above the principles upon which this nation was founded			0
" @entity117 : @entity30 nailed it on immigration reform , @entity2 follows the @entity28 line of calling for a comprehensive approach -- stronger border security , an effective worker verification system and no shortcuts to citizenship for those already living in @entity58 without legal status			1
he also opposes the @entity128 backed by @entity84 and @entity129 as too narrow because it only addresses a symptom of the overall problem by providing some young immigrants a path to legal status			0
the proposed law would allow some children of illegal immigrants who graduated high school , attended college or successfully completed military service to avoid deportation			0
with the measure blocked by congressional republicans , the @entity84 administration this year took unilateral steps to stop deporting some eligible young immigrants and give them a chance to get two - year work authorization documents			0
@entity2 sets domestic pace for @entity28 " we must first secure the border and stem the flow of illegal immigration , and then work to increase legal immigration through an enforceable guest worker program and by developing a more secure employee verification system , " @entity2 's website says			1
" i believe it would be a serious mistake to pursue piecemeal reforms like the @entity128 without first putting in place these fundamental components of immigration reform			0
the @entity84 campaign has seized on @entity2 's conservative record , portraying him as a right - wing ideologue who would work with @entity30 to roll back social progress			1
choice of @entity2 a gift to both campaigns in particular , @entity84 and @entity129 argue the @entity9 @entity28 budget plan bearing @entity2 's name would slash funding for government programs such as @entity176 early childhood education and transform the @entity179 health care program for senior citizens into what they say would be a voucher system			1
an @entity84 campaign website says legislation @entity2 co-sponsored , if enacted , could result in a ban on in - vitro fertilization as well as any abortion , even if in cases of rape or incest			1
it also says @entity2 voted against the @entity192 that promotes equal pay for women			0
" congressman @entity2 is a right - wing ideologue , and that is reflected in the positions that he 's taken , " @entity84 's senior campaign adviser , @entity195 , told @entity1 on sunday , adding : " he is quite extreme			2
good , good person , you know , genial person , but his views are quite harsh			0
" choice may shift focus to @entity206 republicans rallying to support @entity2 as @entity30 's running mate say his record as @entity9 chairman , with bold initiatives to tackle the debt crisis , showed him to be a leader in comparison to what they call failed or insufficient policies by @entity84 and @entity129			1
the first poll on @entity30 's choice of @entity2 , released monday by @entity220 / @entity219 , showed 39 % of the public felt " excellent or pretty good " about it , while 42 % felt " fair or poor " and 19 % had no opinion			0
the survey was conducted sunday and had a sampling error of 4 %			0
@entity2 jokes spring up on internet by comparison , a poll of the smaller sampling of registered voters four years ago found 46 % thought @entity232 was an " excellent or pretty good " choice by @entity234 , while 37 % called the pick " fair or poor " and 17 % had no opinion			0
monday 's poll also showed that 66 % of respondents said @entity30 's choice of @entity2 would have no effect on whether they would support the @entity28 ticket			2
