@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's time to deal with another scandal involving the @entity5 — one that leads directly into the @entity7			1
there have been several black eyes in recent years for what was once considered one of the nation 's most celebrated law enforcement agencies			1
the organization responsible for protecting the safety of the president and the rest of the first family has done a poor job of protecting its own reputation			0
besides having to shore up lapses in @entity7 security and recovering from the resignation of its former director , @entity24 , the @entity5 now has to contend with more fallout from a story that seemed to be over and done with			1
when it comes to protecting itself , the @entity5 could take lessons from the @entity7			1
there , a cadre of aides , lawyers and spokespeople have become awfully skilled at covering up mistakes , missteps and misbehavior			0
and yet , the truth has a nasty habit of surfacing eventually			0
such as whether a 2½ - year - old scandal that @entity41 were assured was limited to @entity5 personnel might also have included someone affiliated with the @entity7			1
it was on april 14 , 2012 — during the last presidential election — that the news broke that @entity5 agents had brought prostitutes back to their hotel rooms in @entity50 , @entity51			1
the agents were in @entity53 to prepare for a visit by president @entity55 , who was attending a summit on economic development in @entity58			1
if the idea was to encourage infusion of @entity41 dollars into the local economy , we can assume that federal agents paying young women for sex was not what organizers had in mind			2
you would think that one of the top law enforcement agencies in the world would be better at policing the behavior of its own personnel			2
in the end , nearly two dozen @entity5 agents and members of the military were punished or fired			1
but @entity55 administration officials — including @entity7 press secretary @entity81 — tried to contain the damage by insisting that no one from the @entity7 was involved			1
last week , in an astonishingly detailed front page story in the @entity85 , we learned that may not have been true			0
according to the @entity85 , government documents and interviews reveal that senior @entity7 aides — including @entity89 , who was then serving as @entity7 counsel — were given information by the @entity5 at the time suggesting that the scandal extended to a member of the advance team who was in @entity50 at the behest of the @entity7			1
@entity98 , then a 25 - year - old law student at @entity97 , was a volunteer with the @entity7 travel office who helped coordinate drivers on the trip			1
he was paid a per diem , not a salary , and reimbursed for expenses			0
still , according to the story , travel volunteers are often reminded that their conduct reflects on the president and first lady			0
the allegation was that @entity98 's conduct in @entity51 left something to be desired			2
despite the young man 's insistence , through his attorney , that he did n't engage the services of a prostitute or invite anyone to his hotel room , the information that the @entity5 shared with the @entity7 at the time suggested that @entity98 had registered a prostitute as an overnight guest			1
that 's a serious allegation that should have been thoroughly investigated			2
but was it ? the @entity5 shared its findings twice in the weeks after the scandal with top @entity7 officials , including @entity89			1
each time , the @entity7 counsel and other @entity7 aides conducted an interview with @entity98 and concluded that he had done nothing wrong			1
those who support the @entity5 agents insist the @entity7 should have dug deeper			1
in the end , nothing happened to @entity98 , whose father , it turns out , is a prominent and generous donor to the @entity140			0
at least try to look surprised			0
if the different outcomes seem unfair , you 're not alone			0
many in the @entity5 feel the same way , which probably explains how the story got out			1
there are reports of widespread dissension within the ranks of the agency over the @entity50 scandal			2
let 's not forget the politics			2
remember , this was all happening during a presidential election year			0
@entity157 , the lead investigator for the @entity158 who was tasked to look into all this , told @entity161 staffers that he was told to delay the final report of the investigation " until after the 2012 election			2
" @entity157 also said that , during the investigation itself , his superiors told him " to withhold and alter certain information in the report of the investigation because it was potentially embarrassing to the administration			0
" @entity7 spokesman @entity172 insisted , " of course there was no @entity7 interference with an @entity177 ( inspector general ) investigation			1
" the picture seems to be coming into focus			0
what happened in @entity51 showed bad judgment by @entity5 agents			1
if the allegations against @entity98 are true — and we ca n't be sure -- then his judgment was just as poor			0
and yet , despite the hijinks in @entity50 , it seems what happened next in @entity190 , on the part of @entity7 officials , was the real dereliction of duty			1
once again , the cover - up may have been worse than the crime			0
an unnamed administration official disputed that there was a cover - up , telling @entity2 the @entity7 did thoroughly review the matter and found that @entity98 did n't engage in inappropriate conduct			1
meanwhile , the @entity85 said @entity89 — who now practices law in the private sector — refused to talk about the case			0
it 's no wonder why			2
she is being considered to replace @entity206 as attorney general , and she probably did n't want to foul up her chances			0
that sort of thing could happen just by having your name linked to a scandal this unseemly			2
@entity89 has already done that given the ham - handed way she dealt with the allegations against @entity98			0
her name should be taken off the short list to replace @entity206			0
it 's one thing to end your tenure as attorney general under a cloud , as sometimes happens			2
and it 's another to begin it that way			0
finally , 2½ years after his fateful trip to @entity50 , @entity98 is still part of the administration			0
he works as a policy adviser at the @entity232 in you ca n't make this up , folks — the @entity236			0
even if you believe @entity98 did nothing wrong , the optics are bad			0
now that 's what i call a scandal .			1
