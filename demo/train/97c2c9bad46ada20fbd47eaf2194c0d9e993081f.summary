@entity0 -- @entity3 's prince @entity2 made a heartfelt appeal thursday for the world to come together to end the " appalling trade " annihilating threatened wildlife such as elephants and tigers in @entity10 and @entity11			1
his speech at the @entity13 on the @entity14 called for high - level action by world leaders to be matched by action on the ground to stop the demand for illegal products and punish those involved in the trade			1
the conference was the culmination of a week of events aimed at galvanizing efforts to halt the slaughter of endangered animals for their bones , hides or tusks -- much in demand in parts of @entity11			0
in a declaration agreed to at the end of the summit , leaders pledged to strengthen enforcement to protect animals at risk of poaching , to impose tougher sanctions on all those involved in the illegal wildlife trade , and to address related corruption and bribery			1
they also agreed to destroy stockpiles of seized wildlife products -- an issue which has been contentious in the past			1
prince @entity2 in his speech praised the @entity50 , @entity51 and @entity52 for having recently destroyed substantial stockpiles of seized ivory			1
@entity55 , chief conservationist for the @entity56 , welcomed the declaration , saying it " sends a strong message across the globe : wildlife trafficking is a serious crime , on a global scale , and must be tackled at all levels as a matter of urgency			2
" the declaration calls for a global crackdown on wildlife crime and on the corruption and organized criminal activities that feed it			2
" forest elephants decimated the conference was held as new figures from the @entity75 - based @entity56 revealed that a massive 65 % of forest elephants in @entity10 were lost to poaching between 2002 and 2013			1
based on research across 80 sites in five countries , a study shows that forest elephants are being killed for their ivory at " a shocking 9 % per year , " the conservation group said			1
as a result , they occupy only about a quarter of the area they once roamed -- with the forests of the huge @entity89 notably almost empty of elephants			0
researcher @entity91 , a co-author of the study , said that at least 200,000 forest elephants were lost between 2002 and 2013 , " to the tune of at least 60 a day , or one every 20 minutes , day and night			1
" she added , " by the time you eat breakfast , another elephant has been slaughtered to produce trinkets for the ivory market			1
" prince : dire situation in @entity10 @entity2 said he had been approached a little over a year ago by a group of presidents from @entity10 who made an impassioned plea for help			2
" the situation they described was indeed dire , " he said			0
" the scale of the poaching crisis their countries were facing had reached unimaginable heights			0
organized gangs , terrorist groups and militia were slaughtering ever greater numbers of elephants for their ivory and rhinoceros for their horns			2
" now , the forests and savannahs are " frighteningly silent , " he said , and without elephants to aid in seed germination , the long - term ecology of many forests is " fatally disrupted			0
" the problem of poaching is not just in @entity10 , he said , since wildlife in @entity11 , particularly @entity132 , is also being decimated			1
the leaders gathered in @entity0 will sign a declaration that includes new pledges to tackle the demand for and consumption of illegally traded wildlife products , @entity2 said			1
" most recently , demand from @entity11 -- particularly @entity51 -- has fueled the trade , but we also know that the @entity50 and @entity142 are contributing to it , " he said			0
at the same time , he said , recent initiatives taken around the world to destroy seized ivory , curb consumption of shark fin soup and protect snow leopards showed that concerted action could work			2
@entity3 foreign secretary @entity151 said the issue was an unprecedented crisis that demanded a global response			0
" but this is not just an environmental crisis , " he said			0
" this is now a global criminal industry , ranked alongside drugs , arms and people trafficking			0
it drives corruption and insecurity , and undermines efforts to cut poverty and promote sustainable development , particularly in @entity168 countries			0
" @entity50 market for ivory called second biggest with the issue taking center stage , @entity50 president @entity171 signed off this week on a " @entity174 , " which sets out ways to stem the illegal trade			1
its stated priorities are to strengthen enforcement , reduce demand for illegally trafficked wildlife and work more closely with international partners			0
@entity50 @entity184 president @entity183 welcomed the step in a blog post wednesday , but he said the group was still working toward the prohibition of all ivory trade in the country			2
the @entity50 is the second largest ivory marketplace worldwide , after @entity51 , he said , in part because it 's still legal to trade in " antique " ivory more than 100 years old and non-elephant ivory , such as mammoth ivory			2
" traffickers claim that ivory from recently poached elephants is antique , and they dye it to make it look old and forge documents to substantiate their claim			0
or they traffic elephant ivory as ' mammoth ivory ' or some other ivory - bearing species because those are not protected by law , " he wrote			0
it 's almost impossible for members of the public or enforcement officers to tell the old from the new , @entity183 said , which " adds up to a robust legal and illegal trade of ivory " in the @entity50 , particularly in @entity217			1
" it 's just not worth putting elephants at risk in order to preserve a limited trade in antique ivory or ivory imported before certain dates , " he said			1
" people can live without it , and we know that even a modest amount of trade is likely to lead to widespread killing of elephants			0
" @entity1 's @entity233 contributed to this report .			0
