" here comes the sun " indeed , and it was just barely all right			0
two years ago , modern infrastructure came very close to a serious disruption			0
the culprit ? one of the largest solar storms in recorded history			1
plasma exploding from the surface of the sun in a coronal mass ejection barreled through space and crossed through @entity13 's orbital path on july 23 , 2012			1
if the flare had erupted about one week earlier , @entity13 would have been squarely in the line of fire , @entity14 wrote in a study published in the journal @entity19			2
( @entity14 is with the @entity20 at the @entity21 )			0
this is not the first time solar activity has threatened @entity13			1
a massive solar storm in 1859 , dubbed the @entity25 after the @entity27 astronomer who witnessed it , caused the northern lights to appear as far south as @entity30 ; and it caused telegraph lines to spark , setting fire to a number of buildings , according to @entity36 editor dr. @entity35			0
" according to data from the @entity40 ( a solar observatory ) , the solar storm of july 23 , 2012 , was every bit as potent as the @entity25 storms , " he said			1
@entity14 said that had our planet been in the path of the storm , it would not be inconceivable that we would still be " picking up the pieces			0
" as society relies more and more on high technology such as @entity52 , the @entity53 , satellite communications and smart power grids , we also expose ourselves more and more to the dangers of stormy space weather			1
" he added that power outages after the storm could have persisted for many months			0
if the solar storm had hit , much of @entity13 's technology would be rendered inoperable : from radios and gps systems to toilets			1
though human beings would not be physically harmed directly , a study by the @entity66 estimates that damage from a coronal mass ejection of similar magnitude could exceed $ 2 trillion in the @entity71 and pose risks to national security			1
while @entity13 did get lucky in 2012 , humans should not get too comfortable			2
despite the relatively mild conditions on the sun , solar storms are unpredictable			2
according to @entity14 , " incredibly powerful " space weather is possible at any time			0
space weather : fine , with a chance of solar flares @entity84 cameras capture huge solar flares @entity86 : four ways the internet could go down			0

study : a coronal mass ejection crossed @entity13 's orbit on july 23 , 2012
@entity52 , the @entity53 and *electrical* systems all could have been *severely* damaged
@entity96 could have been in the trillions , and national security threatened
intense solar storms are possible at any time , study 's *author* says
