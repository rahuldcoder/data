-- the police chief of @entity2 , @entity3 , offered a stern , succinct message saturday to the man he believes killed three people and critically wounded two others in a spate of seemingly random shootings : " we 're coming for you			1
" chief @entity11 described the shootings at four separate sites -- all of which occurred early friday within two to three miles of each other -- as " vicious and cowardly attacks			1
" a survivor described the suspect as a white man , driving an " older " white pickup truck , according to @entity11			0
police capt. @entity21 told @entity0 that such a truck had been spotted at at least three of the shooting sites , around that time			1
still , @entity11 indicated authorities do not know the identity of the shooter			0
he added , too , that a basic description of a white man driving a white truck " alone probably accounts for 50,000 people in the city of @entity2			1
" with the assailant still at large , city leaders stressed that information from the public will be critical to cracking this case			2
" to know that you ca n't walk down the street at night in your own neighborhood , that 's a terrible thing , " said city councilor @entity37 , who represents the district where the shootings occurred			2
" the only way that this person is going to be brought to justice is we need some leads			0
we need some people to come forward			2
we need some people to tell us what you know , what it is you heard			2
" about 30 representatives from four different law enforcement agencies -- the @entity2 police , @entity57 , the @entity59 and the @entity60 -- are on the case , as part of a newly formed task force called " @entity64			1
" they 'll be working around the clock to solicit leads , gather evidence and conduct interviews , according to @entity11			0
earlier saturday , @entity2 mayor @entity69 told @entity0 that at least 40 cruisers are patrolling the affected area			1
he added that officers are spending the weekend " going , literally , door to door , and asking people if they have seen anything ( and ) what their opinions and observations are			2
" what authorities do know is the first shooting occurred at 1:03 a.m. friday , according to @entity21 of the @entity2 police			1
that victim , 49 - year - old @entity83 , died at a hospital			0
three minutes later , two people were shot nearby -- one of them " pretty close to the ( gunman 's ) vehicle and the other ... a little further away , " the police captain said			1
those two were initially in critical condition but , by saturday evening , were believed to have improved to stable and are expected to survive , according to @entity21			2
then , just before 2 a.m. , a fourth shooting incident -- like the first , a fatal -- occurred			0
the third person killed was found around 8 a.m. next to a funeral home in a more commercial district , though @entity21 said police believe he was shot much earlier			1
in addition to @entity83 , @entity11 identified the other two victims as @entity98 and @entity99			0
" it appears all the victims were out walking or in the yard , " @entity21 said			0
" this ( happened in ) a residential neighborhood , predominantly single - family dwellings , except for the last victim			0
" all the victims were black			2
the rev. @entity107 , a pastor at a city church and president of the @entity111 's @entity2 branch , said the shootings could well prove to be hate crimes given that they happened in a predominantly @entity116 neighborhood			1
" for a white male to come that deep into that area and to start indiscriminately shooting , that lends itself for many to believe that it probably was a hate crime , " @entity107 told @entity0			1
@entity21 , the police captain , said one survivor recalled how " the suspect drives up to him , asks ... for directions and shoots him for no reason			1
" there is no indication the shooter used a racial slur or said anything else that might indicate his motive , according to police			0
@entity11 acknowledged it is a " very logical theory " to assume they were targeted in hate crimes , but said that " we have had no evidence " yet to indicate that			0
" right now , i 'm more worried about three of my citizens being murdered , " the chief said			0
" and if it takes us in a direction of a hate crime , that 's certainly where we 'll go and we 'll prosecute him for that as well			1
" @entity2 's mayor commended city residents for already having " really come together , " intent on helping capture the killer			1
" it should be concerning to all @entity156 , because we are all in this together , " @entity69 said			0
" some of our fellow @entity156 have been pretty violently shot , and some of them are not here today to enjoy the weekend with their families			0
" @entity0 's @entity161 and @entity162 contributed to this report .			0
