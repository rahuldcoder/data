-- @entity2 's military is pushing to black out a national news station , calling its citing of a man tying government agents to the attempted assassination of his brother -- a prominent tv news anchor -- " false , malicious and irresponsible reporting			1
" already wednesday night , multiple people said @entity11 was suddenly unavailable in large swaths of @entity13 , parts of @entity15 and in military barracks in both cities			2
on its website , @entity11 -- a @entity0 affiliate -- reported similar blackouts in @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 as well			2
and that could be just the beginning			0
the director general of @entity26 , @entity2 's powerful intelligence agency , formally complained to the nation 's military about @entity11 's coverage after an attack on one of its anchors , @entity31			1
the defense ministry then asked the @entity34 to act against @entity11 , including possibly suspending and ultimately canceling its license to broadcast			1
@entity31 was shot three times saturday in @entity37 by gunmen in a car and on two motorcycles near @entity37 's airport , his network reported			1
he is now recovering after undergoing what his doctor described as a successful operation			0
the government condemned this attack while also sharply criticizing @entity11 ' subsequent reporting of the account of @entity31 's brother @entity50 , who is a journalist himself			1
@entity51 said his brother believed @entity26 and specifically its leader , lt. gen. @entity53 , had plans to assassinate him			0
the defense ministry 's complaint -- as cited by the @entity57 -- accuses @entity11 of waging " a vicious campaign ... wherein false accusations were made against a state institution tasked to work for the defense , sovereignty and integrity of @entity2			1
" this telecast tried to tarnish state agency 's image by " falsely linking it with ... terrorist outfits / activities , " the complaint said			0
" ( this ) false , malicious and irresponsible reporting is a continuation of the policy of @entity75 for maligning the state institutions , " added the complaint			0
@entity11 has strongly defended itself against these allegations , in addition to citing other journalists and ordinary @entity2 who likewise have rallied to its side			1
@entity82 , the head of @entity85 desk , said the interview with @entity31 's brother " does not constitute an offense " and noted that @entity2 authorities " are perfectly free to address the suspicions against them			1
his group ranks @entity2 158th out of 180 countries on its latest @entity93			0
and @entity94 , the @entity95 program coordinator for the @entity96 , urged the @entity34 not to act against @entity11 based on what he called " a spurious complaint			0
" " we call on @entity2 's security services to recognize the critical role of the media and exercise tolerance and maturity , " @entity94 said in a statement			1
" the @entity26 is free to rebut allegations in the media but should not try to censor coverage			0
" in an earlier statement , @entity94 had called the targeting of @entity31 " an indicator that the government of prime minister @entity113 has not been able to reverse the country 's appalling record of violence against journalists , despite pledges to do so			2
" a former newspaper reporter and editor , @entity31 writes columns and hosts a political talk show on @entity11			2
his guests have included members of @entity2 's ruling government and the opposition			1
@entity31 is also writing a book on @entity128 , the @entity129 leader whose escape from the @entity132 mountains of @entity133 he extensively reported on			0
two @entity2 governments -- once in 2007 and again in 2008 -- banned him from appearing on @entity2 television			0
journalists @entity137 in @entity15 , @entity2 , and @entity138 in @entity13 contributed to this report .			2

@entity11 anchor @entity31 was wounded last saturday by gunmen in @entity37
his brother told @entity11 that @entity2 's *spy* agency may have targeted @entity31
the military asks for @entity11 to possibly lose its license over this " malicious " report
@entity11 , news media advocates strongly counter this claim
