@entity0 -- a relieved @entity2 headed back to the campaign trail wednesday after sweeping crucial primaries in @entity5 and his childhood home of @entity7 to revitalize his campaign for the @entity10 presidential nomination			1
@entity2 needed to win both states , but especially @entity7 -- where he grew up when his father was governor -- to assert his ability to overcome the conservative challenge from former @entity16 sen. @entity15			1
a @entity15 victory in @entity7 would have raised questions about how strong a candidate @entity2 is within his own party			1
by early wednesday morning , the @entity21 had posted unofficial results from 80 of the total 83 counties			0
they showed @entity2 with 36 % to 33 % for @entity15			1
@entity26 rep. @entity25 had 10 % while former @entity28 speaker @entity27 had 6 % @entity29 , home to @entity0 , was not among the tallies , but numbers posted on its website also showed @entity2 with a sizable lead			0
the state 's 30 delegates will be allocated on a proportional basis , and @entity2 and @entity15 each won three so far , according to the returns			1
however , it was unclear who would win the most @entity7 delegates , which are based on congressional districts			2
@entity2 's victory in @entity5 was expected and more thorough			1
he had 47 % to 27 % for @entity15 , 16 % for @entity44 and 8 % for @entity25 with 88 % of the unofficial returns counted , according to the secretary of state website			0
the result gave @entity2 all of the state 's 29 delegates in the winner - take - all primary			1
in a speech to supporters , @entity2 acknowledged he had to come from behind on his home turf in @entity7			1
" a week ago , it was just a week ago , the pundits and the pollsters , they were ready to count us out , " he said of surveys showing @entity15 leading in @entity7			1
" ... we did n't win by a lot , but we won by enough and that 's all that counts			0
" @entity15 portrayed his @entity7 defeat after leading in the polls as a better - than - expected performance in his main rival 's territory			1
" this was going to be @entity2 's night			2
the question was how big			0
and it was n't very big , " @entity15 said			0
the outcome showed it 's a " two - person race right now " with @entity2 , he added			1
" a month ago , they did n't know who we are , but they do now , " @entity15 said , calling it " an absolutely great night			0
" " the people of @entity7 looked into the hearts of the candidates , and all i have to say is ' i love you back			0
' " @entity15 and @entity44 are vying for the support of conservatives to try to overcome @entity2 's advantage in spending and organization			1
the results tuesday showed that combining the support for @entity15 and the former @entity28 speaker would equal or exceed @entity2 's support , a point certain to heighten the competition in coming weeks as the campaign heads toward @entity95 tuesday on march 6 and beyond			1
in an attempt to capitalize on @entity7 's open primary in which any voter could participate , @entity15 launched automated phone calls monday asking @entity100 to support him " to send a loud message to @entity102 ' @entity2			1
" liberal bloggers also asked @entity100 and independents to vote for @entity15 as a way of damaging @entity2 's chances of winning the nomination			1
speaking to reporters in @entity109 , @entity7 , on tuesday morning -- his first news conference in nearly three weeks -- @entity2 called the tactics by @entity15 and @entity100 " a real effort to kidnap our primary process			1
" he called on republicans to turn out " and say no to the dirty tricks of a desperate campaign			0
" @entity15 defended the calls to @entity100 at a campaign stop tuesday in @entity120 , saying @entity2 used the same tactics earlier when he encouraged @entity122 @entity100 to cross over to support him			1
a majority of voters in @entity122 , which @entity2 won last month , were independents or @entity100 , @entity15 said			2
" and when he goes out and recruits folks who are n't @entity10 , that 's all right , " said @entity15 , who later said of @entity2 : " that 's what bullies do -- when you hit ' em back , they whine			1
" however , it was @entity15 who first complained of the crossover voting tactic in january , telling a @entity136 event that " we want the activists of the party , the people who make up the backbone of the @entity10 , to have a say in who our nominee is as opposed to a bunch of people who do n't even identify themselves as @entity10 picking our nominee			0
" he called for closed primaries with only @entity10 allowed to take part " because it 's the @entity10 nomination , not the independent nomination or the @entity100 nomination			0
" @entity100 who voted tuesday said they did n't need much convincing to support @entity15 in order to weaken @entity2			2
@entity156 said he voted for @entity15 because he 's the weaker candidate			2
" the idea is to help @entity158 get re-elected , " he said			0
" we want @entity2 to go bankrupt in @entity7			2
" @entity2 attributed @entity15 's late rise in the polls to his recent " incendiary comments " about @entity158 , such as questioning the president 's theology and accusing him of snobbery for advocating higher education			1
" we have seen throughout the campaign that if you are willing to say really outrageous things that are accusative and attacking of president @entity158 , that you are going to jump up in the polls , " @entity2 said			0
" you know , i am not willing to light my hair on fire to try and get support			0
i am who i am			0
" the tough talk reflected the high stakes in @entity7			0
@entity2 has led nationwide polls off - and - on over the course of the campaign , but has been unable to increase his support base			2
@entity15 is the latest of @entity2 's rivals to challenge him for frontrunner status by playing on conservatives ' reservations about the former @entity102 governor			1
@entity15 's hat trick earlier this month in @entity136 , @entity187 and @entity188 propelled him to a lead in national polls and a double - digit lead in @entity7 two weeks ago			1
but he had a lackluster performance in last week 's @entity1 / @entity5 @entity10 debate and has fallen into a statistical tie with @entity2 in national polls			1
both candidates spent most of their time following the last debate in @entity7 , making it the key showdown for both their efforts to establish momentum			0
@entity1 chief political analyst @entity202 called @entity15 's focus on social issues in recent weeks " detours he did n't need to take " from the economic message that resonates most with voters in a sluggish economy			2
to @entity209 , @entity1 's senior political analyst , @entity2 's victories strengthened the narrative that his campaign is on an inevitable march to the nomination			2
while noting it was " easy to see how @entity2 can lose this , " @entity209 added that it was " very hard to see how any of his rivals can win it			2
" @entity7 and @entity5 come four days before @entity219 holds its caucuses on saturday and a week before 10 states hold primaries and caucuses worth 437 delegates on @entity224			2
@entity15 adviser @entity225 , who had downplayed expectations for his candidate in @entity7 , noted that the 30 delegates at stake there were proportional , so a second - place finish with a decent delegate haul is just as good as a win			1
@entity225 said @entity15 has already won by forcing @entity2 to spend major campaign resources in a state considered home turf			2
" the @entity2 campaign is spending a fortune they never expected to spend in @entity7 , and every dollar they spend in @entity7 is a dollar they do n't have on @entity224 , " @entity225 said			1
for @entity44 , it 's all about @entity224 and @entity241 , which he represented in @entity242 for more than two decades			0
" i want to focus on winning in @entity241			0
i think it is essential to us to do that , and we are going to do everything we can between now and next tuesday to win here at home , " @entity44 said last weekend while campaigning in the state			0
however , @entity44 's hopes of building a strong support base in the @entity252 after his lone victory in @entity254 appears in trouble			0
@entity15 holds a big lead in polls in @entity258 , another @entity224 state			0
@entity25 , the libertarian champion making his third bid for the @entity28 , campaigned briefly in @entity7 to try to win some delegates , but was mostly looking ahead to @entity219 and @entity224 caucuses to try to increase his delegate count			0
" we 'll continue to work in the caucus states " where investments of time and resources pay off in delegates , @entity25 said			0
@entity1 's @entity269 , @entity270 and @entity271 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 grew up in @entity7 , so a win there was crucial
his victory in @entity5 was expected and more thorough
despite his loss in @entity7 , @entity15 says he performed better than expected
the outcome shows it 's a " two - person race right now , " @entity15 says
