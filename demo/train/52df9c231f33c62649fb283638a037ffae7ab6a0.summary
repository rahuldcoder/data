@entity0 -- @entity3 and @entity4 troops in @entity5 could someday be awarded medals for restraint that prevents civilian casualties in combat			1
the possibility is under consideration by the staff of gen. @entity13 , the commander in @entity5 , according to lt. col. @entity14 , @entity13 's spokesman			1
the idea of rewarding battlefield restraint was proposed by @entity18 maj. gen. @entity17 , who is in charge of the international forces in southern @entity5			2
@entity14 said the idea is still in its " conceptual stage			0
" " although no decisions have been made on the award itself , the idea is consistent with our strategic approach , " @entity14 said			0
" our young men and women display remarkable courage every day , including situations where they refrain from using lethal force , even at risk to themselves , in order to prevent possible harm to civilians			0
in some situations our forces face in @entity5 , that restraint is an act of discipline and courage not much different than those combat actions that merit awards for valor			1
" @entity14 said troops would still have the right of self defense			0
" let me be clear			0
we absolutely support the right of our forces to defend themselves			0
valuing restraint in a potentially dangerous situation is not the same thing as denying troops the right to employ lethal force when they determine that it is necessary			2
" @entity13 has placed a priority on reducing civilian casualties as a means of gaining support of the @entity5 people			1
a number of recent high - profile incidents in which civilians have been killed have given the @entity67 a propaganda tool against the coalition , @entity3 officials said			2
@entity13 has instituted other rules to help minimize civilian deaths , including restricting the use of airstrikes in areas where there may be civilians , and limiting nighttime raids by @entity3 forces .			1

medal would honor troops for restraint that prevents civilian casualties in combat
medal under consideration by the commander in @entity5
@entity3 has been *criticized* for airstrikes that killed @entity5 civilians
