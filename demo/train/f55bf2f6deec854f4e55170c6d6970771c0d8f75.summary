adults who were exposed to large amounts of secondhand smoke during childhood have lungs that look different on ct scans from those of people who grew up in a smoke - free environment , a new study suggests			1
the harmful short - term effects of secondhand smoke are well known ; the long - term consequences are n't as clear			1
specifically , their lungs have slightly more , and larger , emphysema - like " holes " than those with less smoke exposure , says @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , of @entity22 , and her colleagues			1
although breathing tests showed that the smoke - exposed lungs were functioning just fine , @entity19 said the changes could signal an increased vulnerability to developing emphysema and other lung problems down the road			1
@entity31 : should smoking around kids be illegal ? emphysema is a progressive lung disease characterized by shortness of breath , coughing , fatigue , and weight loss			0
about 24 million people in the @entity40 have emphysema and / or chronic bronchitis , which together are known as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( @entity43 ) ; however about half of those people do n't realize they have @entity43			1
the lung condition is the fourth - leading cause of death in the @entity40 , and smoking is a major cause of @entity43			1
@entity31 : i 'm a nonsmoker , but i have emphysema due to a rare genetic condition " the interesting part about this is that we do n't know a lot about how the lungs change over time and whether they heal completely after being exposed to tobacco , " says @entity19 , who is scheduled to present her findings on tuesday at the @entity56 's 105th @entity55 in @entity57			2
" we can still see a difference even decades later			0
" the harmful short - term effects of breathing other people 's cigarette smoke are well known , but the long - term consequences are n't as clear			2
to investigate , @entity70 and her team looked at @entity73 of the lungs of 1,781 nonsmoking 45 - to 84 - year - olds taking part in the multi-ethnic study of @entity80 ( @entity79 ) trial			0
@entity31 : 5 celebrities who had -- or are at risk of -- the lung disease @entity43 about half of the study participants said that no one with whom they lived during childhood smoked cigarettes at home , 31 percent lived with one person who smoked at home , and 17 percent lived with two or more smokers			0
@entity19 and her team checked the lung ct scans for large areas where the density was similar to air ( lung tissue is naturally denser than air ) , and also calculated what percentage of their lungs was made up of these " holes			2
" @entity31 : my smoker 's cough turned out to be emphysema " the lungs are supposed to have air in them , but it 's important that the air is interspersed with blood vessels so that we can get the oxygen out of the air , " she says			0
" small holes can expand over time and merge to form larger holes			0
" for people who had n't grown up with smokers , 17 percent of their lung tissue had this air - like density , while " holes " made up 20 percent of the lung area of people who had lived with at least two smokers during childhood			1
the more heavily smoke - exposed study participants also had more relatively large holes in their lungs			1
in comparison , " someone with emphysema would typically have between 30 percent and 60 percent of the lungs classified as air - like ( or emphysema - like ) using the threshold we used for our study , " says @entity19			0
@entity31 : 1 in 3 smokers would kick habit to protect pet @entity19 says she and her colleagues will be following the @entity79 participants over time to see how their lungs change , and whether people with more early smoke exposure are indeed more vulnerable to lung problems later on			2

lungs of adults who had grown up with secondhand smoke had more " holes "
many " holes " -- less dense areas of lung -- are characteristic of emphysema
even though smoke - exposed lungs functioned fine , there 's concern for *future* health
about 24 million people in the @entity40 have emphysema , chronic bronchitis
