-- who to believe about the @entity3 's program of enhanced interrogation -- aka , torture ? on the one hand , the @entity7 's report states that it did n't produce any intelligence that could not have been gained by other means , that it amounted to brutality for the sake of being brutal			1
on the other hand , former vice president @entity13 has asserted that the report is " full of crap , " and that he is personally satisfied that the program was necessary and useful			1
it seems as if an attempt to gain insight into what the state secretly does to those who threaten it is now being recast as a partisan debate			2
and that 's tragic , because while some element of petty politics may indeed be involved -- as identified by former @entity30 sen. @entity29 , no less -- it should n't distract from the national , moral challenge raised by this report			1
the challenge for the @entity33 is how to best strike the balance between freedom and security			1
@entity13 's big government conservatives would argue that liberty sometimes has to be surrendered in order to protect life and limb -- and that this trade - off is a no - brainer when the people being asked to make the sacrifice are n't even @entity33 citizens and are self - evidently a threat to the @entity33			1
in short : who really cares what happens to @entity33 's enemies ? there are two problems with that perspective			1
first , immoral acts are immoral acts regardless of who they are carried out against			0
all people are owed their dignity			0
that principle is there in @entity62 : " so @entity63 created man in his own image , in the image of @entity63 he created him ; male and female he created them			0
" and it 's there in the @entity71 : all men are " created equal " and " endowed by their creator with certain unalienable rights			1
" so if the state does terrible things to foreigners , it is , logically , violating what are held to be the universal rights of all people			1
and make no mistake : the @entity3 violated rights when it practiced its " enhanced interrogations			2
" the report contains examples of a prisoner being forced to play @entity90 roulette , threats to sexually abuse family members , and a detainee dying of suspected hypothermia due to neglect			2
such moral outrages are no less outrageous because they happened to bad people who ca n't vote in a @entity33 election			1
second , faced with the gruesome details of this torture , we are compelled to question the idea that surrendering a little liberty to the state will result in increased security			1
it is true that there have been no more successful terrorist attacks on @entity33 soil			1
but intelligence operations have not noticeably made the world outside @entity33 any safer , because they do not address the political , religious and economic factors driving @entity114			1
in my country of @entity117 , a soldier was virtually decapitated in the street by radicals -- both known , incidentally , to our security services			2
@entity124 and @entity125 are fighting off a caliphate			0
@entity33 diplomatic personnel have been killed in @entity128			1
it may well be true that the horrors could have been greater without the @entity3 's dirty work			2
but , things that did not happen can not be properly assessed			0
how does @entity13 prove such an unknown unknown ? moreover , any state apparatus that operates beyond the law can not truly be regarded as operating in the interests of the law			1
covert operations in the 1970s designed to destabilize proto - communist movements did not produce healthy democracies , but resulted in the creation of authoritarian regimes that , without any regard for constitutional niceties , abused their own people			0
the very fact that so much secret activity is found to operate outside the bounds of congressional oversight and , potentially , the @entity147 itself suggests that it is more anarchic than conservative			0
we can see the consequences of having too much faith in state institutions permitted to use violence in the recent riots over the @entity161 killing in @entity162 , @entity163			0
a tendency towards confrontation and an over-armed police force did not bring order , but instead created the conditions under which the town descended into chaos			0
do not presume , as @entity13 does , that the use or threat of state violence will guarantee civil peace			2
on the contrary , undermining liberty can also result in undermining stability			0
we may find that public interest in this scandal wanes			0
the 2016 elections will neither be determined by candidates ' stances on the @entity184 surveillance controversy , nor , probably , will the fate of a few terrorists trouble primary voters			2
remember that @entity188 did not suffer in the 1988 election for his alleged role in @entity191 -- indicating that voters often tolerate what many regard as an excess of well - intentioned enthusiasm in defending the nation			0
but they ought to feel different			0
the proper functioning of a democratic republic does not exclusively rely upon having a moral leadership			0
it also requires having a moral citizenry that regularly scrutinize the things done in its name .			0

@entity209 : @entity13 says torture report is " crap , " program was necessary , useful
@entity209 : how can @entity33 balance freedom , security ? 2 problems with justifying torture for safety
@entity209 : torture violates universal rights ; where 's proof it stops terror ?
@entity209 : do citizens care about fate of a few terror suspects ? they should . democracy needs morality
