-- i first met @entity2 in 1989 when i was freelancing for the @entity3			1
that job required me to visit dozens of wineries , and i was even obligated to taste wine			2
@entity2 , a fifth - generation @entity7 vintner , understood these hardships			1
as he drove me around his family 's operation in the @entity12 winemaking appellation back then , he kept talking about the search for special vineyards in the mountains of northeastern @entity16			1
he insisted that an old , forgotten region there could produce the next great @entity7 wines			1
since then , @entity2 has gained international fame for two red wines , @entity22 , which costs about $ 100 a bottle , and @entity24 , which costs about $ 1,000 a bottle			1
he makes them in that appellation he was searching for , called @entity28 , a two hour - drive southwest of @entity30			1
i recently decided it was time to for @entity0 to pay a visit			0

my room looked out at the @entity50 vineyard and my cameraman 's room overlooked @entity54 's winery			0
the dinner was all about wine , although i recall that the food also was good			0

in just one extra large cask , the entire 2012 vintage of @entity24 was aging			2
" the real queen , absolutely , " @entity2 said , gently stroking the cask			2
upstairs , we were soon tasting it			0
it 's so delicate , " @entity2 explained , large wine glass in hand			1
delicate but very distinguished , as is the price , about a thousand dollars a bottle			0

" well , that would be a nice help , " he said			0
@entity2 looked to markets abroad 20 years ago , long before the crisis struck at home			2
and he said others in @entity7 need to do the same			2
" i tell my friends to tell his sons , his relatives , that they must get internationalized because the future is so global , everything happens so fast , " @entity2 said			2
@entity2 has built a $ 16 million business in three @entity7 wine regions : @entity12 , where his family started ; @entity28 , where he made his own mark , and more recently in @entity103 , in northwest @entity7 , an old vineyard region that has also gained new fame , working closely with his nephew			1

but that 's the point -- he 's producing the marquee vintages and the wine that 's accessible to regular consumers			0
" you have to make the best product possible because the consumer is very smart , very clever , " he said			0
" so , great quality and then export			0
you have to also sell in your country			0
it 's both things , together			0
" he is n't afraid to take an unusual path			0
he uses mules to plow prime vineyards on hills too steep for tractors			0
and he does n't have a website for the business			0

" i think that this crisis is making young generations , new generations , understand the that the concept is to guarantee a market in the international trade , " he said			0
after all these years , catching up with @entity2 was comforting confirmation that he and i are not aging too badly , although his wines are surely doing better at that .			1
