as 2013 drew to a close , @entity0 had no realistic plans to marry , after being told for years it was illegal in her home state of @entity5			1
she and her partner had once even filled out an official license application , but were politely sent away by a county clerk			0
yet the couple was urged to save the paperwork just in case , with the clerk 's refrain , " you never know			2
" then a dramatic , unexpected ruling from a federal judge last december transformed the lives of @entity18 and @entity19 in an instant			0
the lesbian couple could legally wed , and they wasted no time			0
" we rushed -- like hundreds of other couples -- to the @entity25 with identification in hand to get our license to marry , knowing we would n't be turned away this time , " said @entity18			0
" as we again nervously filled out the paperwork , the same clerk who had previously denied our application caught our eye			0
she beamed a huge smile and said , ' i guess you did n't have to wait so long after all			0
' " now @entity5 's legal , political , and social journey to define the limits of civil marriage -- playing out in surprising and rapidly evolving ways -- will be publicly debated thursday in a federal courtroom			1
there a three - judge appeals panel will hear oral arguments over @entity44 3 , @entity5 's decade - old , voter - approved measure that defines marriage as only between one - man and one - woman			1
it also does not recognize the unions of @entity5 same - sex couples legally married elsewhere			1
an important question what the 10th @entity53 does in the @entity5 case and a similar challenge over @entity58 's ban could be the driving legal force that seems certain to land again at the steps of the @entity61 , perhaps by year 's end			1
the justices could then finally answer one of the most important constitutional questions of our time : do gays and lesbians have the same equal protection or due process right as opposite - sex couples in all 50 states to wed ? but perhaps the high court will wait , allowing the lower courts for now to control the legal conversation			1
" this is a conservative court , conservative ideologically , and conservative in the sense that they like to take baby steps , " said @entity77 , publisher of @entity78			2
" there are times when the court decides to act aggressively over time , then there are other times when the court is more uncertain and wants to move more modestly			2
in the same - sex marriage cases it may not want to force the entire country in one direction or another			2
" that makes what is happening in @entity5 so important			1
round two the high court 's recent precedents set the stage for @entity96 of the debate , and now the @entity101 will become the first federal appeals court to confront the over-arching constitutional questions over gay marriage			1
appeals courts in coming weeks and months will hear similar challenges over current bans in @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , and @entity113			2
a near unbroken string of state and federal court victories nationwide in the past year gives marriage equality supporters unbridled encouragement their ultimate goal will be achieved : eliminating all laws limiting the rights of gays and lesbians to wed. @entity126 district court judge @entity125 struck down @entity5 's ban on same - sex marriage five days before @entity129 , saying the state 's " current laws deny its gay and lesbian citizens their fundamental right to marry and , in so doing , demean the dignity of these same - sex couples for no rational reason			1
accordingly , the court finds that these laws are unconstitutional			2
" the ruling drew national attention partly because @entity5 is viewed as among the more conservative states , and because the justices ruled this past summer on separate issues involving same - sex marriage			1
in june , the nation 's highest court cleared the way for same - sex marriages in @entity149 to resume after it ruled private parties did not have " standing " to defend a voter - approved ballot measure barring gay and lesbian couples from state - sanctioned wedlock			1
more importantly , the court also rejected parts of the @entity157 in its 5 - 4 @entity159 decision , citing equal protection guarantees to conclude same - sex spouses legally married in a state may receive federal benefits such as tax breaks			0
measure of uncertainty citing that high court precedent , @entity125 's ruling was hailed by civil rights groups			1
but it also created a measure of uncertainty			0
because the judge -- an appointee of president @entity175 -- did not immediately stay enforcement of his decision until the subsequent appeals process is exhausted -- as other judges have done -- it prompted same - sex couples to quickly obtain marriage licenses , despite the state 's ongoing legal challenge			1
more than 1,300 such couples like @entity18 and @entity19 were wed before the @entity61 agreed to the state 's request for a stay			0
" it is very unfortunate that so many @entity5 citizens have been put into this legal limbo , " said the state 's attorney general , @entity188			1
his office later admitted it was a confusing situation , and announced that while it would provide marriage certificates to those who properly applied during the 17 - day window between the ruling and the stay , it would not recognize them as valid , at least for the time being			0
@entity5 may seem like an unusual battleground over homosexual rights , but the level of activism and growing public support is no surprise to many in that state			1
a recent @entity212 survey found among large cities , the @entity210 metropolitan area had the nation 's highest rate of same - sex couples raising children , at 26 percent			0
@entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , and @entity221 were not far behind			0
among states , @entity222 led the list , also at 26 percent			0
when it was passed in 2004 , @entity5 's prop 3 had 66 - percent voter support			1
but after @entity125 's ruling , a @entity228 poll found residents there equally divided 48 percent on whether same - sex couples should be allowed to get state - issued marriage licenses			2
controversial politically politically , the issue remains controversial , a reflection nationwide over how it will be resolved : whether the courts , state legislatures , or the voters should decide the future of same - sex marriage			0
@entity18 and @entity19 are among three @entity5 couples who brought the original lawsuit			2
the case could turn on defining the boundaries of marriage , within the context of family and children			0
" this challenge is about real people with long - term loving relationships who believe they are entitled to respect and honor in this state , just like heterosexual couples , " said their @entity210 attorney , @entity248 , who will argue before the appeals court			1
in their legal brief , the committed couples say @entity5 law " communicates to them and to all the world that their relationships are not as real , valuable , or worthy as those of opposite - sex couples ; that they are worthy of no recognition at all ; and that they are not , and never can be , true families			1
" the @entity268 is also leading this legal challenge			0
will of the voters but the state cites the will of the voters -- and a wealth of social science -- to argue " that moms and dads are different , not interchangeable , and that the diversity of having both a mom and a dad is the ideal parenting environment			0
... as between mutually exclusive models of marriage , the man - woman model is simply the one the state and its people believe is best for children			0
" and officials argue in their brief that " by defining marriage as being between one man and one woman , @entity5 does not interfere with adults ' ability to commit to an exclusive , loving relationship with others of the same sex , or to bring children into that relationship			1
" instead , the laws at issue here simply encourage a familial structure that has served society for thousands of years as the ideal setting for raising children			0
nothing in the federal constitution prevents @entity5 's citizens from making that choice			1
" seventeen states and the @entity312 allow same - sex marriage within its borders : @entity149 , @entity315 , @entity316 , @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 , @entity320 , @entity321 , @entity322 , @entity323 , @entity324 , @entity325 , @entity326 , @entity327 , @entity328 , @entity329 , and @entity312			0
just a decade ago , there were none			0
the @entity5 case is @entity333 ( 13 - 4178 )			2
a ruling on that and @entity58 's same - sex marriage ban could come within weeks .			2
