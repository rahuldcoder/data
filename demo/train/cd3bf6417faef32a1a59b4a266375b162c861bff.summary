-- slavery may seem like a quaint notion in a 21st century world , but that distinction is lost on up to 40,000 @entity5 who find themselves toiling for no real wages and ca n't leave the distant work camps where they live			1
a @entity5 government official takes notes as he talks with workers about to be freed			2
@entity5 government officials and human rights activists call it slave labor , a condition they are aggressively trying to eradicate			1
a special government task force established in 1995 says it freed 4,634 workers last year in 133 raids on large farms and businesses that rely on workers driven to take these jobs by hunger and the empty promises of labor recruiters			1
" slavery is the tail end of a lot of abuse of poor people and workers in @entity5 , " said @entity26 , president of the @entity27 , a @entity29 - based policy center			1
" bad treatment reaches over to abusive treatment to treatment that becomes virtual slavery			0
" in @entity5 , it often works this way : a recruiter known as a " gato , " or cat , plumbs the slums and other poor areas of the vast country and gets people to agree to jobs in distant places			1
once separated from home and family , workers are vulnerable to all sorts of abuses , such as being told they owe money for transportation , food , housing and other services			0
" this is known as debt bondage , which also fits official definitions of slavery , " says @entity62 , a lobbying group based in @entity63			0
" a person is in debt bondage when their labor is demanded as the means of repayment for a loan or an advance			2
once in debt they lose all control over their conditions of work and what , if anything they are paid ... often making it impossible to repay and trapping them in a cycle of debt			0
" the @entity92 @entity91 estimated there were between 25,000 and 40,000 @entity5 working under such conditions in 2003 , the latest year for which it offered figures			1
@entity96 , the director of the human rights group @entity97 , says he 's certain there are still more than 25,000 slave laborers in @entity5			1
according to @entity62 , the greatest number of slave laborers is employed in ranching ( 43 percent )			1
that 's followed by deforestation ( 28 percent ) , agriculture ( 24 percent ) , logging ( 4 percent ) and charcoal ( 1 percent )			0
though those figures are from 2003 , @entity96 says they still apply , with cattle ranches and sugar cane plantations among the top employers			0
@entity62 estimates there are 12.3 million people working under such conditions worldwide			1
" forced labor exists in @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 as well as many wealthier countries ( including the @entity120 ) , where vulnerable people are trafficked into forced labor or sexual slavery , " the group says			1
" a similar situation to the use of forced labor on estates in @entity5 can be found in the @entity129 region of both @entity130 and @entity131			1
" but what may set @entity5 apart are the government 's attempts to wipe out the practice			2
one of @entity5 's chief tools is a " @entity137 " that consists of labor inspectors , federal police and attorneys from the federal labor prosecution branch			2
the group often raids workplaces , looking for abuses and laborers held against their will			0
in 2007 , the task force freed 5,999 workers , a record number			1
in 2003 , the agency freed 5,223 laborers			0
since the group 's inception in 1995 , it has freed 33,000 people			0
labor minister @entity156 vowed in a recent interview with the state - run @entity5 news agency that efforts will be stepped up this year			1
" the @entity5 government is to be commended for rescuing more than 4,500 people from the nightmare of slavery during the past year , " @entity161 , director of @entity62 , said in a statement to @entity0			2
" their commitment to step up their efforts in 2009 is even more heartening			0
the vocal and effective leadership we are seeing from @entity5 is rare			2
even @entity117 , like @entity5 a democracy and a @entity174 member , seems content to remain the country with the most slaves in the world			2
" poverty fuels slave labor , experts say but everyone agrees it 's going to take more than police efforts to seriously dent the practice			1
" slave labor is not a disease , " @entity96 said			1
" it 's like a fever			0
fever is a symptom that something is wrong			0
" that something is widespread poverty			0
although the poverty rate dropped recently to its lowest levels in 25 years , nearly one of every four @entity5 still lives in poverty , according to a 2006 survey by the @entity200 's @entity199			2
the @entity202 - based @entity201 , which says it obtains its figures from the @entity204 , estimates the poverty rate could be as high as one of every three @entity5			1
with a population approaching 200 million people , that means at least 49 million @entity5 live under squalid economic conditions			1
and we have impunity , " @entity96 said			0
" we have to fight these three pieces at the same time			0
we have been fighting against impunity and we have been fighting against greed , but we are just starting to fight against poverty			0
" the situation is made worse because of @entity5 's vastness -- about the size of the @entity220			2
" @entity5 is a big , huge country and there are lots of poor people , " said @entity221			2
" the farther you get away from the populated , industrialized areas , you 'll find large populations of people who do whatever they can to make a living			0
" and slave labor seems to be spreading			1
" we are discovering new occurrences of slave labor in regions where we had n't registered slave labor in @entity5 , " the rev. @entity231 of the @entity232 told the independent @entity233 opposition to laws by most accounts , the administration of president @entity241 , who took office in 2003 , has done much to reduce poverty and fight slave labor			1
but @entity5 's agricultural , mining and manufacturing sectors are large and well - developed			2
and they are politically powerful			0
" we have a very , very strong agribusiness sector , " @entity96 said			0
" it is very , very difficult to get other measures to fight against slave labor			1
" for example , he said , a proposed law for the government to confiscate land on which slave labor is used has languished in congress for years			1
" there 's a group of very strong congressmen fighting against it , " said @entity96 , who is also a member @entity5 's @entity96 for the @entity261			2
there are those who object to use of the word " slavery " or the phrase " slave labor , " saying it mischaracterizes the situation			1
" the word has very heavy connotations regarding 19th century slavery , " said @entity275 scholar @entity274 , a former national security adviser to president @entity277 and now a professor of international relations at @entity280 in @entity29			0
" modern - day practices are quite distinct from what we normally thought of as slavery			0
" but @entity274 agrees that no matter what you call it , what is happening in @entity5 and elsewhere is " a phenomenon that is based on a simple intent to exploit individuals			2
" @entity294 , director of the @entity295 at the @entity295 , also believes that calling the practice slavery overstates the case			0
" to use the word ' slave labor ' sometimes does not describe what it is , " @entity294 said from @entity29			1
" it 's more unfair , abusive labor conditions			0
" he points out that @entity5 's sugar cane industry employs 900,000 people but only 4,000 @entity5 were freed last year for being held as slave laborers			1
many businesses , he said , are being smeared by the bad actions of a few			0
" one case of slave labor is one too many , " @entity294 said			1
" but at the same time , some of their considerations are valid			0
claims of abuse tend to be exaggerated and more general than they are			0

more than 12 million people worldwide estimated to be working under forced labor
between 25,000 - 40,000 @entity5 may be slave laborers , @entity92 estimates
@entity5 task force has worked to eradicate slave labor
