-- even as they were rejecting as far - fetched an @entity4 company 's assertion that it may have identified the resting place of @entity6 -- thousands of miles from where investigators have been searching -- experts acknowledged wednesday that they have little choice but to check it out			1
" the investigators are going to be hard - pressed to blow this off , " said @entity12 , a former inspector general for the @entity13			1
" i think , at this point , because of the lack of results where they 've been searching for six weeks , they 're almost stuck			1
they have to go look			1
" the @entity22 - based firm @entity21 has said that electromagnetic fields captured by airborne multispectral images some 118 miles ( 190 kilometers ) off the coast of @entity26 in the @entity27 showed evidence of aluminum , titanium , copper and other elements that could have been part of the @entity33 , which disappeared from radar on march 8 while en route from @entity35 , @entity36 , to @entity37			1
" the company is not declaring this is @entity6 , however it should be investigated , " @entity38 said tuesday in a news release			1
@entity21 managing director @entity42 , citing intellectual property concerns , would not explain how the imaging works			2
nevertheless , the company got its wish on wednesday , when @entity26 sent two navy frigates into the @entity27 to the location cited by @entity21			1
" as soon as they get there , they will search and verify the information , " commodore @entity47 , director of @entity26 navy intelligence , told @entity0 in @entity49			1
the chief coordinator of the @entity55 , retired chief air marshal @entity56 , held out little optimism that any such search would prove fruitful			1
he told @entity59 that the search area in the @entity61 had been set based on pings believed to have emanated from one or both of the plane 's voice and data recorders			1
" the advice from the experts is that 's probably where the aircraft lost power and , somewhere close to that , it probably entered the water			2
" @entity0 aviation expert @entity74 said @entity21 's claims are not supported by experts			1
" my blood is boiling , " he told @entity0 's " @entity79			2
" " i 've talked to the leading experts in satellite imaging capability at @entity82 , and they know of no technology that is capable of doing this			2
i am just horrified that a company would use this event to gain attention like this			2
" he called on company officials to offer " a full explanation " for their assertion , which he said appeared to be based on " magic box " technology			2
sending investigators to the @entity27 would draw away from the limited resources that are focused in the southern @entity61 , @entity74 said			1
but that wo n't stop them from going , he predicted			2
" i think they have to , " he said			2
" it 's a public relations thing now			2
" @entity100 , director of special projects at the @entity102 , also expressed skepticism			2
" it 's so revolutionary , and i do n't know anyone that knows of this kind of technology , " he told @entity0			2
" and i know most of the people in this business			0
" ' we were being ignored ' the company 's director , @entity111 , said he had not wanted to go public , but did so only after his information was disregarded			0
" we 're a large group of scientists , and we were being ignored , and we thought we had a moral obligation to get our findings to the authorities , " he told @entity0 's " @entity79 " on tuesday			0
@entity21 's technology was created to search for nuclear , biological and chemical weaponry under the ocean 's surface or beneath the earth in bunkers , @entity111 said			1
and the company 's news release said its search technology was reliable			1
" in the past , it had been successfully applied to locate submersed structures , ships , munitions and aircraft , " it said			0
" in some instances objects that were buried under layers of silt could not be identified by other means			0
" the company began its search four days after the plane went missing and sent officials initial findings on march 31 , @entity111 said			1
it followed up with a full report on april 15 , which it would not make public			0
" we only send our report to @entity150 authorities as it contains the exact coordinates of what we believe to be the wreckage of an aircraft , " @entity111 said wednesday in an e-mail			0
by going public with their conclusion , if not their data , the company says it hopes it will spur officials to take its claim seriously			0
@entity36 authorities contacted @entity21 on tuesday and were " very interested , very excited " about the findings , @entity111 said			0
@entity163 , the company whose satellite had the last known contact with @entity6 , remains " very confident " in its analysis that the plane ended up in the southern @entity61 , a source close to the @entity6 investigation told @entity0			0
the @entity163 analysis is " based on testable physics and mathematics , " the source said , and has been reviewed by @entity175 , @entity176 and @entity36 authorities as well as an independent satellite company			0
is @entity21 on to something ? relatives hear new details on tuesday , relatives of the 239 passengers and crew heard new details from officials , including audio recordings of conversations between the plane and a control tower that had not been released before but appeared to contain nothing out of the ordinary			0
" @entity36 three seven zero , contact @entity196 120.9 , good night , " says a voice identified by @entity36 officials as that of a radar controller in @entity35			0
" good night @entity36 three seven zero , " answers a male voice believed to be a flight 370 crew member			0
a preliminary report on the plane , submitted last week to the @entity202 , will be released to the public thursday , the @entity36 @entity13 said wednesday			0
" the report will be very basic , i assume -- most initial , preliminary reports are , " said @entity12 , the aviation analyst			1
" just the facts , basic things			0
" but she predicted it will also lay out what is not known , as well as a blueprint for the path ahead and , as such , could prove helpful to family members of those who were aboard			1
plane audio recording played in public for first time to @entity217 families more intense underwater search seven weeks of intense searching have found nothing linked to the plane			1
though some ships will stay on the @entity61 to gather any debris , the international air effort to find the plane is over			1
the likelihood of finding any debris on the ocean 's surface is " very remote indeed , " since it has probably become waterlogged and sunk , @entity56 said			1
so crews will scour a larger area of the ocean floor -- 23,000 square miles ( 60,000 square kilometers ) -- in a process that could take eight months , officials said			1
the next phase will use private contractors and could cost about $ 56 million			0
@entity56 said that could stretch to 12 months if any glitches with equipment or weather were to occur			0
he was confident the aircraft will be found , though perhaps not soon			0
" nothing happens fast underwater , " he said			0
" it could take months and months and months and months			0
" the @entity243 - 21 , which has searched the 121 - square - mile ( 314 - square - kilometer ) area around where pings were thought to have been detected , resumed searching a nearby area of the ocean floor at about 1 a.m. et on wednesday -- its 17th mission , according to a @entity250 source			1
new phase to include private contractors , may cost $ 60 million journalist @entity253 reported from @entity49 ; @entity0 's @entity254 reported from @entity22 , @entity255 ; @entity256 and @entity257 reported from @entity255 ; @entity258 reported from @entity35 ; @entity259 , @entity260 and @entity261 reported and wrote from @entity262 ; and @entity263 contributed from @entity264			0
@entity0 's @entity265 and @entity266 contributed to this report .			0

@entity26 sends two frigates into the @entity27 to investigate
" the investigators are going to be hard - pressed to blow this off , " says aviation analyst
more than *600* *military* members from around the world end their air search
crews will now search a larger area of the ocean floor
