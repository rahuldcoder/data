@entity0 -- for the first time since the terror attack on the @entity5 , the general public is being allowed back onto the site			1
@entity0 mayor @entity11 , members of the city council and some 9/11 victims ' family members welcomed the first visitors to the 9/11 memorial plaza that opened on schedule monday			1
" the opening fulfills a promise we made to the families on the 10 - year anniversary and keep it open for them and the rest of the world forever to reflect on what happened and to honor the 9/11 victims and heroes , " said @entity11 , who is also the @entity15 chairman			1
families of victims were able to visit the memorial sunday during ceremonies honoring those who were killed in the september 11 , 2001 , attacks that brought down the twin towers			1
" we 're so proud of this memorial , " said @entity33 , who lost her husband , @entity34 , in the attacks and was able to visit the memorial , along with other victims ' families sunday			1
" i can go see @entity34			2
" monday 's visitors passed through metal detectors and surveillance cameras as they began making their way to the the two huge , square fountains that mark the footprints of the @entity5 towers			1
the fountains ' water flows into granite reflecting pools at the center of the eight - acre , tree - lined plaza			1
bronze plates surround the fountains and bear the names of the nearly 3,000 people killed in the 2001 attacks , as well as the six who were killed when a terrorist truck bomb exploded in the parking garage beneath the towers in 1993			0
some of the visitors were visibly emotional as they walked into the plaza monday			1
some rubbed their fingers across the etched names of those who died			0
one man took out a paper and stenciled over a name and carefully rolled up the paper to take with him			0
the names forming the perimeter where the @entity73 stood are those who died in the building and the passengers on @entity77 , which was crashed into it , as well as the six dead from the 1993 bombing			0
the @entity81 site includes the names of dead who were in that building and @entity86 , as well as the names of the first responders who were killed , the dead from the crash of @entity91 into the @entity92 , and the dead of @entity94 , which crashed in a field near @entity96 , @entity97			0
@entity98 was there to greet visitors and spoke about seeing her own brother 's name on the memorial			1
" it was difficult ... obviously , if i could have it any other way his name would not be listed			0
" kastimades brother , @entity109 , worked at @entity110 , on the 104th floor of the @entity73			0
his name is listed next to three or four people who worked at the same desk with him , day in and day out			0
by design , the placement of the names was given a lot of thought			0
architect @entity120 said the names are staggered , arranged not alphabetically but by something known as " meaningful adjacency			0
" this way , @entity120 says , each name connects to another and " beyond a physical place , there is a relationship between one name and another			0
" input was shared by families of the victims so friends , family members , co-workers or people who commuted to work together were listed @entity138			0
by doing so , more personal meaning was brought into the arrangement			0
" it gives me comfort that he 's listed with them in peace			1
" she is also at peace with the memorial			1
serving on the @entity15 board she worked tirelessly to get it right , especially for some 1,100 families , like hers , who have still not received loved ones ' remains and consider the memorial to be sacred ground			2
" i feel the souls of the victims here , " @entity98 said , " and i feel like @entity109 is here			0
" the memorial has created an authentic place of loss ; @entity98 says that sets it apart from any other memorial			2
" it 's a wonderful feeling to know that we are with these beautiful souls			2
" while the memorial is sacred to loved ones , it also is very important for the country , said @entity168 , president of the @entity15			2
" i look forward to people coming here from around the world and sharing in this experience , " he said			0
the memorial plaza will be open seven days a week , forever , @entity168 said , though access will be restricted due to all the construction on other @entity5 projects			1
visitors must reserve a timed pass , which is free , through the memorial 's website			1
more than 400,000 people from all 50 states and more than 70 countries have received passes at www.911memorial.org since the timed reservation system launched in july			1
@entity186 said watching construction proceed on @entity5 1 , formerly known as the @entity188 , is part of the experience			1
" the tallest building in the @entity193 is being constructed right in front of them , " he said , pointing at the structure that eventually will rise to 1,776 feet			0
besides marking what happened here , @entity168 said , the site reflects the nation 's commercial response and strength of will			2
" we can build bigger , build higher ; that 's the @entity193 way , and we 're doing it			2
" the memorial 's museum is still under construction and is expected to open september 11 , 2012			1
