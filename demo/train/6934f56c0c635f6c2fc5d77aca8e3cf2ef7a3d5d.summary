-- for 35 years , the @entity1 has been a nonpartisan and independent source of libertarian views on key policy issues in @entity5			1
we stand for limited government , individual liberty and peace			0
no matter who is in the @entity13 or has control of @entity15 , scholars at @entity1 have consistently argued that the federal government should treat every person as an individual , regardless of background and lifestyle choices			2
we have advocated for limiting military engagement in foreign conflicts that have no bearing on the safety of our country			0
and we have opposed legislation that would involve more government control , even when that legislation is supported by some free - market organizations			0
over the years , these beliefs have put us at odds with elected officials on all sides of the political spectrum			0
we have been critical of presidents @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 for what we believe to be overreaching of executive authority			0
we were among the first to question the @entity35 administration 's war in @entity41 , and we aggressively opposed president @entity36 's economic stimulus plan			0
however , we eagerly work with officials when we find areas of agreement , as we did with the @entity34 administration on trade policies and the @entity35 administration on @entity50 reform			0
but , if @entity54 , the ceo of @entity55 , gets his way , the independence that has allowed @entity1 scholars to focus on smart policies rather than electoral politics will come to an end			1
@entity54 , along with current ceo @entity58 , was a co-founder of @entity1 and provided nearly all of the seed capital and early funding that established the institute in 1977			1
@entity54 's interests have taken him on different paths since ; he left @entity1 's board in 1991 and has provided no funding to the institute for many years			1
opinion : @entity54 believes in an independent @entity1 @entity54 has recently increased his funding for more partisan advocacy groups , such as the @entity71			1
his brother , @entity72 , told me in a meeting in november of 2011 that he and @entity54 wanted @entity1 to coordinate more closely with their political organizations in their efforts to defeat president @entity36 in the fall election			1
@entity79 , president of @entity71 , left little doubt as to what their plans are when he spoke with the @entity84 that same month : " from an operational standpoint , we 're going to have a field effort in targeted states that is doing phones , door to door , and integrated with direct mail and social media			0
it is going to look very similar to what party committees would be doing			0
" that 's fine for them , but not for @entity1			2
the court will ultimately decide who is in control at @entity1 : a board of independent directors who have , over 30 years , provided financial and management support to the institute while upholding its libertarian principles , or two individuals who seek to restructure the board with people beholden to their political agendas			1
the @entity54 brothers are shareholders of @entity1 through an unusual but legal arrangement			1
because one of the shareholders passed away , the @entity112 believe they can take control of @entity1			2
indeed , @entity54 's first step when he thought he had gained control of @entity1 's stock was to nominate 12 people to fill board seats of @entity1 directors whose terms of service had expired			1
none of the nominees had supported @entity1 financially or indicated any interest in the institute 's governance			2
three nominees are @entity54 employees , two are lawyers for @entity55 , two had long careers at @entity54 - controlled organizations , one is a third - generation major shareholder in @entity55 and one is a @entity135 political operative			0
however accomplished the nominees may be , they are not appropriate for @entity1 's board if the institute is to preserve its international reputation as a leading vanguard for libertarian principles			2
would transforming @entity1 from a libertarian research center into a policy shop for the @entity112 ' political operations make any sense ? the answer from @entity1 's fiercely independent donors , scholars and stakeholders worldwide has been unequivocal : no. as partisan wrangling threatens to polarize @entity153 to the point of paralysis , there should be at least one organization to which elected leaders and the public can turn for credible , consistent , free - market policy prescriptions			1
any imagined benefits from a takeover of @entity1 will be more than offset by the flight of its greatest assets -- its scholars			0
similarly , any attempt to direct or influence @entity1 initiatives will result in quick devaluation of the @entity1 brand			1
this would be devastating -- not just for @entity1 , but for the libertarian movement that @entity54 conspicuously supports			1
the @entity112 can easily work through their activist grassroots organizations to advance their political goals			0
but the @entity1 can not be just another tool to promote their interests			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			0

@entity1 has been an independent source of libertarian views for 35 years
@entity179 : if @entity54 takes control of @entity1 , he *'ll* turn it into a partisan policy shop
he says any attempt to direct @entity1 initiatives will result in quick devaluation of the @entity1 brand
@entity179 : @entity1 can not be just another tool to promote the politcal agendas of @entity54
