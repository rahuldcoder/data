@entity0 -- president @entity2 called on tuesday for a short - term agreement to put off deep cuts to government spending , including the military , set to take effect next month			1
@entity2 made his pitch in a statement to reporters at the @entity11 , urging @entity12 to pass a measure that would offset some of the imminent automatic spending cuts -- known as sequestration -- that were part of a 2011 debt ceiling deal			1
the president made clear that he still wanted a broader deficit reduction agreement with @entity20 that included spending cuts , entitlement reforms and increased revenue from eliminating some tax breaks			1
however , @entity2 said , with time running out before the sequestration cuts slash government spending and result in job losses and economic slowdown , @entity12 should pass a temporary fix that will allow time for further negotiations on a broader plan			1
" our economy right now is headed in the right direction and it will stay that way as long as there are n't any more self - inflicted wounds coming out of @entity0 , " he said			1
" so let 's keep on chipping away at this problem together , as @entity41 and @entity20 , to give our workers and our businesses the support that they need to thrive in the weeks and months ahead , " he added			0
before @entity2 spoke , @entity11 @entity20 leaders slammed him for failing to produce a budget proposal the day before , which they said is a long - standing deadline to do so under federal law			0
we care : @entity50 wants to give @entity20 a ' makeover , ' change the message in the 2011 debt ceiling deal that ended a showdown over whether to increase the federal government 's borrowing limit to meet its obligations , @entity12 and the @entity11 agreed to include the automatic spending cuts of sequestration as motivation to pass a comprehensive deficit - reduction plan			1
deep partisan divisions prevented such an agreement from happening in 2012 , an election year , leading to the impending sequestration cuts this year			0
the government has already delayed the impact of sequestration for the first two months of 2013			0
on tuesday , @entity2 said he still supported a broader deal and made clear that revenue from tax reform measures previously agreed to by @entity20 -- such as eliminating some loopholes to increase revenue for the government -- should be part of it			2
however , he noted that it was unlikely @entity12 would reach a deficit - reduction deal by march 1 to render the sequestration cuts moot			1
" if they ca n't get a bigger package done by the time the sequester is scheduled to go into effect , then i believe that they should at least pass a smaller package of spending cuts and tax reforms that would delay the economically damaging effects of the sequester for a few more months until @entity12 finds a way to replace these cuts with a smarter solution , " @entity2 said			1
' without questions ' : @entity94 says more revenue needed to fix budget problems earlier , house speaker @entity97 , @entity98 , reacted to news of @entity2 's plan by saying it was the president who " first proposed the sequester and insisted it become law			2
" reiterating the longstanding position of @entity20 in budget negotiations , @entity97 called for replacing the sequester plan with spending cuts and what he called reforms -- a reference to changes in popular entitlement programs such as @entity115 and @entity116			2
a last - second agreement in the previous @entity12 that passed in the first days of 2013 raised tax rates on top income earners as part of a limited deficit - reduction package			0
that measure followed weeks of tough negotiations involving @entity2 and @entity12 in which other steps to increase government revenue , such as eliminating some tax breaks for corporations , were considered but not included in the final deal			2
@entity2 and @entity41 now want such revenue - raising steps to be part of a package that would replace the mandated deficit reduction of the sequester cuts			1
@entity136 @entity20 leader @entity135 of @entity137 expressed his opposition to such a move tuesday , saying " the @entity141 people will not support more tax hikes in place of the meaningful spending reductions both parties already agreed to and the president signed into law			0
" federal spending cuts under sequestration total more than $ 1 trillion over 10 years , half of which would come from the @entity152			2
it 's your fault : how our ' tribes ' help create gridlock in @entity12 military officials have warned that those cuts , on top of steep budget reductions already in the pipeline over the next decade , would be devastating to its operations as well as the civilian economy that depends on defense - related jobs and spending			2
@entity2 's push to avoid the sequester cuts comes a week before he outlines his second - term agenda in the @entity174 address			1
@entity12 , which authorizes federal spending , has failed to pass detailed annual budgets in recent years due to partisan gridlock over spending and debt , as well as electoral politics			0
instead , it has approved a series of extensions of past spending authorizations -- called continuing resolutions -- to keep the government funded			0
during his first term , @entity2 's annual budget proposals prompted immediate opposition from @entity20 -- and democrats at times -- that rendered ineffective the early year exercise of outlining his spending priorities			0
the plan for temporarily extending the sequester deadline follows a similar move by congressional republicans last month on raising the nation 's debt ceiling			0
that deal put off further wrangling on the federal borrowing limit until mid-may			0
some analysts warn that @entity0 's fiscal paralysis harms the nation 's fragile economy and could bring another recession			0
short - term approaches like the recent debt - ceiling measure and now @entity2 's push on the sequester cuts allows more time for negotiations on a possible broader deal that would address all issues at once .			1

new : avoid " self - inflicted wounds " out of @entity0 , president @entity2 says
@entity2 says sequester cuts will hurt the economy
steep spending cuts from a 2011 debt - ceiling deal will impact the government march 1
the cuts were intended to force a broader deficit reduction deal that never happened
