@entity2 @entity0 walks into the @entity3 in @entity2 complaining of abdominal pain			1
but she has a much more pressing concern weighing on her mind			2
" @entity8 -- can you tell me , i guess , as far as like the symptoms ? " she asks the doctor			1
@entity8 is n't spreading across the @entity12 , but anxiety about the virus certainly is			1
the epicenter is @entity2 , where the country 's first diagnosis and the first transmissions of @entity8 were made			1
before this month , dr. @entity19 said he 's never been asked about @entity8			1
now he 's fielding a wave of questions			2
" i say , ' you 're not going to get it from someone who sneezes across the room , or because you 're sharing an airspace , " @entity19 said			0
" it 's going to require more of an intimate contact , and people seem relieved by that fact			0
" 2nd health care worker tests positive for @entity8 at @entity2 hospital false alarms galore but in the sky and on the ground , the fear persists			1
and with the news wednesday that a second health care worker tested positive for the virus at the @entity2 hospital while tending to the now - deceased @entity8 patient @entity41 , those fears are magnifying			1
five people with flu - like symptoms on a flight from @entity45 to @entity46 were examined by workers in hazmat gear upon landing			1
it turns out none had the criteria for @entity8 or had visited @entity53			1
at @entity55 , 40 firefighters responded to a plane from @entity57 when a passenger had flu - like symptoms			1
" it has turned out that there was some miscommunication , " @entity61 capt. @entity60 said			0
" this patient had been to the continent of @entity53 , but not near @entity53			0
as a matter of fact , it was @entity70			0
" and a hoaxter wearing a mask in @entity55 exited a city bus saying , " do n't mess with me , i have @entity8			1
" the bus driver was rushed to a hospital			0
and police begin a manhunt			0
spreading misinformation on top of the false alarms , high - profile voices have spread misinformation about the disease			1
@entity87 gov. @entity86 told the @entity88 that the state 's public health commission told him that " water kills the ebola virus " and that her advice was to " wash your hands			0
" in fact , water alone does not kill @entity8			1
and singer @entity101 suggested to his 13.7 million @entity103 followers that the @entity8 outbreak is intentional			1
" i do n't know ... but i think this @entity8 epidemic is a form of population control , " he tweeted			1
" ( @entity108 ) is getting crazy bruh			0
" according to a @entity112 / @entity111 poll , 65 % of @entity12 are somewhat or very concerned about the possibility of a widespread @entity8 epidemic in the @entity12			1
@entity115 heads to @entity116 despite @entity8 situation eleven beds for the entire country but some worry is understandable			1
of the thousands of hospitals in the @entity12 , only four have biocontainment units and years of preparation in handling highly infectious disease like @entity8			1
but between those four hospitals , there are only about 19 beds in the specialized areas : 10 at @entity129 in @entity130 ; three at @entity131 in @entity132 ; three at @entity133 in @entity134 ; and an estimated three at @entity135 in @entity136			1
even the count of 19 beds may be deceiving , @entity1 's @entity137 said			1
" the center director in @entity130 says his staff could only realistically handle no more than two @entity8 patients at a time , " @entity137 said			1
" that 's because of the danger , the staffing and the waste removal necessary when you 're treating any @entity8 patient			2
" so that essentially means 11 beds for the entire country			2
that , coupled with a slew of complaints from a nursing union , may seem troubling			2
after nurse @entity158 contracted @entity8 while treating an @entity8 patient , @entity157 said there was no protocol in place on how to take care of such patients at @entity165			1
on wednesday , @entity167 state health officials said a second health care worker at the same hospital has tested positive for @entity8			2
reasons to calm down but in the end , it 's extremely difficult to get @entity8 in the @entity12			2
unlike a cold or the flu , @entity8 ca n't be spread until an infected person shows symptoms			1
and transmission requires direct contact with that person 's bodily fluids			0
@entity182 attorney general @entity181 sought a temporary restraining order to block the disposal of incinerated waste from an @entity8 patient 's personal items at a @entity182 landfill			2
but it 's impossible to spread @entity8 through anything that has been burned , infectious waste expert dr. @entity189 said			2
" incineration is going to kill the virus , " he said			0
" that virus is dead			0
now it is not infectious , it has no risk -- zero risk -- to the environment , to people , to anyone			0
" the @entity12 is far better off than the three countries grappling the most with @entity8 -- @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205 -- where thousands of people have died from the virus this year			2
despite fledgling protocols on @entity8 at @entity12 hospitals , medical facilities are better in the @entity12 remember the anthrax scare ? yet this kind of anxiety is n't new to the @entity12			1
just take the anthrax scare from a decade ago			0
" for a little while , people were freaking out about white powder , and that was costly , " risk communications expert @entity214 said			0
" people do n't freak out about white powder anymore			0
they 're used to that risk , and they take it in stride			0
people will take this one in stride , too but it takes a while			0
" opinion : @entity8 highlights public health crisis a run on supplies back in @entity2 , some medical supply stores have seen a spike in sales			1
@entity233 of @entity234 say the big sellers are the three gs : goggles , gloves and isolation gown			0
" typically , we only have purchases from clinicians , " she said			0
" we have everyday people coming in , saying , ' i just want to have them just in case			0
' " at the @entity3 , @entity19 examines @entity0			0
" so , tell me			0
what makes the pain worse ? " " i think when i have something spicy , " she replies			0
it turns out @entity0 does n't have @entity8			2
she 'll be getting tested for a possible gallbladder condition			0
