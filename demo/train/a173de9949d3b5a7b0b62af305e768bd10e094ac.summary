@entity0 , @entity1 -- barely a year after the country celebrated its return to democracy , @entity1 is ensnared in a new political crisis			1
riot police block a street on thursday leading to a court building in @entity10 , @entity1			1
thousands of lawyers planned a four - day march to the country 's capital , @entity0 , on thursday , demanding that the government immediately reinstate judges whom the previous president ousted			1
the protesters plan a sit - in at the parliament building on monday , and say they will continue their demonstrations indefinitely until their demands are met			1
at the same time , the country 's main opposition leader and his supporters have joined in the nationwide protests , but for reasons of their own			1
the government responded by banning political demonstrations in two of the country 's biggest provinces -- @entity33 and @entity34			1
it also detained several hundred activists wednesday			0
the political chaos has forced the government 's attention away from a deadly fundamentalist insurgency in its tribal areas and an economy that 's on the verge of collapse			1
to understand the reasons behind @entity1 's latest political chaos , one needs to keep three central characters in mind : what do the lawyers want ? the lawyers want president @entity52 to live up to a promise to reinstate judges sacked by former president @entity55			1
@entity55 fired about 60 judges when he declared a state of emergency in november 2007			2
the fired judges include 14 of 18 judges who sat on the @entity60 , including chief justice @entity61			2
critics say @entity55 sacked the judges because they were preparing to rule against the legitimacy of his third term in office			1
he had been re-elected president by a parliament stacked with his supporters , they said			0
after sweeping into power in parliamentary elections last year , the ruling @entity70 promised to reinstate the judges within 30 days of taking office			1
the deadline came and went			0
why have the judges not been reinstated ? one reason behind the delay , some experts have surmised , may be that the @entity60 was expected to look into the controversial amnesty granted to former @entity70 leader @entity80 and her husband and current party head , @entity52 , for corruption charges			2
when @entity80 was prime minister , @entity52 was accused many times of corruption , stealing from government coffers and accepting kickbacks			0
@entity1 derisively labeled him " mr. 10 percent			1
" @entity52 said the cases were politically motivated			0
he spent several years in jail on the charges but was never convicted			0
@entity80 herself faced corruption charges in at least five cases , but was not convicted			0
in october 2007 , with his popularity plummeting and under pressure from the @entity97 to hold elections , @entity55 allowed @entity80 to return from exile and participate by granting her and her husband amnesty			0
@entity80 was assassinated during a campaign rally			0
her husband became head of the party and the new president of @entity1			1
why is the opposition protesting ? the country 's second - biggest party , the @entity109 -- @entity110 ( @entity109 ) , is led by opposition leader and former prime minister @entity112			1
last month , the @entity60 ruled that @entity112 can not hold public office , citing a criminal record that dates to the late 1990s			0
the court also stripped @entity112 's brother , @entity116 , from his post as chief minister of @entity33 -- the @entity120 's power center			2
the @entity121 condemned the court 's decision as politically motivated			2
they accuse the court of acting at the behest of @entity52			0
adding to their outrage , @entity52 suspended @entity33 's parliament and imposed executive rule there for two months			1
the @entity52 administration said the executive rule was needed to maintain stability in the province			2
supporters of @entity109 have rallied in large numbers opposing the ruling			0
why did the court bar @entity112 from elected office ? the case against @entity112 dates to the late 1990s , when he was prime minister			0
at the time , @entity55 was military chief			2
and @entity112 feared @entity55 was plotting his ouster			0
when @entity55 was returning home from an overseas trip , @entity112 refused the airliner to land			0
that order eventually led to @entity112 's conviction for hijacking and treason when @entity55 took power in a bloodless coup			2
separately , @entity112 also was convicted of corruption			0
he went into exile instead of prison , but returned to @entity1 to challenge @entity55 's rule in late 2007			1
however , the election commission barred @entity112 from the parliamentary race			0
his brother , @entity116 , was shut out because of financial irregularities , the commission said			0
the @entity60 upheld the commission 's decisions			2
what does the turmoil mean for @entity1 ? the renewed tensions threaten to take the focus away from the government 's attempts to quash an escalating @entity170 insurgency in the country			1
at the same time , @entity1 's economy is in shambles			1
the worsening security situation is part of the reason			0
rising food and oil prices have also contributed to the crisis			0
in november , the @entity180 approved a $ 7.6 billion loan to @entity1 to help the @entity183 country of 170 million people avoid an economic collapse			1
many in @entity1 worry that the latest turmoil could once again force the army on to the streets if it worsens			1
in its 61 - year history , @entity1 has been under army rule more than half the time			1
for now , gen. @entity193 has said he will not interfere in political matters .			2

@entity1 's main opposition will join protests demanding reinstatement of judges
political protests may *divert* attention from efforts against @entity170 insurgency
nation has been under military rule for more than half of its 61 - year history
