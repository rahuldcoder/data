the @entity1 curse looked like it was going to strike @entity3 again			1
but this time he managed to get through it			0
@entity6 survived a scare , too , while @entity8 might have been stung by a bee on an eventful third day at the year 's opening major			1
hampered by knee , hamstring and back injuries in past losses in @entity16 , 14 - time grand slam winner @entity3 felt dizzy and was close to exiting in the second round against @entity20 qualifier @entity18			1
but @entity3 showed his champion 's heart to rally past his 112th - ranked foe 6 - 2 3 - 6 6 - 7 ( 2 ) 6 - 3 7 - 5 in more than four hours			1
when the night match was over @entity3 sunk to the court , reminiscent of a celebration for someone who has just won a grand slam final			1
in an on - court interview , he said cramps were the source of his troubles			2
recent inactivity did n't help , either			0
@entity3 has n't played much tennis the past six months			1
" i felt very tired after the first set , " @entity3 told the crowd			1
" i do n't know what 's going on , " he added			0
" i felt this irritation after the first set			2
" i started to have some cramps around the body , different places , so that says i was not in the perfect shape because it 's not normal after one hour to start to have these types of things			0
but it 's normal , after a tough period of time without having the chance to be on the tour			0
" the last time @entity3 played under the lights on @entity54 , it was indeed in a grand slam final			1
he hurt his back 12 months ago and lost to @entity57 in four sets			0
there did n't appear to be anything amiss with @entity3 after he won the first set in routine fashion against @entity18 on wednesday , but things took a turn for the worse for him in the middle of the second			1
recovering a break for 1 - 2 in the third , @entity3 called for the doctor and was given medication			1
@entity3 's shots lacking depth from the baseline and with no punch on his serve , @entity18 grew in confidence			1
still when @entity3 broke and held for 5 - 3 , order seemed to be restored			1
@entity18 , though , broke back and swept to the tiebreak 7 - 2 with some flashy tennis			1
early in the fourth , a hunched - over @entity3 was spent physically but somehow he broke and closed out the set			1
holding a 16 - 5 record in fifth sets , the numbers favored @entity3 in the decider			1
despite missing three break points earlier in the set , @entity3 capitalized in the 11th game and eventually prevailed			1
but @entity18 walked off court to huge applause			1
if his winners were n't enough , he allowed @entity3 to replay a serve in the last game when a fan shouted out			2
" not a lot of people would do something like this at 6 - 5 after four hours , so just congratulate him for that and because he played a great match , " said @entity3			1
@entity6 close to exiting it was the second round of the @entity1 , so @entity6 should have known there would be some drama			1
a year after the @entity102 saw off @entity103 10 - 8 in the third set in sizzling conditions in @entity16 , she was even closer to exiting wednesday			1
@entity6 needed to save two match points before finally overcoming compatriot @entity107 6 - 1 4 - 6 7 - 5 in similarly steamy -- though it was n't as warm as last year -- daytime conditions			1
@entity6 struck 43 unforced errors in the final two sets but crucially for the five - time grand slam champion , she produced forehand winners on the match points with @entity107 serving at 5 - 4 in the third			1
that game was a missed opportunity for the 150th - ranked qualifier , and @entity107 also led by two breaks in the third at 4 - 1			1
@entity6 , who is attempting to win a first major in seven years outside @entity121 , was left both relieved and annoyed			2
" i did n't feel that i was positive enough , even though i was making a few more errors than i would have liked , " she told reporters			0
" and i was n't making enough first serves			0
" but i was thinking about it too much instead of just like being in the present , saying , ' hey , go up to the line , do what you do , do what you 've done thousands of times			0
" i 'm good at that and i 'll continue to be good at that			0
but some days are just a little off			0
today was one of them			0
" @entity6 's performance might not bode well for the rest of the tournament , but at the same time , it might simply be a blip			2
last year at the @entity1 , @entity142 survived a match point in the third round against @entity145 and then went on to win her second grand slam title			1
" you never know how you 're going to feel until you go out on the court and compete and play , " @entity6 said			2
" no matter how you prepare , what you did , once you get out there , everything starts from scratch			0
" it was a tough day , but i pulled through			0
i guess at this point that 's what matters			0
" certainly gives me a lot of confidence that i did n't play my best tennis and was able to come through			0
" @entity8 drops set @entity8 lost a set and was visited by the trainer , too , although he was n't troubled nearly as much as @entity6 and @entity3			1
he called for the trainer after losing the first set due to an issue with his hand , yet was n't sure what the problem was			2
he did n't discount a bee sting			0
" i do n't know what it was , " @entity8 said			2
" i still do n't know			0
i just wanted to have a chat with the physio just see what we can do			0
" i know there is nothing we could do			0
i knew we could n't tape it up because then it would be even bigger and more weird			0
i just said , ' i hope it does n't get worse or stay like this			0
' actually it went away , but now i feel it again			0
" the record 17 - time grand slam winner recovered and eventually eased past @entity185 @entity184 3 - 6 6 - 3 6 - 2 6 - 2			1
@entity8 only faced one break point and hit 15 aces			2
the @entity189 ' potential quarterfinal foe is @entity190 , and the @entity191 made quick work of @entity194 @entity193 6 - 1 6 - 3 6 - 2			2
@entity195 , meanwhile , extended his winning streak to 10 matches by defeating @entity199 's @entity198 6 - 4 4 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 0			2
the @entity201 's ranking fell outside the top 800 in july following a contentious drug suspension but @entity195 now finds himself in the top 60 after winning a title in @entity204 last week			0
the ranking will climb further with his wins in @entity16			2
" i 'm enjoying playing tennis and having fun on the court , " @entity195 , a former top - 20 player , said			2
" i missed it a lot and that gives me a lot of joy on the court and a lot of motivation			0
" trying to use any chance , any match , any tournament			0
