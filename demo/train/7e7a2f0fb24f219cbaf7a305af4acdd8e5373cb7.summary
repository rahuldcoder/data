-- beginning this week , under - 12s are banned from the first seven rows of economy class on @entity5 flights to @entity6 , @entity7 , @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11			1
in an official press release , @entity5 's ceo @entity12 described the new rollout as a " heavenly package for those who want peace of mind			0
" not to mention peace of ear			0
readers take aim at kids on a plane passengers booked on @entity5 , the long - haul arm of @entity5 , can now opt for the seats for an additional cost of @entity29 ( u.s. $ 11 ) or @entity30 ( u.s. $ 35.50 ) -- the standard fee charged for picking specific seats in economy class and in the " hot seats " section , which provide more leg room			1
the child - free area , called the " @entity38 , " has softer lighting and is sectioned off from the rest of the plane by toilets and bulkheads , the theory being you wo n't be able to hear the kids who are toward the back of the plane			1
still , anyone who 's been within 100 meters of a screaming child will know that their cries wo n't be stifled by a few partition curtains			0
just as cigarette smoke could waft into the non-smoking areas before it was banned , so too will noise , said @entity56 , founder of @entity57 , speaking to @entity59 news when @entity5 's new option was announced last year			2
" if you were just one row away from the smoking section , you still got the smoke , " he said			0
" and you 'll still hear the screams ... if a child has strong lungs			0
" @entity12 was eager to note that kids are n't actually being banned from traveling and that the new offering was about customizing preferences and " fair choice , " pointing out that the flights will be adding three baby bassinets to the other two economy cabin sections			1
@entity5 's competitor , @entity75 , started flying last year year with child - free first class cabins as well as a child - free upper deck economy section on its a380 service			1
@entity5 is @entity81 's largest budget carrier , with hubs in @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity8 and @entity85			0
