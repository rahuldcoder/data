-- an advocate for honoring women on @entity4 currency was thanked for her efforts on @entity6 with dozens of rape threats			1
a female writer who recently spoke out against rape jokes , almost predictably , got the same treatment			2
meanwhile , @entity11 was called to task for not being quick enough to stamp out pages such as " @entity14 in the uterus " and " @entity16			1
" hateful words and actions targeting women and other groups are , of course , nothing new			2
but in our digital age , social media sites must increasingly face the fact that their services have become the new schoolyard or city square , where a majority of friendly discussion and positive interaction comes with an ugly undercurrent of nastiness			1
" expressed hate and abuse is unfortunately part of our society , and it is now also part of our real - time digital culture , " said @entity33 , a new media analyst for @entity35 and author of " what 's the @entity38 ? changing the @entity46			2
" " as we live the digital lifestyle , our expectations are such that any menace should not only be dealt with accordingly , it should be done immediately			2
" the question for sites such as @entity6 , which on tuesday responded to a petition to make reporting abusive behavior easier , is how to police hundreds of millions of people , providing a safe environment for some users while respecting the free speech of others			1
at the heart of the problem are the mechanics of policing			2
the sheer number of users means that flagging misbehavior is like playing a vast , never - ending game of @entity67			2
" @entity6 represents a new medium that the world has n't seen before , " @entity68 said of the site that supports 400 million tweets every day			1
" to protect its users , it must invest in automated and manual safety and reporting mechanisms as it grows			2
" this week , the @entity78 announced that " @entity80 " author @entity79 will be featured on 10 - pound notes			0
the move came after a campaign by @entity84 and others			0
on @entity6 , @entity84 wrote that the response got ugly fast : " i actually ca n't keep up with the screen - capping & reporting -- rape threats thick and fast now , " she wrote now			1
" if anyone wants to report the tweets to @entity6			1
" some of the accounts she cited have since been suspended			0
eventually , one man was arrested sunday in @entity97 , @entity98			1
@entity4 police also are investigating a threat of rape and murder made to @entity103 , a @entity104 member of @entity105 , after she tweeted her support of @entity84			1
but activists complained that @entity6 did n't act quickly enough			1
a @entity110 petition , calling on the site to add a prominent " report abuse " button , had gotten more than 88,000 signatures as of tuesday			0
the effort prompted @entity116 , @entity6 's senior director for @entity118 , to respond tuesday in a blog post titled " we hear you			1
" " we see an incredible amount of activity passing through our systems ... , " she wrote on @entity6 's @entity4 blog			1
" the vast majority of these use cases are positive			0
that said , we are not blind to the reality that there will always be people using @entity6 in ways that are abusive and may harm others			1
" @entity134 noted that three weeks ago the site rolled out a tool for @entity137 that lets users report individual tweets			0
that feature will hit web and other mobile systems soon , she wrote			0
she acknowledged , however , that putting eyeballs on every offensive tweet is difficult , if not impossible			0
" while manually reviewing every tweet is not possible due to @entity6 's global reach and level of activity , we use both automated and manual systems to evaluate reports of users potentially violating our @entity152 , ' @entity134 wrote			1
" these rules explicitly bar direct , specific threats of violence against others and use of our service for unlawful purposes , for which users may be suspended when reported			1
" the movement , and response , are not unlike a similar recent effort on @entity11			2
in may , a coalition of women 's groups called for the site to get tough on pages that appeared to embrace hate speech , particularly violent language , toward women			0
@entity11 responded by rolling out a slate of efforts that , among other things , increased accountability for pages that post content that is " cruel or insensitive			2
" speaking saturday at the @entity180 conference in @entity181 , @entity11 chief operating officer @entity178 acknowledged the difficulties in policing abusive behavior among the site 's more than 1 billion account holders			1
but she said tools to do so continue to improve			0
" we have this really big challenge between free expression , which is really important ... , and creating a safe and protected community , " she said			0
" we take both very seriously			0
" the no. 1 thing people can do is when you find content that 's inappropriate , there 's a report button			0
hit that report button because we can look at and take down inappropriate content as long as we see it , and ( it ) is really an important part of what we 're trying to do			0
" both the @entity6 and @entity11 episodes mark what appears to be a shift in online culture			1
throughout the @entity207 's history , a certain amount of bad behavior has come to be expected , be it intentionally provocative online trolling or earnest hatred spewed more freely because of the ability to do so anonymously			0
but , in 2013 , it 's become nearly impossible to distinguish where " web culture " ends and culture as a whole begins			0
@entity68 , the analyst , noted that as social media become more and more mainstream , bad behavior that would never be accepted on a sidewalk will increasingly be policed , one way or another , online			1
" the idea of ' freedom of tweet ' does not supersede law , " he said			0
" expression aimed at hurting or threatening someone is indeed a threat heard around the world			0

social media sites are *wrestling* with how to police hateful speech
a man in @entity98 was arrested after a *feminist* received rape threats on @entity6
sites have difficulty policing millions of users
but expectations are high as @entity6 , @entity11 have become more mainstream
