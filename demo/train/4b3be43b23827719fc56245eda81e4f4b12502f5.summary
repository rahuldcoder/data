-- diet drugs have had a rough year in 2010			1
in october , the @entity2 ( @entity2 ) nixed not one but two new weight - loss drugs , lorcaserin and @entity6 , because of possible links to cancer ( lorcaserin ) and heart problems ( @entity6 )			1
but this week an @entity2 advisory committee gave the thumbs up to a third drug , @entity14 , meaning there could be a new tool on the horizon for battling obesity			1
( the @entity2 does n't have to approve the drug , but often follows its panels ' advice			1
) and really , doctors could use one			0
previous attempts to find safe diet drugs that work by controlling appetite have met with some success , but most have been doomed by side effects			1
@entity29 , heavily marketed in the 1990s , caused heart valve problems while rimonabant became linked with suicidal thinking and depression , leading an @entity2 advisory committee to recommend against approving it in 2007			1
@entity0 : 10 things to say to someone with depression " that was the drug we were waiting for , " says @entity37 , @entity38 , chief of endocrinology at the @entity40 in @entity41			1
" we thought it would be the next big blockbuster drug for weight loss			1
nor was @entity48 ( sibutramine ) , which @entity50 voluntarily withdrew from the market in october due to an increased risk for heart attack and stroke			0
all of the drugs worked through different neurotransmitters in the brain to suppress appetite			2
( the only drug on the market specifically approved for dieters is orlistat , sold as @entity63 and @entity64 , which prevents the breakdown of fat in the intestines			2
it was the last diet drug approved by the @entity2 in 1999			1
) @entity0 : 36 holiday foods you should n't eat so what 's different about @entity14 ? unlike various predecessors , most of which fell by the wayside because of side effects , @entity14 combines two older medications into one that experts hope will help push off the pounds -- safely			1
" it 's kind of a neat little approach			0
they 've taken two drugs that have been around for a very long time with relatively good safety profiles and put them together , hoping that the combined action might be better at controlling eating , " says @entity84 , phd , associate professor of molecular therapeutics at @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity88			2
" it 's a double whammy			0
" the two drugs are naltrexone , used to treat alcohol and cocaine addiction , and bupropion ( known mainly as @entity101 ) , an antidepressant , which also helps people quit smoking			1
@entity0 : 10 surprising facts about antidepressant together , the compounds affect both appetite or satiety and motivation , or the drive to eat , says @entity112 , @entity38 , a senior scientist with @entity113 in @entity114 , @entity41			0
naltrexone impacts the brain 's opioid receptors , which are involved in feelings of pleasure and reward			2
" one of the reasons we eat cheesecake or something that 's really good is to stimulate the opioid system , " @entity84 explains			0
" @entity127 blocks that to some degree			0
" @entity101 increases brain levels of dopamine , the notorious " feel good " chemical that is also released when cocaine or amphetamines are taken			1
" it gives you a little kick so you feel okay and do n't have to look for food , " says dr. @entity112			0
" it 's very similar to amphetamines , but it 's not so effective , [ which is ] better because if it 's too effective , it makes you more addicted			0
" @entity0 : @entity143 's healthiest mall food " many of the neurotransmitters bupropion increases are involved in satiety -- you 've eaten enough , " adds @entity84			0
" giving bupropion is one way of tricking the brain into thinking you 're full			0
" in one study , the average weight loss for a group taking a higher dose ( 32 mg ) of naltrexone plus bupropion for about a year was 6.1 % while for a lower dose ( 16 mg ) it was 5 %			1
( people taking a placebo had an average weight loss of 1.3 %			1
) however , only half the participants who started the trial actually finished it			0
people taking the drug combo were more likely to report nausea , headache , constipation , dizziness , and vomiting than those taking a placebo			2
and while promising , the drug is still not in the clear in terms of safety			2
the @entity2 committee was divided on @entity14 's safety profile , with members ultimately voting in favor of conducting further studies on whether it might lead to heart attacks , stroke , and increased blood pressure			1
personalized tips for managing diabetes : take this test " obesity is really a crisis , " says @entity188 , @entity38 , an internist with @entity189 in @entity41			2
two - thirds of the @entity143 adult population is either overweight or obese while a growing number of adolescents are climbing into the danger range , many developing type 2 diabetes at younger and younger ages			2
@entity0 : could you have type 2 ? 10 diabetes symptoms right now , there are few effective tools to aid in the effort , though , ultimately , many experts feel the answer to @entity143 's obesity lies not with a drug but , rather , lifestyle changes			1
" the problem is not a pill but the way we live our lives , " @entity188 says			0
" i do n't think any medication [ will work ] without behavior change , " @entity112 agrees			0
" if you do n't change your behavior , nothing will help you			0
