@entity0 , @entity1 -- the state @entity3 here is consumed with an ongoing sexual harassment scandal			1
the embattled governor is so unpopular she decided not to run for a second term			0
and supporters of same - sex marriage were dealt a crushing defeat at the ballot box last week			0
but the biggest challenge in @entity1 this year for president @entity14 and his fellow @entity3 can be boiled down to something simpler : math. everything that could have gone right for @entity14 in 2008 did go right , and yet he still only won @entity1 by just 14,177 votes -- a tiny sliver of the 4.2 million cast statewide			1
thanks to his campaign 's striking ability to expand the @entity3 electorate , @entity14 even managed to win the state while losing independents to @entity26			1
volunteers blitzed college campuses and dominated the early voting game			0
new @entity32 - @entity31 voters were registered in huge numbers			0
@entity14 also performed better among white voters than both @entity35 and @entity36			1
crucially , @entity38 turnout fell off dramatically from 2004			0
@entity14 world read the victory as a promising sign of @entity3 realignment in the @entity43 and rewarded the @entity1 with the @entity44 , which will take place in @entity46 in september			1
today , though , it 's hard to find a @entity48 in the capital of @entity0 who believes the president , saddled with the burdens of governing and a sputtering economy , can stir the enthusiasm of 2008 and repeat his near - flawless @entity1 performance			1
" my heart says he will win here , but my head says it 's going to be awfully tough for him , " said @entity57 , a longtime @entity3 consultant and adviser to former gov. @entity59			1
" this is a tight state for him			0
race is part of it			0
the economy is a big problem			0
four years ago he was new , he was exciting			0
he was hope and change			0
that has worn off now			0
it 's going to be tough for him to catch magic in the bottle again			0
" @entity14 's fading luster has put enormous pressure on his team not only to mobilize the existing @entity3 base but also to find new voters			1
the president 's path to victory becomes even narrower if @entity38 turnout grows from the dismal 31 % showing of 2008 -- a certainty according to political operatives in @entity0 who watched in 2010 as a fired - up @entity89 captured both houses of the state legislature for the first time since @entity93			1
@entity1 is fast becoming a proving ground for advisers to @entity14 and @entity96 , who stress that the presidential race will be decided by the slimmest of margins in a handful of states			1
turning out voters is key " the election is going to be won by the candidate who gets their voters to the polls , " said state rep. @entity103 , a @entity48 from @entity104 and the chairwoman of the @entity106			1
" that 's where the election is going to be determined			0
we need to focus on the people who are registered to vote and get them active and participating in the process			0
" a popular talking point among @entity38 here involves the celebrated " youth vote " of 2008 , a key part of the @entity14 coalition			1
the share of voters under 30 was the same in @entity1 as it was nationally			1
but thanks in large part to the stout organizational efforts of the @entity14 campaign on more than 100 college campuses across the state , voters between 18 and 29 chose @entity14 over @entity26 by a stunning 74 % -26 % margin			1
if that split more closely resembled the youth vote nationwide -- 66 % for @entity14 and 32 % for @entity26 -- roughly 60,000 @entity1 votes would have swung to @entity26 , handing him the state and its 15 electoral votes			1
even the slightest shifts in turnout can determine the race , a prospect relished by @entity38 , who were hamstrung in the last election by dampened conservative enthusiasm and a superior @entity3 ground game			2
" @entity26 did very little in @entity1 , and @entity14 did everything , " said @entity145 , a @entity38 strategist in @entity0			1
" the @entity26 campaign 's presence was minimal at best			0
while that was happening , the @entity14 campaign was knocking on the doors , not only of swing voters but of solid @entity38 voters			2
" the @entity96 campaign recently moved a state director to @entity0 and is piggybacking off the early joint efforts of the @entity89 and the @entity156 , which have opened four field offices so far			1
outsourcing of jobs could be problem for @entity96 @entity96 , though , has his own challenges to overcome			2
the @entity14 campaign has painted the former @entity166 executive as a corporate raider who shut down factories for the sake of a profit , a message they are pushing aggressively in a state racked by the outsourcing of textile and furniture manufacturing jobs			2
to win statewide in @entity1 , @entity38 must sway evangelicals and " @entity177 " -- those white cultural conservatives loyal to the late sen. @entity179 -- in the eastern part of the state			1
but the former @entity183 governor struggled to rally conservatives throughout the @entity38 primaries , particularly in the @entity43			0
@entity186 , the @entity106 leader , said @entity96 's @entity188 faith might be a drag among among the social conservatives who showed up in large numbers last week to vote for a constitutional amendment defining marriage solely as between a man and a woman			2
opinion : @entity1 gay marriage vote spells the end of @entity14 " if they look at that awful ballot amendment , and they compare that with his faith , i do n't think people will be ok with it , " @entity186 said			1
" from what i understand about the @entity188 faith you can have multiple wives			0
that 's sort of a contradiction			0
there are questions about who @entity96 is and what he believes in terms of that particular issue			2
" still , republicans in the state said that antipathy toward @entity14 will be enough to galvanize the conservative base			2
@entity145 , the @entity89 strategist , calmly predicted that if @entity96 runs the aggressive campaign in @entity1 that @entity26 did not -- and focuses on the economy and suburban voters -- " he should win by a substantial margin			1
" @entity96 looks for advantage in @entity1 that forecast is not limited to @entity38			1
one senior @entity1 @entity48 , who insisted on anonymity because of involvement in multiple statewide and legislative campaigns , said private polling in a variety of state races shows that white voters and independents are trending toward republicans in an alarming way			1
" the biggest thing @entity14 has got to overcome here is his problems with white independent voters , those middle - of - the - road voters , " the @entity48 said			2
" if he does n't , we are going to get our asses whipped like i have never seen in my 20 years of doing politics			0
" the @entity48 predicted a " bloodbath " for the party in november if those numbers fail to tighten			0
holding the convention in @entity46 , this person said , might make for an exciting week but will do little to push the state in @entity14 's direction : " i 'm glad that it 's here for sheer state pride , but is it going to make much difference at @entity260 in @entity261 ? " finding new voters critical for @entity14 's chances @entity14 won 35 % of @entity1 whites in 2008 , a number most @entity3 say he needs to come close to matching again if he hopes to win the state , even with the help of a growing minority population that could give him some numerical breathing room			1
and yet @entity38 and @entity3 agree that if any campaign can overcome the daunting arithmetic , it 's @entity14 's			1
his campaign excelled here in 2008 as it worked college campuses and @entity32 - @entity31 communities hard , capitalizing on early voting and same - day registration to bank a significant number of votes before @entity281			2
@entity14 for @entity31 has 15 field offices around the state			2
more are slated to open in the coming months			0
some organizers never left the state after 2008 , and the campaign hired 22 new staffers last month			2
campaign volunteers also went to work under the radar in several local campaigns last year -- including the @entity46 mayor 's race and school board races in populous @entity294 -- to elect friendly @entity3 and identify new voters			2
finding those new voters will be critical for the @entity14 team as they try to grow the electorate from 2008 , and the steady @entity1 population boom offers a fertile hunting ground			1
in april alone , the campaign registered 15,000 new voters			2
" kids who were freshmen and sophomores in college in 2008 are gone , they are not on campus anymore , " said @entity302 , a @entity3 consultant advising gubernatorial candidate @entity303			1
" but the upside is that you also have a whole new crop of students to register and organize and motivate			0
and if the campaign can do that , and they certainly have the infrastructure in place to do it , they will reap a lot of votes			0
" how @entity14 is using student loan issue to recapture the youth vote out - of - staters continue to flock to the financial hub of @entity46 , home to @entity324 , and to the @entity0 - @entity326 area for jobs in the high - tech and pharmaceutical sectors			2
more than half the @entity1 vote is concentrated in 13 counties along the @entity333 corridor , and those areas have grown dramatically since @entity14 won in 2008			1
nearly 1 million people will reside in @entity46 's @entity336 -- the state 's largest -- by the end of this year , according to estimates from the @entity340			0
that 's up from a population of 888,730 in 2008			0
in @entity294 , the heart of the @entity345 , the population has jumped by nearly 100,000 over the same four - year span			0
though the rural - to - urban trend has defined the state 's politics over the last decade , some @entity3 said that @entity14 's organization can only take him so far in a state with decidedly moderate tendencies and a 9.7 % unemployment rate -- the fourth highest in the nation			1
" i do n't think mechanics alone do it , " said @entity57 , the former @entity59 adviser			0
" an essential part of @entity14 winning here is to reignite the spark			1
idealism , hope , whatever it is			0
he had an ability to inspire last time			0
without that , he ca n't win			0

president @entity14 won @entity1 in 2008 election by less than 15,000 votes
@entity89 strategists predict an aggressive @entity96 can win state by " substantial margin "
finding new voters will be critical for the @entity14 team if it hopes to repeat 2008 *success*
