-- they 've been in the banking business for more than 200 years , @entity1 and @entity2 came to prominence when @entity5 was booming , specializing in personalized , discrete banking services			1
senior managing partner of @entity9 bank @entity8 , @entity1 talks to @entity0 's @entity10			1
since 1980 , the company has grown five-fold to be one of the biggest banks in @entity9			1
but growth has n't changed tradition says @entity1			2
@entity0 's @entity10 met with @entity1 in @entity16 to talk about leading the banking dynasty into today 's tumultuous financial water and what really defines @entity9 banking			2
@entity8 : i think @entity9 banking has changed , it still has a very strong position in the world 's banking , but it has changed			1
banking secrecy has evolved toward the new legislation on money laundering and so on , so confidentiality is not defined the same way today as it would have been , or not protected today as it would have been 25 years ago			0
so i think everything is changing but we restrict to some very strong principles , and i think that 's very important			0
@entity10 : we 've been talking about the fit with the @entity9 with private banking -- the @entity9 character , the @entity9 style -- last year though , you , for the first time , brought in non-swiss to be investors , managing directors who can invest in the bank , and i 'm wondering , does that in some way dilute your brand as a @entity9 bank , now you 're bringing @entity43 in ? @entity8 : @entity8 has had a profit participation system since 1991			1
we were probably the pioneer in @entity5 and probably the world at that time , so we have distributed large part of our profit to our employees at all time			0
today , out of the 3,000 or 2,700 people we have , about 1,400 have a direct participation -- can go from 10 percent to 200 or 300 percent of their salary , so in order for us to keep our best talents , and to stimulate those who would like to join the league , we have created this special group which has a participation , direct participation , in the capital of the bank			0
@entity10 : one of the principles you stick to is that you and your seven partners bear personal responsibility for the losses of the bank , your personal wealth is at stake everyday of the year , how does that impact the way you manage the bank ? @entity8 : well it certainly does make us more conservative , in terms of really remaining focused on one business , which is asset management			2
i mean we never diversify into investment banking or do any commercial activity in terms of banking and so on			0
we 've kept our business very focused and that has helped us also be quite successful			0
