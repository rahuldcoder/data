-- @entity1 would like it to be known that @entity4 athletes are made -- painstakingly -- not born			1
in a remarkable career as a 400 meters hurdler , @entity1 won gold at the 1976 and @entity8 , broke four world records and enjoyed one of sport 's greatest winning streaks -- going unbeaten for an incredible 122 races			1
known as " @entity14 " in high school for his long , frog - like limbs , @entity1 started hurdling when he was substituted in for a relay race			1
" someone got hurt and the coach said ' who wants to try hurdles ? ' " he recalls			1
" i just got up there and started doing it			1
never had anyone teach me , i just learned by doing it			1
" following his track career , @entity1 formulated an assistance program that allowed athletes to accept funding from stipends and endorsements without losing their eligibility to compete at the @entity4			1
today , @entity1 is a father , chair of the @entity34 , which promotes social change through sport , and a financial consultant for an investment management bank			1
he is also a motivational speaker who aims to inspire success in a corporate environment			1
here , he tells @entity41 to the @entity42 about some of the principles that have underpinned his success , and that can apply to your own career , whether you 're chasing @entity4 gold , or just a promotion			1
first learn , then innovate ... " i won my first gold medal in ' 76			1
i was 20 years old , which is young by today 's standards			2
i was right in the middle of my third year of college , studying physics and engineering , so i had a very good grounding in the mechanics of running			1
" at @entity61 we had no track , no field , no physical therapist , no massage therapist , nothing			2
so i basically had to put together an intense training program			1
" i was very innovative , because i did n't have a lot of resources			2
i had a room mate who was a principal dancer with the @entity72 , so i learned a lot about stretching , precision body movements , things like that			1
" know the competition , know yourself ... " in any competitive environment , whether you 're in sales or marketing or whatever it is , you have to know your competition , understand who they are , do intelligent analysis on them and then you have to know yourself -- who you are and what you 're capable of doing			2
" you have to know your external environment , as well			2
" see also : @entity93 - tips for the top make time for work and leisure ... " the way i look at it , there is a ' no - compression zone , ' where you have your family , your personal life , things like your health and well being , a hobby , rest and relaxation			2
" then there 's the ' compression zone			2
' you should be ready , when you go there , for things that can affect your performance , like commuting , stress on the job , electronic distractions , media that people get addicted to , and your internal and external job politics			2
" you need to carve out enough time to be successful in both areas			1
you have to strategize , analyze , initiate and follow through			2
" adapt methods to suit your own style ... " i always saw hurdles as a form of art , because it 's very individual			2
one technique that may produce a world record for one guy could be useless for another guy			1
you really have to put it all together yourself			0
" that 's what i did			0
" see also : to reach your potential , dare to be different seek out other innovators ... " i found ways to maintain my performance through working with professionals and doing things that other people were n't doing			0
" later in my career , i had a great physical therapist who kept me out on the track			0
we were doing innovative things like ice baths back in the early 80s when everyone else thought it was crazy			0
" they were the only kind of people that i would even talk to concerning my races , because we were at a completely different level			0
" even when you 're winning , stay focused on your program ... " i never thought about ( my winning streak )			1
all i knew was that i prepared myself better than everyone else on a daily basis and every race was mine to lose			0
" i never thought about the competition			0
i only thought about the seven or eight elements of my training program that i had to check off every day			1
" my life became measured in tenths of seconds			0
i knew exactly how hard i needed to run to hit those targets			0
i knew exactly how many i needed to do , to be in a certain condition			0
i knew exactly what intervals i needed for rest time in between			0
" i had the whole thing wrapped up very scientifically			0
for me , it was like a big laboratory out there			0
" i had to think about a year of workouts and where that would put me on race day			0
" be driven , but be ethical ... " in sports , there are people who , with the assistance of enablers and illegal substances can become better , and i find most of them would be mediocre without them			0
" my career proves that you can be on top for a long period of time by doing things that come naturally			0
" see also : is good karma good for business ? it 's all about hard work ... " i started out not a talented person in track and field and just loved the sport and put so much into it that i became one of the best			1
" in basketball , football , whatever , you 're dealing with a group of people who dedicate a lot of time and energy and have a lot of work habits			0
when things get tough , they 're the last people out there			0
" those are the people that become professional athletes			0
it 's not really about talent or just being born to do it			1
that professional basketball player probably shoots 500 shots a day every day			0
