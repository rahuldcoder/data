-- the sun is not yet up over @entity3 's @entity2 but @entity4 's day has already started			1
" most days i 'm up just before 5 o'clock , " the genial @entity5 explains			1
" i get to the stables just before half past five and the track opens at 6 o'clock			2
it 's a little different to how they do it back home or in @entity13 but we have to start early because of the heat here			2
" the heat is just one of challenges faced by racehorse trainers working in the tropical climes of @entity3			1
humidity is in the range of 70 -- 80 % , while thunderstorms are an almost daily occurrence			1
" it 's a three shower a day city , " jokes @entity4 , who came to @entity3 from his native @entity5 in 2008			1
" it 's a lot hotter here , the horses sweat a lot more , so you do make subtle adjustments to counter that			2
" @entity4 is the youngest of four brothers , all successful trainers in @entity5			1
" my brothers and i have been involved [ in training ] for 25 or 30 years			2
i was part of a partnership with them until recently when the opportunity came up to set up here and train under my own name			1
" it meant transplanting his wife and three children -- triplets -- to a new country ; a gamble that seems to have paid off : " my wife loves it here and my kids are very happy			2
you just need to adjust to the way things are done here -- and sometimes they 're done a bit differently ! " @entity4 arrived with a small team and immediately made an impact on the @entity3 scene			1
in contrast to @entity5 , where racing takes place six or seven days a week , @entity60 hosts two cards a week , on friday evenings and on sundays			1
during the rest of the week the course doubles as a training ground for the 27 trainers and around 1,100 horses that are based here			2
every morning before sunrise , a gaggle of trainers can be found watching through binoculars from the viewing deck as their charges are put through their paces under the floodlights			0
as many as 30 to 40 horses may be on the track at any one time			0
after completing their laps , the thoroughbreds return to the yard , drenched in foamy white sweat , from where their grooms take them back to their air - conditioned stables			0
the majority of the horses here are sourced from overseas and shipped to the island nation as yearlings			0
" there are some from @entity95 and a few from the @entity97 and other parts of the world but the bulk of them come from @entity5 and @entity101 , because there 's no breeding industry in @entity3			1
" once they 've been here for 12 months they 're considered ' local			0
' " an important distinction : the @entity108 , @entity3 's most prestigious race and the third leg of the @entity3 ' @entity111 ' , is only open to ' local ' horses			1
" the @entity108 is everything in terms of @entity3 racing			1
it 's a time honored race			0
it 's a race that any trainer or owner or jockey would aspire to win so if we were lucky enough for that to happen on sunday that 'd be huge for us , for sure			2
it 's not easy to win			0
i ran fourth in it last year			0
" they race left handed , as we always do here			0
it 's on the turf track and it 's over 2,200m under handicap conditions so that makes it a very open race			0
my main chance , @entity138 , will be carrying top weight on sunday which will make his job difficult but i 've got a lot of faith in his ability			0
" as if on cue the dawn sky is ruptured by a flash of lightning , briefly rendering the floodlights redundant as the track is illuminated by white light			0
the horses , accustomed to the vagaries of the @entity3 climate , do not miss a stride			1
" that would be our daily thunderstorm			0
and when it rains here it really rains : we 've had two or three inches of rain here in the space of 20 minutes			0
usually the rain comes and goes very quickly -- you do n't often see rain sort of settling in for an entire day here			0
we get some pretty amazing storms here so you just work in and around it			0
" ' working around it ' and making adjustments is something @entity4 has learned to do with aplomb since he decided to crack @entity3 racing			1
in a sport of few certainties , it would perhaps be fitting if the master of reinvention , the adaptable @entity5 who arrived in @entity3 a little under four years ago , captured his first @entity108 with @entity138 on sunday .			1
