-- the suspected link between @entity3 drywall and toxic effects reported by thousands of @entity6 homeowners was strengthened monday by three preliminary reports issued by the federal government			1
the strongest link came from an analysis of air sampled inside dozens of homes containing drywall made in @entity3			1
" while the study of 51 homes detected hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde ... at concentrations below irritant levels , it is possible that the additive or synergistic effects of these and other compounds in the subject homes could cause irritant effects , " the @entity14 said in its executive summary of the study			1
two other preliminary studies found copper sulfide corrosion in metal components taken from homes containing the @entity3 drywall			1
the drywall in question was imported from 2005 through 2007 , when a housing boom and two active hurricane seasons created a shortage of building materials in the @entity40			1
since then , the product safety agency has received nearly 2,100 reports from 32 states -- but mostly from @entity44 , @entity45 and @entity46 -- of homeowners complaining of a rotten - egg smell , sickness , failed appliances , and corroded wires and pipes			1
many have moved out of their homes			2
in some cases , insurers have refused to reimburse them			0
the air study tested 41 houses containing @entity3 drywall and compared those findings with air from inside 10 homes in the same geographical areas whose homeowners had not complained , said @entity67 , president of @entity68 , which carried out the work			1
the investigators also examined materials such as copper pipes and wiring for corrosion , and looked at indoor air humidity , temperature and air exchange , he said			1
copper and silver strips were left in the homes for two weeks and then examined for corrosion , he said			1
the result : in the 41 homes containing the problem drywall , there was a " strong association " between the high levels of hydrogen sulfide and the corrosion of the metals , he said			1
" temperature , humidity and air - exchange rates also appear to be contributing factors , " @entity67 told reporters on a conference call , noting that higher moisture and temperature levels and lower air - exchange rates were connected with more corrosion			1
formaldehyde , also a potential source of irritation , was found in both complaint and noncomplaint homes , he said			1
though @entity67 cautioned that the study was not intended to examine health effects , " we can say that the levels of the pollutants we found , particularly the hydrogen sulfide and formaldehyde , could possibly contribute to some of the health problems that have been reported to the @entity14			1
" @entity67 also said that not all @entity3 drywall may be alike			1
its risk " depends on what it is made of , not necessarily what country it 's from , " he said			2
the next step is to determine how to identify homes with the corrosive materials and how to fix them , said @entity124 , the product safety agency 's director of information and public affairs , who noted that the investigation is the largest in the agency 's history			2
he said none of the tainted drywall entered the @entity40 this year			0
hundreds of thousands of suspect boards have been stockpiled in warehouses ; their owners have been told it will not be sold , he added			0
several weeks ago , agency representatives traveled to @entity3 , where they visited mines , factories and government officials to determine the scope of the problem , which is still not clear , @entity124 said			2
" the @entity14 is working hard to determine how many homes in how many states are affected , " he said , adding that the data do not support the widely reported figure of 100,000 homes			0
@entity124 said the @entity3 helped investigate			2
" they 're committed to helping us with the technical side of this investigation , " he said			0
though the study raises suspicions that the drywall is responsible for the health effects reported by some families , @entity124 said a causal association has not been proved			2
" the work continues , " he said			0
" the work toward an exact nexus between drywall and effects is still ongoing			0
" @entity124 called on the news media to help alert homeowners in affected houses to report the problem			0
some may be hesitant to report because they are afraid their insurers will drop their coverage , he said , but he pointed out that the reports can be made confidentially			2
" we will make sure that you are not harmed in any way by reporting to the government , " he said			0
monday 's report did not surprise sen. @entity179 , @entity44 , who said the product safety commission 's chairwoman , @entity180 , told him monday she did not know when further testing would be completed			0
" i am very disappointed with the whole process , and especially that the @entity184 [ @entity184 ] and @entity185 [ @entity185 ] ca n't say whether drywall is harmful to people 's health , " he told @entity0			0
" common sense says otherwise , but we still lack definitive answers			0
" @entity191 , who moved out of her townhouse in @entity193 , @entity44 , after her wiring and air conditioning failed , said monday 's report told her nothing new			2
" it was a huge letdown because it still did n't tell me how to fix it , who 's going to fix it , how do we go about fixing it , where the money comes from , " said @entity191 , who moved in with her mother			0
" this has left us in such a mess			0
" @entity0 's @entity208 contributed to this story from @entity210 , @entity44 .			0

air samples from 41 homes containing drywall made in @entity3 are analyzed
" strong association " found between high hydrogen sulfide levels , corrosion in the homes
nearly 2,100 reports detail smell , sickness , failed appliances , corrosion in homes
drywall in question was imported during @entity6 housing boom , from 2005 through 2007
