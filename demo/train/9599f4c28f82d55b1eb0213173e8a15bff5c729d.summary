got an idea on how to make a flying aircraft carrier ? the @entity3 wants to know about it			1
the @entity5 has a request out for ideas on how to develop an airborne platform that could both launch and recover other aircraft			1
but before you start looking for schematics of the @entity13 ( @entity14 - 1701 ) or @entity15 , or how you might levitate the @entity16 , think a little smaller , like b - 1 , @entity18 or @entity17			0
@entity5 wants ideas on how to turn those aircraft currently in the @entity3 inventory into platforms that could carry @entity23 , what most folks call drones , close to their targets			1
the drones could then go about their business -- bombing , missile strikes , reconnaissance , etc. -- then fly back to the mother ship and head for home			2
this plan could add to the range of the drones and open up new missions they can not now undertake because of their limited range , @entity5 says			1
as you consider your ideas , @entity5 says you have to keep the cost low and they 'd like something they could demonstrate within four years			2
and do n't get long - winded			0
your proposal should fit on eight , standard 8.5 - x 11 - inch pages in 11 - point type			0
and if you 're worried your big plans will fall into the hands of your competitors , do n't			0
@entity5 promises all ideas will stay inside the @entity3			1
the deadline is november 26			0
now get to work .			0
