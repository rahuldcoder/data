-- february 16 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : as the three - day weekend was winding down , we were here at the @entity16 last night , putting together your tuesday edition of @entity0			2
you know who i am ; let 's get right to today 's headlines ! first up : @entity24 @entity25 : making progress , but there 's still a long way to go			1
that is how one reporter in @entity4 described a military offensive there			1
the goal of @entity33 , which means " together " in the local language , is for coalition and @entity24 troops to work together in order to remove the @entity38 from @entity40 province			2
the militant group has a strong presence in that region			2
and this is the largest military operation since 2001 , when the war in @entity4 started			1
it includes about 15,000 troops			2
and one thing they 're trying to do is draw @entity38 fighters into combat			2
commanders say they expect that to last a while			2
but one of the challenges in fighting the @entity38 is doing so without hurting civilians			1
on sunday , 12 @entity24 civilians were killed when a coalition rocket hit the building they were in			2
military officials said the troops were aiming for the right building ; what they did n't know is that there were civilians inside of it			1
challenges abroad @entity25 : the war in @entity4 is just one of the challenges facing president @entity69 right now			1
over the weekend , secretary of state @entity71 said she believes that the @entity73 nation is becoming a " military dictatorship , " and she thinks that could be dangerous for other countries			1
@entity77 examines that issue and some of the other global challenges facing the @entity81 president			1
( begin video ) @entity83 , @entity0 @entity84 : two costly wars , an economy still reeling , no health care reform yet , and a political upset in @entity89 torpedoes his @entity91 supermajority			2
@entity81 president @entity69 : we 're trying to , you know , bring some change that you can believe in			1
@entity96 : with his change agenda bogged down at home , what hope is there for president @entity69 's change agenda abroad ? @entity102 , @entity103 : when @entity81 presidents get weak at home , it really does affect their ability to act abroad			1
@entity96 : in his first year , mr. @entity69 visited 21 countries			1
his mantra : engagement , even with your enemies			2
@entity71 , @entity81 secretary of state : it 's almost hard to remember how poorly much of the world viewed the @entity81 when president @entity69 came into office			1
@entity96 : the secretary of state says she sees a lot of positive trends			2
but the score card , so far , is mixed			2
@entity70 still hounds its opponents and defends its nuclear program , now boasting it 's enriching its own uranium			1
@entity124 still wo n't return to nuclear talks			2
the @entity73 peace process is stalled			2
even the president 's friends say @entity81 's credibility is on the line			1
@entity131 , @entity132 : i personally believe that the president is extremely committed to it , but we also know that @entity81 is dealing with many other issues internally , health plan , other issues			1
@entity89 was , i think , something that hit the news			1
@entity96 : but after the reset button was pressed with @entity144 , relations did improve			2
@entity145 is helping the @entity81 to pressure @entity70 and it 's close to a new arms control agreement with @entity148			1
but in @entity158 , cyber attacks against @entity81 companies like @entity157 , disputes over arm sales to @entity151 , and a controversial visit to the @entity153 this week by the @entity154 have relations with @entity6 at a boil			2
surprisingly , the administration does claim one success , in a war @entity69 opposed			1
@entity81 vice president @entity165 : i am very optimistic about @entity167			1
i think it 's going to be one of the great achievements of this administration			1
@entity172 , white house press secretary : putting what was broken back together and getting our troops home , which we intend to do in august of this year			2
( @entity178 ) @entity179 @entity25 : when we recorded this show last night , the @entity81 was leading the medal count at the @entity183			2
but the @entity185 games got off to a tragic start			0
a 21 - year - old olympian from the @entity5 , a country between @entity144 and @entity189 , died in an accident on the luge track			0
a memorial was set up for @entity193			0
just a couple hours before the opening ceremonies , he was on his last training run at the @entity196 when he lost control of his sled and crashed			0
the @entity199 said the crash happened because @entity193 did n't make up for a mistake he 'd made on his run			0
a lot of people are afraid this course was just too fast , and since the crash , @entity207 workers have shortened it and made it safer by building up the walls near where the crash happened			0
multi-car @entity214 @entity25 : it 's been relatively warm in @entity185 , but winter weather is taking a toll on parts of the @entity81 look at this pile - up that shut down a @entity222 overpass on sunday ! unbelievable			1
dozens of cars involved , traffic shut down for hours			0
there were injuries in this wreck , but everyone did survive			0
this is really interesting , though : we want you to take a listen to what it was like to be in the pile - up			0
@entity237 , motorist in car pile - up : it happened too fast			0
it was just there and i headed for the guardrail and it did n't move			0
and then i just kept getting nailed			0
@entity244 @entity245 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to ms. @entity248 's 7th grade class in @entity249 , @entity250 ! how many animals are included in the @entity6 calendar ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) 5 , b ) 7 , c ) 12 or @entity259 ) 24 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! there are 12 animals associated with the @entity6 calendar			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity265 @entity25 : and we are now in the @entity267 ! sunday marked the start of the @entity265 , and this is actually year 4708 on the @entity6 calendar			1
and as it began , @entity6 's premier , @entity269 , praised the country for working through the worldwide economic crisis , but he warned that this new year could be a complicated one			1
the traditional celebrations to ring in the @entity267 were massive			1
parades , performances , fireworks seen all over the country and in other parts of the world			0
hundreds of millions of people across @entity6 traveled home for the holiday			0
that is why some folks believe that @entity265 is the world 's biggest , annual human migration			1
@entity286 @entity25 : another big celebration taking place in @entity289 right now			0
it 's @entity286 ! what you 're seeing here is the @entity295 parade			1
it 's one of the many events that are part of the celebration			1
and the @entity295 , at least this year , is @entity301 quarterback @entity300 ! the city of @entity289 is still riding high after their recent @entity304 win			0
and the crowds came out to see @entity300 , who was the mvp of the game , and maybe catch one of the mini-footballs he threw from the float			0
@entity286 is a @entity310 name that means @entity286			0

shoutout @entity316 @entity317 , @entity14 : time for a @entity318 ! which of these equations represents acceleration due to gravity on @entity323 ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) a2 + b2 = c2 , b ) g = 9.8 m / s2 , c ) a = pi r2 or @entity259 ) e = mc2 ? rewind the clock to three seconds -- go ! acceleration due to force of @entity323 's gravity is equal to 9.8 meters per second , squared			1
that 's your answer and that 's your @entity318 ! math and science @entity25 : so , can getting rid of gravity help inspire education ? one company thinks so , and it 's hoping students will too			1
some folks are worried that the @entity81 is falling behind in math and science because not enough students are interested in the subjects			1
they 're hoping that seeing this will change that			0
it 's a program where teachers float around in zero gravity and prove there 's a fun side to math and science			1
@entity356 recently went along for the ride			0
@entity358 , @entity0 correspondent : how does it work ? we 're seated when the plane first starts to climb			0
then , after we level off , we all have to lie on the floor of this padded cabin			0
we 're taken on a series of so - called parabolas			0
the plane makes a steep climb , then practically dives for about 30 seconds			0
we have to lie on our backs			0
we 're about to do the first parabola , called a partial parabola			0
we 're going to be at about one - third of our body weight when this thing hits its peak and then starts descending			0
when the plane dives , we 're at zero gravity			0

it happened at the @entity409 in @entity410			0
with 400 balls and more than 1,200 players , we 're not sure how the organizers could really keep score of it			0
goodbye @entity25 : we guess that when anyone asked , they just dodged the question			0
