@entity0 -- as president @entity3 gets ready on wednesday to spell out @entity5 proposals to curb gun violence , three new national polls indicate a majority of @entity8 support most gun control measures			1
but they are divided by political party , gender , age , race and education over some of the proposals			1
the polls released this week came one month after a gunman killed 26 people , including 20 children , at @entity22 in @entity23 , @entity24			2
the tragedy seemed to be make an impact			0
by a 51 % -45 % margin , @entity8 questioned in a new @entity29 poll say it 's more important to control gun ownership than to protect gun rights			1
an equal 51 % questioned in a new @entity35 / @entity34 survey say controlling gun ownership is more important than protecting the right of @entity8 to own firearms			2
and by a 52 % -35 % margin , a new @entity41 / @entity40 survey indicates the public says it is more likely to support some forms of gun control after last month 's massacre			1
support for gun control rose after last summer 's mass shooting at an @entity51 , @entity52 , theater and the january 2011 shooting of then - rep. @entity54 and others in @entity56 but not at the same rate as after the @entity23 tragedy			1
@entity3 to announce gun control plans wednesday but the country is still divided on the issue			2
" support for gun control is rising modestly since last month 's shootings , but still largely divides the country close to 50 - 50 , " @entity1 senior political analyst and @entity64 's editorial director @entity63 said			1
and that split follows the same track demographically as the split in last november 's presidential election			0
" there is strong support for action on guns inside the modern @entity77 coalition of minorities , millenials and college educated white women and strong opposition among blue - collar and rural white voters , " @entity63 added			0
" at the national level that means @entity77 were wrong to conclude this issue was a loser after vice president @entity88 was defeated in the 2000 election			0
democrats were paralyzed by the fear of losing voters they had largely already lost and failing to respond to the voters who actually vote for them			0
" the divide is also apparent when it comes to specific proposals to limit gun violence that are being considered by the president			2
@entity5 press secretary @entity100 said tuesday that @entity3 would spell out his proposals on gun - control legislation and executive actions on wednesday			2
@entity105 membership up @entity106 in last month according to the @entity29 survey , 85 % of the public backs making private gun sales and purchases at gun shows subject to background checks , with comparable support across party lines			1
it 's a similar story in an @entity41 / @entity40 poll , where nearly nine in 10 favor such background checks , with broad backing from @entity77 , @entity120 and independent voters			1
the @entity29 poll indicates that eight in 10 favor laws to prevent mentally ill people from purchasing guns , again with bipartisan support			2
and a @entity35 / @entity34 survey finds nearly six in 10 backing the banning of bullets that explode or penetrate bulletproof vests , with majority support across party lines			2
but on other proposals where there is overall majority support , such as creating a federal database to track gun sales , bans on assault style weapons , high capacity ammunition clips , and online ammunition sales , the polls indicate wide differences of opinions between @entity77 and @entity120			1
the president says when it comes to gun violence , he 's not concerned about politics			0
" my starting point is not to worry about the politics but to focus on what makes sense and what works , " @entity3 said at a monday news conference			0
but the polls indicate that the divides on the issue are not just @entity157 vs. @entity120			0
@entity158 to pass nation 's first gun control bill since @entity23 shooting the @entity34 poll indicates that those ages 18 - 29 are most supportive of stricter gun control , and that minorities overwhelmingly favor prioritizing gun control over gun owners rights , with 52 % of white respondents saying protecting gun ownership is most important			1
the @entity29 survey indicates that men are divided on this question , while a solid majority of women say it 's more important to control gun ownership			1
there 's also a sizable gender gap over a ban on semi-automatic weapons , with two - thirds of women supporting such a move and men divided			0
according to the @entity41 / @entity40 poll , 44 % say there is at least one gun in their home , and that those people are less supportive of a number of the anti-gun violence measures being proposed			1
the powerful @entity105 is fiercely opposed to any ban on assault - style weapons			0
the @entity41 / @entity40 poll indicates 36 % of the public has favorable views of the group 's leaders , with 44 % saying they have an unfavorable view , and one in five saying they have no opinion on the @entity105 's leaders			1
thirty - eight percent say the @entity105 has " too much influence , " with 24 % feeling it has " too little " influence , and three in ten saying the organization has the right amount of sway			0
last month the @entity105 proposed placing armed security guards or police in the nation 's schools			0
fifty - five percent of those questioned in the @entity41 / @entity40 survey and nearly two - thirds of those questioned in the @entity29 poll support that suggestion			1
but the @entity29 survey highlights an educational divide on the question			0
fewer than half of college graduates support a proposal to put armed guards or police in more schools , while three - quarters of those with no more than a high school education favor the idea			0
@entity233 spoke with @entity23 families , son says			0
