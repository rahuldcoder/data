@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 authorities have discovered about 30 tons of marijuana that were part of a smuggling operation using a tunnel under the @entity1 - @entity11 border , officials said wednesday			1
the 600 - yard tunnel -- which features a rail system , lighting and ventilation -- connects a warehouse in @entity17 with one in the @entity19 industrial area of @entity20 , said @entity22 spokeswoman @entity21			1
about 26 tons of marijuana had been transported through the tunnel to @entity20 , and 10 of those tons were intercepted tuesday by authorities as a tractor trailer was transporting the load from the @entity19 warehouse , officials said			1
about five tons were found by the @entity11 military inside the @entity17 warehouse and the tunnel , officials said			1
drug cartels on the border have become so powerful and sophisticated in recent years that many @entity11 communities and areas along the border are patches of uncontrollable violence , experts have said			2
" it 's not a good day for the cartels , " said @entity22 director @entity42			1
" they now ca n't move that size of drugs without digging a tunnel for 600 yards			2
" obviously this is a cartel and organized drug smuggling of the highest order , " @entity42 added			0
authorities were n't able to identify wednesday which cartel was behind the tunnel operation , he said			0
the smuggling was active for about a month until this week 's seizure			0
the tunnel was rather small , and an individual ca n't stand up in it , @entity42 said			2
he described the railway as " crude			0
" the seizure was also unusual because authorities made their bust while the smuggling was active , @entity42 said			0
" we caught them in the act , " @entity42 said			1
" we find these tunnels and they 're usually abandoned			0
" the seizure was also one of the largest on the @entity1 - @entity11 border , officials said			2
" what 's unusual about this one is the amount of marijuana found as part of this investigation , " @entity76 said			1
the 30 tons is considered significant by @entity5 and @entity11 authorities even though @entity11 authorities seized 105 tons of marijuana in @entity17 last month , the largest @entity11 bust in recent years , @entity76 said			1
" so there 's been some pretty big drug busts , " she said			0
" we 're not letting our guard down			0
" in the past four years , 75 smuggling tunnels have been discovered on the @entity5 - @entity11 border , most of them in @entity1 and @entity94 , authorities said			1
in all , about 125 tunnels have been found since the early 1990s , when authorities began keeping count , with just one of them on the @entity5 - @entity102 border , @entity76 said			2
authorities will be investigating the owners of the @entity17 and @entity20 warehouses , officials said			1
a special @entity5 border tunnel task force hunts for underground smuggling operations in and around @entity20			1
the task force consists of agents from @entity22 , the @entity111 and the @entity5 @entity112 , and they also work with @entity11 authorities , @entity76 said			1
in its surveillance of the @entity19 warehouse , the task force noticed suspicious activity tuesday when they saw a tractor - trailer leave the facility			0
agents followed the truck to a @entity112 checkpoint at @entity124 , @entity1 , and authorities found 10 tons of marijuana hidden in cardboard boxes on pallets , said @entity22 director @entity42			1
a married couple driving the truck was arrested , he said			0
the task force became the first of its kind in 2003 , when it was assembled to deal with a growing number of underground smuggling routes on the @entity1 - @entity11 border			2
the unit was also assembled as part of a post-september 11 security concerns , @entity76 said			0
the longest tunnel discovered , found in 2006 , had a length of seven football fields			0
that tunnel also connected warehouses in @entity19 and @entity17			1
the task force uses robots to scout out a newly discovered tunnel before agents are sent into it			0
federal agents are trained like miners on how to negotiate confined spaces , and the @entity20 - @entity11 region is even used to test the latest ground - penetrating technology to detect tunnels , including by the @entity5 military , @entity76 said			1
the sophisticated tunnels -- with lighting , oxygen pumps and rail lines -- are typically used to ferry drugs from @entity11 to the @entity5			2
the more rudimentary tunnels are just big enough to smuggle people into the country , @entity76 said			0
" we 've also been enjoying an unprecedented cooperation with @entity11 law enforcement in recent years , " @entity76 said			0
" so we get a lot of information from the @entity11 , and vice versa			0
