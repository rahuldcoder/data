-- a @entity3 college has modified a controversial security policy after criticism it infringed on the religious rights of students , a school official said friday			1
the policy originally banned any head covering that obscured the student 's face while engaged in student activities			1
the @entity14 e-mailed students about the initial changes this week , saying , " any head covering that obscures a student 's face may not be worn , either on campus or at clinical sites , except when required for medical reasons			1
" school officials said the policy was intended to ensure that all students would be identifiable " for reasons of safety and security			2
" but on thursday , the policy was changed to include an exception " for medical and / or religious reasons			1
" the original policy had prompted questions and concerns among @entity36 students and organizations , particularly because it meant @entity36 women at the college could no longer wear the niqab , or face veil			1
the college -- with campuses in @entity45 and @entity46 , @entity3 , as well as @entity47 , @entity42 -- stated that the initial modification was " based on a constructive dialogue with our extended community , and an intensive review of safety and security measures with advisors			0
" college spokesman @entity56 said , " we will achieve our objective of campus security while allowing for a medical and / or religious accommodation			2
as always , our primary concern is the security and safety of all our students , faculty and staff			2
" @entity56 stressed that @entity36 were involved in the original policy decision saying , " prior to implementation , the college discussed it with several officials within the @entity49			1
" @entity36 students had mixed reactions to the original ban			1
@entity74 , president of the @entity75 at the college , called the unmodified policy " unjustified and unconstitutional			0
" @entity74 , who does not wear the niqab , said that having to wear student ids at all times keeps students safe			2
@entity82 , communications director for the @entity83 , thinks the policy targeted @entity36 students and filed a third - party complaint with the @entity86			1
writing to the commission , the @entity83 invoked @entity88 , which prohibits employers from discriminating based on religion			0
@entity82 acknowledged that the college 's policy focuses on students but said it will inevitably target @entity36 employees in the future			1
after the complaint , @entity97 , the vice president for @entity98 , e-mailed @entity82 , announcing the new policy			0
" we have reviewed our @entity104 policy and made an accommodation for religious reasons , " the e-mail said			1
" thank you for your input on this matter			0
" @entity82 then stated , " we are pleased that the religious rights of all students and staff will now be protected			2
this is a victory for religious freedom and tolerance			0
" @entity56 said , " the complaint was not the sole reason for the reversal but rather an ongoing discussion this week with our community			0
" @entity121 , director of the @entity122 , supported the original policy			1
though @entity121 acknowledged the larger cultural debate , he said the college is focusing on security			0
" i have documented dozens and dozens of cases about criminality and terrorism that have been abetted by burqas and niqabs , " he said			0
" it is sensible to ban these , and there are a number of these bans in institutions such as banks or jewelry stores			0
" with increasing concern about terrorist attacks , religious practices will have to be weighed against security , @entity121 said			0
" in @entity145 , the hijab has been banned from government offices , so this is not something that is just an @entity148 concern , " he added .			0
