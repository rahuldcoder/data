hours before the @entity1 votes on whether to arm @entity3 rebels to fight @entity4 , a thinly veiled smackdown broke out on thursday between sens. @entity6 and @entity7 about the issue			1
it was the latest episode in a public feud that has implications over the future of the @entity13			0
@entity6 railed against the notion that arming @entity3 rebels is going to be an effective tactic to fight @entity4 , lambasting what he called " barnacled enablers " for pushing a policy that he said will harm @entity21 interests in the long run			1
" they 've never met a war they did n't like , " @entity6 said on the @entity1 floor thursday of the " @entity25 crowd " without naming names			0
@entity6 has been embroiled in a bitter debate within his party over foreign policy , especially with @entity7			1
the debate between the two has become personal as @entity7 has labeled @entity6 an isolationist and as having a " fundamental lack of understanding " of international threats			2
why @entity6 ca n't shake isolationist image @entity6 , who is considering a presidential run , did not mention @entity7 's name , but references to the long - time @entity41 were peppered throughout			2
" what we have here is a failure to understand , " @entity6 said , that " intervention creates chaos			0
" in a very thinly veiled swipe , @entity6 once again brought up a debunked report that @entity7 took pictures with members of @entity4 before he completely understood the dynamics of the group			0
" to those who wish unlimited intervention and boots on the ground everywhere , remember the smiling poses of politicians pontificating about so - called freedom fighters and heroes in @entity62 , in @entity3 and @entity63 unaware of that the so - called freedom fighters may well have been allied with kidnappers and killers and jihadists , " @entity6 said			2
@entity6 says that arming @entity3 before we have a complete understanding of who they are and where their alliances align is dangerous			1
" it 's absurd , " @entity6 said of the policy			0
" we should n't be fighting alongside jihadists			0
" moments after @entity6 finished his speech , @entity7 took to the microphone and pushed back against that argument , insisting moderate fighters do exist in @entity3			1
" what 's their solution ? " @entity7 rhetorically asked opponents , including @entity6			0
this is @entity6 's question : " when will we quit listening to the advocates who have been wrong about every foreign policy position of the last two decades ? " the @entity1 is voting on a government spending package to fund the government and in it is a measure to allow arming and training @entity3 rebels .			1
