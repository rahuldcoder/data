@entity1 , @entity0 -- beautiful and intelligent , and balancing a modern outlook with a deep concern for her people , @entity4 's @entity3 seems in many ways to represent the optimistic face of the @entity11 's future			1
not just a pretty face : queen @entity3 has used her position to fight for better education for @entity4 youth			1
since she entered the spotlight after she married then prince @entity17 in 1993 , she has become known for her philanthropic work , pushing for better educational facilities for @entity4 's school children and supporting efforts to empower women			1
feted by the @entity23 ( she has been interviewed countless times , including a half - hour appearance on @entity26 ) , she was named the third most beautiful woman in the world by @entity29 and @entity3 magazine in 2005			1
she has used her considerable status -- @entity32 ranks her 81 in the world 's 100 most powerful women -- to correct what she sees as misconceptions in the @entity23 about the @entity38 world			1
a beacon of hope then in a troubled region ? not exactly			2
the reality behind the picture perfect image is more complex			2
to a large extent @entity3 remains a paradox -- a symbol of the contradictions that still blight the region as it tries to come to terms with modernity			1
she is the business graduate who left her job at a multinational to marry into a monarchy that has ruled @entity4 for the last 60 years , at times with an iron rod			1
she may talk passionately about freedom of speech and equal rights			2
yet @entity4 's own human rights record under the stewardship of her husband @entity17 has hardly been exemplary , and has included accusations of terrorist suspects being tortured , harsh laws to clamp down on public dissent and the arrest without trial of critics of the government			1
@entity4 also has one of the highest incidences in the @entity11 of honor killings -- the practice of women being killed by male family members if they engage in pre-martial sex			1
to her credit , @entity3 is not burying her head in the sand over the problems of @entity4			1
she acknowledges , for example , that unemployment rates among young people stand at 25 percent , double the global average , and that " creating jobs is one of the most important priorities for us			2
" the daughter of @entity88 parents , she is also acutely aware of the severe social problems that conflict has created in the wider region			0
she talks about a " hope - gap " in trouble spots such as @entity95 and @entity88 areas , where young people can be sucked into a vortex of violence and where there are few , if any opportunities to rescue them			0
" it 's all about providing that opportunity , a sense of hope for the future generation because i believe that if that future generation is growing without that sense of hope , then we are looking at a very dangerous situation			2
" faced with so many complexities in the current political and social climate in the @entity11 , it 's perhaps not that surprising that @entity3 is focusing so much of her energy on young people			1
as well as efforts to improve education , she has initiated an online debate on the video sharing site @entity119			0
the queen is asking viewers to send in comments about their ideas of @entity124 and the @entity38 world			1
she then appears and discusses her reaction to the comments			0
the conversation is due to run until @entity129 on august 12			0
" when i 'm in the @entity23 i 'm asked why do the @entity38 hate us ? when i 'm in the @entity38 world i hear very negative comments about the @entity23 , " she told @entity2			0
" the rising tensions between both sides is a fact of life , i do n't think that anyone can deny it			0
" she wanted to take the debate online and ask young people to participate in order to " bring them into the conversation because they are the ones that can change the discourse			0
" she said the @entity145 is a force for free speech , and that greater communications are making it harder for authoritarian regimes to stifle dialogue			2
" if you do n't like the comments that are out there the best way to tackle it is to respond to them and to put your side of the story			0
" a mother - of - four , she believes that young people should be allowed to be involved in the political process , not only because she is concerned they 're being denied a voice but also because she says she thinks they have a huge amount to offer			0
she said young people need to be seen as " active agents as opposed to just persons in the making and to do that we really need to educate them , engage them and empower them in the decision - making process			0
" that her idealistic pronouncements can seem at odds with the reality on the ground is not surprising , given just how difficult that reality is			0
that she cares enough to try and make difference is only to her credit .			0
