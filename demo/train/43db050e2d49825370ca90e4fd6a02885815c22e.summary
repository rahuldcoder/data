@entity0 -- @entity2 rallies his troops in @entity5 's play of the same name before the @entity7 with these words : " once more unto the breach , dear friends , once more ... when the blast of war blows in our ears then initiate the action of the tiger			1
stiffen the sinews , summon up the blood			0
" @entity20 's call to action is cited as one of the most motivational speeches in history , and the @entity24 would no doubt have hoped for similarly inspiring words and good pr from his namesake descendant , prince @entity27 , in interviews timed to coincide with his departure from @entity31			1
but as the prince recalled the " taste of blood " in his mouth as he waited to attack @entity35 insurgents from his helicopter gunship , his comments appear to have stirred up as much mockery and controversy as sympathy			1
prince @entity27 on @entity31 mission : ' take a life to save a life ' the third - in - line to the @entity47 throne , known in the military as captain @entity49 , also compared having his finger on the trigger of rockets , missiles and a 30mm cannon to playing video games			1
" it 's a joy for me			2
i am one of those people who loves playing @entity61 and @entity62 and so i am good with my thumbs , i like to think that i am quite useful			0
" in @entity31 , the media - savvy @entity35 seized on the remarks and called @entity27 a " coward " for only speaking when he was out of danger			1
" this prince comes and compares this war with his games , @entity73 or whatever he calls it , " @entity68 told the @entity69			2
" to describe the war in @entity31 as a game demeans anyone -- especially a prince , who is supposed to be made of better things			1
" even an @entity31 parliamentarian admitted @entity27 's comments could risk damaging relations			1
@entity82 told the newspaper : " this makes the withdrawal process much faster , because for now half of the people say the foreign forces must stay for longer , but if they say these kind of things then more people will want them to go home			0
" prince @entity27 also appeared to acknowledge that he killed insurgents on his four - month tour of duty in @entity93			1
he said it was sometimes justified to " take a life to save a life			0
that 's what we revolve around , i suppose			2
" " our job out here is to make sure the guys are safe on the ground and if that means shooting someone who is shooting at them , then we will do it			0
" the comments set social media alight , with comments both in favour and critical of the prince			1
the @entity47 tabloids also splashed the story about him across their front pages : the @entity118 's headline was : " @entity27 kills @entity35 chief : hero prince in missile strike on commander " in @entity47 , the @entity123 criticized the 28 - year - old 's comments as " crass " and questioned how he knew those he 'd killed were actually members of the @entity35			1
" in recent months many civilians have been killed by air strikes			2
this arrogant and insensitive attitude to killing @entity31 , whoever they are , is hardly likely to win hearts and minds -- a supposed aim of the war , " said the group 's convener @entity129			1
in the @entity137 , one commentator mocked @entity27 's language			1
" this is captain @entity49 's new incarnation : killer captain ! " wrote @entity141			2
referring to the occasion when @entity27 was photographed naked in a @entity145 hotel room , @entity141 added : " during his deployment in 2007 - 08 , captain @entity49 spoke of his frustration at not being able to partake in actual action			2
no more ! now he drops gung - ho aphorisms like @entity150 ( " take a life to save a life " ) and the young chap who only months before was photographed with his fingers in the most curious of places during a game of " strip billiards " in @entity145 has since placed those same fingers " on the triggers of deadly rockets , missiles and a 30mm cannon			0
" while many analysts in @entity47 praised @entity27 for risking his life to support ground troops in @entity93 , one politician questioned the tone of his remarks			1
opposition defense spokesman @entity170 said : " i 'm not going to second guess whether he should or should n't have said it			0
" he 's obviously a young and brave man			0
perhaps he may have been more candid than the @entity172 may have wished			0
" in the interviews , @entity27 said he relished the relative freedom -- largely away from the scrutiny of the world 's media -- that serving in the military offered him			1
" it 's very easy to completely forget about who i am when i am in the army , " he told reporters			0
but he added that he would prefer to have been serving on the ground than as an airman based at @entity185 along with 4,000 other @entity47 service personnel			2
" my choice would have been back out on the ground with my regiment , " he said			0
" for me it 's not that normal because i go into the cookhouse and everyone has a good old gawp , and that 's one thing that i dislike about being here			0
which is probably another reason why i 'd love to be out in the @entity197 [ patrol bases ] , away from it all			0
" in his interviews the prince makes little attempt at all to hide his antipathy towards the media and the tabloids in particular			0
" everyone 's guilty for buying the papers ... though hopefully no one believes what they read			0
" but after reading the criticism of his own comments , he may want to reflect on another famous line from @entity5 's " @entity2 " : " men of few words are the best men			2

prince @entity27 's comments about @entity31 stir up mockery , controversy -- and sympathy
@entity35 brand @entity27 as " coward " for only speaking when he was out of danger
@entity31 parliamentarian says @entity27 's comments could risk damaging relations
@entity47 *anti-war* *campaigners* ask how @entity27 knew those he 'd killed were @entity35
