-- almost before the smoke had cleared at @entity3 , he had enlisted to serve his country in the @entity5			0
he viewed the war in the @entity7 through the bomb sight of a @entity9 as a second lieutenant and was awarded the @entity11 for bravery			0
when he got home to @entity14 , he was eventually elected to @entity15 and served 34 years , including a term as speaker of the @entity18			1
but @entity19 found out the other day he was n't qualified to vote in the election in his home state			1
@entity19 , who no longer drives at 90 , tried to get a voter card under a new @entity14 law and was told his expired driver 's license and university lecturer 's @entity26 were not adequate proof of his identity			1
a war hero and former congressman had to go home and dig through old files to return with his birth certificate			2
hurrah for the flag of the free ? although there has been only one indicted incident of voter fraud in @entity14 since 2000 , gov. @entity37 and the @entity39 - controlled legislature passed a stringent voter id law			1
@entity37 had argued impersonators jeopardized the sanctity of elections			0
there had been , however , only four such cases on file with the @entity14 attorney general from 2008 to 2010 , a brief time span during which 13 million people cast ballots			2
that data had much to do with the federal courts tossing out the @entity14 @entity26 law as discriminatory against minorities			1
but a @entity59 ruling on the @entity60 immediately reinstated the @entity14 @entity26 law -- which by design was intended to discriminate , as a lower court said			1
@entity14 conservatives and other states pushing voter id laws are facing demographic destinies they can not avoid			1
the laws of mathematics might have prompted the laws of discrimination			0
according to @entity74 figures , in 1990 , white children younger than 18 outnumbered @entity75 in @entity14 by 843,000			2
the 2010 numbers were an almost exact reversal with 995,000 more @entity79 kids than whites			0
assuming new @entity79 voters will follow familiar trends and tend to vote for @entity85 , the end of the story for the @entity39 might just be biology			0
the average white female in @entity14 , and the rest of the country , is 41 with a fertility rate of 1.9 , according to @entity74 figures and and the @entity14 state demographer @entity92			1
the @entity79 female average age , meanwhile , is 25 with a fertility rate of 2.7			0
no need to be a mathematician to draw that graph			0
women , in fact , are the most likely to be jeopardized by the new @entity14 law , which requires a government issued photo id to have your name be " substantially similar " to how it appears on registration rolls			1
unfortunately , divorces , taking a husband 's surname , remarriages and retaining maiden names serve to create conflicts between old registrations and current ids for women			0
and because younger women do n't immediately update their government documentation after marriage , a survey by the @entity117 indicates about 34 % of them wo n't be qualified to vote because their names will not match state records			1
because there 's no way to measure what does n't happen , we ca n't know how many women simply did not vote in the election this week because they did n't have the appropriate photo id			1
the political impact of this plot is expected to be disproportionately significant with the gubernatorial candidacy of state sen. @entity133 , which will likely increase turnout of female voters			0
unsurprisingly , @entity137 , who is divorced , encountered the problem when she went to cast her ballot in the statewide constitutional election , the first to be held under the law			0
she was allowed to vote after signing an affidavit confirming she was , indeed , a senator and resident of the state			2
@entity137 ' likely @entity39 opponent for governor is @entity14 attorney general @entity149			2
his name did n't match registration records			0
his campaign manager said @entity149 , too , would have to sign an affidavit			0
@entity149 , a big supporter of the photo requirement , would not have been able to vote had it not been for @entity137 passing a last - minute amendment to the voter id law that allowed the signing of sworn documents to enable voting when records did not match			1
@entity137 , essentially , saved the state 's attorney general from disenfranchising himself			0
and if a law nearly victimizes people with resources and advanced educations , consider its implications for the poor			2
up to a million registered voters in @entity14 could be without a valid @entity26 to be eligible to participate in elections			2
how many did not show up at the polls november 5 because of worries about ids ? and @entity14 is n't exactly making it easy to acquire one , especially if you are a minority			1
first , identification has to be confirmed with a document such as a birth certificate , which costs $ 22 in @entity14			2
the prospective voter can use that to get a driver 's license -- but 81 counties out of the state 's 254 do n't even have a @entity187 office			1
@entity59 testimonies showed that some people would have to drive 250 miles to reach a @entity187 facility and that in those counties , @entity79 were twice as likely as whites to be without a vehicle			0
it 's not exactly simple for wage earners in urban areas , either			0
there are almost no @entity187 offices in the inner cities ; they are mostly located in suburban areas and only open during work hours			0
an hourly employee would have to jump a bus out to a @entity187 location during lunch hour to get an @entity26			0
we can assume how often that might happen , which is rarely , especially in a state with almost no viable mass transit			0
that 's why generous @entity14 lawmakers funded mobile facilities in 20 counties to help people obtain ids in locations with limited access to state services			1
unfortunately , the @entity221 has only issued about 100 , which has n't made much of a dent in hundreds of thousands of registered voters still lacking legal id to vote			1
and that 's probably what the legislature and the governor of @entity14 wanted to happen			2
no , that is precisely the outcome they desired			0
@entity14 law continues , however , to respect certain population groups			1
in the state @entity239 , if you have a concealed carry handgun permit , your gun and you can move right into the building through the security express lane and avoid inspection			1
that handy little gun card will also get you access to a voting booth , even when a war hero and former @entity246 @entity18 speaker and potential future governors are temporarily denied			1
the kinda , sorta right to vote is still safe in @entity14			1
join us @entity252 / @entity251			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity255 .			2

@entity255 : *ex-speaker* of the @entity18 was n't qualified to vote in home state of @entity14
@entity255 : tough voter id law passed even though voter fraud practically *nonexistent* in @entity14
@entity255 : *hispanics* , women , the poor , rural and urban folks most likely to be turned down
@entity255 : if you have a concealed gun permit , you can walk right through @entity239
