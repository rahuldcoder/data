@entity0 , @entity1 -- when she was 14 years old , @entity3 entered the cow pen behind her home with an elderly woman carrying a rusty knife			1
as a crowd from her @entity10 village looked on , @entity3 sat down , lifted her skirt and opened her legs			1
the woman grabbed @entity3 's most intimate body parts and , in just moments , cut them out			1
" it ( was ) really painful			0
i fainted , " recalled @entity3 , now 34			1
" you 're not supposed to cry			0
" for generations , this ceremony was a rite of passage for every @entity10 girl , some as young as 10 ; soon afterward , they would marry and drop out of school			1
about 140 million girls and women worldwide have been affected by female genital mutilation , also known as female circumcision			2
the procedure is commonly based on religious and cultural beliefs , including efforts to prevent premarital sex and marital infidelity			0
while female circumcision and child marriage are now illegal in @entity1 -- new laws banning genital mutilation have contributed to a decline in the practice -- officials acknowledge that they still go on , especially in rural tribal areas			1
despite free primary education being mandated 10 years ago by the @entity1 government , educating girls is still not a priority for the @entity10 culture			1
according to the @entity1 government , only 11 % of @entity10 girls in @entity1 finish primary school			1
" it means the end of their dreams of whatever they want to become in life , " @entity3 said			1
but when @entity3 endured the painful ritual in 1993 , she had a plan			1
she negotiated a deal with her father , threatening to run away unless he promised she could finish high school after the ceremony			1
" i really liked going to school , " she said			2
" i knew that once i went through the cutting , i was going to be married off			0
and my dream of becoming a teacher was going to end			0
" dreams like @entity3 's were n't the norm in @entity67 , a small village in western @entity1			1
engaged at age 5 , @entity3 spent her childhood learning the skills she would need to be a good @entity10 wife			1
but her mother encouraged her children to strive for a better life , and @entity3 heeded her advice , postponing the coming - of - age ritual as long as she could			1
when her father finally insisted , she took her stand			0
@entity3 's bold move paid off			1
she excelled in high school and earned a college scholarship in the @entity81			2
her community held a fundraiser to raise money for her airfare , and in exchange , she promised to return and help the village			2
over the next decade , @entity3 would earn her degree , a job at the @entity90 and eventually a doctorate in education			1
but she never forgot the vow she made to village elders			2
in 2009 , she opened the first primary school for girls in her village , the @entity98			1
today , @entity3 is helping more than 150 girls receive the education and opportunities that she had to sacrifice so much to attain			1
the @entity98 started as a traditional day school , but now the students , who range from fourth to eighth grade , live at the school			0
this spares the girls from having to walk miles back and forth , which puts them at risk of being sexually assaulted , a common problem in rural @entity112 communities			2
it also ensures the girls do n't spend all their free time doing household chores			0
" now , they can focus on their studies -- and on being kids , " @entity3 said			2
" it 's the only way you can give a girl child a chance to excel			0
" students receive three meals a day as well as uniforms , books and tutoring			0
there are also extracurricular activities such as student council , debate and soccer			0
class sizes are small -- many schools in @entity1 are extremely overcrowded -- and the girls have more chances to participate			1
with these opportunities and the individual attention they receive , the girls are inspired to start dreaming big			0
" they want to become doctors , pilots , lawyers , " @entity3 said			2
" it 's exciting to see that			0
" just 4 years old , the school already ranks among the top in its district			0
" fathers are now saying , ' my daughter could do better than my son , ' " @entity3 said			2
as a public school , the @entity98 receives some financial support from the @entity1 government			1
but the majority of the school 's expenses are paid for by @entity3 's @entity81 - based nonprofit			1
while families are asked to contribute to cover the cost of the girls ' meals , an expense that can be paid in maize or beans , @entity3 covers the costs of any students who can not pay			1
each year , more than 100 girls apply for approximately 30 spots available in each new class			0
parents who enroll their daughters must agree that they will not be subjected to genital mutilation or early marriage			0
many families are willing to accept @entity3 's terms , and that 's the kind of change she was hoping to inspire			1
it took her years to drum up support for the project , but eventually she persuaded the village elders to donate land for the school			2
" it 's still quite challenging to push for change			0
men are in charge of everything , " she said			0
" but nothing good comes on a silver plate			0
you have to fight hard			0
" chief @entity193 , a village elder , can testify firsthand to @entity3 's powers of persuasion			1
as recently as 2006 , he claimed there was no need for girls to be educated			0
but she managed to win him over ; he 's now an important partner in her efforts			0
@entity193 said @entity3 's accomplishments and spirit have made her a role model , noting that villagers also respect the fact that she did n't forget her promise			2
" we have several sons who have gone to the @entity81 for school			0
@entity3 is the only one that i can think of that has come back to help us , " @entity193 said			1
" what she tells us , it touches us			0
... she brought a school and a light and is trying to change old customs to help girls get a new , better life			1
" in 2011 , @entity3 moved to @entity217 , @entity1 's capital , with her husband and two young sons			1
she spends about half her time in @entity67 , where she loves to visit with the girls and see them evolve			0
" when they start , they are so timid , " she said			0
" ( now ) the confidence they have , it 's just beyond words			0
it 's the most beautiful thing			0
" her nonprofit also runs health and leadership camps that are open to all sixth - grade girls in the village and teach them about female circumcision , child marriage , teen pregnancy and hiv / aids			1
" we tell them about every right that they have , and we teach them how to speak up , " @entity3 said			2
" it 's about empowering the girls			0
" in the coming years , @entity3 plans to expand her school to include lower grades			1
she also wants to provide tutoring for the students from her first class when they head to high school next year , and she wants to eventually open a career center for them			2
she hopes that one day the school will serve as a model for girls ' education throughout @entity258			2
ultimately , @entity3 wants girls to have the opportunity to go as far as their abilities will take them			1
" i came back so girls do n't have to negotiate like i did to achieve their dreams , " she said			2
" that 's why i wake up every morning			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity266 website at @entity267 and see how to help .			0

only 11 % of @entity10 girls in @entity1 finish primary school , according to the government
@entity3 is trying to change the culture and empower girls there
