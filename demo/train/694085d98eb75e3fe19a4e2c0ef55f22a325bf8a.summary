in the background , someone can be heard screaming for help , but the caller said she was too afraid to go outside and see what was going on			0
" it 's heart - wrenching , because those actually were my son 's last words , " said @entity3 's father			2
" and to hear his last words being cries of help , is devastating			0
it tears me apart as a father			0
" the state attorney 's office also said a voice analysis would be conducted on 911 calls from the night of the shooting to determine who was yelling for help			0
opinion : my son could be @entity3 @entity4 rep. @entity322 , who was the prime @entity324 sponsor of the deadly force legislation , told @entity210 tuesday that " nothing in ' stand your ground ' authorizes ( you ) to pursue and confront			2
