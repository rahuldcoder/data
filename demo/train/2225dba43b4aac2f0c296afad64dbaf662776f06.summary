@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's eyes light up as the 88 - year - old man talks about his last flight in a @entity7			1
@entity4 , 88 , recently flew on a @entity7 for the first time since @entity9 " we were going to @entity11 , and we were flying around 20,000 feet			1
suddenly , me 109s headed out of the clouds , " said the @entity0 native , referring to @entity15 's @entity14 fighter aircraft			1
" we had a big fight , a running fight , and i personally saw my waist gunner shoot down one of those me 109s right outside the window			2
" seconds later , his bomber was struck in the plane 's radio room			2
@entity4 , who was the radio operator , already had moved farther back in the plane			2
" i was back at the waist gun			2
otherwise , i would n't be here today			2
we were set afire , and i was told to bail out , and i bailed out			0
" the @entity33 , a restored @entity9 - era @entity7 like the one @entity4 flew in , starts a nationwide tour this weekend in @entity0			1
its mission is to remind @entity37 of the sacrifices made by their fathers and grandfathers over the skies of @entity42			0
it 's also sure to spark the memories of servicemen who flew in them			0
@entity4 's plane went down on the outskirts of @entity11 in 1945			0
two of his crew mates never got out of the plane			0
as he tells a small crowd the story at @entity0 's @entity54 , he is overcome with emotion and walks away briefly to gather himself			1
when he returns , @entity4 talks about how he was captured on the ground and spent the next several months as a prisoner of war before @entity37 gen. @entity59 's @entity58 freed him			0
@entity60 is one of two veteran bomber crew members who have been invited out to the airport by the @entity64			1
the foundation is responsible for resurrecting and flying this @entity7 , often referred to as the " @entity7 " because of the 13 machine guns carried aboard the plane			1
of the 12,732 b - 17s built during the war years , only 12 continue to fly			1
" our role is to fly this aircraft as a flying museum , to teach younger people the history of @entity9 , " said @entity70 , a foundation volunteer and part - time pilot of the @entity72			1
" it is in honor of those men and women who fought and died for us			0
and to honor those men who are still living			0
some of them fly on the aircraft with us , and we get to hear their stories of what happened to them during @entity9			1
that 's the icing on the cake			0
" but it 's not just veterans who get to relive the @entity7			0
each weekend , for nine months out of the year , the plane tours the @entity37 , providing an opportunity for young and old to take a 30 - minute flight on the @entity33			1
" it 's a wonderful 30 minutes			1
you get to move to all of the combat positions other than my seat , " said @entity99 , the @entity33 's chief pilot			1
" the best seat in the house is the bombardier seat in the front			0
it 's a great experience			0
" but this " experience " does n't come cheap			0
it costs $ 430 for nonmembers of the foundation to fly a mission			1
@entity99 said the money allows the group to keep the plane airborne			0
" about half that is to break even just to fly the plane			2
the rest goes to operating costs			0
" the fuel costs are the weekend 's single largest expenditure			2
it costs roughly $ 91,000 to fill the tank , and the four engines burn 200 gallons of fuel an hour			0
" there are a lot of forces trying to put these things in a museum , " @entity99 said			2
" we want to keep these things flying for the public			1
it 's strictly based on public donations , and we hope to keep it flying for years			1
" the @entity33 was built in 1945 but never saw combat			1
no longer needed , the plane was sold for scrap before being passed around to several entities before the @entity64 bought it in 2000 and restored it			1
@entity64 founder @entity141 then had it painted as the " @entity33 " to honor his father who flew on the original @entity72 in the @entity143 during the war			1
@entity99 , who is a @entity145 pilot when he is not flying the @entity72 , said it 's important to remember the high casualties @entity7 crews suffered during @entity9 " it 's just staggering to think about , " he said of the more than 45,000 @entity7 crewmen killed or wounded during the war years			1
" but we tell everybody never pass up an opportunity to tell these guys thank you			0
" @entity158 , 84 , ca n't say how many missions he flew			2
the former bombardier remembers at least 30			2
" i was just busy and did n't keep up with it , " he said			0
" somebody asked me if i ever got shot at , " @entity158 said , recalling , " yes , every mission and you were scared			0
" he said he 's grateful for what the @entity64 is doing			1
" of course it means a lot to me			0
... thousands [ of b - 17s } were just destroyed , " he said			2
@entity4 said he 's also appreciative			0
@entity4 ended his first flight aboard a @entity7 since his fateful leap in 1945 , gingerly climbing out through the fuselage hatch to show his fellow passengers how he escaped			0
his smile reveals that at least this day , the @entity33 's mission has been a success .			1
