@entity0 -- well , that turned ugly fast			1
a move that the @entity4 hoped might herald a happy welcome home for @entity7 sgt. @entity6 , a soldier held captive for five years by the @entity9 in @entity10 , quickly turned into a nasty and largely partisan fight when he was exchanged for five militants being held in @entity13			1
a political tsunami ensued with allegations from both sides of the aisle of politicizing national security , questions about whether @entity6 is a deserter and criticism of his family			2
" i 'm never surprised by controversies that are whipped up in @entity0			2
that 's par for the course , " president @entity23 said thursday during a news conference at a meeting of @entity27 leaders in @entity28			2
but the force of the vitriol , backlash and backpedaling is an example of how sensitive issues can quickly turn volatile in a hyper - partisan @entity0 climate , political analysts said			1
" when , all of a sudden , you 've got @entity41 congressman who previously were calling for this , criticizing the administration for leaving this man in captivity for five years , or praising his release , and then deleting those tweets ? that really belies the politics			0
that exposes the naked , ugly politics behind this controversy , " said @entity50 , a @entity1 political analyst			0
politics , raw and unpleasant , is what defines @entity0 now , political analysts said			2
" it 's to be expected because it 's a potent mix of partisan environment where the rhetoric is very heated , " said @entity58 , a @entity59 historian and @entity1 contributor			1
" combine that with a very controversial decision			0
put those things together and you expect this kind of thing to happen			0
" however , it 's important to wade through the rhetoric and get to the issues at the core , said @entity74 , editor of @entity75			2
behind the " the arm - waving and typical @entity79 vs. @entity4 gamesmanship , " there are pertinent questions about why the administration did n't tell @entity82 about the prisoner swap plan , if such a trade was a good one and whether the @entity4 should have struck a more solemn tone about @entity6 's release when there were questions about desertion , @entity74 said			1
" the @entity6 situation has produced exactly the same kind of whirlwind of invective and overheated , highly politicized commentary that just about everything else does in @entity0 , " @entity74 said			1
" the trick in this case , as in all others , is to somehow discount all that and get to the underlying truth			0
real issues regularly get obscured by all the invective and defensive spin			0
" and everyone involved is in heavy " defensive " spin mode			0
who was swapped for @entity6 ? i was for it before i was against it former @entity112 prisoner of war and 2008 @entity41 presidential nominee sen. @entity113 , criticized the trade of @entity6 for the @entity9 commanders quickly			1
" this decision to bring sergeant @entity6 home , and we applaud that he 's home -- it 's ill - founded , it 's a mistake and it 's putting lives of @entity125 servicemen and women at risk , " the @entity116 @entity41 told reporters			1
however , in february , @entity113 seemed in an interview with @entity1 to back a swap			0
" obviously , i 'd have to know the details , but i would support ways of bringing him home and if ( an ) exchange was one of them , i think that would be something i think we should seriously consider , " he said at the time			0
@entity113 has said his message has been consistent			0
then there are lawmakers who deleted their initial " welcome home " tweets to @entity6 as the controversy over his release spiraled into ugliness			1
democrats , including the president , senate majority leader @entity148 and @entity4 minority leader @entity149 , said @entity6 is being used as a political football			2
" if @entity23 cured cancer , @entity41 would attack him for putting oncologists out of work , " @entity146 strategist @entity151 told @entity1			0
but even some @entity146 , such as @entity156 chairman @entity155 , criticized the administration 's end run around @entity82 in securing @entity6 's release but defended the decision			1
confusing messages from the @entity4 the @entity4 story on when and how top leaders on @entity79 were informed about the release has added to the confusion , political analysts said			0
the initial @entity168 announcement was quickly followed by apologies to such top democrats as @entity155 for being kept out of the loop			0
then came more explanation about the critical timing of @entity6 's release , which the administration has said was tied to his declining health and the pending withdrawal of @entity125 combat troops from @entity10			1
@entity178 wanted tougher deal for @entity6 meanwhile , the criticism outside of @entity0 has grown louder and less polite			1
a group of soldiers from @entity6 's unit in @entity10 accused him of desertion			1
their claims -- not confirmed by the @entity186 , which is investigating -- responded to how @entity6 was lauded by the @entity4 as a hero when there were questions about his disappearance			2
those soldiers said several troops were killed in efforts to find him , another claim the military has not confirmed			0
@entity41 strategist , @entity196 , who @entity197 reported helped get the soldiers ' side of the story out to such media outlets as the @entity202 , worked on former @entity205 gov. @entity204 's 2012 presidential campaign			0
@entity196 declined to comment on his efforts to @entity1			0
in the meantime , the rancor has even begun to impact @entity6 's family and community			1
@entity212 host @entity211 said @entity6 's father , who wears a long beard , " looks like a @entity213 , " and their hometown of @entity218 , @entity219 , called off a welcome home rally after fears of backlash over the controversial nature of the soldier 's release			1
" emotions are running very high on this case , " said @entity1 senior political analyst @entity226			0
" among the military personnel and veterans , my sense is it has less to do with the trade for the five militants than the celebratory qualities that the administration initially displayed toward @entity6			1
the message they got was this was a hero coming home			0
and that totally misreads the military mentality on this issue			2
" celebrated at first , @entity6 's release raises questions how big a terror risk are former @entity13 prisoners ? @entity6 ' life ' video shown , senators still skeptical @entity1 senior white house correspondent @entity251 contributed to this report .			1

rhetoric over @entity7 sgt. @entity6 's release has turned rancorous
partisan fight over the controversial deal is another example of @entity0 *infighting*
supporters and *opponents* of the prisoner swap have both been *inconsistent* on the issue
the narrative of @entity6 's release is an especially thorny issue for *members* of the military
