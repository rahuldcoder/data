i grew up in a @entity2 suburb called @entity3			0
actually when my parents — @entity2 natives — first moved there in the late 1970s , it barely qualified as a suburb ; cornfields and dairy farms still filled the open land around the quaint @entity13 town center			0
it was , i recognize now , a lovely place to be a kid , if incredibly boring during the actual process of growing up			0
but even then i knew it was one thing : safe			0
there was little violent crime to speak of , especially compared with the crumbling city my parents had left			2
blood - soaked local newscasts during the 1980s made it seem as if murder were @entity2 's no. 1 product — and the @entity2 , where homicides peaked at 503 in 1990 , was hardly alone in being seen by @entity26 as fundamentally unsafe			1
it was the underlying message of nearly every tv cop show and film thriller made through the 1980s and ' 90s : the city is dangerous , and you 're lucky to get out alive			2
many of @entity35 's cities have become much safer in the years since , for reasons that range from better policing to the slowdown of the crack epidemic of the 1980s to the removal of lead from the environment			2
even in @entity2 , where the economy is still struggling and population has never recovered from the urban flight of the 1970s and ' 80s , there were 329 murders in 2012 , down significantly from the worst years a couple of decades ago			2
other cities have experienced even more astounding turnarounds : in @entity51 , where i live now , there were just 414 homicides in a city of 8.2 million , the lowest number in more than half a century			0
but those statistics are n't convincing the country that cities are getting safer : a 2011 @entity60 poll found that most @entity26 continue to believe that the nation 's crime rate is getting worse , even though there 's been a sharp and sustained drop in murders and other violent assaults since the mid- 1990s			1
perception — no doubt fueled in part by the media — beats reality			0
but even with crime down , surely it 's still safer to live in the quiet countryside than it is in the city ? it turns out that 's not true			1
according to a new study ( @entity81 ) published today in the @entity82 , large cities in the @entity26 are significantly safer than rural areas			1
the risk of injury death — which counts both violent crime and accidents — is more than 20 % higher in the countryside than it is in large urban areas			1
" perceptions have long existed that cities were innately more dangerous than areas outside of cities , but our study shows this is not the case , " said the lead author , dr. @entity98 of the @entity99 and the @entity100 in a statement			0
far from being violent death traps , a large city might just about be the safest place to live in the @entity26			1
@entity105 : get the lead out of poor countries now it 's true that the risk of homicide is greater in big cities than it is in the countryside			1
but the study , which analyzed 1,295,919 deaths from injury between 1999 and 2006 , found the rate of dying from an unintentional injury is over 15 times higher than that of homicide for the population as a whole			1
whether you live in rural areas or the city , you 're much less likely to die from a gunshot wound — either from someone else or self - inflicted — than you are in a simple accident			1
especially car crashes , which make up the bulk of unintentional injury deaths — motor - vehicle - injury - related deaths occurred at a rate that is more than 1.4 times higher than the next leading cause of death			1
the study does n't attempt to explain why injury death is more common in rural areas than large urban ones , but some of the statistics are telling			1
the risk of firearm - related death showed no difference across the rural - urban spectrum for the population as a whole , but varied when divided up by age — firearm deaths were significantly higher for children and people ages 45 and older , while for people ages 20 to 44 , the risk of firearm deaths were much higher in urban areas			1
i 'd wager some of that comes down to differences in gun ownership : more households have firearms in rural areas than in urban ones , and sadly , too many gun owners keep their firearms where their children can reach them			2
the result can be tragic			0
at the same time , the bulk of victims killed by homicide are young men , according to @entity170 statistics			0
and they are more likely to be shot and killed in the cities			0
@entity105 : ranking @entity35 's greenest cities but guns — whether used accidentally or with intent — are much less likely to be the cause of death than another tool : cars			2
and people drive more , drive longer , drive faster and drive drunker in rural areas than in urban ones , where they can walk or take public transit			2
motor - vehicle crashes led to 27.61 deaths per 100,000 people in most rural areas , and just 10.58 deaths per 100,000 people			0
those are stark statistics , and they do n't even take into account the cardiovascular benefits that may accrue to urbanites who spend more time walking than riding in cars			0
it 's not for nothing that @entity51 , who live in the densest urban area in the @entity26 , live about 2.2 years longer than the national average			1
of course , not all cities are equally safe — @entity203 has seen a terrifying rise in gun deaths in recent years , and there 's nothing safe about a bankrupt and broken city like @entity209 , where it can take 58 minutes on average for police to answer a 911 call			0
( even there most urban areas have an advantage , though — you 're likely to be much closer to the nearest hospital in a dense city than the spread - out countryside , and minutes matter when it comes to trauma			1
) but the numbers do n't lie — as scary as we may think urban crime is , the threats that are prevalent in rural areas are statistically more dangerous			1
we already know that the best way to shrink your carbon footprint is to move to a dense city			0
now it turns out that it might be the best way to stay alive too			0
