@entity0 -- @entity1 is widely credited with helping transform a stodgy old leather goods company into a fashion icon			1
coach was founded in @entity6 in 1941 , an old - world firm cranking out hard leather brief cases			1
but it was n't until a major overhaul in the 1990 's that the company caught the eyes of the fashion world , introducing so - called " affordable luxury "			1
@entity1 , ceo , coach			1
since then , @entity1 has expanded the brand from trendy hand bags to gloves , and other accessories , bringing his by - the - numbers management style to the fickle world of fashion			1
@entity0 's @entity23 interviewed @entity1 and started by asking him what had prepared him for a life in the fashion world and how much he cared about clothes and trends in his youth			1
@entity30 : when i was young i did n't have the slightest clue about brands			0
i actually was more interested in the social movements of the 1960 's , the civil rights movement , the anti-war movement and found myself in government actually for ten years after college before i came to @entity15			1
@entity39 : so , how did you make the transition to the world of fashion ? @entity30 : what i joined was really just a manufacturer of leather products			2
over the years , we migrated to become a modern lifestyle fashion accessories brand and i guess i just learned along the way			0
@entity39 : how do you stay on top in a very fickle world of fashion because that 's what you 're dealing with now ? @entity30 : one of the ways we think at @entity15 is as a company that is run as a blend of logic and magic			1
magic is the touch and feel and instinct of good product , good looking product , of understanding trends , and logic is using all of the knowledge that is available to you , so you can really understand where consumers are today and where they 're going tomorrow			0
so , for example , we do a considerable amount of quantitative research , measuring attitudes and trends in the marketplace , purchase satisfaction and satisfaction with our visits			0
@entity39 : some people said that you have democratized luxury , made it accessible to more people			2
is that how you see it ? @entity30 : we actually see coach as an egalitarian brand			0
@entity92 is really a melting pot of the world and we do n't have a class system in @entity92			0
anyone can be anything in @entity92			0
@entity39 : is there a risk by making your products very accessible that somehow you cheapen them ? i mean if everybody has it , what 's so special about it ? @entity30 : some consumers perceive us as the penultimate luxury and other consumers step down to buy a coach			1
we like it that way , and we like to have a broad array of price points that can appeal to an aspirational consumer who can just enter the world of @entity15 with a small accessory for as little as $ 28 , or to the aficionado we offer $ 10,000 exotic handbags			2
@entity39 : do you think that recipe can work globally ? @entity30 : it is working globally			2
we are very successful in @entity125 , in @entity126 , and emerging markets such as @entity128 and @entity129 and in developing countries			0
we 're a very desirable alternative to the @entity133 luxury brands because our price points are less than half of their price points ; yet , the materials are the very same materials that go into their products and ours are at least as well - made			2
@entity39 : what do you worry about ? what keeps you up at night ? @entity30 : honestly , everything keeps me up at night , but i think i am primarily a serial worrier			0
i worry about the current situation and more often than not now it 's about people , it 's about the next generation in leadership , it 's about how i can fill organizational voids			0
