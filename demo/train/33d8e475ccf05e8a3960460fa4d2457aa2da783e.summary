@entity0 -- after two nail - biting periods , the @entity2 and @entity0 remained tied 0 - 0 in game 4 of the @entity6 finals wednesday			1
@entity2 goaltender @entity7 and @entity0 goalie @entity8 seemingly put up walls in front of their nets in a defensive struggle			1
among the celebrities in attendance were longtime @entity0 fans @entity17 and @entity18 , along with @entity19 , who made a raucous video cheering the @entity0 that went viral throughout now - hockey - crazy @entity0			1
@entity0 fans , most dressed in their home team 's black , roared throughout the contest and chanted " mvp " each time @entity8 stopped a serious scoring chance by the @entity2			1
from the start , the @entity0 seemed doomed to be underdogs			2
they are a hockey team in a land without snow or even ice			1
they could n't even find a puck for their first practice in 1967			0
not even the @entity37 , @entity37 , could bring the team a @entity6			0
and to marginalize them further , the @entity0 had to compete for fans against other local teams , some legendary : the @entity41 , the @entity42 , the @entity43 and the @entity44			2
but the @entity0 are positioned to win their first @entity6 in the franchise 's 44 - year history , and they could do it in grand fashion by sweeping the devils in game 4 of the best - of - seven championship series			1
the @entity0 have been having a @entity53 run , entering the playoffs as the lowest seed in their conference			1
but they have been nearly unbeatable , with a 15 - 2 playoff record			0
in his 39th season as the announcer for @entity0 games , @entity60 @entity59 said the anticipation was unbearable			2
" it is emotional for me , and i 'm wondering what it 's gon na be like when it actually happens and i see ( team captain ) @entity72 lift that @entity6 , because there were years that a lot of us in the organization felt , ' will we ever see this ? ' " @entity59 said			2
at their first practice in 1967 , after the league awarded a franchise to @entity0 , the team 's pucks were " stored under boxes and equipment , and they had no puck , " @entity59 said			1
making sense of the @entity0 a @entity89 producer borrowed a puck that had been a gift from the @entity91 and gave it to the team , @entity59 said			1
" they 've come a long way since the days of one puck , that 's for sure , " @entity59 said			0
the @entity97 in downtown @entity0 , home of the @entity0 , is seeing a run on team apparel			1
it 's an unlikely scenario because the arena usually sports the colors and merchandise of the @entity41 and @entity44 , the @entity105 teams that both call it home			0
" i 'm so fired up right now that i got up this morning , put shoes on and came down here to get this jersey			0
i had a t - shirt			0
i said , ' i need a jersey to keep me for real , be there for them			0
let 's be there when they end it ! ' " fan @entity116 said			0
" that 's gon na be wednesday night ! @entity0 goin ' to go all the way ! " inside the stadium , fans were anxious			1
" i 've been a @entity0 fan for 40 years and had a season 's seat for 25 years , " said @entity125 , holding a plastic cup of white wine			1
" i 've waited a long time for this , so it 's chardonnay now , and i hope it 's champagne later			0
" grabbing a beer at a concession stand , @entity133 said he was glad to see the @entity0 as the successful ones this time of year now that the @entity41 and @entity44 have been eliminated from the playoffs			1
" it 's just great to see the focus on the @entity0 now instead of those other teams , " @entity133 said			2
two other fans drove in from @entity141 , five hours away			0
" they underachieved all season , and so i think that now they are actually living up to their potential and showing everybody that they really were the team to beat , " said @entity142 , who was joined by her friend , @entity144			0
kings have found a way to be better actor and rapper @entity154 , more of a basketball fanatic , has even caught the fever , he said			0
" normally during this time of year , i 'm watching the @entity105 playoffs , but a friend of mine invited me to the hockey game , and i decided to take him up on his offer , and i got ta tell you , it did not disappoint , " he said			2
" you know , the hockey games live , the hockey match live , is some serious business			0
