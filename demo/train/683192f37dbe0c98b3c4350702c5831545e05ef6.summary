show us how you celebrate @entity2 in your part of the world -- blame it on my childhood			1
during the 1970s in suburban @entity9 , @entity10 , it was long my mother 's ambition to grace our brick @entity13 with hush - inducing purity			2
she thought that by putting a single candle in each of the windows at @entity2 , our house would be the envy of the neighborhood — a magical locus of holiday coziness and kinship , the visual equivalent of nutmeg			1
what transpired , though , out of inertia and a fear of flames , was a different matter altogether			2
she bought only two candles , both electric , which were put in two ground - floor windows			2
their streaky , uncertain light took the form of two vertical smears on either side of our front door ; it looked like our house was crying			1
the following week , my mother and i drove by a neighbor 's extravagantly decorated home — gobs of colorful , twinkly bulbs swathing house and shrubbery ; a sleigh ; windows caked with aerosol snow			2
@entity53 : " we 're gon na need more candles			2
" we never got those candles , and so my interest in this garish form of beauty is born of deprivation			2
@entity61 turns awesome and hokey , @entity2 lights reflect man 's struggle to create something as beautiful as dusk or dawn ; they 're fireworks in suspended animation			1
their earliest historical antecedent is probably the pagan @entity70 log of northern @entity71 , which burned for many days during the dark winter solstice , thus rendering it a symbol of hope			2
@entity76 : @entity78 's prettiest winter towns but if the contemporary iterations of this symbol are any guide — so often does a @entity79 of man - made twinkle reveal a rat 's maze of black electrical cable — then the current byword would seem to be less hope and more @entity91 's worst nightmare			2
indeed — whether in @entity9 or @entity92 or @entity93 or @entity94 , @entity95 — christmas lights have the curious ability simultaneously to slightly repel us and to put us at ease			1
at first blush we think , " @entity101 , what is this wanton , throbbing blight on the landscape , and what is its potential damage to the world 's energy resources ? " but upon further reflection we decide , " let 's find a parking space , shall we ? " @entity122 , the @entity112 , in @entity113 , @entity114 , where 3.6 million lights annually shed their buxom charms on 400 - plus animated figures , horse - drawn - carriage rides , @entity119 , fireworks , and live reindeer ! @entity122 , the light - bedecked @entity123 , in @entity124 , just 85 miles north of the equator , where children have been known to throw " snowballs " created by a foam - making machine at a shopping center lined with luxury boutiques ! @entity122 , the @entity131 family of @entity132 , @entity114 's @entity133 , with seven miles of cable , more than 150,000 led lights , and narration over a short - range radio station called the @entity138 from a former @entity140 announcer ! @entity76 : the world 's most traditional holiday foods christmas lights are a civic obligation			1
they 're a form of advertising			0
they 're a gateway drug for other holiday dysfunction			0
whatever their particular function — and regardless of whether they 're hung by cities or their residents — all these twinkling bulbs help broaden the definition of @entity2			1
sure , everyone knows that an elegant wreath of holly , when secured to a mantel or antique wooden door , can distill end - of - year cheer faster than you can say " @entity164 , " or how stumbling upon pine boughs that are maypoled up a shepherd 's - crook streetlight can suddenly transform you into a ruddy - cheeked @entity169 character with a name like mrs. @entity171			0
but what of the giant , green fluorescent clam whose @entity119 hat of twinkly lights looks like a strange , predatory apostrophe ? what of the scrum of light - saddled fiberglass elves that have been cunningly gathered around a city hall 's drainpipe ? these , too , are @entity2 , my friend			1
and these , too , have their charms			0
for those of us who enjoy @entity2 - light viewing as a spectator sport , it 's the regional or location - specific twists that linger long in the mind			1
when a standard - bearer like @entity197 's @entity196 trots out its towering tree , or @entity199 strings up its giant , globular , all - white chandeliers of lights that lead up to @entity203 , both efforts yield a generalized @entity2 ideal that could be happening anywhere in the world			1
but you know you 're in @entity209 , @entity210 , when you see lights that portray how @entity119 hooked a marlin while trolling from his charter boat , the @entity215			1
you know you 're in @entity217 , @entity218 , when 1.8 million lights on 200 trees and 20 bridges illuminate flesh - and - blood carolers who warble from the decks of passing river barges			1
or maybe the absence of lights is a clue to your location : consider the @entity230 restaurant in @entity231 that has covered its tree not with radiant bulbs but with chili peppers			1
or maybe , best / worst case scenario , the concept of location itself is altogether a moot point			0
think of the swirling cloud of cultural dissonance you 'd witness if you traveled to @entity92 's @entity243 to look at the lights strung on the park 's @entity246 pagoda			1
for the full effect , you 'll probably want to wear a guayabera and recite from the @entity250			0
@entity76 : @entity78 's best hot chocolate i also welcome a tiny amount of emperilment to my viewing ; a whiff of danger can be a valuable component in the one - two punch of repulsion and ease			0
" due to high electrical voltage , please do not enter the show area or yard for any reason ! failure to observe this rule could result in serious injury or death " : this is a warning not for a downtown area or a rodeo , but rather for a private home ( belonging to the aforementioned @entity131 family of @entity132 )			1
suddenly the stakes are raised			0
suddenly i 'm on board			0
indeed , there have been instances where i 've walked toward some of these twitching , thrumming displays — and suddenly feared that these giant spiderwebs of pulsing electricity are bug zappers , but for people			1
it 's all too easy to imagine how my body would ricochet from bulb to bulb , emitting a scarifying screech of smoke and crackle , whereupon i 'd crash to the floor , a human crouton			0
so often do lighting displays ' rickety natures or excessiveness lead to anxiety that it takes no effort to misread a haphazardly copyedited 1995 article from the @entity298			2
visitors to @entity302 's @entity301 , the article claimed , would encounter " a playground area decorated with lighted reindeer			0
" @entity305 , @entity306 ! a brush with danger , followed by a sense of relief : looking at @entity2 lights is a slap and then a kiss			1
i remember sitting in a café in the @entity315 , in @entity316 , some years ago , half of my then - boyfriend @entity319 's face illuminated by a fiery crimson glow from a string of @entity2 lights hanging on the building 's front			1
the slash of red slicing across his face gave him the look of an angry elf or of the " before and after " picture in an infomercial for satanic rituals			0
i could n't reconcile the shaky , blood - evocative light with @entity319 's button - down temperament and oxford shirt , nor with the magisterial , late - evening hush of the piazza and its dusty stone monuments			2
but then i looked across the square at the centuries - old @entity341 and thought of ancient @entity316			0
i thought , @entity342 , pillaging , vino			0
i thought , @entity345 , bonfires			0
just then , it all came together for me			0
and what of my mother and @entity2 ? the electric candles have long since been lost			1
a few years back , @entity53 moved to a retirement community in @entity351 , @entity352 , whose gift shop she manages			0
she recently told me , " last year i hung all my @entity2 lights and swags in the shop			1
but afterward i was too lazy to put them away in boxes , so they 're all in my bathtub now			0
" this month , these bulbs and boughs and wreaths will decorate the gift shop again , but @entity53 and i will be in @entity365			0
we 're excited about the prospect of @entity369 holiday excess , and we 're fairly certain the island will cough up some high - level twinkle			1
i told @entity53 that last year 's festivities there included a @entity374 , a lighted boat parade , a vodka - company - sponsored tour of decorated @entity378 guesthouses , and an underwater light display			2
she weighed in with , " their decorating committee is very active			0
" @entity2 will once more shine @entity382 - bright			1
there will definitely be enough candles			0
planning a getaway ? do n't miss @entity76 's guide to the @entity388 's @entity387 copyright 2012 @entity389			0

@entity2 light displays , in their excess , are simultaneously tacky and charming
these *modern* , twinkling lights *expand* the meaning of @entity2 around the world
warnings of high voltage make @entity2 light spectating more exciting
