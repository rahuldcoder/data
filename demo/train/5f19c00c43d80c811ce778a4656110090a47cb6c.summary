@entity0 -- a jury began deliberating wednesday afternoon in actress @entity4 's wrongful termination lawsuit against " @entity6 " creator @entity5			1
the jury of nine women and three men is to decide whether @entity5 killed off a @entity4 's character in retaliation for the actress complaining that he hit her during a rehearsal for the @entity14 comedy			1
a verdict requires the agreement of nine jurors			0
@entity4 is asking for $ 5.7 million in damages from @entity14 and @entity5 , although the actress was paid $ 4 million in her last year of work and is still earning royalties from her vested interest in the hit series			1
@entity4 lawyer @entity25 , in his closing wednesday morning , told jurors they have two questions to answer : did @entity5 hit @entity4 on the head on september 24 , 2008 , or was it a " light tap , " as the defense claims ? and , did @entity5 get @entity14 's approval to kill @entity4 's character in may 2008 , as the defense claims , or was the decision made in december , after a human resources investigator cleared him in the slapping incident ? @entity25 called @entity5 a " really obvious liar " who was covering up the real reason he killed off @entity39 , the sassy blonde character @entity4 played for the show 's first five seasons			1
he accused other @entity14 employees of conspiring to cover up evidence that it was a revenge firing in order to protect a show that has earned over $ 1 billion in eight seasons			2
@entity5 and @entity14 claim they decided @entity39 would die in season five in may 2008 , four months before the incident in which @entity5 allegedly struck @entity4			1
@entity25 told jurors that there were " no notes , no calendar , no documents , " supporting that claim , except for a writer assistant 's notes that he accused the defense of fabricating and backdating			2
@entity5 and @entity14 executives testified they did not write e-mails because they wanted to keep the decision a secret			2
" it 's not a ' @entity66 how are we going to kill @entity68 ' decision , " @entity25 told jurors , questioning the need for such secrecy			0
defense lawyer @entity70 , in his closing , said the plaintiffs were asking jurors to accept a " complicated story of conspiracy , " while the reality is much simpler			0
" mr. @entity5 wanted to kill @entity39 for creative reasons , " to shock and surprise viewers and boost ratings , he said			1
" ' @entity6 ' is claiming that 10 good citizens of @entity83 conspired to get their stories straight and then took the stand , looked you in the eyes and lied , " @entity70 said , noting that five of the 10 defense witnesses had " no incentive to lie " since they are no longer associated with @entity14 or the show			2
former @entity14 studio chief @entity88 , who now works for the rival @entity90 network , testified that in may 2008 he approved @entity39 's killing since the character " had run its creative course , " he said			1
former @entity14 network chief @entity94 , who no longer works in the entertainment industry , told jurors that he also approved the decision in may 2008 , @entity70 said			2
@entity70 also pointed to three former show writers who each testified of hearing the plan to kill off @entity39 in writer meetings in may and june 2008			0
one former show writer called as a witness by @entity4 's lawyer testified that she did not hear about the plan until later in the year , after the hitting incident			1
on tuesday , the show 's set construction coordinator testified that he received an e-mail that suggested a " conspiracy to cover up " information regarding @entity4 's lawsuit			1
@entity112 , who has supervised construction of the show 's sets since it began eight years ago , told jurors that he called @entity25 on sunday to alert him to his suspicions of a cover - up conspiracy because what he read in an e-mail " started gnawing at me " and he " began to lose sleep			0
" " it was my understanding that they were going to delete e-mails from the hard drives , " @entity112 said about the e-mail he received in fall 2010 , soon after @entity4 filed her lawsuit			0
he read the e-mail and immediately deleted it because he believed it was not intended for him , he said			0
" i honestly tried to put it out of my mind , " he said , until this past weekend as he realized the @entity0 trial was nearing an end			0
what he read made him uncomfortable " because if the proposed actions were carried out , i felt it would create an imbalance between the parties in this case , " he testified			0
" i just wanted to make it equal for both sides , " he said			0
@entity112 said he feared he was committing " professional suicide " by revealing the e-mail , possibly ending any chances of a future job with @entity14 or its parent company , @entity145			0
he was concerned " not just for me , but for my crew and the well - being of their families , " he said			0
but if he had not come forward , he " would 've had to live with that doubt the rest of my life , " he said			0
under cross-examination by @entity5 's lawyer , @entity112 said @entity4 's lawyer suggested he could help him find a job if @entity14 fired him			1
@entity25 denied that outside the courtroom			0
the defense later called @entity160 , @entity14 's chief litigation lawyer , to testify that she sent memos to every employee connected to the case instructing them to save all their electronic documents			2
asked if she asked anyone to delete e-mails , she said , " absolutely not			0
" the defense won one victory tuesday when the judge issued a directed verdict dismissing @entity4 's battery claim against @entity5			1
@entity4 's lawyer downplayed the significance of that decision , saying the damages could have only been $ 1 and jury deliberations will be simplified without it			1
" you hit me , i complained and you fired me for it , " @entity25 said , giving a thumbnail description of @entity4 's case			1
the hit during a rehearsal was just " a light tap on the head " intended to demonstrate " a piece of physical humor " @entity5 wanted @entity4 to perform , the defense said in opening statements			2
@entity4 testified that @entity5 hit her because he was frustrated during a discussion over her lines in a scene			2
" it was a nice wallop to my head " she said			0
five months and 11 episodes later , @entity5 informed @entity4 that @entity39 would die during a show taping the next day , ending her five - year run on " @entity6			1
" jurors must decide if the death of @entity4 's character and the end of her employment was illegal workplace retaliation or just a creative decision unconnected to the alleged battery incident			1
@entity206 is a defendant in the lawsuit because its executives allegedly failed to properly investigate @entity4 's accusation that @entity5 hit her , and then agreed with his decision to fire her .			1
