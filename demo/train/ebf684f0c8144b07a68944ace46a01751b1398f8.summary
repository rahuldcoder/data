, this is less of a criticism and more a statement of fact			0
bringing glitz to the game , @entity5 is the man behind cricket 's @entity17 revolution			1
" i am ruthless , without doubt , " he told @entity0 's @entity19 in @entity20			0
" otherwise we would n't get where we were			0
" many believe that @entity5 , 44 , has taken cricket into a new era , turning a sport that can be baffling to watch and take five days to play , into a brightly - colored instant hit of action taking just a few hours			1
with cheerleaders , the best players in the world and even @entity33 stars as part owners of some of the teams , @entity5 has concocted a recipe fit for prime - time tv consumption , in a country renown for its passion for the game			1
@entity5 's came up with the idea of a new @entity45 came 14 years ago , but resisted the involvement of the @entity47 at that time , citing too many vested interested within @entity49 's main cricketing body that would have spoiled his ideas			1

after graduating from @entity53 in the @entity54 in sports management he returned to @entity49 to launch @entity56 and 10 sports			0
coming from a family that controls @entity60 , an industrial conglomerate worth $ 1.5 billion , @entity5 admits his family were concerned that he was moving away from business and spending so much time with cricket while setting up the @entity6			1

it 's a nonprofit - making organization and we do this for development of the game and i 'm passionate about the game			2
" however as vice-president of the @entity9 he has been instrumental in boosting its revenues , brokering television deals and sponsorship associations that could see it top the $ 1 billion mark in the next five years			0
