@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 supporters have a plan			1
as they doggedly work the @entity7 system from the ground up , electing more of their team as delegates to the @entity12 , they have a heavyweight plan that 's markedly different from the rumors of convention subterfuge and the guess of simply getting their candidate to the podium			1
" we want to change the @entity7 , " said @entity20 , the @entity1 state director for the @entity4			1
" we are making sure our people get in positions of leadership -- in the nation , in their state , in their county and city , all the way down to the grass roots level			2
" libertarians such as @entity32 aspire to nothing less than the kind of bottom - to - top takeover that proved so successful for the religious right and anti-abortion forces in the 1980s			1
many of the men and women who swept into local party office then inhabit top rungs of the @entity7 now			1
and similar to that movement , @entity4 and his campaigners for liberty are looking down the road			1
" this is not just for this term , " @entity20 told @entity2 from the southern end of the state , " but four , six or eight years from now			2
" nearly 200 miles away , in northern @entity1 , a separate @entity4 supporter is similarly forward looking			1
" four years , eight years , 12 years , we are here for the long haul , " said @entity51 , a 26 - year - old who moved from @entity52 to @entity53 specifically to get involved in electoral politics			0
he plunged in on saturday as one of three @entity4 supporters running for delegate to the national convention from @entity1 's @entity62			1
battle in the grass roots that kind of local party election is often ignored by headlines and pundits , but it 's where @entity69 are waging their most furious battle			1
primaries and caucuses often dictate how a state 's delegates should vote , but it is these internal state and local party conventions that determine who the individual delegates will be			1
they represent hundreds of small but open doors to get your troops to the convention			0
the 8th district , which includes the @entity53 suburbs of @entity86 and @entity0 , felt the @entity4 surge saturday			1
four years ago , the district convention saw some 350 participants			0
the 8th district @entity7 chairman told @entity2 that participation had nearly doubled this year			2
anyone can attend and vote , as long as they sign up by a deadline and have not voted in a @entity97 primary in the past five years			0
this is how the @entity4 strategy works : sign up			2
" we have been calling and e-mailing , " @entity51 said ahead of the vote			0
" our turnout 's looking great			0
" but some feel it is an attempt at political hijacking			0
" there are people out here who are still fighting for @entity4 who got defeated at our primary , " said @entity106 , who has been involved in the 8th @entity107 for 40 years			2
" it 's so ridiculous			0
they should either be a @entity7 or not be here today			2
" asked what she thought the @entity4 supporters were trying to accomplish , @entity106 replied , " i think they are n't really thinking it through			1
i suppose they think we 're people who do n't have an agenda or something			0
" indeed , the agenda is the rallying cry for the libertarian forces			0
@entity2 spoke with more than two dozen @entity4 supporters at this local @entity7 meeting and they shared common goals : substantially smaller government both in spending and in power , far more limits on the @entity133 , an end to what they see as @entity137 interventionist policy overseas and a cry of concern for individual rights			1
the second - ballot gambit " this is a movement , " said @entity142 , who came to the 8th @entity62 convention with his high school friends , " ( @entity7 ) need a true philosophy			1
" they need to bring in more minorities and young people like his group , he added			0
so it 's a movement			0
why then all the national convention delegates ? especially in a place like @entity1 where , by @entity7 rules , nearly all the elected delegates must vote for @entity156 on the first ballot			2
let 's get the nomination theory out of the way			0
one supporter at the 8th district convention mentioned a much - forwarded idea that @entity4 delegates could abstain on the first ballot , forcing a second vote at the convention and then , on that second ballot , cast votes for @entity4			1
but there are two problems with this notion : one is that if a delegate abstains , an alternate delegate , who may or may not be a @entity4 supporter , would step in			2
the other problem ? many @entity4 supporters told @entity2 they think it 's a pipe dream			1
they 're distancing themselves from the idea			0
" to me personally , it does n't look like any way that 's going to happen , " said @entity51 , the candidate trying to get to @entity180			0
" i do n't see ( the @entity4 delegates ) going in and causing a ruckus			2
the last thing we need is to become a scapegoat ( if @entity7 do n't win in november )			2
" change the party from the bottom up @entity4 says as much himself			1
he told @entity2 last week that the idea of disrupting the national convention " is not in my plan			0
that is against my plan			0
" the plan , say supporters up and down the @entity4 chain , is to put their people in @entity7 positions of power from the bottom to the top , and change the party			1
saturday , the few hundred voters at @entity1 's @entity204 convention chose between seven candidates for three national convention seats			0
while @entity51 came in fifth , his friend and fellow @entity4 supporter @entity207 took third place and won a spot for libertarians in @entity180			2
@entity20 says @entity4 supporters have won 15 of the 24 congressional delegate spots decided in @entity1 so far			1
add it to the list			0
@entity4 took all 21 elected delegate spots in @entity219 and the vast majority of the elected delegate positions in @entity222 , state party officials confirmed to @entity2			1
party officials in @entity224 have not been able to certify their exact results to @entity2 but agreed that @entity4 won most of the up - for - grabs delegates there as well			1
that is especially notable because @entity224 's delegates are not bound on the first ballot at the national convention			0
but the 2012 nomination is not the point , @entity51 reminded those around him			0
instead , it 's learning the process , getting better at it , gaining positions and changing the @entity7 , no matter how long it takes			1
" we 're all getting training on the ground now , " he said			0
" at the end of the day , this is all practice for the next time			1
and the next time all be practice for the time after that			2
and eventually we are going to win			0
" it is a big plan , requiring not just determination but stamina .			0

@entity4 supporters want bottom - to - top takeover of @entity7
part of the plan is electing supporters to party posts from local level and up
supporters say they 're looking beyond 2012 to what 's down the road
" at the end of the day , this is all practice for the next time , " @entity4 director says
