-- an @entity2 driver recently made a confession that he caused a fatal wrong - way crash after drinking heavily			1
that , by itself , nothing new			0
after all , every day , hundreds of suspects sign full confessions , and many more defendants plead guilty before a judge			0
a person volunteering to take criminal responsibility is not a novel concept			1
in fact , it 's commonplace procedure in police interview rooms and courthouses			2
nor is it unique that these admissions are videotaped ; police often tape interview confessions and courtrooms record most guilty pleas			0
what 's novel in this case is the way he took that responsibility : 1 ) on his own			1
in a remarkably well - produced , three - and - a - half minute video , @entity32 admitted he killed a suburban @entity35 man , said he " made a mistake " in deciding to drive that evening and urged people not to drink and drive			1
in making this video , it clearly appeared he was not coerced			2
he was not being interrogated or even interviewed by police			0
in fact , he volunteered this admission , stating that he was fully aware of the consequences			0
skeptics have suggested the online confession is not sincere and he only produced the video to curry favor with the court to receive a lesser sentence			1
quite the contrary , @entity32 has risked sealing his fate with a maximum sentence by giving this confession			1
many others have applauded this act by @entity32			1
undoubtedly there is a benefit to society in taking responsibility			2
he not only gives the victim 's family closure , but he also saves the people of the state of @entity2 the cost and burden of a trial			1
even the victim 's ex-wife has opined that perhaps @entity32 deserves some consideration for his video apology			1
@entity71 , right ? wrong			0
while this may have appeared a morally correct thing for @entity32 to do , our justice system can actually penalize those who " do the right thing " and volunteer admissions			1
@entity32 's case just might end up as an example of this			1
in a criminal prosecution , the strongest playing card in the hand of the defendant is a guilty plea			0
sometimes , it 's the only card he holds			2
in @entity32 's case , assuming for the moment that this case was what we defense attorneys call a " dead - bang loser " ( one likely to be lost at trial ) , then his defense attorney could have approached the prosecution and made an offer : in exchange for a lesser sentence or charges , @entity32 would plead guilty , apologize to the family and save the prosecutor 's office the manpower and the burden of trying the case , and ultimately , the risk of losing at trial			1
in return , the prosecution would agree to a lesser sentence or a lesser charge			2
in this case , @entity32 's voluntary mea culpa actually eliminated his strongest bargaining chip			1
the defense now has nothing to offer the prosecution , so the prosecution has no incentive to make any concessions in a plea offer			0
now , if this were a business transaction or negotiation , you 'd say : well , that 's the way business is			2
too bad , so sad			0
that 's just market forces and economic darwinism at work			2
but prosecutors have a greater moral obligation than a ceo or an investor			0
they can not simply exploit any weakness in the defendant 's bartering position			2
prosecutors have a greater moral obligation : justice			2
it 's not an easy job at all			2
so , has @entity32 's prosecutor adequately considered the video ? the prosecutor in this case has said he will seek the maximum sentence and suggested that his office has enough evidence to seek a conviction notwithstanding the video confession			1
the maximum sentence ? is that how we should incentivize taking responsibility ? after all , @entity32 is partially correct in that he has spared resources and offered a judicially efficient resolution			1
in the video , @entity32 says : " i consulted some high - powered attorneys , who told me stories about similar cases where the drivers got off			1
they were convinced that they could get my blood test thrown out			0
and all i would have to do for that was lie			0
well , i wo n't go down that path			0
" first , it 's doubtful any experienced @entity171 lawyer really told @entity32 to lie			1
the obvious reason is that it 's unethical			2
but second , thanks to modern defense strategies and technology , challenging breath and blood testing has arguably never been more effective			0
recently , courts have invalidated scores of breath and blood tests for a myriad of reasons related to the reliability of the science as applied , including improper blood draws / retention , administration of tests , noncalibration of blood testing devices and improper lab procedures			0
because @entity171 trials can be burdensome for the prosecution , most jurisdictions have adopted some version of a pretrial program to treat this crime differently than most others			0
the quid pro quo is usually this : the defendant admits to what he did , gets a one - time admission to probation and a ton of fines and fees , avoiding a criminal conviction , and the prosecution is saved the burden of calling breathalyzer operators and lab technicians to trial and avoids the risk of loss at trial			0
as in the court system , drinking and driving is also treated differently than other taboos in society			0
certainly in public , we all agree it 's wrong			0
but when a rustic pub is isolated on a winding country back road and the parking lot is filled with cars on a friday night , does anyone doubt how the patrons arrived ? or how they plan to leave ? there are not a lot of subway stops , taxis or bus routes out at the more rural watering holes or even in the city suburbs			0
we publicly oppose drinking and driving , but we also are all aware it 's going on everywhere -- and with our tacit permission			1
until we resolve the social paradox that is drinking and driving , more than a few citizens will read about @entity32 's case and admit , to themselves : " coulda been me			1
" or worse : " that was me last saturday			0
" what happens when or if it is you that is in @entity32 's position ? will you still be an @entity254 crusader ? will you fight the breath and blood tests tooth - and - nail ? or will you take personal responsibility ? @entity258 video , perhaps ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity262 .			1

@entity2 man confesses online to killing someone while driving drunk
@entity262 : @entity32 's video was an *admirable* effort to take responsibility
he says @entity32 's candor could lead to a more *severe* sentence than usual
@entity262 : prosecutor should take interests of justice into account
