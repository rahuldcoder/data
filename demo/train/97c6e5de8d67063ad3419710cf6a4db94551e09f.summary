a previously secret document found at @entity2 's compound in @entity3 sets out a detailed @entity5 strategy for attacking targets in @entity7 and the @entity8			1
the document -- a letter written to @entity2 in march 2010 by a senior operational figure in the terror group -- reveals that tunnels , bridges , dams , undersea pipelines and internet cables were among the targets			1
it was written by @entity20 , a senior @entity5 planner thought to have been behind an ambitious plan to hit " soft " targets in @entity7 in the fall of 2010			1
the @entity8 @entity24 passed the letter to @entity27 prosecutors last year for use in an ongoing trial in @entity30 because it possibly refers to one of the defendants , according to the @entity27 newspaper @entity33 , which first broke the story			0
@entity35 has obtained details of the document from sources briefed on its contents			0
the 17 - page letter is in @entity42			0
@entity43 proposed that @entity5 recruits take jobs with companies transporting gasoline and and other sensitive companies in the @entity49 , and await the right moment to strike			1
he said targets should include tunnels , airports and even " @entity56 " -- gay and lesbian events held every summer in @entity27			2
he said recruits should infiltrate university courses in the @entity49 in key subjects useful to the group including physics and chemistry , so that they could later be re-activated and help the group , according to @entity33			0
he also suggested attaching mines to undersea pipelines using mini-submarines -- and appears to have researched ways to circumvent safety valves on such pipelines			0
@entity70 also proposed that @entity5 attack financial centers and think - tanks -- specifically mentioning the @entity73 , whose headquarters are in @entity75			1
asked if it was aware of the threat , a spokesman for @entity73 told @entity35 that " as a matter of policy , the @entity73 does not comment on specific security issues or potential threats			0
" @entity83 , an investigative reporter with @entity33 in @entity84 , says the document seems " to support information gleaned from other terror trials that @entity5 in 2010 was trying to plan a comprehensive plot against the @entity49 , " and @entity20 appears to have been bent on " hitting @entity7 and the @entity8 by targeting critical infrastructure and economic targets			1
" some of @entity20 's ideas may seem far - fetched , but they underline @entity5 's continuing fascination with bringing down airliners			1
he proposed that men recruited into the @entity97 affiliate @entity96 become pilots with airlines , and then drug their co-pilots before flying the plane into a target			0
one target he identified was the massive petrochemical facility at @entity106 in @entity107			0
@entity70 suggested that @entity2 signal the go - ahead for attacks in @entity7 with a public message that @entity5 's patience with @entity7 had run out			1
and he had a clear sense of how to finance attacks , saying that @entity114 ( @entity114 ) had " millions " and its leaders trusted him , according to @entity33			0
@entity20 himself was originally from @entity117 in north - @entity118			1
sources briefed on the contents of the letter told @entity35 that @entity20 wrote that @entity122 in @entity3 could only cover the starting costs of the operation against @entity7 and additional costs would have to be covered by @entity114 and others			1
analysts tell @entity129 's call for the various nodes of @entity5 to work together was emblemmatic of a shift within the terrorist network towards greater coordination and pooling of resources			2
phone call links @entity138 attack to @entity5 commander @entity43 added that @entity114 had a " great deal of trust " in him , according to the sources			2
according to analysts the @entity144 operative paved the way for direct cooperation between @entity114 and @entity5 's senior leadership in the late 2000s after he travelled to @entity3			1
in late 2011 @entity149 , then a senior figure in @entity114 , told a @entity117 journalist that @entity20 was the " first direct contact between us and our brothers in @entity5			1
" @entity2 appears to have liked the ideas in @entity20 's letter , and assigned them high priority			2
other documents found at his @entity3 compound in @entity160 suggest he forwarded it to at least one other senior figure in @entity5			1
in around june 2010 , @entity2 wrote to senior @entity164 operative @entity163 , then @entity5 's head of operations in @entity167 , instructing him to tell the leaders of the @entity5 affiliates @entity114 in @entity144 and @entity96 in @entity172 to " put forward their best in cooperating " with @entity20 " in whatever he asks of them			1
" " hint to the brothers in the @entity177 that they provide him with the financial support that he might need in the next six months , to the tune of approximately 200,000 euros , " @entity2 wrote			0
@entity35 has learned the document was sent to @entity27 prosecutors by the @entity24 after they had asked for any information the @entity8 might have about three men from the @entity30 area charged with planning an attack in @entity27 on behalf of @entity5 in april 2011			2
@entity35 asked the @entity24 about the document but has so far received no comment			0
according to @entity33 , the reason the letter was relayed to the @entity27 was because @entity20 mentions a @entity193 in the document with exactly the same date of birth as @entity197 , who prosecutors claim was the ringleader of the alleged @entity30 cell and trained with @entity5 in @entity3 in 2010			1
sources briefed on the contents of the document told @entity35 that @entity20 appears to suggest the @entity193 should travel to join up with militants in @entity204 if his mission failed			2
sources say three @entity208 officials will testify at the trial in @entity30 wednesday on the authenticity of the document			0
defense lawyers say they have " fundamental doubts " about the document			0
as for @entity20 , he is unlikely to have any role in bringing his terror plans to fruition			2
he was picked up by @entity3 police in @entity219 in august 2011 and remains in detention			0
@entity3 authorities appear to have uncovered some of his terror plans			0
in announcing his arrest a month later , they stated : @entity20 " was tasked personally by @entity2 to focus on hitting targets of economical importance in @entity8 , @entity7 and @entity227 , including gas pipelines , power generating dams and oil tankers			1
" several of @entity20 's western recruits -- trained in the tribal territories of @entity3 -- have been arrested on their return home			1
@entity8 @entity5 recruit @entity236 testified at his trial that that he had drawn a map for @entity20 in mid- 2008 , showing @entity240 lines			1
@entity43 had decided the best scheme would be to launch a suicide bombing on a train as it entered a tunnel			0
and he told @entity236 that preferably a white operative with @entity247 travel documents would be tasked to carry out the attack			0
in 2010 , @entity20 was seen as the mastermind of planned attacks in @entity7			1
fears that such attacks would materialize led the @entity253 to issue a travel alert in october 2010			0
sources briefed on the letter told @entity35 that @entity20 requested @entity2 issue a statement saying @entity5 's patience with @entity7 had run out following the @entity5 leader 's previous offering of a conditional truce , and that his statement needed to be choreographed with an attack shortly afterwards			1
" we ask you undertake certain steps in order to threaten @entity7 before the attacks happen			2
and these steps should be in synch with the preparations of those attacks			0
inform @entity7 that patience has come to an end , as has our hope that they end their campaign against us			2
also [ make clear ] that they have not understood our message thus far			0
one or two weeks after that we will strike ... and then we will threaten them again			0
after we hit @entity7 we will hit @entity8 , so we isolate the @entity8 , " the sources said @entity20 wrote in the letter			1
@entity33 's @entity83 says @entity20 's blueprint " has very likely little operational value now			2
but certain ideas may have trickled down and may still be alive elsewhere in the network			0
" read related : opinion : strange bedfellows -- @entity288 and @entity5			2

it was written by @entity20 , a senior @entity5 planner
