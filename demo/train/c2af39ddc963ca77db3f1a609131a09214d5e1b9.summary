-- a @entity3 estimate made after the explosion of the @entity5 noted that as much as 100,000 barrels per day could leak into the ocean if the blowout preventer and wellhead were removed , a higher worst - case scenario than previously reported			1
according to an internal @entity3 document released sunday by rep. @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity3 believed that the worst - case scenario could be as high as 100,000 barrels , or 4.2 million gallons of oil per day			1
the figure is the highest yet to surface regarding the leaking oil well			1
at the disaster 's outset , @entity3 claimed the leak was about 1,000 barrels a day , a number it later revised to 5,000 and then much higher			1
@entity3 told the @entity22 that the worst - case scenario was 60,000 barrels ( 2.5 million gallons ) a day , lower than what the document states			1
the document , submitted in may , maintains the 60,000 barrel estimate , but stipulates that if the " blowout preventer and wellhead are removed and if we have incorrectly modeled the restrictions , the rate could be as high as 100,000 barrels a day			2
" @entity11 said the document " raises very troubling questions about what @entity3 knew and when they knew it			1
" " it is clear that , from the beginning , @entity3 has not been straightforward with the government or the @entity41 people about the true size of this spill , " said @entity11 , the chairman of the @entity36 in the @entity22			1
" considering what is now known about @entity3 's problems with this well prior to the @entity5 explosion , including cementing issues , leaks in the blowout preventer and gas kicks , @entity3 should have been more honest about the dangerous condition of the well bore , " @entity11 said in a statement			1
@entity3 spokesman @entity54 said the may estimate cited in @entity11 's document is irrelevant to the current situation because the oil company has no intention of removing the well 's blowout preventer			1
" the allegation does n't make sense , " wine told @entity0			0
" why on earth would we remove the blowout preventer when it 's sitting on top of the sea well and providing some control ( of the spill ) ? " @entity72 , another spokesman for @entity3 , added that the blowout preventer will be removed only when the well is completely killed			2
a blowout preventer is designed to seal off a well in the event of an emergency , but the device has not been working since the april 20 explosion aboard the @entity5			0
also sunday , while cleanup crews and technical teams continued efforts to stop crude gushing into the @entity87 , @entity82 lawmakers proposed a different approach : prayer			1
state senators designated sunday as a day for citizens to ask for @entity93 's help dealing with the oil disaster			0
" thus far efforts made by mortals to try to solve the crisis have been to no avail , " state sen. @entity95 said in a statement released after last week 's unanimous vote for the day of prayer			0
" it is clearly time for a miracle for us			0
" the resolution names sunday as a statewide day of prayer in @entity82 and calls on people of all religions throughout the @entity109 " to pray for an end to this environmental emergency , sparing us all from the destruction of both culture and livelihood			1
" also sunday , wildlife officials were planning to transport and release 40 pelicans that rescuers rehabilitated after finding them covered with oil			0
the birds will be moved from @entity121 , @entity82 , to the @entity122 in @entity123 , @entity124			2
as much as 60,000 barrels ( 2.5 million gallons ) of oil may be gushing into the @entity87 every day , new government estimates found last week			0
@entity3 said it was able to capture roughly 8,480 barrels of oil from midnight to 12 p.m. saturday			2
the company said it captured 24,500 barrels -- just over a million gallons -- of oil friday , a little less than it captured the day before			0
@entity3 said saturday that it has paid $ 104 million to residents along the @entity109 who have filed claims related to the @entity132 , issuing more than 31,000 checks in the past seven weeks			2
there was no immediate response from local , state or federal officials to @entity3 's tally of its payments			2
meanwhile , oil recovery efforts in the @entity87 resumed saturday morning on the drill ship @entity141 , after work was suspended for about 10 hours because of a mechanical problem			0
a venting device aboard the drilling ship was not working properly , said @entity147 , spokesperson for the @entity5 command center			0
other recovery efforts continued during the time that the @entity141 was idled , she said			0
she said the problem was with a blocked flame arrester , designed to prevent oil from combusting by extinguishing the flame .			0
