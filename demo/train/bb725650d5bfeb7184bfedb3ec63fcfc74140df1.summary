nineteen years ago , @entity0 and @entity1 celebrated the birth of a son			1
sunday , they should have celebrated @entity6 ' birthday with him			1
instead , they faced the prospect of a new trial for the man accused of killing him			2
a jury in @entity12 on saturday found @entity14 guilty of attempted second - degree murder for opening fire on three other teens in the same suv as @entity6 -- but deadlocked on the murder charge against him in @entity6 ' death			1
prosecutors had argued that @entity14 recklessly shot at the teens after complaining about the volume of their music in a convenience store parking lot			1
three of his 10 shots struck @entity6 , one of them cutting through his liver , a lung and his aorta			1
@entity14 testified that @entity6 threatened him and that he thought he saw a gun sticking out of the @entity34			1
but @entity0 said his son was a good kid and did n't deserve to be collateral damage in an argument over loud music			0
@entity1 said she was happy for a little bit of closure			0
" it 's sad for mr. @entity14 that he will live the rest of his life in that sense of torment , and i will pray for him , " @entity1 said			1
" and i have asked my family to pray for him , but we are so grateful for the charges that have been brought against him			0
we are so grateful for the truth			0
" and moments before prosecutor @entity52 said she would seek a new trial on the murder charge , @entity1 said she and her ex-husband will continue to stand up for their son , who was 17 when he was killed			1
" we will continue to wait for justice for @entity6 , " she said			1
verdict evokes mixed reactions shooter faces decades in prison a jury on saturday night convicted @entity14 of three charges of attempted murder for shooting at the other three teenagers in the suv and one count of shooting into the vehicle on november 23 , 2012			1
as the jury 's decisions became clear about 7 p.m. saturday , @entity14 looked ahead solemnly with a frown but no tears			1
his lawyer , @entity74 , told reporters later that his client was " in disbelief			0
" " even as he sat next to me , he asked , how is this happening , " @entity74 said			0
" ... it has not set in			0
i do n't think it will set in anytime soon			0
" @entity0 was pleased that @entity14 face 60 years or more in prison for the attempted murder charges			1
" he is going to learn that he must be remorseful for the killing of my son , that it was not just another day at the office			0
my son will never be just another day at the office where ( @entity14 ) can leave the scene and be stoic , " he told reporters			1
he wanted it known that @entity6 was not a troublemaker			1
" it was n't allowed to be said in the courtroom , but he was a good kid			0
he was a good kid , " he said			0
" there are a lot of good kids out there ... and they should have a voice			0
they should n't live in fear and walk around the streets worrying about if someone has a problem with somebody else that if they are shot , it is just collateral damage			0
" the incomplete finale to this hot - button trial -- emotionally charged partly because @entity14 is white and the teenagers he shot at are black -- echoed @entity112 's trial for the killing of 17 - year - old @entity114 about 120 miles down the road in @entity116 , @entity117			1
while the state 's " stand your ground " law was n't used by @entity14 , his lawyers did argue that he fired in self - defense			1
opinion : @entity117 shooter saw black , thought ' threat ' another murder trial ? given the partially hung jury , @entity128 , @entity117 's state attorney , said prosecutors would press for a new trial in @entity132 on the murder charge			1
" justice for @entity6 is as important as it is for any victim , " said @entity128 , whose office also handled the @entity112 case			1
even without a final decision on the murder count -- and pending defense appeals -- the 47 - year - old @entity14 is looking at a lengthy prison term			1
prosecutor @entity143 explained saturday night that each attempted second - degree murder conviction carries a minimum sentence of at least 20 years			1
there 's also a 15 - year sentence possible on the conviction for shooting into the teenagers ' vehicle			1
" you are looking basically at life in prison , " @entity74 said , even as he vowed to challenge the convictions			2
" at 47 years old , that 's a life sentence regardless of count one			2
" @entity159 legal analyst @entity158 said in most cases prosecutors will take some time after a mistrial to reflect on the case before planning the next steps			2
" if he winds up with 60 or 75 years in jail , from a pragmatic standpoint it does n't make a whole lot of sense to retry the case , " he said sunday			1
" on the other hand if you 're the parents of @entity6 and you believe , as well you should , that your son 's reputation has been besmirched by this self - defense claim , the family ( might ) want a retrial , and that 's something that a prosecutor has to consider carefully			1
" hopefully ( @entity128 will ) look carefully at the pluses and minuses of doing a retrial			0
" the decision to convict on these counts , and not on murder , did n't come easily for a jury that had deliberated for about 30 hours since getting the case late wednesday			2
judge @entity188 acknowledged earlier saturday that the jury of four white women , two black women , four white men , an @entity193 woman and a @entity195 man was " struggling , obviously			0
" " but it 's not for want of trying to reconcile all of this , " he said then			2
" i think we 've got some analytical people in there who are trying to do just that -- trying to analyze this from every possible angle			0
" the lack of a murder conviction upset some , including protesters who marched outside the @entity12 courthouse calling for @entity128 to lose her job			2
" the people united will never be defeated , " they chanted			0
confrontation at a gas station it was november 23 , 2012 , when @entity14 pulled into a gas station in @entity12 , parking next to a red @entity34 with four teenagers inside			2
the teens had come in for gum and cigarettes ; @entity14 , meanwhile , had just left his son 's wedding with his fiancee , who 'd gone inside the convenience store for wine and chips			1
@entity14 did n't like the loud music -- " rap crap , " as he called it -- coming from the teens ' suv			2
so he asked them to turn it down			0
what followed next depends on whom you believe			0
@entity14 says @entity6 threatened him , and he decided to take matters into his own hands upon seeing what he thought was the barrel of a gun sticking out of the @entity34			1
but prosecutors say it was @entity14 who lost control , firing three volleys of shots -- 10 bullets total -- at the suv over music he did n't like			1
prosecutors challenged what he did next : he left the gas station and drove to his hotel , about three miles away			2
there , @entity14 walked his dog , ordered a pizza , then drank rum and cola -- " stunned and horrified , ( shocked how ) things escalated the way they did over a common courtesy			2
" after learning almost six hours later that he had killed @entity6 , @entity14 testified that he became " crazy with grief , " experiencing stomach problems for about four hours before taking a nap			1
" my intent was to stop the attack , not necessarily end a life , " he testified			0
" it just worked out that way			0
" yet his fiancee , @entity6 , testified that @entity14 had never mentioned any weapon to her -- be it a shotgun , a stick , a barrel or a lead pipe			1
in fact , police found a basketball , basketball shoes , clothing , a camera tripod and cups inside the teenagers ' @entity34			0
@entity14 himself never called police			2
the first contact he had with them was at his home in @entity288 as he was being apprehended			0
arguing that he was n't in a rational state of mind , @entity14 admitted , " it makes sense that i should have ( contacted authorities )			2
i ca n't tell you why			0
" echoes of @entity114 and @entity112 some people were quick to compare @entity14 to @entity112 , who ultimately was acquitted of murder for the shooting of @entity114			1
@entity114 's own parents were among them , claiming @entity6 ' killing is another reminder that , in @entity117 , " racial profiling and stereotypes " may serve as the basis for illegitimate fear " and the shooting and killing of young teenagers			1
" but @entity14 's defense attorney , @entity74 , told @entity159 's @entity311 on friday that the @entity112 and @entity14 cases are n't so similar			1
there was a physical confrontation between @entity112 and @entity114 , and police gave @entity112 the benefit of the doubt about defending himself , @entity74 said			0
" my client did not wait to become that victim , " he said			0
" my client did not wait to either get assaulted by a weapon or have someone potentially pull a trigger , " he said			0
though a weapon was never found , @entity74 maintains the youths could have had one and somehow ditched it			0
he said the key point was that @entity14 believed they were armed and that his life was in danger			2
" now , does it sound irrational ? of course it sounds irrational			0
but have you ever been in that situation ? " the lawyer asked			0
@entity74 said saturday the four convictions leave him with regret , even as he said he could n't immediately think of anything he 'd do differently in the case			0
at the same time , the prosecution did n't manage a conviction on what was by far the biggest charge : first - degree murder			1
this mixed bag means that no one can fully celebrate the jury 's decision			2
" everybody lost something in this , " the lawyer said			0
his client " will live to fight another day " in court , but he and his loved ones are suffering now , @entity74 said			0
he acknowledged , too , the pain felt by @entity6 ' family .			2

@entity14 is convicted on three counts of attempted second - degree murder
but there 's a mistrial on first - degree murder ; prosecutors say they *'ll* seek a new trial
@entity14 faces 60 years in prison , possibly 15 more for another charge
the teen killed , @entity6 , would have celebrated his 19th birthday sunday
