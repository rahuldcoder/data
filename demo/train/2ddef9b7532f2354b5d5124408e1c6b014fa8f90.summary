-- @entity1 is testing @entity3 display screens as large as 6 inches , according to a new report			1
the screens , ranging upward from 4.8 inches , would be a pretty massive leap from the 4 - inch display on the @entity3			1
but do n't expect to see them when @entity1 rolls out new @entity9 next week			0
citing " people familiar with the matter , " the @entity10 on friday reported that the bigger screens could signal a future move by @entity1 to offer iphones of various sizes			1
that would put them more in line with their chief rival , @entity22 , which has put a dent in the @entity3 's dominance with devices like their @entity26 and @entity28 note lines			0
on wednesday , @entity22 unveiled its @entity29 , with a whopping 5.7 - inch display that further blurs the boundary between large phone and small tablet			1
on tuesday , @entity1 is expected to roll out two different @entity9 -- an update to the @entity3 and a cheaper model that would be designed to appeal to buyers in emerging markets like @entity38 and @entity39			2
@entity1 ceo @entity40 has knocked @entity1 's rivals for making " trade - offs " in order to pack larger screens into phones , although he has not ruled out such a move for future iphones			2
opinions are split on whether @entity1 will also introduce other products , like a new @entity50 or a much - anticipated smartwatch , next week			0
the @entity10 report said the @entity9 unveiled next tuesday will likely have the same size screen as the current model			0
an @entity1 spokesperson , predictably , declined to comment .			0
