" i once told a friend ' why rob a straight guy of $ 20 when you can rob a drug dealer of $ 10,000 and he ca n't go running to the police ' , " he said on his website , arguing that an honest man is more likely to put up a fight for a hard - earned $ 20 than a drug - dealer for thousands in fast cash from the proceeds of crime			0

the next day , somewhat worse for wear and after having offered @entity1 a couch for the night , @entity110 awoke at 8 a.m. to find @entity1 had already gone			1
" he 'd left this lovely note thanking me for my hospitality , saying i should contact him if i was ever in @entity43 , " he said			0
" later that day i met a friend for lunch at a @entity137 © and when it came to the bill i thought there must be some change left from my winnings the night before but when i opened my wallet there was n't one cent left -- chopper had knocked it off ! " working as i do for the media , everyone wanted to write the story but i did n't want it to get out : i simply thought i 'd kept fast company and paid the price and put it down to that			1

" inside he 'd written ' congratulations on your ordination into a very select group of people who 've been pinched by @entity1 and lived to tell the tale			2
i 'm sorry @entity176 but i 'm a hopeless kleptomaniac , especially after a few red wines			0
i 'll nick anything if it 's not bolted down , and if it is , i 'll use a heavy vehicle to rip it off			2
' " of course , everyone standing around me fell about laughing			0
" ' bull * * * * artist ' he said while many of @entity122 's exploits were well documented , he was well known for embellishing the truth			2
" at one stage in the evening i told him i thought he was the biggest bull * * * * artist i 'd ever met , " @entity110 said			0
" he suddenly stood up and towered over me and one of my friends thought ' oh no , there 's going to be blood and guts everywhere now			2
