" in his book , @entity1 says the way a man introduces you gives good insight into the status of your relationship			1
if a man introduces you as a friend or says your name with no title at all , @entity1 says you have nothing			1
" we 're very protective			2
if a man loves you ... he 's willing to profess it			2
he 'll give you a title after a while			2
you 're going to be his lady , his woman , his fiancée , his wife , his baby 's mama , something , " he says			2
" if he 's introducing you after six months , ' this is ... @entity11 , ' you should be standing there going , ' this is going nowhere			2
' " @entity0 : read an excerpt from this best - selling book ! man with a plan another thing women need to understand , according to @entity1 , is that every man has a plan			1
" men do n't come up to you to just talk			1
we come up to you with a plan , " he says			2
" we 're looking across the room at you , and we do n't care about your hopes and dreams			2
we do n't care about what your future holds			2
we saw something we wanted			2
" when a man approaches a woman , @entity1 says , he already knows what we wants from her , but he does n't know what it will cost			1
" how much time do you want from me ? what your standards ? what are your requirements ? because we 'll rise to the occasion no matter how high you set the bar if we want to , " he says			1
" the problem is , women have stopped setting the bar high			1
" @entity0 : what 's your love type ? the cookie though a woman might want many things from a man , @entity1 says men only need three things : support , loyalty and sex			1
or as @entity1 calls it , " the cookie			1
" " we 've got to have your support			2
whatever adventure we 're out on , whatever pursuit in life , we need your support			2
then we need your loyalty			2
we 've got to know that you belong to us , " he says			2
" and we 've got to have a cookie			0

" kickin ' it in his book , @entity1 tells the story of his father - in - law 's first introduction to one of @entity1 's daughter 's boyfriends			1
" [ my 26 - year - old daughter ] was dating this guy who was about 30			1
he had been over to the house about four , five times			0
and my father - in - law was visiting from @entity140 , " @entity1 says			1
" he 's in the kitchen and he 's eating and [ my daughter 's ] boyfriend is in there , and [ my father - in - law ] goes : ' so , son , sit down			0
tell me , what 's your plan for my granddaughter ? ' " after plenty of hemming and hawing , @entity1 says the boyfriend finally said that the two were just " kickin ' it			1
" @entity1 was pretty confident his daughter did n't have the same interpretation of the relationship , he says			1
" i said : ' cool			0
let 's bring my daughter in there			0
let 's inform her that she 's just being kicked ... let 's see if that 's what she wants to do , " he says			0
" they broke up the next day			0
" gone fishin ' @entity1 says men are like fishermen -- but women are actually the ones looking for a good catch			1
you wo n't be able to find one , though , until you up your standards			0
" you 've got sports fishermen , and you 've got guys out there fishing to eat			0
you 've got guys that are fishing to keep the fish , and you 've got guys that are fishing to catch them , unhook them and throw them back , " @entity1 says			1
" you 've got to determine along the way which one of the fish you 're going to be			0
" without ironclad standards , @entity1 says you 'll always end up back in the dating pool			1
" you 've got to quit lowering your standards , " he says			0
" set your requirements up front so when a guy hooks you , he has to know this is business			1
" and do n't let the man set the pace of the relationship -- @entity1 says it 's always the woman who has total control			1
" with all that power , why do you suddenly relinquish this power just because you want a guy to accept you ? that 's stupid , " he says			0
" say : ' look , if you want to be with me , this is what you got to do			0
this is what it takes to get to me			0
' " when should you sleep with your new boyfriend ? as an auto plant worker , @entity1 says he had to wait 90 days to receive benefits -- and says the same probation period should apply to dating			1
" in 90 days they checked me out			1
they determined if i was easy to work with , if i got along well with others , if i showed up when i said i was going to show up , if i was worthy			0
" women , @entity1 says , hold the greatest benefit of all -- the cookie -- so there 's no reason to give it away until you know your man deserves it			1
" slow down , ladies , " @entity1 says			1
" look , you can not run us off			0
" so what if you do n't want to wait 90 days ? @entity1 says if you change the probation period , you do so at your own risk			1
" you all keep changing the rules			0
and men are aware of the fact that you are changing the rules			1
we 're aware of the fact that you act desperate			0
we 're aware of the fact that you think there 's a good shortage of good men out there , " he says			1
" we play on all of that			0
... we created the term ' gold digger ' so you wo n't ask us for nothing			1
we created the term ' nagging ' so you can quit badgering us			1
these are terms that we created so you can require less of us			2
" mr. fix - it @entity1 says four little words can strike fear and dread into any man : we need to talk			1
" you just drove a nail in his forehead , " @entity1 says			1
men are fixers , not talkers , @entity1 says , so it 's better to get to the point			1
" when you say , ' we need to talk , ' we put up the barriers , " he says			0
" i tell ladies , just sit down and strike up a conversation			0
" @entity0 : how to talk to a brick wall turn off the text social networking web sites and text messages can be a great way to keep in touch with friends , but @entity1 says it 's not the best way to date			1
" you have nothing if you 're texting a guy in a relationship , " he says			2
" we can text six women a minute			2
we can text it and push ' reply all			0
' i mean , since we 're lying , we might as well lie to everybody			0
" if you want the relationship to be more , take it face - to - face			0
" women talk about [ how ] chivalry 's dead			2
chivalry 's not dead -- it 's just not required anymore , " he says			0
" you 've got to get a guy in your face			0
... @entity299 has given you all this incredible thing called intuition			0
you 've got to use that			0
" safety first you know you 've got a keeper when your man wants to make sure you 're always safe , @entity1 says			1

" i ca n't go home without her			0
we 've got seven kids between us , " @entity1 says			1
" they need their mother			0
i 'm not a good mother at all			0

comedian @entity1 says women set the bar too low when dating
@entity1 : workers wait 90 days for benefits ; women should date 90 days before sex
texting is not dating , says @entity1 , just easier way for men to tell more lies
men use terms like " gold digger " and " nagging " as *weapons* against women
