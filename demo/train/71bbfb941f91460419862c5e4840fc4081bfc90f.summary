-- it 's not just for @entity3 kissing or for showing your dissatisfaction			0
besides showing off at concerts , licking lollipops , and teasing , the tongue could help people gain mobility			1
aside from everyday functions of chewing , swallowing , talking and tasting , the tongue has new uses such as steering wheelchairs and helping blind people see			1
also in @entity18 last month , doctors transplanted a tongue as part of a face transplant surgery			1
" the tongue is considered very much like the trunk of an elephant or the tentacle of the octopus			1
it 's the same kind of structure with how many shapes , configurations the trunk or tentacle can assume , " said @entity27 , an assistant professor of physiology at the @entity29 in @entity30			0
" researchers realize there is a lot of potential there			2
" transplanting tongues a team of surgeons in @entity18 last month performed a face transplant , which is considered the first to include the tongue and jaws			1
a 43 - year - old man who lost his jaws and tongue after a cancer battle 11 years ago received a transplant for the bottom third of his face , according to the @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity18			1
dr. @entity56 , the surgical team leader , said the objective was for the patient to recover feeling in his face and also to swallow , talk , feel and taste with his tongue again			1
but the first tongue transplant in 2003 had short - lived results			1
doctors in @entity65 transplanted a tongue to a 42 - year - old cancer patient			1
the cancer returned and the patient died 13 months after the surgery , according to a 2008 article written by his doctors in the journal @entity74			2
a transplant recipient has to take immune suppressing drugs so he or she wo n't reject the new organ			2
but this puts the person at risk for cancer recurrence because of the weakened immune system , said dr. @entity85 , a head and neck surgical oncologist at the @entity89 in @entity90			0
unlike liver or kidney transplants , reconnecting the tongue is also more complex because of its nerves , said @entity85 , who is the director of the microvascular program			2
" a nerve is not like a single wire in your house , " he said			0
" when we say a nerve , there are literally thousands if not hundred thousands of tiny little fibers			0
it 'll be like taking a fiber optic cable and cutting it -- let 's say that cable had 100,000 fibers in it -- how do you realign it ? " @entity85 said : " if we can get some way of knowing which way to hook the nerves up , someday it 'll work better			0
right now , we 're not there			0
" driving wheelchairs a new kind of wheelchair allows people who can not use their hands and feet to steer using simple tongue movements			1
this technology can assist people who have spinal cord injuries , said @entity126 , an assistant professor in the @entity127 at the @entity128			2
unlike hands and feet , the tongue has a distinct advantage because it does n't connect to the spinal cord , he said			2
to use the wheelchair , a magnet the size of a lentil sits on the driver 's tongue affixed by edible glue			1
when the person in the wheelchair touches a certain tooth with his or her tongue , the wheelchair moves -- for example , a left tooth , the wheelchair will turn left			1
magnetic sensors trace the movement of the tongue and transmit the directions to get the wheelchair moving			1
" the tongue is always moving , but the technology is smart enough to tell the difference between natural movements and the tongue movements [ meant to steer the wheelchair ] , " @entity126 said			1
researchers conducted clinical trials this summer in which people with spinal cord injuries navigated through an obstacle course using their tongues			1
those who had recently been injured were more receptive to driving with their tongues than others who have gotten used to the existing technology , @entity126 said			0
the tongue - driven wheelchair is not available to the public yet , pending more clinical trials in 2010			1
aiding vision researchers devised an instrument to allow users to " see " through the tongue			1
called the @entity181 , the vision device sits on the tongue to help blind people get a sense of their environment			1
the device , which is the size of a postage stamp , connects to a digital video camera			0
the camera paints the visual scene in front of a person by turning it into gentle stimulations on the tongue that feel like bubbles			2
for example , when a person moves across the room , the device creates vibrations across the tongue to resemble the movement			2
@entity203 , a neuroscientist at the device maker 's company , @entity204 , said scientists turned to the tongue because " the tongue has a high density of nerve endings , which makes it sensitive			2
" other parts of the body , such as the back , were not sufficiently sensitive			0
the fingertips were sensitive enough , but people wanted full use of their hands to grip a cane or to grab objects			0
placing the device " on the tongue inside the mouth , frees the hands to interact with environment , " @entity203 said			0
plus , the device can be hidden in the mouth			0
the device is still in development , but @entity203 said the company hopes to make it available to the public within the next year			0
@entity231 senses sweet scientists at the @entity233 at @entity233 developed a handheld device the size of a business card , which can taste the sweetness in food and drinks			0
this could lead to the first electronic tongue that would be able to identify sources of sweetness			0
" we could determine what sweetener would be in your tea , " researcher @entity244 told @entity0			0
the device can distinguish among 14 kinds of sweeteners , from natural sugars to artificial ones such as @entity254			0
@entity255 described two possible applications : this would be a first step toward an electronic tongue and second , it could be a handheld device that would determine what sweetener and the amount .			0

researchers turn to the tongue for new ways to help people with disabilities
@entity18 doctors performed face transplant including tongue this summer
engineers are *testing* a wheelchair that can be steered by the tongue
