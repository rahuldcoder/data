-- the discussion of race is never a black and white issue , and recent " @entity11 " and @entity0 reports about young children 's attitudes on race became one of the most discussed stories on the site , eliciting more than 4,500 comments			1
in the study , white children had an overwhelming bias toward white , and black children also had a bias toward white , but it was not nearly as strong as the bias shown by the white children			1
many users of the site thought parenting was the issue behind the results , some thought the kids were too naive and others thought the testing method was flawed			1
kids ' test answers on race brings mother to tears @entity35 , a leading researcher in the field of child development , designed the pilot study for @entity0 's " @entity11			1
" @entity35 used a team of three psychologists to implement it : two testers to execute the study and a statistician to help analyze the results			1
her team tested 133 children from schools that met very specific economic and demographic requirements			2
in total , eight schools participated : four in the greater @entity52 area and four in @entity53			0
@entity55 's test aimed to re-create the landmark doll test from the 1940s			0
those tests , conducted by psychologists @entity60 and @entity61 , were designed to measure how segregation affected @entity65 - @entity64 children			2
full doll study results many people who read the story commented that racism is a learned behavior			1
" i do believe that parents must take an active role [ regardless of race ] to inform their children that they are no better or no worse than anyone because of race , " @entity71 wrote			1
" these lessons were taught to me and when i have children i will do the same			2
once this happens , then there will be less misconceptions and negative perceptions regarding race			2
" another reader thought many people missed the point of the results of the study			1
no one says the children are racist , @entity90 wrote			2
" the problem here is that if parents do not talk to their kid about race and how to perceive people that are ' different from them ' , they would simply form their opinions based on whatever [ right or wrong ] they gather from society			1
to suggest that anyone is labeling these innocent kids to be racist is merely unfortunate , " the writer said			2
watch the psychologist who devised the test talk about the role of parents one person said they had done a mini-survey with a much smaller sample set -- their children -- and said the results showed the influence television has on our lives			1
@entity119 said the same questions were posed as were new ones			0
the writer said that where they live , there is a big @entity127 population			0
the children chose a brown figure as the one most likely to have a drinking problem , the white figure as the one that was gay and the black doll was picked for the sports questions , he wrote			1
" i say , thank you media / tv , " realjoe wrote			0
a few readers thought the study was flawed			0
some thought more children should have been studied while others thought that 5 - year - olds wo n't give answers that prove anything			0
" for one thing , 5 - year - old children do n't have a broad base of experience and are inclined to pick the familiar , " andme2 wrote			0
" if the child does n't have any brown or black friends , chances are he or she will gravitate toward white children because children of a different color are unknowns in his or her life			1
" the reader thought it would have been better if the children were observed interacting with each other in different groups , but acknowledged that might have been an issue , too , " because the children would realize something was expected of them and might behave accordingly			0
" others said children -- and adults -- were conditioned to think of light objects as good and dark as bad			0
it 's " something human beings have been doing for thousands of years , " reader timmy2136 said			0
but others said the study 's results were the most important thing and the discussion over the methodology drew attention away from the revelations of the tests			2
" i think it 's interesting how many people want to fight the results , rather than conclude , ' hey , maybe it is a good idea to teach our kids when they are really young that we should n't judge people by the way they look , ' " @entity186 wrote			0
