@entity0 , @entity1 -- at the up - market " @entity7 " hair and beauty salon , in uptown @entity0 , entrepreneur @entity3 has her sights set on expanding her business			1
the growth is important to @entity3 , who bought the business a year ago , without the help of big banks			1
" a local small bank gave me my first break , " she says			2
" but it was n't without a lot of tears , tantrums , kickings and insisting that they would have to support me , " she adds			2
@entity3 , who has a background in banking , says it is difficult for women to get credit from banks to start businesses			1
" the bank will limit the financing to the security available , " says @entity3			0
" for the women in this region , that is the challenge , because that will involve things like land , which traditionally families will give that to men			1
" so for women , creativity is a big part			1
" that need for creative financing led @entity3 to start an investment group , or " chama " as they are popularly known in @entity46			1
unlike the traditional revolving fund groups that merely saved money , theirs is an active investment group			1
registered as @entity51 , the 21 - women in the group , mostly in their late 30s , are drawn from all sectors , ranging from finance to information technology to legal			1
their common goal is to build a solid retirement nest egg			1
each member 's monthly minimum contribution is about $ 200 but the more they contribute the more shares they get			0
@entity3 says when it comes to new members they look for someone who is interested in their long - term strategic vision and thus willing to pump in money for 10 years without getting any out			0
collectively , they have been able to purchase prime real estate , trade shares in the stock market and invest in unlisted , growing companies			0
" the chama has been very exciting in that it 's been much easier for us to quickly invest in big deals which would not have been possible if i tried to do ( it ) myself , " says @entity3			2
another member is @entity83 , the current chair and a legal expert working with the government			0
she says shared responsibility is important			0
" we hold each other accountable in terms of our resources , ensuring that we have something aside for our retirement , " she says			2
but even with their group 's achievements in just three years , @entity83 is quick to point out that it 's not all been smooth sailing			0
" all our personalities are different -- some people are fast at making decisions or have a greater risk appetite than others , " she says , and the members must balance their commitments to the chama with busy nine - to - five jobs			2
banking analysts say three out of every five @entity1 is part of a chama and banks have been moving to profit from this niche market			1
some banks have even created products that specifically target chama groups , with favorable interest rates and sizeable loan potential			1
@entity117 , a product manager with @entity118 , says : " we 're an @entity119 ( small and medium enterprise ) bank			0
we thought if we sit to get an sme that has grown 10 years we probably might miss out on the market , so we thought , let 's get these groups , empower them and grow them so that they become an sme from an early age			2
" though the group is run with a steady hand , the members still take time out to socialize , going back to the spirit of what brought them together : friendship			0
" it 's about the money but also more than that , " says @entity83			0
" we know each other ; we know each other 's family and what goes on in each of our lives , " she adds			0
now men are also forming their own groups or joining mixed - groups			1
but the women of the @entity147 say they 're a long way from allowing the men in			2
" we made a deliberate decision that it would be a woman 's group " , says @entity83 , " just the dynamics of not mixing with men on that space			0
" " it 's our space , " she adds with a laugh .			0
