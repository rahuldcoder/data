@entity0 -- some " @entity5 " demonstrators who 've clashed with police in @entity4 have migrated south as the new year begins , joining their colleagues in the nation 's capital where authorities continue to allow protest camps at two locations			1
" we 're here because we got pushed out of @entity4 , but we 're also here because this is the heart of where all politics happen , " said a protester who would not give his name			2
" police know me , " he explained , as he tried to repair a tarp torn free by high winds early monday			2
he said he has been joined by a handful of other @entity23 demonstrators pushed out by @entity4 police			1
on @entity26 , @entity4 police arrested 68 @entity23 demonstrators at their longtime camp in @entity29			1
the young man , who said he left the @entity23 location weeks ago after authorities began to pressure protesters to leave , reflected on a strategy for the new year as he spoke monday at the larger of two encampments in @entity0 -- at a small downtown park known as @entity37 , near the @entity38			1
" i think ( the movement 's ) most important stage right now is to inform the @entity42 people , before we can give any kind of particular answer or one message , " he said			2
" this is still , relatively , in my opinion , a young movement , and i do n't think it 's so much that it 's anybody having the same answers but everybody asking the same questions right now , " he told @entity1 , speaking on camera with most of his face concealed by a heavy winter scarf			1
among the questions being asked include those from a ranking @entity42 congressman , rep. @entity58 , @entity59 , demanding to know why protesters have been allowed to make camp in the first place			1
@entity58 , in a letter two weeks ago to the @entity42 @entity64 , said he believes the camping is illegal			2
but the @entity66 , which is in charge of @entity37 , has applied the most liberal interpretation of rules against overnight camping , and officials instead consider the makeshift tent city a " 24 - hour vigil			0
a handwritten bulletin board maintained by the protesters monday noted it is " day 93 " of the demonstration there			0
at a second location in @entity0 , known as @entity78 , the @entity66 in recent days extended a required permit through the end of february , acting just before it was to expire on @entity82			1
the extension may further provoke @entity58 , who chairs a @entity38 panel on government reform			0
his december 13 letter to interior secretary @entity87 expressed concern that the tent city in @entity37 has ruined some of a $ 400,000 restoration project at the park , paid for with economic stimulus money			0
@entity58 said the @entity66 has allowed " the @entity95 movement to ecologically damage the park significantly over the past two months , by camping and killing the newly planted grass " at the location			0
protest organizers and supporters have distributed straw around the tents to deal with mud that followed heavy rains last month			0
other areas where grass remains now show signs of damage from the tents and tarps blocking sunlight			0
@entity66 spokeswoman @entity112 told @entity1 the protesters in @entity37 do not require a permit because their group contains fewer than 500 people and is considered a 24 - hour vigil			1
police in the area have said their enforcement so far has been to keep city streets clear of protesters , and to respond to petty crime that may take place around the camps			0
@entity1 's @entity126 contributed to this report .			0
