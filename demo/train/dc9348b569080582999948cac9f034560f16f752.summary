-- the @entity1 tuesday urged the tiny @entity3 country of @entity4 to refrain from executing 39 more death - row inmates , after nine others were recently put to death			1
" i strongly condemn the executions that took place last week in the @entity4 , and call for a halt to further executions , " said @entity8 , the @entity1 special rapporteur on extrajudicial , summary or arbitrary executions			1
" this stream of executions is a major step backwards for the country , and for the protection of the right to life in the world as a whole			1
" the country once had been at the forefront in the region 's efforts to abolish in law and practice the death penalty , with a moratorium on the death penalty for 27 years and the abolition of capital punishment for drug offenses in april 2011 , @entity8 said			2
in fact , the sliver of a nation -- surrounded by @entity38 and bordering the @entity39 -- had last executed a prisoner about 30 years ago			1
but president @entity42 announced the new execution policy in a speech on state media sunday that was rebroadcast monday			0
" all punishments prescribed by law will be maintained in the country to ensure that criminals get what they deserve : that is , that those who kill are killed , " he said			0
" by the middle of next month , all the death sentences would have been carried out to the letter			0
" citing what it deemed " reliable sources , " @entity55 reported in a statement that eight men and one woman were taken from their prison cells thursday and killed			0
three of those allegedly executed had been sentenced for treason , and two of the nine were @entity38 , said the group			1
@entity42 took power in a military coup in 1994 and was elected president two years later			0
@entity4 's human rights record has drawn steady criticism since his election , but the president has won supporters by building new hospitals , schools and other infrastructure			1
@entity8 said the executions " undermine previous steps towards the abolition of capital punishment in the @entity4			2
" " i am concerned that death sentences were imposed in violation of major international standards , including the most serious crimes provisions			2
according to available evidence , the trials did not meet due process safeguards , " @entity8 said			0
" the executions were carried out in secrecy , away from the public and from the families , and do not meet the requirements of transparency			0

the executions are a " major step backwards , " a @entity1 official says
the @entity4 president wants all death - row inmates to be executed by *mid-september*
