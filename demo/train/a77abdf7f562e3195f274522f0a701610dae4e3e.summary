-- this week , as we mark the 13th anniversary of horrific attacks on our home soil , @entity1 should have no illusions about the terrorists who have repeatedly declared their intent to strike @entity1 again			0
we know the threat of the vicious terrorist organization known as @entity11 has concerned the intelligence community for more than a year			1
and the group 's atrocities have been well - documented since it began attacking northern @entity15 , and it is deeply concerning that it has taken president @entity16 so long to develop any kind of strategy to address these increasingly powerful terrorists who have now gruesomely killed two @entity1 journalists before the world stage			1
on wednesday evening , the president will finally share with the @entity1 people his " game plan , " as he calls it , to combat @entity11			1
it is my hope that he will propose a clear plan , consistent with the @entity29 , to keep @entity1 safe , and that it is not laden with impractical contingencies , such as resolving the @entity33 civil war , reaching political reconciliation in @entity15 or achieving " consensus " in the international community			1
analysis : @entity16 speech a do - over on ' no strategy ' comment there are three specific steps that should be taken			1
first and foremost , @entity44 should resolve to make border security a top priority finally , rather than an afterthought , of this plan in light of concerns about potential @entity11 activities on our southern border , cited in a @entity55 bulletin reported by @entity56			1
as long as our border is n't secure , the government is making it far too easy for terrorists to infiltrate our nation			2
second , @entity62 should make fighting for or supporting @entity11 an affirmative renunciation of @entity1 citizenship			1
numerous @entity1 have joined isis along with hundreds of others from the @entity66			0
we know that some of them are trying to return to their countries of origin to carry out terrorist attacks			0
how do we know that ? it 's already been attempted			0
on may 24 , a suspected @entity75 jihadist with possible @entity11 ties traveled to @entity77 , where he is accused of attacking innocent visitors at the @entity79 of @entity77 in @entity80 and slaughtering four people -- and it was reported earlier this week that he allegedly had been plotting a larger attack on @entity83 on @entity84			1
in august , an accused @entity11 sympathizer , @entity85 , was arrested at @entity86 in @entity87 trying to re-enter the @entity1			1
on monday i filed the @entity89 of 2014 , which would amend the existing statute governing renunciation of @entity1 citizenship to include fighting for a hostile foreign government or foreign terrorist organization as an affirmative renunciation of citizenship			0
by fighting for @entity11 , @entity1 citizens have expressed their desire to become citizens of the terrorist group , which calls itself the @entity101			1
we should not permit them to return to @entity1 , with a @entity1 passport , to carry out acts of terror at home			0
it is my hope that this legislation will attract bipartisan support , and will bring @entity44 together with one united voice in support of keeping @entity1 safe from @entity11 acts of terror			2
third , we should do everything possible to make @entity11 understand there are serious ramifications for threatening to attack the @entity1 and for killing @entity1 civilians			2
while damaging @entity11 ' financial assets is certainly a part of this action , because of the very nature of @entity11 , the response must be principally military			2
we should concentrate on a coordinated and overwhelming air campaign to destroy the capability of @entity11 to carry out terrorist attacks on the @entity1			1
@entity126 : 10 questions for @entity16 on @entity11 the president 's previously stated goal -- to " shrink " @entity11 ' " sphere of influence " until it is a " manageable problem " -- is not encouraging			1
the objective should not be to make @entity11 " manageable " ; the objective should be to protect the @entity1 and to destroy the terrorists who have declared jihad on our nation			2
the @entity138 's suggested ways of countering @entity11 have , so far , been naive and ineffective			2
now , faced with the growing threat of the group , @entity1 are being told @entity33 and @entity142 may suddenly be our friends , and @entity11 is now our enemy			1
the enemy of our enemy is not always our friend			0
other possible objectives the @entity138 is considering are equally worrisome			0
we must reject the notion that any @entity1 action be contingent on political reconciliation between @entity153 and @entity154 in @entity155			0
the @entity153 and @entity154 have been engaged in a sectarian civil war since 632			0
while we all wish the @entity15 success in their most recent attempt to form a government , it is the height of hubris and ignorance to make @entity1 national security contingent on the resolution of a 1,500 - year - old religious conflict			0
likewise , any action we take to stop @entity11 should not be contingent on any consensus from the so - called international community			2
@entity16 to @entity62 : no vote needed on @entity11 strategy @entity1 is blessed to have good friends and allies who understand the threat of @entity11 , and we welcome their support			1
indeed , this is an opportunity to reverse the destructive policy of the last five years of reaching out and appeasing our enemies while giving our allies the cold shoulder			0
instead , we should partner closely with our friends in the region who are already engaged in this fight , notably @entity185 , @entity186 and the @entity187			0
this mission must be led by the @entity1 if it is to be done right , and we can not make the assembling of a coalition a higher priority than the execution of our mission			0
national security hawks call for airstrikes targeting @entity11 leaders and , leading that mission requires a clear articulation of the mission			1
finally , the president appears to have ruled out making any formal authorization request from @entity62 to take military action			0
i ask the president to reconsider			0
only @entity62 has the authority to declare war			0
while our commander in chief has constitutional authority to respond to an imminent danger , @entity16 has not suggested that is the case			2
he is reportedly planning a mission that could last as long as three years and may require a range of actions			0
therefore , congressional authorization is required by the @entity29			1
making this formal request would provide the president with an opportunity to present the @entity1 people with a clearly defined military objective , tethered to national security , to protect our nation and to unite everyone in the mission to eradicate @entity11 .			1

sen. @entity225 : americans who join @entity11 should be *stripped* of citizenship
he says @entity11 threat is a reason to increase border security
cruz : @entity16 should seek congressional authorization for campaign *vs.* @entity11
the idea of partnering with @entity142 or @entity33 against @entity11 would be a mistake , he says
