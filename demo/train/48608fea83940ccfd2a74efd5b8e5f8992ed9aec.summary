-- as college seniors across the country prepare to graduate , from the excitement over spring and looming freedom rises the familiar worry : will i get a job ? will i get a job i actually want ? the answer to both , it seems , is a resounding , if utterly inconclusive , maybe			1
a few weeks back , the @entity15 @entity14 announced that while the job market is getting better -- unemployment among 2013 graduates is at 10.9 % , down from 13 % for recent graduates in 2012 -- it 's still weaker than it was prerecession			1
what 's more , those who are working have increasingly settled for jobs outside their fields of study or for less pay than they 'd expected			2
some 260,000 college graduates were stuck last year working at or below the federal minimum wage of $ 7.25 an hour , more than double the numbers of minimum wage - earning college grads in 2007			1
a friend 's daughter graduating this week from @entity35 with dual honors degrees in sociology and math and four years of experience working in sexual assault advocacy on campus will be spending the summer working at her local @entity42 -- and readying grad school applications -- after a number of dead - end interviews with women 's rights groups			1
" and i feel grateful , " she told me			0
there is good news , however			0
while many pregraduates still express feeling a certain pressure to make the " right " decisions early on to make the most out of every moment working in such a competitive professional atmosphere , the truth is that the job you take tomorrow , next week or even next year does not have to set the tone for your professional career			2
at a recent talk i gave to a writing workshop that a friend teaches at an @entity65 university , the students had one big concern : how to avoid being " pigeonholed " if you 're forced to take a first job that 's less than your ideal			1
while the @entity69 does not track lifetime careers -- and no one really knows where the old statistic that people average seven job changes over the course of a lifetime came from -- studies do show that job tenure has slowly but consistently been in decline over the past few decades			2
job - hopping is now the new norm -- and while it 's especially so during a person 's early working years , it 's pretty common in general			1
numbers from the @entity69 show that most workers is the @entity15 have been at their job for under a year , and that the average length of time anyone spends at any given job is 4.4 years			1
@entity91 , a friend of my daughter 's , graduated from her @entity95 school two years ago			2
she imagined a career in magazine publishing -- she really wanted to be a beauty editor -- but ended up in finance instead			0
the money is good , and the job is fine , but it 's not her passion			1
and so she has an end date in sight			0
" i 'm going to put in one more year and ' save up ' for an unpaid internship in 2015 , " she told me			0
" i do n't mind starting from the beginning , if it 's something i really want to do			0
" a 2013 poll by consulting firm @entity111 proves how quickly career plans can change once graduates enter the " real world			0
" in a study of 1,000 graduating seniors and 1,000 recent graduates , 18 % of pending 2013 graduates planned to get a graduate degree			1
by contrast , that number increased to 42 % among working graduates			0
some 15 % of pregrads expected to earn less than $ 25,000 a year			0
the number of those who ended up with that salary or less ? 33 %			0
college graduates are getting the message that planning too far ahead is an exercise in futility and perhaps limiting in itself			1
a survey conducted last year by @entity133 found that 91 % of millennials expect to stay in a job for less than three years ( which could , in fact , add up to 15 to 20 jobs over the course of a lifetime )			0
and according to the @entity111 poll , while 53 % of graduates found full - time jobs in their field of study , 34 % said they were willing to take the first job they were offered			1
the truth is that most college graduates do not start out in their desired field , and endless life decisions will influence the path a college graduate 's career takes over the next 40 or so years			1
a 2013 study conducted by @entity156 found that 41 % of graduates from top universities -- the presumably best and brightest -- could not land jobs in their chosen field after graduation			2
in other words , it 's tough out there			0
the benefit to that , of course , is more time , even if forced , to explore a variety of areas of interest while feeling safe in the knowledge that there continue to be more job opportunities for those with a college education than for those without			2
which is why the best thing graduating seniors can do as they approach the working world may be to keep an open mind and chill out a bit			0
and recognize that life -- personally and professionally -- demands a willingness to change			0
because if there 's a constant in the ever - in - flux job economy , it 's that adaptability and flexibility are key to survival .			1

as college seniors across the @entity15 graduate , they worry about finding a job
@entity198 : most college graduates do not start out in their desired field
she says it 's ok to take job that is not ideal for a while ; job - hopping is normal
@entity198 : if there 's a new constant , it 's that adaptability and flexibility are key to survival
