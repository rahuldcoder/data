" the @entity13 insult generated 11,000 comments and 50,000 likes			2
so @entity3 posted some not - so - fancy tweets in response			1
they 've since been deleted			2
but hey , this is the @entity20 -- and nothing is truly gone			2
" everytime i 've ever spoken to you you 've always been nice as hell , i 'm disappointed you 'd be such an ass for no reason , " one said			0
" why would you post such a mean pic on insta when you send your body guards to ask me for pictures every time we are at shows			0
cue tuesday , when @entity2 was back with more -- some decidedly mean ones			1
he called her the b - word in one , asking her to " cool out " because he was only kidding			0
in another @entity13 post , he cranked it up a notch , threatening her			0
and , just to rub it in , he posted a side - by - side of @entity3 and @entity42 ' in - drag character from " @entity43			1
" if i 'm a ( b - word ) for asking why you are supportive to my face but another way on your @entity13 then so be it , " one tweet said			0
" post away about this ' ( b - word ) ' i 've seen all the memes the world has to offer in regards to me i honestly do n't care , " another said			0
@entity2 responded with more expletives			1
@entity3 followed with some retweets from supportive fans			2
