-- his name means " bright light " in @entity6 , and at the tender age of 18 he 's already shining on the global rugby stage			1
less than one year out of high school , @entity7 made an impressive debut at the @entity11 @entity10 last month as his native @entity12 romped to tournament victory			1
the @entity17 teenager 's pace , power and try - scoring exploits have even drawn comparisons to @entity12 rugby legend @entity20 , the rampaging winger who first appeared at the 1994 @entity23 before going on to star at the @entity24 in @entity25 one year later			1
but the softly spoken teenager -- who at 6 foot 4 inches and 227 pounds ( 103 kg ) is not quite as hulking as the giant @entity20 -- is eager to offer a @entity29 sidestep to what he sees as early career hyperbole after appearing at just two events on the international sevens circuit so far			1
" @entity20 has done great things for @entity12 and the @entity12 sevens and i do n't really like being compared to him , " @entity35 told @entity0 's @entity37 show			1
" ( @entity20 ) sort of took the world by storm			2
i 'm just a normal 18 - year - old boy making his way , nowhere near what he was when he was this age			1
" despite the glowing reviews his early performances have garnered , @entity7 feels he is still adjusting to life as a professional athlete			1
he was turning out as a back - row forward for @entity12 's school select xv as recently as last year before proving his worth for the @entity17 side at the @entity53 and @entity54			1
@entity12 sevens coach @entity55 recently described @entity7 as someone with " all the attributes and skill set of a fine rugby player , " albeit on a sharp learning curve			1
accordingly , the transition from the 15 - a - side game he excelled at in high school to the slicker , faster international sevens code has not been easy going -- not least nutritionally , with fast food now off the menu for @entity7 thanks to @entity55 ' strict regime			1
" it 's been hard coming from a 15s background , where you do n't have to be as fit as you are in sevens			0
' @entity73 ' has made me work hard , " @entity7 said			2
" back in high school i used to have pies every day , @entity75 's whenever we were out , but now with the sevens it 's a lot different			0
' @entity73 ' is always watching what we eat , getting the right food into us so we can perform on training days and on game day			0
" this new focus on diet and conditioning seems to be paying early dividends			0
@entity7 's strong debut showing in @entity89 was followed up with another solid performance at the @entity91 this past weekend ( where @entity12 finished fourth behind @entity92 , @entity25 and tournament winners @entity93 ) and he has been selected for this weekend 's prestigious @entity23			1
turning out in the @entity6 capital , however , was a special moment for @entity7 , who spent much of his early childhood in the city			2
his father @entity99 was a professional rugby player there for six years in the late 1990s and @entity7 revealed that 's where his first name comes from			1
" with dad playing in @entity6 , i sort of guess it felt right for him to give me and my brother @entity6 names			0
my name means ' bright light , ' i think , and my brother 's name is @entity111 ( after the club his father played for in @entity114 )			0
so , two @entity6 names and i guess it 's special , " he said			0
@entity7 's father also played internationally for @entity118 at the @entity119 , reaching the semifinal stage after a famous victory over @entity122			2
his mother , meanwhile , represented @entity12 's international women 's team			0
this rich rugby heritage ensures that the young @entity7 has plenty of confidantes to turn to for advice if required -- but it has n't stopped his parents from insisting he also prepares for a career outside the game as a fallback			2
" they 're proud but they also want me to have an education outside of rugby , balancing sport and study and just making sure that i do n't fall behind in classes and things like that , " said @entity7			2
" you 're only one injury away from career over and then what do you have to fall back on ? so yeah , they 're just making sure i have that and getting my priorities right as well as doing well in sevens			0
" with the @entity23 event approaching this weekend , @entity7 's focus is solely on rugby for the time being			2
he hopes to build on what he has achieved so far and cement his place in @entity55 ' plans for the remainder of the sevens season			0
" i 've enjoyed it , even though it 's hard and i 've struggled sometimes , it 's what you have to do to be a professional rugby player , " he said			0
" if you 've been picked for the team it shows that you obviously have potential			0
