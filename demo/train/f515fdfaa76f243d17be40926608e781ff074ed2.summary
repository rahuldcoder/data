" i think i felt quiet a bit of guilt , " he recalls			0

standing in front of some of the world 's most powerful men , @entity3 stopped his performance to recite a politically - charged poem , blasting the @entity156 for its failed relief mission in @entity13			1
" at this time i said what do i have to do , i have no career , nobody cares , i ca n't live with myself if i do n't say something now that i have the opportunity to address all these people of stature and political clout			0
" it was like honest in the moment			0
