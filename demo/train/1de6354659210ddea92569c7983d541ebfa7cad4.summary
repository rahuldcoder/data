-- after years of speculation and anticipation , the cast and crew of " @entity3 " are finally at work on new episodes			1
in the interim , @entity8 was n't waiting by the phone covered in blue paint , like @entity12 : he released his third comedy album in 2010 , created and starred in " @entity14 " on @entity15 and guest - starred on " @entity16			1
" @entity8 took the time to talk to @entity0 about the return of the cult favorite			1
it 's been almost ten years since the show started			1
i never really thought of it that way			1
i do n't know of any project that 's had a shelf life [ like this ]			1
it was about a four - and - a - half year window of people thinking , " ok , it might be any month now that it starts			1
" you know , " next month ? next year			2
next year ? next two months			2
" and that process was four years , so it seems very present			2
that whole part was longer than actually shooting			2
how does it feel to be back in the cutoffs ? well , the cutoffs themselves are great , because that first day of shooting we were in @entity43 , and it was 102 degrees			1
it was a treat to be in the cutoffs			2
it 's great , and it 's a little surreal			1
i would say about half of the crew is back , the same crew from six years ago			2
we 're all older and people are married , have kids now			2
there 's no good way to do it			2
you 're not gon na sit around on set and shoot the s * * * for three hours and catch up			2
you just get there at 6:30 in the morning and go			0
and you know , an hour - and - a - half later you 're in front of the camera doing your first scene			0
' @entity65 : the @entity66 is a 10 - episode season still the plan ? i think it 's going to be 13 episodes , not 10			1
there 's too much story			0
some characters will have two - parters			0
everybody sort of participates , sometimes in a bigger way and sometimes in a tiny little thread that goes through everybody else 's stories			0
is the new season going to be more serialized , like some of the later episodes ? i 'm not gon na divulge anything , but i know what the stories are and what @entity86 [ @entity87 ] is doing , and it 's so layered			1
it 's really audacious and amazing			1
i think a lot of people will miss the work that is involved , the story , the @entity96 diagrams that are being created , the domino effect that characters have with each other in their various episodes			1
i know what he 's doing , and this has never been done on a tv show like this			0
this makes " lost " look like a @entity109 monologue			0
you 'll have to watch each episode more than once			0
watch : a $ @entity113 @entity112 for the ' @entity114 ' on ' @entity115 ' do you think the return of " ad " and the possible " @entity118 " movie and the campaign to save " @entity120 " have happened because fans have the @entity122 , or something else ? the networks finally caught up to the understanding of how people watch tv			1
if it was one year later , " @entity3 " would still be on the air			1
or , not currently , but it would n't have gotten canceled			0
just one year ! it took them a while to figure out what everybody else already knew , which is that people are n't watching the show the night it airs			0
the new episodes are going to be released on @entity139			1
what 's it like working with them compared to a network ? @entity139 is great			1
they do n't meddle at all			0
they know what they want			0
they 're happy to have it			0
the idea of @entity150 and @entity151 and being kind of studio - or network - loyal is absurd			0
people do n't give a s * * *			0
what is it ? it 's on the plane			0
it 's on the @entity122			0
that 's how people watch tv			0
@entity170 and @entity173 support @entity171 in @entity174 a lot of people are already planning marathons and parties for the new episodes			1
i think there 's gon na be a lot of power outages across @entity184			0
i think the grid is gon na go down			0
