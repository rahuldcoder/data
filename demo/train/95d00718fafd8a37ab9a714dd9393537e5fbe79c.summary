-- @entity1 slammed @entity3 tennis chief @entity2 for his " insensitive , sexist and racist " remarks in describing her and sister @entity5 as the " @entity1 brothers " on a late night tv chat show			1
the world number one gave her first public reaction sunday to @entity2 's comments as she spoke to reporters on the eve of the @entity13 in @entity14			1
@entity2 , who has been banned by the @entity13 for a year and fined $ 25,000 , has also made a public apology , but that has clearly not satisfied 18 - time grand slam champion @entity1			1
" i think the @entity13 did a great job of taking initiative and taking immediate action to his comments			2
i thought they were very insensitive and extremely sexist as well as racist at the same time , " she said			2
@entity1 , who won the @entity26 title last month , added : " i thought they were in a way bullying			1
" but the @entity13 and the @entity29 ( @entity29 ) did a wonderful job of making sure that -- in this day of age , 2014 for someone with his power , it 's really unacceptable to make such bullying remarks			0
" @entity2 's apology , in which he suggested his remarks were a " small joke , " has also cut little ice with world number two @entity40			1
she has played in @entity3 @entity44 teams captained by @entity2 , but had little sympathy for her compatriot when asked for her reaction to the comments			1
" i think they were very disrespectful and uncalled for , and i 'm glad that many people have stood up , including the @entity13 , " she said			0
" it was very inappropriate , especially in his position and all the responsibilities that he has not just in sport , but being part of the @entity58 committee			0
it was just really irresponsible on his side			0
" the controversy has been an unwelcome distraction ahead of the prestigious end of season finals , where @entity1 is bidding for a third straight title			1
she opens against former world number one @entity68 monday , hoping to shrug off injury and illness scares from her two previous tournaments in @entity73			0
" i was n't sure if i would be able to make it to this tournament , " she admitted			0
" but i 'm here , and i 'm really -- i feel better than i did obviously in @entity73			0
i am just getting better every day hopefully			0
" on the men 's @entity80 , the race to secure a place in its eight - man @entity13 in @entity79 next month is hotting up			1
@entity83 's @entity82 improved his chances of claiming one of the three remaining spots available by beating @entity88 's @entity87 5 - 7 6 - 2 7 - 5 to win the @entity89 in @entity90			1
it 's the 30th career title for @entity82 , who has gone above @entity87 in the standings			2
both will now play in @entity94 next week			0
top seed @entity95 also did his cause no harm by beating defending champion @entity99 5 - 7 6 - 4 6 - 4 to claim the @entity101 title sunday			2
the @entity102 is now seventh , just ahead of @entity82 in the qualifying battle , while defeat damages the hopes of @entity106 's @entity99 , who was seeking his fourth title of the year			2
@entity26 @entity108 , who has already booked his place at @entity79 , won the @entity111 tournament , beating @entity113 @entity112 in straight sets			0
@entity2 is chairman of the annual event in the @entity3 capital @entity117 , and after his remarks about the @entity1 sisters , the @entity13 is demanding he stands down from that position .			1
