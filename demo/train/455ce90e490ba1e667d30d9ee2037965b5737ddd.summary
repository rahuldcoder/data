-- the same hands that are helping @entity2 recover from a massive earthquake could cripple its long - term recovery			1
that 's the concern voiced by some @entity2 scholars , natives and relief workers			1
the world has rallied to @entity2 's side since the january 12 earthquake killed at least 217,000 people and displaced at least a million in the impoverished island nation			1
yet the same groups that have lined up to help @entity2 the past two months -- foreign governments , relief groups and companies pledging to rebuild -- could hobble @entity2 's long - term survival , some say			1
@entity21 , a @entity22 , says he 's grateful for the world 's assistance			0
but he does n't want the earthquake to wipe out one of his native country 's most precious assets : its independence			1
" we 're not a country anymore , " said @entity21 , a former top - ranked professional tennis player			1
" it does n't seem like we have a government			0
we 're a place where people go to give money			0
" how aid can hinder @entity2 's government much of @entity2 's national identity is shaped around its unique history			1
@entity2 are the descendants of the only slaves who revolted against their masters in the 19th century			2
@entity2 , though , has struggled since it broke away from its colonial rulers , the @entity45			2
even before the earthquake , unemployment hovered around 50 percent , and more than half of all @entity2 live on a dollar a day			2
ongoing political instability adds to @entity2 's misery			1
western nations and relief groups have stepped in over the years to help			0
but some of that help has backfired , says @entity56 , a native of @entity2 and a professor of sociology at @entity59 in @entity60			1
" @entity2 has been transformed over the years into an aid - dependent country , " @entity56 said			1
" much of the aid has further weakened the ability of the state to deliver			2
" in @entity2 , the government does n't provide basic services such as sanitation , electricity and drinking water , @entity56 says			1
much of that is provided by non-governmental organizations , or @entity72 , like relief groups , he says			0
" it becomes a vicious cycle , " @entity56 said			0
" the state is never forced to face up to its responsibilities			0
" educated @entity2 could stay and help their country , but many prefer to move elsewhere for more comfortable living , @entity56 says			1
" there are more @entity2 doctors practicing medicine in @entity84 than in @entity2 , " @entity56 said			2
full earthquake coverage those educated @entity2 who do stay are often siphoned off into working for the non-governmental organizations stationed there , says @entity89 @entity88 , an urban studies professor at the @entity90 who has traveled to disaster zones around the world to help communities recover			1
@entity88 says there are about 10,000 ngos in @entity2			2
" @entity2 often do n't want to work for the government , because the salaries ca n't compete with the donations various intermediaries can pay , " @entity88 said			1
profiting from @entity2 's misery helping hands have hurt @entity2 in the past , some @entity2 say			1
powerful outsiders took advantage of @entity2 's weakened government for profit			1
@entity56 says that in the early 1970s , @entity2 was self - sufficient in its rice production			2
today , it is the fourth largest importer of rice from @entity110 farmers who are subsidized by the @entity110 government			0
the change came about because much of the foreign aid to @entity2 had strings attached			1
@entity2 had to remove its tariffs and open its economy to foreign imports , he says			2
" all of which had devastating impacts on @entity2 agriculture , " @entity56 said			2
" @entity2 has nothing to show for it			2
now it imports 25 percent of the food it consumes			0
" @entity2 's impoverished condition also provides opportunity for companies that flock to the country			1
" it 's being used as a haven for cheap labor in the textiles and garment industries , " @entity56 says			0
" those industries are going to @entity2 because there is an abundance of the cheapest labor in the @entity136			2
" even those companies that promise to help rebuild @entity2 must be viewed with suspicion , one scholar says			2
@entity2 's recovery could be hampered by unscrupulous outsiders and opportunistic @entity2 who may seize land for themselves by passing their efforts off as " helping the recovery , " @entity88 said			1
after @entity144 wiped out the @entity145 in @entity146 , @entity147 , a group of developers proposed turning the area into a golf course , @entity88 says			0
after the 2004 @entity154 tsunami , developers proposed building luxury hotels on the fishing communities that had just been wiped out , he added			0
the same pattern could repeat itself in @entity158 , the capital , to " redevelop " @entity2 , @entity88 says			2
" everywhere i 've worked , where there 's been a disaster , there 's been land grabs by the elite , " @entity88 said			1
@entity2 say how their country can recover @entity2 can come out of this disaster stronger if they take more control of their destiny , @entity88 says			1
@entity88 suggests that @entity2 create a social investment fund , which would be used to funnel money that expatriates send to their homeland into investments in renewable energy , education and housing			0
it 's been estimated that up to 36 percent of @entity2 's gross national product comes from remittances , or money @entity2 receive from other @entity2 abroad			1
" because @entity2 are investing in @entity2 , they are going to make sure no one is ripped off , " @entity88 said of the investment fund			0
@entity183 , the @entity2 - @entity110 tennis player , recommends an even more subtle change for improving his country 's prospects : teach more @entity188 to @entity2 youth			1
@entity190 and @entity45 are the primary languages in @entity2			0
but the best employment opportunities for @entity2 rest about an hour 's flight away in the @entity110 , where @entity188 is the main language , @entity21 says			1
" we have a @entity45 culture , but we 're so close to @entity110 , " said @entity21 , who now lives in @entity195 , @entity196			0
" when @entity2 go to @entity110 , they do n't speak @entity188			0
they ca n't go to college			0
when other @entity188 - speaking islanders go to @entity110 , 80 percent of the job is done			0
" relief groups can help @entity2 in the short term by not only providing food , shelter and water but by hiring @entity2 workers in reconstruction projects and soliciting their advice , one relief expert says			0
" there 's nothing worse than a bunch of foreigners coming in to fix everything , " said @entity212 , a spokesman for @entity213 , a humanitarian organization that is in @entity2			1
" self - esteem and buy - in are very important for any community			0
they need to say , ' this is our building , our hospital			0
' " @entity225 : @entity2 's missing and found local input can also avoid wasting precious resources , @entity212 says			1
" you can build a hospital , but if there 's no functional road to it , it 's a white elephant , " @entity212 said			0
" people will despise it			0
go in the community , get their input and employ them			0
" despite the challenges ahead , some @entity2 remain optimistic			0
news accounts of the earthquake 's aftermath are filled with stories about the resilience of @entity2 people			1
@entity245 , a @entity2 native who is communications director for @entity246 , an international @entity247 humanitarian agency , says the street vendors and the colorful tap - tap taxicabs have returned to the streets of @entity158			0
" given our history as the first black republic , " @entity245 said , " this has left us with the sense that we are good , we can win , and we can go forward			0

massive aid flowing into @entity2 could hobble country 's recovery , some say
aid weakens ability of @entity2 government to develop , sociologist says
" we 're not a country anymore , " one @entity2 says
powerful outsiders can use crisis for land grabs , professor says
