officials in @entity1 said monday they would grant consular access to the @entity4 - held suspect in an alleged @entity6 plot to assassinate the @entity8 ambassador to the @entity4			1
@entity10 spokesman @entity9 said officials do not believe the suspect , @entity12 , 56 , is entitled to consular visits because he is a dual @entity4 - @entity6 citizen			1
but the agency has long encouraged authorities to allow consular visits in such cases and would do so this time , he said			0
earlier , a senior administration official said monday the @entity4 will grant access if @entity6 formally requests it			1
the @entity20 posted a statement to its website sunday saying that it had given a note demanding access to @entity26			0
but @entity9 said that it did not appear that the request had been received yet			0
@entity4 officials arrested @entity12 last week on suspicion that he conspired with an @entity6 - based member of the @entity31 to hire hit men from a @entity34 drug cartel to set off a bomb next year at a restaurant to be visited by @entity37 , the @entity8 ambassador			1
the @entity20 said the accusations were baseless and called for access to the suspect			2
" @entity6 's @entity20 reiterated that any delay by the @entity4 in facilitating consular contact with the @entity6 national would be contrary to the logic of international law and the @entity4 ' obligations , " the @entity20 said			1
the @entity4 alleges individuals in the @entity6 government knew about the plot			1
foreign minister @entity50 has said @entity6 is willing to look at evidence in the plot			1
" we are prepared to consider any issue , even if it is falsely created , with patience			0
we have asked the @entity4 to provide us with the relevant information regarding this scenario , " he told the @entity57			1
the @entity10 said last week there had been direct contact with @entity6 about the alleged plot , but a senior @entity6 official denied it			1
two @entity10 officials said @entity65 , @entity4 ambassador to the @entity66 , met with @entity67 , @entity6 's permanent representative to the @entity66			1
but the @entity6 mission in @entity69 denied it			2
" there were no kinds of negotiations between the two countries , and there was not such a contact , " said @entity70 , press secretary for the @entity6 mission to the @entity66			2
@entity50 said monday the @entity4 allegations were aimed at creating discord between states in the region			1
and he asserted that @entity6 had never been involved in terrorist operations , the @entity57 said			0
@entity50 's apparent willingness to look at evidence of the plot comes in stark contrast to the response of the country 's supreme leader			2
ayatollah @entity90 called the allegations " meaningless and absurd " in his first public reaction to alleged plot			2
" they ( the @entity4 ) want to isolate @entity6 , " @entity90 said over chants of " @entity95 " in a speech saturday before thousands in @entity98 , @entity6			1
the alleged scheme involved a connection to the @entity101 , a branch of the @entity31 , which formally answers to @entity90			0
@entity102 , an @entity6 - based member of @entity6 's @entity31 , is also accused in the alleged hit			2
authorities developed the case against the suspects with the help of an undercover informant posing as an associate of a @entity34 drug cartel , according to officials and an @entity114 agent 's affidavit			0
@entity115 , a religious scholar and author , told @entity117 on saturday that the described plot does n't fit the @entity101 's modus operandi			0
using a drug cartel would be risky and a @entity101 agent would be more reliable than @entity122 , a used - car salesman in @entity123 , he said			0
it 's uncharacteristic , " @entity115 said			0
" it really does not serve @entity6 's interest in any legitimate way			0
" @entity6 could more easily target @entity8 diplomats in the @entity130 , @entity131 and elsewhere , @entity115 said			0
" doing so on @entity4 soil is unmistakably an attack on the @entity4 , not on @entity8			0

@entity6 demands access to the man arrested in the alleged assassination plot
foreign minister @entity50 says @entity6 has asked the @entity4 for information about allegations
