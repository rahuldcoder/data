" what is prince @entity1 like ? " it 's a question i often get asked , and in this interview i think people will , for the first time , get a real sense of his character			1
i would love to say it was purely down to me , but it probably has more to do with the moment			0
@entity1 was less than two weeks into parenthood when i spoke to him			1
he was tired , elated and still grappling with how he 'd changed since becoming a father			1
i could sense how he had been consumed by his new way of life -- i 've been there myself and other fathers will pick up on it too			0
he may be a prince but he 's doing it the old - fashioned ( non-royal ) way			1
he and his wife are the ones getting up at night and changing the nappies / diapers			0
@entity1 was the one who , outside the hospital , fixed his son 's car seat in , then drove home for the first time with his new family			1
he 's a royal duke and he has people who can do all these things for him , but he 's doing it himself			1
as a result , this heir to the throne has been given a rare insight into what it 's like to be ordinary , and we 're able to connect with him			2
i met @entity1 at @entity43			1
i had been chasing an interview with him for more than two years , so i was n't there by chance , but in the end it all felt quite informal and relaxed			1
it was almost as if we had bumped into each other as we both walked into a room at the same time			0
we started chatting , he was on great form and i knew immediately that he was going to give a great interview			2
the plan was to discuss @entity55 conservation and specifically a new award scheme organized by one of his charities , the @entity58			0
inevitably we ended up chatting about fatherhood as well			0
the conversation continued as we walked out of the main building , past the small cottage he 's currently occupying with his family and into their walled garden where the interview would take place			1
the duke only had his press secretary with him and neither of them raised any notable questions or concerns			0
in fact before i knew it , the cameras were rolling and the interview was under way			2
i had decided not to rely on notes and just have a conversation			0
@entity1 was very comfortable and revealing about his conservation work , and i ca n't wait for people to see the full version of the interview in next month 's special			1
the subject of @entity88 came up several times during the discussion about conservation , and his father was happy to talk about his son in his own right too			2
i was struck by how he had what felt like a particularly tight family unit			0
it was the way he said : " for me , @entity97 , and now little @entity98 are my priorities ... and @entity100 ( the dog )			0
" i also thought it was interesting that he is n't sending out a message about modern monarchy in the way that he 's handling things , he 's just doing it his own way , being himself			2
it could be any new dad , and that 's what i like about the interview			1
his honesty even stretched to admitting he 's looking forward to going back to work ... something other new dads will relate to , but perhaps wo n't admit quite as easily			0
there 's more next month when we air what 's set to be a stunning documentary .			0
