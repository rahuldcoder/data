documents show @entity36 denied repeated requests for additional security in @entity11			2
veteran diplomat @entity48 , who was chairman of the review board , said the members placed primary blame " at the assistant secretary level , which is in our view the appropriate place to look , where the decision making , in fact , takes place			0
where , if you like , the rubber hits the road			0
" secretary of state @entity61 , who was recovering from a stomach virus and concussion , ordered the review in the aftermath of the attack			0
such reports are mandated by @entity43 when @entity8 working on behalf of the @entity8 government are killed overseas			0

sen. @entity101 , @entity102 , who is considered the top prospect for the secretary of state job being vacated by @entity72 , said the @entity3 " has taken a huge step forward to address the lessons learned from @entity10			1
" " it 's a dangerous world we 're in , and i think that this report is going to significantly advance the security interests of those personnel and of our country , " @entity101 told reporters wednesday			2
@entity115 's letter to sen. @entity101 a @entity1 / @entity118 poll conducted monday and tuesday suggests most @entity8 are dissatisfied with how the @entity120 administration has handled the aftermath of the attack , but a majority believe that the administration did not attempt to intentionally mislead the @entity8 public about that attack			1
four in 10 @entity8 believe that inaccurate statements by administration officials after the @entity10 attack were intended to mislead the public , while 56 % said they thought those statements reflected what the @entity120 administration believed to be true at the time			1
in all , 43 % said they are satisfied with the way the @entity120 administration has handled the matter in the past few months ; half said they are dissatisfied			1
the review board cited a lack of resources as at least partly to blame for the deaths in @entity10			2
" the solution requires a more serious and sustained commitment from @entity43 to support @entity3 needs , " it said			2
the board found that @entity0 tended " to overemphasize the positive impact of physical security upgrades ... while generally failing to meet @entity10 's repeated requests " to beef up personnel			1
the board completed its investigation this week and sent a copy monday to @entity72 , who said in letters to the heads of the foreign affairs and @entity154 that she accepted all of its 29 recommendations			0
they include strengthening security , adding fire - safety precautions and improving intelligence collection in high - threat areas			0
the report says " there was no protest prior to the attacks , " which were described as " unanticipated in their scale and intensity			0
" it also cites the @entity172 staff as " inadequate " in @entity10 on the day of the attacks and in the months and weeks leading up to it , " despite repeated requests from @entity10 and @entity175 for additional staffing			2
" the report says there had been a " lack of transparency , responsiveness , and leadership at the senior levels " in @entity0 , @entity184 and @entity10			1
@entity1 poll : majority dissatisfied but do n't think administration misled on @entity10 attack " security in @entity10 was not recognized and implemented as a ' shared responsibility ' by the bureaus in @entity0 charged with supporting the post , resulting in stove - piped discussions and decisions on policy and security , " it says			1
" that said , @entity175 did not demonstrate strong and sustained advocacy with @entity0 for increased security for @entity200			0
" the report says the short - term nature of the mission 's staff , many of whom were inexperienced @entity8 personnel , " resulted in diminished institutional knowledge , continuity and mission capacity			0
" the mission was also " severely under - resourced with regard to certain needed security equipment , " it says			0
it singles out for criticism dependence on " poorly skilled " members of the @entity11 february 17 @entity217 and unarmed local guards who were supposed to provide security			0
it noted that , at the time of @entity30 ' visit , militia members " had stopped accompanying special mission vehicle movements in protest over salary and working hours			0
" though it said there had been no specific , credible threats on the day of the attack , the significance of the anniversary of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 had led @entity30 to hold meetings on the compound on september 11 of this year			0
but security systems and the @entity11 response " fell short " when the compound was penetrated " by dozens of armed attackers			0
" the report presents a detailed description of what happened that night			0
it says @entity11 mission guards were not present , local militia fled their posts and " there simply was not enough time for armed @entity8 military assets to have made a difference			0
" the board said it could not determine how a gate at the compound was breached , " but the speed with which attackers entered raised the possibility " that the guards had left it open			0
the politics surrounding the events that led to the report have claimed one political casualty , with @entity260 , @entity8 ambassador to the @entity261 , last week pulling her name from consideration to succeed @entity72			0
some @entity92 senators had said they would put a hold on her nomination if president @entity120 had submitted it , based on comments , later determined to have been inaccurate , that @entity269 made in the days after the attack			2
@entity10 problems suggest long list of changes for security of diplomats @entity1 's @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			1
