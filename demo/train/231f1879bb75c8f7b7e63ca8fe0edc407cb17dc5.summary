-- the retro , rounded tv icon was one of the first to grace the @entity5 's screen when the device was released in 2007			2
now , for the first time , new @entity5 will no longer include the @entity9 app by default			1
but @entity9 has already whipped up a replacement			0
on tuesday , @entity9 released its own app for the @entity5			1
the release comes just one month after @entity14 publicly confirmed it would no longer include the popular video - site 's app on the upcoming version of its mobile operating system , @entity19 6			1
being a pre-installed , native app on iphones and @entity22 has given @entity9 instant access to a fast - growing segment of users -- @entity9 gets 1 billion mobile views each day across all platforms , and mobile now makes up 25 % of all @entity9 views			1
check out the world 's hottest smartphones but the deal with @entity14 has not been without its drawbacks			0
because the app was built by @entity14 and baked into the @entity19 mobile operating system , @entity9 had limited control over what it could change and control in the app. perhaps most importantly , it could n't show videos with ads because @entity14 did n't allow it			1
this new app gives control back to @entity9 , but at a cost			2
to avoid hemorrhaging @entity5 users who upgrade to @entity47 , or who buy a new phone with the new operating system pre-installed , the company must convince @entity5 owners to stick with @entity9 either by downloading the new app or visiting the mobile version of @entity9			1
how smartphones make us superhuman when the news of @entity14 dropping the @entity9 app came out in august , it was seen as the latest sign of strife between @entity14 and @entity60 , which owns @entity9			1
in june , @entity14 announced it would no longer use @entity61 to power the @entity5 and @entity22 's @entity63 app , and @entity14 has been taking on makers of @entity66 - powered smartphones in courts around the world over patent disputes			1
the removal of @entity9 was considered the latest attempt by @entity14 to extricate itself from @entity60 's products and services			2
@entity9 is playing down the adversarial plot line			0
" @entity14 and us have been working very closely on this one , " @entity75 , @entity9 's lead mobile product manager , told @entity0			2
" [ this ] was the right thing to do from both companies ' standpoint			0
user experience is so much better			0
" the news was n't a complete surprise to @entity9 -- @entity75 said his team spent " months " working on the app , which means they began before the split became public			2
@entity75 gave us a tour of the app , which is available for free in the @entity91 as of tuesday			0
the app can be downloaded on @entity5 running @entity47 4.3 or later			2
visually , the new interface is vast improvement over the old version , which had begun to look dated after years of minimal updates			0
the design has been overhauled and now looks much more like the @entity66 @entity9 app , with a hidden navigation panel on the left and a number of new discovery and sharing options			1
thanks to the unblocking of videos with ads , the new app has access to " tens of thousands " of videos that were n't available in the old app , such as official music videos			0
the search tool has features familiar to users of other @entity118 apps , including auto - suggestions and voice searches			0
the app is more than just a repackaged take on the mobile site , and has features not possible on that html 5 version of @entity9 , including overlays that can be used to show close captioned videos			1
the most welcome new feature for multi-taskers is in - page playback			0
you can continuously watch a video in vertical orientation while reading the video description , leaving comments , giving the video a thumbs up or down , and checking out a list of suggested videos			0
the video even keeps playing when you bring up the navigation menu			0
the @entity9 team hopes these improvements will push @entity5 users to do something they have n't had to do before for @entity9 : download the app from @entity14 's @entity91			1
the separation with @entity14 may decrease the number of @entity5 users for a time , but it has made a vastly improved @entity9 app possible			1
and because it is now offered through the app store , the company can continue to offer updates and roll out new features at a much faster pace			0
the announcement comes just one day before a much - anticipated @entity14 press conference , at which that company is expected to unveil its latest @entity5 .			2

@entity14 will no longer include a @entity9 app by default in new versions of its mobile operating system
@entity9 has released a new @entity5 app which has a new design and can play videos with ads
while it may temporarily lose users , @entity9 gains back control over its apps design and features
