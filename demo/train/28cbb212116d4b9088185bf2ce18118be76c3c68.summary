-- when it comes to parasites , it 's all about perspective			1
you may call a lifetime of growing and feeding off another organism lazy , but we call it opportunistic			2
in fact , these life - sucking go - getters have managed to carve out some of the most ingenious survival strategies in the world			1
this snapper refused comment when asked if he still had a tongue			1
@entity17 : biting your tongue , so you do n't have to when fish mommies want to strike fear in the hearts of their misbehaving fish babies , we suspect they draw on the chilling animal savagery of the @entity17			1
as a youngster , this nasty little parasitic crustacean begins a life of terror by fighting its way through the gills of its fish host of choice , the snapper			1
once there , it attaches itself to the fish 's tongue and begins feeding on the rich blood pumping through the artery underneath			1
as the parasite grows , it drinks more blood and eventually causes the tongue to atrophy and disintegrate			1
but does the @entity49 mouth - squatter leave its fishy friend tongueless ? of course not			1
it does what any crafty parasite would do and replaces the old tongue with its own body			1
the fish is actually able to use the parasite just like a normal tongue , only it has to share all the food with its new friend			1
yes , the whole foster - tongue thing seems like a pretty nice gesture on the part of ol ' @entity49 -- until you remember there was nothing wrong with the fish 's old tongue in the first place			1
@entity72 : reasons you should n't pick up a hitchhiker if you ever have a choice between being possessed by the devil and being possessed by a @entity72 , opt for the devil -- no contest			1
a female sacculina begins life as a tiny free - floating slug in the sea , drifting around until she encounters a crab			1
when that fateful day arrives , she finds a chink in the crab 's armor ( usually an elbow or leg joint ) and thrusts a kind of hollow dagger into its body			1
after that , she ( how to put this ? ) " injects " herself into the crab , sluicing through the dagger and leaving behind a husk			2
once inside , the jellylike sacculina starts to take over			0
she grows " roots " that extend to every part of the crab 's body -- wrapping around its eyestalks and deep into its legs and arms			2
the female feeds and grows until eventually she pops out the top of the crab , and from this knobby protrusion , she will steer the @entity111 for the rest of their commingled life			0
packed full of parasite , the crab will forgo its own needs to serve those of its master			0
it wo n't molt , grow reproductive organs , or attempt to reproduce			0
it wo n't even regrow appendages , as healthy crabs can			0
rather than waste the nutrients on itself , a host crab will hobble along and continue to look for food with which to feed its parasite master			0
@entity129 : proof you need thicker skin filarial worms are the nasty little suckers you can thank for lymphatic filariasis , which , according to the @entity135 to eliminate lymphatic filariasis , is the second - leading cause of permanent and long - term disability in the world			1
( mental illness is no. 1			0
) filarial worms are round , thread - like parasites that travel from human to human via that harbinger of disease transmission , the mosquito			1
how do they make the leap of host ? in an interesting ( if scary ) example of parasite ingenuity , filarial worm embryos living underneath the skin can sense the onset of night , which is their cue to head upward to the skin 's surface in order to increase their chances of being picked up by a passing ' skeeter			1
should they get sucked up , they grow into larvae within the mosquito 's muscle fibers and then get themselves injected into new hosts			2
once they 've returned to a human home , they open up a franchise in the family business -- @entity173			0
filaria often lodge in the body 's lymphatic system , where they can inflict any number of torturous symptoms , not the least of which involves carting your genitals off to the elephantiasis clinic in a wheelbarrow			2
guinea worms : exposing parts nobody wants to see where there are guinea worms , there is @entity189 -- and that 's usually in @entity191			1
when a human consumes water contaminated with guinea worms , the little buggers infiltrate their host 's intestinal walls and commence mating			1
after conception , the males die off , and the females hang around for about a year , growing and eating			0
eventually , these slender ladies get bored and decide they need to lay some eggs			0
to do so , they make their way down the body to the lower extremities , where they bore a small hole through the skin			0
the resulting lesion begins to fester and burn , which usually leads the host to plunge his or her foot into a soothing bucket of water			0
( of course , in areas where an entire village shares a single water source , this helps spread the infection			0
) unfortunately for the sufferer , the water does n't solve the problem of having a three - foot female worm dangling its genitalia out of your foot			2
and to complicate matters , if you yank on that sucker , it 'll break apart and could cause a fatal infection			0
so how do you rid yourself of the not - so - little hitchhiker ? you go see a doctor , who -- over the course of three or four weeks -- will kindly wind the worm around a stick , inch by agonizing inch			1
not the most pleasant method , but certainly a proven one			0
this cure for a guinea worm infection has been around so long , some believe it 's where we get the snakes - around - a - staff symbol for medicine			1
@entity252 : parasite for sore eyes prepare to be dazzled			0
this parasite 's got a life cycle more mind - bending and chilling than an @entity259 film			1
leucochloridium paradoxum are a type of fluke ( a.k.a. , parasitic flatworm ) that prey on birds -- a fascinating turn of events considering they begin their lives as eggs in bird droppings			0
thus , the problem facing baby @entity252 is , " how do i get myself back into one of those feathery things ? " taking a page from @entity279 history , the infant flatworms rely on @entity281 trickery			0
first , they hang out in the droppings until a snail happens along and eats the bird dung			0
then they initiate their devious plan of action by taking up residence in the snail 's eyestalks			2
( sure , it sounds slimy and gross to us , but after a childhood spent living in bird feces , it 's a step up			2
) as they mature , the flukes become visible through the snail 's translucent skin			2
and that 's when things really get interesting			2
to a bird , this fluke - filled eyestalk looks like a caterpillar			2
so the bird devours the stalk and ends up with a bellyful of @entity252 that will , of course , lay eggs and begin the cycle again			0
meanwhile , the snail shakes its head , shops for an eye patch , and vows never to eat feces again			0
