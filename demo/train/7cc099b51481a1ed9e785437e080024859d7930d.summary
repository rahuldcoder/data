-- a statue resembling the goddess @entity3 and jewelry bearing images from @entity6 may not be objects you 'd expect to see in a museum exhibit of @entity11 art from @entity12			1
their presence among carvings of @entity16 and @entity18 deities is meant to serve as a reminder of @entity12 's oft - forgotten multicultural roots , which form the basis of a new exhibit , " the @entity23 of @entity12 : art of @entity25			1
" the show , which runs until october 30 at @entity28 's @entity27 , is the first to bring works of @entity25 art to the @entity31 since 1960			1
the pieces , on loan from museums in @entity36 and @entity37 , highlight @entity12 's history as a crossroads of cultural influences , despite present - day associations of the country as an incubator of religious extremism , museum director @entity32 said			1
" when we think of @entity12 , @entity31 might associate it with the place where @entity47 was captured , with terrorism and natural disasters , " she said			0
" but actually , it has a much longer history that dates back to an ancient culture that gives us a sense of a pluralistic tradition that was all about tolerance			0
" at its height , @entity25 encompassed present - day @entity59 in northwest @entity12 and parts of eastern @entity61 , the @entity62 , and northwest @entity18 , making it a major center of trade , commerce and the development of arts and education			2
@entity12 may be 95 % @entity69 today , but @entity70 flourished in @entity25 between the 2nd century @entity71 and 10th century @entity72 , giving rise to a distinct style of @entity11 visual art. the statue of @entity3 and a gold carving of @entity78 in the exhibit demonstrate the early influence of @entity81 in the region , which began with its conquest by @entity84			2
themes from classical roman art persisted in @entity25 art even as @entity70 began to flourish in the first century @entity72 , fostered by @entity89 trade and cross-cultural connections from the @entity91 to @entity92			0
depictions of the @entity16 and the concept of bodhisattvas , or " enlightened beings , " became the main icons of @entity99 section of the exhibition , " buddhas and @entity106 , " explores the diverse visual imagery of @entity16 and bodhisattvas in @entity25 and how it relates to the multifaceted nature of @entity70 in the region			2
a carving of a standing @entity106 bears drapery and folds reminiscent of what you might find in classical art ; another flaunts a chiseled torso reminiscent of , well , a @entity116 god , @entity107 said			0
" a number of sculptures show us the narrative of the life of @entity16 , where we see @entity16 represented as person , in symbols , footprint , but it 's his representation in human form that went on to influence art that went to @entity92 , @entity128 , @entity129 , other parts of @entity131 , " she said			0
getting the pieces to the @entity31 is a tale of bureaucracy in true form two years in the making , but the initiative never suffered from a lack of desire , @entity107 said			0
as an international team begins rebuilding two massive @entity16 statues in @entity61 destroyed by the @entity145 in 2001 , the exhibit also demonstrates @entity12 's dedication to preserving its multicultural heritage , @entity12 's representative to the @entity141 said			1
with @entity16 at its thematic core , the exhibit also highlights lessons of tolerance and humanity of enduring relevance , especially in a time when relations between the @entity31 and @entity12 are not at their best , @entity141 amabassador @entity148 said			1
" @entity16 represents a human being whose ethereal qualities were so magnified by his enormous wisdom that his values of himself , which were espoused by @entity164 and so many others , became his contributions to mankind , " said @entity148 , who was instrumental in helping secure the works on loan from the @entity158 in @entity36 and the @entity159 in @entity37			1
" this was one of the great periods of the world of fundamental equity , of human rights and so many other important principles , which are important to @entity12 and the @entity31 today , " he said			0
" we 're constantly going to strive for a better understanding of each other and a better relationship , and despite what 's happening between the @entity31 and @entity12 , there are very strong grounds for us to coexist in peaceful fashion			0
