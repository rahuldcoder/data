@entity0 -- @entity2 was just two or three days old , no one really knows for sure , when she was found abandoned in the middle of a field in @entity6			0
she was " black and blue , " says her adoptive mother , @entity7			0
her umbilical cord was still attached			0
one year later , @entity2 lives in a high - rise building in @entity0 with @entity11 parents and a four - year - old sister who is @entity13			2
she just started walking and has " seven - and - a - half " teeth , though she 's too shy to show them			2
the bright - eyed baby is one of more than 35,000 children sent from @entity19 in a surge of adoptions in the last eight years , according to adoption expert @entity22 from @entity24 in the @entity25			1
during that time , figures have risen three-fold at the same time as international adoptions from all countries have slumped to a 15 - year low , @entity22 said			1
a new report from @entity31 ( @entity32 ) entitled " @entity19 : the @entity38 for @entity39 , " says the trend indicates that receiving countries are turning " en masse " to @entity19 to meet demand for adoptive children as other options close			1
it 's a trend , they say , that needs to stop			2
" it must at all costs be discouraged			1
it should be a last resort and an exception rather than the normal recourse to solving the situation of children in difficult circumstances , as it seems to have now become , " said @entity43 , executive director of the @entity32 in a press statement			2
the group says that the lack of regulation combined with the promise of money from abroad had turned children into " commodities in the graying and increasingly amoral world of intercountry adoption			1
" " due to the illegal nature of these acts , it has been difficult to properly document them , but it is known that there have been cases of children sold by their parents , and children abducted and later trafficked or even placed for adoption because wrongly considered orphans , " said @entity72 , @entity73 on the sale of children , child prostitution and child pornography			1
children 's rights advocates are meeting in @entity79 this week to consider what needs to be done to protect the continent 's children at the @entity83 on the @entity84 ( @entity85 )			1
the @entity32 is urging @entity87 leaders to seek family - based , national solutions to care for the estimated 58 million children on the continent who have been orphaned by war , famine and disease			2
" every child should have an inalienable right to be nurtured and reared in the country and culture in which they are born , " @entity43 said			0
see also : should race be a factor in adoption ? in the eight years from 2003 to 2010 , more than half of the children adopted from @entity19 came from @entity79 ( 22,282 ) , followed by @entity19 ( 1,871 ) , @entity106 ( 1,355 ) and @entity107 ( 1,331 ) and @entity108 ( 1,118 ) , according to @entity22			1
of those , only @entity19 and @entity107 have ratified the 1993 @entity110 on the @entity111 in @entity112			1
compliance with the @entity110 typically leads to a fall in adoption from those countries as they work to satisfy demands for greater transparency , the @entity32 said			2
however , sharp increases in adoption rates from @entity122 countries exposed a " deeply troubling " trend of shifting demand , according to a second report released by the group tuesday , " @entity39 : an @entity127			1
" " demand transfers to other countries where @entity132 protections do not exist and where , all too often , the authorities are totally unprepared to cope with the sudden influx of applications and are unable to apply basic child protection safeguards , " the report said			0
among other safeguards , the convention dictates that a @entity139 must ensure that adoption is in the best interests of the child			2
only 13 -- or less than one third of -- @entity87 countries have signed the convention , according to the @entity32			0
the majority of children adopted from @entity19 go to the @entity11 or @entity148 , two of the world 's biggest receiving countries , according to @entity22			1
they 're also the two countries that have experienced the greatest falls in international adoption rates in the past year , mostly due to a drop in adoptions from @entity158 after the 2010 earthquake			1
based on current but incomplete figures , @entity22 predicts international adoption rates will fall again in 2011 , taking the total number to between 23,000 and 25,000 -- down about 50 % since 2004			1
" the general agreement is it 's an issue of supply rather than demand			2
in other words , it 's not that people do n't want to adopt from abroad			1
it means that countries are less willing to send or we decide that they are operating so poorly that we do n't want to receive them , " he said			0
any further reduction from @entity19 would put further pressure on countries still open to adoptions and create longer waiting lists for potential parents			1
" there are many frustrated singles and couples who have been approved for adoptions and are waiting longer than they expected and some are feeling as though they will never get a child , " @entity22 said			0
@entity2 's parents @entity7 and @entity187 have just embarked on what they know will be a long campaign to adopt a third child			0
it has taken the couple seven years to adopt two children and as the number of adopting countries shrinks , so do their options			1
@entity6 , @entity2 's birthplace , has temporarily suspended new adoptions while it works to implement the @entity110			2
@entity7 said she knows a lot of people who want to adopt who are now looking to @entity201 and the @entity202			0
both have recorded sharp jumps in international adoption rates in recent years , according to @entity22			1
neither has ratified the @entity110			0
@entity7 is not sure if @entity2 would have survived had she remained in the @entity6 orphanage			0
she was five months old and malnourished when they gained custody			0
" she had antibiotic - resistant salmonella poisoning in her entire body			0
her head was covered in ring worm			0
she brought home other health issues , a lot of which we 've been able to eradicate			0
she 's a healthy little girl ... now , " she said			0
as to the suggestion that the doors should be all but closed to international adoptions from @entity19 , @entity7 said it should n't matter where adoptive parents live			1
" if there 's a mum and dad and everybody knows your name and you have plenty of food and you get a great education and you 're loved , i personally do n't think it matters what country you 're in , " she said .			0
