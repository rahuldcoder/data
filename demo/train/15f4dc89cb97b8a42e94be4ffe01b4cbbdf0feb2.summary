-- the modern olympics have , in their 104 - year history , seen the setting , and breaking , of numerous world records			2
@entity6 's 1968 long jump world record held until 1991			1
most of these pass virtually unnoticed ; a few briefly make the headlines and are then forgotten ; a very few involve performances of such unique physical prowess they transcend the @entity12 in which they occur and pass into sporting folklore			2
@entity21 's barefoot marathon in 1960 , @entity19 's perfect 10 at the 1976 @entity12 , @entity15 's 200 - meter run at @entity16 in 1996 -- all belong in the latter category			0
in terms of sheer sporting achievement , however , few if any feats can compare with the record - shattering leap that won @entity26 @entity6 the long jump gold medal in @entity28 in 1968			1
before @entity6 started his run - up the world record -- held jointly by @entity30 of the @entity26 and the @entity32 's @entity31 -- stood at 27 feet 4 3/4 inches ( 8.35 meters )			1
six seconds later that record had been increased by a staggering 21 3/4 inches ( 55.25 centimeters ) , to 29 feet 2 1/2 inches ( 8.90 meters )			0
in long - jumping terms it was the equivalent of the marathon time being reduced by 30 minutes , or the 100 meters by a full second			2
no wonder @entity31 declared : " compared to this jump we are as children			0
" troubled childhood born in @entity43 in 1946 , @entity6 experienced a troubled , tragedy - filled childhood			1
he never knew his real father , his mother @entity46 died of tuberculosis when he was just eight months old and , because his stepfather was in prison at the time , he ended up being raised by his maternal grandmother			0
from an early age he became involved in @entity43 's drug and gang culture , getting himself expelled from school for hitting a teacher and serving time in a juvenile detention center			0
" for most of my childhood it was just more or less survival , " he later commented			0
" i was hanging out with thugs and the whole nine yards			0
" @entity61 offered him a way out of this spiral of violence and deprivation			1
encouraged by a series of inspirational teachers he devoted himself increasingly to athletics -- " i got off the corner and into the community center , " as he later put it -- and was soon setting city - wide , and then national records for long jump , culminating in his @entity77 team selection in 1968			2
his preparations for the @entity12 were seriously disrupted when , four months before their opening , he was suspended from his university track team for refusing to compete against @entity81 , a @entity82 college with then - segregationist policies			0
the suspension left him without a coach , and it was only when existing long - jump world record holder @entity30 agreed to coach him unofficially that he was able to resume normal training			2
once in @entity28 the six - foot three - inch ( 1.91 meters ) @entity6 very nearly did n't make it into the long jump final after fouling in two of his qualifying jumps			1
he just scraped through with his third jump , and the following day , october 18 , 1968 , lined up for the final alongside the cream of world long - jumping : @entity96 , @entity31 and @entity97 of @entity98 , holder of the @entity77 , @entity101 and @entity102 records			2
the three record - holders all fouled their first jump			0
determined to gain the psychological advantage @entity6 paused at the start of the run - up track , took a deep breath and launched himself down the approach			1
nineteen strides later he hit the board and took off , coming down again so far along the sandpit that the jump was out of the range of the electronic measuring eye and officials had to use an old - fashioned measuring tape to judge the distance			0
as the stadium waited for the result one veteran sports commentator was heard to say : " gentlemen , i believe we have just witnessed the first 28 - foot long jump in history			1
" his prediction proved to be an underestimate			0
when the official length was finally announced it turned out to be the first 29 - foot long jump in history -- 29 feet 2 1/2 inches ( 8.90 meters ) to be precise			1
@entity132 seizure reigning @entity77 champion @entity97 turned to @entity30 and said : " i ca n't go on			0
what 's the point ? " @entity6 himself was so stunned by the distance that he collapsed to the ground in what doctors later diagnosed as a cataplectic seizure brought on by nervous excitement			1
the competition continued , but the size of @entity6 's first jump made the result a foregone conclusion			1
the silver medal was eventually taken by @entity149 's @entity148 and the bronze by @entity96			0
the result sent shockwaves through the athletics world			0
although there were those who disparaged @entity6 's achievement , claiming it was assisted by @entity28 's high altitude , the fact was that all the long jump finalists were competing under the same conditions and none of them came close to @entity6 ( @entity148 's silver medal jump was 2 feet 4 inches -- 71 centimeters -- shorter )			1
it was , altitude or not , quite simply one of the greatest feats in the history of athletics , and one that turned the former @entity43 delinquent into a sporting icon			2
@entity6 himself would never again match or surpass that jump , and it was not until 23 years later that @entity175 of the @entity26 broke the record by two inches ( 5 centimeters ) at the 1991 @entity177 in @entity178			1
@entity6 was inducted into the @entity179 in 1983 , and in 1999 published his autobiography			1
it was , with some justification , titled " the man who could fly			0

long jumper , @entity6 flies into the history books in @entity28
@entity61 offered him a way out of the spiral of violence and deprivation
@entity6 was inducted into the @entity179 in 1983
