-- @entity1 is no laggard when it comes to bluster and vituperation			2
for decades , the regime has issued threats of turning @entity8 into a " sea of fire " or used choice words such as " human scum " or " political idiot " when denouncing @entity8 and @entity15 leaders			1
but even measured against such standards , @entity1 's barrage over the past month , from threatening to launch an " all - out war " to " diversified precision nuclear strike " against @entity22 , " wipe out " a @entity8 island , or hurling a sexist insult against @entity25 , @entity8 's first female elected leader , to , most recently , warning of an imminent " moment of explosion , " is quite unusual			1
and now , after saying that plans for merciless operation has been " finally examined and ratified , " @entity28 is hinting at another long - range missile launch			0
what 's going on ? first , we must assume the @entity1 leadership is not crazy or suicidal in spite of bizarre things it says and does			1
cruel , totalitarian and solipsistic the @entity39 dynasty surely is			0
but the fact that it has managed to preserve itself for more 60 years and , in the @entity42 era , in spite of the everyday existential threat of facing an immeasurably more successful @entity8 state across the border , the impoverished @entity1 has shown itself to be , if nothing else , calculating and resilient			2
opinion : @entity49 is not crazy what is @entity28 calculating ? the same it has since the end of the @entity53 60 years ago			0
the two constants in @entity1 's foreign policy are its continual calls for the withdrawal of @entity15 troops from @entity8 and blaming " @entity15 hostile policy " for the tension enveloping the @entity61			1
@entity28 sees the @entity15 commitment to the defense of @entity8 , as powerfully symbolized by the presence of @entity15 troops in the @entity8 , as the greatest impediment to its highest state task			1
as @entity1 states in the charter to its communist party , that task is to " ( en ) sure the complete victory of socialism in the northern half of the @entity1 and the accomplishment of the revolutionary goals of national liberation and the people 's democracy on the entire area of the country			2
" in plain language , that means dissolving the @entity8 government and communizing the entire @entity61 by force			2
@entity1 's frequent threats are a means to a long - term end			1
the first step is to impregnate the @entity8 public with war hysteria and the illusion that the withdrawal of @entity15 troops would lead to peace and reconciliation between the two @entity95			1
the second is to instill fear in the @entity15 public by one day demonstrating its capability to marry a nuclear warhead with an intercontinental ballistic missile with the range to hit the @entity15 @entity103			1
when that day comes , @entity22 may have second thoughts about its treaty commitment to the defense of @entity8 , @entity28 calculates			0
so far , timing seems to be in @entity28 's favor			0
over the past year , all the major powers in @entity1 's neck of the woods have undergone a leadership transition			1
moreover , in @entity114 , @entity115 and @entity116 , leadership transitions have occurred only in recent months			0
that creates a particularly appeasement - prone environment , as no newly elected leader wishes to spend political capital on a foreign policy crisis created by @entity1 when many other pressing domestic issues beckon			2
so @entity28 reckons that after ratcheting up tension as high as it can and then simply take a little step back , it can lure its richer interlocutors into returning to talks and the kind of concessionary aid worth billions of dollars we have seen in the past			0
this means the risk of @entity1 starting an all - out war is quite small , although there is always the possibility of miscalculation			1
it also means that @entity28 will most likely not just go quietly into the night after having thumped its chest for so long			0
we should expect some kind of deadly , although limited , attack to come soon			0
how should @entity114 and @entity22 respond ? for starters , they could clamp down on the @entity1 's multifaceted criminal activities and put psychological pressure on the elites			2
second , they could raise awareness on @entity1 's systematic and widespread human rights violations so that democratic countries come to view the regime as a threat to humanity instead of some abstract amalgamation of the dreadful and the bizarre			1
this approach may not yield immediate changes in regime behavior			0
but at the very least it will finally put the " stick " in the proverbial carrot - and - stick metaphor for taming @entity28			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			0

@entity164 : despite threats , @entity1 leadership is *n't* crazy or suicidal
@entity164 : @entity1 's goal is to get the @entity15 to withdraw troops from @entity8
he says the regime 's strategy is to instill fear in @entity8 and @entity15
@entity164 : the risk of @entity1 starting an all - out war is quite small
