@entity0 -- @entity2 is a 35 - year - old with a doctorate in electrical and computer engineering			1
but it 's her passion outside of work that has put her at the center of a debate -- one that could affect athletic competitions worldwide , even the @entity14			1
later this month , the @entity15 will take up the question of whether @entity17 may take part in officially sanctioned tournaments while keeping her entire body covered , aside from her hands and face , in keeping with her @entity25 faith			1
" it 's what i believe in			2
it 's what i 've chosen to do , " @entity17 tells @entity1 of her decision to wear modest garb			2
" i 've always dressed this way publicly			2
" @entity17 is not an @entity14 athlete , but enjoys lifting weights			2
she can deadlift 245 pounds ( 111 kg ) and get up 105 pounds ( 47.5 kg ) in the snatch , in which the competitor lifts the barbell from the floor to over her head in a single motion			0
she likes to compete with other women in her weight class -- she generally weighs in the 106 - pound ( 48 kg ) or 117 - pound ( 53 kg ) classifications			0
" it guess it 's empowering , " she says			0
" there 's a lot of technique involved , so someone who 's this big muscular person -- it 's possible i could lift more than they do			0
there 's speed and timing to it -- you have to be explosive			0
i think it 's great just for confidence building ... i guess i got hooked			0
" the @entity0 resident wants to take part in tournaments in the @entity63 , including one coming up in july			0
but @entity64 informed her that those events are governed by @entity15 rules			1
and those rules preclude her dressing in keeping with her beliefs			2
@entity17 generally wears loose , long pants past the ankles , a long - sleeve , fitted shirt with a loose t - shirt over it , and a hijab , or head scarf , covering her hair			0
the outfits -- officially called " costumes " -- worn at competitions must be collarless and must not cover the elbows or knees , according to the @entity15 's technical and competition rules			1
the @entity15 constitution also states that no distinction is made among individuals based on religion			1
@entity92 , a spokesman for the @entity93 -- which oversees @entity64 and many other sports -- explained part of the challenge is that judges need to see that a competitor 's elbows and knees are locked during a lift			1
but the @entity93 also understands the dilemma @entity17 faces			1
after @entity103 , the @entity103 -- a @entity105 - based group that advocates for @entity106 and @entity25 causes -- contacted the @entity93 on wednesday , @entity92 said , his group reached out to the @entity15			1
" i think their ( @entity103 's ) language is to ' advocate ' on the athlete 's behalf with the international federation , and we have done that , " @entity92 told @entity1			0
" the @entity14 movement is all about the universal values of equality			0
we value that greatly , but we also respect the rules of sport -- especially those set forth for competitive reasons			2
so we 're looking to see if there 's some way to accommodate -- not just this one particular athlete , " he said , adding , " this is an issue that has some wider implications			0
" the @entity15 has agreed to include the issue on the agenda of its next meeting , later this month in @entity132 , @entity92 said			1
the group 's technical committee will hold a debate , and then present a recommendation to the @entity15 board , @entity92 said			1
" awesome ! " @entity17 responded , when @entity1 informed her thursday of these developments			0
" the news came after months of pushing for change , she said			2
in april , @entity64 responded to an e-mail from her , explaining that it had to reject her request due to @entity15 rules			1
in that e-mail , there was no suggestion that the group or the @entity93 might take up the issue with the iwf			1
@entity153 , ceo of @entity64 , issued a statement thursday reiterating that the organization abides by the @entity15 rules on uniforms , and that the " issue has been brought to the attention of the @entity15 and the @entity159 has agreed to place the matter on the agenda of the next meeting , which will take place on june 26 in @entity164 , @entity132 , for consideration			1
" the @entity15 did not immediately respond to requests for comment thursday			1
@entity17 says she understands the need to make sure she is n't wearing anything under her clothes to give her a competitive advantage			0
she says judges could check to make sure she is not wearing something on her elbows , for example , that might help her			2
and she says she 's willing to wear a " snug " shirt -- though not skin tight -- underneath a loose singlet , so judges could " see that there 's lockout " in her arms when she does her lifts			0
@entity189 of @entity103 , which sent out a news release about @entity17 on wednesday , praised the @entity93 thursday for taking action			1
" it sounds like they 've really done exactly what we asked them to do , which is advocate on behalf of this @entity25 athlete , " @entity189 said			0
" the ultimate result is a very reasonable compromise that allows the @entity25 athlete to follow her religious beliefs and practices and maintain the legitimate rules and policies of @entity14 and sports in general			2
" while @entity17 was happy to hear the @entity15 will consider her situation , there is no guarantee the @entity15 will alter its rules			1
although there were no immediate , organized protests against the @entity93 's decision to bring @entity17 's case to the @entity15 , @entity93 spokesman @entity92 said his agency has received messages from people opposing any change in the rules			1
he did not characterize what the messages said or how many there were			2
numerous athletic agencies have faced similar questions in the past and , in some cases , have determined that allowing special clothing violates fairness or equality among all contestants			0
@entity234 , the international federation governing soccer , recently refused to allow @entity236 's women 's soccer team to wear headscarves while playing in an @entity14 qualifying round in @entity239 , @entity240			0
@entity17 told @entity1 her effort is not just about herself			0
" i should at least try , " she said , " if not for me then maybe for other women who -- if they have my faith or another faith -- dress a certain way			0

@entity2 wants to keep her body covered during official competitions
the @entity15 will consider her complaint
rules specify outfits must be collarless and must not cover the elbows or knees
the @entity93 has received some messages opposing a rule change
