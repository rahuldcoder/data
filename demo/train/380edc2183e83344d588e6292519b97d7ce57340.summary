-- a @entity2 court has ordered that the juvenile trial of @entity4 -- a boy accused of killing his father 's pregnant girlfriend three years ago -- be closed , despite a push by several newspapers to allow public access			1
@entity4 was 11 in february 2009 when , authorities say , he shot @entity12 , 26 , once at point - blank range in her western @entity2 farmhouse			1
she was eight months pregnant at the time			0
he was initially charged as an adult , facing the prospect of life in prison without parole			1
but on august 23 , 2011 , @entity22 judge @entity21 reversed his earlier ruling so that @entity4 would instead face a juvenile proceeding			1
a judge later ordered that these upcoming proceedings must be closed to the public			1
the @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31 newspapers subsequently filed an appeal , arguing that the public has a constitutional right to access the courts even when juveniles are involved			0
@entity2 's @entity37 issued a 33 - page ruling on wednesday , that was obtained friday by @entity40 from @entity0 's sister network @entity41 , regarding the appeal			1
the opinion , written by judge @entity44 , acknowledges that there " has been some recent tendency to permit publicity ( of ) juvenile court proceedings on the theory that this will act as a curb to juvenile delinquency			1
" but the court also expressed concerns that the harm caused by publicizing juvenile proceedings " may be great			0
" the order references an effort to maintain @entity4 's privacy , finding that " there is no alternative short of closure of the juvenile court proceedings " that will do so			1
" closure of the juvenile proceedings , under the constitutional analysis , serves a compelling government interest and ... there is no less restrictive means to serve that interest , " @entity44 wrote in the opinion			2
given the high - profile nature of the case , @entity0 is identifying @entity4 by name even though he is a juvenile			2
investigators say @entity12 was killed with a bullet fired from a youth model 20 - gauge shotgun that belonged to @entity4			0
the pregnant woman 's 4 - year - old daughter found her in her bed , according to police			0
the girl alerted landscapers working near the home , who then called authorities			0
@entity4 , who was living with his father at the time of the shooting , was subsequently charged with one count each of criminal homicide and homicide of an unborn child			2
the charges were initially filed in an adult court because , according to @entity2 state law , anyone older than 10 who has committed a murder or homicide is automatically tried as an adult			2
the defense then must present a sufficient case to move a case to juvenile court			0
at the time , @entity4 was thought to be the youngest person facing a life sentence without the possibility of parole , according to an @entity109 statement			0
@entity40 's @entity110 contributed to this report .			0

authorities say @entity4 , then 11 , shot and kiled his father 's pregnant girlfriend in 2009
initially charged as an adult , a @entity2 judge then ruled he *'d* be tried as a juvenile
3 @entity2 newspapers argued @entity4 's proceedings should be open to the public
a @entity37 opinion says they *'ll* be closed to *assure* the accused boy 's privacy
