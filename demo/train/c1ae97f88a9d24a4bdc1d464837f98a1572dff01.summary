-- life 's not always a beach			0
the @entity3 may win hearts for its white - sand beaches on perfect turquoise coves and high - end villas with moored yachts , but there 's another part of the story : its towns			1
some have histories that predate the @entity15 , cobbled centers that gaze out at the water and enough attractions to justify carving a day or two away from those perfect stretches of sand			0
@entity21 , @entity22 did you know @entity21 was nearly 100 when the @entity24 reached the @entity25 ? reached by frequent , direct ( sometimes cheap ) flights from the @entity28 , the historic @entity22 capital is a place that can fill a week 's stay easily			1
the cobblestoned lanes of @entity32 are filled with cafes , restaurants , hotels and sites including two seriously old forts ; most visitors see the six - floor , 16th - century @entity39 , but do n't overlook the @entity40 , which offers free spooky tunnel tours on weekends			1
@entity21 also has excellent art , free salsa lessons in clubs , fine dining in the ever - emerging @entity48 district on @entity49 , and excellent beaches below the city walls			1
for a break from the city pulse , day trip to hike the rainforest at nearby @entity56			0
@entity57 , @entity58 everyone knows about @entity57 , but that does n't mean it 's not fantastic			0
wandering about the crumbling grandeur of ' @entity63 ' feels like entering the world of a gritty 1950s movie			0
vintage @entity28 and @entity67 cars trundle past colonial tenements showing their age , and pick - up baseball games played with a stick			2
@entity72 is what one @entity0 author describes as ' hot hot hot salsa with young hot hot hot @entity58 '			2
locals drink tiny cups of homegrown coffee in a classic coffee house like @entity80 , fun spots to spend an hour or so			0
all this does n't come with lack of comfort			0
restored colonial hotels like the @entity86 ( tel 53 - 862 - 9293 ; @entity87 202 ) , where rooms with stained - glass windows over look a private courtyard			2
@entity0 : how to choose a @entity3 island @entity92 , @entity93 a lively @entity95 / @entity3 hybrid , the little capital of @entity93 is famed for its historic core -- a @entity98 of two neighborhoods split by a channel			1
boutique hotels made from 19th - century buildings ( best is @entity103 ) make @entity92 a good base to explore the town 's floating markets , atmospheric draw bridges names for @entity95 queens , an excellent museum unflinchingly detailing the slave trade , and cafes that look plucked from an @entity113 backstreet			1
grab a rental car and find hidden beach coves -- practically isolated -- to the north , along with a peek at @entity120 's plantations			0
@entity121 , @entity122 @entity122 's not for everyone , but as the nation struggles to rebuild after the 2010 earthquake , tourism is starting to pick up and giving a bit of an economic boost to boot			1
eighty miles south of the capital @entity131 , @entity121 is a charming town that was n't as damaged as the capital			0
it has many victorian - era buildings from the city 's coffee days , superb handicrafts including hand - painted boxes and animal toys , good beaches and a fun day trip to a grotto of cascades and cobalt - blue pools you can reach by horse for $ 20 or $ 25			2
set in a @entity149 mansion , the damaged and rebuilt @entity147 evokes a century - old vibe , with its period furniture and balconies in the rooms			1
from @entity131 you can bus three hours on good roads to @entity121			0
@entity155 , @entity156 , @entity157 & @entity158 the capital of this multi-island nation , wee @entity159 is home to only 5500 people on an island just six miles long			2
cruises dock for a few hours , but the fun rustic place warrants more time			0
in town , you 'll find colorful colonial buildings on narrow streets that still see donkey carts and historic sites , including the spot -- locals claim -- where @entity175 made his first foot - fall of the @entity177 in 1492			2
beaches to the north , like @entity180 or @entity181 , are frequently empty , while the best snorkeling and diving lies to the south ( @entity185 offers dives or snorkel gear )			0
the best place to stay is the @entity190 - themed @entity189 , who offers free use of their car to guests			1
but on @entity156 , a bike is really all you need			0
@entity0 : cracking the @entity3 on a budget @entity198 , @entity199 the @entity3 's largest city , @entity198 is a @entity177 firsts-fest			1
you 'll find the hemisphere 's first hospital and monastery ( lovelier than that might sound ) , and the oldest surviving fort and cathedral ( built by @entity175 ' son , no less )			0
its historic center easily fills a couple days of sightseeing before hitting @entity214 's famed beaches			0
best is just sitting over a long meal in the strip of outdoor restaurants set up in the 16th century buildings along @entity219 , or getting a drink in the cobbled alley @entity223 's bar / café scene			1
if you go in winter , february 's @entity224 is legendary , but just as memorable is catching a baseball game during @entity214 's 48 - game winter season from november to february ; you 'll see major leaguers from the @entity28 playing , and seats at the @entity230 start at us $ 6			2
@entity231 , @entity232 the @entity3 's most unique island -- the last to be colonized , the most mountainous of the @entity235 islands -- @entity232 is sometimes seen as the ' anti-caribbean ' , considering its lack of sandy beaches or flashy resorts			1
unsurprisingly perhaps , visitors often consider it the friendliest			0
and because it 's so small -- just 29 miles by 16 miles -- you can set up in its lively capital of 1500 residents living in cute stone - and - wood historic homes , @entity231 ( @entity252 - oh ) and day trip to waterfalls and open - air hot spring pools in the rainforest , or beaches with snorkeling spots that bubble like champagne from offshore volcanic vents ( it 's safe )			1
the best day trip involves a tough six - hour hike up to reach the @entity259 ; it 's best done with a guide ( @entity261 went with @entity263 's @entity262 )			0
there are no direct flights outside the region ; the best gateways to @entity232 are via @entity268 , @entity269 or @entity270 on @entity271 or @entity272			1
@entity273 , @entity274 tiny , off - the - radar and rather unusual , the tiny island of @entity274 ( or ' @entity274 ' ; population 3400 ) has been home to @entity279 , @entity280 , @entity95 and @entity282 residents ; in 1776 , it became the first foreign ' power ' to recognize the @entity28			1
now known for its diving , @entity274 has but one town , @entity273 , memorable mostly for what it 's lost			0
in town you can explore remnants of an 18th - century synagogue or collapsed @entity95 church , then grab a snorkel to swim to offshore ruins of a part of town built on land - fill and since reclaimed by the sea			1
afterwards , plan a day trip hike up the nearby @entity301 , a once - active volcano with great views from its crater			1

set in a @entity149 mansion , the rebuilt @entity147 in @entity122 evokes a century - old vibe
