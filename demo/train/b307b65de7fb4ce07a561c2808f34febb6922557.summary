can this prince topple the king of world football 's governing body ? prince @entity5 has stepped forward to challenge @entity6 for the @entity8 presidency at may 's election			1
@entity6 , 78 , is seeking a fifth consecutive term in office despite growing disillusion with the way the organization has been run during his tenure			1
the @entity17 , who became president in 1998 , has not faced a credible challenger since taking office but will now find himself in the middle of a real battle			1
" i am seeking the presidency of @entity8 because i believe it is time to shift the focus away from administrative controversy and back to sport , " prince @entity5 said in a statement			1
" this was not an easy decision			0
it came after careful consideration and many discussions with respected @entity8 colleagues over the last few months			2
" the message i heard , over and over , was that it is time for a change			0
the world 's game deserves a world - class governing body â€” an @entity41 that is a service organization and a model of ethics , transparency and good governance			0
" @entity8 has been been heavily criticized following allegations of corruption over its bidding process for the 2018 and 2022 @entity49			2
@entity50 was awarded the 2018 @entity52 and @entity53 the event for 2022			0
a @entity8 investigation found no wrongdoing in the process			2
prince @entity5 , 39 , is the third son of @entity58 's late @entity57 from his marriage to his third wife , @entity60			1
he was elected @entity8 vice president representing @entity62 in 2011			2
he also serves as the president of @entity58 's soccer governing body and is founder and president of the @entity67			2
prince @entity5 has played a key role in the promotion of women 's sport , securing @entity58 's position as hosts of the women 's under - 17 @entity52 which is scheduled to take place next year			1
he also successfully campaigned to lift the ban on female @entity77 players wearing headscarves during competition			0
the @entity80 , a non-profit organization , was created by prince @entity5 in 2012 to encourage youth participation in football throughout the continent			1
it runs projects across @entity62 on empowering women within football , youth development and raising knowledge of the game			0
prince @entity5 is believed to already have secured the backing of @entity92 , the president of @entity93 , @entity93 's governing body			1
@entity92 is expected to examine the policies and manifesto of the @entity58 royal before recommending to the 54 members of @entity93 that they back the candidate at the election on may 29 in @entity100			0
in a statement made on tuesday , the @entity101 said : " i know prince @entity5 well			1
he has all the credibility required to hold high office			0
we now await his proposals and his program for the future of football			0
" but prince @entity5 faces a more difficult challenge to secure support from his own region with a number of countries in the @entity62 likely to support his opponent			1
speaking to reporters last november , @entity116 , head of the @entity62 , reiterated his confederation 's support for @entity6			2
" we made it clear during the @entity123 congress ( in june ) and even in the official nomination when president @entity6 nominated himself and we all said that @entity62 is supporting of @entity6 in the next election , " he told reporters last year			1
" this is the decision by the congress and a decision by the exco			0
what i heard in the media is so far unofficial and i ca n't comment on that			0
all i can comment on about is the official stand where the @entity62 and the exco have made it clear			0
" i 'm just focusing on what we have decided upon and agreed upon and i think that @entity58 and prince @entity5 were a part of that @entity139			1
" i think we made up our mind and we decided and that 's it			0
we are , lets say , a nation that we do n't change our minds			0
once we commit and we give our word then we are committed			0
" one additional problem facing prince @entity5 is that his own place on the executive committee could come under threat			1
according to a rule change implemented last june by the @entity62 , the head of the confederation , in this case @entity154 , will take the seat on the executive committee and the vice presidency too			0
to ensure he remains on the executive committee , prince @entity5 will have to win one of @entity62 's seats if he is to keep his place			1
prince @entity5 will attend the @entity162 in @entity163 which begins this week and is expected to be quizzed on his proposals and policies			1
but he remains adamant that any campaign should be about football and not the organization he is hoping to lead			0
" the headlines should be about football , not about @entity8 , " he said			2
" @entity8 exists to serve a sport which unites billions of people from all over the world , people of differing and divergent political , religious and social affiliations , who come together in their enjoyment of ' the world 's game			2
' " prince @entity5 joins @entity101 @entity181 in announcing his intention to stand against @entity6			1
the cut off point for those wanting to contest the election is january 29 .			2

" the headlines should be about football , not about @entity8 , " says @entity5
@entity8 president @entity6 wants to run for a fifth term
prince @entity5 only real credible challenger to @entity6
