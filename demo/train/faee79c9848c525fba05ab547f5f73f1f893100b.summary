between light - hearted moments like @entity3 taking a swig from a hip flask and @entity6 parading on stage in his underwear , it was all about activism and controversial topics at the 87th @entity11			1
a broad range of issues , from immigration to suicide to alzheimer 's disease to wage inequality , took center stage			1
@entity19 rubbed many the wrong way when he joked " who gave this son of a bitch his green card ? " as he presented @entity26 director @entity25 the best picture award for " birdman			1
" @entity25 seemed unperturbed and devoted the @entity11 win to his fellow @entity26 , saying , " i just pray they can be treated with the same dignity and respect of the ones that came before and built this incredible , immigrant nation			1
" in the press room , @entity25 said of @entity19 's joke , " i found it hilarious			1
@entity19 and i have that kind of brutal ( relationship ) where only true friendship can survive			2
" mostly , though , the night belonged to messages of empowerment			0
after expressing the usual gratitude to cast and crew of @entity46 's " boyhood , " best supporting actress winner @entity42 took a moment at the end of her acceptance speech to call for equal pay for women			1
" to every woman who gave birth to every taxpayer and citizen in this nation : we have fought for everybody else 's equal rights			2
it 's our time to have wage equality in the @entity66 , " she said , causing an uproar in the room as well as on social media			2
despite @entity69 's whooping approval , some viewers said the irony was not lost on them that @entity42 's speech was given at such a lavish affair			1
others argued that although the message was important , it marginalized the @entity77 and non-white communities			0
@entity78 , who was nominated for best actress for her role in " @entity81 , " advocated for the hashtag # @entity82 , which encourages red carpet presenters to ask more thought - provoking questions instead of the usual appearance - driven ones like " who are you wearing ? " @entity89 gave an emotional speech after his win for best adapted screenplay for " @entity93			1
" " when i was 16 years old , i tried to kill myself because i felt weird and i felt different and i felt like i did not belong , " @entity89 said			1
" and now i 'm standing here , and so i would like this moment to be for that kid out there who feels like she 's weird or she 's different or she does n't fit in anywhere			2
stay different , and then when it 's your turn and you are standing on this stage , please pass this same message to the next person who comes along			2
" the hashtag # @entity105 took off in the wake of @entity89 's speech			1
resources for suicide awareness and prevention include the @entity112 and the @entity113			0
and lastly , @entity114 got preachy about a topic that hits close to home for many : the winner of best supporting actor for " whiplash " encouraged viewers to # @entity122			0
" and if i may , call your mom			0
everybody -- i 'm told there 's like a billion people or so			0
call your mom ; call your dad			0
if you are lucky enough to have a parent or two alive on this planet , call them			0
do n't text , do n't email , " he said			0
so , have you called her yet ?			0
