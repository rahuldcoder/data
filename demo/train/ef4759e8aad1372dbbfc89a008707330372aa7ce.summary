@entity0 , @entity1 -- the masked henchmen grabbed three fingers on each of the @entity8 political cartoonist 's hands and pulled them back all the way -- so far that they cracked			1
" break his arms so that he does n't ever draw again , " one said			0
@entity12 -- the cartoonist who described the 2011 attack to me in a recent interview -- soon found himself bleeding and left for dead near the @entity17 airport			1
his assailants , who he believes were acting on behalf of the @entity8 regime , dragged him alongside a moving car			1
his head and shoulder bounced on the pavement and then the men shoved him out of the vehicle , dumping him on the side of the road			0
@entity12 wondered if he would live , let alone draw again			1
it would be months before he would learn the second answer			0
before i 'd heard these and the other horrifying details of this attack against one of the @entity36 world 's most notable artists , i asked @entity12 -- an @entity36 - @entity38 - looking character with a smile that could cheer up @entity40 -- if he was sure his hands were broken to stop him from drawing cartoons critical of @entity8 's leader , @entity43			1
his answer made me laugh			0
" obviously , " he said			0
" what do i look like to you , a chef ? " i met @entity12 in at the @entity48 , a gathering of dissidents and human rights activists , where he received the @entity52			1
being in his presence was the human - rights nerd version of a basketball fan meeting @entity56			1
but what impressed me most about @entity12 is that he 's maintained his wit and cheer despite the darkness that has fallen on him and on his country , which is in the grips of an intractable two - year war that 's killed an estimated 80,000 people			1
he is almost naively optimistic about @entity8 's future			1
the rest of @entity8 's opposition should take note			1
as his story shows , the true strength of a revolution is in its ideas -- in nonviolent actions such as drawing truth to power			1
dictators do have reason to be scared of cartoons			0
that 's why @entity12 's hands became some of the most feared objects in @entity8			1
" they came after me , " he said			0
" obviously ( cartooning ) has power			0
" the self - taught artist , who 's in his early 60s , has been using them to mock authority since he was a young boy -- first imitating cartoons he admired and then creating satire of his own			1
he went pro in the 1970s , gaining notoriety for publishing cartoons domestically and internationally			0
back then , before the current war , @entity12 never dared to depict specific people in his cartoons			1
he drew autocrats and dictators , but they never looked like real , identifiable people			0
he did it to avoid censorship or retaliation			0
but that was before the war -- before reports emerged , in may 2011 , that a 13 - year - old had been tortured and killed in @entity107 , @entity8			1
stories like those of @entity111 's death , which reportedly involved his genitals being mutilated , pushed @entity12 across a threshold			1
he started to draw exact likeness of @entity43 in his satire			0
his pen would hold no punches			0
@entity12 drew @entity43 standing on the side of the road with his thumb in the air , ready to hitchhike out of @entity8			1
a crazed @entity122 , who was still alive at the time but later would be killed in @entity125 's uprising , was driving a getaway car			2
the message was clear : @entity8 's leader had to go			1
that was the image , he told me , that led to his attack on august 25 , 2011			1
@entity12 's animated demeanor -- his eyebrows bounce when he talks and his hands , now unbandaged , gesture wildly -- flattened as he told me the story			1
that day , a white car with darkly tinted windows followed him out of the studio before dawn			0
he 's been working there by candlelight to avoid detection			2
frightened by the car , he drove to the center of @entity17 , to a square he knew to be home to government buildings and the president 's palace			2
the car followed and crashed into him at the square , he said , forcing him stop			0
three men emerged and yanked off the doors of @entity12 's car			1
they pulled him from it , beat him with crowd - control batons and then yanked plastic handcuffs around his wrists			2
" they handcuffed me so tightly i felt that one of my wrists was going to break , " he said			0
@entity164 , the @entity8 state news agency , reported @entity12 " was attacked by veiled people " and that " authorities concerned are conducting an investigation			1
" my e-mail requesting further information , however , was not responded to			0
and the @entity171 condemned the attack , saying in a statement that the @entity43 regime was sending " a clear message that ( @entity176 ) should stop drawing			2
" they beat him so badly that his vision failed for days in one eye , @entity178 told me , and he could barely see out of the other			0
confused , @entity12 asked what was happening to him			1
" do n't you ever dare to cross your bosses and to cross your leaders , because @entity43 's shoe is on your face and on your head			2
" ( for evidence of the severity of that insult , recall the @entity195 and @entity196 shoe - throwing incidents )			2
they drove 30 minutes to a road near the @entity17 airport			0
that 's where they threw him from the car			2
" my white shirt was completely , totally , red from the blood , " he said			0
he thought he surely would bleed to death there			0
cars would n't stop , perhaps afraid to pick up a person targeted by the regime or by police			0
but then the first of three miracles happened : a truck 's tire burst , forcing it to stop exactly in front of @entity219			2
" this is like something out of a freakin ' movie , " @entity220 , a blogger - author friend who was translating the conversation from @entity222 , said to me			2
@entity12 threw himself into the bed of the pickup and begged the three men who drove it to take him back to the city			1
they agreed to drop him at the gates of @entity17 , but would n't take him further -- definitely not to a hospital -- for fear of being targeted themselves			0
still bleeding and barely able to see because of the beatings to his head , @entity12 wandered up to a house and asked its guard for help			1
then the second miracle : the guard agreed to give him a ride to a nearby clinic , where ( here 's the third ) doctors recognized the cartoonist and were sympathetic to his cause			1
they treated him at his house to avoid detection			0
but there was always the worry : his hands			2
would he draw again ? " my hands became stuck like this , " he told me , tensing up his digits into a wooden , claw - like shape			1
" the doctors told me i needed to get treatment overseas			0
" fate , again , would intervene			0
using a newspaper contact in @entity265 , @entity12 arranged to leave @entity8 and seek treatment in a hospital there			1
after six months of surgery and physical therapy , he was able to put pen to paper			0
the first cartoon he created after the attack was not diluted by fear			2
he drew @entity43 and @entity278 's @entity277 walking side by side , their legs intertwined to make the shape of a @entity282 swastika			0
@entity12 is still living in exile			1
but the revolution needs him			0
it needs his art. he 's seen images of protesters and rebels carrying printouts of his drawings			0
so he contributes art from outside the country			0
the outcome of the war in @entity8 is anything but sure			2
but talk to @entity12 and his optimism will rub off on you			2
he 's convinced he will live and draw in @entity8 again -- that people in his country , a cradle of civilization that invented one of the world 's first alphabets , are no longer afraid and eventually will triumph over the regime that would crush their spirits and their art. after hearing his story , i 'm hard - pressed not to believe him			1
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity314 .			2
