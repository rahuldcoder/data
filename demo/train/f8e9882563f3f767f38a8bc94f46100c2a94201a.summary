@entity0 -- defense secretary @entity4 is expected to approve sending thousands of additional forces to @entity6 to deal with the growing threat from roadside bombs , @entity3 spokesman @entity2 said friday			1
@entity9 detonate a roadside bomb			2
injuries from the bombs have increased 700 percent in two years			1
over the past two weeks , @entity4 has concluded that there are not enough forces or equipment in @entity6 to protect @entity17 troops from the threat of roadside bombs , @entity2 said			1
the secretary , he said , wants to send these forces " as soon as possible			1
" @entity2 said the deployment would be separate from any that might be requested by gen. @entity24			0
the plan could send nearly 3,000 troops , another @entity17 military official familiar with the proposal said			1
he said @entity3 planners have already identified some of the units that would be sent			0
this official asked not to be identified because no final decision has been announced			0
plans have been in place to set the @entity17 troop level in @entity6 at 68,000 since earlier this year , when president @entity37 approved an additional 21,000 troops			1
the decision comes at a sensitive time politically			0
in the last few days , two key @entity40 have questioned sending additional troops			2
" i do n't think there 's a great deal of support for sending more troops to @entity6 in the country or in @entity49 , " speaker of the house @entity50 , @entity52 , told reporters thursday			2
on friday , sen. @entity53 , the head of the @entity54 who has recently returned from @entity6 , said the emphasis should be on training and increasing the size of the @entity6 army before considering more @entity17 forces			1
" our primary goal should be to strengthen the @entity6 army and the police , to provide the necessary training and equipment and also to see if we ca n't reintegrate some of the lower - level @entity69 people , who are the young people who are n't the religious zealots but are being taken advantage of by the leaders , " @entity53 , @entity61 , told @entity62			2
@entity4 himself has been a vocal opponent of expanding the @entity17 presence for fear that the forces would be seen as occupiers by the @entity6 population			1
but last week , he softened that position , saying @entity24 had made a persuasive argument that the concern should not be on the size of the forces but on their conduct			0
@entity2 said the proposal may not raise total @entity17 troop strength above 68,000 , because some of the units already scheduled to go could be sent not fully staffed or others already there could be sent home			2
still , " the secretary has already determined this is a requirement that needs to be fulfilled , " @entity2 said			0
" the forces there now require more ied protection			0
" the troops would specialize in route clearance , explosive ordnance disposal , medical treatment and intelligence - gathering , @entity2 said			0
" we owe this to the troops already committed to the fight , " he said			0
since 2007 , the number of roadside bombs in @entity6 has jumped 350 percent , according to the @entity3			1
though many are found before they detonate , the number of troops killed has increased by more than 400 percent and the number wounded is up more 700 percent over the last two years			1
one @entity17 military source told @entity1 that the @entity69 's capacity to manufacture bombs , train attackers and target @entity17 troops has grown over the past year			1
on september 8 near @entity119 , troops seized five tons of ammonium nitrate , more than twice the amount used in the bombing of the federal building in @entity124 , @entity125 , in 1995			0
on august 27 , @entity127 plastic explosives were found in @entity128 by @entity6 troops			2
@entity6 's rugged terrain and dirt roads make it easy to quickly hide roadside bombs			1
" you have disturbed earth all the time , " said gen. @entity134 , former head of the @entity3 's @entity135			0
" especially close to villages and close to intersections -- that just makes the seeing and finding , even by soldiers ' eyes , a lot more complicated			0
" the @entity69 have proven adept at adjusting their strategy as circumstances change			0
seeing that troops were routinely stopping ahead of culverts to search for bombs that could be hidden under the roads , insurgents have started placing the bombs ahead of the culverts .			2
