-- @entity2 holders @entity1 crashed to a 3 - 1 defeat at @entity5 club @entity4 on tuesday night as the @entity7 side were again tormented by young winger @entity8			1
the 21 - year - old , who scored a hat - trick in the @entity13 team 's 4 - 3 defeat at the @entity14 two weeks ago , again embarrassed the much - vaunted @entity1 defense to set up second - half goals for strikers @entity17 and @entity19 after @entity21 's opener			1
the result put tournament debutants @entity4 top of @entity24 on goal difference , having joined @entity1 on seven points from four matches			1
@entity29 champions @entity28 boosted their hopes of reaching the second round with a 2 - 0 win at @entity34 club @entity33 , moving onto five points			1
your chance to ask @entity38 your questions ... @entity4 started the game boosted by the presence of key midfielder @entity21 , who injured his hamstring in saturday 's 2 - 0 defeat at @entity44			1
the @entity29 again had to go off at halftime , but made a vital contribution in the 18th minute as he timed his run to perfection to collect @entity49 's clever pass and beat stand - in @entity1 goalkeeper @entity50 with a clinical left - foot shot			2
it should have been 2 - 0 soon after but @entity17 opted to try an ambitious volley from @entity8 's teasing cross when @entity21 was unmarked inside him			1
@entity55 started in goal for @entity4 in place of the suspended @entity58 , sent off early at the @entity14 , and the @entity1 - born keeper kept the score level at halftime with a superb save from @entity62 's right - foot free - kick			1
@entity1 boss @entity38 gave 19 - year - old midfielder @entity63 his first - team debut in the 52nd minute , but @entity4 went 2 - 0 up just after the hour when @entity8 raced down the left past @entity67 fullback @entity66 and curled a perfect low cross into the path of @entity17			1
@entity38 responded by bringing on teen prodigy @entity70 and may 's final hero @entity71 , but it was the @entity76 forward 's early - season replacement @entity73 who continued his hot scoring run to reduce the deficit			0
the @entity80 striker cut inside fullback @entity81 and curled a right - foot effort past @entity55 -- who started his career at @entity1 's city rivals @entity85 -- to set up a tense finish with 10 minutes to go			2
but @entity4 sealed victory in the 89th minute when @entity8 took the ball inside his own half , pushed it past @entity90 and sped past the veteran @entity93 @entity92 winner with nonchalant ease to set up @entity17 's replacement @entity19 in a near repeat of the second goal			1
@entity71 skimmed the top of the bar in injury - time , but @entity1 fell to a first defeat in the tournament since the second leg of last season 's semifinal against @entity105			1
no disrespects to the right - back @entity66 , but he has given him a torrid time			0
it was amazing to see , " @entity4 manager @entity108 told reporters			0
" the whole team was brilliant			0
we were the better team from start to finish			0
it was an outstanding performance -- it was a pleasure to be part of it			0
" @entity28 took advantage of @entity33 captain @entity120 ' second - half sending - of to score two late goals and pick up a first victory of the campaign			0
the midfielder was red - carded for hauling back @entity126 with 16 minutes to play , and the @entity29 side capitalized five minutes later as @entity129 forward @entity128 fired in a shot that deflected off per @entity131			0
@entity128 then set @entity126 free in the 84th minute and the @entity134 international 's cross was headed home by @entity136 to boost @entity28 ahead of the trip to @entity1 on november 24			2
@entity105 stayed top of @entity139 despite being held 1 - 1 away to @entity140 , with both goals coming in the space of a minute			1
star forward @entity143 put the @entity145 champions ahead just after half an hour in @entity146 with a rare right - footed effort as he pounced on the loose ball to poke the ball in off the post			0
but @entity140 hit back immediately as @entity105 goalkeeper @entity151 , in for the suspended @entity152 , could not deal with @entity154 's cross and @entity93 midfielder @entity155 volleyed in the equalizer			2
@entity157 hit the post with a scorching late effort for @entity105 , who stayed a point ahead of @entity140			2
@entity163 champions @entity162 lost ground on the top two teams after being held to a second successive 0 - 0 draw by bottom club @entity167 , this time despite having home advantage			1
@entity44 cruised to a 3 - 0 win away to @entity170 despite fielding several fringe players against the @entity173 champions			1
the 2008 winners are now in pole position to qualify from @entity176 , needing just a point from the upcoming trip to @entity179 to ensure a place in the second round			0
@entity185 midfielder @entity184 opened the scoring three minutes after halftime with a measured right - foot effort , then 21 - year - old @entity183 forward @entity182 smashed in his first goal for @entity44 as the defense retreated in the 73rd minute			2
four minutes later , veteran midfielder @entity191 set up @entity2 debutant @entity192 for the 20 - year - old 's second goal for the @entity5 club			0
@entity196 moved above @entity179 into second place , three points behind @entity44 , with a 3 - 0 home victory over the @entity201 champions			1
@entity203 striker @entity202 scored in either half , forcing home from a corner in the 31st minute and firing a low shot underneath goalkeeper @entity208 with 19 minutes left			0
@entity209 sealed victory right at the end with a fine lunging left - foot volley that went in off the post , as @entity179 were left to rue two efforts from striker @entity215 that came back off the woodwork			0
@entity217 remain top of @entity219 despite suffering a 4 - 3 defeat away to @entity221 , with the @entity223 club taking a four - goal lead after 67 minutes			1
@entity225 scored twice while @entity226 and @entity227 also netted before the @entity183 side rallied with goals in the final 15 minutes from @entity230 , @entity231 and @entity232			0
the result left previously unbeaten @entity217 with nine points , while @entity221 picked up their second win to close to within a point of second - placed @entity237			0
the @entity34 club can still reach the second round despite drawing 0 - 0 away to bottom side @entity240 , who now can not qualify			2
however , the result did little to help the position of @entity237 coach @entity245 , who is under increasing pressure after a poor start to the @entity249 season .			0
