@entity0 , @entity1 -- oil left on the surface of the @entity6 is breaking down naturally now that the flow of crude has been cut off beneath the surface , a @entity3 admiral said sunday after touring the scene			1
rear adm. @entity11 said the remnants of @entity13 did little to affect the oil slick , which is breaking down " very quickly			1
" " the storm itself was not that significant , " @entity11 told @entity2 after an aerial survey of the northern @entity6 on sunday			2
" we 've had nine days of no new oil being released , so what we 're seeing is the remnants of oil that was released nine days ago			2
" @entity24 crews managed to temporarily cap the undersea well at the heart of the three - month - old disaster on june 15			0
but efforts to close off the gusher permanently by drilling a relief well were delayed by the storm , which forced the ships involved in the process to evacuate the area			1
those ships have returned to the area since the storm , he told reporters sunday night			1
@entity11 told reporters that he saw only one large patch of emulsified oil , about 12 miles off @entity42 , @entity1 , during his six - hour aerial tour			0
no oil could be seen in @entity1 's @entity45 , @entity46 or @entity47 , while only a light sheen was visible in other parts of the @entity6			0
" the oil is basically approaching the end of its life cycle , " he said			0
oil had gushed from the ruptured well for nearly three months after the @entity56 rig exploded april 20 , leaving 11 workers dead			0
officials have said a relief well is the only permanent solution to the disaster , which saw as much as 60,000 barrels ( 2.5 million gallons ) of crude spewing into the @entity6 every day			0
ships critical for drilling the well started evacuating thursday and returning saturday afternoon , once @entity63 lost her punch after crossing southern @entity66			1
the weather forced officials to temporarily scale back efforts to search beneath the surface for leaking oil and permanently plug the leak , drawing some criticism from local officials that the federal government was overreacting to the storm			1
but retired @entity3 adm. @entity3 , who is leading the federal government 's response to the spill , emphasized the need to move and protect equipment before a storm			2
he said told reporters friday that he was still " haunted " by the sight of submerged school buses " that could not be used for the evacuation " after @entity86 struck @entity0 in 2005			0
" we 're going to be playing a cat - and - mouse game for the remainder of the hurricane season , " @entity3 said			2
sunday , @entity3 said officials were examining new oil deposits on the shoreline created by the storm , and booms that were in sensitive marsh areas caused damage during the storm and may need to be removed before another surge happens			1
but with the storm 's passing , work on the relief well is scheduled to continue , he said			0
and by august 1 , he said crews could begin pumping drilling " mud " into the ruptured well to force oil back into the reservoir below -- a process known as a " static kill			1
" @entity2 's @entity110 , @entity111 and @entity112 contributed to this report .			0
