-- president @entity1 and @entity3 president @entity2 just announced a major agreement to cut carbon emissions in both countries and tackle global warming over the coming decades			1
as the news site @entity10 puts it , " this is a big deal			1
" it 's a big deal for citizens of both countries who will literally breathe easier due to reduced pollution			1
it 's a big deal for the future of our planet			1
and it 's even a big deal for republicans , who had used inaction on the part of @entity3 to justify not doing anything about climate change here at home			1
and yet @entity29 leaders , many of whom remain inexplicably skeptical of the conclusive science about climate change , insist they will use their new congressional majority to try to obstruct clean air and water regulations enacted by the @entity36			1
for added measure , they will try to force president @entity1 to approve the construction of the @entity40 pipeline extension			2
they will , apparently , be joined by centrist democrats like sen. @entity43 , facing a tough run - off election for her seat in @entity47 in december			0
in other words , just as @entity3 is finally taking a significant step forward in reducing climate change emissions , the @entity48 risks taking two steps back			1
@entity3 's economic growth already exceeds ours , and the @entity55 has projected that in 2016 @entity3 will overtake @entity48 as the world 's biggest economy			1
@entity3 has already passed the @entity48 in the share of the world 's college enrollment , producing more than twice as many college graduates each year			1
will @entity3 also beat the @entity48 in the race to address climate change and profit from doing so ? the @entity40 pipeline is a great test case			1
the disastrous environmental impact of the pipeline is obvious			0
simply mining the tar sands — let alone consuming the actual oil down the road — will release an incredible amount of carbon into the atmosphere			0
then the thick tar sands crude would go into the 1,179 mile long @entity40 , winding past family farms and playgrounds and lakes and water reservoirs as it makes its way from @entity81 to @entity82			2
the current @entity40 pipeline , which runs from @entity81 to the @entity84 , leaked a record 12 times just in its first year of operation			2
even if you 're a conservative who does n't believe the vast majority of the world 's scientists agree that climate change is both real and man - made , hopefully you still believe in facts			1
and the facts suggest that the @entity40 pipeline is a bad deal not just for @entity48 's environment but also for our economy			1
in 2008 , in its original application to the @entity102 seeking pipeline approval , the company @entity100 said the @entity40 would involve " a peak workforce of approximately 3,500 to 4,200 construction personnel			2
" but by 2011 , when the pipeline project had become controversial , @entity100 told a @entity108 subcommittee the project would create 20,000 jobs			0
@entity100 and the @entity111 have also alleged that an additional 119,000 jobs would be directly or indirectly created by the pipeline			0
yet an independent academic study found the project would indeed create " no more than 2,500 - 4,650 temporary direct construction jobs for two years " and that , in fact , spills and the cost of damage from the pipeline could kill more jobs than it creates in the long term			0
well , at least the pipeline would help working families in @entity48 by lowing gas prices , right ? wrong			0
according to analysis by both @entity0 and @entity129 , the pipeline would actually raise gas prices by creating a way for oil produced in the @entity84 to make it to coastal refineries for exporting			0
what the @entity40 clearly would do is divert investment away from renewable energy — and investments in renewable energy produce more bang for the buck			0
every $ 1 million invested in fossil fuels creates just 5.3 jobs while the same amount invested in clean energy creates 16.7 jobs			0
in other words , if @entity48 builds the @entity40 , not only are we not getting a lot of short - term jobs out of the deal and risking the economic cost of crude spills , but we 're failing to put investment into green energy opportunity that will yield far more jobs now and in the future			1
it 's plain to see which choice makes sense not only for our planet but for our economy and working families			0
earlier this year , the @entity164 on the @entity165 released a report detailing that over the next 15 years , worldwide efforts to limit carbon emissions would cost about $ 4 trillion , which is about 5 % more than would already be spent on infrastructure upgrades to power plants and public transit and other systems			2
but once you factor in things like lower fuel costs plus fewer deaths from pollution and lower medical bills , this greening actually saves money			0
but what it also does is create big potential to make money from the companies — and countries — leading the way			0
solar technology alone generates over $ 100 billion per year in revenues worldwide , a figure steadily climbing			0
currently , @entity3 makes 64 % of the world 's solar panels and their production is expected to double by 2017			0
the @entity48 is lagging behind in this and other rapidly expanding green markets			0
there was a time when @entity29 openly accepted the realities of climate change and championed public policy solutions			1
now the issue has become yet another partisan football			2
projects like the @entity40 pipeline are championed by conservatives not because they make any rational or economic sense but because they are convenient symbols for protesting climate science and president @entity1			2
meanwhile , as @entity29 bury their heads in the sand , @entity3 has an eye toward the future			2
if we do n't catch up and take real steps to join the green energy future now , @entity48 risks being left behind — drowning in a crude - like pool of our own economic irrelevance .			1

@entity222 : the @entity48 - @entity3 agreement to cut carbon emissions is a big deal
@entity222 : @entity29 need to wake up to the fact that global warming is real and man - made
she says the @entity40 would be bad for climate and @entity48 economy
@entity222 : @entity29 should n't treat climate change as partisan football and set @entity48 behind
