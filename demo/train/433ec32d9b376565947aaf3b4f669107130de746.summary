-- when @entity2 of @entity3 was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer and told he had at best five months to live , he did n't immediately begin the chemotherapy treatments his doctor recommended			2
instead , he and his wife , @entity7 , drove up the @entity9 coast and spent a week among the redwoods north of @entity11			2
expert : @entity13 and friends can help the terminally ill by spending time with them			1
" these trees are 5 feet wide and 150 feet tall , " said @entity2 , 43			2
" they still have another 150 feet to grow and are going to stick around for another 1,000 years			0
when i thought about that , i 'm just a flea on the bark			0
" the trip offered @entity2 , who worked in the auto repossession business , and his wife a chance to come to terms with the diagnosis in august 2008 , and to scratch the trip to the redwood forests off his life " to do " list while he was still relatively healthy			0
he died four months later			1
the idea that dying well is as important as living well gained cultural currency last year when @entity33 , a computer science professor at @entity34 , delivered a final lecture a month after learning that his pancreatic cancer had spread and was inoperable			1
the lecture was viewed millions of times on the @entity38 and adapted into a best - selling book			0
" we can not change the cards we are dealt , " @entity33 , who died in july at age 47 , told his audience , " just how we play the hand			1
" " die the way you live " it 's easy , experts say , for terminally ill patients and their loved ones to focus so much on their medical care and other important practical matters , including funerals and wills , that a " good " death eludes them			1
health permitting , a trip like the one @entity2 took with his wife can help , as can visits from friends and family			1
" you 're going to die the way you live , " says @entity62 , a former hospice volunteer and author of " @entity64			1
" " @entity67 , music , all of the things that have been important in your life -- if you put them to work for making your end times better , you can actually affect your dying days			1
" " that 's where @entity33 has set a wonderful example			1
he brought all of his skills to bear on living until the moment he died			1
" @entity81 , a retired foreign service officer from @entity82 , @entity83 , went on a @entity85 cruise with his wife , @entity86 , after he learned in september 2004 that he had amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or @entity88			0
as his illness progressed , @entity81 , a former adjunct professor of public policy at @entity90 , put his teaching and writing skills to work by starting a blog , " navigating through @entity88 , " and using it as a platform to help others suffering from the disease			1
" i 'm not a compiler of life lists of things i never got to do and places i never got to visit , " @entity81 wrote in december 2007			0
" i look back on my life to date and view it as a well - judged race -- like a @entity107 race in which you do n't set the speed record , but you do n't crash , handle the curves well , and deliver a respectable performance			1
" @entity81 died september 4 , 2008 at age 67			1
@entity114 , a part - time editor , says her husband 's illness , while painful and difficult , offered an opportunity of sorts			0
" if i had to choose between a long - term illness and an immediate death , i think i would go for a long - term illness , although it was hard on both of us , " she says			1
" but the last four years have been incredible years , probably the best years of our marriage			0
we became closer than we ever were			0
" for friends and family friends and family can help tremendously simply by showing up , says @entity129 , vice president of professional leadership , consumer and caregiver services for the @entity132			0
often , she says , people worry so much about what to say to someone with a terminal illness -- or about saying the wrong thing -- that they just stay away			1
" we need to put aside our selfish fears , " says @entity138			0
" that may sound a little harsh , but it 's not really about us			0
" one way to avoid saying the wrong thing is to steer clear of cliches , she says			1
" ' @entity145 has a reason ' or ' tomorrow will be another day ' -- those kinds of things are trite , but they 're also impersonal , " says @entity138			0
" if the person wants to chat and talk , then just ask a question or two and let the person talk			0
if the person 's not physically well enough to do a lot of talking , ask if they 'd like to hear a story about something that happened at work , or saying , ' would you like me to read a story to you ? ' it 's all about figuring out where the person is at and meeting them where they are			0
" visits can be used to tie up loose ends or resolve old conflicts , says @entity138			1
@entity114 says her husband had time to repair one particularly nagging rift before he died , and @entity2 also took opportunities to resolve disputes with friends and former co-workers			2
" most people at the end of their life need closure , " says @entity138			2
" if they 've offended someone or had an argument with somebody , they can say they 're sorry			0
oftentimes they like the opportunity to say goodbye to people			2
they may not say those words , but that 's what those visits can be with friends and loved ones			2
" in @entity62 ' view , the biggest hurdle for most people is overcoming their fear of the unknown and realizing that , for most , death " is not the worst thing that 's going to happen			1
" " we do n't know what dying is , " says @entity62			2
" whatever your religious background , it 's easier for us to ignore death and pretend that it does n't happen than to accept it as an unknown with all the other unknowns -- in this day and age there are a lot of them -- and deal with what we can and not be so spooked			2
