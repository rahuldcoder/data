-- things have n't been going great for @entity2 the last few days : she 's been dropped from the @entity5 , @entity6 is " reviewing the relationship , " and her biggest defenders so far have been her sons â € ” and their examples left a lot to be desired			1
but @entity2 has got at least one public figure in her corner : @entity14			1
the vampire author took to her own @entity17 page to defend the chef , but her comments ( first discovered by @entity20 ) are likely to just cause more controversy			2
@entity22 first posed the question to her readers by saying : " what 's happening with @entity2 ? is it fair ? i never heard of her until today , and wow , this looks like a crucifixion			1
opinions , thoughts welcome ...			0
are n't we becoming something of a lynch mob culture ? " @entity6 is ' reviewing business relationship ' with @entity2 she then decided that the " opinions , thoughts " needed were her own , and had quite a bit to say in the comments , including , in part , " ... this woman is just what you said			1
she 's an old southern lady , and she never made these unwise remarks of hers to a black person			2
we have no evidence at all that she has ever personally insulted or injured any black employee or friend			0
" no evidence , of course , except @entity2 's own sworn deposition about the offense level of jokes			1
" i ca n't , myself , determine what offends another person , " @entity2 said before going on to explain how she wanted to hire " all black waiters for her brother 's 2007 wedding			2
" @entity2 releases statement after being dropped from @entity5 @entity22 continued her defense in the court of public opinion , via @entity17 : " it 's so easy to persecute an older , overweight , unwise , crude , ignorant woman who may very well be a good person at heart who has achieved a great deal in her life			1
so easy to vilify her and hate her and try to destroy her life			0
woe to anyone today who is not slender , young , clever and politically correct			0
" @entity2 will finally be giving her own side of the story on the " today " show wednesday			2
