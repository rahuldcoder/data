-- thinking about donning a kimono to dress like a geisha for @entity3 , or a @entity5 mariachi suit ? students from @entity7 have a message for you : " we 're a culture , not a costume			1
" with ethnic and racial stereotypes becoming increasingly popular @entity3 costume themes , members of the school 's @entity15 are launching a campaign to make revelers think twice before reducing a culture to a caricature , the group 's president said			1
posters from the campaign are expected to go up on the @entity25 , @entity7 , campus wednesday			1
meanwhile , the images are making the rounds online , raising debate over whether it 's ever ok for people to paint their faces black , impersonate a racial stereotype for fun , and where to drawn the line			1
it 's a seasonal point of controversy , but even after widely publicized controversies such as the " @entity44 " wig at @entity39 's and @entity41 's illegal alien jumpsuit , costumes of stereotypes abound			2
on @entity48 's shopping section , several pages of " @entity5 costume ideas " are available , from " @entity5 donkey costumes " to sexy serapes and tequila shooter girls			0
the ad campaign from @entity7 show students holding photos of different racial and ethnic stereotypes in costume : an @entity59 guy with a picture of the @entity5 donkey costume , an @entity63 girl with an image of a geisha , a @entity67 student with a photo of a white guy wearing a traditional ghutra and iqal over his head , bombs strapped to his chest			1
" during @entity3 , we see offensive costumes			1
we do n't like it , we do n't appreciate it			0
we wanted to do a campaign about it saying , ' hey , think about this			2
it 's offensive , ' " said senior @entity81 , president of stars			0
" the best way to get rid of stereotypes and racism is to have a discussion and raise awareness , which is what we want to do with this campaign , " said @entity81 , who is black and plans on dressing as singer @entity84 for @entity3			1
the most obvious offense occurs when someone who 's not black decides to go blackface , because of the historical context , she said			0
but the message applies to all races and stereotypes -- and not just during @entity3			1
the dean of students fully supported the campaign , calling it a " clean , succinct " way of delivering an important message			1
" we 've always tried to get a handle on what it means to be thoughtful and appropriate when it comes to talking to students about choosing costumes and making the best decisions for celebrating @entity3 , " @entity104 said			1
" i think it 's a clean way of raising awareness of how the costumes you choose might be offensive			2
in many cases , students are n't doing it maliciously , but they might not realize the consequences of their actions on others			2
" the campaign has gone viral , landing on blogs and other schools ' online publications			1
so far , the response in the editorial sections has been positive			2
but in the comment sections , not everyone thinks it 's a message that needs to be reinforced			0
" suddenly , i am overcome with the urge to dress up as the @entity136 this year , " one comment on the @entity133 's piece on the campaign said			0
" guys & girls -- @entity3 is just bit of fun			1
dead guys do n't come back to life and eat people			0
there are no hot blonde lady cops in tiny uniforms that demand to ' frisk ' you			0
kimonos are ok even if ' @entity149 ' do n't wear them on a daily basis			0
" but others think it 's a message that needs to be repeated			0
" i think it 's almost impossible to be ironic while being racist , so irony is lost , " said @entity153 , a professor of @entity155 studies at @entity156 and the author of " @entity158 : @entity161 and the @entity162			0
" " to treat a character like @entity164 or @entity165 as a @entity3 costume is one thing , but to treat an entire ethnicity as a costume is something else			2
it suggests that people conflate the actual broad diversity of a culture with caricatures and characters			0
" while @entity179 - @entity178 can be stereotyped as gangsters and @entity181 - @entity178 as hard drinkers , there are no pervasive stereotypes for whites on the same level that allow for them to be caricatured as a @entity3 costume , @entity153 said			1
" the more we look at people as caricatures , the harder it is to operate as democracy , " he said			0
" what underlies this kind of costuming is the belief that these people are n't quite equal to what we are or are n't as @entity178 as we are , or that you as a person who 's not a member of that group should be able to dictate how painful the stereotype should be			0
