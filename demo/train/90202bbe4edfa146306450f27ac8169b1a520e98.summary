-- @entity1 : why the @entity2 fights background checks a more powerful @entity2 today is in no mood to follow the slogan of their " be reasonable " ad campaign of 14 years ago			1
this relatively small group -- the @entity2 boasts that it has 4.5 million members , which is peanuts compared to the roughly 40 million @entity12 members -- might have the political power to pull it off			0
federal law prohibits selling guns to felons or the mentally ill. background checks are the only way to enforce that law			1
so , besides criminals and the insane , who could possibly oppose universal background checks ? gun manufacturers			1
they are the ones who call the shots at the @entity2 , and they are the most important people in the opposition			0
the manufacturers do n't want anything that interferes with total gun sales and profits			1

@entity39 : the government wants your gun rights @entity43 is debating legislation that will limit @entity45 ' right to keep and bear arms and infringe on the right to privacy			1
the @entity49 was made part of our @entity51 explicitly to protect freedoms : the freedom of speech , protection against searches without a warrant , the right to trial by jury and the right to protect oneself with a firearm			0
i am compelled to stand up for every amendment and right enumerated in the @entity51			1
senate majority leader @entity66 is attempting to push forward with gun control legislation			2
the chief problem i have is that nothing in this legislation would have prevented the terrible massacre in @entity72 , @entity73			0
i am open to ideas that would help prevent tragedies , but this legislation would not have saved us from the national heartbreak of the december school shooting			0

@entity87 : give gun owners what they want the politicians called out by [ @entity93 ] @entity92 and [ @entity95 ] @entity94 let the @entity2 bully them into thinking that gun owners do n't want key flaws in our current gun laws fixed and that you ca n't win elections without the backing of the @entity2			2
the millions of dollars the @entity2 spent in unsuccessful attempts to win close @entity83 races in swing states with high gun ownership rates -- @entity106 , @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 -- suggests that candidates can and do win despite strong @entity2 opposition			2
the @entity2 portrays itself as an organization that speaks for and advocates for gun owners			2
the reality is that they speak for gun owners with the most extreme views and for the gun industry			2
a case in point is their opposition to requiring background checks for all firearm sales			1

@entity131 : gun control or carry permit wo n't stop mass murder if one thing is predictable about mass shootings , however , is that they will spark arguments from gun control advocates and gun rights groups alike			2
both sides of the gun issue will probably view this tragedy [ shooting at @entity144 , @entity145 ] as one more example of why more or less gun control is the answer ... and both sides will be wrong			1
tighter restrictions on gun purchasing -- for example , eliminating multiple gun sales and closing the gun - show loophole -- may help reduce @entity45 's gun violence problem generally , but mass murder is unlike most other forms of violent conflict			1
@entity160 killers are determined , deliberate and dead - set on murder			2
they plan methodically to execute their victims , finding the means no matter what laws or other impediments the state attempts to place in their way			0
to them , the will to kill can not be denied			0

" @entity179 : the case for gun rights is stronger than you think many people agreed with me and sent me examples of their son or daughter 's school that had armed security guards , police officers or school employees on the premises			1
many others vehemently disagreed with me , and one dissenter even wrote that the blood of the @entity73 victims was ultimately on the hands of pro-gun rights advocates			0
to that person i would ask : suppose the principal at @entity201 who was killed lunging at the gunman was instead holding a firearm and was well - trained to use it			2
would the result have been different ? or suppose you had been in that school when the killer entered , would you have preferred to be armed ? evidence and common sense suggest yes			0

@entity222 : gun violence is a national security issue the proliferation of semiautomatic weapons in the hands of @entity45 of the types that were used in the @entity72 massacre is sometimes framed as a public health issue in the @entity45			1
there is considerable merit to the notion of treating gun violence as a public health matter			2
after all , homicides -- around 70 % of which are accomplished with firearms in the @entity45 according to an authoritative study by the @entity240 -- are the 15th leading cause of death for @entity45			1
but framing gun control as a public health issue does n't quite do justice to the problem			1
it 's probably more or less inevitable that most @entity45 will die of cancer or a heart attack , but why is it even plausible that so many @entity45 in elementary schools , colleges , movie theaters and places of worship should die at the hands of young men armed with semiautomatic weapons ? @entity45 generally regard themselves as belonging to an exceptional nation			1
and in terms of living in a religiously tolerant and enormously diverse country , @entity45 can certainly take some justified pride			1

my husband hunts and believes strongly in his right to bear arms			1
but when my 25 - year - old middle son @entity282 shot himself in a moment of despair last april , i came full circle to the harsh reality that there are almost twice as many suicides as murders by firearm across @entity45 , roughly 19,000 of the 30,000 gun deaths each year			1
yet we disproportionately fear and almost exclusively talk of criminals in this national gun debate			1
my introduction to guns came on a hot summer day in 1963 when my father , 53 sent us all out of the house to have an afternoon of fun at a swimming pool in @entity302 , @entity303			2
he called police , wrote " i 'm sorry " on a scrap of paper and shot himself in our basement			0

listening to president @entity347 's news conference on thursday marking 100 days after @entity348 , and the whole gun control debate , prompted me to get my viewpoint across			1
he of course was a firm believer in his right to bear arms			1
this posed no issue until our son was born			0
i was adamant that no gun be allowed in our home , while he felt quite the opposite			0
we agreed on one gun locked in a safe , and his other hunting guns were stored at his parents			2
