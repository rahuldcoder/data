-- in the 1980s , @entity1 was the face of fitness for millions of @entity4			1
" the @entity7 " became the highest - selling home video ever , with more than a million copies purchased			1
since then , @entity1 has produced and starred in over 20 home exercise tapes and dvds			1
after a 15 - year hiatus , the oscar award - winning actress returned to the fitness field with the goal of helping baby boomers feel better and stay active			1
her latest dvd , " @entity16 : @entity17 for @entity18 , " releases tuesday			1
@entity1 turns 75 later this month			1
we spoke with her monday about aging , eating and living life abundantly			1
q : when you released your first workout tape in 1982 , did you have a sense of how big a phenomenon you were on to ? i did not have a clue			1
i did n't realize the role timing would play in the whole thing			1
there was no video industry			1
i did n't know anyone who owned a video , because no one could afford the hardware to play a video			1
and there was no video that beckoned people to do it over and over and over again until that tape came out			1
that 's what caused the video industry to explode ... it was all very synergistic ... it had no strategic thought on my part			2
q : how do you stay motivated ? what motivates me is how good i feel afterwards			2
( @entity53 ) i do n't wake up saying " oh goody , i am going to work out			2
" but i do it because of how it makes me feel when it 's over			2
if i 've felt depressed or down at all , it picks me up and makes me feel great			2
q : do you feel you have to do as much as you did 10 years ago ? absolutely not , no. i ca n't do what i used to do			2
my body just would n't tolerate what i used to do			2
( @entity1 has had hip and knee replacement surgeries			1
) the mistake that so many people make is that if they ca n't do what they once did , then they do n't do anything			2
it 's important just to do something			2
if you ca n't run , walk			0
... if you ca n't lift heavy weights , so lift light weights			0
but just keep yourself physically active			0
it makes all the difference not just for your body , but for your brain as well			0
q : what do you eat ? i eat fish , chicken and eggs			0
i eat red meat maybe twice a week			0
but when you are older , it is very important what you eat because your cells regenerate more slowly and also you put on weight more easily because you have less muscle than you used to , so every single calorie you put in your body has to count for something			0
i try to eat something dark green , dark purple , red , orange , yellow , white , because they all have different vitamins and minerals in them			0
q : what foods do you avoid at all costs ? well , i am not a purist			0
now that the @entity109 holiday is coming , i will take a bite of a pecan pie , but i wo n't eat a whole pecan pie			0
i will take a few bites of the dressing , but i will eat a lot of the turkey			0
@entity118 meat is so good			0
i will eat it with cranberry sauce and gravy			0
but i try to eat less of the very fattening food and more of the really healthy food			1
q : what do you think is the secret to a well - lived life ? i think it 's more important to be " interested " than to try to be " interesting			0
" i 've always remained interested and curious and i 've always been a student as well as a teacher , so i think that 's key			0
also being intentional ... living an intentional life ... thinking about who you are , how you affect other people , how you are perceived in the world and how you can change that to be more positive -- instead of sort of just drifting along like a leaf in the river , being really intentional about how you live			1
when you do yoga , you can do the poses thinking about the grocery shopping or what you are going to do tomorrow , or you can be intentional ... in the moment , being present in what you are doing			1
that 's how to get the most out of life and learning			0
that has been very important to me .			0
