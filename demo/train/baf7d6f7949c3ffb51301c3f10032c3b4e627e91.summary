president @entity0 said monday that the @entity1 has asked @entity2 to return a @entity1 drone aircraft that @entity2 claims it recently brought down in @entity2 territory			1
" we 've asked for it back			1
we 'll see how the @entity2 respond , " @entity0 said in a news conference , alongside @entity9 prime minister @entity8			1
a top @entity2 military official previously vowed not to return the unmanned @entity1 stealth plane that it says it has			1
" no nation welcomes other countries ' spy drones in its territory , and no one sends back the spying equipment and its information back to the country of origin , " said gen. @entity15 , deputy commander of @entity2 's military , the semi-official @entity14 news agency reported sunday			1
" it makes no difference where this drone originated and which group or country sent it to invade our airspace , " @entity15 said			0
" this was an act of invasion and belligerence			0
" shoes thrown at @entity2 's president former @entity1 vice president @entity38 on monday criticized @entity0 's decisions on the drone , but for an entirely different reason			1
he said that , after the aircraft went down , the president should have ordered an airstrike over @entity2			1
" the right response to that would have been to go in immediately after it had gone down and destroy it , " the @entity45 , who served with president @entity46 , told @entity48 's @entity47			0
" you can do that from the air ... and , in effect , make it impossible for them to benefit from having captured that drone			0
" instead , " he asked nicely for them to return it , and they are n't going to , " @entity38 said			1
@entity1 officials have not confirmed that the drone shown in a video released last thursday by @entity2 media is a @entity1 aircraft			1
but @entity69 spokesman @entity68 has said that an @entity1 drone is missing and had not been recovered			1
two @entity1 officials have confirmed to @entity48 that the missing drone was part of a @entity75 reconnaissance mission that involved both the intelligence community and military personnel stationed in @entity78			2
@entity2 's official @entity79 said the country 's armed forces had downed the drone near @entity83 , some 225 kilometers ( 140 miles ) from the border with @entity78 on december 4			1
@entity15 said downing the plane was " very valuable for us " and " a victory for us and a defeat for our enemies , " @entity79 reported			0
he also said @entity2 had downed other drones earlier but had not announced those instances because they were not as important			2
@entity2 tv has aired images of what it says is the drone , an apparently intact @entity98 drone propped on a pedestal and triumphantly displayed			1
one @entity1 official said the @entity1 ca n't be certain it 's the real stealth drone , because @entity1 personnel do n't have access to it			2
but he added there 's no reason to think it 's a fake			0
however , a second senior @entity1 military official said that a big question is to how the drone could have remained virtually intact given the high altitude it is believed to have crashed from			2
the condition of the drone in the video suggests it was not shot down but suffered a system failure , aviation analyst @entity112 said			0
there are no burn marks from a fire , no holes and no outward damage			0
@entity112 noticed a dent along the leading edge but does n't know what that means			0
" it 's fairly clear here from the pictures that the outer wings have been separated			0
the question is , did that happen in the accident or ( did they take ) them off to move the aircraft ? " @entity112 asked			0
@entity2 's @entity137 ambassador said in a letter last week that the drone flew 250 kilometers ( 150 miles ) into @entity2 territory " to the northern region of the city of @entity143			2
" the letter from @entity146 @entity145 to @entity137 @entity147 and the heads of the @entity149 and @entity150 said the drone " faced prompt and forceful action " by the armed forces			0
" my government emphasizes that this blatant and unprovoked air violation by the @entity1 government is tantamount to an act of hostility against the @entity2 in clear contravention of international law , in particular , the basic tenets of the @entity163 , " @entity145 's letter said			2
he called for @entity137 condemnation of @entity1 " acts of aggression , " as well as " clear and effective measures to be taken to put an end to these dangerous and unlawful acts in line with the @entity163 ' responsibilities to maintain international and regional peace and security			0

@entity38 says @entity0 should have ordered a strike to destroy the fallen drone
" we 've asked for it back . we 'll see how the @entity2 respond , " @entity0 says
an @entity2 military general says @entity2 wo n't send back " the spying equipment "
the @entity69 says it lost contact with a drone and has not recovered it
