-- if this long - delayed and blatantly pandering @entity6 malarkey is anything to go by , @entity2 's current craze for fairy tales is n't going to have a happy ending			1
originally slated for release last spring , " @entity10 : @entity16 " was ostensibly pushed back to take advantage of @entity13 's rising star ( he had " @entity14 " and " @entity15 " coming out in the summer )			1
@entity13 is entitled to cash in on his " @entity18 " acclaim and make a living like anybody else , but i 'll bet he was more animated cashing his check than he is as a gun - toting medieval witch slayer , the little boy from @entity26 's fairytale grown up with a chip on his shoulder and an inexplicable @entity30 accent ( which is shared by his " sis , " @entity33 's leather - clad @entity32 , but no one else in this neck of the woods )			1
@entity10 is also inflicted with diabetes -- " sugar sickness " -- and periodically slumps into a coma until he self - administers an injection through his britches			0
you 'll know how he feels			0
the idea may be kind of cute -- remember @entity10 was force - fed candy as a kid -- but typically half - baked in a flick that throws anachronisms around like they 're going out of style			0
writer - director @entity50 , whose first film was the cult @entity53 zombie pic " @entity54 , " has n't concocted more than a slender thread of a narrative			1
a witch is snatching so many children that the town mayor brings in the sibling celebrity bounty hunters ( wait a minute , did n't @entity61 all ready make this movie as " @entity26 " ? )			1
rather than construct any scares , suspense or surprise , the movie attempts to stave off boredom with a dose of kung fu fighting every five minutes			0
the movie hits its nadir early , when @entity73 's teenage fanboy , @entity72 , shows up in a tavern bearing press clippings of the dynamic duo 's exploits and asks for their autographs -- slipping in some bonehead exposition for good measure : " so how do you kill witches ? " it never really improves much either -- except maybe in the gratuitous semi-nudity when a mildly wounded @entity10 is coaxed into skinny dipping in " healing waters " by a comely maiden who leads by example			2
playing the wickedest witch ( " @entity93 " ) , whose true features resemble the @entity96 , @entity91 signals her wickedness by			1
which has the unfortunate consequence of underlining the @entity101 © d nature of lines like " i 'm not			0
sy ! " yes indeed , too easy by far , when @entity50 seems to specialize in the heavy - handed , cumbersome and laborious , even when he 's aiming for flip			2
especially when he 's aiming for flip			2
it 's a tossup what 's most depressing , the abject storytelling ( and when you find yourself yearning for the storytelling skills of @entity61 , that 's not a good sign ) or the reprehensible , lazy thinking that equates evil with physical deformity			0
look how we 're invited to enjoy the slaughter of witches -- including conjoined twins and a " half lady " -- and how @entity123 insidiously mixes sideshow freaks with the reactionary connotation of the word : the witches are made up to resemble goths and punks , outsiders who deserve nothing better than the gory reckoning he contrives for them			0
as for shooting the thing in @entity137 , the movie has some eye - catching effects			1
it 's just a pity @entity50 and company never see the wood for the trees .			0
