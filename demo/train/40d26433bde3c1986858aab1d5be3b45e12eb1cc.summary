-- a recently built superyacht suggests that at least some wealthy holiday makers are demanding more from their sailing trips than just exotic islands and sun - drenched sea decks			2
the 74 - meter rv @entity8 comes with the usual roster of flat - screen tvs , designer furniture and en - suite bathrooms , but a closer inspection reveals that it also doubles as a fully - fledged floating laboratory			1
indeed , @entity16 's " rv " designation stands for " research vessel " , and the boat is equipped with a five - man submarine , a decompression chamber for deep sea diving and a small team of marine biologists			1
@entity24 is the chief executive of the yacht 's managing company , @entity25			0
he explains that anyone who charters the yacht can have as much or as little involvement in the research as they like , with the one condition that they always allow a group of scientists to travel with them			1
@entity24 believes demand for boats of this type represent a growing trend within the yachting community , where people are looking for something more than just a hedonistic getaway			1
" the historic perception of the superyacht set is the south of @entity47 , drinking champagne and having a lovely time , " he said			2
" but suddenly people are going : ' hang on a second			0
i can go somewhere further afield and be a part of something bigger			2
' " this is about getting the most out of time and also feeling as though they 're doing some good , " he added			0
according to @entity60 of the @entity61 ( @entity62 ) , the boat is owned by an accomplished diver and marine preservationist who wishes to keep his identity private			2
" this is his fourth vessel			2
he 'd already been yachting for 15 years and traveled around the world twice , " claimed @entity60			0
" it was at that point he said : ' let 's do something different			0
' " the boat 's original dining area was converted into a lab and fitted with scientific equipment capable of everything from tagging endangered marine life to monitoring water pollution levels			1
as well as the decompression chamber , the vast array of diving equipment on board rv @entity16 includes a machine that produces high - quality oxygen -- allowing trained guests to dive deeper , longer and safer			1
one of the biggest draws -- for guests and scientists -- is the five - person submarine on board			1
weighing 14 tons , managing company @entity25 claim it 's the world 's only privately owned diver - lockout sub , allowing divers to enter and leave underwater via different chambers and explore depths few others have ventured before			0
such experiences can be transforming			0
@entity60 recounts the journey of a guest aboard a similar research vessel in the @entity103 , just off @entity104 , who helped scientists tag giant manta rays in an effort to track their migration patterns			1
the vital data was packaged into a video that the guest then presented to the president of @entity104			0
" he was able to help conduct important research that will have a lasting impact			1
and as he kept telling us , this was the best trip he 'd ever had , " said @entity60			0
but all this worthy enterprise does nothing to distract from the luxury embellishments at hand on @entity124			0
true to its owner 's vision of combining high - level research with opulence fit for a sultan , guests who are not otherwise tagging hammerhead sharks or monitoring the breeding habits of whales , can enjoy comforts that include an eight - person spa pool , bar , cinema , gym and extensive observation lounge			1
" when we do trips with our clients , they still like wonderful meals , they still like massages , they still like the luxury of living aboard a superyacht , " said @entity60			2
" but we 've got a whole other layer of richness you just ca n't get from your average superyacht			0

introducing @entity8 , a *73.6m* superyacht *boasting* a science lab and submarine
marine scientists on board conduct research , from tagging species to monitoring water
part of a growing trend of *meaningful* *expeditions* , rather than hedonistic getaways
research vessel includes superyacht comforts such as cinema , spa , *helicopter* pad
