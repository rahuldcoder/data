@entity0 -- former @entity3 president @entity2 was remanded in custody for two weeks saturday by an anti-terrorism court over allegations he illegally ordered the detention of judges in 2007			1
his appearance had been ordered by @entity3 's @entity10 , which on thursday ruled that his alleged actions amounted to an act of terrorism			0
after a 20 - minute hearing , the anti-terrorism court in @entity0 placed @entity2 on judicial remand for 14 days			1
his next court appearance in the case is set for may 4			0
as the former president left the court , there were clashes between anti-musharraf lawyers and a small @entity25 crowd			2
authorities decided @entity2 will be held under house arrest at his farmhouse compound in @entity29 , outside the @entity3 capital			1
he will be moved from police headquarters , where he was whisked after his court appearance , to the farmhouse , police officials said			1
the farmhouse has been converted into a " sub jail , " @entity2 's lawyer , @entity35 , said friday			2
@entity2 spent friday night at police headquarters following his appearance before a magistrate earlier in the day , after which he was initially allowed to return to the farmhouse			1
@entity2 will continue to seek bail in the case , his lawyer said			2
an attempt on thursday to appeal the @entity10 's decision at the @entity46 appeared to have so far been unsuccessful			0
the former president denies the charges against him and never gave any order to detain or abduct the judges in 2007 , said @entity51 , a spokesman for his political party			1
the development is the latest setback for @entity2 since the former military ruler returned to @entity3 last month to fight a series of court cases against him and re-enter the country 's turbulent political scene by seeking to run in upcoming elections			1
his arrest highlights the increased willingness of @entity3 's judiciary , which clashed with @entity2 during his time in power , to pursue cases against high - profile figures previously considered to be untouchable			1

but so far , his return does not seem to be going according to plan			0
last week , @entity3 election officials barred him from running for a seat in parliament in elections next month , a decision his lawyer has said he will challenge			0
the ex-military strongman still has to face two separate other cases dating from his time in power			0
the first relates to claims he did not do enough to protect the life of @entity90 -- the first woman to be elected prime minister of @entity3 -- after she was assassinated in 2007 , weeks before an election in which she hoped to return to office			2
@entity2 is also accused of ordering his troops to kill @entity96 , a popular tribal leader , in the volatile province of @entity98 , in 2006			1
