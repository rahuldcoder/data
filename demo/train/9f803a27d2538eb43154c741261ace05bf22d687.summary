-- it 's called a document dump			0
in this case , 175 pages of contractors ' internal updates on the beleaguered @entity7 website were blasted out wednesday night by rep. @entity11 's @entity10 - led @entity9			1
you can read it all online			0
but we read it so you do n't have to , poring through the jargony , technical documents ( " @entity19 is now @entity20 " ) , to give you another option -- the five things you need to know : related : @entity22 launch may have been worse than first reported 1			1
low - tech options failed too in the first weeks of the @entity22 sign - up , the two low - tech options for @entity25 -- the call center and paper applications -- struggled and sometimes froze			0
an october 8 entry about the number of paper forms turned in at that point simply said " 500 applications ... but ca n't process any because of log - in and other issues			1
" by october 16 , some 3,000 paper applications were in the processing center but only " 81 have been successfully entered			0
" a tough decision emerged : should navigators -- those who help people sign up -- recommend that folks leave the slow website and send in a paper form ? or would that matter ? contractors wrote they were waiting on the @entity47 to decide			1
by october 15 , contractors were recommending the paper applications , documents show			1
meanwhile , the call center was getting high marks for low wait times and professional operators , but an october 3 note reads : " 50 % of call center calls have issues			1
" the problem was with a technical interface to check people 's identities			0
four days later , a more basic issue : " our call center reps ca n't see their screens , " wrote an unnamed consultant			0
in response , the @entity47 told @entity0 that these are contractor notes that only depict the state of the website in its first days			1
" we have made significant progress , " said @entity47 spokeswoman @entity70			0

it 's all about the 834s in a document full of figures and consultant - speak , one number stands out : 834			0
that 's the code for the final step in the @entity7 process , when all the data entered is sent to the insurance company a user has chosen			1
it sets up the actual insurance policy and hands off responsibility to the company or organization running that plan			1
but from the start , that data was not transferring correctly			1
" 834 issue - raised here as well - issuers not receiving 834s that they should be getting , " a contractor wrote on october 3			0
at one point no one could track whether the final 834 data entered by individuals was actually the same as the 834 data going out to insurers			1
related : @entity10 focuses on overall @entity22 troubles , not just website 3			2
a small group of contractors was key reading these pages feels almost voyeuristic			1
it 's a bit like hovering in the back of the main conference room for @entity7			1
problems are listed , tasks to respond to are handed out crisply and clearly			2
and from the back of the room , you notice something			0
those tasks go to a small core group of top coordinators , representing different companies and pieces of the process			1
the documents refer to those generally on a first - name basis , but not that many names appear			2
two dozen or so people -- @entity129 , @entity130 , @entity131 , @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 at @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 and others -- had a lot of work on their plates			0

" there was a fix regarding residency for @entity156 and @entity157 that was not fixed correctly and is denying ... 90 % of people based on residency , " the war room notes from the day read			2
as the documents move on and issues are tackled one by one , sweeping problems continue to appear			1
october 9 : " a new problem in the system has been identified : for about 30 % of the 70,000 applicants , the system has skipped applicants through ' events ' that are required to complete the application			0
" in other words , nearly a third of applicants could n't fill out the form , because the website was skipping " events " or entries they needed to make			2

the devil was really in the details while big - picture problems erupted with @entity7 , hundreds of smaller but still urgent issues were flying from the volcano as well			1
a few examples : at one point , a software problem hit every application from a married couple			2
the program recorded each spouse as " unmarried , " not just an identity issue but a major data issue for insurers			2
for weeks , programmers fought a problem that initially blocked and later snagged naturalized citizens who needed verification from the @entity197			0
contractors spent almost two weeks sorting out how to handle weight loss surgery and whether insurance companies need to include that in all policies			1
