-- the ability to control a @entity3 desktop with a simple hand gesture could become reality sooner than we once thought			2
the @entity7 got a sneak peek at two @entity11 - developed @entity10 notebook prototypes with built - in @entity13 sensors			2
the system would allow for gesture recognition in portable devices for the first time			1
the prototypes " appear to be @entity19 netbooks " and " feature an array of small sensors stretching over the top of the screen where the webcam would normally be , " the @entity7 reported			0
@entity27 gesture control on a laptop could offer more interactive , @entity13 - style pc gaming , as well as new computer interfaces and ways to control one 's notebook			1
@entity11 opened up its @entity34 to developers in june , and recently said it would be bringing @entity13 to desktop pcs in 2012			0
the @entity13 console itself is already in 18 million households the world over			1
although @entity11 popularized it , the @entity27 gesture recognition space is rapidly becoming a hot area of innovation			1
another company , @entity44 , is working on similar technology aimed at the notebook market			0
using a different technology than what the @entity13 currently incorporates , the @entity44 system can sense motion as close as 5.9 inches away			2
and then there 's @entity52 and @entity53 , whose upcoming smart tvs have taken a cue from @entity11 , and will incorporate @entity13 - style gesture recognition , along with other forms of interface control like voice control , and touchscreen remotes			1
although @entity11 is demonstrating and testing this technology , finished @entity13 - based portable products may not come straight from @entity64 , but rather from developers or oems			1
@entity10 is set to debut in beta in february			0
we should start seeing finished @entity10 products ( notebooks and tablets ) arriving toward the middle and end of this year			0
