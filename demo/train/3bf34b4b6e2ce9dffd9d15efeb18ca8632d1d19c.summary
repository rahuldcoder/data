-- generations of rock hounds and miners have turned the earth in western @entity5 , looking to bring a special ruby , sapphire or emerald -- the " big three " of the gem world -- to the light			1
the passion started early for @entity13 , 53 , who operated a gem stand on weekends when he was a kid			1
" i always loved rocks , " said the @entity17 resident			2
for @entity22 , 90 , the world of spodumenes , hiddenite and beryl runs even deeper in his blood			1
his @entity25 family has been digging for them since the 1880s			2
the men 's interests became intertwined early this decade when they became partners on the @entity22 family farm , which grows corn along with its treasures below			1
they unearthed hiddenite , a rare pale - to - green mineral in the spodumene family , and other specimens			1
" we never found any good emeralds , " said @entity22			1
until that day in august 2009			0
" it was just a normal digging day , " said @entity22 , who used to grade roads before he retired			0
using a track hoe and other equipment , @entity13 worked his way down a hole in the earth and through a quartz vein , 14 feet below the surface			1
that 's when he found it			1
reaching below a crystal , he saw what looked to be part of a @entity55 bottle			0
it was an emerald crystal			1
a very big emerald crystal			1
some 310 carats of it			0
" @entity13 really had a time when he found that one , " recalled @entity22 , without a hint of understatement			2
dubbed the " @entity62 , " the gem has been trimmed to 64.83 carats and is called the largest cut emerald ever found in @entity65			1
it is being compared to an emerald that once belonged to @entity68			2
and it could be yours			0
the co-owners are selling it , perhaps by the end of the year			2
while rubies and sapphires are found near @entity77 , about 75 miles southwest of @entity78 , different gems lure residents and visitors to @entity25 , about 30 miles northeast of @entity81			2
the small town of @entity83 is named for @entity84 , who mined @entity65 's first emerald and hiddenite on the @entity22 property in the 1880s , said geologist @entity88			1
" emeralds are very rare in the world and only a few countries host emerald deposits , " @entity88 said			1
" @entity5 is lucky to have three known emerald districts , including the @entity83 district			1
" @entity95 , a geologist with the @entity96 , said emeralds are more likely to be found outside @entity65			1
most are from @entity98 , @entity99 , @entity100 and @entity101			0
according to @entity88 , emeralds ( a beryl colored by chrome and vanadium ) and the rarer hiddenite ( spodumene ) are together only in this part of @entity5			1
gems have created a cottage industry around @entity111 , with amateurs and mining operations working the soil			0
at @entity116 , options for the energetic are " digging , " " creeking " and " sluicing			0
" " we have people from everywhere , " said employee @entity118 , who said the region offers 63 types of minerals			0
mining has a significant impact on the state 's economy , with gem mining a small part of that , said @entity88 , who has 40 years ' experience in mineral exploration around the world			2
the presence of pegmatites , a form of igneous rock , is largely responsible for the number and quality of gemstones , he said			0
although the public 's imagination often revolves around precious gems and stones used in jewelry , including diamonds , collectors often come at gems from a different perspective			0
they may prefer a certain locality or type of gem , @entity95 said			2
" a serious collector may prefer an uncut crystal to a cut gem , " he added			1
@entity22 said his family used to open the farm to the public in the 1970s and into the 1980s			2
people paid $ 3 to dig by hand and foot ; no machinery was allowed			0
since then , the small mining operation has been private			0
failing eyesight has somewhat sidelined @entity22 , but he still has a penchant for the craft			0
" i like moving the dirt			0
" @entity13 , who also sells gems and operates an amethyst mine in @entity171 , and @entity22 have had the six - sided " @entity62 " crystal cut twice			1
it is now slightly wider than a quarter			0
they received a comprehensive analysis in early august , and are now marketing the stone			0
the emerald compares in size and quality to one surrounded by diamonds in a brooch once owned by @entity68 , who was empress in the 18th century , said @entity182 , a @entity183 gemologist who examined the stone			2
@entity182 told @entity184 that @entity186 's auction house in @entity183 sold that gem in april for $ 1.65 million			2
chips or cuttings that resulted from the faceting of " @entity62 " sold for between $ 10,000 ( 1.89 carats ) and $ 15,000 ( 2.36 carats ) , said @entity13			1
@entity13 , the son of a mica miner , said he would rate the quality of the gem an 8 on a 10 - point scale			2
its uniqueness and size , with color and clarity following , may put it in the area of the selling price for the @entity68 emerald , he said			1
generally , larger gems are more likely to have internal flaws and inclusions , said @entity95			0
but @entity207 , ceo of the @entity208 , who like @entity95 said he has not seen the stone , said those factors are not as critical as size and color			0
the @entity214 's biggest asset is that it is from an area not known for large emeralds , said @entity207			1
" if it was n't from @entity5 it would n't be creating the buzz it is now , " he said			1
standards for colored gems are not as exacting as for diamonds , he added			0
still , @entity207 said , it is a large stone with desirable color and a potential buyer may be drawn to it			0
" when you combine all those things it increases the rarity			0
" @entity207 said that comparing the emerald to the @entity68 gem is a stretch because the empress , who he described as a " jewelry hog , " was a person of special historic significance			1
@entity182 's report , which calls the " @entity245 " one of " the most important gemstones in @entity241 history , " mentions an 18.88 - carat pear - shape emerald , which until now was considered the continent 's most valuable cut emerald			1
" this is a monster by comparison , " said @entity95			0
" several people are interested in it , " said @entity13 , adding an unnamed museum has expressed interest			0
meanwhile , @entity13 and an assistant continue to operate at the @entity22 family farm			2
" @entity13 's emerald find is very exciting as it confirms that more large emeralds are still out there , " said @entity88			1
at 90 , @entity22 can savor the moment			0
" this is what i always dreamed to find , " he said .			0
