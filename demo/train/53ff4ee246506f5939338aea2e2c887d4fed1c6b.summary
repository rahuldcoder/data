-- every old - school journalist wants this assignment : test beer to see if it 's been watered down , as a recent class - action lawsuit in @entity6 claims			1
@entity0 conducted an independent lab test of @entity8 and related brands this week			1
the results ? @entity8 contained 4.94 % alcohol by volume , compared with 5 % stated on the label			1
@entity14 possessed 4.13 % , compared with 4.2 % stated on the packaging			0
and @entity16 showed 5.35 % , compared with the label 's 5.5 %			1
when told of the results , a spokesman for @entity19 , which brews the brands , reiterated the company 's stance that the lawsuit is " completely false " and " groundless			1
" @entity25 on beer : why i drink good beer " the sample test results you provided are well within the variability of the all - natural brewing process and all in full compliance with all alcohol labeling laws , as we noted , " @entity35 , vice president of brewing and supply for @entity19 , told @entity0			1
@entity38 , an attorney for the plaintiffs , said he was n't surprised by how @entity0 's results differed from the brewer 's figures			1
the lawsuit 's claims are partly based on internal information from former @entity19 employees , and the suit will be seeking the beer maker 's internal numbers on alcohol content , @entity38 said			1
" that 's the proof you should actually be asking for , " @entity38 told @entity0			2
the plaintiffs ' attorneys believe a bottle of @entity8 has 4.7 % alcohol instead of the label 's 5 % figure			1
over a year of brewing , that alcohol difference amounts to " tens of millions " of dollars in savings for the company , @entity38 said			1
" the most accurate data , as we discussed , is going to come from @entity19 because they do their testing six times per second , " @entity38 said			0
" and they use different technology , in fact , from the laboratories you used			0
" earlier this week , two @entity6 residents sued @entity19 , alleging the company waters down @entity8 and other beers " significantly " to boost profits			1
the class - action lawsuit alleges that the maker of the " @entity79 " has the technology to precisely control the amount of alcohol in its beers but adds water so the alcohol is well below the advertised figure of 5 % by volume , the suit said			2
" there are no impediments -- economic , practical or legal -- to @entity19 accurately labeling its products to reflect their true alcohol content , " the 18 - page lawsuit said			2
" nevertheless , @entity19 uniformly misrepresents and overstates that content			0
" the beer maker has rejected the lawsuit 's allegations and now points to media outlets ' independent tests to bolster its response			0
" the claims against @entity19 are completely false , and these lawsuits are groundless , " @entity35 said earlier this week			0
" our beers are in full compliance with all alcohol labeling laws			0
" we proudly adhere to the highest standards in brewing our beers , which have made them the best - selling in the @entity108 and the world , " he said			0
the brands that the suit alleges are watered down are those tested by @entity0 and @entity112 , @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 and @entity118			2
but the suit does n't provide figures for the allegedly watered - down alcohol content			0
@entity121 and @entity122 , who reside in @entity123 , @entity6 , are the plaintiffs who say they stopped buying @entity8 after learning of the alleged mislabeling , the suit said			2
their suit , filed last week in federal court in @entity130 , alleges violations of @entity6 's consumer protection laws and @entity134 's @entity133			0
" i think it 's wrong for huge corporations to lie to their loyal customers -- i really feel cheated , " @entity121 said in a statement			0
" no matter what the product is , people should be able to rely on the information companies put on their labels			0
" @entity0 's @entity145 and @entity146 contributed to this report .			2

@entity0 hires an independent lab to test samples of @entity8 and three related brands
@entity16 showed 5.35 % alcohol by volume compared with the label 's 5.5 %
@entity19 calls results " well within the variability of the all - natural brewing process "
but plaintiffs ' attorney says a *fraction* of less alcohol saves millions over a year
