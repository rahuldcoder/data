-- there was nothing about last friday 's biology department faculty meeting at the @entity5 in @entity6 that portended the carnage that was to come , professor @entity1 told a reporter wednesday			1
" it was actually a really laid - back , mundane kind of faculty meeting , " the biochemist told @entity0 affiliate @entity10 about the 13 people seated around an oval table in @entity13 of the @entity14			1
" events coming up , scheduling classes , budgets			2
it was really actually one of the easiest faculty meetings we 've had			2
" among the participants was @entity24 , a @entity25 - trained geneticist with whom @entity1 had developed a professional relationship nurtured by the fact that the two women worked with cell cultures			1
" sometimes you borrow things back and forth from each other , " she said			2
" we had talked about writing grant proposals together			0
" after about an hour , just before 4 p.m. , @entity24 -- who had recently been denied tenure -- ended the calm			1
" all of a sudden , she just stood up and shot , " @entity1 said			1
@entity1 reacted quickly , dropping onto her hands and knees on the gray carpet			1
" just dropped to the floor and crawled under the table and crawled towards @entity24 , " said @entity1 , who was focused on one thing			1
" i mean , you 're crawling under a table , you see the legs of a person who 's shooting above the table			2
i grabbed her leg and , i do n't know what i was thinking			1
i was n't thinking anything			2
i was just thinking : ' grab her ! ' " and she sidestepped me			1
i mean , she pulled her leg free and i was in the doorway then with my back kind of to her			1
and i think she tried to shoot at me then , but that 's when i started yelling at her , ' @entity24 , @entity24 , think about my grandson , think about my daughter ! this is me ! i 've helped you before ; i 'll help you again ! do n't do this @entity24 ! do n't do this ! ' " @entity24 then stepped out into the hall , pointed the gun at @entity65 and pulled the trigger , the biologist said			1
" it clicked , and it clicked again , and i crawled right back in the room and shut the door and she was left out in the hall			2
" the survivors burst into action			0
one person locked the wooden door , another shoved a table against it , others moved a refrigerator into place to further block the door , another called 911 , others moved to help the six people who had been shot , @entity1 said			1
three people died ; three others were wounded			0
two of them remained hospitalized wednesday in critical condition , according to a spokeswoman for @entity91			0
the third has been released			0
@entity1 , who joined the school 's faculty in 1984 , said the casualties have not affected her plans to remain at the school			1
and she rejected any suggestion that her role in getting @entity24 out of the room was heroic			1
" she followed me out in the hall and then the gun jammed and i could get back in the room , " @entity1 said			1
" that 's not being a hero			0
that 's just @entity108 looks out for you			0
" she said she had had little time to think			0
" from the beginning until we finally got things barricaded , it could n't have been more than 20 seconds , " she said			0
@entity1 further rejected suggestions that anything could have been done to protect the victims			1
" there was no way to ever anticipate this , " she said			0
" and there was nothing that could ever have been done to stop her			0
it all happened too fast			0
" and she worried that any attempt to tighten security could have negative consequences			0
" there is evil in the world ; it is unfortunate that good people are hurt by that			0
but a university is a place of free thought and freedom to explore ideas and to search out new knowledge and you do n't want to put anything in place that dampens that			0
" @entity1 returned to her office on wednesday and said she plans to resume teaching next week			2
she predicted that , with the help of anti-anxiety medication , she would be able to sleep wednesday night			0
" i 've been talking to family and friends and just getting their support helps you deal with it , " she said			0
" i think right now most of us want to get back there and get things going , make plans for who is going to cover classes			2
" a memorial service to honor the lives of the dead -- faculty members @entity162 , @entity164 and @entity165 -- is to be held friday .			2

@entity65 : " it was actually a really laid - back , mundane kind of faculty meeting "
