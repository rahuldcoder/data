-- january 28 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : northeastern @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 , @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity14 , @entity15 : fridays are awesome ! just like the students and teachers at @entity19 , where i had the privilege of speaking yesterday			1
i 'm @entity23 , bringing you 10 minutes of headlines , leaving out the commercials			1
let 's go ahead and get started			1
first up : @entity27 @entity28 : the financial crisis -- the one that sent a shockwave through the @entity4 economy and led to the @entity34 -- it could have been avoided			1
that 's what the final report from the @entity37 says			1
this group was put together by @entity40 in 2009 to try to figure out the causes of the crisis			1
it held hearings , it interviewed hundreds of people , and released its findings yesterday			1
the main conclusion : the crisis was avoidable			1
some political and financial leaders have argued that there was no way to see this crisis coming			1
but the commission says there were warning signs and those warnings were ignored or underestimated			2
the report puts part of the blame on major corporations , saying they did n't run themselves properly or take into account the risks of some of their business plans			1
it also blames government policies under both president @entity70 and president @entity71 , and some of the actions taken by the @entity73 as well			2
these conclusions come from the majority of the commission			2
three members wrote a dissenting , or opposing report , though			1
they say the majority report does n't study the causes of the crisis , that it 's just a list of things that went wrong			1
the dissenting report also argues that even if the government had gotten involved sooner , it might not have prevented the crisis because it was a global problem			1
@entity90 @entity28 : some of you who live in @entity7 or @entity93 might wish you could see snow more often			1
some of you live in @entity7 or @entity93 because you do n't want to see snow more often , and we 're guessing that a lot of people in the @entity99 are sick of it			1
that region is dealing with yet another strong winter storm			2
dangerous traffic conditions , canceled flights , closed schools			2
@entity106 reports on just how much snow is falling and just how bad everything has gotten			2
( begin video ) @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 : paralyzing roads and bringing bone - chilling winds , another winter storm has dumped more than a foot of snow in @entity119 's @entity118			2
@entity119 mayor @entity121 : when the snow stopped falling at about 4 a.m. , the official reading in @entity118 was 19 inches , breaking a record last set in 1925			2
@entity125 : in @entity128 , the weight of the snow caused a partial roof collapse at this garage			2
@entity131 , @entity132 , massachusetts mayor : there were about 15 people inside the structure when it collapsed			1
most of them have made it out under their own power			2
thank @entity141 everybody seems to be ok			2
@entity125 : officials say there was three feet of snow on top off the roof			2
@entity148 , @entity149 , @entity132 , @entity128 : we 've had a lot of snow and we 're gon na get more			2
buildings like this do n't get shoveled off , and we are just at the mercy of the construction of the buildings that people are working in			1
@entity125 : airports across the @entity99 are still trying to get back up to speed after hundreds of flights were cancelled			2
airports were shut down for hours while crews worked to clear runways thursday			2
and with schools closing in @entity112 , @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity119 and @entity168 , this storm pushed snow removal budgets over the limit			2
reporting from @entity112 , i 'm @entity106 for @entity0			1
( @entity172 ) @entity173 @entity174 , @entity15 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity177 's social studies class at @entity178 in @entity179 , @entity180 ! this man is the leader of what @entity183 country ? if you think you know it , then shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity5 , b ) @entity190 , c ) @entity192 or @entity193 ) @entity194 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! this is @entity196 , the president of @entity5			2
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! unrest in @entity5 @entity28 : president @entity196 is the leader of a country that 's in the middle of a political uprising			2
protests against the government have been going on all across @entity5 , and experts think there could be a lot more demonstrations starting today			2
the @entity209 , the largest group of protesters , is speaking out against president @entity196 's government			2
it 's telling its followers to protest in the streets after today 's weekly @entity209 prayers end			1
in some cases , protesters have fought with police officers			0
they 've thrown things at the security forces			0
and those forces have used tear gas to try to break up the crowds			0
at least three protesters and one police officer have been killed this week			0
social networking is playing a role in all of this , too			0
a lot of the protests are being organized on blogs and sites like @entity231 and @entity232			0
this day in history @entity28 : focusing on a single event in our " @entity237 " segment			0
on january 28th , 1986 -- exactly 25 years ago today -- the space shuttle @entity238 exploded less than two minutes after liftoff , killing all seven people on board			1
legacy of learning @entity28 : one of those seven people was @entity246			1
she was n't an official government employee , like most other astronauts			0
and she was picked from a group of more than 11,000 people in the field of education to journey into space			1
@entity255 shows us how , 25 years after @entity246 's tragic death , she 's still inspiring young people			1
( begin video ) @entity260 , @entity261 : the fifth graders at @entity263 in @entity264 , @entity265 know quite a bit about space			0
@entity268 student : i want to be able to drive rovers on @entity271			0
@entity268 student : i just recently learned from my brother that the constellations have moved , which is very interesting ! @entity274 : there 's a good reason			0
a picture of @entity246 , the first teacher in space , sits on a cabinet in the classroom			1
the kids know who she is not so much from history books , but from their teacher			0
@entity285 , teacher : the woman moaned			0
this tooth must come out			0
@entity274 : you see , their teacher @entity290 is connected to @entity246 in a way that simply can not fade over time			1
@entity285 : i feel very lucky to have known her , and i try very much to inspire my students			0
whatever your dream may be , it 's possible			0
@entity274 : a quarter century ago , @entity290 babysat @entity246 's kids and knew @entity246 from sunday school			1
a junior at @entity302 in @entity303 where @entity246 taught , she sat in the auditorium with other students that january morning			1
@entity285 : and then we heard , " @entity307 , go with throttle up			0
" @entity309 announcer : @entity238 , go with throttle up			0
@entity285 : and that phrase , " obviously there 's been a major malfunction			0
" @entity314 : flight controllers here looking very carefully at the situation , obviously a major malfunction			0
@entity285 : i think the realization hit us quite quickly that this is n't good			0
@entity274 : seventy - three seconds into the flight , @entity246 and the six other astronauts perished when @entity238 exploded			1
the accident was caused by bitter cold combined with a faulty rocket booster seal			0
but the tears that fell that day soon turned to a river of inspiration , leading @entity330 and many others to follow @entity246 's path			1
@entity285 : i think @entity246 would be very proud of the legacy she 's left			1
i think she would be ecstatic to know that her students went on to be teachers and were inspired by her			0
@entity274 : @entity246 called her flight the ultimate field trip			1
@entity246 , teacher - astronaut : i do n't think any teacher has ever been more ready			1
@entity274 : she never got to teach her lessons from space			0
but today , @entity330 is one of so many who teach because of @entity246			1
@entity255 , @entity0 , at the @entity344 in @entity7			1
( @entity172 ) blog report @entity28 : excellent and very inspiring story			1
well , i thought most of you would 've been against the idea of making it illegal to text while walking			0
and many of you were : just under 70 percent			0
but almost a third said this is n't such a bad idea			0
on our blog , @entity355 wrote , " there should be a law because if you 're walking across the street and not paying attention , someone could pull out and hit you			0
" but from @entity366 : " really , it 's the fault of the driver			0
drivers should keep their eyes on the road to see hazards like pedestrians			0
" @entity372 said , " it 's a good idea to have in bigger cities , but not for smaller towns , where there are few people and less drivers			1
" and over at @entity382 , @entity381 thinks " the idea of pedestrians not being able to text is crazy			0
people are responsible for their actions and should be prepared for any consequence			1
" and @entity386 writes , " i believe the proposal is fair			0
maybe instead of a law , there should be a three - count rule			0
get caught three times , then you get a ticket			0
" before we go @entity28 : okay , remember that mysterious island piano in yesterday 's before we go segment ? let 's play it again , sand			0
the mystery is solved ! a teenager says he 's the one who parked the grand piano out on this sandbar , with a little help from his friends and dad			0
he claims it was an art project for his future college applications			1
one man 's trash is another man 's art. in this case , it just happens to be the same man			0
goodbye @entity28 : authorities are n't planning to take any action against the piano prankster , so it 's nice that this grand mystery ended on a positive note			0
okay , today 's sign - off line from @entity232 / cnnstudentnews ? it came from just too many of you to count			0
but to you , from your anchorman : you stay classy , students ! wish i had a moustache for that ; that 'd be really awesome			0
