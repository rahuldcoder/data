-- just as there are many choices of drivers , putters , balls , and other equipment ; there are just as many choices of golf instructors			2
choosing the right golf instructor can help improve your game			1
the process of how you choose your golf instructor is as unique as your finger prints			1
however , just like there are certain things you want to know before choosing your doctor , there are certain items you should inquire of your instructor			2
compatibility - it is your responsibility to insure that there is a fit between you and your instructor on all levels , personality type , mutual goals , similar outlooks on the game , and your instructor 's ability to relate to your individual needs			1
before throwing a dart in the phone book under " golf instruction " , research the professionals in your area			2
one way is to ask friends and playing partners for referrals of good instructors in your area			0
ask them about pricing , reputation , location , and their improvement under the instructor 's tutelage			2
if you get along with your playing partners and the instructor does too , odds are you have found a fit			2
then , call the instructor and ask if they have time to talk to you about your game and improvement goals			1
a good instructor will be happy to talk to you about your game , and get to know you as an individual , prior to helping you with your golf game			1
accreditation and @entity71 - does your golf instructor have the education and experience to take your game to any level you desire ? many individuals claim to be golf instructors			1
many of these individuals are self - proclaimed " experts , " or had enough money to take a one to two week course on how to teach golf and make more money			0
in seeking a golf professional to help you with your game , insure that the individual has an active accreditation with the @entity87 or @entity88 , or , has demonstrated an inarguable ability to help players of many levels improve through many years of practice			1
other associations claim they produce golf instructors			0
however , these organizations have one focus , to make money , not to produce solid golf instructors			0
inquire of your instructor their accreditation , as well as their education both on and off the golf course			1
check with the @entity88 or @entity87 websites to confirm your potential golf instructor 's accreditation with that organization , and , how much experience the instructor possesses			1
inquire of the instructor 's philosophy and past success stories			0
if needed , ask for references of students from all skill levels that you can contact			0
video - video swing analysis has become a staple for all golf instruction			0
it is no longer an option			0
if you are paying for instruction that does not include video review of your game , you should reconsider why you are paying for golf instruction			1
video , when used correctly , is a third pair of eyes ( you and your instructor are first and second )			0
this is similar to a doctor using an x-ray or @entity135 , to diagnosis a health issue			0
your golf instructor should be using video in the same manner			1
@entity129 should confirm the diagnosis to you , not the instructor			0
a good golf instructor has the ability to see the flaw first , and use his or her knowledge of that flaw to diagnose a cure or drill for you to practice to realize improvement			1
if your golf instructor is relying solely on video to tell what is happening in your swing , you will eventually lose trust in the instructor 's ability to help you			2
you would second guess a doctor 's ability to help you if he or she did not use their ability first and confirm their thoughts with tests			0
then why would you rely on an instructor who is not " practicing " golf instruction in the same manner ? follow - up communication - your golf instructor should have a program available for you to utilize to ask questions , give feedback , receive follow - up instructions , schedule lessons , or make other inquiries after your lesson			2
some instructors offer their phone numbers after hours			0
others utilize the internet for follow - up and communication purposes			0
regardless of what form of communication is available to you after the lesson , your instructor should be available , at no extra charge , within a reasonable amount of time , to answer your questions and take interest in your concerns .			1

@entity195 hints from the @entity87 to help secure the right golf coach for your game
personality type and mutual goals are *crucial* to get the best from a coach
check your instructor has the education and experience to improve your game
your instructor should be available , at no extra charge , to answer concerns
