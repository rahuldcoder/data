the @entity1 siege has brought home some troubling truths to @entity4			1
they are not immune to the upheavals in the @entity7 , despite being on the other side of the world			1
they are as vulnerable as @entity11 or @entity12 to what are often called " lone - wolf " terror attacks			2
and recently - introduced anti-terror laws , while some of the toughest in the world , can only do so much			2
radicalized @entity4 have been drawn to @entity19 for many months , as well as to @entity21 's affiliate in @entity22 , @entity23			1
intelligence estimates put the number of @entity4 fighting with militant groups in the region at between 60 and 100			1
and long before @entity22 and @entity28 became the jihadists ' destinations of choice , @entity4 were among foreign militants converging on @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			1
besides those who leave @entity37 , there has been growing concern about networks which facilitate travel and raise money , raising the risk of attacks on the homeland			1
the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) estimates that around 100 people support jihadist groups in @entity22 and @entity28 , providing money or assisting with travel , for example			1
in july , when he was director - general of @entity45 , @entity51 told @entity37 's @entity52 : " we have been long , in my time , monitoring a small number of @entity4 who support violent extremism and who frequently express the aspiration of conducting terrorist attacks in @entity37			1
" high alert the @entity37 government raised the national terrorism alert to " high " in september , and an estimated 800 police officers were involved in a series of raids on addresses in the @entity1 area			1
during those raids , a 22 year old named @entity68 was arrested and later charged with plotting to behead members of the public			0
his lawyer has asserted @entity68 's innocence			2
@entity68 has since been charged with helping to fund travel for would - be jihadists to @entity22 and @entity28 , along with another man arrested monday			0
gallery : how @entity1 siege unfolded prosecutors allege that @entity68 had spoken by phone with a prominent figure in @entity19 -- @entity81			0
@entity81 's family emigrated to @entity37 from @entity83 in the early 1980s			1
as a young man , @entity81 was a nightclub doorman in @entity1 's red - light district and no stranger to drugs and alcohol			2
but then in 2009 came an epiphany : he rediscovered his religion			0
whether he was influenced by others or self - radicalized is unclear , but his path to militancy was rapid and dramatic			0
@entity81 left @entity37 , and after spending some time with @entity23 , he joined @entity19 and tried to get associates back home to carry out attacks , according to the federal police			1
unconfirmed reports suggest he may have been killed in october , though senior @entity37 officials say they have no confirmation that he is dead			1

now he is a senior figure within @entity21 affiliate , @entity23			0
@entity19 has encouraged followers and sympathizers to carry out attacks in their homelands			0
in september , the public face of the group -- @entity114 -- urged followers to kill " in any manner " citizens of countries who were part of the coalition against @entity19 , including a " disbelieving @entity119 or @entity12 -- especially the spiteful and filthy @entity120 -- or an @entity37 , or a @entity11 ... " solo attacks both @entity19 and @entity21 have urged followers in the @entity123 to carry out low - tech , solo attacks involving hostage - taking and the use of guns , as large - scale operations have become increasingly difficult to organize and execute			1
@entity21 in particular has repeatedly called on sympathizers to carry out " do - it - yourself " attacks			0
( the @entity133 marathon bombers used a " recipe " from an online @entity21 publication to build their devices			0
) besides the case against @entity68 , there have been other indications that the @entity37 homeland is not immune to acts of terror			1
in september , 18 - year - old @entity143 was shot dead by police after he repeatedly stabbed two police officers			0
his passport had recently been confiscated because of his alleged intention to travel to @entity22 or @entity28			0
some of the @entity4 who made the journey to @entity28 and @entity22 have been killed			1
at least one became a suicide bomber			0
@entity19 said in june that " @entity155 " had carried out a suicide bombing in @entity152 , killing himself and five others			0
he was later identified as an 18 - year - old from @entity158			0
among those reputedly recruited by @entity81 were a young couple from @entity161 , @entity162 and @entity163 , who were later killed in @entity164 in the midst of a battle between rival jihadist groups			1
her family described @entity162 as a normal teenager who had gone to nightclubs and studied graphic design			0
she had then fallen under the sway of the @entity174 movement -- a radical @entity176 preaching group in @entity1 -- and a cousin involved in @entity178 had arranged her marriage to @entity163 , who by then had already spent time in @entity33			0
the cousin later financed her travel -- via @entity182 -- to the @entity7			1
in an interview with the @entity185 , @entity162 's father @entity183 said his daughter " came and saw me before she left			2
i did n't know she was leaving , and she hugged me and she started to cry			0
" the jihadist pipeline from @entity37 to the region has gradually become more sophisticated , according to @entity191 , who follows jihadist activity among @entity4			1
" many of the @entity37 fighters prior to november 2013 appeared to be entering @entity22 with few pre-existing connections to armed groups , but since then two alleged recruitment networks have been uncovered , " @entity191 wrote in september 's @entity193 , published by the @entity194 at @entity195			1
in june this year , a 17 - year - old @entity37 of @entity202 origin named @entity203 vanished from his family 's home in a quiet suburb of @entity1			1
he told his mother he was going on a fishing trip			0
four months later , he fronted an @entity19 video , in which he threatened @entity37 prime minister @entity210			2
dressed in military - style fatigues and holding a rifle , @entity203 said : " we will not put down our weapons until we reach your lands , until we take the head of every tyrant and until the black flag is flying high in every single land			2
" anti-isis coalition @entity37 has contributed military support to the @entity223 coalition , and the government has been well aware of the threat of retaliation			1
it has massively beefed up funding for security and intelligence and enacted tough new anti-terrorism laws that include greater surveillance and search powers , as well as " control orders " that allow detention without charge in some terrorism - related cases			0
it is also now a criminal offense for @entity4 to travel to the province of @entity240 in @entity22 , the heartland of @entity19			2
foreign minister @entity241 says the passports of 75 @entity4 have been canceled this year			2
but for the intelligence services , detecting plans by would - be " lone wolf " attackers remains an immense challenge			0
the @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity11 have all seen such attacks			0
in the @entity11 case , the attacker had also been denied a passport			0
as @entity51 , then head of @entity45 , put it in july : " a recurring nightmare -- for me , anyway -- has been the so - called lone wolf , often radicalized over the internet and who has managed to avoid coming across our radar			2
" in the past two years , he said the situation in @entity22 and @entity28 had radically complicated the threat , " adding energy and allure to the extremist @entity266 narrative , " especially with the declaration of a caliphate			0
@entity37 now appears to have joined the long list of countries that have seen that threat translated into reality .			2
