@entity0 , @entity1 -- friends and family gathered sunday for an emotional prayer vigil for a missing 11 - month - old @entity1 girl as new surveillance video surfaced from the night @entity8 disappeared			1
the video , taken from a @entity11 gas station less than two miles from the home where @entity13 was last seen , shows an unidentified person walking along the road around 2:15 a.m. october 4			1
the station manager , @entity16 , said it 's unusual to see anyone walking at that time of night in the region			1
@entity16 , who shared the video with @entity2 on sunday , said he also turned it over to authorities investigating @entity13 's disappearance in hopes it will help in the search for the girl			1
the @entity27 and @entity0 police declined to comment on the video , citing the ongoing investigation			1
meanwhile sunday , @entity13 's parents , @entity8 and @entity8 , were seen wiping away tears at the candlelight vigil outside their home			1
they wore t - shirts emblazoned with @entity13 's image			1
@entity13 was reported missing at 4 a.m. october 4 , after @entity8 came home from work to find the door unlocked , the lights on and a window that had been tampered with			1
@entity40 said she last saw @entity13 at 6:40 p.m. the night before			1
a cadaver dog searching the family 's home indicated a positive " hit " for the scent of a body , according to documents released friday			2
the information was included in an affidavit , dated tuesday , police filed to request a search warrant of the home			2
the warrant was executed wednesday			0
" the cadaver dog indicated a positive ' hit ' for the scent of a deceased human in the area of the floor of @entity40 's bedroom near the bed , " the affidavit read			2
it also said that interviews with people involved in the case " revealed conflicting information " and that @entity40 told police she did not initially look for her baby behind the house because she " was afraid of what she might find			0
" the attorney for @entity13 's parents said the release of the affidavit friday was " unfortunate , " as it could derail the search for the missing girl			1
@entity78 described his clients as " very shaken up and they refuse to believe anything except that she is out there and alive			0
" he said @entity13 's parents are " terrified , not for themselves , but for the welfare of their daughter			1
" @entity40 said in an @entity89 interview last week that she was drunk the night the infant disappeared and that she had last seen the baby about four hours earlier than initially reported			2
@entity40 told @entity89 she is afraid she will be arrested			0
police have accused her of killing @entity13 , she said , and told her that she failed a lie detector test			2
" i was the last one with her , " a tearful @entity40 said			0
" and from judging on how the questioning went , that 's kind of a fear that i have			0
and the main fear with that is , if they arrest me , people are going to stop looking for her			0
and then i 'll never see her again , and i 'll never know what happened			0
" asked whether he had questions about @entity40 , @entity8 told @entity89 , " no. there 's no question to be had there			1
i know who she is			0
i know the kind of mother she is			0
" @entity110 said it 's possible someone could have entered the house without @entity40 hearing , as the couple 's bedroom is on the opposite corner of the house from @entity13 's room and @entity40 sleeps with a fan at high speed			1
@entity13 is described as being 30 inches tall with blue eyes and blonde hair , according to police			2
