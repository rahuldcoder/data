@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity1 commuters have an accident they do n't dial 911 or any ordinary emergency service			1
they call the country 's version of @entity9 , a heartthrob in the 1980s and 90s who turned his back on the film industry to run a fleet of ambulances and bury the nation 's dead			1
a household name in @entity1 , which is also known as @entity1 , @entity17 has starred in more than 200 films , and even took home a @entity21 in 1994 for best actor in " @entity23			1
" he followed it up with best director for " @entity26 " in 2003 , but by then his head had already been turned by the story of an old woman left to die alone in hospital			1
" the doctor warned the patient 's family that she was close to death			2
a few days later she passed away -- so this dead body had no owner , " @entity17 told @entity2 at this office on the outskirts of @entity0 , @entity1 's largest city			1
he later found out that the woman 's family could n't afford a funeral service			1
at the time , it was n't uncommon ; poor families would often sneak out in the dead of night to bury their dead , he said			2
and so began the @entity48 , founded in collaboration with multi-award winning late @entity1 writer and director @entity50 , which now also provides a free library , education , medical , dental care and disaster relief			1
from films to funerals @entity17 's decision to leave the film industry was n't entirely his own			1
in 2007 , he was arrested and later banned from the film industry after being accused of supporting the @entity63			2
that year , the @entity1 military staged a violent crackdown on the largest anti-government demonstrations since 1988			1
led by monks , tens of thousands of @entity1 marched through the streets to protest plans to cut fuel subsidies			1
@entity17 does n't deny that he helped them but says that the society 's policy of aiding people " regardless of social status , national and religion " meant that no one was turned away			1
he says he 's on better terms with the current government led by president @entity80 , who came to power in 2011 , ending 50 years of military rule			2
however , he says not enough is being done to repair the country 's patchy public services and protect the country 's poor			2
" we are showing the government what we need to do , " he said			0
he claimed the government is out of touch with what 's happening on the ground , as are foreign investors , who he says go straight to the capital @entity95 to listen to politicians rather than the people			0
" i want to make a suggestion : before they go to @entity95 they should meet the @entity101 and @entity102 who are really doing things for @entity1 so they know what 's really happening , " he said			1
" so after they meet with the @entity101 and @entity102 they 'll have information -- they 'll know the reality			0
so they can criticize and they can negotiate and they can discuss with the government and other parties			0
" he says other parties need to do more to deliver on their promises by using their own funding , rather than seeing him as a bank			0
a country on the mend ? @entity17 spoke with @entity2 as hundreds of delegates arrived in the country for the @entity125 on @entity126 , two days of talks on how the country can shake off the legacy of its past			1
as well as basic , if not non-existent , public services , the country is saddled with crumbling buildings , potholed roads , a patchy telecommunications network and an outdated electricity network that only services a quarter of the population of 60 million people			2
under the control of military leaders , @entity1 's economy stagnated so much so that in 1990 its per capita gdp growth was at a similar level to that recorded in 1900 , according to a recent report from @entity144			1
there 's much that needs to be fixed , but money is needed			0
@entity17 's society relies on donations and an army of volunteers -- around 500 a day -- who do everything from carrying caskets to preparing bodies for burial			1
trained doctors and nurses man the hospitals and clinics where patients are offered everything from eye surgery to maternity care and blood transfusions			0
the extent of their work can be seen in hundreds of laminated photos pinned on notice boards , which line the halls of the company 's headquarters			0
one shows a newly married couple -- still in their wedding clothes -- carrying a casket ; they came to volunteer straight after the service , he said			0
others show shots of aid workers digging wells and bringing supplies to cyclone - hit residents , students sitting learning in class and then , incongruously , a couple of images of mutilated bodies -- all part of a day 's work for the society			1
message to @entity1 people : ' please be united ' @entity17 may be incredibly popular in @entity1 , providing services that in many countries are promised by politicians , but he says he has no plans to enter politics			1
" no , " he said , shaking his head , " i have no ambition to make a political party			0
" he says his motivation is altruism ; he does n't need power , glory or adoration			0
" when we are giving the aid to the people , we do n't expect any kind of benefit or opportunity			0
when we help , if they 're happy , i 'm also happy			0
" he supports @entity217 laureate and leader of the @entity219 of @entity220 , @entity221 -- her image hangs on the walls of his office -- but says @entity1 's people need to drop their unquestioning admiration of @entity221 and her father , the late general @entity228 , and start following their lead			1
" people are not following their speech			0
they say we love @entity221 , we love general @entity228 ... but they 're not following their policy			0
they 're not implementing what they 're saying			0
this is the problem with @entity1 people			1
" @entity17 is dismayed by the outbreaks of ethnic violence around the country that have strained relations between @entity1 @entity245 and the minority muslim population			1
he said the society has not been allowed to travel west to @entity248 where @entity250 @entity249 are alleged by human rights groups to be suffering systematic abuse amounting to " ethnic cleansing			2
" " they ( the government ) say it 's very dangerous and very difficult			0
so we have no chance to go to the desperate people , " @entity17 said			2
he said the pace of @entity1 's transformation , from a military state to thriving democracy at peace with ethnic rivalries , depends on the attitudes of ordinary people			2
decades of military rule had produced bad attitudes , he said			0
" if the attitudes of normal citizens change and are good -- within five years it will change , " he said			0
" i want to give the message to all people in @entity1 : please be united			2
" @entity275 contributed to this report .			0
