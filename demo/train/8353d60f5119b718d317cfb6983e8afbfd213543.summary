plans to adopt @entity2 civic education into the @entity4 public school curriculum have sparked protests among residents , who claim it amounts to " brainwashing " impressionable young minds with pro-mainland propaganda			1
more than 90,000 people took to the streets on sunday against introducing a " @entity14 " subject , according to protest organizers , while police estimated the turnout at 32,000			1
while the actual content of the curriculum has yet to be determined , guidelines in a booklet distributed by the government 's @entity20 to schools have inflamed the controversy			1
the booklet , entitled " the @entity26 , " includes provocative statements , including that @entity2 's ruling party is " progressive , selfless and united			1
" it also criticized multi-party systems as bringing disaster to countries such as the @entity33			0
the booklet also makes no mention of major events that many view as integral to @entity2 's history , such as the 1989 @entity39 massacre			1
many teachers , parents , and students have interpreted the booklet as a basis for the national education curriculum , which will be introduced in primary schools in september and in secondary schools the following school year			1
" we do n't want the next generation of @entity4 people to be brainwashed , " said @entity48 , 15 , the convener of @entity49 , a group of secondary students that helped organize sunday 's protest along with the @entity52 and the @entity53			1
" it 's impossible to be brainwashed , " said @entity56 , who directs the @entity20			0
" @entity4 people still have access to a lot of information			2
all education is , to some extent , designed to brainwash			0
i think the word ' brainwash ' is too negative			0
it evokes something out of ' @entity67			0
' " " @entity4 's future and @entity2 's future are inseparable , " he added			1
" we will never be independent so we should learn to think the same way as @entity2			2
teachers should lead our children to think about @entity4 's future			1
" @entity48 went on to explain that there will be some flexibility as to how national education will be implemented			0
for example , schools can choose to have specific lessons in the classroom or incorporate " national education " as a broader theme			0
" it 's important to point out the government 's approach actually allows for a lot of autonomy on the part of the schools to teach the curriculum , " said @entity85 , associate professor at the @entity87 's @entity86			2
" so it 's up to the schools to teach what they want to teach with reference to these very general guidelines			2
" " some of the critics want specific topics to be discussed , but the government approach does n't preclude specific topics to be discussed at all , " @entity85 said			0
" i do n't think the government is really going to supervise the specific teaching of this subject , " he added , predicting , " there will be a pluralistic way of teaching the same subject			2
" the controversy followed major protests in the last two months that underscored tensions over the influence of the @entity2 central government in @entity4 's affairs and freedoms			1
the annual vigil held on june 4 to commemorate the 1989 @entity39 massacre drew a record turnout of 180,000 , according to organizers			0
police reported the figure was closer to 85,000			0
by even the most conservative estimates , there were 15,000 more attendees than last year			0
on the july 1 annual protest marking @entity4 's return to @entity2 sovereignty , 400,000 people took to the streets to oppose chief executive leung chun - ying , who was recently appointed by an electoral college of 1,200 influential figures in @entity4 with @entity139 's approval			1
public anger was also inflamed by the suspicious death of @entity39 dissident @entity142 it was the largest turnout since the estimated 500,000 protesters who marked the same date in 2003			0
police put the figure at a much lower 63,000 people			0
" the demonstrations and the concerns about the national education reflect the continuing anxiety of the @entity4 people toward the mainland 's politics and growing influence on @entity4 affairs , " said professor @entity85			1
the uproar over the national education subject is reflective of anxieties being aggravated by the new government under @entity162 , which he said " lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many people			1
" " @entity162 without a doubt reflects a much more @entity170 background			0
if the curriculum was introduced by a more neutral administration , the issue may play out differently			0
" @entity85 said that the introduction of a national education subject should come as no surprise , as the government has publicized its plans for many years			1
the @entity179 launched a four - month public consultation in may 2011 , and government plans to develop a moral and national education subject were included in former chief executive @entity184 's 2010 - 11 annual policy address in october 2010			1
" it 's not a secret -- it begs the questions why some of the protesters and organizers have n't paid attention before , " said @entity85			0
activists have been campaigning on the issue for the past year , and sunday 's protest was a culmination of frustrations over government inaction , said @entity48 from @entity49			2
he said the student group has recruited more than 5,000 volunteers and will continue to press the government to scrap the national education subject			2
if the government does not take action by september 3 , @entity48 said students would boycott classes and teachers would boycott the subject in their classrooms .			2
