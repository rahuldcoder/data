@entity0 -- dr. @entity4 's " severely distressed " financial situation may have led him to " break the rules " in his fatal treatment of @entity7 , a police investigator testified tuesday			1
@entity0 police detective @entity8 testified in the @entity7 wrongful death trial that @entity4 was trying to deal with the large drop in value of his @entity13 home , unpaid taxes and child support payments for eight children with seven women			1
@entity7 's mother and children claim @entity20 is liable for the pop icon 's death because it hired , retained and supervised @entity4 , who worked as his personal physician as he prepared for his comeback concerts in 2009			1
@entity20 says @entity4 was hired and supervised by @entity7 , whom they blame for making bad choices because of his drug addiction			1
one contention in the lawsuit is that the concert promoter should have known that @entity4 's financial stress could lead to unsafe treatments for @entity7			1
@entity20 lawyer : ' @entity34 ' to come @entity8 , the second witness in the trial 's first day of testimony , said that after interviewing @entity4 and after the search of @entity4 's car four days after @entity7 's death , his " thinking at the moment was the crime was negligence			1
" inside the @entity43 -- which belonged to @entity4 's sister in @entity45 -- he found a contract between @entity20 and @entity4 saying he would be paid $ 150,000 a month to work as @entity7 's doctor , along with @entity20 president @entity20 ' business card and cell phone number , he said			1
" that 's a lot of money for anyone , " @entity8 said			2
" seeing the scene and talking to him about what he had done and how he did it raised questions			0
" " focusing on the financial aspect may have been important for dr. @entity4 's willingness to disregard his @entity60 for financial gain , " he testified			1
@entity4 was convicted of involuntary manslaughter and was sentenced to four years in prison			2
prosecutors said @entity7 death was caused by a fatal combination of the surgical anesthetic propofol and sedatives @entity4 gave him in a desperate effort to treat his insomnia			1
@entity8 said what he learned about @entity4 's financial troubles in the weeks after @entity7 's death on june 25 , 2009 , led him " to opine that he may have , for this easy money -- the $ 150,000 a month -- may break the rules , bend the rules , to do whatever he needed to do to get paid			1
" his investigation revealed that @entity4 had n't paid his mortgage in more than six months , his home was being foreclosed on and he had several liens for unpaid child support and tax debts , @entity8 said			1
@entity4 's @entity13 home , which he bought for $ 1.6 million , was appraised at barely $ 1 million in 2009 , he said			1
the @entity13 real estate market had suffered a major decline in home values up to that date			0
@entity92 ' ghost haunts @entity7 death trial judge rules : @entity95 ca n't watch trial without mom the judge ordered that only one of @entity7 's brothers and sisters can come to court to watch the testimony at at a time -- and then only if @entity106 matriarch @entity105 is present			1
@entity20 lawyers argued at the start of the second day of the trial that there was " a risk in allowing any of them in the courtroom			0
" @entity20 expects to call @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 as witnesses in its defense			0
only brother @entity122 is not on the defense witness list			0
@entity20 lawyer @entity124 said in his opening statement monday that @entity106 members will testify about their failed attempts to intervene with @entity7 's drug addiction and their lack of knowledge about what was happening			1
the defense lawyers asked that @entity119 , the only one attending the trial tuesday with his 82 - year - old mother , be booted from court			0
after that , @entity7 lawyer @entity136 told the judge that @entity105 , who can stay in court because she is a plaintiff , needed one of her children to sit with her each day			1
" he can remain , but you can not have five in the courtroom , " @entity143 judge @entity142 said			0
because @entity105 left the courtroom early to avoid gruesome testimony by a paramedic who described @entity7 's death , @entity119 was unable to watch tuesday 's testimony			1
@entity20 and @entity118 attended court monday , the trial 's opening day			2
all of the siblings attended the 2011 criminal trial of @entity4 at various times			2
having members of the famous entertainment family in court could influence the jury because their seats are just a few feet away from the jury box in the small @entity0 courtroom			0
paramedic : @entity7 looked like " a hospice patient " the first witness called tuesday was @entity167 , one of the @entity169 paramedics who responded to the 911 call from @entity7 's home on june 25 , 2009			1
@entity167 mostly repeated the testimony he gave as one of the first witnesses in the @entity4 trial , describing how he initially " thought perhaps this was a hospice patient			2
" " he looked like someone who was at the end stage of a long disease process , " he said			1
" no , no , this just happened , " @entity4 told him , @entity167 said			2
@entity7 was not breathing and appeared to be dead , he said			2
an @entity20 lawyer asked him during cross-examination if he thought @entity4 was not telling him the truth			2
" i do n't even go there , " @entity167 said			0
" i 'm not worried about that			0
" @entity167 's testimony is important to informing the jury about the circumstances of @entity7 's death , but the drama that filled the @entity4 courtroom was not duplicated			1
in fact , humor sometimes emerged			0
@entity136 even asked @entity167 whether he had ever rescued a cat			0
" i have not rescued a cat , " @entity167 , who is also a firefighter , joked			0
" i rescued a dog that was lying in the street			0
" he also shared the ironic story of the next emergency he responded to after leaving @entity7 at the @entity201 's emergency room			2
his ambulance was called to a west @entity0 apartment to help an elderly @entity205 woman , @entity167 said			0
" when she heard the news on tv that @entity7 had died , she fainted , " he said			2
she suffered a minor head injury in her fall			0
" she was just deeply emotional when we took her to the hospital , " @entity167 said			0
