@entity1 , @entity0 -- despite an epic rift in @entity0 - @entity6 relations , @entity0 's top general announced his troops are relying on new unmanned aerial drones recently purchased from @entity6 to battle @entity10 rebels			1
at an international military conference on monday , the commander of @entity0 's armed forces , gen. @entity11 , said that within the last 10 days , his troops had begun employing @entity6 - made " @entity16 " drones on surveillance missions over @entity0 's mountainous eastern border with @entity19			1
@entity11 spoke after a weekend of bloody clashes with @entity10 rebels left at least 12 @entity0 soldiers stationed in this border region dead			1
the fact that @entity0 still depends on @entity6 for high - tech defense technology could complicate the @entity0 government 's threats to punish @entity6 for a botched @entity6 commando raid in which eight @entity0 and a dual - national @entity28 were shot dead aboard a @entity0 ship carrying aid to @entity31			1
@entity6 plans to ease blockade after the may 31 incident , @entity0 's prime minister ominously warned " nothing would ever be the same again , " between the two once - close @entity36 allies			1

@entity0 withdrew its ambassador from @entity45 , @entity6 , in protest and cancelled joint military exercises with @entity6			2
but @entity48 has been careful not to sever ties with the @entity6 defense industry			2
the long - simmering conflict with rebels from the @entity53 ( @entity53 ) has flared once again in recent months , making @entity0 more dependent on @entity6 military technology			1
" this is another paradoxical situation ... @entity0 has been reluctant to freeze defense industry ties with @entity6 , " said @entity56 , a journalist who writes a column on military affairs for the @entity0 newspaper @entity59			2
" you need equipment to fight against asymmetric warfare			0
these are attack helicopters , surveillance systems such as @entity66 's [ @entity66 ] , intelligence systems and satellites ... and @entity0 does n't produce any of these systems			0
" when asked on monday whether @entity6 technicians and engineers had to cut short training on the new drones due to the recent rift in relations , @entity11 insisted @entity0 operators were adequately prepared to pilot the @entity77			1
" now our own personnel , our air force , is using the @entity16 systems that we bought , " @entity11 said			0
" they got the training , it is over			0
we are capable , we have started using them			0
" @entity11 added that the @entity6 - made drones are being sent into @entity19 airspace , in coordination with the @entity89 military , to gather intelligence on @entity53 rebels who have long operated out of remote mountain camps on the @entity19 side of the border			1
according to the @entity0 military , at least 55 of its soldiers have been killed in clashes with @entity53 fighters since the beginning of march			0
over the last week , @entity0 warplanes have carried out several air raids against suspected rebel targets in northern @entity19			0
on march 16 , the @entity0 military said hundreds of @entity0 troops made an incursion several kilometers into @entity19 territory in " hot pursuit " of @entity53 militants .			2
