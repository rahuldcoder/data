@entity0 -- embattled @entity3 commissioner @entity2 apologized friday for what he said was his mishandling of the @entity7 domestic violence scandal but vowed " now i will get it right and will do whatever is necessary to accomplish that			1
" speaking at a @entity12 news conference amid calls for his resignation , @entity2 announced a sweeping policy to counter domestic abuse and sexual assault , mandating all players and staff on the league 's 32 teams undergo education and training about how to prevent abuse			1
the announcement came as critics have questioned why @entity2 had n't taken a tougher stand earlier			1
that would have sent an unequivocal statement about domestic violence in a league that , according to a @entity33 article last week , includes 14 players who have been arrested for violence against women in the past two years			0
others have called for his job			0
but @entity2 , in his first public remarks in more than a week , said he would not step down and was committed to " do the right thing			1
" @entity2 says he wo n't quit " i 'm focused on doing my job , " he told reporters			1
" we have a lot of work to do			0
" the policy is a direct response to a number of high - profile cases , including @entity7 's , that involve @entity3 players			2
even as @entity2 pledged to move ahead and " get it right , " questions loom in the @entity7 case about who knew what when , and who said what to whom			1
two security camera videos put the @entity7 case squarely in the public view , with the one most recently made public showing the former @entity63 ' star knocking out his then - fiancee with a punch inside an elevator last february			1
a source within the @entity63 organization told @entity1 friday that hours after that incident at the @entity71 hotel and casino in @entity73 , the head of @entity63 security , @entity74 , spoke with @entity73 police			1
in that conversation , police described in detail the inside - the - elevator video to @entity74 , the source said			1
@entity81 reported that @entity74 shared the details of that conversation and the description of the video with team executives in @entity63			1
@entity81 also reported team executives -- in particular owner @entity89 , president @entity90 , and @entity92 @entity91 -- began extensive public and private campaigns pushing for leniency for @entity7 on several fronts , from the @entity97 judicial system to @entity2			1
a source in the @entity63 organization told @entity1 that team officials never saw the elevator video until @entity101 released the recording			1
the @entity63 issued this statement late friday : " @entity105 ' article contains numerous errors , inaccuracies , false assumptions and , perhaps , misunderstandings			2
the @entity63 will address all of these next week in @entity63 after our trip to @entity112 for sunday 's game against the @entity114			2
" commissioner : ' i got it wrong ' asked friday about a claim by the @entity97 prosecutor 's office that it has no record of an @entity3 request for information on the case , @entity2 said , " we gather almost entirely all of our information through law enforcement , and that 's something else we 're going to look at ... we asked for it on several occasions			1
according to our security department , we went through it , we asked for it on several occasions			0
" the commissioner also sought to further distance himself from criticism over his handling of the @entity7 matter , saying the account of the incident the player gave the @entity3 was different than what was depicted in a video			1
" i 'm telling you right now it 's inconsistent with what he told us , " @entity2 said , declining to comment further on grounds that @entity7 's indefinite suspension is under appeal by the players union			1
@entity2 @entity2 said the events of recent weeks highlighted much of what is wrong with the league			1
" i got it wrong in the handling of the @entity7 matter and i 'm sorry for that , " he said			1
" i 'm not satisfied with the way we handled it from the get - go			0
i 'm not satisfied with the process we went through			0
i 'm not satisfied with the conclusion			0
" @entity166 , president and ceo of the @entity168 , told @entity1 after @entity2 's remarks that the league made a multimillion dollar commitment to the hotline			2
retired quarterback criticizes @entity3 " he 's admitting that he made a mistake and he 's working to correct it and they 're engaging many voices , " she said of @entity2 and the league			2
but @entity181 quarterback @entity180 on @entity1 friday said he was doubtful of the league 's willingness to deal with domestic violence and other troubles			0
" are we going to allow men to knock out women , abuse women , knock out children and we 're going to have to wait six months to get spin control and get some people in here and buy out some more people ? " he said			0
" i played for 18 years in this league			0
i 've seen coverups in this league just like we see in @entity197 and on @entity198			0
" @entity2 , once viewed as a no - holds - barred enforcer who was called in to clean house , levied a mere two - game suspension against @entity7 , based on an initial video from outside the elevator that only showed @entity7 dragging @entity205 out			1
later , the new footage that showed the punch prompted @entity2 to suspend the veteran player indefinitely			2
last week , amid mounting criticism , the league announced that former fbi director @entity211 will lead an independent inquiry into the league 's investigation and how it gathered evidence in the case			0
now : @entity211 appointment ' window dressing ' @entity2 on friday dismissed questions about whether @entity211 's involvement with a law firm that has dealings with the league compromised the former @entity226 director 's investigation			2
the @entity227 called @entity211 's appointment " just window dressing , " saying it did n't go far enough , and repeated its call for @entity2 to resign			2
it 's been a tumultuous week for the man at the helm of the @entity3			0
with @entity7 suspended indefinitely , the league saw three more of its players come under scrutiny over domestic violence or child abuse allegations			2
two of those players were deactivated for their sunday games			0
@entity242 of the @entity243 was deactivated after an @entity245 grand jury indicted him on a child abuse charge			0
@entity242 's lawyer has said his client is innocent , and the @entity243 ' owners announced that @entity242 will return to practice this week and is scheduled to play sunday			0
" while i am disappointed in what @entity242 was involved with , we want to see the facts , " @entity2 told reporters on friday			0
" what we have to do is allow those facts to succeed			0
" @entity1 's @entity256 , @entity257 and @entity258 contributed to this story .			0
