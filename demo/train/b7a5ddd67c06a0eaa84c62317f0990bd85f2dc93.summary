-- listen carefully at the corner of @entity3 streets in uptown @entity4 , and you 'll hear the sounds that make the @entity4 one of the country 's best - kept secrets			1
the laughter of old men playing chess in a courtyard			0
the music from @entity15 after five , a weekly summer outdoor concert series that draws hundreds of young professionals looking to loosen their ties and unwind after work			2
the roar of the fans at @entity22 , where @entity24 quarterback sensation @entity23 has just breathed life into a good - as - dead team			2
@entity27 : share photos and tips for @entity4 the drone of the ever - present street sweeper , keeping the city as sparkling as its skyscrapers			1
the soft breeze rustling the blooming trees of spring			0
the silence on a hot summer day when most @entity39 flee the city for the cooling relief of @entity42 , just 20 minutes north			2
i last stood at that intersection in the center of the city more than two years ago , right before i moved to @entity47			2
i thought foolishly then that i needed a bigger city			2
the truth is , i 've never missed @entity4 more			1
@entity27 : share photos and tips for @entity52 the people i grew up in @entity54 , which -- if you 're from the @entity57 area -- you know is not really the @entity60 , despite its geographical location below the @entity63			1
@entity64 , i am not			0
i take my tea unsweet , still have n't acquired a taste for collards and find it physically impossible for my mouth to form the word " y'all			0
" so why did i fall in love with @entity4 , @entity72 ? a former colleague of mine at the @entity75 once wrote that the best icebreaker question in @entity4 is , " where are you from ? " the region , with 1.8 million residents , is teeming with newcomers , making it a melting pot of accents and cultures			1
city smackdown : @entity85 vs. @entity86 in my group of friends , we hailed from @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity85 , @entity92 and @entity93			0
out of all of us , only one was part of the increasingly endangered species known as native @entity39			0
a big part of the draw is @entity4 's banking institutions			1
the city is home to @entity102 , and @entity105 's @entity104 offices are headquartered there			2
but the mild year - round weather and its proximity to the beach and the mountains -- @entity110 's just three hours away and @entity111 a mere two -- are what entice people to lay down roots			1
@entity115 : @entity116 beyond the beaches the food the diversity of @entity4 's residents makes for an equally eclectic restaurant scene			1
my favorite @entity123 restaurant to date is copper , in the streetcar suburb of @entity127			0
when i crave a burger , i immediately think of @entity130 's @entity129			0
on a cold winter night , nothing warms you up like the chicken and dumplings at @entity135 in the funky neighborhood of @entity137 , where tattooed and pierced waiters serve up comfort food with a side of sass			0
have a sweet tooth ? my mouth still waters at the thought of the salted caramel brownies at @entity147 's @entity146 in the @entity148 ( @entity149			0
@entity152 , the @entity151 - style bakery is typically filled with local entrepreneurs and college students sipping coffee and munching on pastries over their laptops			0
i could begin a debate about how @entity160 - style barbecue is superior to all others , but that 's another column			2
instead , if you 're in @entity4 , get a pork barbecue plate at @entity164 's , a local institution in south @entity4 since 1963			1
when its namesake owner died in 2007 , it prompted an outpouring of condolences from the community			0
@entity172 's grandson still operates the restaurant , keeping up @entity164 's legacy of good ' cue and better service			0
and finally , no visit to @entity4 is complete without stopping at @entity178 's @entity177 for the best fried chicken you will ever eat			1
walk across the street and grab a spot on the grass to savor the crispy decadence : there is no seating inside , and lines form long before the noon lunch hour			0
at your first bite , you 'll realize why actor - singer @entity191 said recently that the thing he misses most about filming " @entity193 " in @entity4 is @entity178 's chicken			1
@entity160 lures ' @entity193 ' fans the lifestyle i lived in @entity4 for five years , two of which were spent covering the city 's nightlife and entertainment scene for the newspaper			1
as part of my job , i attended concerts , took in touring @entity206 plays , sipped cocktails at almost every local watering hole , partied with @entity210 drivers and @entity24 players , and rubbed elbows with the city 's leaders at high - end charity events			1
since i 've left , the number of attractions has grown even further , with the opening of the @entity219 and a four - venue arts complex comprised of three museums and an intimate theater			0
the @entity223 takes up an entire uptown block , and each building is more visually stunning than the last			0
but the things i miss the most are running into friends at @entity228 and trader @entity229 , being on a first - name basis with local business owners and being within an easy 15 - minute drive of almost everything			0
this is the @entity60 : small - town charm and southern hospitality are ever - present , but in a bustling , modern city with a lively arts and entertainment scene			1
come september , @entity4 will be on the world 's stage as an estimated 35,000 people , hundreds of news media and president @entity245 descend on the city for the @entity247			1
it will easily be the biggest event to ever happen in @entity4 , whose local leaders have been consistently billing it as a world - class city worthy of such events			1
if you 're one of those attending the convention , you might find the intersection of @entity3 and @entity258 too busy to stop and take it all in			0
@entity4 , let this former resident be the first to congratulate you			2
@entity52 or @entity4 ? cast your vote above and share photos and support for your city on @entity27 .			1

@entity278 says @entity4 *combines* big - city amenities and small - town charm
