-- the second edition of an online @entity3 magazine has surfaced with frank essays , creatively designed imagery and ominous terror tips such as using a pickup truck as a weapon and shooting up a crowded restaurant in @entity10			1
the magazine is called " @entity17 " and intelligence officials believe that an @entity14 citizen named @entity15 , now living in @entity16 , is the driving force behind the publication			1
the latest edition was emerged on the 10th anniversary of the suicide attack on the guided missile destroyer @entity24 -- struck as it refueled in @entity26 , @entity16			1
the first edition came out in july			0
@entity28 , a @entity16 expert with the @entity29 , said the timing is no coincidence			1
" it also comes on the heels of a busy week for @entity3 in @entity16			1
they released an hourlong video last week			0
there was also an attack on a @entity38 in @entity39 [ @entity16 's capital ] last week			1
and an audiotape was released two days ago			0
@entity3 in @entity16 is good at amplifying its message and that shows the organization is still active , that they 're still able to function , " he said			1
an article titled " @entity46 " calls for using a pickup truck as a " mowing machine , not to mow grass but mow down the enemies of @entity51			2
" the article says that such a plan could be implemented in countries where people back the " @entity57 occupation of @entity58 , the @entity14 invasion of @entity60 and @entity61 or countries that had a prominent role in the defamation of @entity65			0
" it said a four - wheel - drive pickup truck is needed -- " the stronger the better			2
" " to achieve maximum carnage , you need to pick up as much speed as you can while still retaining good control of your vehicle in order to maximize your inertia and be able to strike as many people as possible in your first run , " the article says			0
another tip in the magazine includes the use of firearms			2
" for this choose the best location			0
a random hit at a crowded restaurant in @entity10 at lunch hour , for example , might end up knocking out a few government employees			1
" targeting such employees is paramount and the location would also give the operation additional media attention			1
" an idea in the first edition , " make a bomb in the @entity93 , " is touched on again			0
" the pressurized cooker should be placed in crowded areas and left to blow up			0
more than one of these could be planted to explode at the same time			0
however , keep in mind that the range of the shrapnel in this operation is short range so the pressurized cooker or pipe should be placed close to the intended targets and should not be concealed from them by barriers such as walls			0
" @entity110 , senior analyst at @entity111 , said the " very well - presented magazine " covers a variety of topics , is meant to reach a wider audience , and tries to be tongue - in - cheek in its presentation			2
" the magazine has suggestions , ideology it attempts to instill in the reader , and it includes tips for technology , " @entity110 said			1
@entity28 said the " big takeaway " is that the magazine is focusing on what the individual can do			1
" the message to the lone actor is to be patient -- that you can do it -- you can participate in this , " he said			2
there are writings in the magazine by @entity16 - @entity14 cleric @entity137 , who @entity14 authorities have linked to the failed attempt to blow up a @entity14 - bound jetliner in december			1
@entity15 wrote an article titled " i am proud to be a traitor to @entity14			0
" there is also recycled material			0
the latest issue includes recent commentary from @entity147 , who is an @entity14 , about president @entity148			2
