-- all eyes are on @entity2 this summer			1
the @entity3 begin next month ; earlier this month , the @entity4 provided glorious pictures and joyous sounds to the watching world			1
the history and beauty of the great city are being much discussed , and with good reason			2
@entity2 is a bedrock of civilized society , a touchstone for commerce , culture and statecraft down through the centuries			2
but while all the grand moments in @entity2 's , and @entity21 's , history are being revisited this summer , there is one rather important event that is likely to be ignored			1
its 70th anniversary is this week			2
and anyone who loves @entity2 , or who loves freedom , might want to contemplate it			2
seventy years ago -- in the last week of june in 1942 -- an @entity30 from @entity32 farm country arrived in besieged @entity2			1
prince @entity33 : 30 years in photos it was a business trip , of sorts			2
the man 's bosses had assigned him a daunting task			2
summed up in a few words , that task was : save the world			2
@entity21 , and free @entity42 , were under terrible peril at the hands of @entity46 's @entity45			1
the @entity48 people and the @entity48 military had shown extraordinary valor , but it was not going to be enough			2
and so , on that day in late june , @entity54 of @entity55 , @entity53 arrived in @entity2 with the new title of commanding general of the @entity58			1
@entity59 did n't realize it at the time , but @entity54 's arrival in @entity2 meant that he was through			1
it had been a year of loss and mourning for @entity54			1
little over three months before , his father , who among other jobs had worked at an @entity55 creamery , had died			0
@entity54 could not leave his post in @entity69 as deputy to @entity71 chief of staff gen. @entity72 even to return to @entity53 to attend his dad 's funeral			1
video : a look back at @entity54 's legacy but for 30 minutes on that day , he closed the door of his office and wrote , in longhand , in his diary : " my father was buried today			1
... he was a just man , well liked , a thinker			0
he was undemonstrative , quiet , modest , and of exemplary habits -- he never used alcohol or tobacco			0
... his finest monument is his reputation in @entity55 and @entity91			0
... his word has been his bond and accepted as such			0
... i 'm proud he was my father			0
my only regret is that it was always so difficult to let him know the great depth of my affection for him			0
" later that evening , @entity54 realized he had not committed the extent of his grief to paper			1
he wrote in the diary : " i have felt terribly			0
i should like so much to be with my mother these few days			0
but we 're at war			0
and war is not soft -- it has no time to indulge even the deepest and most sacred emotions			0
... quitting work now -- 7:30 p.m. i have n't the heart to go on tonight			0
" but by june , he did go on , with the assignment of commanding all the @entity115 in @entity42			1
the invasion of @entity117 would soon follow			0
then , having been promoted to supreme commander of the @entity119 , @entity54 would direct the largest combined sea , air and land military undertaking in the history of the world : @entity125 , the d - day invasion of @entity45 - occupied @entity42			1
feature : @entity48 monarchy 's long - lasting love affair with the sea @entity21 , and @entity42 , and the free world would survive and prevail			1
all was not easy ; every decision was not without its critics , both at the time and in the ensuing years			0
some strategies did not work out the way he had hoped and planned for			0
@entity54 himself realized this , and was at peace with it			1
after the war , remembering his arrival in @entity2 , he would write : " @entity145 , as so many men have said , is the most stupid and tragic of human ventures			0
it is stupid because so few problems are enduringly solved ; tragic because its cost in lives and spirit and treasure is seldom matched in the fruits of victory			2
still , i never intend to join myself with those who damn all wars as vile crimes against humanity			0
@entity145 , not sought by the people of the @entity30 or its allies , was certainly not , on their part , either stupid or in vain			2
satisfaction , and memories precious beyond price , rewarded those who survived and who , in loyalty to country and to ideals , answered the attack			0
" in that summer of 1942 , @entity21 's princess @entity175 was 16 years old			1
eleven years later , in 1953 , coronation ceremonies would officially bestow upon her the crown of the queen			0
also in 1953 , inaugural ceremonies in @entity69 would officially swear in @entity54 as president of the @entity30			1
@entity182 coverage : how @entity33 , @entity183 and @entity184 made royals cool @entity2 will glitter on the world stage this summer			2
the famous phrase will be heard often : " there 'll always be an @entity21			1
" but that was not so certain , 70 years ago			0
during the royal jubilee this month , the moving anthem beloved by the @entity48 people was played and sung many times : " @entity194			1
" in the @entity30 , we do n't have royalty			0
but on occasion , we have majesty			0
and in this @entity2 summer -- a summer in a great city , free and proud -- perhaps there will be a few people who will pause if only for a moment to recall what once transpired , and who will close their eyes and offer the silent thought : may @entity207 bless the memory of @entity54			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			1

@entity211 : all eyes on @entity21 for jubilee , *upcoming* @entity3 , but recall another anniversary
june 1942 , @entity54 took command in @entity42 ; it would soon be the end for @entity59
@entity211 says @entity54 made *personal* sacrifices for service , went on to help allies to victory
@entity211 : as " @entity194 " rings out this month , take moment to bless @entity54 , too
