@entity0 -- as they furiously typed computer code through the night in a small @entity5 office , little did they know they were about to change the way @entity2 would view what has become known as the worst offshore oil spill in @entity2 history			1
the handful of staffers from rep. @entity13 's now defunct @entity12 and @entity14 had just received word from oil giant @entity16 that they would be given a live feed of the underwater cameras monitoring the spewing oil from 8,000 feet below the @entity20			1
the date was may 19 , 2010 , nearly one month to the day that the @entity22 well had exploded , killing 11 workers and causing oil to stream unabated into the @entity20			1
" this was like a tornado but under the water , which people could not see , " @entity13 , @entity25 , told @entity1 this week			2
up to that point , @entity16 had only released short snippets of video from the robotic cameras			2
@entity13 and other congressional democrats had been pressuring @entity16 to allow them to see the live pictures			1
photos : @entity20 oil disaster a year later as @entity13 's staff worked to post the live feed on their website , they debated what to call it			1
finally it was decided that " spillcam " was the most descriptive			0
by 9 a.m. the next day , the video feed went up on the committee website			0
within 24 hours a million people had seen it			0
the demand was so high , it not only crashed the committee 's website but the huge volume also temporarily crashed the @entity57 's web system			0
" @entity59 " was a game - changer			2
" once they saw it , once they could understand the damage that it was doing to the environment and to the livelihoods of the people in the @entity20 , that 's when the spillcam became something that changed the whole course of the way in which the government and @entity16 was responding to this disaster , " @entity13 says			1
the video eventually was viewed by many more millions around the world as @entity1 and other networks broadcast the images			0
estimates of just how much oil was gushing into the @entity20 ballooned			1
initially @entity16 and the government announced 1,000 barrels a day was leaking into the @entity20 from the well			1
those estimates continued to climb from 5,000 barrels a day to 12,000 to 19,000 and eventually up to 60,000 barrels a day			0
@entity59 allowed teams of government scientists to calculate better estimates			1
@entity20 oil disaster still puzzles scientists but one year after the @entity89 well explosion , @entity13 , who became the face of @entity92 trying to hold @entity16 accountable , says nothing has changed			1
" @entity92 has not passed any legislation yet to respond to the lessons which we have learned from that spill , " he says			1
@entity13 blames @entity99 senators and the @entity101 rules requiring 60 votes to pass legislation to strengthen safety rules regulating offshore drilling			2
but , when pressed , he concedes that some of his @entity108 colleagues in the @entity101 joined the majority of @entity99 to defeat the @entity57 bill in the last @entity92			2
the oil industry itself and the @entity113 have taken the lead in putting new safety and preparedness measures into place since the explosion			0
the much - maligned @entity119 , previously under investigation for being too cozy with the oil industry it regulates , was shaken up in the wake of the spill			2
now the newly named @entity124 has split its regulatory divisions so the people who monitor safety and leasing for oil drilling are not the same division that collects royalties			0
the government has also implemented new , tougher standards for well design			0
in addition , oil companies must now certify to the government that they can respond to a spill			1
some of the technology developed in trying to cap the @entity16 spill is now part of some of those certification plans			1
rig survivors ' wives , kids also victims but @entity13 , whose party is now in the minority in the @entity57 , lost another battle in february			2
that is when the @entity152 administration once again decided to allow deepwater drilling with the support of @entity99 and some @entity20 - state @entity108 who argued that drilling means jobs			0
@entity13 thinks the administration might have moved too quickly			0
" i am saying that they have to be very careful			0
it ( deepwater drilling ) should only be limited , it should only be out to certain depths , and it should only be with a guarantee that they can go out and to cap it as quickly as possible			0
" he says he still has real concerns about safety			0
" the reality is that there are still inherent problems with blowout preventers , that an accident can still occur and that we have n't been able to pass all of the safety legislation necessary that would serve as a deterrent to a repetition of what happened last year			0
" stories from the @entity20 , one year on this month , @entity13 's @entity99 colleagues passed three new bills out of committee that would allow oil companies to get permits faster to drill offshore , open new areas of the @entity2 to offshore drilling and increase offshore drilling in the @entity20			1
with gas prices approaching $ 4 a gallon , republicans say these bills strike a balance between safety and the demand for oil			0
@entity13 says they 're acting as if the spill never happened .			1

@entity59 changed the way @entity16 , government responded to @entity20 oil disaster
underwater camera allowed scientists to better understand the gusher
rep. @entity13 says a year later , @entity92 has taken no action to prevent another spill
