the contention that president @entity1 apologized to other nations for @entity4 behavior has been mentioned repeatedly by his critics , including @entity6			1
during his acceptance speech at the @entity8 in august , @entity6 said , " i will begin my presidency with the jobs tour			0
president @entity1 began his with an apology tour			1
@entity12 , he said , had dictated to other nations			2
no , mr. president @entity12 has freed other nations from dictators			2
" at last week 's debate that " president @entity1 's policies throughout the @entity18 began with an apology tour			1
" @entity6 made the claim again during the monday night debate			0
" the president began what i have called an apology tour , of going to various nations in the @entity18 and criticizing @entity12			1
" @entity27 @entity28 : @entity1 's @entity30 tire case @entity6 also said the " reason i call it an apology tour is because you went to the @entity18 and you flew to @entity35 and to @entity36 and to @entity37 and @entity38			1
and by the way , you skipped @entity40 , our closest friend in the region , but you went to the other nations			0
" @entity6 said " in those nations , and on @entity46 , you said that @entity12 had been dismissive and derisive			2
you said that on occasion @entity12 had dictated to other nations			2
" @entity1 said the apologizing claim " has been probably the biggest whopper that 's been told during the course of this campaign			1
" the facts : when president @entity1 began his term , he made a number of speeches in the @entity18 and elsewhere -- all designed to forge better ties with @entity59 , the @entity18 , and @entity12			1
critics such as @entity6 have said @entity1 apologized for past actions in such addresses			1
@entity1 did indeed mention past @entity4 flaws in speeches			1
but in those addresses , @entity1 never uttered an apology for the @entity4			1
those statements were snippets , part of larger and grander narratives about repairing ties , building friendship and working together			0
fact check : @entity6 , @entity1 and @entity38 during an address in @entity73 , @entity74 , in april 2009 , @entity1 did utter words @entity6 referenced in the debate			2
in that speech , @entity1 said , " there have been times where @entity12 has shown arrogance and been dismissive , even derisive			1
" but in the very next sentence , @entity1 called out the @entity59 for an " anti-americanism that is at once casual but can also be insidious			2
instead of recognizing the good that @entity12 so often does in the world , there have been times where @entity59 choose to blame @entity12 for much of what 's bad			1
" he then goes on to talk about forging " common solutions to our common problems			0
" " @entity12 can not confront the challenges of this century alone , but that @entity59 can not confront them without @entity12			2
so i 've come to @entity59 this week to renew our partnership , one in which @entity12 listens and learns from our friends and allies , but where our friends and allies bear their share of the burden			2
together , we must forge common solutions to our common problems			0
" an april 2009 speech before the @entity37 parliament praised both the @entity4 and @entity37			1
it focused on common bonds and threats , such as extremism , the economy , and energy issues			0
during that speech , he said " another issue that confronts all democracies as they move to the future is how we deal with the past " and touches on a major blemish on @entity4 history			1
" the @entity4 is still working through some of our own darker periods in our history , " @entity1 said			1
" our country still struggles with the legacies of slavery and segregation , the past treatment of @entity126			0
" after that statement , @entity1 segued into a similar stain on @entity37 's history -- the massacre of @entity131 during @entity132 , and how both @entity37 and @entity131 should work toward a " new day			2
" fact check : @entity135 core decimated or growing ? in june 2009 , @entity1 delivered a major speech in @entity35 where he discussed " a new beginning between the @entity4 and @entity138 around the world , one based on mutual interest and mutual respect			1
" citing the " fear and anger " after 9/11 , @entity1 said that in some cases , " it led us to act contrary to our traditions and our ideals			0
" while defending @entity12 's reaction to the 9/11 attacks , @entity1 resolved to fight extremism , support @entity40 , and back the establishment of a @entity154 state			1
. back in december , @entity155 , a columnist for @entity157 's @entity156 , called the " apology tour " claim " a lie that has been reiterated so often that it has become conventional wisdom on the right			0
" " the apology canard has been disproven practically as often as it has been made			0
" as for @entity40 , it is true that the president has n't visited the country since his election			0
but @entity1 did visit the jewish state during his 2008 campaign			0
he went to the @entity171 and the southern @entity40 town of @entity173 , the city battered by missiles from @entity176 - controlled @entity175			0
" if we 're going to talk about trips that we 've taken -- when i was a candidate for office , first trip i took was to visit our troops , " @entity1 said			0
he had visited @entity38 and @entity183 as a candidate			0
fact check : comparing costs of @entity38 , @entity188 missions conclusion : @entity6 's claim is false			0
the president has mentioned past @entity4 mistakes and flaws during speeches about the larger issues of building bridges to other countries			1
but he has never apologized or gone on an " apology tour			0
" complete coverage of @entity27 's @entity199			0
