immigration champion rep. @entity0 feels confident that president @entity2 will use his executive powers to push through reform			1
house speaker @entity5 feels confident that doing so will tank what little support the president has among @entity10 on immigration reform			1
they 're both right , immigration law experts say			2
after pushback from immigration activists and some members of his party , the president has directed his administration to reexamine its deportation policy			1
the administration could shift noncriminals and minor offenders to the lowest deportation priorities			0
" i think the president has a difficult decision to make here , " said @entity24 , a professor at @entity25			0
" the courts have upheld wide discretion on immigration matters			0
he could make noncriminals the lowest deportation priorities			0
... but there is a penalty he could pay through using executive action rather than waiting for @entity37 to act on immigration reform			1
" that political price , @entity5 told @entity40 last week , is " that will make it almost impossible to ever do immigration reform , because he will spoil the well to the point where no one will trust him by giving him a new law that he will implement the way the @entity37 intended			1
" " the @entity52 people want us to deal with immigration reform , " @entity5 said on @entity40 ' " @entity49 " during the same interview			1
" but every time the president ignores the law , like the 38 times he has on @entity58 , our members look up and go , ' wait a minute : you ca n't have immigration reform without strong border security and internal enforcement			1
how can we trust the president to actually obey the law and enforce the law that we would write ? ' " legislation stuck in the @entity68 last year , the @entity69 passed a comprehensive immigration reform package -- which includes a citizenship path for an estimated 8 million of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country , according to the @entity74			1
roughly one - third of that chamber 's @entity10 supported the measure , but the legislation has been stymied in the @entity10 - controlled @entity68 as lawmakers there hammer out more incremental approaches to such things as a path to legalization			1
dems to @entity2 : suspend deportations in the meantime , @entity2 has faced increasing pressure from immigration activists and members of his own party to use the power of his pen to help stem the high number of deportations that have occurred during his administration			1
under this president , there have been roughly 2 million deportations , a number that far exceeds that of previous administrations and led the head of the @entity104 to dub him " the deporter - in - chief			2
" there are things @entity2 could do right away , experts say			2
currently , law enforcement agents along the border and those investigating national security matters can engage in ethnic or racial profiling			0
federal agents elsewhere in the country can profile based on a person 's religion , national origin , sexual orientation or gender identification if they suspect immigration or national security laws have been broken			0
@entity2 could , through executive action , expand a ban on any kind of profiling , according to a report released tuesday by the @entity128 at @entity130 's @entity129 , which would reduce the amount of people taken into custody and reduce deportations			1
" this is something the president has known he could do since the beginning of his administration , " said @entity135 , co-director of the @entity128 's @entity137 and @entity136			0
" and i do think the renewed commitment to doing executive action should help push things forward			1
" the @entity144 is reviewing racial profiling in federal law enforcement , and the @entity68 recently directed the @entity144 to include @entity147 in its review			0
why has n't @entity2 acted on immigration ? the president 's apparent reluctance to use the power of his office to more heavily push immigration reform is a bit baffling , immigration and political analysts say			1
" it 's a mystery , " said @entity158 senior political analyst @entity157			0
" he clearly cares , but he has n't fought the issue			0
public opinion is still malleable on this			0
... this is an opportunity for the president to get back into this fight and embrace the @entity175 spirit , " @entity157 said of the former @entity165 governor 's " compassionate conservative " approach to immigration , which includes understanding the impact of deportation on families			2
@entity2 said in november that he does not have the power to halt the record number of deportations that have occurred under his watch			1
but he does have some latitude in implementing such laws , immigration law experts say			0
using prosecutorial discretion , the executive branch has the " inherent power to choose which cases to act on , " @entity183 , an immigration law professor at the @entity185 's @entity184 , told @entity158			2
@entity2 said he ca n't stop deportations of immigrants , but maybe he can some prominent @entity192 agree and point to his executive action in 2012 in halting the deportations of " dreamers , " the children of undocumented immigrants dubbed for the @entity199 , which would have provided amnesty for them			1
" mr. president , you do have the power to stop what 's going on , " rep. @entity201 , @entity203 - @entity202 , said at a news conference in december calling for an end to the deportations			2
@entity201 and @entity0 were among the 30 @entity192 lawmakers who signed a letter telling the president that not only did he have the authority to halt the high number of deportations , but " our efforts in @entity37 will only be helped by the sensible and moral step of stopping deportations			1
" @entity2 netted 71 % of the @entity221 vote in the last election , while @entity10 nominee @entity223 garnered 27 %			1
@entity221 are the fastest - growing minority group			0
@entity10 wants to expand appeal beyond its base after the @entity10 's losses among african - americans , women and @entity231 , the party performed an autopsy of sorts and has since redoubled efforts to make better inroads with those groups			2
@entity238 @entity237 last week said race was part of the reason @entity10 in that chamber are blocking immigration reform efforts			1
" i think race has something to do with the fact that they 're not bringing up an immigration bill , " she said			0
however , despite the popularity the president enjoyed among @entity221 , a minority group that has been vocal about the record - high deportations , using executive action to do more on immigration reform could have negative political consequences , said @entity257 , the @entity25 professor			1
" in the short term for @entity2 himself , it might not matter , but what 's sauce for the goose is sauce for the gander , " @entity24 said			2
" if a @entity10 president made an executive action and used @entity2 as an example to say ' i could do what i want , ' it could hurt @entity192			1
" still , strong signals from the @entity68 recently in directing @entity147 to look into how it can apply immigration laws " more humanely " give members of the @entity276 and their constituents hope			0
@entity0 took to the @entity68 floor recently to warn republicans that when it comes to immigration , a day of reckoning is coming			2
" if you refuse to give the president a bill he can sign because you do not trust him to enforce immigration laws ... he will act without you , " @entity0 , a @entity283 who hails from the president 's home state of @entity286 , said on the @entity68 floor this month			2
" he has alternatives under existing law			0
there are concrete ways within existing law to help keep families together and spare @entity52 citizens from losing their wives , their husbands and their children to deportation			0
in spite of your lack of action , " @entity0 said			0
" and i believe the president is going to use those tools			0
i saw it in his eyes when i met with him			0

activists , some *democrats* want @entity2 to use executive action to stem deportations
@entity10 warn that using the pen will risk broader immigration reform efforts
@entity318 and political analysts say @entity2 could do more but must tread carefully
some @entity192 lawmakers , immigration activists expect the president to act soon
