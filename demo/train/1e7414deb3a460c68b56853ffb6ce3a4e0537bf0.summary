-- @entity1 , the former drummer for the @entity3 - fronted band @entity2 , is starring in the upcoming documentary " @entity5			1
" the film examines @entity1 's roots , her rise to fame with @entity2 and her drug addiction			1
@entity1 spoke to @entity0 about " @entity5 , " her relationship with @entity3 and @entity11 , and her thoughts on women in the music industry today			1
@entity0 : " @entity5 " highlights the time in your life when you were a member of @entity2 during the peak period of the grunge rock era			1
have you been in touch with your former band mates since you left @entity2 in 1998 ? were you in contact with them during the course of filming ? @entity1 : i kept in contact with @entity3 ( @entity3 ) over the years , i knew where she was at with that			1
seeing the first edit of the documentary and how ( @entity2 band mates ) explained that time was pretty much the first time i got to know what their feelings were			1
brought us all back together in a way			1
just me reaching out to say " thank you " for doing the interview and to sort of talk about that			1
and then we all met together at the @entity45 film festival at @entity46 ( @entity47 's @entity46 ) last year			2
first time we were all together			2
so much around at that time because i had not been in the same room together with them since i walked out of the studio ( 13 years ago , recording the " celebrity skin " album )			2
nothing had changed in terms of waiting for @entity3 , and that was the situation that night			1
good to see everyone , good to stand together			2
@entity57 ( @entity58 ) and @entity3 gifted us with the publishing of the music for the documentary ; we could not have made it without that music			1
@entity0 : how would you describe your relationship with @entity3 and the other band members ? @entity1 : we were still distant			1
i was not really in touch with everyone			2
in the process of the film , when we started shooting , i was still unsure as to whether i wanted to do the film			2
and then over time , things started to change			2
the more recovery i got , the less those sort of resentments were intense			2
things started to dissolve towards everyone			2
[ @entity3 's ] always been honest -- she was the one in the situation with " celebrity skin " and me being replaced with the studio guy			1
she was the one who did not surprise me -- she is honest about everything			2
and @entity57 and @entity82 were the ones where i was like , " what ? " i know her , and she is who she is , and i accept her exactly the way she is			2
with @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , i have always enjoyed playing music with him and @entity82 ( @entity88 ) as well			2
at the time they talk about their feelings about what happened -- and @entity82 said she was concerned about her bass parts and what she was going to do			2
we became this business that was swallowed by the machine			0
what we started out as is so different from what we became			0
we were feminists , we had these things to say , then it became the opposite result			0
in my mind , i felt a bit of @entity105 © in going along with it -- we 're going there , we 're doing it			0
@entity0 : what was it like to be in a band with @entity3 , someone who @entity113 described as " the most controversial woman in rock history " ? @entity1 : she is extremely smart and also angry and had her demons			1
she pretty much released it all on stage , and a lot of people related to that , and kids related to that , and women related to that			0
i wish i could tell everyone to " f " off like she does			0
that 's what she meant to a lot of people			0
also , this sort of fearlessness			0
@entity0 : everyone thinks of @entity3 when they think of @entity2			1
but your peers say you were really the force behind the band			1
did you even know that at the time ? @entity1 : @entity142 , i had my own thing going , my own demons to exorcise -- a girl , a drummer , all these things from my youth			1
i 'm gay -- there was anger during that time for me			0
i made my way to punk rock -- i found that there are other freaks and weirdos like me			0
i wanted to prove myself as a drummer and as a female musician to my band and to the rest of the world			1
@entity0 : you had a very close relationship with @entity11 , and the film features some personal scenes between you and him			0
what is the most important thing you would want people to know about him after all this time ? @entity1 : in outing that footage , it was a lot			1
he and i were friends before i joined @entity2			0
he was a special person			0
he introduced me to @entity3 to play in @entity2			1
in the footage , he was the guy who loves his baby and his wife			0
and that 's what i wanted to show -- just that			0
@entity0 : what do you want people to learn from " @entity5 " ? @entity1 : with the film , i like the dialogue it starts about addiction			1
there 's always a good dialogue with the audience about addiction -- what it is , and , is that why i started using drugs , because i was in @entity2 ? i have something inside my dna that makes me choose drugs as a solution instead of anything else			0
also , the fact that it does get better , to quote that phrase			0
i found my way being a gay woman and eventually got married and had a baby			0
i feel so grateful to play music for a living , but eventually found more about me than just doing that			0
i 'm not just a drummer , i am a lot more than that			1
@entity0 : what are your thoughts on women in music , especially in the rock genres , today ? who do you look up to ? and who do you think are the " ones to watch " ? @entity1 : i really like " @entity221 " as songwriters			1
what they do is great			0
their music is amazing , and they write their songs			0
@entity230 , she is an amazing singer and songwriter			0
there 's a band called , @entity233			1
those are my favorites right now			0
@entity0 : what are some of your favorite bands ? and what are the top albums that rock your world ? @entity1 : " @entity244 " was a huge one , and " @entity243 " is another great one			1
the soundtrack of my life during the ' 90s is @entity249 's " @entity248			1
@entity253 ' " revolver " -- huge			0
" @entity254 " -- so important			0
@entity0 : what is a unique or surprising fact that most people do not know about you ? @entity1 : i enjoy napping a lot -- naps are important			1
i just got excited about reading , and i 'm 44			0
i love reading ( laughs ) .			0
