-- @entity1 is controversial enough in this country			0
many commentators criticize the cost of her clothes and the glitz of her entertaining			0
yet it may be that she has generated the most reaction across the @entity10			0
as you may have heard , @entity12 president @entity11 has entangled himself in a farcical emotional comedy			1
on january 10 , a @entity12 magazine printed an article insinuating that @entity11 had fallen in love with an actress , @entity18			1
@entity11 threatened to sue for invasion of privacy , but he did not deny the truth of the story			1
almost immediately after the magazine story appeared , @entity11 's present partner -- a former television presenter named @entity24 -- had checked herself into a hospital			1
friends told the press that @entity24 had swallowed " a pill too many			0
" what has @entity1 to do with all this ? the president of @entity12 is set to visit the @entity33 on february 11			1
the grand question convulsing the @entity12 media is : who will @entity11 present to @entity1 as the first lady of @entity12 ? the @entity39 newspaper , the @entity38 , reports that @entity24 " has told friends that she will forgive [ @entity11 ] if she stays as first lady and the other woman goes			1
" @entity24 has supposedly set the @entity45 visit and the meeting with @entity1 as the crucial decision point			2
at a lengthy press conference on january 14 , @entity11 promised that the question , " does @entity12 have a first lady , and if so , who ? " would be resolved out before the @entity45 visit			1
the @entity12 are unused to romantic dramas played out in public			1
until recently , the wife of a @entity12 president was deemed a private person , not a representative of the state			1
mme @entity60 , mme @entity62 , mme @entity64 , mme @entity66 and mme @entity68 would appear at formal state functions but otherwise remain secluded from public view			0
( @entity66 , president from 1981 through 1995 , insisted especially forcefully on privacy for his family for a reason the @entity12 public only learned after his death : he had two families and maintained both of the households at public expense			1
all that changed , first under @entity82 , elected in 2007 , and now @entity11 , elected in 2012			1
the twice - divorced @entity82 married the glamorous @entity83 a year into his term of office			0
the next year , @entity82 became the first @entity12 president to have a child in office			1
it was @entity82 and @entity83 who reinvented the role of the @entity12 first lady -- and @entity1 seems to have been a big part of the reason why			1
in 2008 , the @entity12 media pulsed with excitement over @entity96 and @entity1			1
@entity82 , whose government had run into early trouble , was eager to borrow some of the @entity100 ' popularity			2
he sought to replace the highly formal head - of - state to head - of - state relationships of the past with a new , more tabloid - accessible , couple - to - couple relationship			0
thus , although @entity105 and @entity106 were photographed together only on red carpets and around crowded lunch tables , @entity1 and @entity83 figured in dozens of seemingly warm and friendly one - on - one shots			0
@entity82 's successor , @entity11 , needed something quite different from @entity1			2
@entity11 had lived unmarried for 30 years with another senior figure in the @entity113 , @entity114			2
they had four children together			0
in 2007 , the @entity113 chose @entity114 as its presidential candidate			0
after @entity114 's defeat , @entity11 broke off with her , took up with @entity24 and sought and won the presidency for himself			2
unlike @entity82 and @entity83 , @entity11 and @entity24 never did get married			2
today , with his approval rating battered down to 22 % by @entity12 's miserable economic performance and his own vacillating leadership style , @entity11 's public image desperately needs some kind of reinforcement			1
the magazine that revealed @entity11 's affair with @entity18 also posted photographs of the 59 - year - old @entity11 popping on a helmet to ride a motor scooter to his mistress ' home			2
never photogenic , he looked especially absurd			0
parodies ensued , including a video game in which you are @entity11 on his scooter and must dodge paparazzi and his current partner to get to his new girlfriend			2
standing at the @entity140 alongside the @entity100 with a first lady of @entity12 -- any first lady -- might inject @entity11 with a supplemental dose of respectability and dignity			1
that would be the plan , anyway			0
around the world , elected leaders struggle with the question : what to do with the spouse of the head of government ? voters are inescapably curious about and interested in that person , whether she is the first lady of a superpower or a small @entity157 republic			1
the @entity33 solution is to carve out a place for the spouse of the president , with a staff and public duties			1
in turn , that person is expected to submit to certain demands and at least outwardly conform to more traditional norms of behavior			0
it 's an imperfect solution			0
but it 's a better solution than what we see in @entity173 and statehouses , where it has become increasingly common for one spouse to hold high office while the other spouse makes a fortune as a lobbyist -- and where voters are asked to believe that the rising wealth of the private - sector spouse has nothing whatsoever to do with the political clout of the spouse on the public payroll			1
on saturday night , @entity1 celebrated her 50th birthday at a @entity140 dance party			0
the @entity100 ' entertaining has often provoked criticism			2
criticism goes with the first lady role			0
entertain too much , dress too well , and you are @entity195			0
entertain too little , dress too plainly , and you will be mocked as dowdy and boring -- think @entity199			0
look too interested in public affairs , and people will ask " who elected you ? " see @entity204 , @entity205			0
ignore public affairs , and @entity33 will grumble that you are awol from your duties			1
yet as impossible as it is to fill the role of first lady perfectly , it is that much more impossible to pretend that the consort of the head of state is just a private person living in a public building			2
the wife ( someday , husband ; someday after that , same - sex partner ) of the head of state is inescapably a public person , too , with public influence and a public function			0
that function , when well - performed , deserves respect from across the political spectrum			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			2

@entity231 : @entity12 president in a romantic *pickle* that makes him look a little ridiculous
@entity11 has two girlfriends ; which one he brings on @entity33 visit is *burning* question
@entity240 : @entity11 needs the respectability that posing with the @entity100 would bring
@entity240 : @entity243 often do *n't* know what role a " first spouse " plays , but public always curious
