-- there was an important kernel of truth buried in director @entity5 's recent tirade against gentrification			1
@entity8 , like other big cities , has experienced a decades - long economic squeeze in which the cost of housing has soared while wage levels dropped , leaving middle - class families feeling pinched , punished and pushed out			1
@entity5 's 10 - minute , obscenity - laced rant about changes in his old @entity17 neighborhood , @entity18 , was deliberately offensive and , at times , incendiary ( you can listen to it -- uncut -- here )			1
he accused white newcomers to the area of being rude and disrespectful of local culture			0
and in this defense of @entity18 , he sounds somewhat neighborly -- @entity8 could always use a few more polite people -- until you think about it for a minute			0
who , exactly , determines what the local culture is ? to whom is this deference or " respect " supposed to be rendered , and how ? when can the " respect " bill be considered paid in full ? and whatever happened to the idea that law - abiding citizens in a free society should be able to walk their dogs in the park , take yoga classes , sip overpriced coffee at the local @entity45 and otherwise go about their business without having their lifestyle choices judged , ridiculed or attacked ? also , as i 've noted elsewhere , it does n't help @entity5 's case that he sold his own home for $ 1 million in the late 1990s and decamped to the wealthy @entity53 of @entity54 , where he currently resides in a 9,000 - square - foot palace that he bought in 2006 for $ 16 million and recently put on the market with a $ 32 million asking price			1
this is a man who made a fortune by promoting the hipness of black @entity17 , relentlessly and profitably spurring on the very gentrification he now decries			1
there was a better point @entity5 could 've made			1
the real phenomenon of gentrification worth talking about is a national crisis of housing costs that are climbing faster than the earning power of many residents			1
it 's not confined to black neighborhoods , and it 's happening all around the country , not just in @entity8			0
in a fascinating report , @entity76 , a research economist at the @entity77 of @entity78 , examined metropolitan areas to measure the number of census tracts where the housing prices moved from the lower half to the top half for that area			2
between 2000 and 2007 , @entity76 found , housing prices made that leap in 61 % of @entity89 -- the most spectacular increase of any big city			2
@entity92 ranked second , with 55 % of the city 's census tracts with low - cost housing moving into the pricier bracket			2
@entity8 , came in third , with 46 % of the city 's cheaper housing turning not so cheap			0
@entity76 's price - based measurement of gentrification makes far more sense than racially charged anecdotal observations from @entity5			1
looking at these kinds of hard numbers also reveals that , in many cities , gentrification takes place without an ethnic shift			2
it 's middle - class black homesteaders who are gentrifying the @entity114 section of @entity115 , for example			0
and @entity89 is going upscale while remaining an @entity119 - @entity118 bastion			0
what makes gentrification a problem is that earning power for most people is n't keeping up with the rising cost of buying or renting a place to live			0
in @entity8 , the cost of renting an apartment jumped 8.6 % between 2007 and 2011 -- and in those same years , median household income dropped nearly 7 % , according to a report by @entity132 's @entity131 for @entity133			0
that gap between income and rent is the true crisis of gentrification -- and to fix it will require going beyond ethnic and racial finger - pointing			1
what we need is a national campaign to ensure that middle - class wages keep pace with the cost of necessities like food , health care and shelter			0
it wo n't make headlines like @entity153 's rant , but it might replace the heat of blame and resentment with the light of solutions			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity161 .			2

@entity161 : @entity5 *railed* against gentrification in his old neighborhood
@entity5 has profited from the thing he decries . but he also missed point , he says
in many big cities , housing costs rise much faster than incomes
louis : fixing that gap requires more than racial finger - pointing
