-- a @entity3 tour guide 's expletive - laced rant about @entity4 on her last day of work has angered a metropolis used to celebrating the diverse and welcoming @entity8 by the @entity9			1
her performance has gone viral , reaching way beyond her audience of tourists -- perhaps something she did n't expect when she played to the tourists ' smart phones			0
" f - k your little seafood f - ing markets with your turtles and frogs inside , " said the tour guide , using a microphone to shout at her tour group			1
" here in @entity28 , we do n't eat turtles and frogs ... you got to assimilate a little bit , @entity4			2
" her tirade has already gotten more than 600,000 views on @entity35			2
while some tourists on her tour bus applauded , @entity36 -- including the city 's top @entity38 elected officials -- rallied against her speech			0
' @entity44 ended after outrage they include @entity3 mayor @entity47 and city board of supervisors president @entity49 , now running for state assembly			0
" it was amazingly disheartening and disturbing in 2014 that someone would say something so hurtful , " @entity49 told @entity0 on friday			0
" hopefully we 'll be able to use as a learning moment to build on , " he said			0
" not just for this tour guide and company , but for the community to say we stand up against racism and celebration of our diversity			1
" the tour bus company and the tour guide apologized directly to @entity49 , he said			1
in @entity3 , the tour guide 's rant runs counter to the city 's ethos , to say the least			1
