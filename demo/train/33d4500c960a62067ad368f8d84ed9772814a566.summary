-- he spends most of his time playing golf courses all over the world , but @entity6 's thoughts are never too far away from what 's happening on a football pitch much closer to home			1
for the past seven years , @entity6 has been president and part - time player at @entity11 , his hometown club in the province of @entity13 on @entity15 's east coast			1
" it 's good fun and whenever i 'm around i get to practice with them a little bit and play a little bit here and there			0
this season , i 've played probably five games , so not a lot , but i enjoy it , " @entity6 told @entity0 's @entity24 show			2
" as any good @entity29 will tell you , we love football			0
sport in general in @entity15 has been great for the last 10 years or so , but football has been great with the @entity33 ( wins in 2008 & 2012 ) and the @entity35 ( in 2010 )			1
" the 33 - year - old is a long - term supporter of @entity37 , but his domestic allegiances have always been divided between the @entity39 and @entity41 's more modest 1,000 - seater stadium , where his attachment is not only emotional but financial			0
@entity6 's business involvement with @entity41 began in 2003 , explains club vice-president , @entity45 , when one of his friends persuaded him to help out			1
three years later , @entity6 was installed as club president of the club , which plays in group six of @entity15 's third division and now has more than 150 members			1

we make all the management decisions as it relates to the team , " said @entity45			0
" @entity6 has done a tremendous job in the past seven years to create a football academy for @entity41 's young boys and girls			1
" @entity11 's goal is to expand the academy and hopefully promote players from the junior teams to the first team			1
" @entity15 's dominance of international football and @entity75 's @entity74 success in recent years has been attributed to strong grassroots support for the game			1
@entity11 captain @entity78 says @entity6 's assistance has been key to the club 's prosperity			1
" it is very exciting and refreshing to see @entity6 and his team support and work for the team			2
it is just a group of friends who love football and they have a common goal to see the team succeed , " @entity86 said			2
" the team would not be here if it was not for @entity6 's involvement , so hopefully he will be around for a long time to support the club and the village			1
" @entity6 made his playing debut for @entity11 in september 2010			1
swapping golf shoes for football boots is something he does whenever his schedule permits , as it helps him to relax			0
" playing football is not as much pressure because you do n't have that much time to think ... everything is quicker , faster and you are moving all the time , " said @entity6			2
" i have always enjoyed being part of a team and sharing things with your teammates			0
" @entity6 will be looking to rejoin his golfing teammates at next year 's @entity111 in @entity112 , @entity113 where , if selected , he will make a seventh appearance for @entity115 in the biennial match against the @entity117 for now , @entity6 will be reflecting on mixed fortunes in 2013			2
the season was largely overshadowed by the public spat with @entity121 at the @entity122 in may -- a precursor to some unsavory comments about the world no. 1 during a private dinner at @entity127 later that month for which he subsequently apologized			0
but at least the @entity29 has ended the season on a high , lifting his first trophy of the year with a win at the @entity133 earlier this month -- a result that took @entity6 back into the world 's top 10			2
as golfers around the world take a break for @entity140 , @entity6 will be keen to recharge his golfing batteries in the way he knows best -- indulging his other sporting passions			0
" i 've always said i could n't just do golf by itself , " he said			0
" i would probably get tired of it quickly			0
i obviously play football , tennis , paddle tennis and i love watching @entity149 on tv and obviously watching football too			0
" i love my sports and try to keep as busy as i can with them			0
