-- it is a rivalry which can make or break golfers			0
@entity3 vs. the @entity4 , whether in the @entity5 or its male equivalent the @entity7 , is a grudge match as intense as any on the planet			1
it requires players with nerves of steel , who can handle the weight of a continent 's expectations on their shoulders			2
it requires players like @entity21			1
" being out there , the pressure , i get so pumped , " the 24 - year - old @entity22 told @entity0			1
" i just find a different focus out there			0
it 's just me and the ball , and the hole ... it 's just a cool feeling			0
" in pictures : what price golfing perfection ? @entity21 dazzled as @entity3 crushed the @entity4 in august 's @entity5 , winning the trophy on @entity4 soil for the first time with an emphatic 18 - 10 victory			1
it was the biggest winning margin in the 23 - year history of the competition , with @entity21 the catalyst the for @entity3 's dominant display			1
the world no. 23 made history by becoming the first woman to taste victory in all five of her matches , rounding off a victorious weekend with a singles win over former teen sensation @entity48			1
as in @entity3 's 2011 victory , @entity21 did not automatically qualify for the team -- she was one of four captain 's picks in the 12 - woman lineup			1
her place in the record books was in the balance when she and @entity48 approached the 18th tee at the @entity58			2
the match was level and the winner of the hole would take the point			0
for @entity3 , a point for @entity64 would be @entity3 's 14th , ensuring @entity66 's charges retained the @entity5			1
in pictures : the world 's most extreme golf courses " i was the first to tee off and i had a good long drive in the middle of the fairway , " recalls @entity21			1
" i remember telling my caddy , that i 'm just going to aim a little bit left to the pin			0
but when i stood up , i said , ' no , i 'm just going straight at it			0
' " so i hit a really good shot and i heard the crowds			0
it was close , i could hear that and obviously i put pressure on @entity48			0
it was just a nice moment			0
" @entity21 rolled in a four - foot putt for a birdie and the win			1
her place in history , and @entity3 's grip on the @entity5 , was secure			1
it was a moment which saw @entity21 realize the ambitions she had harbored since childhood			2
" i remember walking to school and saying , ' who wants to be a lawyer or a doctor when you can be a professional athlete ? why would you want to do that ? ' " so , i always wanted to work within sports and be a professional athlete			0
i just liked golf the most			0
when i got picked for the national team i was 14			0
that was when i realized that maybe this dream could come true			0
" in order to make her dream a reality , @entity21 headed to the @entity4 to play for college golf for @entity110			1
" it was just the next step , " she explained			0
" i 'd heard that a lot of the older players on the @entity22 golf team went over there and liked it			2
" i thought it was a good step for me to get experience of not living at home			0
it was a difficult decision because you are so worried and anxious , is this going to be alright ? " @entity21 could have joined the @entity123 at the age of 17 by virtue of being one of the two top - ranked players on the @entity22 circuit			1
she turned down the chance of a potentially lucrative kickstart to her pro career to play in @entity132 , a decision she feels has been vindicated			0
" i wanted to go to college and it turned out to be a good decision , " said @entity21 , whose twin sister @entity134 -- her caddy at the 2011 @entity5 -- also played university golf in the @entity4 and is now a fledgling pro on the @entity123			1
" i learned a lot , especially grew as a person when i moved in to the @entity4			2
" having won five let events , and three in @entity143 , @entity21 now is chasing down the big bucks on the money - spinning @entity145			1
a tournament win on the @entity4 circuit is now in her sights			1
@entity21 has been playing @entity145 events since 2008 , with a tie for third at this year 's @entity153 -- one of the five majors -- being her best result			1
she matched that at the @entity157 a week after the 2013 @entity5			2
but , just like the girl who achieved her childhood dream of playing professional golf , @entity21 is confident of capturing that elusive first victory			2
" i really feel like i 'm getting closer and closer , " she said			0
" the @entity5 gave me a lot of confidence			2
" i think i 'm getting closer , hopefully that will happen soon			0
