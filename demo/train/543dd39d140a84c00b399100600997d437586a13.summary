-- @entity2 veteran @entity1 carded six straight birdies on the back nine at @entity4 to revive his third round in spectacular fashion and take a five - shot lead into the final round of the @entity10 's flagship event at @entity4			1
@entity1 , who has been at the head of affairs since a 10 - under 62 in the first round , was slipping back through the field after dropping three shots in his opening five holes saturday until he began his incredible run			1
a birdie on the sixth was the forerunner to his charge from the 11th -- which ended when he missed a three - foot birdie putt on the 17th for seven in a row			0
he completed his round on the 18th with his seventh birdie in eight holes for a five - under 67			0
that took him to 15 - under 201 , with @entity33 's two - time champion @entity32 leading the chasers after a 68			2
@entity36 's @entity35 , who led overnight on 10 - under with @entity1 , was next best , a further shot back			1
former world no.1 @entity38 recovered from a double bogey on his opening hole to card a 69 to be tied fourth on eight - under with @entity43 @entity42 ( 67 ) but seven shots behind the rampaging @entity1			1
" i would have to shoot ridiculously low tomorrow to have any realistic chance but even then @entity1 is so far ahead , " @entity45 's @entity38 told the official @entity10 website			2
the 43 - year - old @entity1 has taken a particular liking to the back nine on the @entity49 , shooting 16 - under for this half as against one - over for the front			1
" i had a terrible start with some poor decisions but i settled myself down and knew i could play this back nine pretty well			0
i got the momentum and kept it going , " he said			0
" i 'm in a strong position going into tomorrow but the job is not done yet			0
" there is a lot of golf to play and i know there are top guys just behind me who can shoot very low as well			0
so i have to maintain my concentration and form to the end			0
" heavy overnight rain delayed the start of the third round by three hours and players were allowed to place their golf balls on the fairways in preferred lies			0
it is the 60th edition of the prestigious tournament with the last 30 stagings at @entity4 , which is also the headquarters of the @entity10			2
