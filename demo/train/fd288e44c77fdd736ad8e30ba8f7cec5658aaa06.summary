-- @entity1 is used to traveling on high - profile missions			1
his 240,000 - mile trip to the moon on july 20 , 1969 , set the precedent			0
on thursday , @entity1 is hitching a ride aboard @entity9 to @entity11 's @entity10 in @entity12 at the invitation of president @entity14 , @entity7 spokesman @entity6 said			1
it appears to be just one of the perks for being on @entity14 's side of the controversy over the president 's new space program , which cancels former president @entity23 's plan to return @entity25 astronauts to the moon by 2020			1
@entity1 supports @entity14 's new space policy , and over the last 48 hours , the @entity7 has made extraordinary efforts publicizing his position			1
aides flooded the @entity7 press corps wednesday with e-mails , forwarding @entity1 's letter to the president			2
in the letter , @entity1 writes , " as an @entity36 astronaut , i know full well the importance of always exploring new frontiers and tackling new challenges as we explore space			1
the simple truth is that we have already been to the @entity44 -- some 40 years ago			0
what this nation needs in order to maintain its position as the 21st century leader in space exploration is a near - term focus on lowering the cost of access to space and on developing key , cutting - edge technologies that will take us further and faster			1
... the president 's program will help us be in this endeavor for the long haul and will allow us to again push our boundaries to achieve new and challenging things beyond @entity64			2
" @entity1 has an op - ed thursday in @entity65 reinforcing his stance			0
putting @entity1 in the spotlight is critical for the @entity7 , which finds itself , so far , on the losing end of the public relations battle			0
those opposing @entity14 's new space policy have tremendous prestige			2
they include @entity74 , the first man to walk the moon ; @entity76 , the commander of the famous apollo 13 flight ; and @entity79 , the last human to step on the moon 's surface			0
the three astronauts sent an open letter to @entity14 calling his plan " devastating " to the @entity25 space program			1
they write that " while the president 's plan envisages humans traveling away from @entity64 and perhaps toward @entity92 at some time in the future , the lack of developed rockets and spacecraft will assure that ability will not be available for many years			0
without the skill and experience that actual spacecraft operation provides , the @entity65 is far too likely to be on a long downhill slide to mediocrity			0
@entity25 must decide if it wishes to remain a leader in space			2
... " when asked if the president received @entity74 's open letter criticizing his new approach to human space exploration , a @entity7 official said , " i do n't think we ever got it			0
" but the @entity7 is getting the message that a lot of people are worried about @entity14 's new direction in space exploration , so @entity14 is making the trip to @entity10 , with supporter @entity1 as his wingman .			1
