editor 's note : @entity2 is the executive director of @entity3 and former @entity5 agriculture secretary			1
last week , @entity3 released its annual report on the @entity8 's @entity7			1
to learn more about the report , visit www.unicef.org			2
@entity2 says the lack of basic necessities makes pregnancy and childbirth fatal to millions			1
@entity14 ( @entity15 ) -- every day in the @entity5 , thousands of women and families experience one of the most joyous occasions in their lifetime -- the birth of a child			1
that joy is certainly not as often the case in many parts of the world			1
women in the least - developed countries are 300 times more likely to die in childbirth or from complications related to pregnancy than women in developed countries			1
half a million women die due to pregnancy or childbirth complications every year			1
the lack of the most basic necessities such as a doctor , nurse , clean water , supplies or even a medical facility is robbing precious innocence and devastating families			1
such services are often sorely lacking in the poorest regions of the world , particularly in @entity49 and @entity50 , which account for the vast majority of all worldwide maternal and newborn deaths			1
conflict , @entity56 and @entity57 , migration and a lack of investment in public health services have made this devastating situation even worse			1
in my travels to these regions , i have seen firsthand the impact of these challenges			2
it 's heartbreaking to hear how women have to walk miles while in labor to reach the nearest hospital , only to arrive finding that there are no doctors available or that the conditions are unsanitary			1
in many cases , both the mother and newborn lose their lives			2
unfortunately , stories like these are not uncommon			0
i recently visited @entity81 , the country with the highest rate of under - 5 mortality in the world			2
one reason for this is that the vast majority of women do not breast - feed their children			0
the women i talk with say it is custom to feed their children rice water			0
this provides little nutritional value and leaves children susceptible to disease and death			0
however , it is illustrative of the challenges we face in reducing child mortality rates			0
educating women , particularly young girls , about critical health issues is a priority for @entity3			0
the younger a girl is when she becomes pregnant , the greater the health risks for her and her baby			0
other factors such as sexual violence and other gender - related abuses pose tremendous challenges and increase the risk that adolescent girls will drop out of school			0
this , in turn , entrenches the vicious cycle of gender discrimination , poverty and high rates of maternal and neonatal death			2
a child born in @entity81 has more than an one in four chance of not living to see his or her first birthday			0
that country also has the worst record for prenatal care			2
regular immunizations , vitamins , rehydration for children suffering from diarrhea and the use of bed nets to protect from malarial mosquitoes are simple and effective ways of keeping women and children alive			0
though the challenges to reach the most vulnerable are high , we are seeing important progress made through international support			1
however , more can and must be done			0
through proven interventions at key stages in life and pregnancy , millions of women and children can be saved each year			0
we know that the vast majority of maternal deaths are preventable when women have access to essential maternity and basic health - care services			1
the most vital need is for more skilled professionals and medical facilities throughout pregnancy , birth and postnatal care			1
@entity3 continues to work with other international agencies to bring more resources to accelerate progress			2
these efforts are designed to reduce these deaths , and we are seeing some remarkable improvements			2
in 2007 , while i was in @entity171 helping open a clean water processing facility , a woman stood up and told me her story			0
every day , she would spend up to 10 hours in search of clean water to ensure her children could drink and eat			0
with clean water now in her community , she can focus on keeping her children healthy and ensuring they are receiving a good education			0
she knows , like so many women around the world in her situation , that the key to ending this suffering is through greater education , awareness and resources to help improve the lives and care of women and children			1
by doing so , we can significantly reduce and eventually end this horrific loss of life			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity2 .			1

@entity2 : in @entity5 , childbirth ends in joy for a very high number of families
she says that 's not true around the world , particularly in parts of @entity50 and @entity49
@entity2 : often , deaths occur due to lack of basic medical care and supplies
she says progress is being made , but more must be done to save lives
