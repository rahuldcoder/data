-- @entity1 says it still " takes my breath away " to talk about his daughter in the same sentence as the man who killed her			0
but he takes comfort in the knowledge that new @entity12 legislation named after his daughter , @entity15 , will help protect other people 's children from sex crimes			1
" if this legislation would 've been in place before , @entity19 would still be with us , " @entity15 said , speaking tuesday about @entity19 , which he and his wife , @entity20 , worked on with state assemblyman @entity21			1
@entity19 's @entity25 is awaiting gov. @entity27 's signature after unanimously passing the @entity28 and @entity29 in a rare display of bipartisanship			1
formally known as @entity33 , the bill creates mandatory sentences of life without parole for specified violent sexual offenses against children			1
another major provision of the 62 - page bill is lifetime parole for people who commit certain sex crimes against minors			1
read the complete text of the bill it 's not the only proposed legislation to arise out of the heinous acts of registered sex offender @entity15 , who admitted in march to killing 17 - year - old @entity15			1
a few days after her body was found , he led authorities to the remains of 14 - year - old @entity15 , who had been missing for more than a year			1
@entity15 was sentenced to three consecutive terms of life without parole for the murders and an attack on a jogger			1
the deaths of the young girls provided impetus for a flurry of tougher proposed laws aimed at protecting children			2
@entity15 ' father is behind three assembly bills concerning law enforcement response to missing children			1
among the legislative proposals : -- creating a rapid response team in the state attorney general 's office to help find abducted children			1
-- reducing the minimum time for reporting a missing child from four hours to two			0
-- enhanced training for police officers who search for missing children			1
the four bills are on their way to @entity27 's desk after being fast - tracked through the @entity84			1
@entity19 also has an urgency clause that means it will take effect as soon as @entity27 signs it			1
the @entity15 bills do not have an urgency clause and would take effect in january 2011			1
the bills could have a ripple effect as @entity15 actively tries to get other states to adopt similar legislation			1
read how @entity19 's killer targeted others the speed of passage was rare for the @entity12 legislature , but not without precedent from other child safety legislation , said @entity101 , president and founder of @entity103 , a nonprofit devoted to fighting crimes against children			1
" @entity12 has a history of responding very strongly to vicious sex crimes against kids , especially in an election year , " @entity101 said			0
" when you have the fresh memory of a beautiful young girl murdered by a person who should n't have been out in the first place , they 're going to respond accordingly			0
" he cited the passage within months of a three - strikes law named for his daughter , @entity118 , who was abducted during a sleepover and murdered in 1993			0
@entity121 , which increased penalties for certain crimes against minors , also passed within months of being introduced , @entity101 said			0
@entity101 said he believes the @entity15 bill will have a more immediate effect than @entity19			1
" @entity127 gets a lot of publicity , but they rarely seem to deliver on the promises			0
other administrative bills are less colorful and more localized , but they have a possibility of helping shore up infrastructure , " he said			0
@entity15 was paroled september 26 , 2005 , after serving five years for two counts of lewd and lascivious acts on a child younger than 14 and a single count of false imprisonment for attacking a 13 - year - old neighbor			1
under @entity19 , lewd and lascivious acts on a minor will carry a mandatory sentence of life without parole			1
the " one - strike " provision applies to forcible sex crimes against minors that include aggravating factors , such as the victim 's age or whether the victim was bound or drugged			1
" because of what he 'd done previously to the 13 - year - old girl , he would have been given life without the possibility of parole , " @entity1 said			2
" he never would 've been let out , and @entity19 never would 've been harmed			2
" king and other supporters say the bill is the most sweeping reform of its kind in recent @entity12 history , touching upon sentencing and parole as well as treatment and funding			0
opponents of @entity19 's law call it another feel - good measure that pushes registered sex offenders further to the fringes of society			1
" no matter how slight the offense , everyone in @entity12 is included in the same net , ridicule , rules and restrictions , " said a @entity176 woman whose adult son is on the registry for improperly touching a 16 - year - old girl			0
he lost custody of his son			0
as a result of residency restrictions , he had to move in with his parents , she said			0
the mother asked that her name be withheld for fear of reprisal against her family			0
" our constitutional rights are violated daily , and no one in this country cares , " she wrote in an e-mail			0
" this new law is yet another ' feel good ' law that further damages families of those on the registry , and will no doubt add millions of tax burdens to taxpayers			0
" the woman and her son live in the same neighborhood where the @entity212 lived when @entity19 was alive			2
after @entity19 disappeared , the @entity15 family asked neighbors to tie blue ribbons around trees in her memory			1
the @entity15 family relocated to @entity218 a few weeks ago			2
" every morning , i awaken to blue ribbons tied to the trees across the street			0
a daily reminder that we are now lepers , " the @entity176 woman said in her e-mail			0
" what happened to @entity19 was an unimaginable tragic event caused by one sick individual			2
" in response to criticism that the legislation took a " one - size - fits - all " approach to punishing sex offenses and managing paroled sex offenders , @entity21 amended the bill in committee			1
it now includes criteria for assessing the risk of recidivism and , based on that risk , placing certain paroled sex offenders under greater supervision			0
the bill also calls for those risk assessment " scores " to be included in the offenders ' online profiles on the @entity250 website , @entity12 's version of the sex offender registry			2
" we will be instituting a dynamic risk assessment , which means it can change on a monthly basis and it will be based on a whole series of factors , not just the crime , " said @entity21 , who introduced the legislation in the state assembly in april			0
the bill also allows the use of polygraphs in parole supervision			0
" this legislation provides experts with better tools than the ones available now to assess risk			0
if you have a sex offender who 's not compliant , their risk assessment level will go up , they 'll get more visits and supervision , " @entity21 said			2
the amended legislation also addresses funding for changes expected to cost tens of millions of dollars over the next decade , according to a preliminary study by the state @entity280			0
the crime of petty theft will be downgraded to a misdemeanor , clearing clogged court dockets and freeing space in jails and prisons			0
despite its broad sweep , @entity1 says the bill 's cornerstone is the one - strike provision			0
" it was my and @entity20 's belief that there was no reason that we could find that people who targeted young children violently could ever be reformed , so why give these violent sexual predators an opportunity to strike twice ? that was our premise and it grew from there , " he said			2
@entity15 said he has identified four states that are interested in adopting similar legislation but he would not name them			2
" i think @entity12 has taken such a strong step forward that i 'm excited about taking @entity19 across the nation			2

@entity314 's @entity19 is one of four bills *stemming* from murders committed by @entity15
@entity19 's law mandates life without parole for forcible sex offenses against minors
three bills backed by @entity15 ' father address missing children searches
bills await *governor* 's approval in what could send ripple effect across country
