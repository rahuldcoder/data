you may have been paying it for 30 years without even knowing			1
but it all ends friday			0
after a protracted legal battle , the @entity3 is removing a small fee from electric bills intended to pay for the disposal of spent fuel at nuclear power plants			1
power companies and state regulators successfully fought the @entity3 over the matter , saying the government has been collecting the fee for 30 years but wo n't begin disposing of nuclear waste for another 34 years			1
in a november ruling , a federal appeals court called the fees " quite unfair " and ordered the government to stop collecting them			1
the change takes effect friday			0
the fee is tiny -- one mill , or a tenth of a cent , for every kilowatt hour generated by nuclear power			1
that amounts to about 15 to 20 cents on the average monthly electric bill , industry officials estimate			2
but those tiny fees add up			0
since 1982 , the @entity32 has grown by about $ 40 billion , and fees contribute an additional $ 750 million every year			0
but interest income means the fund will continue to grow by about $ 1.3 billion a year			0
currently , the fund contains $ 31 billion , after the government spent billions on the failed effort to open a nuclear repository at @entity40 in @entity41			1
waste not removed for @entity44 public service commissioner @entity43 , who fought the fee for years , the court victory is " bittersweet			1
" the lawsuit , @entity43 says , primarily was intended to prod the federal government into solving the nuclear waste issue			1
" from the very infancy of the commercial nuclear power industry , the federal government has always stated that it would take responsibility for the ( disposal ) of high - level nuclear waste , and that has n't happened , " @entity43 said			1
" the waste all sits at the plant sites where it was generated , despite the collection of some $ 40 billion			2
" meanwhile , stockpiles of spent nuclear fuel continue to grow			2
an estimated 2,000 metric tons of waste are generated every year to the 70,000 tons stored at some 100 sites nationwide			2
cooling the fuel spent nuclear fuel typically is stored for five years in pools of water , where it is allowed to cool			2
then it is transferred to dry casks , which are considered safer because they can be cooled passively with air			0
in 1982 , @entity71 passed the @entity72 , which gave the @entity3 a 1998 deadline to begin disposing of spent nuclear fuel			1
after lengthy studies , @entity71 designated @entity40 as the site for a permanent repository of nuclear waste			1
but opposition was intense , both from @entity41 residents and environmentalists			0
and in 2010 , president @entity82 , fulfilling a campaign promise , scuttled the @entity40 program			0
a group of state utility commissioners , power companies and others went to court arguing that the government should not be collecting fees in the absence of a program			1
the court , in turn , pressed the @entity3 to defend the fee , demanding estimates on the cost of future waste disposal efforts			1
it did n't like what it heard			0
the real solution : dispose of waste " according to the @entity107 ) , the final balance of the fund to be used to pay the costs of disposal could be somewhere between a $ 2 trillion deficit and a $ 4.9 trillion surplus , " @entity104 judge @entity103 wrote			2
" this range is so large as to be absolutely useless as an analytical technique " to determining the size of the fee			2
the @entity115 , the industry organization , heralded the decision to kill the fee , and lamented the lack of progress in finding a nuclear waste storage site			1
" on - site storage is safe and can be maintained without any environmental impact			0
but that does not in any way excuse the federal government 's failure to meet its commitment ... to remove used fuel , " it said in a statement			2
@entity43 , the @entity44 utility commissioner , said the fee is " a consumer rip - off			0
" " when you 're paying a fee , you should be getting something for what you 're paying for			0
" but he said the court ruling is an imperfect victory			0
" a perfect victory would have been that the court would compel the federal government to do the program as required by law , " he said			0
@entity43 said he would welcome the return of the fee if it was accompanied by a workable plan to dispose of spent fuel .			0

the @entity3 is removing a small fee from electric bills for nuclear disposal
power companies said the government was collecting the fee for 30 years
but the government is not disposing of nuclear waste
