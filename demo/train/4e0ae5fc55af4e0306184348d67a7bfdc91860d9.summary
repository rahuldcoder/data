@entity0 -- a congressional investigation into the @entity4 's response to the deadly attacks in @entity6 , @entity7 , found that the @entity9 administration failed to protect the compound and recognize the severity of the deteriorating security situation			1
for the partisan report , the investigative arm of the @entity15 - led @entity14 pored over thousands of pages of classified and unclassified written material , witness testimony and classified briefings to piece together the events of september 11 , 2012 , that killed four @entity22 , including ambassador @entity23			2
" this report should be considered one component of continuing comprehensive @entity6 related oversight underway in the @entity22 @entity28 , " the report says			1
since the attack a year and a half ago , conservatives have been skeptical about the @entity9 administration 's account of the events and say they suspect a cover - up			0
just after the attack on the @entity22 compound , @entity9 administration officials said the violence was a result of a protest over a controversial film about @entity42 made by an @entity22 -- a claim that has proved to be untrue			0
while this investigation focused on the role of the @entity4 , it blames the @entity9 administration and secretary of state @entity48 's @entity47 for failing to protect the compound that housed @entity22 personnel			1
the report found : @entity52 officials failed to comprehend or ignored the dramatically deteriorating security situation in @entity7 and the growing threat to @entity22 interests in the region			0
@entity22 personnel in @entity6 were woefully vulnerable in september 2012 because there was no intelligence of a specific " imminent " threat in @entity7 , and the @entity47 , which has primary responsibility for diplomatic security , favored a reduction of @entity4 security personnel in @entity7 before the attack			1
@entity4 officials believed nearly from the outset of violence in @entity6 that it was a terrorist attack rather than a protest gone awry			2
the @entity22 military 's response to the @entity6 attack was severely degraded because of the location and readiness posture of @entity22 forces , and because of a lack of clarity about how the terrorist action was unfolding			1
given the uncertainty about the prospective length and scope of the attack , military commanders did not take all possible steps to prepare for a more extended operation			0
there was no " stand down " order issued to @entity22 military personnel in @entity90 who sought to join the fight in @entity6			0
however , there was confusion about the roles and responsibilities of the personnel			0
the @entity4 is working to correct many weaknesses revealed by the @entity6 attack , but the global security situation is still deteriorating and military resources continue to decline			2
