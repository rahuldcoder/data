-- the scene : @entity3 's short - game practice area last july			1
it 's @entity5 and a boy who looks about 14 is playing from the bunker next to @entity8 and @entity9			1
only his girlfriend is watching him : all cameras are focused on the two @entity13 stars			0
two children are stopping every player leaving the practice ground , asking for autographs			0
when it 's his turn , the young man pauses , smiles and signs			2
he 's just started to walk away when one of the children calls after him : " excuse me , mr. ... " -- the player stops and turns -- " ... but who are you ? " with a slightly shy smile he replies simply , " @entity30			1
" the children are not alone			0
when @entity31 practices on the @entity3 range , an official mistakes him for @entity36 ' ball - boy			1
that most certainly wo n't be happening at @entity38 this week			2
for @entity31 -- who still looks much younger than his 19 years -- has made a big impression since those days of mistaken identity			1
not that he 's changed his modest , courteous demeanor			2
rather , his achievements and actions on and off the course have spoken loudly enough of a rich talent and a steely - quiet determination			2
first , the young @entity13 @entity50 qualifier from @entity51 went on to make the cut at @entity3 , then to win the @entity53 for best amateur			1
the following month he traveled to @entity56 and became the first @entity57 in 102 years to claim the @entity59 amateur trophy			1
then he caused just as big a stir by leaving a top @entity59 college golf scholarship after just one term			1
@entity63 and its coach @entity64 had guided former world no. 1 @entity9 , but @entity31 decided the @entity66 university was n't for him and did n't return from his @entity68 holiday back home in @entity51			1
" the last couple of weeks of university i had a lot of time to think , " he told @entity0 's @entity70 at his hallamshire golf club in @entity51			2
" just studying in my room and i was n't doing much else			0
" i wanted to take my golf as far as i could and i felt like it was hard to keep it progressing			0
i was almost doing more school work than golf			0
" his change of heart lies partly in that clear focus , partly in the chronology			2
he 'd signed his letter of intent with @entity63 after he 'd won the @entity87 in 2012			0
back then , he could only dream of qualifying for the @entity50 , winning the @entity53 and beating the world 's best to claim the @entity89			1
but it happened , life changed and plans had to be rethought			0
the crucial point was that his @entity89 victory had opened many doors			0
invitations to three of the four majors this year , including @entity98			2
a place at the @entity50			0
he could start to put together a schedule that would be the envy of many young pros			0
he 's also had overtures from top agents , including @entity36 's			2
they know a winner when they see one			0
for beyond the raw talent , when you talk to @entity31 's parents and others who 've seen him win at every level from @entity115 upwards , they all speak of two or three other qualities critical for a career in golf			1
his response to pressure : lifting his game when others might crumble			2
and his ability to think himself round a course			0
he puts the latter down to his dad , @entity129			0
" i would always remember lectures coming back from tournaments and he would say , ' why did you hit that club there , there was no need			2
' and i 'd look back and think , ' well , he 's right			1
' " despite the discussions with agents and top players , @entity31 does n't yet know when he 'll turn professional			1
in part it 's so he can take up his invites to the masters , @entity148 and his home @entity50			1
and in part because , as he says , " i do n't know if i 'm ready yet ... i think i have a lot of room for improvement			0
but if you have a top - 10 at the @entity148 or the @entity154 you sort of have to re-evaluate i guess			1
" his immediate goal ? " i would like to be the lowest amateur for all three majors			0
" and so to the first of these this week at @entity38			0
@entity31 will be sleeping in the @entity160 , the traditional lodging place in the @entity38 clubhouse reserved for invited amateurs			1
he 's already played a few practice rounds and ca n't wait to get started			0
it 's a course that demands patience , strategy and a great short - game			1
on that basis @entity31 must have a decent chance of following last year 's 14 - year - old sensation @entity172 of @entity173 , and making the cut			1
if he does , it would be yet another remarkable achievement in a remarkable nine months			0
not that he 'd shout about it : the large contingent over from @entity180 , led by his parents , would do that for him			0
@entity31 himself , the quiet young man from the city of steel , would be knuckling down again , taking nothing for granted in this fickle game , just focusing on the next step to wherever his talent can take him .			1

@entity30 will be one of six amateur golfers lining up at the masters this week
the 19 - year - old qualified by winning last year 's @entity59 @entity195
@entity31 made the cut at last year 's @entity154 and was leading amateur
he has turned his back on a @entity59 college scholarship to focus on his game
