-- comedian @entity1 lost her life after having an apparently minor elective procedure at a @entity5 medical clinic last week			1
the routine surgery was on her throat , according to the @entity8			1
she apparently suffered cardiac and respiratory arrest during the procedure at @entity12			1
she was transferred by ambulance to @entity14 and died on thursday			2
the outpatient clinic is now being investigated by the @entity16 , according to its spokesperson , @entity17			0
no criminal investigation is under way , according to several @entity21 law enforcement officials			0
the state health department is investigating whether there was any malpractice by the doctors and their staff , the same officials said			0
what @entity28 wants at her funeral @entity28 ' autopsy was inconclusive , the medical examiner 's office said			1
the routine nature of the surgery has left some asking how it could have killed her			1
doctors say just because a surgery is called routine or elective does n't necessarily mean it is simple			1
" @entity46 typically just means it is something you can plan ahead of time , as opposed to emergency surgery where you need to get someone in right away , " said dr. @entity41 , chairman of the department of surgery at @entity44 in @entity45			2
when @entity41 talks to his patients about surgery he explains that there are always risks involved			2
there could be complications due to bleeding or infection during the procedure			2
or there could be specific risks related to the type of operation			0
25 of @entity1 ' best jokes @entity12 usually refers to an evaluation of the esophagus or gi tract , according to dr. @entity67			1
@entity67 is an assistant professor of anesthesiology and surgery at @entity70			2
he said sometimes patients will have these procedures so doctors can evaluate their vocal cords			0
endoscopy is normally done under general anesthetic			0
operating on the vocal cords is trickier , because a tube that would normally help someone breathe during such a procedure could n't go across the vocal cords			0
to tolerate that kind of evaluation , @entity67 said , someone would need to be in a deep unconscious state			2
the center has not released the specifics about the kind of procedure @entity28 had , so it is unclear if she would have had a simple anesthetic spray on the throat or something where the airway was compromised			1
" people have endoscopy safely every day in this country , " @entity67 said			0
" generally speaking , it 's well tolerated			0
" there can be risk with surgery if someone has any kind of underlying health problem			1
rivers gave misfit girls permission to dream in the initial surgery consult , @entity41 said he always asks patients : do they smoke ? do they have diabetes ? do they have heart problems or lung disease ? essentially , do they have any kind of physical problem that would put them at an increased risk for complications ? " some doctors will throw in age as a risk , but i would call that ' chronological age , ' because i have some 51 - year - old patients that are physically in much worse shape than someone who is much older , " @entity41 said			1
" she is not someone you look at and say ' that woman looks frail , ' " said dr. @entity130			0
@entity130 , also at @entity44 , sees a number of older patients in the geriatrics department			0
neither he nor @entity41 treated @entity28			1
rivers was a pointed , pioneering comedian " she was vibrant and engaged and great at intelligent conversation , everything someone would want to be when they are older , " @entity130 said			0
but he added , older people , no matter how energetic they appear , do have an inherent age - related disadvantage when it comes to surgery			1
when people get older they have less of what doctors call repertoire and reserve			0
that means their older body and brain lose some ability to cope with stress			0
" older people tend to lose their repertoire and their ability to cope with stress through a variety of reasons and not all of them relate to a disease state			0
they come along with age for everyone , " @entity130 said			2
surgery of any kind , he said , is a real stress on the body			1
that 's what makes surgery riskier for older people			2
@entity1 : @entity174 mourns a friend @entity176 contributed to this report			1

@entity1 suffered complications during minor elective surgery
any kind of surgery comes with risk
age can be a complicating factor for surgery ; @entity28 was *81*
