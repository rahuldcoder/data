-- this week , @entity1 again proved itself to be the nation 's bellwether state when gov. @entity4 signed a law that keeps children and teens under the age of 18 from possibly ruining their future with impulsive mistakes they make online			1
the landmark bill , supported by @entity13 , offers protection in two important ways			0
it requires all websites , online services and mobile apps where a @entity1 minor is registered to have an " eraser button " that lets children and teens remove information that they posted and should n't have -- giving them a chance to recover after posting information about themselves or others that they regret			1
it also prohibits websites , online services and mobile apps directed at minors from marketing certain dangerous goods or services			2
as the recent @entity40 revelations have made clear , each of us leaves a dense trail of digital footprints online			1
at long last , concern is growing about protecting everyone 's privacy			2
but it 's a concern especially for children and teens , who so often reveal before they reflect			1
unfortunately , our laws have n't kept up with our technology			0
@entity50 was first enacted in 1998 when @entity51 was in grade school			0
although recent updates clearly enhance protection for information that websites collect from children under 13 , they do n't apply to teens , who are often more prone to impulsive mistakes			1
@entity1 's @entity61 is the first of its kind			1
at @entity13 , we see it as part of a larger national trend			0
in fact , a similar federal bill , known as the " @entity68 , " is expected to be introduced soon			0
it 's a bipartisan effort led by sen. @entity71 and rep. @entity72 that includes an eraser button provision			0
an @entity76 / @entity75 poll released in june found that nine out of 10 @entity77 believe their personal information is less private than previous generations , and 93 % believe that the next generation will have even less privacy			1
but kids are waking up			0
last year , @entity13 published a study that found some young people yearn for the days before sharing everything on social media was commonplace			0
it even found that digital natives -- those who grew up digital -- actually prefer face - to - face interactions over @entity89			2
of course , eight out of 10 teens use social media , according to a @entity93 study			0
the only glimmer of hope is that our children realize there 's a cost to having tech giants and intelligence agents compile a detailed profile of them as they are evolving into the people they aspire to be			2
the explosive growth of digital devices , smartphones and social media is transforming our children 's lives , in school and at home , with teachers , parents , friends and even strangers			1
even the youngest are migrating online , using tablets and smartphones , and downloading apps			2
these new high - tech tools bring a wonderful potential for learning , communicating and creating -- as well as the potential for our children 's personal information to be widely visible			1
consider this : by the time they 're 2 , more than 90 % of all @entity77 children have an online history			1
at 5 years old , more than 50 % regularly interact with a computer or tablet device ; and by 7 or 8 , many children have cell phones and regularly play video games			2
today 's middle schoolers spend more time with media than with their parents or teachers ; teenagers text an average of 3,000 times a month			0
every little bit of data contained in the touch of a keystroke or the press of a " like " button contributes to an opus of that child 's life -- often revealing details and drawing conclusions about him or her that could have ramifications for years to come			0
children deserve to write their own stories , star in their own movies and discover their own dreams ; they deserve at least a modicum of privacy as they grow and discover their true selves , regardless of what they text or tweet , or where they go on the @entity168			1
but for these positive outcomes to happen , we must confront the privacy challenges in our 24/7 digital world			1
we need legislation , educational efforts and norms that reflect 21st - century realities to maximize the opportunities and minimize the risks for our youth			0
then we will be able to give them the safe , healthy childhood and adolescence they deserve			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity186 .			2
