in case we need any reminder that gun politics can be over the top , there 's the recent report that gunmaker @entity8 regrets supplying weapons to the action flick " @entity12 " and is calling for a boycott			1
why ? it 's not because they 're feeling guilty about triggering violent fantasies in some viewers , but because the star of the movie series , @entity20 , had the gall to tell a reporter that there were too many guns in @entity25			1
there 's no doubt @entity25 are worried about gun violence and support some proposals to keep guns away from potentially dangerous people			1
for example , in poll after poll , @entity25 of all political stripes , including gun owners , support background checks on all firearm purchases			1
( a requirement of that sort was enacted by popular vote last november in @entity42			0
) @entity43 , @entity44 , and a handful of other states , altogether constituting one - quarter of the @entity25 population , have regulations on gun design , transactions , possession or use that go well beyond federal requirements			1
on the other hand , public opinion in support of protecting gun rights has grown in recent decades , and in red states there has been a highly successful effort to deregulate guns			1
the political environment is surely challenging on this issue , but we see several promising policy approaches that are especially well suited to balancing different interests while advancing shared goals			2
the development of " smart " guns promises to give gun owners a new option that many of them would value , namely , a weapon that could only be unlocked by a " key " they control			2
a gun of this sort has been developed by the @entity80 manufacturer @entity79 , utilizing @entity82 technology of the same sort that we have all become accustomed to with our car keys			2
these " personalized " guns wo n't reduce violence by reckless owners , but the technology will cut down on misuse by curious children , suicidal teens , thieves or other unauthorized users who get their hands on the weapon			0
it seems ironic that the effort to block the introduction of such guns in the @entity25 , so far successful , is led by organizations that advocate gun rights			1
most gun assaults occur outside the home			2
when an underage youth , gang member or ex-con is picked up carrying a gun , there is a good chance that a serious crime has been prevented			2
judges must do their part by treating illicit gun carrying as a serious offense , rather than dismissing such cases as " victimless crimes			0
" by analogy , most drunk - driving cases are " victimless " in that no one was harmed , but overall the successful crusade ( by @entity121 and other groups ) to have @entity123 treated as a serious crime has saved thousands of lives			0
reducing illicit carrying would have the same effect			0
recent mass shootings have brought mental health experts and gun violence prevention advocates together to forge sensible approaches			1
federal law disqualifies from gun ownership those who have been involuntarily committed to a mental institution or otherwise ruled mentally incompetent by a judge			0
that disqualification can only be effectively implemented in states that enter their mental health records into the national background check system kept by the @entity143 , a small step in the right direction			0
but federal law is of little use in responding to most cases where a psychotic individual poses a threat			0
a carefully crafted policy is needed to allow judges to order guns removed from those who are found to be dangerous to themselves or others due to mental illness			0
such quick response policies should be coupled with a process to restore gun rights when the danger has dissipated			1
in sum , guns , like many other commodities , create risks as well as benefits			0
in regulating cars , liquor , medical procedures , and much else , there is a balance between risks and benefits			0
that common - sense approach does n't have the drama of a @entity20 film , but it is our best hope going forward .			1

actor @entity20 *criticizes* gun *culture* in @entity25 ; in response , gun advocates call for boycott of his movie
@entity185 and @entity186 : there 's actually a common sense approach to the gun issue
