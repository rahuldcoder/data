a day after confirming it had lost the ability to display @entity3 images , @entity0 has rolled out its own library of retro filters for its @entity7 and @entity8 apps			1
the eight filters are the usual suspects we 've come to expect from mobile photo apps , including desaturated , black and white and high contrast			1
there are auto - adjust and cropping options , as well as a helpful grid view that lets you see what each filter will look like at once			0
" the latest versions of @entity0 for @entity8 and @entity0 for @entity7 introduce a few new ways to enhance the images you tweet , " said @entity0 senior designer @entity21 in a blog post announcing the new features			2
she emphasized that images are important to @entity0 users , and called photos " one of the most compelling forms of self - expression			0
" the new filters were designed especially for @entity0 by photo - editing service @entity35 , which also handles edits for various partners such as @entity39 and @entity40			1
what the effects lack in originality , they will no doubt make up for in popularity			0
filters are an easy alternative to tinkering with an image in a photo editor , and their retro aesthetic has helped @entity3 get more than 150 million users			1
@entity3 also released an app update monday , giving its @entity54 app a fresh new look and adding a new black and white filter			2
there 's a new grid overlay , better tilt - shift effects and a bigger shutter button among other tweaks			0
@entity0 is in direct competition for users and ad dollars with @entity65 , which owns @entity3			1
until this week , if you shared an @entity3 photo on @entity0 , it would appear in the expanded tweet			1
but on sunday , the companies confirmed that feature was no more , the image replaced with a link to the photo on @entity3 's site			2
the addition of in - app filters is great for @entity0 users who did n't like the extra step of launching @entity3 or another photo editing app to spruce up images			1
@entity0 first added the ability to include images in tweets a year and a half ago			0
slight improvements on the individual social networks might not make up for the larger loss of cross-service functionality , but the split between competitors was inevitable			0
if you have an @entity7 device , the updated @entity0 app is available now in the @entity93 store			0
it is coming soon to @entity95 's @entity94 .			0

@entity0 has added photo filters to its @entity7 and @entity54 mobile apps
the addition will help @entity0 compete against @entity65 - owned @entity3
this is the first time the social network has *offered* image editing tools
