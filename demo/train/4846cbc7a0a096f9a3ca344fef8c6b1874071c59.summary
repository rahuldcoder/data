@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 's main political parties sunday reached a deal designed to allow non- @entity6 foreign troops to stay in the country past the end of the year , when a @entity10 resolution authorizing their presence expires			1
@entity1 and @entity13 soldiers during an @entity1 army training session in @entity15 last week			0
the deal would set a deadline of july 31 , 2009 , for all non- @entity6 foreign troops to withdraw , according to @entity17 , a lawmaker with the main @entity19 parliamentary bloc , who spoke to @entity1 state television on sunday			1
the agreement awaits approval by @entity1 's @entity25 , which is expected to vote on the measure on monday , several @entity1 lawmakers said			2
the emergency negotiations came after lawmakers saturday rejected a similar proposal that would have been law			0
sunday 's proposal , by contrast , was drafted as a resolution that would empower the @entity33 to authorize international troop presence without requiring @entity25 to pass a law			0
@entity36 and @entity0 have already worked out a separate agreement that will keep @entity6 troops in @entity1 but tighten restrictions on them			1
countries other than the @entity6 that have troops in @entity1 could be left with no legal cover for their presence there if @entity0 does not act swiftly			1
@entity1 's @entity33 had approved a draft law authorizing non- @entity6 foreign troops tuesday , the first step in passing legislation , but it fell at the next hurdle -- @entity25			1
that left lawmakers scrambling sunday for a way to give foreign troops legal cover quickly			0
lawmakers expect sunday 's agreement to cut through the problem , because a resolution can be passed in a single day , while it takes at least a week to pass a law			0
@entity13 government lawyers , meanwhile , are studying " all possible options " to legally extend the presence of @entity13 troops in @entity1 beyond @entity62 in case @entity1 's @entity25 rejects the new compromise			1
@entity13 has the second - largest contingent of foreign troops in @entity1 -- about 4,100 -- after the @entity6 , which has about 142,500			1
all other countries combined have only several hundred troops in the country			0
@entity13 and @entity1 announced last week that @entity13 troops would begin leaving @entity1 in may 2009 , while a " handful " of @entity13 military personnel would remain after that date to continue naval training for @entity1 sailors , primarily to protect oil platforms			1
the @entity6 reached a security agreement with @entity1 in november			2
that deal , which was ratified by the @entity1 @entity25 , calls for @entity6 troops to leave @entity1 cities by june 2009 , and to be out of @entity1 by the end of 2011			1
beginning @entity62 , @entity6 commanders will have to get prior @entity1 government approval for any operations			0
@entity6 military personnel who commit crimes while not on duty or who commit grave crimes while on duty would be subject to @entity1 legal jurisdiction under the new agreement			2
the @entity6 security agreement does not govern the presence of troops from other coalition countries			2
the @entity25 's rejection of the @entity33 's proposed law allowing foreign forces to remain in @entity1 after january 1 came after heated arguments that lasted for days			2
the session became so contentious that @entity25 's speaker threatened to resign , lawmakers said			0
some political blocs , notably the @entity105 , oppose any extension of the presence of foreign troops in @entity1			1
that group , headed by @entity19 leader @entity110 -- an anti-western cleric -- is demanding an immediate withdrawal of foreign forces			0
@entity2 's @entity114 and @entity115 contributed to this report .			0

new : deal would permit non- @entity6 troops to stay into 2009
new : agreement would set july 31 withdrawal deadline for those troops
