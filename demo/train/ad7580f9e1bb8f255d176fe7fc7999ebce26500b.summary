president @entity0 on saturday nominated @entity1 as his next @entity3 attorney general , describing the two - time @entity3 attorney for the @entity5 as a " tough , fair and independent " lawyer			1
" it 's pretty hard to be more qualified for this job than @entity1 , " @entity0 said at the @entity7 , where he was joined by @entity1 and outgoing attorney general @entity8			1
" i can think of no better public servant to be our next attorney general			1
" the president said the @entity15 overwhelmingly confirmed @entity1 twice before as a federal prosecutor			2
" it 's my hope that the @entity15 will confirm her for a third time without delay , " he said			0
" @entity1 might be the only lawyer in @entity3 who battles mobsters and drug lords and terrorists and still has the reputation for being a charming people person , " the president said			1
@entity1 , 55 , said she was both thrilled and humbled , and thanked @entity8 for " leading by example " and " pushing the department to live up to its name			1
" the first @entity31 - @entity3 woman to hold the nation 's top law enforcement post , @entity1 vowed " wake up every morning with the protection of the @entity3 people my first thought			1
" the nominee , when confirmed by the @entity15 , will replace @entity8 , who announced his plans in september to step down			1
at the @entity7 , @entity0 praised @entity8 , calling him " one of the longest - serving attorney generals in @entity3 history , and one of our finest			1
" @entity1 is a popular prosecutor who is in her second stint as @entity3 attorney in @entity46 , appointed by president @entity0 in 2010 and also serving in the same post from 1999 to 2001 under president @entity49			1
" she has made her name as work horse , not show horse , " said @entity51 legal analyst @entity50 , who worked with @entity1 as a junior prosecutor in 1990			2
" she is someone who tried cases as a junior prosecutor , ran the @entity60 office and then was promoted to @entity3 attorney for all of the @entity5			1
it 's a job that is not terribly glamorous , especially compared to the @entity3 attorney in @entity64 , but it 's a job that she has done twice , " @entity50 said			1
@entity1 would be the second woman to serve as attorney general and the second @entity31 to hold the post			1
@entity1 served on the trial team that prosecuted and won convictions in 1999 against @entity70 police officers for violating the civil rights of @entity72 , a @entity73 immigrant whom police officers beat and sodomized while he was in their custody			1
that experience could help at the helm at the @entity78 , which is overseeing high - profile civil rights investigations , including one into the @entity82 , @entity83 , police shooting of @entity84			0
" she 's absolutely not a partisan lawyer , " said @entity85 , ceo at @entity86 and one of @entity1 's first hires as a federal prosecutor			2
" i am a @entity92 , but she does n't care if people are @entity92 or @entity94			0
she cares about getting the job done			0
" @entity1 has quietly built a solid reputation in @entity70 , where @entity97 , the top federal prosecutor in @entity64 , garners magazine covers and regular media attention for @entity101 prosecutions			1
in a statement , @entity70 police commissioner @entity102 called @entity1 " a remarkable prosecutor with a clear sense of justice without fear or favor			1
" @entity70 attorney general @entity109 said in a statement that @entity1 " has time and time again demonstrated her commitment to ensuring there is one set of rules for everyone and to defending the principle of equal justice for all			1
" her 2010 nomination won @entity15 approval on a voice vote , meaning republicans did n't view her as controversial			0
in recent months , however , she has led the prosecution of rep. @entity125 , @entity126 - @entity70 , for alleged tax fraud			2
@entity125 won reelection this week despite being under indictment , and has called the case against him politically motivated			0
@entity1 was overwhelmingly approved by the @entity15 to be a @entity3 attorney in 2010 , but @entity92 aides said initially friday they do n't know that much about her			1
regardless , the scrutiny she will receive to become the nation 's top law enforcement official will be much greater than when she was picked to be one of 93 @entity3 attorneys			2
@entity1 was born in @entity138 , @entity139 , and earned her undergraduate and law degrees at @entity142			0
senate minority leader @entity143 , who becomes majority leader in january , said in a statement that a decision on the nomination should be made in the new @entity15 in january			0
" ms. @entity1 will receive fair consideration by the @entity15 , " he said			0
" and her nomination should be considered in the new @entity150 through regular order			0
" in a joint statement , @entity92 sens. @entity92 of @entity152 and @entity153 of @entity154 said @entity1 should state whether she believes @entity0 's plan to sign an executive order overhauling immigration laws was " constitutional and legal			2
" the statement also said @entity1 " should not be confirmed in the lame duck session of @entity150 by senators who just lost their seats and are no longer accountable to the voters			0
" sen. @entity163 , @entity164 , who is poised to chair the @entity166 in the new @entity92 - controlled @entity15 , and other top @entity15 @entity92 leaders never got word about the expected nomination from the @entity7 , according to aides			0
" it 'd be nice if the @entity7 called to let us know , " one aide grumbled to @entity51			0
while the administration is not required to inform @entity150 in advance about @entity177 picks , it is often done to give key lawmakers -- like @entity163 and members of leadership -- a courtesy heads - up , or to consult with them and determine whether there would be major opposition			0
@entity92 , a member of the @entity166 , said friday on @entity184 that a vote on @entity1 should n't take place during the lame - duck session and should be put off until the new @entity150 convenes in january			0
" @entity94 senators who just lost their seats should n't confirm new attorney general			2
should be vetted by new @entity150 , " he wrote			0
but another committee member , sen. @entity190 , @entity126 - @entity191 , told @entity51 's @entity192 that @entity1 " seems to be a solid choice " and is qualified			0
@entity190 said he does n't have any problems with her being confirmed in the lame - duck session , noting that other @entity177 picks have been approved during such periods			0
opinion : would @entity1 echo @entity8 on civil rights ?			2

president @entity0 says @entity1 is his pick for attorney general
@entity1 is a @entity3 attorney in for the @entity205 of @entity70
she would *succeed* @entity8 , who announced his *resignation* in september
