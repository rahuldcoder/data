-- @entity1 has announced a plan to " recycle " old e-mail addresses , a move meant to free up accounts for folks who want them but that has sparked privacy concerns			1
in a blog post , senior vice president @entity10 announced that @entity1 e-mail accounts that have been dormant for more than a year will be reset so that active users can have access to them			1
" if you 're like me , you want a @entity1 id that 's short , sweet , and memorable like albert@yahoo.com instead of @entity17 , " he wrote			0
the one - year period will officially begin july 15 , when users can " claim " a dormant account name			1
they 'll find out in mid-august if they got the account they wanted			0
it 's clearly an effort by @entity1 , which has been working to redefine and rejuvenate itself under new ceo @entity26 , to re-engage older users and reward active ones			1
but it has security experts nervous			1
security analyst @entity31 does n't mince words			0
" in short : as an idea it sucks , and it shows @entity1 's lack of respect to customers who created accounts with them in years gone by , " @entity31 wrote wednesday			0
@entity31 lists several scenarios where the plan could backfire			0
they include situations in which a user has another primary e-mail account , but has given their @entity1 address as a backup in case of security situations , lost passwords and the like			1
he said the move appears to be " an underhanded way to get people to re-engage with the site " and that people who may not actively use their @entity1 mail , but use it to store old messages and other documents , could lose them without ever realizing it			2
@entity65 of @entity0 content partner @entity63 , himself the recent victim of a high - profile hack , called the move " a spectacularly bad idea			0
" in the wake of such complaints , @entity1 released a followup statement saying it 's sure the transition can be made without compromising security			1
" we 're committed and confident in our ability to do this in a way that 's safe , secure and protects our users ' data , " the company said			2
the vast majority of inactive @entity80 do n't have a mailbox associated with them , the company said , and any personal data associated with the accounts will be deleted			0
during a 30 - day deactivation period , bounce - back e-mails will alert senders that the deactivated account no longer exists and @entity1 will unsubscribe those accounts from newsletters , commercial e-mail alerts and the like			2
businesses , financial institutions , social networks and other e-mail providers will be sent notifications about e-mail addresses that have been deactivated			2
