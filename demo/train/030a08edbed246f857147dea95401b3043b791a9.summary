@entity0 -- a super pac backed by the billionaire brothers @entity4 and @entity5 is dropping $ 6.5 million into six competitive @entity7 races in a final ad push to send @entity10 candidates to the upper chamber			0
the television ads , which will air in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , link @entity20 candidates in each race to president @entity22 , reinforcing @entity10 messaging throughout the 2014 midterm season that has pushed the @entity20 candidates in each of those states to keep their distance from the president			1
local residents are the face of ads in the six states , saying either " there are lots of reasons " or " there are many reasons " why the @entity38 does n't deserve their vote			1
and the voters go on to say in similar form that , " a vote for [ insert @entity20 candidate here ] is a vote for president @entity22			1
" the ads also close by directly endorsing the @entity10 candidate for @entity7 in each race , a push not seen from groups in the @entity5 political network before 2014			0
that 's because @entity53 is the first super pac in the @entity5 's web of political groups that can do so under campaign laws			2
and while super pacs , unlike nonprofit issues groups , are required to disclose their donors , super pacs can also directly support individual candidates			0
the group was founded in june and the @entity63 donated more than $ 4 million to @entity53 , according to the group 's october quarterly disclosure with the @entity66			1
the super @entity53 has also launched ads in several congressional districts in the last week and plans to push additional ads in key states before the election is over			2
" we 'll launch additional ads , it 's just for these states these are kind of our close out messages , " the group 's spokesman @entity72 said			0
@entity80 contributed to this report .			0

the ads will air in @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18
the ads follow a similar formula *attaching* the @entity38 to president @entity22
the group behind the ad is @entity53
