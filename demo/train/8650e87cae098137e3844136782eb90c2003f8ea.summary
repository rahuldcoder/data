@entity0 , secretary of state under president @entity1 , traveled 23 times to the @entity3 in an ultimately unsuccessful attempt to mediate an @entity7 - @entity6 accord			2
meanwhile , the @entity8 invaded @entity9			2
president @entity11 's secretary of state , @entity10 , has shuttled 11 times to the region in search of the same elusive goal			0
and while @entity17 diplomacy was once again focused elsewhere , the @entity8 invaded @entity18			1
now , in an effort to curb @entity8 , the @entity17 is pausing from its efforts to forge an @entity7 - @entity6 peace to generate international pressure on the @entity23			1
but the pivot may prove impossible , as the issues of @entity8 expansionism and the stability of the @entity3 remain dangerously intertwined			1
late last year , @entity11 faced a daunting choice			0
retaliate militarily for the use of chemical weapons by @entity31 and anger a war - weary @entity17 public or fail to enforce his own red line and severely damage his credibility			1
either way , it seemed , @entity11 lost			0
as the unswerving supporter of @entity31 dictator @entity40 , @entity8 president @entity38 alone had the leverage to mediate between @entity42 and @entity43			1
through his cooperation , an arrangement was made for shipping @entity40 's chemical weapons abroad			0
all sides claimed a victory			0
and while @entity31 has so far parted with only a small portion of its chemical arsenal , @entity11 still cites the agreement as a foreign policy triumph			0
that success could yet turn sour , however , if @entity8 backs out of the deal			0
in reprisal for punitive actions against @entity57 , @entity38 could enable @entity40 to keep his chemical arms and quietly encourage him to use them			0
vividly redrawn , @entity11 's red line would be flagrantly crossed			0
the @entity17 public would still oppose any military response , and @entity17 's enemies in the @entity3 could revel in their newly affirmed impunity			1
@entity38 's ability to exploit the @entity31 civil war to weaken and embarrass the @entity17 pales beside the damage he can inflict on @entity17 through @entity68			1
@entity8 cooperation has been crucial to maintaining the unity of the permanent @entity72 members and @entity73 -- collectively known by the mathematical name @entity75 -- in levying heavy sanctions on @entity68 and reaching an interim agreement on its nuclear program			1
held up as an historic achievement by the @entity11 administration , both the sanctions and the nuclear agreement would be undermined by a @entity8 decision to pull out of the the @entity75 framework and embark on a separate course of unrestricted trade with @entity87			0
while pledging to keep " all options on the table " with @entity68 , the @entity17 clearly wants to avoid the use of force			1
but stripped of all nonviolent alternatives , the @entity17 would have to resort to military action to prevent @entity68 from getting the bomb			1
whether in @entity31 or with @entity68 , @entity8 has played its relatively weak strategic hand exceedingly well and is threatening to outmaneuver the @entity17 in the @entity3			1
though no longer able to dispatch the great blue water fleet that once challenged @entity17 hegemony in the @entity98 , @entity8 is once again asserting its influence in the region			1
and the reason is simple			0
while @entity17 policy has concentrated on the soft power of mediation -- much of it fruitless -- @entity8 has invested in the hard power of military assistance and intervention			1
@entity17 has publicly warned that it may not be able to defend the jewish state from international boycotts related to the peace process			0
and @entity42 has disappointed @entity7 and @entity111 by easing sanctions on @entity68 and striking an interim agreement on its nuclear program			0
@entity8 , by contrast , stands staunchly behind @entity31			1
@entity17 's allies worry whether they might stand alone			2
@entity8 's allies do not			2
the advantage , then , goes to @entity8			0
the erosion can only be stopped -- and @entity8 expansionism checked -- by the reassertion of @entity17 preeminence			1
one way to do that is to aid moderate @entity31 rebels			0
another way is to emphasize @entity17 's determination to stop @entity68 from going nuclear by all measures , diplomatic and military , irrespective of @entity8 's stand			1
and @entity17 must take steps to restore confidence in its dependability as an ally			0
this is not the first time that @entity3 tensions have been linked to @entity8 ambitions in the @entity140			2
back in 1853 , competition between @entity8 and the @entity143 powers in @entity144 triggered a war over @entity8 's control of the @entity147			2
@entity148 and @entity149 eventually stopped @entity8 , but only at an immense material and human cost			0
today , conversely , the struggle over @entity147 could further escalate @entity3 conflicts and lead to even greater violence			2
but that outcome can still be prevented -- not by war , but by reasserting tough @entity17 policies in the @entity3 , protecting @entity17 power in the region and reassuring @entity17 's friends .			2

@entity162 : while @entity17 focused on mediation in @entity3 , @entity8 acted in @entity147
he says @entity8 has influence with @entity31 and relations with @entity68 could upend strategy on nukes
@entity8 has played its cards well , while @entity17 risks being outmaneuvered , he says
@entity162 : @entity17 should reassert itself in the @entity3 and move to protect its allies
