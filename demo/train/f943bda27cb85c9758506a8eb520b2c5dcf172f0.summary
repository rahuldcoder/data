-- @entity1 is looking at introducing tough controls on its carbon pollution as soon as 2016 , in a shift that could boost talks on a global agreement to curb greenhouse gas emissions , an official at the heart of state carbon policy has said			1
@entity1 , which accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions , has resisted international pressure to commit to absolute cuts in its emissions , which are the world 's highest			1
instead , it has said it will lower its " carbon intensity " , or emissions relative to economic output			0
however , the powerful economic planning ministry is considering an outright cap on emissions for its next five - year plan ( 2016 - 20 ) and is studying what level would be appropriate , @entity22 said			1
that could help to break a deadlock at the heart of @entity32 climate talks , which are aiming to agree a legally binding global deal on cutting emissions -- at a 2015 meeting in @entity36 -- that would take effect from 2020			1
mr @entity22 , a carbon policy researcher at the @entity38 , said : " i am sure @entity1 will have a total emission target during the 13th five - year plan			1
" mr @entity22 , whose department is influential in shaping @entity1 's carbon policies , said a target for total emissions would be " more effective " than the previous intensity target			2
he added it was " very possible " @entity1 might drop its longstanding opposition to carbon caps for developing nations before the @entity32 climate talks in @entity36 in 2015			1
" the whole world needs to come up with a good protocol , and this should be the last protocol , otherwise we will not have time , " said mr @entity22 , referring to the @entity36 climate talks			2
@entity1 's emissions cap would be linked to the existing caps on coal consumption , he said			1
another reason for the changing stance is the growing public debate over air pollution in @entity1 , where it has become a public health crisis as well as a political issue			0
no official announcement has been made about an absolute emissions cap but mr @entity22 's comments mark the first time @entity1 's carbon policy makers have spoken publicly about such a plan			1
his remarks are in line with a shift in @entity1 's position that some say has been evident in recent closed climate talks outside the formal @entity32 negotiations			1
the @entity32 talks have stalled because the @entity81 and other wealthy western countries say they can not approve a deal until big developing countries such as @entity1 drop their historical opposition to making the sorts of emissions cuts that have so far only been demanded of industrialised powers			1
@entity89 , the @entity90 environment minister , said that both @entity1 and @entity91 had made " very positive sounds " about such a shift at a meeting of the so - called @entity95 in @entity96 in april			0
" both @entity91 and @entity1 were saying things that i 'd never heard before , " mr @entity89 said			0
they were among countries that had until now been " reluctant to step up and step away from " their previous positions on curbing emissions but " all of a sudden were making some very positive sounds "			0
he added : " we still have a way to go , but it was very encouraging			0
@entity1 and @entity91 in particular , i think we 're seeing movement from them to eventually make commitments			0
" the @entity95 includes the @entity81 , the @entity110 and the @entity112 nations			0
the combined emissions of its members account for more than four - fifths of all fossil fuel greenhouse gas emissions , far more than the 15 per cent covered by the only existing global climate treaty , the @entity118			0
@entity1 's leaders , @entity120 and @entity121 , have forged ahead with efforts to control carbon emissions since they took office in march			2
after several years of preparation , @entity1 is this year launching seven pilot carbon exchanges , which are envisioned as a testing ground for a possible national emissions tradition scheme later			2
part of the reason for @entity1 's enthusiasm for controlling emissions is that policy makers see these controls as a way to rebalance @entity1 's economy away from energy - intensive , resource - intensive sectors and towards " cleaner " sectors such as services and technology			2
it is still unclear how @entity1 's carbon cap would be enforced , and whether it would be a firm limit or a loose target			2
a second policy maker who works on carbon policy at the @entity38 declined to comment on the carbon cap , saying only that " no announcement has been made so far "			0
the @entity38 did not respond to faxed questions about a future carbon cap			0

@entity1 may introduce checks on carbon pollution by 2016
a @entity1 policy expert says the economic planning ministry is exploring an emissions cap
@entity1 accounts for nearly a quarter of global carbon dioxide emissions
tough emission controls in @entity1 could help break a deadlock in @entity32 climate talks
