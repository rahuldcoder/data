a train crash in @entity1 , @entity2 , that killed at least 80 people and injured 178 more wednesday poses many questions for investigators , who are homing in on what role the train 's speed may have played in the crash			1
the issue of high - speed rail may raise more questions for the public at large , specifically in the @entity15 , where high - speed trains are rare			1
here are some basics on this speedy mode of transportation : what is high - speed rail ? it depends where you are , but the @entity24 says the term is reserved for systems ( not just trains ) designed for speeds of more than 250 kph ( 155 mph ) if the lines are new and speeds up to 220 kph ( 137 mph ) if the lines are upgraded			1
certain trains in @entity32 and the @entity33 can exceed 300 kph ( 186 mph ) , while a handful around the world can top 400 kph ( 249 mph )			2
the term can also be used for trains that move at speeds between 110 kph and 180 kph ( 68 mph to 112 mph ) in certain circumstances , such as the need to avoid " noise and nuisance , " or the need to traverse long tunnels or bridges			2
how is high - speed rail different from nation to nation ? as stated above , @entity32 and the @entity33 have trains that can exceed 300 kph ( 186 mph ) , which means , in @entity32 , trains can zip between @entity52 and @entity53 in about five hours			1
the regular train route takes twice as long , and you 'd be lucky to finish the journey in a car in 13 hours			0
in @entity60 , the @entity59 bullet trains typically travel at between 270 kph ( 169 mph ) and 320 kph ( 199 mph ) , while @entity62 cars can travel up to 305 kph ( 190 mph )			2
in march , @entity64 's @entity63 hit a speed of 421.4 kph ( 261.8 mph ) in a test run , making @entity64 the fourth country -- behind @entity68 , @entity32 and @entity60 -- to develop a train capable of topping 420 kph ( 261 mph )			1
@entity2 has high - speed trains , known as @entity71 , that move at speeds up to 310 kph ( 193 mph ) , according to @entity73 , but the train involved in this week 's wreck was not an ave. it had a max speed of 250 kph ( 155 mph )			1
is high - speed rail available in the @entity15 ? @entity79 operates a service in the northeastern @entity15 called @entity81 that is capable of speeds up to 241 kph ( 150 mph ) and can travel between @entity83 and @entity84 in about 96 minutes			1
other stops on the route include @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , @entity91			0
responding to critics who say @entity81 is too slow and too infrequently reaches its top speed , @entity79 announced in september that it plans to run test trains at 266 kph ( 165 mph ) in @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 , @entity98 and @entity99			2
what does the future hold for high - speed rail in the @entity15 ? early in the @entity105 administration , federal transportation officials called on states to spend money to develop faster rail systems using existing lines			1
the plan identified 10 potential high - speed corridors for federal funding , and the @entity113 proposed spending $ 53 billion over 25 years to create the national network			1
among the corridors : @entity116 , the @entity117 , the @entity118 , the @entity119 , the @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity83 and @entity123			0
the blueprint envisioned some trains traveling at top speeds of more than 150 mph			2
but there have been many snafus			0
in 2010 , transportation secretary @entity129 redirected $ 810 million from @entity130 and $ 400 million from @entity131 after those states ' governors cited opposition to the projects			0
the tussle over budget cuts further hampered funding in 2011			0
that same year , @entity122 gov. @entity139 rejected a plan to run high - speed rail between @entity142 and @entity143 ( and eventually spread to @entity144 and @entity145 )			1
@entity122 subsequently lost $ 2.4 billion in federal funding , and 24 states submitted requests for portions of @entity122 's allotted money			0
in @entity116 , billions of federal dollars were pledged for high - speed rail , and voters ok 'd $ 9 billion in bonds for a bullet train between @entity155 and @entity156 , but the project has been set back by myriad issues			1
are there safeguards in place in the @entity15 that would help prevent a disaster like the one in @entity2 ? yes			0
in fact , those safety regulations may be at the core of why it 's difficult for high - speed rail to proliferate in the @entity15			1
according to a june report from the @entity169 , a libertarian think tank , the @entity174 " has strict crash safety regulation for passenger railcars which trains in @entity172 -- where passenger rail is well established and remarkably safe -- do not have to meet			0
" while the @entity15 requires the undercarriage of a train to withstand 800,000 pounds of force without " permanent deformation , " @entity172 designs " trains to gracefully deform in a controlled manner " so that crumple zones absorb the energy of the crash , an approach known as crash - energy management			2
the " buff - strength " for @entity172 trains is 337,200 pounds of force , according to the think tank			0
the @entity174 has other requirements not present in @entity172 safety regulations , including requiring that the end of the train have the resistive strength of a half - inch plate of steel and an " anti-climbing mechanism " that prevents train cars from telescoping and mounting each other			0
" the requirements force @entity79 and transit authorities across the country to purchase custom - made trains that are unnecessarily expensive , underperform and do not meet the best safety practices of the rest of the world , " the @entity169 report said .			0

high - speed rail can range in speed from 110 kph to more than 300 kph
some countries have trains that can exceed speeds of 420 kph ( 261 mph )
train involved in @entity2 crash was not the country 's fastest class of train
@entity113 has pushed for high - speed rail , but plans beset with *problems*
