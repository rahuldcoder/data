-- " plastics deliver bountiful benefits to you and your world , " exclaims the @entity2 web site , the online home of the @entity5 plastics industry trade association			1
if it seems a bit over the top , imagine your life and " your world " without plastics			2
even die - hard steampunk fans might have second thoughts about a plastic - free existence			2
as just one small example , imagine what a take - away meal would be like : served on a real plate with cutlery , carried in a wooden box hammered together with nails			0
perhaps that 's a bit extreme , but you can be sure without plastics a " spork " would never have made the impact it has in your life			0
the @entity2 then are right to gush ; plastics have done much to improve our lot , but plastics also have a dark side			1
they have become the scourge of the environment with plastics bags and bottles filling up landfills , littering streets and the manufacture of plastics polluting the environment with hazardous chemicals and endangering health			1
some plastics are worse than others when it comes to leaving a mark on the environment , but an increasing number of them can be recycled			1
one common misconception when it comes to plastics is that the number displayed in a little triangle of arrows means it can be recycled			1
it actually denotes what type of plastic the material is made of			1
most countries have recycling schemes that can easily recycle plastics with the numbers 1 , 2 , 5 and 6			0
plastics with number 3 , 4 and 7 are much harder to recycle			1
som experts believe there are also some health concerns about chemicals leaking from plastic containers with the numbers 3 , 6 and 7			2
the chemicals could leach into food or drink if used for a long time or heated			0
plastics with numbers 1 , 2 4 and 5 are safe to contain food and drink			0
one chemical that has expert worries and can be present in plastics with the number 7 is bisphenol a ( @entity89 )			2
some scientists have claimed @entity89 can be a hormone disruptor and lead to illnesses such as cancer and impaired childhood development			0
last year @entity95 became the first country to ban baby bottles that contain @entity89			0
