@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 activists supporting a bill that would slash collective bargaining rights of @entity1 public employees flocked to @entity0 on saturday , bringing a new dimension to a budget battle that shows few signs of compromise			1
as tens of thousands of people marched in favor or against the bill , @entity12 gov. @entity12 indicated he has the votes to pass it			1
" we 're going to stay firm on it , " he said on the fifth day of large protests and political wrangling in the capital , which saw the arrival of conservative groups			1
" @entity1 is ground zero , " said @entity25 , president of @entity26			2
" i think it is going to determine largely whether the pampered nature of these public employees is finally reined in			2
" @entity12 has called on 14 @entity32 state senators , who fled the state rather than allow a quorum permitting a vote on the bill , to return to @entity0			1
@entity38 opponents say they wo n't allow a vote unless @entity12 negotiates on the plan to eliminate collective bargaining rights for everything but wages			2
the legislation also would require most employees to pay more for their pensions and health insurance benefits			2
" i have been informed that all state and local public employees -- including teachers -- have agreed to the financial aspects of gov. @entity12 's request , " said sen. @entity48 , a @entity49			2
" this includes @entity12 's requested concessions on public employee health care and pension			2
in return they ask only that the provisions that deny their right to collectively bargain are removed			2
this will solve the budget challenge			1
" @entity12 , who says the state is " broke , " is asking legislators to pass his @entity38 to combat a $ 137 million shortfall through june 30			0
an upcoming two - year budget for 2011 - 13 must address a pending $ 3.6 billion deficit , he said			1
opponents say the proposed legislation is an attack on workers ' rights			0
until saturday 's counter-demonstrators appeared , the growing protests since monday were largely made up of those against @entity12 's plan			0
they remained the clear majority of those marching ; many were drawn saturday by the arrival of @entity12 's supporters			0
there were no reports of major incidents or arrests by late saturday afternoon , and authorities expressed their gratitude			0
" on behalf of all the law enforcement agencies that helped keep the peace on the @entity94 saturday , a very sincere thank you to all of those who showed up to exercise their first amendment rights , " @entity0 police said in a statement			1
" you conducted yourselves with great decorum and civility , and if the eyes of the nation were upon @entity1 , then you have shown how democracy can flourish even amongst those who passionately disagree			1
" teachers and other public employees kept the pressure on the governor to go to the bargaining table			1
@entity0 teacher @entity111 said she would n't have gone to college if her father had not been in a union			1
" this will break the backs of middle - class families , " she told @entity2 affiliate @entity115 , adding @entity12 should be willing to negotiate			1
the governor 's press secretary , @entity119 , released a statement saturday calling on @entity48 , senate minority leader @entity122 and other @entity123 to return from @entity124			1
" these are many of the same senators who , two years ago , rammed through a billion dollar tax hike in 24 hours with no public input , " the statement said			0
" the quickest way to resolve the current situation is for the @entity32 senators to stop shirking their responsibilities and debate the bill in @entity0			1
" saturday 's protests inside and outside the @entity94 were the largest of the week , numbering about 55,000 , said @entity137 , spokeswoman for the @entity138			0
friday saw about 40,000 demonstrators , @entity137 said			0
the conservative group @entity141 helped organize the " @entity143 " campaign evident this weekend in @entity0			1
" buses will be coming from across the state , bringing citizens fed up with big union contracts and bloated government , " the group said on its website			0
" we win here , we win everywhere			0
" the defecting @entity32 lawmakers say they wo n't return until @entity12 agrees to negotiate with the teacher 's union on the governor 's proposals to reduce the state 's budget deficit by cutting benefits for its members			1
they also want language removed from the bill that critics say threatens the existence of all public employee unions in the state			2
@entity170 press secretary @entity169 addressed the continued protests friday , saying president @entity179 " is very understanding of the need for state governments , governors , state legislatures to reduce spending to make tough choices to be fiscally responsible			0
" but he added , " he also feels very strongly that we need not to make this an assault on the collective bargaining rights of workers in any given state			0
" he understands public employees need to make sacrifices just like everyone else			0
" @entity12 's proposed legislation requires workers to cover more of their health care premiums and pension contributions , although supporters say local governments will decide on health care contributions for their employees @entity12 contends the increases are " modest " compared to what workers in private industry pay			0
it also requires collective bargaining units to conduct annual votes to maintain certification , a costly procedure , and eliminates the right of unions to have dues deducted from worker paychecks			0
@entity2 's @entity208 and @entity209 contributed to this report .			0
