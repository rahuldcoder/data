there is no middle - of - the - road opinion on @entity2 , the " friend , not - girlfriend " of @entity4 who testified in the @entity7 trial wednesday and thursday			1
some people see a surly , unreliable witness who 's been caught telling several whoppers over the past year			1
others see your average working class teenage girl , trying her best to stay composed while retelling the story of the death of her close friend under the most grueling of circumstances			0
which one did you see ? it probably has a lot to do with what demographic boxes you check to identify yourself			0
since @entity7 was arrested , legal analysts have predicted that @entity4 's " girlfriend , " who was talking to him on the phone when he encountered @entity7 last february , would be a crucial witness for both sides			1
for the prosecution , @entity2 establishes @entity4 as a scared teen who was trying to run away from a stranger ( @entity7 ) on his way back home			1
for the defense , pointing out the various versions of events @entity2 gave in interviews with the press , @entity39 and the police would be essential to poking holes in the prosecution story that started off strong on day one			1
but that 's just strategy			2
the real impact of @entity2 is how a jury -- made up mostly of white women and mothers whose only knowledge of @entity4 comes from his friends and family -- would view this young girl			1
the moment @entity2 sat down on the witness stand and started talking , my @entity62 account and the @entity65 timeline exploded with comments : " her story has been inconsistent			1
i do n't think the state should have called her , she 'll never survive cross			1
" " she is a horrible witness			2
the repetitive nature of her testimony is uggg			2
" " i would be pissed if my daughter / son talked & behaved this way while testifying " " @entity2 is being made fun of and slandered on @entity62 because of her looks and the way she talks			1
" these were comments that exploded in the @entity79 mere minutes into @entity2 's testimony			1
why ? part of it is because she is a dark - skinned , plus - sized girl from a low - income neighborhood who does n't speak the @entity87			2
with that profile , some viewers automatically see her as non-credible and uneducated , and every frustrated or irritable word coming out of her mouth reinforced the stereotypes of black teens that all too many @entity96 ( of all colors ) believe in			0
this is key because most of @entity100 's criticism was expressed long before cross-examination , when the holes in her story were exposed			2
this does n't mean that any juror or viewer who found @entity100 problematic is necessarily prejudiced or @entity108			0
however , the swiftness with which she was viewed as a good or bad witness by some had more to do with how she looked than what she actually said			0
on the other side , an almost equal number of people -- mostly parents , young people , minorities , and those who work with young people -- found @entity2 to be a normal girl in abnormal circumstances			1
a single friend of mine in her 30s watching the trial in @entity126 , said to me : " imagine if you had to get on the witness stand and talk about how the boy you had a crush on was shot and killed right after you got off the phone with him			1
you 'd be upset and nervous , too			0
" if you work with teenagers or are raising them , you might have found @entity2 more sympathetic than abrasive			2
if you do n't watch much news , maybe you chuckled and identified with the high school senior when she assumed all criminal investigations looked like " @entity137 " on @entity138			0
what some people viewed as sketchy behavior , others saw as authenticity			0
ultimately , after a cross-examination that was sometimes tense , sometimes hostile , and definitely riveting , we are left to determine whether @entity2 swayed the case for the prosecution or for the defense			2
that depends less on what came out of her mouth than on how the jury saw her before she opened it			0
if they saw a 19 - year - old woman who was hostile , irritable , and a walking - talking racial stereotype , it probably hurt the prosecution and painted a poor picture of @entity4			0
if they saw a senior in high school who was nervous , sincere , and obviously still in mourning , it likely hurt the defense 's narrative			0
more than any other witness so far , i think the public will be split on @entity100			0
no one is going to be swayed from their first impression no matter what she does , and that 's never a good thing , no matter what side of this case you 're arguing .			0
