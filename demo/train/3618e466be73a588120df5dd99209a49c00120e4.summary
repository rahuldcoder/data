-- best known for quirky rom - coms like " @entity3 , " " @entity6 " and " @entity7 , " @entity1 returns this weekend in a gothic murder mystery entitled " @entity5			1
" @entity1 plays author @entity8			1
but instead of treating the story like your standard biopic , the author finds himself at the center of a serial killer investigation , where the killer is using @entity8 's work for inspiration			1
in a rare instance in which a film portrays a writer as an actual hero , the downtrodden @entity8 becomes integral in solving the case , with @entity1 portraying the famed writer in a very serious and dark manner			1
@entity0 recently spoke with @entity1 about channeling @entity8 and the mash - up styles " @entity5 " uses as inspiration			1
@entity0 : @entity8 is quite insane at times			1
do you relate to him at all ? @entity1 : it 's funny , we were talking to people and somebody says that @entity8 reminded them of @entity31			1
everybody has some tangential relationship to [ @entity8 ]			1
he represents this singularity and a defiance , intellectually so rebellious , and so tragic and sad			0
he 's almost like an archetype of a young shadow ... he 's the @entity38			2
the reason he 's so famous and stands the test of time ... he led an eccentric life , and a really sad life ; tormented , but he represents some sort of collective sorrow			2
anybody who wants to be an artist in any way , an actor or a writer , in trying to express the world in some way , @entity8 is the blasted soul , the perpetual orphan out there who houses all of those feelings			1
i think that 's what he represents in the collective way			2
@entity0 : you mentioned @entity31 -- both died and their work has lived on , assimilating in different ways into the collective consciousness			2
@entity1 : yeah , i can see [ @entity8 's ] writing influencing @entity68 , who i knew and was a friend			1
his influences are all over : from literary , music , fashion , everything with this writing about the space between life and death , between being awake and dreaming			0
when he was 20 years old , he said " i could not love , except where death was mingling his with beauty 's bated breath			2
" so he 's always juxtaposing almost idolatry -- the eternal feminine and the harshness of the world			0
he 's always caught in that space			0
@entity0 : and although he was published , he was poor mainly because copyright is n't what it is today in terms of royalties and paying artists			0
@entity1 : there was no copyright at all , so he got paid $ 6 for " @entity5 " and then it went all over the world			1
he was one of the first persons to try and make a living as a writer			0
writing for pennies per word			0
he was really destitute and struggling			0
at one point he was eating dandelion salads			0
@entity0 : " @entity5 " itself is very dark and gruesome at times			1
@entity1 : well , we always went back to the source material			1
we thought the construct was very @entity8 - like , where @entity8 becomes a part of one of his stories and swept up in one of his genres			1
i thought that conceit was very smart ; you have to have @entity8 deconstruct his own stories to find the killer			1
so , not only do you get to use all the attitudes about his own work , but you also have the other thing , " am i going insane ? " bit			0
the dance with the abyss , the madness , the mental illness			0
you have all those things and try to do a story that is fiction that tries to get you inside the head of @entity8			1
it allows for more scope than i think a biopic would			0
@entity0 : it 's a very meta - treatment of his life and work			2
@entity1 : it 's one of these weird things , if you go into it thinking this is " @entity142 " or a " @entity145 " version of a really depressed guy ... if you do the research , he was very brutal and mercurial in his moods			1
he was n't this inward looking sorrow master			0
if you understand his writing , he was an esoteric poet on a master level , but also writing pulp for saturday afternoon thrillers			0
someone said , " why has n't the story of @entity8 been done ? " i do n't think anyone 's figured out how to get the breadth of him			1
this was a way to get into him , his stories and mix it with some fantasies			0
you 're right in when you describe it as a meta - treatment			0
that is what we were going for			0
people need to understand what they 're seeing or looking at is the film that we intended to make			0
it does need a little bit of context ; you need to have read @entity8 a little bit more than @entity174 class to get what we were going for			2
@entity0 : @entity8 was alive when horses were the main source of travel			2
do you feel comfortable acting while riding on horses ? @entity1 : yeah , yeah , i do n't mind doing that stuff			2
i 'm good with horses			0
@entity0 : how would you classify " @entity5 " ? @entity1 : i think it 's a mash - up of a few things : horror , thriller , a bit fantasy , but it 's also a character study and a look at the creative process			1
@entity193 and genres that @entity8 made			2
there 's a tendency to put things in these boxes , but i think @entity8 was doing a lot of things			1
he created a lot of these genres .			0
