-- one year ago , the enemy that had haunted @entity3 for nearly a decade met his end in @entity5 , @entity6			2
@entity7 is no longer a threat to the @entity3 because of president @entity10 's leadership and strong national security policies			1
good intelligence practices and surgical counterterrorism operations enabled us to kill 20 of @entity16 's top 30 leaders , including @entity7			1
this is an accomplishment by any measure			0
we have diminished @entity16 's strength , so for the sake of our economic and national security , we should decrease our military presence and bring our troops home from @entity24 as soon as is safely possible			1
according to the latest @entity29 / @entity28 poll , more than two - thirds of @entity3 think that the @entity3 should no longer be at war in @entity24			1
the president 's plan started by withdrawing 10,000 @entity3 troops from @entity24 between june and december 2011			1
the 33,000 " surge " troops assigned in 2009 are scheduled to leave @entity24 by this summer			2
we will continue the troop drawdown until 2014 when , if all goes according to plan , a strengthened @entity24 force and @entity40 troops will maintain peace			2
but with our core mission of decimating @entity16 in @entity24 accomplished , is the continuing military presence until 2014 worth the cost ? more than 1,900 @entity3 have died in @entity24 , and more than 15,000 have been wounded			1
attacks with improvised explosive devices increased last year and have caused a surge in double amputees			0
a recent study found that one in four @entity24 and @entity51 veterans were diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder between 2004 and 2009			0
unlike the @entity3 ' adversaries of the 20th century , @entity16 is a mobile force that is not confined by borders			1
according to @entity58 reports , in 2010 there were fewer than 100 @entity16 fighters in @entity24			2
clearly this small number does not warrant our large - scale troop presence there , which peaked at 100,000 last year			0
the justification that we should stay in @entity24 to prevent @entity16 's return is unconvincing			1
@entity16 operates in lawless states , such as @entity67 and @entity68 , with relative ease			0
but it makes no sense to put tens of thousands of boots on the ground in those countries			0
since our enemy is not limited by borders , why do we continue to put the lives of our brave troops at risk and spend billions of taxpayer dollars to secure one country ? communities nationwide feel the financial effects of keeping our troops in @entity24			2
@entity85 are demanding drastic domestic spending cuts that are hurting people here at home			0
at the same time , the proposed budget for the war in @entity24 for 2013 is $ 88 billion			2
the annual cost to support one @entity3 soldier in @entity24 is more than $ 1 million , according to the @entity93			1
that figure would employ about 35 @entity3 here at home through federal infrastructure spending			0
instead of spending billions on a war that is not making us safer , we could better advance @entity3 national security by providing greater support to people in @entity105 countries fighting for freedom and democracy			1
supporting their democratic aspirations and protecting their human rights , not just with words but also through bold actions , is the surest way to turn back anti-americanism and terrorism in the region			0
@entity117 should support president @entity10 in making these changes			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity121 .			0

@entity121 : two - thirds of @entity3 think it 's time to take @entity3 troops out of @entity24
we accomplished our mission , he writes : @entity7 , @entity16 leaders are dead
the cost of troops in @entity24 takes away from @entity3 communities , he says
@entity121 : the *funds* are better spent supporting @entity105 democracy movements
