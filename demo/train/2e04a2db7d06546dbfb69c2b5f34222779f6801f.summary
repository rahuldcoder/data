editor 's note : @entity2 , professor at @entity3 , was awarded the @entity4 in 2001 for his work on the economics of information and was on the climate change panel that shared the @entity9 in 2008			1
@entity2 , a supporter of @entity10 , was a member and later chairman of the @entity12 during the @entity14 administration before joining the @entity15 as chief economist and senior vice president			1
he is the co-author with @entity18 of the " @entity19 : the @entity20			2
" economist @entity2 says federal regulators and executives helped create the @entity24 crisis			1
@entity25 ( @entity26 ) -- many seem taken aback by the depth and severity of the current financial turmoil			2
i was among several economists who saw it coming and warned about the risks			1
there is ample blame to be shared ; but the purpose of parsing out blame is to figure out how to make a recurrence less likely			2
president @entity40 famously said , a little while ago , that the problem is simple : too many houses were built			0
yes , but the answer is too simplistic : why did that happen ? one can say the @entity46 failed twice , both as a regulator and in the conduct of monetary policy			1
its flood of liquidity ( money made available to borrow at low interest rates ) and lax regulations led to a housing bubble			1
when the bubble broke , the excessively leveraged loans made on the basis of overvalued assets went sour			1
for all the new - fangled financial instruments , this was just another one of those financial crises based on excess leverage , or borrowing , and a pyramid scheme			1
the new " innovations " simply hid the extent of systemic leverage and made the risks less transparent ; it is these innovations that have made this collapse so much more dramatic than earlier financial crises			1
but one needs to push further : why did the @entity46 fail ? first , key regulators like @entity74 did n't really believe in regulation ; when the excesses of the financial system were noted , they called for self - regulation -- an oxymoron			1
second , the macro-economy was in bad shape with the collapse of the tech bubble			1
the tax cut of 2001 was not designed to stimulate the economy but to give a largesse to the wealthy -- the group that had been doing so well over the last quarter - century			1
the coup d'grace was the @entity89 , which contributed to soaring oil prices			0
money that used to be spent on @entity93 goods now got diverted abroad			1
the @entity46 took seriously its responsibility to keep the economy going			1
it did this by replacing the tech bubble with a new bubble , a housing bubble			1
household savings plummeted to zero , to the lowest level since the @entity102			0
it managed to sustain the economy , but the way it did it was shortsighted : @entity93 was living on borrowed money and borrowed time			1
finally , at the center of blame must be the financial institutions themselves			0
they -- and even more their executives -- had incentives that were not well aligned with the needs of our economy and our society			1
they were amply rewarded , presumably for managing risk and allocating capital , which was supposed to improve the efficiency of the economy so much that it justified their generous compensation			0
but they misallocated capital ; they mismanaged risk -- they created risk			0
they did what their incentive structures were designed to do : focusing on short - term profits and encouraging excessive risk - taking			1
this is not the first crisis in our financial system , not the first time that those who believe in free and unregulated markets have come running to the government for bail - outs			2
there is a pattern here , one that suggests deep systemic problems -- and a variety of solutions : 1			0
we need first to correct incentives for executives , reducing the scope for conflicts of interest and improving shareholder information about dilution in share value as a result of stock options			2
we should mitigate the incentives for excessive risk - taking and the short - term focus that has so long prevailed , for instance , by requiring bonuses to be paid on the basis of , say , five - year returns , rather than annual returns			1
secondly , we need to create a financial product safety commission , to make sure that products bought and sold by banks , pension funds , etc. are safe for " human consumption			0
" consenting adults should be given great freedom to do whatever they want , but that does not mean they should gamble with other people 's money			2
some may worry that this may stifle innovation			0
but that may be a good thing considering the kind of innovation we had -- attempting to subvert accounting and regulations			0
what we need is more innovation addressing the needs of ordinary @entity93 , so they can stay in their homes when economic conditions change			0
we need to create a financial systems stability commission to take an overview of the entire financial system , recognizing the interrelations among the various parts , and to prevent the excessive systemic leveraging that we have just experienced			2
we need to impose other regulations to improve the safety and soundness of our financial system , such as " speed bumps " to limit borrowing			2
historically , rapid expansion of lending has been responsible for a large fraction of crises and this crisis is no exception			2
we need better consumer protection laws , including laws that prevent predatory lending			2
we need better competition laws			0
the financial institutions have been able to prey on consumers through credit cards partly because of the absence of competition			0
but even more importantly , we should not be in situations where a firm is " too big to fail			0
" if it is that big , it should be broken up			0
these reforms will not guarantee that we will not have another crisis			0
the ingenuity of those in the financial markets is impressive			0
eventually , they will figure out how to circumvent whatever regulations are imposed			0
but these reforms will make another crisis of this kind less likely , and , should it occur , make it less severe than it otherwise would be			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0
