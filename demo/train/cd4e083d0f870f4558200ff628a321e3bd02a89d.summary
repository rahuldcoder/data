-- it was supposed to have been over in a few days			2
world powers would go in with fighter jets and the world 's most sophisticated precision - guided weapons to render @entity7 leader @entity6 powerless			1
but that 's not the way things happened			2
as @entity13 's airstrikes crossed the 100 - day mark , analysts blamed a host of faulty assumptions , including success based solely on surgical airstrikes , for a protracted war that some fear could drag on for more months			1
" it 's absolutely wrong to think that an air campaign can win this , " said @entity21 of the @entity22 and director of @entity24 , a @entity25 - based agency specializing in security issues related to the @entity28 world			1
the basic problem , @entity21 said , stemmed from presuppositions about the fortitude of the @entity7 opposition			1
buoyed by the successful uprisings to the east in @entity39 and to the west in @entity41 , @entity7 rebels believed they had the mettle to bring down @entity6			1
western powers believed that with a little help , @entity7 could be freed from totalitarian rule			1
but rebels launched an armed insurrection against a man who had spent four long decades preparing his state for unforeseen challenges			2
this was n't a peaceful revolution of the masses against a government that had no public support			2
" this revolt never really had the strength to succeed , " @entity21 said			2
" there was this feeling among the rebels that all we have to do is show up			0
but you should take a couple of years to get it organized first			0
if you 're just going to run out on the streets , the results will be predictable			0
" four months on , the rebels are not capable of supporting themselves , @entity21 said			2
they are out of fuel , oil production has shut down , and they have few available resources			0
they will soon face even shortages of food and water , @entity21 said			0
president @entity75 faces pressure at home to withdraw @entity79 forces			0
there is debate , too , in @entity82 over the expensive air campaign			2
the war may have been morally right , but @entity13 , said @entity21 , is facing a conundrum			2
part of that failure was a lack of consideration of the makeup of the @entity7 population , said @entity93 political scientist @entity92 , author of " the limits of @entity95			1
" " the fundamental error by the @entity97 and @entity13 was to imagine that the @entity7 people were united in opposition to @entity6 , " he said			1
" in reality , @entity7 is divided along lines of clan and tribe , some of whom benefit greatly from @entity6 , and therefore defend him fiercely , " he said			1
" any expert on ethnic conflict and intervention could have told the @entity97 that ahead of time			0
" in that respect , said @entity111 , director of the @entity112 , the @entity7 war has the potential for fallout that is worse than what happened after president @entity117 declared " mission accomplished " weeks after @entity119 's 2003 ouster in the @entity121 war			1
" to imagine that @entity7 are going to come together -- is a hope , but not a plan , " @entity111 said			1
" it was a mistake to get involved in such a feckless way			0
" behind the rhetorical rallying cry of protecting civilians , @entity111 said , has always been the real aim of @entity13 -- to kill @entity6			0
" if you made me bet my mortgage at gunpoint , i 'd say we probably will get @entity6 , " he said			0
but the question is when			0
and if it does n't happen in a timely fashion , then @entity13 risks the erosion of public support for its campaign , @entity111 said			0
" in some sense , 100 days is a short period of time , " he said			0
" but when your political support is so tenuous and thin , and when your operations have heretofore been ineffective in achieving campaign goals , then taking ground forces off the table has not made the war any shorter or any less bloody			1
" the @entity7 regime has also proven itself to be more robust and resilient than anyone imagined			1
it would be a mistake , said @entity111 , to assume that killing @entity6 would mean a collapse of the entire system			0
the @entity7 conflict has sometimes been compared to @entity13 's air war in the @entity157 in the 1990s			1
many people thought the @entity159 would go down instantly once @entity13 began bombing			0
and eventually , it was the threat of a ground invasion that led to the capitulation of then - @entity165 president @entity164			1
@entity6 , however , faces no such threat			0
and some believe the arrest warrant issued by the @entity169 this week will only help strengthen his resolve to stay in power			0
" if @entity75 had thought a hundred days ago that he would be where he is now , you have to wonder whether he would have made the same decision , " @entity111 said			0
" how can you tell the @entity79 people we 're going to start jumping over the fence and we have no idea where we are going to come down ? " but not everyone is pessimistic about prospects in @entity7			1
@entity181 , for one , stands by his belief that the @entity7 opposition can defeat @entity6			1
the rebels , he said , have made noticeable gains with the support of @entity13 air power			2
he cited recent rebel takeovers of western towns in the @entity190 and said @entity6 is more isolated now than ever before			0
" the @entity7 people are capable of fighting this fight , " said @entity181 , an analyst at the @entity191			1
" the consequences of this , even though it is more painful and brutal , will have a positive outcome in the end			2
" it has not been easy for @entity181 to watch the conflict unfold in @entity7			1
but he is a strong proponent for self - determination who feels strongly that the @entity7 people , not outside forces , must determine their fate			1
" i warned against this from the start , that @entity7 public opinion would not like it , " he said , referring to the possibility of foreign boots on the ground			1
and @entity181 still questions the motivation of western powers and the agendas of exiles who he fears may want to exploit oil - rich @entity7			1
" i 'm optimistic but guarded , " he said			0
@entity181 said the bad news is that @entity13 lacked clarity in its mission and also in a negotiated exit for @entity6 , which he said is more difficult now because of the arrest warrant for alleged crimes against humanity			0
still , @entity6 's regime will fall , he said			0
then the real battle for the future of @entity7 will just be starting .			2

an air war alone is not enough , say some analysts
but without ground troops , what is the end game ?
some fear a protracted war that could go on for months
a @entity7 analyst says self - determination is key
