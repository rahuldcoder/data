@entity0 , @entity1 -- the midterm campaigns will soon be under way			0
president @entity5 has a few more months in the hot days of summer to get legislation through @entity7 , but representatives and senators will soon be focused on their campaigns with little thought for anything else			1
the midterm elections will be extraordinarily important for the composition of @entity7			1
if @entity15 can expand their numbers in the @entity17 and @entity18 , they might develop enough muscle to stifle @entity5 from accomplishing anything else			1
it could also be enough to put pressure on moderate @entity23 to further undercut the legislative gains of the first term by enacting spending cuts and weakening the regulatory apparatus of programs like @entity29			1
on the other hand , if @entity23 do well they can improve their standing in the @entity17 and place more pressure on republicans to make compromises			1
besides the composition of @entity7 , the midterms will provide some insight into the challenges each party will face and what promises they might make in the 2016 presidential election			1
the shape of the campaigns will start to clarify what the @entity15 intend to stand for and whether they can put forth ideas that excite , rather than turn off , voters outside the reddest parts of the country			2
the rebellion taking place within the @entity15 has been growing more intense			2
many senior leaders are warning that their party is on a destructive path that will only lead to more rounds of defeat			0
many @entity15 privately agreed when former senate majority leader @entity56 said the @entity15 ought to be " closed for repairs " until next year , and in the meantime , " spend that time going over ideas and positive agenda			2
" since 2010 , @entity15 invested almost everything in the issue of deficit reduction and saying no to everything that came out of the @entity17			2
the bet has n't been paying off			0
at a certain point , voters seem to have lost interest in the message and , now that the long - term budget picture is doing much better while the economics of austerity has come under fire , the issue is gaining even less voter traction			0
the midterm elections will be the opportunity in the next two years for republicans to show voters they have something more to say , and to offer two or three big ideas they can use in the race for the @entity17			1
@entity23 face a similar challenge			2
they need to start hinting at what their party will be about in the post-obama age			0
many democrats are wondering if the next election will be like 1988 , when vice president @entity89 campaigned on @entity91 's record and essentially promised to do more of the same , just in kinder and gentler fashion			0
or will @entity23 try to offer something more transformative -- a governing agenda for the challenges we face in 2016 rather than those we faced in 2008 ? voters want to hear what @entity23 have to say about federal investments in the nation 's economic future , about how to handle climate change and how to build on @entity5 's promise to restore the balance between law and civil liberties and homeland security			1
if @entity23 can start developing ideas for the next candidate to run on , they could not only bolster their numbers on the @entity112 but strengthen the platform for the next crop of candidates to win over voters			1
there are also questions about the mood of the electorate			0
everyone will have a close eye on the immigrant vote			0
although the turnout is much smaller in midterm elections , given the heat of the immigration debates , it will be significant to see if the energy levels are still high among immigrants for the @entity23 and how much @entity15 have been able to improve their standing with some high - profile party members like @entity133 coming out for reform			1
it will also be important to see whether any kind of anti-immigrant backlash sets in , similar to what @entity23 saw against civil rights in 1966 following the race riots in @entity141 and other cities			2
the outcome of the debate over immigration legislation in the @entity17 will have a big effect			0
the aftermath of the recent controversies will also be significant			0
right now the political cycle is in full scandal swing			0
the midterms will provide some sense of whether those stories have legs , either detrimentally for @entity23 as @entity15 suffered in 1974 after @entity155 or whether a backlash sets in against the @entity15 , as @entity157 and his allies suffered in 1998 amid the impeachment of president @entity160			1
finally , the midterms will offer a platform for future presidential candidates to show their stuff			1
in 1966 , former vice president @entity165 seized the national spotlight , campaigning for republicans across the nation , and making it clear , through his fundraising and speeches that he was a formidable candidate who could take on @entity172 , or any other @entity173			0
this year , candidates from former secretary of state @entity175 to @entity1 gov. @entity176 will seek to use this moment , with the national spotlight turned on the political playing field , for the same advantage			0
it will also be a chance for the parties to shake off some of the challenges that are holding them down , such as the right - wing drift of the @entity15 -- which could hurt the chances of the @entity15 candidates in 2016 , regardless of how charismatic and talented they are			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity190 .			0

@entity190 : midterm elections could change the balance of power in @entity7
@entity190 : if @entity23 win , they can force compromise ; if @entity15 wins , it can *torpedo* @entity5
he says midterms will be a *glimpse* at challenges and promises parties will offer in 2016
@entity190 : elections will also offer a huge stage for possible presidential candidates
