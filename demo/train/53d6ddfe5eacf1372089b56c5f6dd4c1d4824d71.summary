-- in the game of chess , one woman has dominated all others for more than 20 years			2
@entity5 has defeated nine world champions including @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , and is the only female ever to join an exclusive coterie of players rated above 2700 by the @entity13			1
although she is the only woman ranked among the @entity13 's @entity15 , @entity14 has never won the @entity16			1
by 14 , she had so outstripped her female peers that she ceased competing in women 's tournaments			1
" i have no problem with other women , " she said , " but if i had played against ladies there would be a huge gap between the two of us			2
" " i played against men because it was challenging , it was interesting , and i felt i could improve the fastest and the best ( against them )			0
it 's very important to know what your aims and ambitions are			2
" in chess , women 's tournaments are only open to females , but women may compete in tournaments for men			1
it was @entity5 's older sister @entity43 who broke this gender barrier , becoming the first woman to qualify for the men 's world championship in 1986 , and the first woman to earn a men 's grandmaster title in 1991			1
younger sister , @entity52 , is an @entity53 , too			0
the family 's success ignited an ongoing debate about whether genius is born or created , the sexual politics of professional sport , and the value of mixed gender competition			1
after @entity5 became a mother in 2004 , she posed another challenge to the establishment : she did n't retire			1
currently ranked 44th in the world with a rating of 2698 , and a mother of two , @entity14 is competing at the @entity68 , which begins in @entity69 this week , and in the @entity70 in december			2
hothoused in chess by the time she was five , @entity5 could beat her father at chess			1
she and her sisters were home schooled as part of an educational experiment by their father , @entity78 , who believed any child could excel at an early age if given the right schooling			2
besides learning @entity84 , they were hothoused in the game of chess			2
more from leading women : late comic @entity88 's funniest gags @entity5 played her first international tournament aged nine , winning the @entity90			1
" it was a special feeling , you can imagine , for a nine - year - old girl to beat an adult , or even to be in competition , " she said			0
aged 11 , she beat her first grandmaster , and became one herself in 1991 , at the age of 15 -- relieving @entity99 @entity98 of his record as the youngest - ever grandmaster			1
@entity5 's father firmly believed that , since chess is a purely mental competition , women ought to be able to perform at the same level as men			1
by the time she was 14 , @entity5 had so outstripped her female peers that she saw little point in competing in women 's tournaments			1
" i played against men most of my life because our goal was that i wanted to reach the highest potential to be an absolute world champion , " she said			0
" there was a very big difference , even bigger than now , between the best male and the best female players in chess			1
" my father believed that the higher you put your goal , the higher you reach			0
that was the main reason me and my sisters were playing mostly against male competitors			0
" tigress at the board it might not have been @entity133 's explicit intention to challenge male domination in chess -- but a challenge was nevertheless perceived			1
media attention focused heavily on the spectacle of a young girl competing against men sometimes four decades her senior			0
more from leading women : the brains behind the most viral ad ever no great chess player ever likes to lose , but losing to a girl was seen as particularly humiliating			1
when @entity5 won the boys under 14 section of the @entity149 in 1990 , one columnist wrote approvingly that it was easy to forget that @entity5 was " just a girl			1
" but by 2001 , the @entity151 reported that , " in the highly masculine world of top - level chess , it is no disgrace to lose to @entity5 ... in person , miss @entity5 gives no hint that she is a tigress at the chessboard			1
she is soft - spoken , modest and very feminine ... " today , @entity5 says that , if it was strange for chess pundits to see a young girl catapulted to the top , it was strange for her too			1
" there was a point when it was a bit much for me , and i could n't handle the journalists ' questions and all the fuss about my results ... i had to realize that i was a role model for other girls and their parents -- they wanted them to follow in my footsteps			0
but i focused on chess , " @entity5 said			1
" i did n't think about other things			0
" in 2002 , @entity14 finally defeated @entity7 , who had previously described her as " talented but not greatly talented , '' explaining that " women by their nature are not exceptional chess players ... not great fighters , " in a 1990 interview with the @entity151			1
but in a game @entity5 described as " one of the most remarkable moments " of her career , she won in 42 moves			1
@entity7 later credited the @entity188 ' career success in a chapter on anti-complacency tactics in his book , " how @entity192			0
" " by seeking out and often besting the toughest competition , " he wrote , " the @entity188 showed that there are no inherent limitations to their aptitude -- an idea that many male players refused to accept until they had unceremoniously been crushed by a twelve - year - old with a ponytail			2
" in 2003 , @entity14 enjoyed one of her best results			0
at a tournament in the @entity205 , she finished half a point behind current world champion @entity9 , a point ahead of @entity208 ( who @entity133 has yet to beat ) , and beat @entity210			0
the following year , her son @entity211 was born , and she took time out from chess			2
in 2005 , she competed in two tournaments which brought her to her highest spot on the rankings board -- world number eight			0
things fall apart " being professional means 100 % is not enough , " she said			2
" number one , two and three in my life was chess			2
the reality for women is , when a child comes into the picture , priorities change			2
" more from leading women : at last , it 's @entity228 's time to shine after her daughter was born in 2006 , @entity5 says , " things in my career dropped , pretty much			1
not only my rating points but i was not happy with the way i was playing			0
" her ranking dropped from 10th to 50th in the world and in 2008 she finished last in the @entity236			0
" everything really kind of fell apart , " she told @entity237 , " even though i have had help with my children from day one from grandparents and nannies			0
" first of all , my priorities in life and in my mind definitely changed			0
i did n't have the same interest in chess as i had before			0
" as she reveals in an upcoming book , " how i beat @entity251 " it was n't until she played an opening gambit that had been a childhood favorite ( the @entity254 ) against the eventual winner of the @entity256 , that she felt like devoting herself to chess again			0
" it felt like for a moment the @entity5 from 1988 , who many ( including myself ) had forgotten , had come back to deliver her trademark brilliancies , " she wrote			2
@entity5 has decided to continue with her professional career despite the juggling she now has to do			1
" i 'm a maximalist and i like to do things in a maximal way , " she said			0
" it 's extremely difficult to admit to myself that maybe i can not , because there are too many fields in my life that i 'm covering : being a mother , being a wife , being a professional player , coordinating chess events and writing books			1
" ( but ) i started to play chess when i was five and ever since , i liked the game			0
and after all , i can still do things which give me a lot of pleasure			0
" " when i got married , many of my colleagues thought my life was going to go in a different direction and i probably would n't care about my game anymore			0
actually , it was the contrary			0
somehow i became more balanced and my life became more complete			0

@entity5 became the youngest ever grandmaster at 15 , taking title from @entity98
she is the only women ranked in @entity13 's top 100 players
birth of first child forced @entity5 to *reassess* : " everything really fell apart "
now she balances professional chess with writing , motherhood and marriage
