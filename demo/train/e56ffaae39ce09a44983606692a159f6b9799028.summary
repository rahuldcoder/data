-- federal agents have backed up @entity2 captive @entity4 's confession in the killing of journalist @entity6 by using photographs of the veins in his hands , according to a new report released thursday			1
@entity4 confessed to beheading @entity12 after his 2003 arrest in @entity14			2
but the @entity16 admission that he had been subjected to " waterboarding " -- a practice historically treated as torture -- while in @entity18 custody cast doubt on the reliability of his confession , according to a lengthy investigation of the @entity12 case by the @entity24			2
according to the report , the @entity28 and @entity18 used stills from the video of @entity12 's killing to match the patterns of the veins in @entity4 's hand in 2004 and repeated the process in 2007 , after @entity4 repeated his confession during a hearing at the @entity16 prison camp at @entity39 , @entity40			1
" beyond @entity4 's confession , the @entity16 government has never revealed any corroborating evidence , " the report states			2
but it called the vein match the " best evidence " the @entity16 has linking @entity4 to @entity12 's 2002 slaying			1
the @entity28 had no comment on the report that it used vein - matching technology to confirm @entity4 's identity , and said in a written statement that it is not using the technology " at this time			1
" @entity4 is accused of planning @entity2 's september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity57 and @entity58			2
according to military prosecutors , he admitted responsibility for the attacks " from @entity64 " during a hearing before a military court at @entity39			0
he has not been charged in @entity12 's death , however			1
according to the report , @entity16 officials decided against bringing charges in the @entity12 case to avoid complicating @entity4 's prosecution for the 9/11 attacks			1
@entity12 was kidnapped in the @entity14 city of @entity73 while on his way to what he believed was an interview with a radical cleric connected to @entity2 operative @entity79 's " shoe bomb " plot			0
a video of @entity12 's beheading was distributed online nearly a month after he was abducted , but the face of the killer who slit his throat was not visible			1
according to thursday 's report , his captors were " inept , plagued by bungling plans , a failure to cover their tracks , and an inability to operate cameras and computer equipment			0
" even the grisly video of @entity12 's death had to be restaged , " because the cameraman failed to capture the original scene			1
" @entity4 moved so quickly to cut @entity12 's throat that the photographer failed to load a tape into his camera , according to the report			1
he repeated the killing for the camera , severing @entity12 's head in the process and making sure the photographer showed the blood still pouring through @entity12 's throat			1
the scene " would later turn the stomachs of even the most hardened @entity14 and @entity16 investigators , " the report states			0
but the report is also critical of @entity14 authorities ' pursuit of the killers			0
prosecutors " knowingly used perjured testimony " against the four men who were convicted in @entity12 's death , it states			1
" while the four were involved in the kidnapping plan and certainly were culpable , they were not present when @entity12 was murdered			0
others , who were present and actually assisted in the brutal beheading , were not charged , " the report states			0
and 14 people suspected of working as guards , " fixers " or drivers in the abduction remain free , the report states			0
at least five others suspected of involvement have been killed or died under suspicious circumstances , according to the report			0
@entity4 and one of his nephews remain in @entity16 custody , another man is being held in @entity14 on unrelated charges and another of @entity4 's nephews is believed to be in custody , " but his whereabouts can not be confirmed			0
" @entity4 told the @entity28 that a senior @entity2 operative advised him to take control of @entity12 from his original kidnappers , the report said			2
@entity14 authorities freed a guard who was a key informant and failed to follow potential leads , according to the report			0
the three - year @entity152 was prepared by faculty and students at @entity155 in @entity58			2
@entity0 's @entity156 contributed to this report			0

officials used ' vein - matching ' to tie @entity4 to @entity12 's killing , report says
@entity4 has said he killed the journalist , but has not been charged
the report is a result of a three - year investigation
