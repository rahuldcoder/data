-- on tuesday , the state of @entity2 , the birthplace of the @entity4 and the nation 's organized labor movement , became the country 's 24th right - to - work state			1
@entity2 joins @entity9 , which passed right - to - work legislation in february , to become the second right - to - work state in the heavily unionized @entity12			1
the legislation marks a monumental shift away from union power to " open shop " free labor			0
right - to - work laws prohibit workers from being forced to contribute mandatory dues to labor unions in order to gain employment , regardless of whether or not they are members of a union , and prohibit employers from firing workers if they do n't join a union			1
with workers no longer obligated to pay union dues , union membership , revenue , and strength decline			1
predictably , there was no shortage of outrage from union workers this week as they stormed the capital building in @entity39 to protest			0
teachers walked out of schools and @entity43 state senators even walked out on the final vote to approve the initial bills			0
@entity47 workers and their @entity43 allies realize that the transition from a " closed shop " state to a right - to - work state is the second in near fatal blows to @entity2 's entrenched union interests			1
the first blow came this past november when unions spent tens of millions of dollars in @entity2 pushing proposal 2 , a ballot initiative that would have written collective bargaining into the state constitution and in essence outlawed a right - to - work law and limits on union power			1
@entity2 voters defeated the proposal 58 % to 42 %			0
proposal 2 was defeated because the unions had overreached their hand			0
decades ago , unions were important to workers because @entity72 's emerging labor markets were less predictable and less safe			0
but much of the @entity72 public now realizes that labor unions are no longer needed in the way they once were , and they do n't need to be enshrined in state constitutions			0
what 's the ' right - to - work ' battle all about ? what 's more , many unions have deviated from their original purpose and warped into powerful special interests rather than true representatives of workers ' rights			1
there is a growing public consensus , seen most recently in @entity89 , @entity9 and now @entity2 , that non-right - to - work states can stifle private labor competition and give too much power , politically and financially , to the unions			1
what right - to - work states have found is that , if given the choice , some , or even many , workers will chose not to join the union			2
in other words , many workers themselves no longer see the need for mandatory dues and labor union representation			2
on monday , president @entity106 pushed back and blasted right - to - work laws during a visit to @entity2			2
he said , " these so called right to work laws , they do n't have to do with economics -- they have everything to do with politics			0
what they 're really doing is trying to talk about the right to work for less money			0
" video : ' unions are the problem ' despite the protests by the labor unions and their @entity43 allies , it should be noted that @entity2 's legislation does not end collective bargaining nor does it increase pension contributions or health care benefit payments from union workers			1
and contrary to president @entity106 's thinking , right - to - work laws are directly related to economics			2
right - to - work laws give employers the freedom to hire non-union workers and negotiate contracts with more than one party			2
for this reason , right - to - work states are more attractive to private business than non-right - to - work , and could increase private - sector wages			2
for example , on @entity146 's annual list of the best states for business , nine of the top 10 states are right - to - work states			0
it 's no coincidence that foreign automobile manufacturers often build new plants in right - to - work states like @entity154 and @entity155 , rather than @entity156 -- the " @entity156			2
" analysis : why @entity72 's unions are losing power perhaps @entity2 's new right - to - work status will unlock employers from burdensome union contracts and attract new private enterprise to @entity156 , which is predicted to go bankrupt by the end of this year			1
after all , gov. @entity166 's union reforms in neighboring @entity89 helped eliminate the state 's budget shortfall			0
twenty , 10 , or even five years ago , few people would have predicted that @entity2 would become a right - to - work state			1
adding @entity2 to the expanding list of right - to - work states only hastens to a close the days of labor union monopolies over state governement and businesses			1
could @entity177 , @entity178 , or @entity179 be next ? the question does n't seem so farfetched now			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity183 .			0

on tuesday , @entity2 became the country 's 24th right - to - work state

he says with workers no longer obligated to pay dues , union strength declines
