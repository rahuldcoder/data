-- " excuse me , " the woman called			2
" is the president still speaking ? " " i think so , " i called over to her			2
she let her face scrunch up into an expression of mild dismay			2
it had nothing at all to do with politics			2
this was in central @entity12 ; she was standing next to a furniture - delivery truck near the intersection of two streets called @entity17 and @entity18			1
president @entity19 was addressing a rally on the campus of @entity22 in @entity23 , a few blocks away			2
people attending the event had jammed the residential neighborhood with their parked cars , and some of those cars were so close to her driveway , on @entity32 , that the furniture truck could not maneuver into it			1
" i had this delivery scheduled , but i did n't know it would be the same time the president was here , " she said , her voice pleasant			2
" the guys from the truck are looking for another way to get it to my house			2
i told them i 'd stand here and guard the furniture			0
" @entity12 is getting plenty of visits from the candidates			1
during the time i was in the middle of @entity12 this summer , @entity50 was in the area twice , @entity55 was there at least once , and on this early afternoon @entity19 had made his way to @entity22			1
scenes like this repeat every four years ; there are days in highly contested states when something seems almost amiss if you do n't encounter a motorcade or a police escort			0
they are traveling salesmen , the candidates are ; they hit the road bearing their products -- the products being themselves			1
and although presidential and vice presidential candidates are the most celebrated politicians in the land , they become not so different from the thousands of other sales reps who lug their sample cases across @entity77 every work week of the year			1
@entity79 : harsh realities for @entity81 and the people in the towns -- especially in the swing states -- find out what it 's like to be suddenly wanted , to be the recipient of exceptionally fervid sales ardor			0
when you are in the market for a big - ticket item -- a house ; a new car -- you notice how accommodating the real - estate agent or the car dealership is toward you : always checking back , asking what they can do to win your business , generally being constantly around and ever available			0
after you 've bought the item , they tend not to come calling			0
that 's how it is during that small sliver of time when the people running for president and vice president ca n't do enough for the potential voters			0
for those voters in the states that can tip the balance of an election , it can be flattering -- and also a little wearying -- to be so relentlessly courted , even while knowing that the courtship has a hard expiration date in early november			1
@entity116 : @entity81 fix their enthusiasm gap the candidates , however low on sleep and tugged in all directions , travel great distances to try to make the sale			0
despite the much - vaunted reach of television commercials and social networks , they understand that , to close the deal , they had better be there in person , just like the real - estate agent or the car dealer			1
because if they are n't , they know that the other real - estate agent or car dealer will be			0
to watch the major - party candidates move through the country in these months ... well , for all their fame , there 's more than a bit of literature 's most unforgettable salesman , @entity143 , present : " a man way out there in the blue , riding on a smile and a shoeshine			1
" on the day @entity19 spoke on the campus lawn at @entity22 , the @entity150 and the local police had closed down @entity152 to traffic , but allowed pedestrians to slip around the barricade if they wanted to give the pizzeria one door down a little business			0
a local man walking with a cane , running for an office considerably less lofty than president or vice president , stopped at each of the outdoor tables and handed a leaflet to each pizza - eater , saying : " i 'd like your vote this fall			0
i 'm on the ballot			0
" in less than nine weeks , two of the four men crisscrossing the nation -- @entity19 , @entity55 , @entity50 , @entity174 -- are going to find out that they failed to make the sale after all , and two of the men are going to find out that they have successfully culminated the transaction			0
the nervous uncertainty of that is what can make their high - level pursuit at times feel utterly life - sized			0
@entity188 , in that same play in which he introduced @entity143 to the world , understood the compulsion behind all of this quite well : " a salesman is got to dream , boy			1
it comes with the territory			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			1

@entity195 was in @entity12 this summer , where presidential candidate visits were constant
he says they are like traveling salesmen who must show up if they want to close the deal
he says @entity204 get weary of the courting , even though they know it ends in november
@entity195 : they *'re* like @entity143 : " a salesman is got to dream , boy . it comes with the territory "
