@entity0 -- the @entity2 on tuesday weighed in on one of the most explosive issues in @entity6 politics , filing a lawsuit to overturn a tough new @entity9 immigration law that has sharply divided people along partisan , ideological and ethnic lines			1
it also asked the federal courts to grant an injunction to stop enforcement of the measure before it takes effect late this month			0
@entity9 's law requires immigrants to carry their alien registration documents at all times and allows police to question the residency status of people in the course of enforcing another law			1
it also targets businesses that hire illegal immigrant laborers or knowingly transport them			0
@entity2 lawyers argued that the state statute should be declared invalid because it has improperly preempted federal law			1
" in our constitutional system , the power to regulate immigration is exclusively vested in the federal government , " the brief said			1
" the immigration framework set forth by @entity39 and administered by federal agencies reflects a careful and considered balance of national law enforcement , foreign relations , and humanitarian concerns -- concerns that belong to the nation as a whole , not a single state			2
" how do you feel about the @entity9 immigration law ? however , @entity9 gov. @entity51 said it was " wrong that our own federal government is suing the people of @entity9 for helping to enforce federal immigration law			1
" " today 's filing is nothing more than a massive waste of taxpayer funds , " @entity51 said in a statement			0
" these funds could be better used against the violent @entity64 cartels than the people of @entity9			2
" the government 's brief said the @entity6 @entity72 and federal law " do not permit the development of a patchwork of state and local immigration policies throughout the country			1
" " although a state may adopt regulations that have an indirect or incidental effect on aliens , a state may not establish its own immigration policy or enforce state laws in a manner that interferes with federal immigration law , " the brief said			1
" @entity84 of @entity9 has crossed this constitutional line			2
" the brief contends that the @entity9 law " disrupts federal enforcement priorities and resources that focus on aliens who pose a threat to national security or public safety			1
... if allowed to go into effect , [ its ] mandatory enforcement scheme will conflict with and undermine the federal government 's careful balance of immigration enforcement priorities and objectives			2
" the @entity2 highlighted statements in support of the lawsuit from the sheriff of @entity9 's @entity104 and several @entity106 officials , among others			1
president @entity108 said in a speech july 1 that the @entity9 measure has " fanned the flames of an already contentious debate			0
" among other things , it puts pressure on police officers to enforce rules that are " unenforceable " while making communities less safe -- in part , by making people more reluctant to report crimes , he said			0
the law also has " the potential of violating the rights of innocent @entity6 citizens and legal residents , making them subject to possible stops or questioning because of what they look like or how they sound			2
" @entity9 's two @entity130 senators , however , immediately blasted the decision to file the lawsuit			1
" the @entity6 people must wonder whether the @entity108 administration is really committed to securing the border when it sues a state that is simply trying to protect its people by enforcing immigration law , " sens. @entity133 and @entity134 said in a statement			1
the top @entity130 on the @entity142 also ripped the decision			0
" not only does this lawsuit reveal the @entity108 administration 's contempt for immigration laws and the people of @entity9 , it reveals contempt for the majority of the @entity6 people who support @entity9 's efforts to reduce human smuggling , drug trafficking and illegal immigration , " said rep. @entity144 , @entity145			1
" @entity9 's law simply applies state penalties to acts already illegal under federal law			1
" rep. @entity162 , @entity9 , released a statement calling the lawsuit a " sideshow			2
" " a court battle between the federal government and @entity9 will not move us closer to securing the border or fixing @entity6 's broken immigration system , " she said			1
@entity51 , a @entity130 , said the @entity9 law was designed " to complement , not supplant , enforcement of federal immigration laws , " and that she would fight the government lawsuit with the help of a legal defense fund set up to pay the legal fees			1
" our laws will be found to be constitutional -- because that is exactly what they are , " @entity51 's statement said			0
@entity108 renewed his push for comprehensive immigration reform last week , calling for bipartisan cooperation on an issue reflecting deep social and political divisions			0
seeking an elusive middle ground on the subject , the president highlighted the importance of immigrants to @entity6 history and progress while acknowledging the fear and frustration many feel with a system that he said seems " fundamentally broken			0
" he asserted that the majority of @entity6 are ready to embrace reform legislation that would help resolve the status of an estimated 11 million illegal immigrants			0
in his july 1 speech , @entity108 warned that rounding up everyone in the country who has entered illegally would be both " logistically impossible " and " tear at the fabric of the nation			0
" at the same time , the president indicated it would be wrong to offer blanket amnesty for people who came into the @entity6 unlawfully			2
despite @entity108 's call for bipartisan immigration reform , several senior @entity215 sources said last week they see virtually no chance of @entity39 taking up such a measure before november 's midterm elections			0
a @entity222 national poll conducted in late may showed 57 percent of @entity6 backing the @entity9 law , with 37 percent opposed to it			1
the poll also indicated that public support for beefing up security along the @entity6 border with @entity64 has grown significantly			0
according to the survey , nearly nine out of 10 @entity6 want to increase @entity6 law enforcement along the border with @entity64			2
eight in 10 questioned also supported a program that would allow illegal immigrants already in the @entity6 to stay here and apply for legal residency , provided they had a job and paid back taxes			0
but only 38 percent say that program should be a higher priority than border security and other get - tough proposals			0
six in 10 said border security was the higher priority			0
@entity1 's @entity245 , @entity246 and @entity247 contributed to this report			0
