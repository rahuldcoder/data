@entity0 -- the @entity2 of @entity3 , @entity4 , is scheduled to vote late wednesday on a resolution formally authorizing the filing of bankruptcy			1
the council , scheduled to meet at 5 p.m. , is to consider first another resolution declaring a fiscal emergency			1
last week , interim city manager @entity11 and finance director @entity12 issued a report stating that the city was facing insolvency and its expenditures are projected to exceed revenues by $ 45 million			1
the city 's general fund reserves had been as high as $ 19 million in 2001 but are now depleted , the report said			1
some $ 10 million to $ 16 million in annual revenue has evaporated in recent years as taxable sales dried up and property values plummeted in the city of 211,000 residents , the report said			1
@entity3 is about 60 miles east of downtown @entity0			2
prior agreements reducing city salaries are now ending , " creating an increase in salaries and benefits of $ 10 million effective july 1 , 2012 , and increased costs in future years as merit increases resume , " the report said			1
despite negotiating tens of millions of dollars in concessions and reducing its work force by 20 % over the past four years , @entity3 would not have enough cash on hand to meet its obligations , according to the report			1
" the city has reached a breaking point , " the report said			0
opinion : can state governments step up ? @entity3 would be the third @entity4 city to file for bankruptcy in the past few weeks			1
many municipalities in the @entity4 and around the nation are struggling to cover their costs as the economic malaise continues to hurt tax revenue streams , experts said			2
this will lead to more municipal bankruptcies , which have been rare until now			0
" this is not the end			0
this is the beginning , " @entity58 , business professor at @entity59 , told @entity1 recently			0

" the town of @entity66 , @entity4 , sought protection july 2 after a property developer won a $ 43 million court judgment against the resort town of just over 8,000 residents			1
experts say this filing should not be lumped in with the other two @entity4 towns since it was an unusual circumstance			2
the city of @entity76 , however , filed for bankruptcy in late june after three months of mediation with creditors failed to close a $ 26 million budget shortfall			1
the city of 292,000 residents had already addressed $ 90 million in deficits over the past three years , mainly through reducing services and employee compensation			2
both @entity76 's and @entity3 's fiscal troubles are due in large part to the massive housing downturn and recession that swept across @entity4			1
both towns were hit particularly hard by the foreclosure crisis , which left numerous abandoned homes and reduced property values in its wake			0
that led to lower property tax revenues , critical to supporting public services			0
also , municipalities have struggled from budget changes made on the state level			0
because of massive budget shortfalls , gov. @entity101 and the state legislature made changes to vehicle tax money allocation and redevelopment agencies that stripped locales of hundreds of millions in state funding			0
governor signs high - speed rail bill while some areas of the @entity4 are starting to recover , the regions containing those two towns are not , said @entity114 , executive director of the @entity115			2
by filing for bankruptcy , cities will be able to keep police and firefighters on the street and possibly keep some parks and libraries open while they work out their finances , he said			0
