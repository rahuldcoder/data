editor 's note : @entity2 is the assignment manager for the @entity5 unit			1
she has been a type i diabetic for 40 years			1
this is her story of life with diabetes			1
@entity2 uses a pump attached to a catheter in her body to monitor glucose levels and administer insulin			1
( @entity5 ) -- when i was 7 years old , my mom took me to the doctor because i had lost a lot of weight , despite a voracious appetite			1
my family had just moved from the @entity22 to @entity23 , @entity24 , and this visit to the doctor 's office was my introduction to a man who would come to have a huge impact on my life			2
his name was dr. @entity32 , and he was the pediatrician who diagnosed me with diabetes			1
he spoke to me directly , rather than to my mother , and he asked me questions : did i feel thirsty ? did i need to urinate during the night ? the answer to both questions was yes			2
he asked for a urine sample and the result was immediate			1
dr. @entity32 told me and my mother that my body was n't processing sugar properly			0
that is how my 40 - year journey with diabetes began			1
i was checked into a hospital to learn how to test my urine for sugar , give myself injections of insulin , follow a diabetic diet and control my diabetes			1
i spent several days in the hospital learning how to manage my disease , and then they sent me home			0
dr. @entity32 would call our house each afternoon to check on me and see how i was doing			0
much to my parents ' chagrin -- and to my delight -- he wanted me to be self sufficient and responsible for monitoring myself			0
i refused to let my parents give me injections or test my urine			1
this demand for self sufficiency turned out to be one of my best life lessons , and not just for managing my diabetes			1
while some diabetics may feel their disease is a burden , i feel that being diagnosed with diabetes was a blessing in disguise			1
it forced our family to eat healthily , and it taught me about good nutrition -- something i practice every day			0
i know carbohydrate counts in most foods , and i understand dietary concepts that most people do n't even care about			0
being active is also a way to burn off high blood sugar , so when my urine tested positive for glucose , my older sister @entity84 was in charge of exercising me			1
we had countless jump - rope contests , bike rides and roller - skating excursions , keeping me and my three sisters active and fit			0
and i felt like a little mad scientist , using a test tube with drops of water , urine and fizzy tablets to see if there was sugar in my urine			1
fortunately , over time , technology improved			1
first , test strips were developed that could be dipped in urine to reveal whether sugar was present in it			2
but the truth is , testing urine for sugar was a primitive method			1
by the time sugar gets into the urine , it 's a signal that the body does n't have enough insulin to process sugar			2
and the urine test did n't give an actual number for the amount of sugar in the urine			2
it simply gave a color reading that corresponded with a range of how much sugar was present in the urine			2
@entity117 was really an understatement when you talk about urine testing			1
home blood glucose testing kits became available in the early 1980s , and they were a huge move toward precise control and management of diabetes			1
with the kit , the diabetic uses a device to poke a finger and produce a drop of blood			2
the blood is placed on a test strip that fits into a device that produces a reading of the blood glucose within seconds			2
while i initially balked at the idea of pricking my finger several times a day , now i ca n't imagine not doing it in order to monitor what my blood sugar is doing			0
the 1980s also saw the advent of the insulin pump			0
this device is the size of a pager and contains a reservoir filled with insulin			0
the reservoir connects to a tube that infuses the insulin into the body with a tiny plastic shunt			0
so rather than taking multiple injections to mimic the body 's insulin patterns , the pump drips insulin into the body to keep blood sugars constant , then gives extra amounts with meals			0
another life - altering development in diabetes , which i have discovered in the last year , is the continuous glucose monitor , or cgm			1
this is a small device inserted into the tissue -- usually the abdomen , hip or leg -- and it has a tiny sensor that reads the glucose level of the body 's fluids			2
the data is transmitted to a receiver , and patients can see a constant reading of their blood sugar levels			0
i have participated in clinical trials for three different cgm devices , and i found them all to be quite accurate			0
some sensors transmit data directly to an insulin pump , so you can use the reading to adjust and fine - tune the amount of insulin being pumped into the body			0
the patient still has to test his or her blood sugar to confirm the sensor is properly calibrated , but it 's amazing to be able to see constant readings and graphs of what your blood sugar is doing and better manage blood sugars			0
cgm technology is a step toward the ultimate goal of controlling type i diabetes using what 's called a " closed loop system			1
" this means diabetics someday will be able to wear a pump that gathers data from a sensor so precise that the pump can be programmed to act on its own and make adjustments all by itself			0
the current systems are " open looped , " meaning the diabetic controls when the doses are given			2
the goal is to eventually create a pump that is more like a robotic delivery system , and all the patient has to do is wear it			0
once that technology is perfected , this type of device would be implanted , which would be the next best thing to not having diabetes			1
i mentioned to my sister @entity84 that i had tracked down dr. deputy for this article			0
she told me something i did n't know when i was 7			2
forty years ago , before the advent of all of the cool diabetes technology such as insulin pumps , continuous glucose monitors and blood sugar testing , parents were given a fairly grim prediction for how their child would fare			1
dr. @entity32 told my parents that i would probably only live to the age of 20 or 30 , which apparently -- but not surprisingly -- had the whole family freaked out			0
i spoke with dr. deputy , who recently retired from his pediatric practice , and he seemed to remember me			0
when i asked him about his dismal prognosis for my survival , he said sadly , " at that time , that was what we told parents back then			0
... everything changes with time -- diabetes , leukemia -- technology has changed with the pump and the equipment			1
" i think he was relieved that his prognosis was wrong			0
i know that i certainly am			0
in fact , i am hoping to live another 40 years ! e-mail to a friend			2

@entity5 medical unit assignment manager @entity2 is a type i diabetic
she learned she had diabetes when she was 7 years old
testing *progressed* from fizzy tablets in urine to continuous glucose monitors
with changes in technology have come improvements in prognoses
