-- on tuesday , voters across the country appeared to offer a rebuke to the administration of president @entity5 by voting into office many republicans , who now will control the @entity8 and the @entity9			1
such a take - down in the second year of the second term of any president is not uncommon			0
but this is the first @entity14 - @entity14 president , a man swept into office twice with huge support from blacks			2
does voters ' midterm reaction to @entity5 indicate some flagging in support for him among people of color ? could the @entity25 be making inroads with black voters ? well , first consider : last week @entity28 hosted " @entity29			1
" the show reprised a segment about blacks and president @entity5 called : how 's he doing ? the bit had an all - black panel , and after a few moments the discussion turned to the following question : what would it take for @entity5 to lose the black vote ? spoiler alert : there is no way for him to do that			1
it was just a comedy skit , but seems to be true in real life ; some may wonder why			0
after all , the unemployment rate for blacks remains high			0
in september the unemployment rate for whites was 4.9 % , while for blacks it was more than double that , at 10.8 %			0
the racial wealth gap also remains high			0
what is less well - known is that when you control for family income , black median wealth is less than one - third of white median wealth			0
put another way , at every income level , blacks only have a fraction of the wealth that similarly situated whites have			2
from a financial perspective , things are not good for many blacks when compared with their white peers -- in spite of there being a black president			0
nevertheless , there is widespread support of the president among blacks			2
so far , the @entity25 has given black voters little reason to shift its way , and @entity25 should not assume that black support will simply move to their side if they merely put forth a black candidate			1
a few of the reasons why : @entity25 - controlled state legislatures that enacted voter - @entity90 laws , coupled with @entity25 positions on affirmative action and immigration , are outside of the views held by most of the black community			2
but to be sure , black support for president @entity5 has eroded			1
@entity5 's favorability rating is down 9 percentage points from the beginning of the year and stands at 85 %			1
his favorability among whites has remained unchanged at 34 %			0
but black support is double that of whites			0
why ? is it because blacks always support blacks ? @entity107 justice @entity106 would say that ca n't be true , and tell that to the blacks who supported @entity111 in the 2008 primaries			1
no , i suspect it 's because we have empathy for the situation @entity5 finds himself in			1
he is n't even safe in his own home , for heaven 's sake			0
to quote @entity28 from the " @entity29 " segment : " run into @entity123 's lawn and see what happens			0
" what most blacks have in common with president @entity5 , is well -- we 're black			1
we 've all been disrespected at work ( remember " you lie ! " from rep. @entity130 )			0
we 've all been presumed incompetent : " why is the president 's response to @entity134 so weak ? " here 's why : because the @entity25 will not confirm his nominee for surgeon general			1
that is not president @entity5 's fault -- even though he receives the blame			1
last year , a @entity142 poll showed that when you polled the term " @entity145 " you received a different response than when you polled the term " @entity145 " : 46 % of the group asked about @entity145 opposed it , while 37 % asked about the @entity145 opposed it			0
it is not the president 's fault that when some voters hear his name associated with something they are more likely to reflexively oppose it			2
who does n't remember the " keep the government out of my @entity163 " signs when the @entity145 was being debated in town hall meetings across the country ? uh			0
... you almost did n't have the heart to tell them that @entity163 is a government program			0
early reports show that indeed @entity5 has not lost black support in the voting booth			1
about 90 % of blacks voted @entity172 in the 2014 midterm elections , roughly where they voted in 2012 and 2010			1
a high percentage of black voters will likely always support this president			2
his experiences are like our experiences			0
he may be the president , but ... he 's ... still ... black like us			0
but the midterms do not bode well for the @entity172 in 2016			1
republicans could not put enough images of president @entity5 in their election ads , and many @entity172 could not run away from the president fast enough			1
my favorite was @entity8 hopeful @entity189 refusing to say whether she even voted for president @entity5			2
contrast her response with that of a senator from @entity193 -- @entity194 -- a presidential aspirant who stated , at a @entity196 @entity25 field office in an @entity14 neighborhood , that the " @entity25 brand sucks , and so people do n't want to be a @entity25 and for 80 years , african - americans have had nothing to do with @entity25			2
" in 2016 when president @entity5 is no longer at the top of the ticket helping to get out the black vote out , @entity172 will have a different problem			1
if they lose , maybe they will blame that on president @entity5 as well .			2

@entity208 : did voters ' apparent rebuke of dems extend to blacks support ?
she says blacks still fair poorly on employment , wealth , but they still back @entity5 over @entity25
she says they identify with what he 's faced : disrespect , blame , *stonewalling*
@entity208 : blacks *reject* @entity25 's stance toward them . but @entity172 should worry about 2016
