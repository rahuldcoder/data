@entity0 -- a senior economist at the institution spearheading the bailouts of three eurozone countries has lambasted its lack of leadership and said its first female chief is not fit for the job			1
in a letter obtained exclusively by @entity1 and addressed to @entity13 , dean of the executive board of the @entity15 , 20 - year veteran @entity11 says he is " ashamed to have had any association with the fund at all			1
" @entity11 , a former advisor to the @entity15 's @entity18 , which runs its programs for @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 , argues the body 's failure to deliver timely and sustained warnings to the region 's dithering politicians had led to widespread suffering for those living in stricken countries and the risk of worse to come			2
the institution 's lack of decisive action , @entity11 says , has left " the second global reserve currency ( the euro ) on the brink			1
" " the fund for the past two years has been playing catch - up and reactive roles in the last ditch efforts to save it , " he writes			0
read full letter here @entity11 , a former @entity15 division head for @entity44 and non-eurozone nations @entity45 and @entity47 , was widely respected within the organization , according to @entity15 insiders who did not wish to be named due to the sensitivity of the issue			2
@entity11 did not work on countries within the monetary union , but his comments highlight strong feelings among the fund 's economists about its work underway in places like @entity20			0
his attack comes amid concerns the fund 's stringent austerity measures for debtor nations are doing more harm than good whilst failing to contain a crisis that is now well into its third year			0
@entity11 penned his missive on june 18 just as senior @entity15 representatives , including its first female managing director , @entity69 , were trying to hammer out a new set of emergency measures with key eurozone heads of government at the @entity74 in @entity75 , @entity76			1
@entity11 says one of the reasons the @entity15 has not delivered on its surveillance of the global economy is @entity82 bias which if anything , he says , is " becoming more deeply entrenched			2
" @entity69 : @entity85 crisis is ' everyone 's problem ' " this fact is most clear , " @entity11 states , " in regard to the appointments for managing director , which over the past decade , have all - too - evidently been disastrous			0
" referring to @entity69 -- who recently completed her first year in the role -- @entity11 says , " even the current incumbent is tainted , as neither her gender , integrity , or elan can make up for the fundamental illegitimacy of the selection process			0
" @entity11 , who copied in @entity100 , governor of the @entity102 , and @entity103 , head of the @entity45 's central bank , says his early warnings of the impending crisis were " identified well in advance but were suppressed			0
" @entity108 , a spokesman for the @entity15 in @entity109 , said the fund had found no evidence to substantiate that claim , from @entity11 or any other sources			1
@entity11 went on to accuse the @entity15 's board of preferring a " handicapped fund " paralyzed by the powerplay of international politics within its upper echelons and " subject to those proximate roots of surveillance failure			1
" " there are good salty people here , " @entity11 signs off , " but this one is moving on			0
you might want to take care not to lose others			0
" the @entity15 's @entity108 says , " a lot of the points raised are covered by a host of public reports related to the @entity15 's economic surveillance and public statements by the management on these issues			1
