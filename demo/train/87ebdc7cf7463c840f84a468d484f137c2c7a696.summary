-- several years ago , when my husband and i went to collect our newly adopted cat after surgery , the vet receptionist picked up the phone and languidly informed whoever was at the other end : " @entity11 's mommy and daddy are here to pick her up			1
apparently i had a baby			1
a furry one , currently stapled together with a cone on its head			0
there are various types of pet owners			1
at one end of the spectrum is the " no nonsense " variety who believe the lines between beast and human are far too often blurred			2
at the other extreme are those whose pet is categorically their baby			1
and then there 's everyone in between			0
for many , consciously or otherwise , a pet is a practice child , a step up in responsibility between none and a lot			1
something to love and take care of , but that you can leave alone when you go out for dinner without fear that it will die			0
this is perhaps why so frequently the horse ( dog , cat , or chinchilla ) comes before the ( baby ) carriage			1
but what happens to your " pet baby " when it comes time for a real human child to join your family ? our baby is due in july , and despite my occasional fantasies that the cat wo n't notice , i know that in reality she will , and i do n't think she will like it			1
the cat sleeps in our bed , commands attention whenever she desires , and does n't have to share her living space with anything of a remotely similar size			1
dr. @entity70 , from @entity72 's @entity71 , says that more than 50 % of the practice 's clients who have a new baby find their pets are stressed , nervous and upset by it			1
when a pet is used to being the baby , it can be disconcerting to suddenly have to compete with what appears to be a tiny , yelling object vying for the spotlight			1
" they were our kids , " says @entity85 of dogs @entity86 and @entity88 prior to their baby 's arrival			2
" we arranged weekend outings around them , indulged them			0
put their needs first at all times , almost			0
" the same was true for @entity99 before her son came along			0
" it was all about @entity102 , all the time , " she says of their rescue havanese , " he was a first thought always			0
" however you see your pet -- baby , miscellaneous family member , friend , possession , colleague , animated stuffed animal -- chances are that it thinks of itself as the creamy filling to your @entity120 and wo n't enjoy being usurped by a screaming upstart			1
" the dynamic changes , " @entity123 explains , " and the pet realizes it 's no longer the center of the universe			2
" no matter how you slice it , babies -- especially newborns -- demand a huge amount of time , attention and energy , often leaving a deficit for your furry friend			0
" i think @entity102 was depressed for a while , " says @entity134 , " the first four months were the hardest			0
he was n't getting out as much as he used to and was n't getting the same amount of attention during the day			2
i felt really badly for him			2
" problems adapting to your bundle of joy can range in pets from mild to severe			0
" a cat can withdraw , stop eating , develop a medical problem , deviate from normal cat habits -- urinate or defecate outside of box , become destructive , anorexic , aggressive , " says cat therapist @entity143 , adding that a very anxious cat could even attack the baby or other family members			1
@entity123 says dogs can also become more aggressive , often in a misguided attempt to protect the baby			2
our cat is fairly neurotic -- a kind of cat version of , perhaps , @entity158 -- and is not a huge fan of any kind of change , no matter how minute			2
thus our goal has been to arm ourselves with as much information as possible on smoothing the transition at home from pet palace to nursery			1
we hope this will help us avoid a kitty mental breakdown			0
there 's a lot of advice out there for pet owners with similar concerns			2
@entity123 says bringing a used baby blanket home from the hospital prior to the baby 's arrival can help your pet become accustomed to the scent			1
she says some pet owners have also used plug - in pheromone diffusers , which can help to calm animals during the period of transition			1
@entity143 suggests a multifaceted approach with cats , including a lot of feeding , petting , name - crooning and general attention around the time that cat and baby meet			1
she also recommends desensitizing the ( poor ) cat by playing a recording of a baby crying , and perhaps having a friend 's child come over to play so the cat gets used to kids , and presumably is then less prone to a full blown freakout when sticky hands grab its tail			1
she details more approaches in her book , " the @entity210 for your cat			2
" @entity85 said when they bought their daughter home from the hospital , they let the dogs sniff her feet and get to know her , making sure never to leave them with her unsupervised			0
@entity134 , meanwhile , sums up their approach as " @entity223 " ( no dog left behind )			0
" we call him our firstborn son and he is the baby 's brother , " she says , " we try really hard to make him feel special and not that he has been sidelined			2
" but in case you were wondering if the upshot of all of this is a disneyesque house of harmony where pet and baby frolic and snuggle in happy unison , you may be asking too much			1
while @entity239 is becoming increasingly fascinated by the furry creature sharing his home , @entity134 says dog @entity102 -- while tolerant -- does not return the interest level			0
" he sniffs him and then goes about his business			0
" lack of interest , however , is still one of the better outcomes			0
some pets never come around to the change in circumstances			0
@entity143 says it can be a good idea to arrange a " worst - case scenario , " alternative home for your pet , in case all else fails			2
but there are some happy endings			0
@entity143 describes one cat who , after an initial show of aggressive behavior , became devoted to the new baby and now acts as a kind of " cat nanny , " standing guard over its little friend , maybe wearing a pinafore ( that part possibly is just in my imagination )			1
and according to @entity274 , @entity86 and @entity88 's affections have increased exponentially along with the baby 's propensity to drop food on the floor			0
@entity86 now even lets her ride on his back			0
" i think they adapted to the situation the same way we adapted our lives , going from crazy , freedom - loving 20s into responsible married 30s , " she says , " i think they 've enjoyed parenthood , too			0

when a pet is used to being babied , a new human baby can upset the household balance
@entity301 is concerned her cat @entity11 will react badly when her baby is born
veterinarians recommend *slowly* *acclimating* your pet to the possibility a child is coming
the transition is n't always smooth , but careful *planning* and *preparation* can pay off
