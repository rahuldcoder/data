@entity0 -- @entity2 already had a national identity before he decided to run for senator			1
the media - savvy , tweet - happy mayor from @entity7 -- who easily won the @entity10 @entity9 primary for @entity11 tuesday -- has been known for his man - of - the - people streak , charismatic presence and social media intensity , or as some say , fixation			1
@entity2 becomes @entity9 nominee for @entity11 seat but can he make the switch from a nationally popular hands - on mayor to the contentious spotlight of the @entity23 ? @entity2 , in his path to tuesday 's win , weathered a few negative headlines , but came out largely unscathed by his @entity9 opponents			1
his @entity29 challenger , former @entity30 mayor @entity28 , may be able to go after @entity2 for spending more time on his national profile than on running the city he leads			1
but several polls show @entity2 running away with the special election on october 16 and becoming the first @entity36 elected to the @entity11 since @entity37			1
despite the possible attacks , experts in @entity10 politics and friends close to @entity2 tell @entity1 that there is little chance the mayor 's national profile will diminish if he heads to the @entity11 later this year			1
" i would n't expect those media requests are going to abate because he moved into a new role , " said @entity46 , a friend of @entity2 's and the author of " @entity48 : @entity2 , @entity7 , and @entity52			1
" but is that a good thing ? @entity2 shoots down 2016 presidential bid @entity55 or @entity56 ? when @entity55 of @entity57 was elected to the @entity11 in 2012 , she came in as someone with substantial liberal chops and national notoriety for her expertise on banking and consumer rights issues			1
after arriving in the @entity11 , however , @entity64 shied away from national media attention and is no longer a regular on the interview circuit			1
that likely wo n't be the case with @entity2			2
" the difference between him and @entity55 ( is ) , he has already mastered social media and mainstream media in a way that she has n't , " @entity46 said			0
in six years as @entity7 's mayor , @entity2 gained notoriety for an experiential kind of leadership			1
late last year , the mayor lived on food stamps in order to show how difficult relying on the government program can be			0
from 1998 to 2006 , @entity2 lived in a housing project as a way to connect with constituents			2
these stories -- along with others -- have made @entity2 a household name in @entity10 and national politics			1
on @entity90 , the mayor has a massive 1.4 million followers and has sent more than 30,000 tweets in his time on the site			0
it is n't unusual to see @entity2 direct message constituents who tweet him with issues -- in fact , it has become part of his persona			2
and that might be a problem for @entity2			2
as a possible preview to attacks that could be leveled against the mayor in the future , @entity29 have questioned how @entity2 could rise so high nationally from such an unusual perch			1
" there is something decidedly odd about the whole @entity2 phenomenon , " wrote @entity110 , a @entity29 strategist , in a @entity112 opinion piece			1
" someone who managed to become a national political figure as mayor of the nation 's 67th - largest city , he is dangerously close to falling into the celebrity trap of being famous for being famous			1
" that idea -- that @entity2 is famous for being famous -- has begun to circle at home , too			1
" the phrase that everyone has been throwing around here is workhorse vs. showhorse , " said @entity125 , associate director of the @entity126 at @entity127			0
" i think he certainly has a unique path to political prominence , " @entity125 said			0
" people used to say being mayor of @entity135 was a dead end job politically , but nobody ever said being mayor of @entity7 was a path to higher office			1
he has certainly had some accomplishment as mayor of @entity7 , but it is almost ( that ) his fame is on a separate track as his record from @entity7			1
" in particular , @entity125 notes , @entity2 is regularly in front of the camera on national news , but rarely to talk about @entity7			1
instead , he said , he is booked because of his charisma and ability to talk about @entity9 politics , in general			2
@entity46 thinks those critiques are somewhat unfair			0
instead of comparing him to the media - shy @entity64 , the @entity2 chronicler said the more apt comparison is with former sen. @entity56 of @entity158			2
when @entity56 was elected to the @entity11 in 1998 , the @entity158 was known as the charismatic lawyer who gained national attention for protecting patients ' rights against doctors and hospitals in a 1985 case			2
when he got to the @entity11 , he became a party standout and was the champion of an issue that put him in front of cameras with some regularity : tort reform			2
if @entity2 can find an issue , @entity46 said , the comparison with @entity56 -- who ran for president in 2004 and 2008 -- could stick			2
how far can @entity2 go ? even when @entity2 was a @entity178 member , people who came into contact with him said they could see him running for president someday			0
" having known him for a long time , people were talking about him being the first black president in 2001 and 2002 , " @entity46 said			0
" it is looking more plausible now			0
" @entity125 shared a similar story			0
cost to win congressional election skyrockets " i think a small number of political figures who from the beginning of their career , lead people to say i can imagine him becoming president , " @entity125 said			0
" it has been true of @entity2			0
" earlier this month , @entity2 ruled out the possibility of running for president in 2016			0
asked by @entity196 whether he would rule out a presidential or vice presidential bid in the next election cycle , @entity2 responded with three words : " absolutely yes , unequivocally			2
" but that does n't mean never			0
and with the @entity9 ' markedly short bench on future presidential candidates , along with @entity2 's ability to command national attention and hefty amounts of fundraising dollars , the possibility is clearly there			1
with those attributes comes another , more grandiose comparison , with president @entity37			0
supporters , such as @entity46 , said the comparisons have to do with a mix of race , charisma and electoral history			0
and , of course , possible presidential aspirations			0
but it is in that last regard that @entity46 looked to distance @entity2 from @entity37			0
" if @entity2 were to run in 2020 , he would have served a full term as @entity223 senator , " she said , " which would be different than president @entity37			0
" last month , the two sides of @entity2 -- the political rising star and the national media figure -- came into conflict when a scheduling snafu for a speaking gig at the @entity231 , the state that traditionally hosts the first caucus of the presidential election season , put his possible @entity236 aspirations into focus			1
all part of the game , says @entity125			0
" i think @entity2 will have to face that , " he said , referring to the mayor being asked about running for president " if he goes to @entity244 , that will be looked at through the lens			2
" " the @entity9 do n't have a deep bench , so i think every conversation about the future of the party that extends past @entity250 and @entity251 , he will be on the list			0

@entity7 mayor @entity2 won the @entity9 primary for the @entity11 seat from @entity10
many polls have him well ahead of his @entity29 challenger for the oct. 16 special election
his national popularity has led some to worry if he is " famous for being famous "
