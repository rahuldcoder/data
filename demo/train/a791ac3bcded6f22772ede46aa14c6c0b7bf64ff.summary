@entity0 , @entity1 -- i work at an inland university in chilly @entity5			0
around here , many people feel a little global warming is good and there is really nothing that they can see or hear that will make them feel differently			1
news of warming sea surfaces and bleached coral reefs inspire little response when there 's a chill in the air and the ocean is hundreds of miles away			1
sure , the ice is off the lakes a few weeks earlier and the growing season is a couple of weeks longer			0
but there are costs we are seeing now -- mosquitoes , ticks and other species of insects are really thriving with the warmer weather while some species of trees , like sugar maple , are suffering slow declines			0
however , none of these small , incremental impacts gives one a sense of imminent disaster , but the reality is that increased sea - surface temperatures will impact hundreds of millions of people , whether they live in @entity45 or @entity46			1
in contrast to the incremental changes we are seeing here in the heartland , the sea is already undergoing catastrophic changes on a massive scale , ones that are unprecedented in human history and that may be largely irreversible on human time scales			2
during the past few months , coral bleaching near @entity60 , @entity61 , in the @entity62 and in the @entity63 of @entity64 has left vast tracts of reefs impacted , with up to 80 percent of the corals dead or dying at some sites			1
bleaching occurs when corals get so thermally stressed that the symbiotic relationship with their solar - powered algae falls apart , and the pigmented algae get expelled			0
the result is a bleached reef that looks starkly white because the white skeleton underlying the coral skin shows through			2
imagine if overnight all of the leaves on the trees in your neighborhood turned white from losing their photosynthetic pigments			0
then think about what it would look like if more than half of those trees did n't recover and died			0
coral reefs are an ecosystem rich in biodiversity beyond our wildest imagining -- we are still discovering the countless links that support transforming nutrient - poor tropical oceans into an oasis of life			1
reefs provide a home to countless small crabs , worms , starfish and rich zooplankton which hide in the reef by day and come out at night to be a rich banquet for fish			1
young fish shelter and feed in the reef , until large enough to survive elsewhere			2
gobies are an example of a small reef fish that shows big declines on reefs affected by bleaching ; the butterfly fish also is a species that feeds directly on coral and so declines with reef damage			1
reefs that have bleached and died quickly erode and can not fix carbon from the sun or provide habitat for fish			1
even as i write this , i am anticipating that one of the largest bleaching events in the history of the @entity128 is under way			0
we do n't know yet if this event will become the largest because it has not reached its peak			0
i have checked @entity135 's @entity134 website every week this august and september to monitor the sea surface temperatures and to try to guess at what level they might peak			1
currently , the trajectory is on course to be markedly warmer than the record - breaking summer of 2005			0
during that year of record - breaking bleaching and devastating hurricanes , including @entity144 , scientists identified the extreme sea surface temperatures as a once - in - a - 100 - year event			1
well , here we are five years later , and with a month to go before the expected temperature maximum during mid-october , it looks like we are in for a greater once - in - a - 100 - year event in the space of five years ! so , this raises the question -- does this really matter to folks in the heartland ? does it matter that nobody is even aware that this huge event is even going on ? well , it matters if we care about global biodiversity , since those reefs in the @entity62 are at the center of both fish and coral biodiversity			1
it also matters if we care about the people who make their living on the fish , snails , crabs , and other animals that live on the reefs in the @entity62 , @entity64 , and the @entity128 -- and the people who eat seafood in your town and every town			2
it matters if we are concerned about future tsunamis in the @entity180 because those reefs are the strongest wavebreaks known to protect fragile coastal communities			0
and finally , it matters because coral reefs fuel billions in tourist dollars to fragile economies in the developing world as well as in our territorial waters			1
so , for people who are concerned about the fate of the global environment and human civilization , it does matter			0
we are an ocean nation with vast areas of coral reefs			1
the exclusive economic zone of the @entity200 includes not only a 200 - mile coastal zone around our fifty states , but a 200 - mile zone around rich marine resources in the @entity180 , including @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 and @entity208			2
it is important to realize that the effects of climate change are being felt more directly in the oceans than on land			0
just because they are out of sight does not mean that they should be out of mind			0
most people have not experienced firsthand the already disastrous impacts of climate change on our ocean			0
but soon enough we will start to notice disruptions in terrestrial ecosystems as well			0
to help coral reefs and other affected coastal ecosystems , much more stringent management policies must be implemented to control overfishing and land - based pollution			1
this can improve the resilience of these climate - stressed ecosystems			0
in the larger policy arena , to slow this sea surface warming we must not only reduce greenhouse gas emissions , we have to figure out a way to get the @entity237 concentration below the level of the 388 parts per million it is at now			2
the target of 350 ppm @entity237 advocated by 350.org movement is a way forward if future generations are to benefit from the services coral reefs provide and the sense of awe that they inspire			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity251 .			2

*higher* sea temperatures are damaging coral reefs around the world , says @entity251
she says the reefs provide a crucial habitat for fish and a lure for tourists
some effects of global warming are most *visible* in our seas , she says
as an ocean nation , the @entity200 has much at risk , @entity251 says
