-- @entity1 filled the streets with the help of @entity4			2
@entity6 's protests were coordinated on @entity8 pages like that of internet activist @entity10			1
@entity12 dissenters spread the word about their " day of rage " last week the same way			2
and yet , in these heady days where the entire @entity17 seems to be inspired to organize online in revolt against autocracy , it has become fashionable for experts to dismiss the role of social media in 2011 's revolutions			1
" people protested and brought down governments before @entity8 was invented , " the @entity26 's @entity25 opined on february 2			1
a few weeks later , @entity30 ' @entity29 reminded us that " the @entity32 managed to storm the @entity33 without the help of @entity4 -- and the @entity34 took the @entity35 without pausing to post photos of each other on @entity8			1
" true enough -- and utterly irrelevant			0
those uprisings had a strong assist from contemporary technology too			1
the @entity34 revolution would hardly have happened without the telegraphs and trains that spirited @entity43 to the @entity45 station at the right moment			1
and what would the @entity32 revolution have been without the latest high - tech gadget , hot from the workshop of dr. @entity51 ? yes , of course , technology alone does n't make revolutions			1
the will of the people is the most vital ingredient			0
to foment revolt , first let their resentment simmer for a few decades			0
but that does n't mean social media can not provide wavering revolutionaries with vital aid and comfort			0
remember the kids interviewed in @entity67 the night @entity68 resigned ? what struck me most was what they were doing while waiting for the reporter to finish his introduction : thumbing on their smartphones			0
want to hazard a guess at the website they were checking ? consider what @entity8 is : it 's the internet , refined and focused like a laser beam that bounces off you and your acquaintances with unsurpassed speed			1
none of its features are particularly new			0
they 're tried and tested			0
we 've been sharing instant messages , blog - like daily details and rants , and coordinating projects and meetups online since those @entity67 kids were babes in arms			0
we 've just never done all that in the same place , in front of so many of our friends , for hours at a time			0
we 've never created a club that 's half a billion people strong and growing faster than ever , a club with room in it for literally any point of view			1
and we 've certainly never carried that club in our pockets , around the world			0
consider what else that makes @entity8 : democracy in action , or at least the closest thing we see in our daily lives			1
a cacophony of viewpoints explode out of the briefest statements			0
could you imagine how many comments you 'd get on your @entity8 wall in the next 10 minutes if you posted " i < 3 @entity123 ? " ( go ahead , try it			1
) now imagine you 're a dictator trying to infiltrate those acres of free speech			0
who wants to friend a @entity12 secret policeman ? ( ask your pals , they probably now think you are one			0
) keeping a beady eye on who said what to whom in this cacophony could take a lifetime			0
you could , of course , shut down the entire internet			0
@entity68 tried that , and it quickly became apparent that he 'd also cut off the country 's lifeblood : commerce and tourism			2
or you could do what @entity144 has done for the last two years , and block access to @entity4 and @entity8 specifically			1
in which case , you draw attention to their power , and give rise to homegrown copycats ( such as @entity153 and @entity154 , in @entity144 's case			2
) @entity25 is right to argue that only strong social ties create revolutions			2
but he is wrong to say that @entity4 and @entity8 constitute weak social ties			1
he may believe this because he is a highly productive writer , and may never have been sucked into a two - hour @entity8 hole			1
those of us who have know what it 's like down there			2
it is n't some kind of vapid virtual bar scene			0
okay , there is an element of that : the sense of perpetual party is what draws so many there in the first place			0
but what keeps us there is the fact that barriers between friends -- lack of time , too much distance , lazy years - long silences -- are annihilated			0
the faces of @entity6 's @entity188 post a quick dumb comment on an old estranged friend 's status update , and the next thing you know you 're trading viewpoints like college roommates			2
start a @entity8 group for your passion project , and realize you were never alone in wanting to make your ideal real			1
it is impossible to live in that kind of environment -- and make no mistake , we are starting to live there -- without noticing how much the real world fails to measure up			2
as @entity8 continues to spread -- the trend line suggests it will reach 3 billion users , or roughly half the planet , by 2017 -- more and more monolithic cultures are in for a shock			1
true , not all of them are @entity17 - style powder kegs			0
but sparks can ignite in all sorts of ways			0
for example , the fastest - growing segment of @entity8 users is women over 55			1
think what a smart , self - aware network of grandmas could do for the world 's poorest regions			2
so perhaps there is one reason not to call events in @entity6 and its ilk a @entity8 revolution			1
the real @entity8 revolution is global , and it 's only just getting geared up .			1

the uprisings had a strong assist from contemporary technology
what else makes @entity8
the real @entity8 revolution is global , and it 's only just getting geared up
