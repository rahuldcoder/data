-- for @entity3 producers , @entity1 brought some extra trimmings this year			1
according to figures from the @entity7 , a dozen @entity3 shows topped $ 1 million at the box office for the week ending nov. 25 — the first time that 's happened all year			1
perennial musical hits led the list : " @entity12 " ( $ 2.3 million ) , " @entity13 " ( $ 2.1 million ) , " @entity14 " ( $ 1.8 million ) , and " @entity15 : @entity16 " ( $ 1.78 million )			1

( premium ticket charges spiked the average ticket price to $ 116 , from $ 89 the week before			2

" @entity52 " used the @entity1 holiday to scale back its schedule to five performances ( instead of its usual seven )			0
as a result , its haul last week was just $ 853,737 , down from $ 1.16 million the previous week			2
@entity64 : who will win ' @entity66 ' ? meanwhile , turkey time had a very different meaning for the producers of " @entity70 , " the new musical biography of @entity72 with book and lyrics by @entity75			1
in its first full week since its nov. 15 opening , the show scraped up a thin gruel of $ 194,511 , less than 16 percent of its potential gross , and played to houses that were less than one third full			2
