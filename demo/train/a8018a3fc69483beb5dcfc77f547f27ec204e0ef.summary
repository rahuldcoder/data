-- the fight against sexism has suddenly become all the rage among politicians			1
it took one politician , a woman , to put it all in perspective			2
if you have not heard the speech from prime minister @entity11 on the floor of the @entity13 , do yourself a favor			2
this is one for the ages			0
nobody has unmasked political hypocrisy with such fire , with such passion , in a long , long time			0
we have heard the poll - tested , calculated claims by politicians around the globe			2
we hear it in presidential debates in the @entity28 , where the election may depend on the support of female voters , and we 've heard it in places like @entity34 , where politicians want to benefit from the outrage over the shooting of 14 - year - old @entity38 after assassins tried to kill her for defending every girl 's right to an education			1
in @entity44 , the political battle revolved around a very unique , rather strange , set of circumstances			1
but @entity11 's words crystallized the source of the unease that hangs over so many people as they hear politicians courting them			2
how much can we believe what they say ? much became clear after the speech in @entity54 , when @entity11 unloaded a sizzling rhetorical barrage on @entity56 , the leader of the opposition , who had presented a motion he claimed was motivated by his own support of women 's equality			1
@entity11 would have none of it			0
" i will not be lectured about misogyny by this man			0
not now , not ever , " she intoned , pointing directly at @entity56 , who sat in his chair trying to keep a plastic smile on his face , no doubt hoping it would all end soon			0
but @entity11 was just getting started			0
the @entity44 prime minister , glancing only occasionally at a sheet of notes , eviscerated her opponent 's claim that he had a sincere interest in standing up for women			1
you could detect a brief wince of anguish in @entity56 's tense brow when @entity11 suggested " @entity81 through the opposition leader 's repulsive double standards			1
" she went on to list , one by one , instances that demonstrate a track record of disdain for women by the opposition leader			1
@entity56 was claiming to be offended by crude , sexist text messages , sent by the speaker of the @entity13 , who happened to be a supporter of the prime minister			0
the speaker eventually resigned his position			0
but @entity11 , to the consternation of some @entity44 , would not support @entity56 's motion to fire him			1
if @entity56 thinks misogynists are not suited for high office , she said , he should take a piece of paper and write out his resignation			0
" if he wants to know what misogyny looks like in modern @entity44 , he does n't need a motion in the @entity13 , " @entity11 charged , " he needs a mirror			1
@entity11 's now - famous " @entity112 " became such a worldwide hit that publishing house @entity109 decided to update its definition of " misogyny			2
" the old definition is " hatred of women			2
" @entity109 said it will add a new meaning , " entrenched prejudice against women , " reflecting the word 's modern usage			1
the speech became a hit because of its raw eloquence and visceral emotion			2
but it would not have ignited a fast - spreading fire if it had not touched flammable material			0
@entity11 's words resonated because we have all heard hypocritical politicians make claims that have the tinny ring of untruth , an echo of political consultant and focus - group regurgitation			1
the phenomenon becomes more prevalent , not surprisingly , when elections approach			2
in @entity34 , for example , the country is preparing to hold elections this year			2
the attempt to kill @entity38 by the supremely misogynistic @entity34 @entity143 came just in time for politicians to try to fuel their campaigns with popular sentiment			0
the populist @entity147 , a former cricket superstar who has entered politics , rushed to @entity38 's bedside and was quick to condemn the attempted murder , as were many politicians			0
but , like many others , he refused to blame the @entity143 , even though the group openly admitted to the hit and vowed to try again to kill her , reaffirming its revolting anti-women ideology			0
a closer look at @entity147 's views , despite his show of support for @entity38 , indicates that he is unlikely to challenge the @entity143 , even if that means sacrificing women 's rights			1
in the @entity28 , the last presidential debate came just after a @entity164 poll showed @entity166 @entity165 tying president @entity167 in likely swing state votes from women			1
@entity167 had relied on an advantage with women to stay ahead in the polls			0
not surprisingly , the two men came out prepared for a full - on joust for the women 's vote			1
by one count , the two mentioned women 30 times in the last debate , with @entity167 wrapping himself in his support for equal pay legislation and @entity165 making his much - maligned claim to have relied on " binders full of women " to find qualified candidates for high office while he was governor of @entity189			1
@entity190 : @entity165 's empty ' binders full of women ' i am not arguing that the " binders " are a fantasy , nor am i saying that @entity167 or @entity165 are sexist			1
what i do say is that , increasingly , what we hear from politicians is carefully calculated			0
it is not calculated for accuracy ; it is calibrated for effect			0
that means women , and those who want to see the realization of a vision of equality , of an end to sexism and misogyny , need to consume the words of politicians with a large serving of skepticism			0
every claim , every promise , must be checked against a track record to find whether it 's true and whether it is a good predictor of what they would do after the election , when standing up for women 's rights may not prove as timely and convenient as it does today			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity225 .			0

fiery speech by @entity44 's leader slams a politician 's newly found support of women
@entity233 : male candidates ' promises to women usually *forgotten* after elections
suddenly supporting women 's issues is a hypocritical bid for votes , she says
@entity245 : women must take claims with grain of salt and examine candidates ' track records
