@entity0 , @entity1 -- if cranes are a visual barometer of the economic vibe of a city then central @entity0 is buzzing			1
targeted car bombings linked to the ongoing @entity9 conflict have raised anxiety and hurt overall growth in the @entity1 capital in recent years			1
but this seems to be a city that endures when it comes to real estate			1
during the boom years towards the end of the last decade , total sales rose by 36 % here hitting nearly $ 9.5 billion in 2010 , according to @entity21			2
and even though there was a slowdown last year , real estate purchases fell just 2.4 % to $ 8.7 billion			1
according to local property expert @entity27 , financial troubles elsewhere in the world have failed to dampen local or international interest in @entity1 's high end property market			1
" despite figures which show some kind of slowdown or stagnation , there are 400 real estate projects which are ongoing in @entity0 , corresponding to close to 2 million square meters of development , " @entity27 said			1
one such initiative is the 3 @entity0 project in the center of the city 's bustling business district			2
although a couple of years behind schedule , the structure designed by @entity46 architects @entity42 is comfortably selling units priced as high as $ 10,000 per square meter ( $ 929 per sq ft ) , senior adviser to the project , @entity51 , told @entity2			0
elsewhere , developers like @entity53 have been throwing up boutique , modern apartments with a total area between 30 and 70 square meters to cater for modern city living			0
on the city 's waterfront , meanwhile , @entity46 design firm @entity58 is making a statement with the edgy @entity63 leisure and residence development			0
this particular area of the city has had huge support from @entity1 investors based abroad			2
over the last 6 years , there 's been nearly $ 100 billion of net inflows into the country , more than half of which came in the midst of the financial crisis between 2008 and 2010			0
" at the end of the day , they ( @entity1 investors ) are working all over the world , @entity81 , @entity79 ( @entity80 ) countries but they all need to come and own part of the country , " said general manager of @entity63 , @entity77			0
@entity86 said he has sold a fifth of the flats ahead of the delayed opening in april with almost all going to @entity1 people outside the country			0
while these investors may not suffer the first hand effects of car bombs or other violent spillover from @entity9 , @entity0 's continuing appeal is a sign that this city has been shaken but not toppled during another period of regional uncertainty			2
