-- if you did n't know that @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 were members of @entity6 , you might think they belonged to three different bands -- and @entity2 is the first to admit it			1
" one guy 's just a ball of sunshine			1
that 's @entity4 , " the singer said			1
" then @entity3 is like a black hole sometimes , like places where he goes			1
and me ? i 'm just like a pingpong ball put in the cosmos , man			1
" and that , ladies and gentlemen , pretty much sums up the genius of @entity6 -- the friction of three disparate parts rubbing together , until finally , it explodes into a glorious musical fireball			1
it 's a chemical reaction that , throughout the band 's 26 - year - history , has all too often imploded as well			1
" i 'm not really sure how many times we 've parted ways , " said @entity3 , the group 's guitarist			1
" i was n't really one of the people who thought we would n't be back together , primarily because we 've gotten back together so many times over the years			1
we do n't break up anymore			1
we just go on five - year hiatuses			1
" the alternative rock pioneers are prepping the october 18 release of " @entity38 , " their first studio album in eight years			1
" the sound is definitely updated on this album , " @entity2 said			1
" the differences are that we are now working with synthesizers and computer software that goes with guitars , so you 'll hear a lot of very modern sounds mixed in with what people call the ageless , or timeless , sound of @entity6			2
" with original bassist @entity52 , @entity6 put a soundtrack to the gritty @entity55 underground arts scene of the late 1980s			2
the group 's first studio album , " @entity58 , " was an examination of love , lust , violence and drugs			2
by 1990 , the band was all over rock radio with " stop ! " and " @entity68 , " a pair of hit singles off its sophomore disc , " @entity70			1
" the new cd is only the group 's fourth studio album			2
" we pull from the environment , " said drummer @entity4			2
" @entity6 wrote our ( first ) music in @entity77 in 1986			2
you hear that @entity80 is only 100 miles away from us			2
you can hear the struggle , and also the glory , of being a musician in @entity79 our music was never negative , but it had that strong urge			2
you wanted to go f * * k , not to go punch			2
and i think @entity90 's still has that			2
" @entity0 visited the band during a video shoot for the new single , " @entity94 , " on a @entity77 soundstage			1
@entity2 , the lyricist , said the song chronicles how the universe was created			1
" i say the big bang was actually a conscious act of cosmic lovemaking			2
" @entity4 , the pragmatist , has a different interpretation			2
" to me , the ' @entity94 ' is what pulls me , @entity3 and @entity2 together			1
ever since i was 13 , i 've been playing with @entity3			2
i met @entity2 when i was 17			1
and no matter how much we stopped playing with each other , and tried to get away from each other , it 's the magnet -- it pulls us closer			2
" the band members discussed their reunion and new album and how they 've avoid fistfights for nearly two decades : @entity0 : how does it feel to have @entity6 back together again ? @entity2 : i love performing with @entity6			1
i hope i get to do it all my life			0
it 's healthy for bands to take a break every now and then			0
people are really looking forward to this new record because they 're a little starved			0
i 'm pulling the old woman 's trick of making them want , and want , and need and desire			0
@entity0 : who 's the peacemaker who calls and says , " let 's try this again ? " @entity3 : i do n't really know how it happens			1
i 'm all about peace , but it 's like with any family			0
if there 's a conflict in a family , and it 's @entity135 , and everybody gets together , and you have a few drinks and you start chatting with the family member that you have a problem with -- next thing you know , it 's all water under the bridge			0
@entity4 : if we 're not getting along , we do n't just stay together because we 're getting paid for it			0
but when we like each other , the music sounds better , and it feels better to cash those checks when you 're doing it with friends			0
@entity3 : the old stuff percolates , of course , but the tools we have as adults are different to handle it , you know what i mean ? when you 're younger , you 're not as equipped -- or at least we were n't equipped -- to handle diverse personalities			0
what seemed a big deal at 19 is way less of a big deal in your 40s			0
@entity0 : so no awesome fistfights lately ? @entity3 : no , no. people keep asking about that			1
that was done in like ' 91			0
that was done a long time ago , and i do n't even have any recollection of that			0
@entity0 : maybe that was part of the problem			1
@entity3 : that probably contributed to the problem			0
( @entity178 ) @entity0 : do you think you 'd still be making music if you had continued to live the way you were living ? @entity3 : well , i ca n't speak for anybody else about that , but i certainly feel that any day above ground is a blessing			1
@entity0 : how do you think you guys would have held up through the scrutiny that 's part of today 's culture ? @entity3 : when @entity6 got started , it was the ' 80s , and there were n't cell phones , and there were n't people chasing people down the street with cameras , and there was n't the @entity201 , and there was n't cable news the way it is now			1
and i do n't know if we 'd be where we are , quite frankly , if there was , because we had some what i 'd like to call ' colorful times			0
' you know , the less widely reported , the better			0
@entity0 : in order to generate press sometimes , you ca n't be just a musician			1
you have to be a musician / celebrity			0
@entity3 : i did n't write the book , but i read the book that earlier had been written by @entity218			0
@entity0 : are people meaner now ? @entity3 : back in the old days , there was no " commenting " section			1
whatever comments you had were up here ( points to his head ) , or you told your friend			0
it was n't like public fodder			0
so yeah , people are meaner now			0
but you 've got to take the attitude of , " ok , we 're in a blessed position			0
" you ca n't ask the world to entirely love you			0
@entity0 : the story of @entity6 is very rock ' n ' roll			1
@entity2 : we 've definitely had some dark moments			1
what would a story be without the dark moments ? part of the greatness of any story is that you can rise up out of that darkness and shake off the dust and the dirt			0
@entity0 : how are things different now ? @entity2 : socially , we 've never really hung out , although these days , i 'm inviting the guys to things that i do just because i love ' em. but we definitely go to different parts of the universe			1
some bands , they all have to like the same thing , and as a result , the sound is very linear , and once the time passes , they sound dated			0
when it comes to our prescription , we like to have different elements of music and influence coming together			0
that 's what makes a new sound			0
@entity4 : @entity6 used to be the only thing in my life , and now , i 've got so many other things			0
my pie has got a few slices			0
there is n't just one slice			0
but it 's always got whipped cream on it , and it 's always really warm , and i ca n't wait to get another bite of it .			0
