" and then when they 're conducting an investigation , i 've got to make sure that i do n't look like i 'm putting my thumb on the scales one way or the other			1
" should @entity1 be more forceful ? but some believe @entity1 should be more forceful , especially following community and political criticism of the initial police response to street protests as excessive , and with those demonstrations becoming more violent			1
" this president knows better than most what happens in poor communities that have been antagonized historically by the hostile relationship between black people and the police department , " @entity58 professor @entity57 said sunday on @entity60 's " @entity59			1
