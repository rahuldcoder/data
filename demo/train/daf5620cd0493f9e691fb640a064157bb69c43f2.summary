@entity0 -- responding to recent accidents linked to pilot fatigue , federal safety officials hope reduce airline pilots ' logging 14 - hour days			1
the @entity6 currently allows pilots to log 14 - hour workdays , which the @entity9 says contributes to accidents			1
the @entity9 concluded in a report out tuesday that pilot fatigue was a probable cause in a runway landing accident during bad weather in @entity16 last winter			1
the @entity6 currently allows a 14 - hour workday with eight hours of logged airtime			1
" it 's a critical issue ; it 's an insidious issue			0
many times , the pilots themselves do n't even recognize that they are fatigued when they get into that cockpit , " @entity9 chairman @entity22 said			1
and @entity22 made the same points about air traffic controllers more than a year ago , in april 2007			0
in a letter to the @entity6 , @entity22 said that four other plane incidents " provide clear and compelling evidence " that controllers are sometimes operating while fatigued because of their work schedules and poor use of rest periods			2
" that fatigue has contributed to controller errors , " @entity22 wrote in 2007			0
" fourteen hours is still a very long day , " @entity9 board member @entity38 said			2
her conclusion is backed by 40 years of airline accident statistics compiled by the @entity6 and cited tuesday at an @entity9 hearing			2
" after a duty period of about 10 to 12 hours , the number of observed accidents increased exponentially , " @entity9 staff member @entity42 said			0
in february , the cockpit crew of a passenger plane operated by @entity48 failed to answer air traffic controllers for 18 minutes , missed the flight 's destination in @entity52 and continued for another 15 miles at 21,000 feet over the @entity53			0
the investigation has shown that " both pilots unintentionally fell asleep during cruise flight , " @entity9 staff member @entity55 said during a presentation to the safety board			2
the crew of @entity61 flight 1002 eventually answered concerned calls on the radio from ground controllers , turned around and safely landed			0
the @entity9 report called for analysis of sleep quantity , sleep quality , performance , errors and incidents traced to schedules that disrupt sleep patterns , perhaps while stretching workloads to the maximum allowed			0
" they can not just keep pushing pilots until they drop , " said the head of the @entity78 , @entity79			1
he said during a break in the @entity9 hearing that " pilot pushing " is an issue			2
" we are in tough economic times , we 're being asked to do more with less , and we have to support the pilot when he makes the determination that it 's time to call it quits , " he said			0
after reviewing some possible remedies against fatigue in the cockpit , board members unanimously approved the proposal to the @entity6 , which would be responsible for developing guidance for the airlines to carry out			0
the @entity6 plans to hold a symposium on fatigue management next week with representatives from the aviation industry			1
" i want the @entity6 to have a complete overhaul of the flight time / duty time regulations " that presently allow a 14 - hour day with eight hours of flight time , @entity102 said .			1

@entity6 currently allows pilots to work a 14 - hour day
@entity9 said pilot fatigue has contributed to plane **crashes** and near - **crashes**
" they ca n't just keep pushing pilots until they drop , " pilots group president said
