-- one of the nurses duped by a prank phone call about @entity3 , apparently committed suicide on friday , and many social media users were quick to point fingers at the two radio hosts who made the call and then promoted it on @entity10			1
@entity12 radio station @entity11 posted audio of the call on its @entity10 page wednesday with the caption , " listen to the prank that the world is talking about			1
can you believe @entity20 and @entity21 got away with these dodgy accents ? " the hashtag # royalprank was retweeted more than 15,000 times on @entity25 after the radio station began promoting the call			1
it continued to be used after news of the nurse 's death			1
@entity3 , the pregnant wife of @entity33 's @entity32 , had been hospitalized with severe morning sickness			1
the prank became worldwide news as the nurse , believing the @entity38 were @entity39 and prince @entity40 , forwarded the call to a second nurse who eventually revealed details of the former @entity3 's condition			1
concerns over privacy and the media , which had surfaced in @entity48 during the @entity50 scandal and again when topless photos taken of @entity3 were published , were quickly reignited			2
but prince @entity40 himself joked about the incident after being contacted by the radio station			1
news of the prank was also widely shared on social networks , with at least 5,000 links created and shared between tuesday and thursday			0
at the time , royal commentator @entity59 said he did not believe the radio call had been intended as a serious invasion of privacy			1
the hospital identified the nurse as @entity65			1
as news of her death spread , commenters flooded the @entity70			1
a user named @entity72 posted , " shame for still having this sick call on website ! ! shame on the djs and shame on the radio station			1
" at 10:54 a.m. et , 700 comments had been posted since wednesday			0
by 11:15 a.m. et , the number had risen to more than 1,100 and was still growing rapidly			0
the facebook page @entity81 , also used to promote the two djs , did not have a post about the prank , but that did n't stop people from commenting there			1
the @entity11 posts , including the audio of the prank , were deleted by 11:41 a.m. although it is unclear what scrutiny @entity92 had been under since the prank , the hospital said in a statement that it had been supporting her			1
neither police nor the hospital had publicly blamed the radio station for @entity92 's death			1
but on saturday the hospital released this statement : " @entity102 's @entity101 cares for sick people , and it was extremely foolish of your presenters even to consider trying to lie their way through to one of our patients , let alone actually make the call , " wrote hospital chairman @entity100			1
management 's decision then to broadcast the recorded call " was truly appalling , " said @entity100 in the letter addressed to @entity113 , chairman of @entity114 , which owns the radio station			1
" the immediate consequence of these premeditated and ill - considered actions was the humiliation of two dedicated and caring nurses who were simply doing their job tending to their patients			0
" the longer term consequence has been reported around the world and is , frankly , tragic beyond words			0
" lord @entity100 called on the radio station to take steps " to ensure that such an incident could never be repeated			2
" at @entity133 , a spokesman said , " the @entity134 and @entity3 are deeply saddened to learn of the death of @entity65			2
" the @entity25 account for radio host @entity137 ( @ @entity138 ) had included five updates about the prank on friday morning			2
by 11:22 a.m. , the account had been deleted			2
the account for co-host @entity81 ( @ @entity143 ) was also deleted			2
the station and its parent company , @entity114 released the following : " chief executive officer @entity147 has spoken with the presenters , they are both deeply shocked and at this time we have agreed that they not comment about the circumstances			0
@entity114 and the hosts have decided that they will not return to their radio show until further notice out of respect for what can only be described as a tragedy			1
" the full statement was also posted to the @entity10 page and in one hour received more than 4,400 comments and 234 shares			1
one comment linked to an online petition to fire @entity81 and @entity162			0
at the time of this writing it had received 1,985 online signatures from around the world			0
the introduction states , " journalists should be held to higher standards			0
" but there were also calls for a step back from the immediate tragedy			0
" do you know why patriots like myself defend this kind of speech until my dying breath ? " posted a @entity0 commenter			0
" to find that answer , ask yourself this : who decides what kind of speech is appropriate or inappropriate ? who decides what kind of speech is offensive or not ? what if you have the power to decide ? at what point does an opinion that differs from yours become offensive to you ? and what will be the penalty for my supposed offense ? " we can never afford to go down the road if defining right speech from wrong speech			0
it throws everything else into doubt and opens the doorway for tyrants and the fringe to persecute those who are not like minded			0
" the nurse , for whatever personal reasons she might have clearly over-reacted			2
but that is all it is			0
nobody should be prosecuted or penalized over this			0
" others fired back , arguing that not all speech is protected and that no one has immunity from the negative effects of reckless actions			0
still others said the discussion was pointless , since " @entity12 does not have explicit freedom of speech in any constitutional or statutory declaration of rights " another @entity0 commenter offered this : " let us also remember that she was not a native @entity48 speaker - she was front line reception at a major international private hospital where ability in many languages is the priority , and those calling may be all of stressed , powerful , and arrogant - not people to be called upon to give references before being given assistance			0
and that could not have been changed simply because a @entity33 royal was in the building			0
so the supposed point of the " prank " - @entity12 xenophobic mockery of an @entity48 accent - was actually a gross exhibition of cruel racism in a world far larger than they could apparently imagine , on top of a gross breach of medical privacy , data protection , and journalistic ethics , which the radio station should never have allowed , and no one should have re-broadcast			2
" " here 's a social experiment for you , " wrote @entity260 on the @entity81 page			2
" try treating people with common decency and respect			0
