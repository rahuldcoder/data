-- it may not be an " @entity4 , " but @entity2 is far from happy with the summer box office			1
where are all the blockbusters ? summer is supposed to be @entity2 's version of the @entity10 shopping season , but " transformers : @entity4 " was the first movie of the year to record a $ 100 million three - day opening weekend , and overall , the box office is down nearly 20 % compared with last year			1
@entity0 's complete summer entertainment guide that comparison is one reason studio executives are reaching for the antacids			1
@entity19 , senior media analyst at @entity20 , cautions that 2013 is a hard act to follow			2
" when you have a film kicking off the summer of 2013 like ' @entity25 ' with $ 174.1 million , and this year we kick off the summer with ' @entity27 ' with $ 91.6 million , that 's a pretty big discrepancy , " @entity19 noted			1
" @entity25 " wound up grossing $ 409 million at the domestic box office last year , with " @entity29 " adding $ 368 million			1
in all , seven films topped the $ 200 million mark last summer			1
this summer has seen just three : " x-men : @entity33 , " " @entity34 " and " @entity27			2
" of course , some things are beyond @entity2 's control , like the calendar			0
" having the @entity38 actually land on a friday did n't help things : when you have people outside watching fireworks on the second - biggest moviegoing day of the week , that 's not good for business , " @entity19 said			0
the holiday weekend also featured the latest example of a disturbing trend : the second - weekend slump			0
historically , most films do n't drop much more than 50 % in their sophomore frames , but " transformers : @entity4 " fell more than 60 %			2
so did " x-men : @entity33 , " " @entity27 " and " @entity53			0
" that 's led to a revolving door of no. 1 movies : " @entity51 " is the first film of the year to spend more than one weekend as box office champ since " captain america : the winter soldier " in april			1
2013 did have a few high - profile , big - budget flops , observes @entity63			2
@entity2 has n't suffered through an " after @entity64 " or a " @entity65 " this year			2
but plenty of 2014 films have failed to meet expectations , such as the well - reviewed @entity70 action flick " @entity71			2
" " it 's over $ 300 million worldwide , so @entity70 is still a movie star worldwide , but in @entity73 , even @entity70 could n't get a number one debut , " as " edge " fell to the teen weeper " @entity78 , " @entity19 recalled			1
" @entity81 " has also failed to soar as high as expected , despite not much competition for family audiences			0
indeed , @entity19 says that lack of competition may have reduced the demand for " @entity85			0
" " moviegoing begets more moviegoing , right ? so if you have more product out there , it gets people enthused , it gets families enthused about going out to the movie theater , and when you do n't have a lot of family films there , it kind of slows that momentum down , " he explained			0
and there 's not much relief on the horizon : " @entity106 " figures to take over the top spot from " transformers " this weekend , and @entity63 sees " @entity102 : anarchy " and " @entity109 " as other summer bright spots , but none of them figures to help @entity2 dig out of this hole			1
in fact , the summer movies that have everyone talking are next summer 's expected hits : the " @entity119 " reboot , " @entity120 v. @entity121 , " " @entity122 " and " @entity123 , " with " @entity118 : @entity126 " following in december , have studio execs wishing the calendar read 2015 already			1
but @entity19 has n't given up on this summer just yet			0
" if you put a big movie into the marketplace , market it well , get that buzz going , you can have big box office , " he said			1
" this could all turn around almost overnight			0
all we need is two or three movies to perform well beyond expectations , and it could turn this around			0
" your move , @entity2			0
@entity139 , special to @entity0 , contributed to this report .			0

summer is usually a time of blockbuster *successes* , but summer 2014 has seen a shift
box office figures are down nearly 20 % from 2013
" @entity51 " is first movie to have repeat no. 1 weekends since " @entity151 " in april
only three movies have broken $ 200 million , compared with seven last year
