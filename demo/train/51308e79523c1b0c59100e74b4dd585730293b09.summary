-- " this is a man without a core , a man without substance , a man that will say anything to become president of the @entity7			1
" @entity8 uttered these harsh words when describing @entity10 eight months ago			1
but then , four months later , @entity8 endorsed @entity10			1
is @entity8 correct ? is @entity10 truly a man " without a core " ? the simple answer : no. @entity10 has a distinct core -- not that of a politician , but of a ceo			1
what do i mean ? we have become accustomed in these highly partisan times to politicians who adhere rigidly to their ideological positions			0
they do n't change their views to attract supporters			0
rather , they want voters to agree with the positions they advocate			0
in contrast , a ceo is not shackled by ideology			1
a ceo 's success is measured by the bottom line , not by how many principles he or she sticks to			0
to the ceo , if a product is not selling , you do n't stick with it until the product destroys your business			1
instead , you tweak it			0
you try a new slogan or new packaging			0
and if people are still not buying it , like @entity47 , you drop it			0
you regroup , come up with a new product and then start selling again			0
@entity10 is first and foremost a businessman			1
in fact , @entity10 has repeatedly made this very point to us with statements like : " i spent my life in the private sector , not in government			1
i only spent four years as a governor			0
i 'm a business guy			0
" i 'm not defending @entity10 's acrobatic flips on issues			1
in fact , if @entity10 loses this election , he would make a great circus performer			1
i can see the ads : " @entity65 -- he can change positions in midair			0
" at times , i truly wonder if @entity10 realizes we have @entity70 and can look up his record on issues			1
but @entity10 's " evolution " on certain key issues does not technically constitute a " flip - flop , " which is defined by @entity76 as , " a sudden or unexpected reversal as of direction , belief , attitude or policy			1
" @entity10 's changing views are neither sudden nor unexpected			1
rather , they are astutely calculated by @entity10 the businessman to appeal to the customers he 's targeting at that very moment			1
this is a man clearly driven by the adage : " the customer is always right			0
" for example , this week @entity10 declared that the individual mandate imposed by @entity92 is a tax			2
yet when @entity10 was the governor of @entity94 , he implemented an identical individual mandate but consistently denied it was a tax			2
@entity10 has simply modified his " product line " to attract the most customers based on the current marketplace conditions			1
even " @entity103 's " @entity100 would have to be in awe of @entity10 's business acumen			2
this strategy is even more apparent when you contrast @entity10 's views from when he ran for office in @entity94 with those he espoused when seeking the @entity109 presidential nomination			2
in @entity94 , @entity10 fashioned a product that appealed to the left - leaning consumers who populate the state			1
but when seeking to sell his wares to the more conservative @entity109 primary market , he customized it accordingly			0
for example , on abortion , @entity10 was unequivocally pro-choice in his run for the @entity119 in 1994 and for governor in 2002			2
in fact , during a 2002 gubernatorial debate , @entity10 stated , " i will preserve and protect a woman 's right to choose and am devoted and dedicated to honoring my word in that regard			2
" but when @entity10 sought the @entity109 nomination , he tweaked his goods to appeal to these right - leaning buyers by saying , " i support the reversal of @entity131			2
" on gun control , @entity10 admitted during his 1994 @entity119 race that his views were , " ... not going to make me the hero of the @entity136			2
" indeed , as governor , @entity10 signed into law a ban on assault weapons , dubbing them " instruments of destruction with the sole purpose of hunting down and killing people			2
" flash forward to 2012			0
during the @entity109 primaries , @entity10 again fine - tuned his merchandise to attract the more conservative gun owners			0
in april , he even addressed the @entity136 's national convention , explaining , " we need a president who will enforce current laws , not create new ones that only serve to burden lawful gun owners			0
" @entity10 not only revamped his product line , he also repackaged himself			1
during his 1994 @entity119 campaign , @entity10 told @entity94 voters , " i 'm not trying to return to @entity157			0
" but when running for the @entity109 presidential nomination , he shrewdly rebranded himself as a self - described " @entity159			0
" for many , a ceo - style president could be a good fit			0
@entity10 's track record indicates he will likely be a pragmatic leader , not rigidly beholden to ideology			1
but for others like myself , @entity10 's ceo core and ever evolving product line lead to doubt about every word he says			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172 .			0

@entity172 : is @entity10 truly a man " without a core " ? no.
@entity172 : @entity10 has a distinct core -- not one of a politician , but one of a ceo
he says a ceo is not shackled by ideology , but by how well he can sell a product
@entity172 : romney the businessman modifies his messages to get the customers
