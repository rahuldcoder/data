-- @entity1 sits at the defense table , awaiting his fate , looking like an old man waiting for a bus			1
most defendants , certainly those facing such serious charges , try to create a good impression for jurors , donning suit and tie and looking for all and sundry a respectable guy			2
but each day at his trial in a federal courthouse named for a congressman that was his neighbor in @entity18 , 83 - year - old @entity1 dons the suit of an @entity20 : jeans , white sneakers , a simple shirt			2
he is an @entity20 charged in 19 murders , and with terrorizing @entity18 , holding the city 's psyche hostage , aided and abetted by the @entity27 , for which he served as an informant for some 15 years			2
he insists he was n't an informant despite an overwhelming public record that shows he was one , including more than 700 pages of information he fed to a disgraced and now imprisoned @entity27 agent , @entity34 , who grew up in the same housing project in a neighborhood known as @entity37			1
in @entity18 , loyalty was everything			0
loyalty to family , to friends , to neighbors , to neighborhood			2
it was an @entity45 thing , in an @entity45 neighborhood			2
@entity1 exploited that obsession with loyalty , expecting loyalty from everyone else , delivering it to no one but himself			1
as @entity1 's trial hurtles toward the end of its seventh week , his attorneys have spent as much time disputing something he is not even charged with -- being an @entity27 informant -- as they have challenging a sweeping indictment that accuses @entity1 of being a vicious and venal overlord of @entity37 , using murder and intimidation to control a small but lucrative gang that made millions by shaking down bookmakers , drug dealers , and , when @entity1 realized the @entity27 really had his back , legitimate business people			1
@entity1 's lawyers have also spent considerable time disputing charges that he strangled two women , @entity69 and @entity70 , the girlfriend and stepdaughter of his partner in crime , @entity75			1
they are doing what their client wants , and their client knows he is not going to be acquitted of all charges			0
in letters that my colleague @entity80 and i obtained for our book , " @entity1 : @entity87 and the manhunt that brought him to @entity90 , " @entity1 revealed an obsession with rehabilitating an image he spent his entire criminal life constructing			2
that is the image of the good bad guy , the wiseguy with scruples			1
the wiseguy who picked up mrs. @entity96 , the mother of the future congressman , and brought her home and carried her groceries upstairs			0
but wiseguys with scruples do n't rat on their friends , and they certainly do n't murder defenseless women and bury them in secret graves			2
this is history unfolding in @entity18 , where @entity1 is firmly established not only as the city 's most famous criminal but one of its most infamous citizens , and other citizens have been lining up at dawn to catch a glimpse of a man whose grandfatherly demeanor masks a legacy drenched in blood and secret , shallow graves			1
but it 's also a history lesson in that the @entity18 where @entity1 prospered in is gone			1
the blue - collar people he grew up with and then exploited have been priced out of the condos and sprawling three - deckers in @entity18 by yuppies who have nothing in common with @entity1 and his ilk			2
the ethnic dynamic that led the @entity27 to cut deals with vicious @entity45 gangsters such as @entity1 , all in a myopic dash to get the @entity129 , is gone			1
there is no @entity45 mob in @entity18 anymore			2
the @entity129 , meanwhile , is a pathetic shell of itself , a handful of " @entity135 " wannabes , reduced to sports betting and the odd drug deal , which always gets them caught			0
the state created the lottery to take over the mob 's real moneymaker , the number			0
the biggest bookie in the state is the state			0
at the @entity148 , named for the guy whose mother @entity1 used to drive home , the gallery was taken aback when @entity152 , @entity1 's lead counsel , copped to most of the indictment in his opening statement			1
he admitted his client was a bookmaker , an extortionist , even a drug trafficker			0
that last admission was a shocker because @entity1 and his apologists , including his politically connected family , had long insisted he would never profit from drugs , that he in fact kept drugs out of @entity37			2
there was a method to what @entity1 's few remaining sycophants would consider the madness of admitting to shaking down drug dealers who peddled poison to the neighborhood			1
@entity1 's reasoning is pretty obvious : if he admits to all these terrible crimes , why not believe him when he says he did n't kill the women and he was n't a rat ? the problem for @entity1 is that the prosecution has done a good job showing that he was a vainglorious gangster for whom reputation was everything , that his family , including younger brother @entity182 , the longest serving president of the @entity183 , was invested in maintaining the myth of @entity1 as benevolent criminal			1
@entity1 ca n't bear the thought that he will die and the narrative he spent so many years honing will be written by those who brought him to justice			2
he drove mrs. @entity96 and all the other old ladies in the projects home and carried their groceries up the stairs , damn it			0
ca n't everybody see that ? the @entity45 consciousness is littered with the betrayal of the informer			0
in his letters from jail that @entity80 and i obtained , @entity1 said he felt like @entity204 , the noble protagonist in @entity206 's short story " @entity208 , " cast to sea because he challenged his government			1
but @entity1 is actually more like @entity210 , the protagonist from @entity212 's great story " @entity216 , " about a man who gave up his friend and lived to regret it			1
the prosecution , expected to wrap up within days , has produced a parade of witnesses that include alleged victims of @entity1 's violence and a posse of his former criminal confederates , all of whom have cut sweet deals for themselves in exchange for their testimony against @entity1			1
@entity230 , an admitted murder of 20 , served just 12 years , in cushy conditions			0
in return , he implicated @entity182 in 11 murders			0
he was a repulsive , if effective , witness			0
@entity235 , @entity1 's protege and gravedigger , did just five years for his involvement in a half - dozen murders			1
when @entity235 referred to his mentor as a rat , @entity1 's nice old man veil dropped			1
" you suck ! " @entity1 hissed			0
" f * * k you , " @entity235 replied			0
" f * * k you , too , " @entity1 said			0
this from a guy who bragged that he read @entity247 and @entity248 in prison			0
while the exchange reduced the @entity18 courtroom to a @entity37 locker room , @entity1 's attorneys were pleased , thinking it made @entity255 look like a thug , which he is			1
but where did he learn all this ? at the knee of @entity1			0
that has been the defense 's burden			2
every time they succeed in showing @entity1 's former partners in crime as craven , vicious people they simply reinforce the notion that @entity1 was in charge of them all			1
lately , it 's been @entity75 , @entity1 's opposite number , who has held center stage			1
he is 79 , hard of hearing , but he has a pretty good memory			0
he is a degenerate , an admitted murderer of 10 , including his girlfriend @entity280 and his stepdaughter @entity281			0
of course , he admitted it but took no responsibility , blaming @entity1 , saying he went along with the plots to kill them because @entity1 pressured him into it			0
and , @entity75 insisted , it was @entity1 who strangled them , while he just watched			0
again , as defense attorneys picked at @entity75 's flaws , including his sexual abuse of his own stepdaughter , it only served to highlight the company @entity1 kept			1
these are his buds , his homeys , and he will live with them and most likely he will die with them , except like @entity75 he will be in prison			0
if he does , he 'll make out better than @entity210 , who was shot dead , like so many of @entity1 's alleged victims			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity305 .			0

@entity305 : @entity1 's worst fear is to be called in an informant
@entity305 : public record shows he was a rat , but loyalty , above all else , is the @entity45 code
@entity305 : @entity1 obsessed with being the good bad guy , who helped old ladies with groceries
defense burden : his friends are vile , murdering thugs , and he was in charge , @entity305 says
