-- in the marshland just south of the seaside - resort of @entity4 in @entity5 , the air is often filled with birdsong and the croak of tiny frogs			1
but added to nature 's chorus is the sound of construction , something difficult to escape along @entity5 's @entity14			1
@entity4 is still being built and the marshlands are being drained to make way for new five - star hotels			0
a new railway and airport are planned as the government aims to bring back the tourists who used to come to @entity4 during @entity23 times			0
but there are bigger plans than that			0
@entity5 's president @entity27 wants to build a whole new city called @entity29			1
the promotional video for it presents an impression of futuristic skyscrapers , golf courses and high - end luxury for the entrepreneurs who will make this city their home			0
@entity29 will be a new port on @entity5 's @entity14 coast and a special economic zone where businesses can operate under @entity45 law			1
rather than attract businesses to established cities the government feels it 's easier to start from scratch			2
" if we want to be exceptional and if we want to create this hub economy , a place for the rest of the world to come and invest in @entity5 , then we have to be creative , " says @entity51 , @entity5 's 28 - year - old economy minister			1
" and @entity29 is being very creative			2
" and all this in five years , according to @entity57 who admits that there are currently no international investors in the project " but we do have international interest			0
" many local residents are enthusiastic as @entity29 would mean jobs for a community that struggles to make a living through agriculture			2
but just 20 kilometers ( 12 miles ) south is @entity68 , @entity5 's main port that others believe should be revived before a new city is built			1
currently the area is sparsely populated and @entity5 has a population of around 4.5 million , begging the question ' where will the 500,000 future @entity29 residents come from ? ' president @entity27 is a man who operates at breakneck speed and is quick to defend @entity29			1
" we are looking for a new destination not for the sake of spending lots of money like some other governments have done just to show off , " he says			0
" we only look at it as a way to generate more income , more goods , more services			0
" @entity27 it seems is a man who thrives on projects and it 's easy to imagine some falling by the wayside , although the country has been transformed since he came to power in 2003			2
the @entity14 resort of @entity96 has turned from a warlord 's paradise into a bustling tourist town where @entity100 is the latest to invest and the country 's parliament building has been moved from its traditional home in the capital @entity105 to a futuristic new government building in @entity107 yet behind the construction boom @entity5 's economic fundamentals remain difficult			1
unemployment hovers at 16 % and poverty is still widespread			1
projects like @entity29 sound wonderful but it may have to be seen to be believed			0
@entity0 's eye on series often carries sponsorship originating from the countries we profile			0
however @entity0 retains full editorial control over all of its reports			0
