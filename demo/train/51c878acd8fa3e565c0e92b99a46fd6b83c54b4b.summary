-- gay basketball star @entity1 has criticized the head of soccer 's ruling body for his comments about homosexuals planning to attend the @entity7 in @entity8			1
@entity10 president @entity9 was unable to keep a straight face when asked at a press conference in @entity13 what to advise gay people who hope to go to the @entity17 emirate			1
the mainly @entity19 country , which will host the tournament for the first time , forbids same - sex relationships by law			0
" i would say that they should refrain from sexual activities , " @entity9 answered on monday , after a long pause			1
" we are living in a world of freedom and when the @entity7 will be in @entity8 , this will be in 2022			1
and you can see in the @entity32 the opening of this culture			0
it is another culture because it is another religion , but in football we have no boundaries			0
" however , @entity1 -- who became the first @entity40 basketballer to reveal he is gay after retiring in 2007 -- accused the 74 - year - old @entity9 of showing " archaic , @entity42 ignorance " towards the world 's lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender community			1
blog : has @entity10 gambled with @entity7 decisions ? " the statements and the position adopted by @entity9 and @entity10 regarding @entity56 fans who would pay the enormous ticket and travel prices to attend the @entity7 in 2022 should have been wholly unacceptable a decade ago , " the @entity51 - born @entity50 citizen wrote on his website			1
" instead , with little more than an afterthought , @entity10 has endorsed the marginalization of @entity56 people around the world			2
if sport can not serve to change society , even temporarily during the duration of an event like the @entity7 , then it is little more than grown men chasing a ball and we should treat it as such			2
" @entity1 said @entity9 's comments were more damaging than they may have appeared at face value			2
" @entity9 's words are n't really about sex , as i ca n't imagine that many gay football fans would be bold enough to do it in public in @entity8			1
rather , what he is really saying is ' do n't be camp , do n't hold hands , do n't look into each other 's eyes , do n't book rooms with one bed , do n't have candle - lit dinners in the restaurant ... ' and on and on , " he said			0
" he 's really saying do n't even ' look ' gay , re-closet yourself and pretend the ties and love and affection you have for your partner or even some random bloke you might meet on your travels are gone for the whole time you are in @entity8			1
" @entity8 : from obscure desert kingdom to @entity7 host however , @entity9 insisted that gay people would have no such problems in @entity8 in 2022			1
" i think there shall not be any discrimination against any human beings on this side or that side -- or left or right or whatever , " he told reporters			0
" and we do n't want to have any discrimination			0
so you can be assured that ... if people want to watch a match in 2022 i am sure they will be admitted to such matches			0
" what we want to do is open this game to all people to all cultures , and this is what we are doing in 2022			0
" @entity7 nets $ 509 million for @entity13 @entity9 was in @entity13 to launch a legacy trust of $ 100 million to be distributed in the country after it became the first on the continent to host a @entity7 earlier this year			1
of that , $ 80 million will go to social community projects while the rest was given to the @entity128 in the build - up to the tournament			2
" when i arrived back in @entity13 , i saw excited people shouting , ' welcome back , welcome back '			2
this to me shows that the spirit of the @entity7 is still alive in this country , " @entity9 said			1
" now we go to the @entity136 to @entity137 where the @entity7 has never been			0
later on , we go to the @entity32			0
the @entity7 must go to where it can improve social conditions and make a difference			0
" from the @entity13 tourism minister , we learned that over 300,000 people came to @entity13 for the @entity7			2
this , in turn , has been a major boost for the @entity13 economy			0

@entity10 president advises gay soccer fans traveling to @entity8 to refrain from sexual activities
homosexuality is *illegal* in the @entity17 emirate , which will host the @entity7 in 2022
@entity156 's first openly gay player accuses @entity9 of " archaic ignorance "
