@entity1 gov. @entity0 on friday declared a drought emergency for the state , saying it is facing " perhaps the worst drought that @entity1 has ever seen since records about 100 years ago			1
" the governor 's announcement , made in @entity9 , came as a wildfire burned friday with only 30 % containment in 1,700 acres of foothills of @entity13 near @entity14			1
an illegal campfire apparently ignited the wildfire , and fire officials cited drought conditions as contributing to the blaze			1
in his declaration , the governor called for voluntary " 20 % conservation of our water use " statewide			1
" it 's important to wake all @entity26 to the serious matter of the drought and lack of rain , " @entity0 told reporters			1
" we are in an unprecedented , very serious situation that people should pause and reflect on how dependent we are on the rain , nature and one other			0
" this is an effort to call for arms , " he continued			0
" that 's the point of the declaration			2
" @entity0 said he would set into motion an initiative that would make water transfers easier between regions in the state			2
the snowpack in @entity1 's mountains is at 20 % of normal levels			1
the state 's largest water reservoirs are below record lows , and the major waterways , including the @entity52 and the @entity54 rivers , flow with " significantly reduced " water			1
since 2011 , extremely dry conditions have parched the state			2
under the proclamation , @entity0 directed officials to take " all necessary actions " to address the drought , including assisting farmers and communities with water shortages			2
he directed state agencies to use less water and hire more firefighters			2
ninety percent of @entity1 is in a severe drought , @entity69 meteorologist @entity68 said			1
" this could be a giant fire year coming up , " @entity68 added			1
meanwhile , about 800 firefighting personnel brought a @entity13 - area wildfire under some control friday , with 30 % containment -- an improvement over 0 % a day earlier			1
" i 've seen the sky turn gray from smoke before during fires here in @entity13 , but this red sun was more eery than others , " said @entity78 from about a 20 - minute drive away			2
" i could also smell the fire and my eyes started to sting			0
" about 3,600 people at one point were ordered to evacuate , though that number had fallen to about 1,600 as of late thursday night , according to @entity93 's update on the @entity95 's website			0
the number of evacuees fell even further friday , when police in the inland @entity1 city of @entity101 announced that select residents could return to their homes at 4 p.m. ( 7 p.m. et )			1
residents of @entity105 in that city , however , were not being let back in due to continued " concern for the roadway and homes in that area			0
" meanwhile , a red flag warning was extended to friday because of anticipated warm , dry breezes called @entity115 winds , @entity111 said			0
the blaze began before dawn thursday and allegedly originated with three men camping in the foothills near @entity14 , authorities said			0
the campers were tossing paper into a campfire , and a gust of wind spread embers , authorities said			0
the three men , all in their early 20s , were arrested on suspicion of recklessly starting a fire , said police chief @entity129 of @entity14			1
one man is from @entity14 and another is from @entity131 , he said			0
the third man 's home was not known			1
bail was set thursday at $ 20,000 for each			0
" the way it 's told to us is that all three of them were together at the time , sitting around this campfire , " he said			0
" @entity141 kicked up , and that 's what caused this fire			2
" it 's not a camping area , but people do camp up in the hills above @entity14 , " @entity129 said			0
the arrests were made after authorities received a call that at least two people were suspiciously walking away from the fire , the chief said			0
the three men arrested were identified as @entity154 , 23 ; @entity156 , 22 ; and @entity157 , 21 , police said			0
they and their attorneys could n't be reached for comment			0
the wildfire , named the @entity163 , destroyed two homes and injured one person thursday morning , @entity13 fire chief @entity161 said			2
the injured civilian suffered minor burns , @entity161 told reporters			0
" we predicted that this is going to be an intense fire season because this is the third year of an ongoing drought , " he said			1
there has n't been a fire in @entity14 's foothills since 1968 , so the area has lots of brush and other fuel for a wildfire , authorities said .			1

some in @entity101 can return home , other wildfire evacuees can not , police say
