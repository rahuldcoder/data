@entity0 -- @entity3 's lower house of parliament overwhelmingly approved a treaty thursday to annex the @entity7 peninsula of @entity8 from @entity9 , prompting tougher sanctions from the @entity11			1
@entity3 responded with its own sanctions against a list of @entity11 officials and lawmakers			1
after @entity3 foreign minister @entity17 had presented the treaty and urged lawmakers to accept the region as a part of the @entity3 , the document was approved on a vote of 443 to 1			1
speaking " on behalf " of @entity22 , @entity17 had told the @entity23 that folding @entity8 into @entity3 was needed to protect ethnic @entity3 there			2
" i am certain that passing the document will become a turning point in the destiny of multi-ethnic nations of @entity8 and @entity3 , who are related with close ties of the historical unity , " @entity17 said			2
the political crisis has been the biggest blow to @entity3 's relations with the @entity34 since the @entity35			2
approval of the treaty in the @entity23 was in no doubt as @entity3 has stood defiant despite @entity34 leaders denouncing @entity41 's actions as a violation of @entity9 's sovereignty and a breach of international law			1
@entity47 leaders said thursday they will sign a political association agreement with @entity9 and add 12 more people to the list of individuals targeted for sanctions , including @entity3 's deputy prime minister @entity53			1
@entity47 member states also are threatening possible tougher targeted measures , @entity55 president @entity54 told reporters			0
" we make clear that failure to settle the crisis peacefully , and any steps by @entity3 to destabilize @entity9 , will have far reaching consequences , " he said			2
" and by that we mean consequences on relations in a broad range of economic areas			0
" @entity11 and @entity47 officials had already imposed sanctions on more than two dozen @entity3 and @entity8 officials , and urged @entity3 to avoid escalating the crisis -- a call @entity41 has ignored			1
but @entity11 president @entity74 on thursday announced more sanctions on individuals and one bank in response to @entity3 's annexation moves			1
he also signed a new executive order that authorizes possible further sanctions on what he called " key sectors " of the @entity3 economy if @entity41 does not act to deescalate the situation			1
" this is not our preferred outcome			0
these sanctions would not only have a significant impact on the @entity3 economy , but could also be disruptive to the global economy , " he said			2
" however @entity3 must know that further escalation will only isolate it further from the international community			0
" @entity3 must respect " basic principles " of sovereignty and territorial integrity , he said , adding that the @entity11 should also provide financial support for @entity9 's government and people			1
" we want the @entity9 people to determine their own destiny and have good relations with the @entity11 , @entity3 , @entity105 -- anyone they choose , " he said , calling for continued diplomatic efforts			1
sanctions lists the new @entity11 sanctions target 20 officials , including senior @entity3 and " cronies " who hold significant influence in the @entity3 system , as well as one bank that holds " significant " resources , a senior @entity11 administration official told reporters			1
that bank was listed by the @entity119 as @entity120			2
the individuals named by the @entity119 include major @entity22 allies , both in the @entity123 and in business			0
among the 16 government officials listed are @entity22 's chief of staff , @entity127 ; the speaker of the @entity23 , @entity129 ; and @entity130 , chairman of the @entity132 of the @entity3 parliament 's upper house			1
four others were named as members of the government 's inner circle			0
they are financier @entity140 , labeled @entity22 's personal banker by a senior @entity11 administration official ; magnate @entity143 , whose activities in the energy sector have been directly linked to @entity22 , according to the @entity119 ; and businessmen @entity147 and @entity146			1
besides @entity3 's deputy prime minister @entity53 , the expanded @entity47 sanctions target list includes two advisors to president @entity22 , @entity152 and @entity153 , as well as the chairwoman of the @entity3 senate @entity155			1
@entity158 foreign minister @entity157 told @entity1 's @entity159 that the new round of @entity11 sanctions would be " significantly more powerful than the first one			1
" the latest round " hits significant economic interests that are fairly close to the ruling circles in @entity41			0
it will be noticed , " he said			0
@entity3 responded with sanctions against nine @entity11 officials and lawmakers , including speaker of the @entity173 @entity172 , senate majority leader @entity174 and sens. @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 and @entity178 , according to a list published by the @entity180			1
@entity172 's spokesman , @entity181 , said the lawmaker was " proud to be included on a list of those willing to stand against @entity22 's aggression			0
" @entity175 responded , " i guess this means my spring break in @entity188 is off , my @entity190 stock is lost , and my secret bank account in @entity41 is frozen			0
nonetheless , i will never cease my efforts on behalf of the freedom , independence , and territorial integrity of @entity9 , including @entity8			2
" the @entity119 said @entity120 is controlled by @entity140 and is the 17th - largest bank in @entity3			1
it has $ 10 billion in assets and handles the accounts of some top government officials , the @entity119 said , adding that the bank has relationships with banks in the @entity11 , @entity105 , and elsewhere			1
the bank also provides services to the oil , gas and energy sectors , it said			0
" as a result of @entity119 's action , any assets of the persons designated today that are within @entity11 jurisdiction must be frozen , " the @entity119 said			1
@entity214 prime minister @entity213 told reporters at the @entity216 there would likely be more asset freezes and travel bans			0
@entity221 's minister for european affairs and @entity222 told @entity1 more names would be added thursday			0
" there will probably be over 10 new names on the list and then of course people are going to argue , are these people good to be on the list , bad to be on the list are they to be taken seriously and so on , but there will be more names , " @entity224 said			0
@entity17 told lawmakers that sanctions " have never brought any positive results " and that there were no legal grounds for them			0
@entity0 defiant @entity3 's defense minister assured @entity11 defense secretary @entity242 in phone call thursday that @entity3 troops on the @entity9 border do not intend to cross the border or take aggressive action , @entity240 spokesman rear adm. @entity239 said			1
@entity248 made it clear in the lengthy and sometimes " direct " talk with @entity3 defense minister @entity250 that the @entity3 bear responsibility for what happens in @entity8 , including the recent violence , since they are in control there , @entity239 said			1
while @entity3 insists its actions are legitimate , @entity9 's parliament said thursday that @entity0 will never stop fighting for @entity8 , even if the country 's new leaders have discussed evacuating military personnel from the region			1
in a declaration published online , the @entity0 parliament said " @entity8 was , is and will be part of @entity9			2
" " the @entity9 people will never , under no circumstances , stop fighting for the liberation of @entity8 from the occupants , no matter how hard and long it is			2
" @entity22 announced the annexation of @entity8 after voters in the semi-autonomous territory approved a hastily called weekend referendum on separating from @entity9			2
@entity0 officials unveiled new measures against @entity3 and the " self - proclaimed " authorities in @entity8			1
in a televised briefing , @entity279 , secretary of the national defense and security council , said that if the @entity283 designates @entity8 a " demilitarized zone , " @entity9 is prepared to evacuate its military personnel and family members			1
@entity9 has facilities ready to accommodate 25,000 evacuees			0
a statement on the @entity9 presidential website said former presidents @entity291 and @entity293 had asked @entity294 to redeploy soldiers who are still in @entity8 to the mainland			2
the call was " to protect and save lives of @entity9 servicemen who bear service in difficult and dangerous conditions in @entity8 , " the statement said			2
@entity279 had also said the measures included a full - scale visa system for @entity3			0
speaking in @entity306 on thursday , prime minister @entity305 said @entity0 was in no hurry to impose a visa regime on @entity3 , since it could negatively affect @entity9 living in the predominantly @entity3 - speaking east of the country			1
@entity305 is in @entity306 to sign the political part of an association agreement with the @entity47			0
@entity17 said the intention to introduce visa regulations was " surprising and regrettable			0
" as diplomatic efforts to resolve the crisis continue , @entity283 @entity314 ban ki - moon traveled to @entity3 thursday , where he met @entity22 and @entity17			0
he will then head to @entity0 where he will meet acting @entity9 president @entity294 and @entity305 on friday			0
@entity3 's @entity318 news agency quoted @entity314 as saying during a meeting with @entity22 that he was " deeply concerned " by the situation involving @entity9 and @entity3			2

they took away @entity9 navy chief @entity335			0
@entity294 issued a 9 p.m. ( 3 p.m. et ) deadline for @entity8 to release all hostages and stop all provocations			0

a statement on the presidential site said @entity335 and several other hostages had been freed			0
they were released during the night and were on their way to @entity0 thursday			0
@entity3 defense minister @entity250 had asked authorities in @entity8 to free @entity335 and allow him safe passage out of the region			1
