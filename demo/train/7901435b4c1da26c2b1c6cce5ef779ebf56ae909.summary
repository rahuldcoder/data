-- there 's a reason the city of @entity4 looks so inviting on the hit @entity6 show " @entity8			1
" " we film only during the summer so it appears particularly sunny and bright , though i will tell you it is not that way always , " co-creator and co-star of the show @entity12 told @entity0			1
" it 's a pretty special place and there is such fondness for me for the city			0
" the city seems to love @entity12 and her creative partner @entity21 right back , as evidenced by an award they received from one of the travel boards in @entity26			1
after all , they have helped draw plenty of fans with their quirky sketch comedy series , which returns for its third season friday			1
@entity12 recently spoke with @entity0 about the changes fans can expect this season , her dream guest stars and " the hipster method of acting			1
" @entity0 : how will season three of " @entity8 " be different ? @entity12 : first and foremost when we were going into season three we were thinking about other shows and what drew us to those shows and kept us coming back			1
we realized that it was character and developing some type of relationship with a character			0
we realized that we had only introduced characters in the first two seasons , but had n't really explored who they were or that much about their lives or their relationship to the city			1
we really started focusing on the characters in the third season so there will be a deeper exploration of the people on the show			1
i think that definitely makes for a richer and more intriguing season			2
it feels like a more fully actualized show to me now			2
@entity0 : since the series has been so character - driven , have there ever been any characters that you tried but had to abandon ? @entity12 : there have been plenty of one - off characters that have n't worked out , but i could n't even name them now ' cause they are done			1
any character that we have had a fondness for or feel like we can explore are the ones that come back			0
@entity0 : is it at all challenging having a show tied so closely to a specific locale ? it 's as if @entity4 is its own character in the show			2
we 've intentionally made @entity4 a character on the show			2
i like the notion of place in any narrative			0
people 's relationship to where they live , and the idea of an internal landscape that people possess has always been fascinating to me whether it 's in fiction , song writing or in television			0
i love how " @entity98 " and @entity99 are so intrinsically tied			0
i think that in terms of the narrative landscape , really having place be distinct helps define shows			0
so it 's not a challenge			0
i actually think it really grounds the show and provides a reality that we can spring off of			2
@entity110 : @entity12 and her @entity112 band members @entity0 : the show has been very successful in luring a variety of stars to appear in cameo roles ( several celebs including @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 and @entity122 have had bit parts )			1
who are your dream folks that you have n't had on the show yet who you would love to see appear ? @entity12 : a couple years in a row we 've tried to get @entity131 , which is crazy			1
@entity133 , the director , we have tried to get on the show			2
there is always this pie in the sky list , but each and every time i feel happier and luckier with the guest stars that we do get , so i would consider them dream casting as well			0
at the beginning of the year you think you are going to end up with every @entity145 - winning actor or actress and that 's not usually the case			0
@entity0 : why @entity131 ? @entity12 : she 's just so enigmatic			1
when i think of the film " @entity149 " where she plays @entity152 , she just has this kind of boldness about her and she 's very interesting			0
we always kind of want her for a slightly malevolent type of role			0
she 's just a great actress , and we would love to work with her			0
@entity0 : i 've always wanted to see @entity158 on the show			2
@entity12 : you know , we asked him to be on the show			1
a lot of times people want to do it , but it 's scheduling issues and such			0
people are very gracious in declining			0
@entity0 : how long do you envision " @entity8 " going on , because fans would like for it to be on forever			1
@entity12 : @entity170 ! you say that now , but i do n't think it 's true			1
i feel like shows have a time and place			0
i 'd like to think of it as coming to existence , hopefully being something that people are drawn to and feel a connection to and then kind of leaving before we wear out our welcome			2
ideally i think five seasons would be the perfect amount of time " @entity8 " should exist in the world			1
that 's not to be self - defeating ; it just feels like we can tell a story and get to the places we want to get to in terms of writing in that amount of time			0
but you never know whether we are getting another [ season ] or not , so maybe it will be three			2
@entity0 : you and @entity21 [ @entity21 ] recently voiced the characters of @entity199 and @entity200 , a couple from the @entity202 who settle in @entity203 on " @entity204			2
" do you feel like you guys are kind of locked into the hipster method of acting ? @entity12 : hopefully not			1
i 'm not even sure what that is , but i like your description of it that way			0
i just think that " @entity204 " had that episode percolating for awhile , but i do n't think we are limited to just that			0
there was certainly some crossover between " @entity204 " and " @entity8 " that seemed natural .			1

" @entity8 ' returns for its third season on friday
co-creator and star @entity12 says the show will delve into the characters ' lives
she 'd like to see the series get five seasons
