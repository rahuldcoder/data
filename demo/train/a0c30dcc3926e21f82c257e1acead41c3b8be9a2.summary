-- a young boy in @entity2 was among millions in @entity3 who watched the horrifying news this past weekend about the @entity6 that went down in @entity9 's @entity8 province			1
that boy in @entity2 soon found out that his father , a @entity12 pilot , was aboard the doomed helicopter			2
in the midst of his world shattering , he could not understand why the @entity16 drew so much attention			1
there were 30 @entity3 on board that @entity6			2
why was n't anyone mentioning his father , a chief warrant officer with @entity22 , @entity23 , 155th @entity24 ? so he sent in a photograph to @entity0 's @entity26 of his dad , @entity27 , sitting with four of his @entity12 buddies in front of a military aircraft			1
" my father was one of the 30 @entity12 killed in @entity9 yesterday with the @entity16 rescue mission , " he wrote			1
" my father was the pilot of the chinook			0
i have seen other pictures of victims from this deadly mission and wish you would include a picture of my father			0
he is the farthest to the left			0
" he signed his name , @entity41 , said he was from @entity42 and that he was 10 years old			1
in one day , the post was viewed almost 20,000 times			0
@entity27 ' aunt @entity45 of @entity46 , @entity2 , said monday that @entity41 , @entity47 ' only son , was stung by the way the news of the deadly @entity9 incident played out on the airwaves			1
" they always say @entity16			2
they never say my dad , " @entity41 told his family			1
the @entity26 post was the only consolation , perhaps , for a boy who was counting the days before his father came home			1
there were just nine left before @entity27 , 31 , was to fly home to @entity42 for a two - week leave			1
nine days and he would have been back on a motorcycle			0
nine days and @entity41 might have watched a baseball game again with his dad			1
@entity66 shared his excitement about starting fifth grade			0
@entity27 and @entity41 's mother were divorced but father and son were close , @entity45 said			1
when @entity47 remarried , he had a little @entity12 uniform made for @entity41 to wear at the wedding			2
like father , like son			0
the two had stayed in touch via @entity78 since april , when @entity47 was deployed			0
@entity79 missed his dad terribly , @entity45 said			0
a reunion will never take place after the deadliest day for @entity3 in the nearly decade - long @entity9 war			2
@entity45 said @entity47 parents and his wife were at @entity86 to collect the remains tuesday			0
after the funerals , this weekend 's tragedy will begin to fade from @entity3 consciousness			0
but not for a little boy in @entity2 who will grow to manhood without his dad .			0

@entity41 , 10 , sent in a photo of his father to @entity0 's @entity26
his father , @entity27 , was killed when the @entity6 went down in @entity9
@entity41 could n't understand why the @entity16 were *drawing* attention , but not his dad
@entity27 was to have come home on leave in nine days
