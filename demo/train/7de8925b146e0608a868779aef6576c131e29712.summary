-- these days , purveyors of luxury can go beyond owning , eating or imbibing their favorite brand ; they can live it			1
no longer content with selling a mere fraction of the lifestyle experience , an increasing number of high - end luxury companies have decided to open hotels , where their clients can eat , sleep and breathe the brand around the clock			1
@entity15 is the most recent company to join the fray			0
it 's the organization behind global @entity19 restaurant chain @entity20 , and it started taking reservations this past october for the first ever @entity22 , set to open within @entity23 in @entity24 come january 2013			1
soon to follow are locations in @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 and the @entity29			0
food will naturally be a key focus ; the @entity24 hotel will host the company 's largest restaurant , at 12,000 square feet			1
the @entity20 menu will be available from room service 24/7 , and the kitchen ( open for breakfast and lunch ) will offer more products , including green tea waffles and a @entity19 take on bagels and lox			1
mainly , though , the hotel is about increasing the company 's reach			2
" anybody who walks into a @entity20 restaurant , we want to convert for ourselves , " says @entity48 , chief executive at @entity15			1
" once we open , we want it to go the other way around too			0
" read related : business or pleasure ? luxury hotels offer day - only rooms @entity48 says the plan to break into the hotel industry was born simply of the fact that in many of the other hotel chains that boast a @entity20 , the restaurant is a major draw			1
" we realized we were building other hotels ' brands , when what we should be doing is building our own , " he says			0
hotels have become big business for luxury brands of late			2
@entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and @entity75 have all made the transition to an industry that nominally , it would seem they know little about			1
" hotels are a great way to showcase the design identity of a brand , and to project a lifestyle that goes beyond products , " notes @entity79 , the executive vice president of @entity80			2
@entity80 mimics the exclusivity of its design brand by limiting its room count			0
it reminds guests of its history by showcasing a mix of contemporary and classic @entity93 architecture , and by using vintage @entity74 designs to inspire some of the textiles and furnishings			2
guests receive a more direct reminder of the brand inside their rooms , which each carry a @entity74 catalog			1
still , @entity79 admits , " hotels are a very different and complicated business			0
" it helps , of course , to be partnered to a larger hotel chain			0
@entity108 is a joint venture between @entity74 and the luxury division of @entity111			1
@entity74 opened its first hotel in @entity113 in 2004 and now also has branches in @entity115 , @entity116 and , as of last summer , @entity27			1

" a hotel is an entity that goes beyond the confines of fashion			0
it 's something that will endure over time			0
" like its competitors , @entity72 touts that hotels give them a better base from which to truly sell a lifestyle			2
" in our hotels we offer something that in its own way equates perfectly with the spirit of @entity72 's clothes , " says @entity128			2
" it is an approach to life : comfort , functionality , and aesthetics , all in perfect harmony			0
" the hotel even goes so far as to assign each guest their very own " lifestyle manager , " a position that is best described as an @entity72 - clad personal concierge			1
