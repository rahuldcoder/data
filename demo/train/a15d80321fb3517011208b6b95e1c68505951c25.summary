@entity0 -- @entity0 has started an unpopular tradition : wreaking havoc with the holidays			0
and it 's possible it could happen again this year			2
with less than a month before the @entity11 , doctors who treat @entity10 patients do n't yet know how much the government will reimburse them , parents are n't sure if their local @entity15 will turn away students , civilians in the military do n't know how many days they could be furloughed , and families ca n't yet estimate the price of milk			1
all because @entity20 has n't finished its work on must - pass legislation			1
unfortunately , it 's becoming an annual occurrence			0
a year ago , @entity20 spent the holidays battling over the " fiscal cliff			1
" lawmakers worked early into @entity27 to prevent the combustible mix of tax increases and budget cuts , which experts warned would have damaged the economy			1
the previous year , @entity20 worked on christmas eve to craft a short - term deal to avoid an increase in the payroll tax , a decrease in unemployment benefits , and a cut to doctor payments for @entity10 patients			1
and in 2010 , lawmakers and @entity41 broke a rancorous stalemate by reaching a breakthrough agreement a full 10 days before @entity44 to extend @entity46 's expiring tax cuts			2
in 2009 , the @entity47 was in session on christmas eve voting on the @entity50			0
@entity20 and the president are once again on course to shake up the holidays			1
milk and food the @entity56 , which sets the nation 's food policy and priorities , is two years overdue			2
@entity20 has been passing short - term extensions instead of the usual five - year plan , but key negotiators now say a short - term fix is not an option			1
if it fails to pass a @entity56 , the economic impact for ordinary @entity66 could be quite severe			2
the price of milk would more than double to an estimated $ 7 per gallon as government subsidies expire			1
the cost of food overall would go up , with supports for commodities such as corn and wheat also running out			0
@entity0 gridlock risks $ 7 milk another huge factor : food stamps			2
the @entity56 authorizes spending for that program			0
@entity82 @entity81 want to drop 3.8 million people from those rolls next year -- about 8 % of recipients - while @entity86 are n't keen on those cuts			1
but they would likely have to agree to some reductions for a deal to be reached			0
doctors and their patients for doctors , the holidays are a stressful time if they see @entity10 patients			1
that 's because their reimbursements are caught up in political wrangling and budget negotiations			1
it 's called the " doc fix " and they would see a 24 % reduction in their reimbursements if @entity20 fails to act			1
while there is bipartisan support for doctors to receive payments in full , there is plenty of disagreement between the two parties on how to pay for the costly program			2
the latest estimate from the nonpartisan @entity114 found the " doc fix " would cost $ 138 billion over the next decade			0
while that 's far lower than the $ 316 billion the @entity114 projected the previous year , it 's still hard to find an extra $ 138 billion lying around			2
the @entity82 announced a path forward but the @entity47 has not			0
it 's unclear how this issue will be resolved			0
if @entity20 fails to fully reimburse them , doctors have threatened to stop seeing @entity10 patients			1
that 's not a viable option as more and more baby boomers sign up for @entity10 every day			1
defense and diplomas a group of bipartisan , bicameral negotiators are working on a deal to fund the government for 2014			1
they have until december 13 , the self - imposed deadline			0
the group formed as part of an agreement to reopen the government after a 16 - day shutdown in october			0
congressional budget talks at critical point while the two committee leaders say they are making progress , rep. @entity140 , @entity141 , one of the @entity142 on the conference committee , threw cold water on any imminent budget deal , telling @entity1 the talks " are going way too slowly			1
" one key issue is the next round of annual , across - the - board spending cuts -- also known as the sequester			2
those reductions this time would total $ 110 billion and run for the entire fiscal year			1
the 2013 reductions took effect in march and ran through september , and agencies would be more limited in manipulating their budgets to account for spending reductions , according to a report by the liberal - leaning @entity162			0
sequester cuts have had a wide - ranging impact on adult job training programs , schools for low - income students , civilian defense contractors and military readiness , the report says			2
but that was for 2013			0
the role of the sequester on schoolchildren , service members and job seekers is still unclear as @entity20 has yet to agree on what the budget would look like			1
the 2014 fiscal year began two months ago			1
patients and patience for millions of @entity66 who buy health insurance in the individual marketplace and for the uninsured , the option of receiving health care is supposed to be available this holiday season			2
while the @entity41 administration has said the federal website , @entity190 , for people to sign up for coverage is working much better , it 's clear that problems still exist			0
officials warn glitches will persist and describe the online site as an ever - evolving work in progress			0
after website woes , @entity82 to push benefits of @entity50 if people ca n't complete their application on @entity190 by december 23 -- two days before @entity44 -- then they wo n't receive coverage on january 1 , causing anxiety during an already stressful time of year			0
@entity20 and the president in recent years , the holiday spirit has been lacking in @entity0 as acrimonious debates have taken over the season			1
a recent move by @entity86 to get rid of the filibuster for many presidential nominees -- the nuclear option -- could add to the season of partisanship on @entity216			0
and displeasure with @entity41 's deal on @entity220 's nuclear program has added an additional layer of mistrust between the branches of government			0
the @entity225 might have some competition this year			0
@entity1 's @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , and @entity232 's @entity231 contributed to this report			0

@entity20 has made a habit of working until the last minute to meet fiscal deadlines
this year , congressional negotiators are working on a budget for 2014
if @entity20 fails to act , the price of milk could spike
doctors face cuts to reimbursements for seeing @entity10 patients
