to @entity2 , @entity1 sen. @entity0 is the fighter for @entity3 who " refused to let @entity4 turn its back " on the state in the aftermath of @entity8 almost 10 years ago			1

if you know anything about @entity0 , you know that is an ingrained characteristic , she does n't shy away from a fight			0
" @entity0 is in a different kind of fight this year -- a fight to keep her @entity16 seat against a stout challenge from @entity41 rep. @entity41			1
every national poll since the start of september has shown @entity41 besting the incumbent			0
@entity9 did her part on saturday to knock @entity41 but never actually referred to him by name			1
" from what i have heard , @entity0 's opponent did n't really lift a finger after @entity51 , " @entity9 said , using a familiar @entity0 campaign attack that cites a 2012 no - vote against legislation that included disaster relief money for the state after @entity51 rocked the state			1

" i have now worked with three presidents , four majority leaders and six governors , " @entity0 said within the first few minutes of her speech			1
" and i know how to get work done for you , no matter what the line up in @entity4 is and no matter how gridlocked it might be			0
" @entity0 , however , finds herself behind in her fourth race			0
@entity41 has sought to tie @entity0 to president @entity82 , who in much of @entity3 is markedly unpopular			2
in nearly every ad , @entity41 mention that " @entity0 supports @entity82 97 percent of the time			0
" the attacks have worked and some polls show the @entity88 senator might be past the point of @entity9 's saving			1
@entity0 advisers and spokesmen on saturday told reporters to disregard most of the polling and instead pointed to early voting totals as proof that momentum is swinging their way			2
in particular , @entity99 , a senior adviser to @entity0 , pointed to the fact that 33 % of early ballots totals have come from black voters , a strong demographic for the @entity104			0
