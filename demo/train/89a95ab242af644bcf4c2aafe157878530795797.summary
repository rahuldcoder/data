@entity0 -- the suspected @entity0 gunman walked up to a security checkpoint , shot a @entity6 officer " at point - blank range , " went up an escalator , then came back down to shoot his victim again , a federal prosecutor said saturday			1
that @entity6 officer , @entity10 , died of his wounds			1
the man who shot him , authorities say , is 23 - year - old @entity15			1
a federal complaint was filed saturday afternoon charging @entity15 with two felony offenses -- murder of a federal officer and commission of violence in an international airport , said @entity24 attorney @entity23			1
if convicted , @entity15 would face life in prison without parole or the death penalty , according to the federal prosecutor			2
the @entity24 attorney general would decide if a death sentence would be sought			0
according to @entity23 , the suspect walked up to a @entity6 checkpoint in @entity34 around 9:20 a.m. , pulled a " @entity37 .223 - caliber @entity36 assault rifle out of his bag and filed multiple rounds " at the uniformed officer			1
he walked away , went up an escalator , then came back down to fire more shots at @entity10 , @entity23 said			2
the gunman then proceeded through the terminal -- hitting two other uniformed @entity6 officers and a civilian passenger with gunfire , said @entity23 -- before he was shot and wounded himself by airport police			1
by then , people were sprinting for their lives -- down escalators , out emergency exit doors , cramming into bathrooms and first - class lounges , anything to get out of the line of fire			2
two people suffered what @entity59 special agent in charge @entity60 called " evasion injuries , " getting hurt as they were trying to avoid being shot			1
@entity15 is being treated in a hospital after being shot himself by airport police , @entity60 said late saturday afternoon			2
" he is unresponsive , " the @entity59 official added , " and we are unable to interview him , as of today			1
" ' conscious decision to kill ... @entity6 employees ' so how did he ended up handcuffed to a gurney , leaving behind five magazines of ammunition that @entity0 mayor @entity76 said " could have literally killed everyone in that terminal " ? source : angry , rambling texts some clues have emerged -- including that authorities found he 'd been carrying a rant that appeared to refer to the @entity85 plus anti-government claims , a federal law enforcement official said saturday			1
it 's not clear what gave rise to the references , and federal investigators have found no known links to known groups or anything in the suspect 's background to explain them			2
@entity97 is generally considered to be a conspiracy theory in which people suspect a group of elites is conspiring to form an authoritarian , one - world government			1
@entity60 , from the @entity59 , said the handwritten note indicated the suspect made " a conscious decision to kill multiple @entity6 employees			1
" " he addressed them ( @entity6 officers ) at one point in the letter , " @entity60 said , " and stated that he wanted to ' instill fear into their traitorous minds			1
' " in his diatribe , the gunman claimed the @entity6 treats @entity24 like terrorists even though all people are n't equally dangerous , a @entity24 law enforcement official said			1
and near the end of the note was a derogatory reference to @entity124 , the former head of the @entity125 that includes @entity6 , according to the same official			1
another clue to the state of mind of @entity129 -- who was dropped off at the airport by a roommate who , investigators believe , did n't know about any shooting plot , the law enforcement official said -- came from his family			1
he lives in @entity0 , but his family back in @entity137 were concerned about him , said @entity138 , chief of police in @entity139 , @entity137			2
@entity15 's family became concerned in recent days after he sent his brother and father " angry , rambling " texts venting about the government , living in @entity0 and his unhappiness generally , an intelligence source said			0
opinion : arming @entity6 officers not the answer but despite the unsettling text , @entity15 's family was still surprised by friday 's events			1
" they 're upset , " @entity138 told reporters			0
" i mean this is a shock to them , it 's a shock to our community			0
" widow of victim : ' i am truly devastated ' @entity15 is being treated for his injuries at @entity163 , according to an intelligence source			0
so , too , is one other person -- the hospital said saturday one person is in critical condition and the other is in fair , without specifying their names , and noted another person was treated and released friday			0
two other patients were transported to @entity173 in @entity174 , said @entity175 , a trauma surgeon there			0
@entity175 described one as a " middle - aged " person with minor injuries from being shot in the shoulder			2
the other had no signs of life when he arrived at the hospital , the surgeon said friday			0
it 's presumed that fatality is @entity10 , the lone person killed in the shooting according to authorities			0
he 's the first @entity6 officer to die in the line of duty since the agency was founded in 2001			1
the late officer was working as a travel document checker at the time , @entity6 workers ' union and federal sources say			1
@entity199 said airport police quickly applied first aid to @entity10 , put him in a wheelchair , then rolled him to an ambulance			0
" they were absolutely committed to trying to save a life , " the police chief said			0
" unfortunately , that did n't work out			2
" @entity10 would have turned 40 next week			0
his widow described him as a " wonderful husband , father , brother , son and friend			0
" " i am truly devastated , " his widow said			0
the chaos also affected more than 165,000 passengers on hundreds of flights , as the airport shut down for hours			0
by early saturday afternoon , all of it -- including @entity34 -- was reopened			2
by then , security was out in force -- an " enhanced deployment " that included @entity0 police department officers and air marshals in addition to airport police , according to airport police chief @entity199			2
some were uniformed , others were undercover			0
" for today and for the foreseeable future , we 'll continue ( to have ) a very high profile at the curbs and anywhere in those ticketing areas and anywhere on our campuses , " the chief said			0
@entity6 : number of guns discovered in airports rising questions about recent repositioning of airport police the shooting has stirred questions about a recent repositioning of airport police officers around what is known as @entity0			1
@entity199 explained saturday that , in the past year , he decided to move officers from behind a @entity6 security checkpoint to in front of it , where they also took on " greater responsibilities " such as monitoring both the arrival and departure floors of the terminal			1
" the threat ... at the airport does not exist behind security at that podium , the threat exists from the curbline on , " @entity199 said			0
" so ... we have our people stationed throughout the airport			2
" that particular individual " -- he added , referring to the nearest police officer to the site of friday 's initial shooting -- " was just moved to the front part of the airport			2
" at the same time , @entity199 acknowledged the trade - off of having the officers roam a larger area , rather than sit at a checkpoint			2
" so are they going to be in the exact same ( place ) , exactly where i 'd hoped they would be ? no , " he said			0
" it did n't happen in this particular case			0
" was there anything more behind the shift ? a law enforcement source told @entity1 on saturday that airport police officers had complained to their union about being " bored with the assignment " of being stationed behind the @entity6 checkpoint			1
concurrently , @entity6 management complained that airport police officers were n't paying attention -- sometimes perusing their phones , using @entity292 or reading books on the job -- according to the same source			1
then came " a fix " agreed to by @entity6 and airport police management , to keep officers in the public areas but position them in front of the checkpoints , including the one where friday 's shooting began			1
part of the deal was that officers would never be more than two minutes from the checkpoint screening area , if needed , according to the law enforcement source			0
while @entity199 has n't addressed the claims of " bored " and " distracted " officers , he said saturday the @entity59 has indicated his officers " were 60 seconds behind the suspect			1
" however it was decided where they 'd be standing , he insisted the two were where they were supposed to be , and did what they were supposed to do			0
" our officers were deployed where they were supposed to be and performed heroically in this particular matter , " @entity199 said			0
@entity6 administrator @entity323 called the shooting " a significant event " that will prompt a review of security protocol with partner agencies			1
speaking saturday from @entity0 , @entity323 said , " this gives us great concern , so we 'll look at what our policies are			0
" @entity1 's @entity333 in @entity0 and @entity1 's @entity334 in @entity335 reported and wrote			0
@entity1 's @entity336 , @entity337 , @entity338 , @entity339 , @entity340 , @entity341 , @entity342 , @entity343 , @entity344 and @entity345 contributed to this report .			0
