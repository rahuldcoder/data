@entity0 -- the @entity2 defended president @entity3 from criticism that he was tone deaf in his reaction to the mass shootings at @entity8			1
@entity3 : shooting a ' cowardly ' act for a second straight day , @entity2 press secretary @entity10 faced questions about a monday afternoon event that occurred as the situation at the @entity8 was still unfolding			1
@entity3 touched on the tragedy before forcefully criticizing conservative republicans who are threatening to shut down the government			1
@entity3 pressures conservative republicans @entity19 to @entity2 republicans : do n't shut down government " i understand that some @entity15 are trying to make something of this , " @entity10 said on tuesday in response to a question from @entity1 senior white house correspondent @entity24			1
" the president spoke about the @entity8 at the very top of his briefing			2
he talked about the cowardly act that had taken place , the tragedy that was unfolding and the loss of life and he called for and demanded a seamless investigation with federal and local law enforcement officials and that is what we 're seeing now , " @entity10 said			2
@entity3 himself stepped in on tuesday to address the controversy , telling @entity42 in an interview to " keep in mind " that he addressed the shooting while it was still going on , " while we were still gathering information			1
" he continued , " i think that everybody understands that the minute something like this happens , i 'm in touch with the @entity54 , i 'm in touch with my national security team , we 're making sure that all the assets are out there for us to deal with this as well as we can			0
" on the other hand , @entity3 said , " what is also important to remember is that @entity59 has a lot of work to do right now " in a short period of time , noting looming fiscal deadlines that he says are crucial for the economy			1
@entity3 had planned on tuesday to tout his economic accomplishments on the fifth anniversary of the @entity69 meltdown and criticize a group of conservative @entity15 for their push to shut down the federal government if the national health care law is n't defunded			1
his comments were designed as a prelude to the @entity2 battle plan in the fights over the upcoming deadlines over government funding , the debt ceiling , and as a @entity81 begin to start enrolling in the @entity82 , better known as @entity82			2
5 things @entity3 planned before shooting a distracted president struggles with the economy @entity2 officials did delay the event from late morning to early afternoon , to ensure that the president would n't be speaking at the same time at a news conference updating the evolving situation at the @entity8			1
but they said they never considered canceling the event			0
" we are confronting another mass shooting and it happened on a military installation in our nation 's capital			0
it 's a shooting that targeted our military and civilian personnel , " the president said at the top of his remarks			0
" these are men and women who were going to work , doing their jobs protecting all of us			0
they 're patriots and they know the dangers of serving abroad but today they face the unimaginable violence that they would n't have expected here at home			0
" but minutes later @entity3 took the fight to some in the @entity15 , saying , " i can not remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it ca n't get 100 % of what it wants			1
that 's never happened before but that 's what 's happening right now , " and adding that forcing a shutdown would be the " height of irresponsibility			0
" your guide to a government shutdown debt ceiling ' x date ' could hit oct. 18 the president 's quick pivot first to the latest developments in the @entity131 crisis and then into his criticism of the @entity15 stands in contrast to his initial reaction to last december 's shooting of 20 children and six adults in @entity138 , @entity139 , when he urged national unity			1
and it brought criticism from @entity2 speaker @entity143			2
" it 's a shame that the president could not manage to rise above partisanship today , " the top @entity15 in @entity59 said in a statement a few hours after @entity3 's event			1
@entity150 chairman @entity149 continued the attack on tuesday , tweeting " disappointing that @entity152 could n't rise above partisanship yesterday ... hours after # @entity154 " former house speaker and 2012 @entity15 presidential candidate @entity156 expanded on the criticism			1
" president @entity161 , in the tragedy of the ( space shuttle ) challenger , postponed the @entity162 because he realized the country needed to be in mourning			0
president @entity3 should have recognized that an event this painful and tragic , in the nation 's capital , required being president rather than partisan , and being concerned about people rather than concerned about attacking , " said @entity166 , a co-host of @entity1 's " @entity167			1
" a top @entity15 strategist went a step farther			2
" when there is a tragic event like this in the nation 's capital and the local baseball team expresses that it would be insensitive to participate in the national pastime , but the president proceeds with a self - congratulatory press conference to celebrate his miniscule economic accomplishments , it tells you the @entity3 administration has become tone - deaf , " said @entity175 , a @entity1 contributor who co-founded @entity178 , a bipartisan public affairs firm			2
" @entity191 , who ' felt our pain , ' would never have made this mistake			0
" opinion : gun control is not the answer it 's not just republicans who are critical of the president -- a senior @entity202 consultant was critical of @entity3 's timing , too			2
" suprisingly tone - deaf			0
national unity has been at the heart of the @entity3 brand since his 2004 ' there are no red states and no blue states ' speech			0
to pass up a chance to unite the country after a tragedy was a missed opportunity			0
unhelpful in terms of politics			0
even more unhelpful in terms of governance , " said the consultant , who asked to remain anonymous to speak more freely			0
while @entity10 says the president " was horrified by this news " ( of the shootings ) , he defended monday 's @entity2 event and would n't entertain any second day quarterbacking , saying " we knew what the public knew , " adding " we had the same information you did			1
" will rampage move the dial on gun control ? and he pushed back against criticism that @entity3 's speech was partisan			0
" far from being a partisan speech , the president made clear in his speech that many @entity15 on @entity238 agree with him that we should not go down the road of threatening to shut down the government or defaulting on our obligations in the name of some partisan agenda item , " @entity10 said			0
and @entity2 officials questioned the appropriateness of some @entity247 who they say were launching partisan attacks at the administration on monday over last september 's deadly attack at the @entity81 consulate in @entity253 that left the @entity81 ambassador to @entity255 and three other @entity81 dead			1
later monday , the tone did appear to shift at the @entity2			0
a latin music event in the @entity258 that was planned for the evening was postponed , according to @entity2 officials , " in light of today 's tragic events at the @entity8 and out of respect for the victims and their families			1
" around the same time , the @entity81 flag on top of the @entity2 was lowered to half staff			2
