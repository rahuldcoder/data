-- girls in the @entity3 are entering puberty at earlier ages than they have in the past , a new study reports			1
more than 10 percent of white 7 - year - old girls in the study , which was conducted in the mid- 2000s , had reached a stage of breast development marking the start of puberty , compared to just 5 percent in a similar study conducted in the early 1990s			1
black and @entity14 girls continue to mature faster than white girls , on average			0
nearly one - quarter of black girls and 15 percent of @entity14 girls had entered puberty by age 7 , according to the new study , which appears in the journal @entity23			1
but the trend toward earlier puberty is not as pronounced among blacks as it is among whites , the researchers say			1
although the rate of early puberty among black girls in the study ( 23 percent ) was higher than that observed in the early 1990s ( 15 percent ) , the increase was not statistically significant			1
@entity0 : is it baby fat or obesity ? " white girls are catching up , " says dr. @entity38 , @entity39 , the lead author of the study and the director of adolescent medicine at @entity43			0
experts are n't sure what 's behind the increase in earlier puberty , but it 's likely due to a combination of factors , including the childhood obesity epidemic and substances in the environment			1
early puberty in girls is a growing public health concern because studies have shown that girls who start puberty earlier are more likely to develop breast and uterine cancer later in life			1
the @entity63 funded the study as part of a larger investigation into the environmental factors that contribute to breast cancer risk			0
video : girls becoming women sooner " breast cancer is such a common problem , so if we can find some of the things that make it more likely , we could improve screening of those early developers , " says dr. @entity72 , @entity39 , an assistant professor of pediatrics at the @entity74 , in @entity75			0
( @entity83 was not involved in the new research			0
) cancer risk is n't the only concern surrounding early puberty			2
early development in girls has been linked with poor self - esteem , eating disorders , and depression , as well as cigarette and alcohol use and earlier sexual activity			2
" if an 11 - or 12 - year - old girl looks like she 's 16 , people will interact with her as if she were 16 , " @entity38 says			2
" early maturation increases the rate of risk - taking behaviors and lowers academic performance			2
it does n't mean it 's going to happen , but it could			2
" @entity0 : plastic baby bottles and @entity104 : health risk or hysteria ? between 2004 and 2006 , @entity38 and his co-authors assessed the breast development of more than 1,200 girls ages 6 to 8 in three major @entity3 cities ( @entity111 , @entity112 , and @entity113 )			1
the stage of development in which a girl 's breasts begin to " bud " is considered the onset of puberty , not her first menstrual cycle			2
the average age of the first period has declined as well , says @entity83			0
" girls used to get their first menstrual period at 14 or 15 , " she says , but now the average is closer to 12			0
@entity0 : the big three hormones regardless of their race , girls with a higher body mass index ( @entity132 ) -- a ratio of height to weight -- tend to mature sooner , the researchers found			0
this finding , which has been reported in other studies , suggests that soaring obesity rates among children may be contributing to the rates of early puberty			0
but it 's not yet clear why girls -- and especially white girls -- are starting to physically mature at younger ages			0
one theory is that excess body fat affects the levels of hormones that trigger puberty			0
@entity0 : 4 things that mess with your hormones chemicals in the environment -- most notably bisphenol - a ( @entity104 ) , which is found in many hard plastic products -- may affect hormones as well , says dr. @entity161 , @entity39 , a professor of pediatric endocrinology at the @entity164 's @entity163			1
a girl 's experience in infancy and even in the womb may also contribute to earlier puberty , according to a second study that appears in the same issue of @entity23			1
@entity0 : make play areas greener and safer for kids in that study , which included about 4,000 girls in the @entity178 , researchers from the @entity175 found that mothers who had their first period before age 12 , smoked during pregnancy , and were pregnant for the first time had daughters who entered puberty sooner than other girls			0
above - average weight gain during infancy was also associated with earlier puberty , the study found			1

experts are n't sure what 's behind the increase in earlier puberty
studies showed girls who started puberty earlier at greater risk for certain cancers
