-- ever wondered if a @entity1 is more trustworthy than a @entity2 ? or if a @entity3 is more likely to help you out than a @entity5 ? or which @entity7 nation is the most arrogant ? as @entity7 gears up for the @entity9 -- an annual event that often seems to be less about the music than national stereotypes , kitsch and dubious voting patterns -- a survey has come out this week that could add fuel to the fire			1
for its study of attitudes in the @entity20 , the @entity17 surveyed people in eight @entity7 nations : @entity23 , the @entity24 , @entity3 , @entity2 , @entity1 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27			1
while much of the survey is focused on the effects of the economic crisis , those questioned also give an intriguing insight into the stereotypes they hold about their neighbors at a time of austerity			2
asked which @entity20 nation is most likely to be named most trustworthy , those in seven out of eight countries picked @entity2			2
the only ones who disagree are the @entity1 , who pick their homeland as the most trustworthy -- and label @entity2 the least trustworthy , the most arrogant and the least compassionate			1
" the prominent role @entity2 have played in @entity7 's response to the euro crisis has evoked decidedly mixed emotions from their fellow @entity7 , " the report says			1
" in the wake of the strict austerity measures imposed in @entity1 , @entity1 enmity toward the @entity2 knows little bound			1
" @entity2 also suffers when it comes to perceptions of compassion , with six of the eight nations surveyed considering it the least compassionate			1
the two nations that differ on that point , @entity3 and @entity2 , pick @entity23 as the least compassionate -- perhaps a reflection of historic enmities or tensions over the @entity7 project			1
@entity23 in turn consider the @entity3 the least trustworthy and the @entity2 the least compassionate			1
meanwhile , the @entity1 themselves do not fare that well			2
they are considered the least trustworthy by the @entity3 , the @entity2 and the @entity24 , the report points out			1
in a likely reflection of frustrations over corruption and political horsetrading , @entity25 consider their own country most likely to be named least trustworthy			0
the question of arrogance splits the @entity3			2
they consider themselves both the most and the least arrogant nation			0
the @entity23 and @entity2 agree that @entity3 should be named the most arrogant , but everyone else gives their vote to @entity2			1
the @entity7 surveyed tend to hold a more charitable view of their own national character			2
six out of eight countries pick themselves as the least arrogant , and every nation considers itself the most compassionate			0
centrifugal forces other questions in the @entity86 report , titled " @entity87 : the @entity20 , " reveal deep divisions and anger over the path the @entity20 is following			0
in @entity27 , @entity25 and @entity1 , which have suffered greatly as a result of austerity measures following the global economic downturn , public opinion is particularly bleak			2
nearly 80 % of @entity27 and 72 % of @entity1 surveyed say economic conditions are very bad , while a majority of @entity25 say the same			1
this compares with a median of 28 % for the rest of @entity7 , the report says			2
unemployment is a " very " big concern for more than nine in 10 people in each of those three countries			0
meanwhile , 80 % of the @entity3 say unemployment is a very big problem , but less than a third of the @entity2 agree			1
such concerns have impacted people 's attitudes toward the wider @entity20 , the survey finds			0
" the prolonged economic crisis has created centrifugal forces that are pulling @entity7 public opinion apart , separating the @entity3 from the @entity2 and the @entity2 from everyone else , " the report 's authors say			1
" the southern nations of @entity27 , @entity25 and @entity1 are becoming ever more estranged as evidenced by their frustration with @entity120 , @entity121 and the perceived unfairness of the economic system			1
" the survey highlights a growing despondency among the @entity3			0
whereas before @entity3 has bridged the gap between @entity7 's north and south in terms of culture , politics and economics , times have changed , the researchers say			1
" the darkening mood in @entity3 makes @entity3 public opinion look less like that in @entity2 and more like attitudes in southern @entity7 : @entity27 , @entity25 and @entity1 , " it says			1
perhaps a win in the @entity9 final on saturday could cheer the @entity3 up -- or at least give something to justify that stereotype of " arrogance			2
" then again , perhaps not			0
victory is seen by some as a curse rather than a blessing when times are hard , because whoever wins this year faces the expense of being next year 's @entity9 host			0
the contest , taking place this year in the city of @entity156 since @entity157 won in 2012 , will bring together 39 countries and is expected to attract more than 100 million tv viewers across @entity7 , organizers say			0
eurovision is widely loved for its combination of over-the - top costumes , kitsch pop songs , sometimes questionable talent and international rivalries			0
after all the finalists have performed , the voting begins			0
countries award a set of points from one to eight , then 10 and finally 12 for their favorite songs			0
they ca n't vote for themselves and they must announce the score in both @entity176 and @entity3			0
television viewers can cast votes in their respective countries through telephone hotlines , which count toward the final vote			0
many perceive the voting to be tactical , with neighbors or members of regional blocs , such as the former @entity188 nations , appearing to base their scoring on geopolitical alliances rather than artistic merit			0
@entity0 's @entity192 contributed to this report .			0
