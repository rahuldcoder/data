@entity0 -- a 9 - year - old boy 's request to have @entity4 listed as the place of birth on his @entity8 passport was supported by the @entity8 @entity9 on monday			1
@entity10 was born in @entity11 , a disputed region in the eyes of the @entity14 administration , which claimed the larger issue should be resolved by bilateral negotiations , not by a 2002 federal law favoring the family and 50,000 other @entity8 born in the holy city			1
the @entity20 urged the courts to stay out of the matter			1
but the justices by an 8 - 1 vote said the courts could intervene and decide the matter			1
that jurisdictional barrier is now overcome and the family can continue to pursue their legal claims			2
the case is a classic fight between congressional and executive authority , with foreign policy the source of the current controversy			0
at issue before the high court were two questions , one narrow , one broad : can courts intervene to enforce a federal law explicitly directing the @entity42 how to record the birthplace of an @entity8 citizen on a passport ? and does the law impermissibly infringe on the president 's power to recognize a foreign sovereign ? " there have been 50,000 americans in the last 10 years that were born in @entity11 , and many of them would like to have @entity4 indicated as their place of birth in the passports , " @entity52 , a @entity54 professor , and until recently a counselor on international law at the @entity42 , said in november			1
" but this is also an extremely important geopolitical issue and a very sensitive foreign relations issue for the @entity8			1
" the high court case was @entity10 v. @entity65 , but the key player in this dispute is perhaps the most famous city in the world , and one of the oldest human settlements still in existence : @entity11			1
its name translates as " @entity75 " to some , " @entity76 " to others			0
it is @entity4 's largest city and its capital , though that is not recognized by the @entity82 and most of the world community			1
the city is home to @entity86 and @entity87			0
the couple and their two oldest children were born in the @entity8 , but the family migrated to @entity11 a decade ago , and in 2002 the youngest , @entity92 , was born			1
" we 're very proud of the fact that he was born in @entity4 and that we live in @entity4 and it 's the modern state of @entity4 , " @entity93 told @entity1 correspondent @entity94 last year			1
" religiously and historically , that 's very significant			2
" just three weeks before @entity10 was born , the @entity99 gave @entity8 citizens born in @entity11 the individual discretion to ask that @entity4 be listed on passports and consular reports , where it says " @entity104			1
" president @entity105 signed the bill , but issued an executive " signing statement " indicating he would not comply			0
the law , he said " impermissibly interferes with the president 's constitutional authority to conduct the nation 's foreign affairs and to supervise the unitary executive branch			2
" that law , and the @entity10 's long - standing request , were at the center of the 70 - minute arguments before the justices in november			1
" they 're both proud @entity8 citizens but feel a very strong affinity , religiously too , to the state of @entity4 , " said @entity119 , the @entity10 's @entity0 - based lawyer , last year			1
" their son is very proud of the fact that he is the one sibling born in @entity4			1
" it is not the first time the @entity99 and @entity129 have clashed over the region			0
the @entity8 embassy remains in @entity132 , over @entity8 lawmakers ' objections			2
the boy 's mother made the " @entity4 " request about two months after his birth , but embassy officials refused			1
his passport in fact shows his round , innocent face , and " @entity11 " is listed as his place of birth			2
" that 's been the @entity42 's practice , the general rule for @entity8 citizens born abroad is that their passport lists only a country of birth , " said @entity119 in november			1
" so if a citizen is born for instance in @entity155 , it says @entity156			0
if they 're born in @entity132 or @entity159 , it says just @entity4			1
if you 're born in @entity11 , instead of saying the country , the city is listed -- just a city -- @entity11			0
" the attorneys for the @entity165 have framed their case as a modest request , one that does not implicate the president 's foreign policy power			0
they are asking the high court not to decide a political question , but simply tell the administration to enforce the law , for the sake of a little boy			0
" it is a very personal case			0
what 's at stake is their deep personal pride and sense of identification with the state of @entity4 , and their right , given by @entity99 , to express that , on the passport , " said attorney @entity187 , who argued the family 's case before the high court in november			1
" that pride , and the national pride of others , is clearly what makes that region as much front page news as it often is			0
but i do n't think that this case itself is asking for any kind of broader determination than allowing these individuals that opportunity			0
@entity99 has recognized that it 's part of his self respect , that he should be able to say @entity4 , and that 's all that we 're asking for in this case			1
" the government is thinking of the bigger picture			0
@entity42 officials would not comment on the record on a pending case , but president @entity14 has acknowledged the stalled peace process has created divisions both in that region and in the @entity8			2
" palestinians should know the territorial outlines of their state ; @entity4 should know that their basic security concerns will be met , " he said in a may 2010 speech			2
" i know that these steps alone will not resolve this conflict			0
two wrenching and emotional issues remain : the future of @entity11 , and the fate of @entity219 refugees			0
but moving forward now on the basis of territory and security provides a foundation to resolve those two issues in a way that is just and fair , and that respects the rights and aspirations of @entity4 and @entity219			2
" choosing a home , and being able to decide what to call it may seem like a fundamental right			0
but nothing is so easy when @entity11 is mentioned			0
the @entity165 say they recognize the geo - political complexity , but think in this case , in this judicial forum , the solution is simple			0
" everybody knows @entity11 is in @entity4			2
why is the @entity42 refusing to recognize this ? " said @entity187			0
" they have this fear of nonexistent hobgoblins , which has caused them to follow this policy , and it 's about time -- @entity99 thought it was about time -- they get rid of that policy ... all that we 're asking the @entity9 to do is agree with @entity99 , that this is a foolish policy , and ought to be eliminated			0
