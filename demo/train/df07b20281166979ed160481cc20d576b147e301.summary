-- @entity2 majority owner @entity1 just figured out how to get rid of a product that no one wants to purchase by throwing himself on the confessional table of bigotry -- which will probably make him more wealthy than he could have ever imagined			1
sure , the publicity is n't flattering , and @entity1 's hand may have been forced by the @entity2 ' internal investigation			1
but this is not about racism , this is about business			0
what we know i 've lived in @entity2 for close to 20 years -- the @entity2 games are boring ! i ca n't name the players			1
i do n't know who they are married to or what they do in the community			2
they are not a fabric of my interest			2
i wish they had a star player whose jersey i wanted to buy so i could finally hang my @entity31 jersey up as memorabilia			0
this is not about racism , this is about business			0
so , like all other @entity39 natives living in @entity2 long term , when the @entity2 play the @entity41 , this @entity37 whips out her @entity43 jersey and heads to @entity46			1
the reason @entity1 could not make the @entity2 profitable is not because black people do n't buy season tickets , or arrive at games late , or spend all their time at the bar , or black fathers do n't bring black sons to the games			1
it 's because the @entity2 suck			1
they have no marquee players and they do n't win games ! ( yes , they 've made the playoffs in the past seven years , but have n't gotten as far as the conference finals			2
) this is not about racism , this is about business			0
the few years that the @entity2 have made it to the playoffs , you can hardly make it down @entity68 in time for tip - off because the traffic is so thick			1
fans , white and black , show up when their hometown team is winning			1
this is not about racism , this is about business			0
opinion : @entity2 owner is a hypocrite are there unique factors to every city that accounts for distinctions between fan bases ? sure			2
@entity86 , @entity87 , @entity41 and @entity88 fans show up -- even when their teams are not having a winning season			0
those cities are not as transient as @entity2			2
that 's something @entity1 fails to realize is unique to @entity2			1
this is not about racism , this is about business			0
@entity1 's 2012 email , in which he shared his ideas about why his franchise was not as profitable as he hoped , as unscientific as it was , can hardly be called shocking or rise to the level of racially polarizing			1
it was another wealthy white man sharing his commonly thought views on the spending habits or lack thereof of black consumers and how that affects white consumers , who white business executives consider the most valued consumer in @entity112			0
this is not about racism , this is about business			0
i was slightly annoyed with @entity119 commissioner @entity118 commending mr. @entity1 for coming forward and self - reporting			2
@entity1 revealed his email of august 2012 to @entity118 in july 2014 , after the @entity2 found it in an internal investigation and precisely the time that investigators for @entity123 were looking to expose other @entity119 owners for any possible racial missteps			1
it 's no coincidence that an @entity119 investigation on this @entity1 matter was kept secret and remained pending until the @entity130 deal became final			1
why are we just now hearing about it ? @entity118 knew , yet he did n't reveal it to the public			0
racism has never been as profitable in the @entity119 as it is right now in the wake of the historic $ 2 billion sale of the @entity138 , the almost doubling of national television deals that are sure to bring record profits to the league , and the identification of interested purchasers lined up and ready to close the deals			0
@entity1 is a businessman following the business model : strike while the iron is hot			2
this is not about racism , this is about business			0
join us on @entity153 / @entity152 .			0

@entity2 *co-owner* to sell his interest in team after racially charged email
@entity160 : the email was n't shocking and team 's *problems* have nothing to do with race
she says the failure to put a winning team on the court is the real problem
ivory : @entity1 could reap a financial *reward* in this sale
