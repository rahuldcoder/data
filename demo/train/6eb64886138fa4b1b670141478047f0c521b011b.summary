ready for @entity0 , a super pac founded by @entity3 devotees , has started to grease the wheels of state politics , currying favor with local @entity7 by exchanging important data about the group 's supporters with @entity12 and @entity13 campaigns ahead of the 2014 midterms			1
the list exchanges are a clear attempt by the super pac to build goodwill and to win over state parties ahead of a possible @entity21 presidential run in 2016			1
to date , the @entity17 has exchanged records with campaigns in 14 different states : six @entity12 campaigns , four @entity13 races , four gubernatorial campaigns and three @entity7 committees and organizations , according to a person familiar with the list swaps			1
in return , @entity32 is receiving data from each campaign and growing their list of possible volunteers and donors ahead of 2016			1
representatives from the group declined to name specific campaigns with which they have swapped names , citing confidentially agreements with each campaign			1
@entity32 has built the list a number of ways			0
supporters become part of the group 's voter file when they give a donation or attend an event put on by the group			1
the pac has held over 500 events across the country -- the majority of which were in early presidential primary and caucus states			2
all of those names , emails and phone numbers , along with some other details , go into the @entity32 voter file			2
although seemingly simple , there is power in the names			2
some political data experts argue a good data file is worth more than donations			0
a former state party data director , who asked for anonymity to speak candidly , said getting names from a national organization is an " enormously helpful			1
" " @entity79 parties almost never have the money to do this on their own , " the official said			0
" @entity79 parties need national folks to do it			0
" @entity84 asked a number of state parties and @entity12 campaigns to confirm whether they swapped names with @entity21			1
the swaps are more than just currying favor , too			0
they are also an attempt by @entity32 -- a group that has been criticized by some @entity7 for focusing too much on 2016 's presidential election -- to quell those concerns and help @entity7 in 2014			1
more valuable than money @entity7 face a difficult map in the 2014 midterms			0
winning back control of the @entity13 has all but become a pipe dream and the party is focused on maintaining control of the @entity12 -- an endeavor that may prove difficult			1
in turn , campaigns and state parties are looking for as much help as they can get			1
one such way is to provide campaigns with a list of politically engaged voters and volunteers in their area			1
@entity114 , a senior fellow at the @entity115 and expert on campaign finance , said " these names are increasingly as valuable as a contribution			1
" " campaigns are starting to realize that good names are more important than just having more dollars to spend on television , " said @entity114 , who also is a professor of government at @entity121			1
" these names become people who can do the important things that campaigns ca n't necessarily buy			1
" lists are an important , yet complex , aspect of campaigns			2
once cultivated by an organization , they can be traded , sold or rented to different groups			0
each list is worth a certain amount of money , too , which is given by third - party companies that house each data set			2
@entity114 said the practice is becoming more common as power of online campaigning grows			0
in ready for @entity0 's case , lists are traded " on a one - for - one basis " for " equal value , " according to a person familiar with the list swaps			2
good data lists do more than just activate voters and raise money			2
the most up - to - date voter lists connect supporters to their social media accounts and can be used to engage people through their friends and family			2
one senior @entity7 source who has worked with data at the highest levels said this amount of detail can be critical for a campaign 's messaging			1
" i would argue that in this era of declining trust in politicians and political ads , the validation that comes from your friends is critical , " the source said			0
@entity7 have held a data advantage over @entity176 for the better part of the last 10 years and president @entity178 showed in 2008 and 2012 how critical understanding voters and the data around them can be to winning the @entity13			1
in order to win the @entity13 in 2016 -- should she run -- @entity21 will have to tap back into the @entity7 advantage			1
swaps help @entity32 ... and @entity0 list development and swapping is a practice that dates all the way back to the @entity190 era and has traditionally been done by campaign committees or leadership pacs			0
but @entity3 's possible 2016 candidacy is unique			0
@entity21 was out of domestic politics for four years while she served as secretary of state and does not have a leadership pac within her direct control , as is the case for other possible 2016 candidates			1
enter @entity32 , a group of outside supporters , former aides and excited young staffers who have spent the last year holding events across the country for a candidate who has yet to even announce her intentions			0
when it was founded in 2013 , the group had two primary goals : urge the former secretary of state to run for president and collect a massive amount of voter data to help that endeavor			2
but with time and backing from prominent former @entity21 aides , @entity32 has grown in popularity and its goals have evolved			2
the group , though , has faced some skepticism since its founding			0
early on , some questioned @entity32 for @entity0 's goals and its ties to @entity21			1
more recently , some @entity7 have worried that the group was causing key voters to overlook 2014 in favor of 2016			0
@entity229 , ready for @entity0 's spokesman , disagrees with the latter criticism			0
" from the moment our organization was created , we have sought ways to channel the massive enthusiasm around a potential @entity0 campaign into helping @entity7 efforts this year , " @entity229 told @entity84			2
but words only go so far and the pac is trying to counter questions with actions			0
ready for @entity0 has kept eight regional staff throughout the country , including two staffers in @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 and @entity248			0
these staffers connect with local parties and attend party conventions and meetings , regularly with checks in hand to donate from the pac			2
since may , @entity32 has donated thousands of dollars to 29 different state parties , according to a source with the group			1
most of these donations were upwards of $ 10,000 , the max the group can give to a state party			0
but do n't expect @entity32 to stay focused too long on the midterms			0
just days after voters go to the polls this november , ready for @entity0 will hold a strategy session in @entity267 for its top donors			0
the event is being billed as the " premier opportunity " for supporters to " come together and meet one another while we wait to hear what @entity0 will decide			0
" and the list that @entity32 has been swapping is also a key piece to the group 's 2016 strategy			0
multiple people close to ready for @entity0 acknowledge quietly that the super pac will likely sell , rent or swap with a hypothetical @entity21 campaign			1
the name swaps also help if @entity21 decides to run			2
the former first lady is the prohibitive to be the @entity7 ' presidential nominee in 2016			0
she has the highest name recognition and is ahead in every poll			0
what she will need to do over the next year if runs : win over the state politicos and parties			1
while it is sometimes hard to believe that a few names , phone numbers and emails can curry favor among state parties , according to multiple big data experts , the names can sway state parties and local political operatives			1
that is what @entity32 is banking on .			0

@entity305 super pac is exchanging data and the names of its supporters with @entity12 , @entity13 campaigns
exchanges an attempt to build goodwill with state parties that will be important if @entity21 runs
data about voters is important because it can build a campaign 's fund - raising , volunteer efforts
