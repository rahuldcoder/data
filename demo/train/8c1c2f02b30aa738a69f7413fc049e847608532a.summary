-- it was the picture of @entity2 that made the father of slain @entity5 student @entity4 do a double - take			1
it was uncanny how much the suspect in the disappearance of @entity11 student @entity10 resembled the police sketch of the man wanted in connection with the kidnapping and sexual assault of a woman in @entity18 , @entity19 , in 2005			2
police also linked that suspect to @entity4 's case			1
could it be the same man ? could it be the man behind the 2009 killing of their 20 - year - old daughter , @entity4 ? " i told @entity33 this person might have been involved in @entity4 's murder , " @entity30 told @entity31 tuesday on @entity0 's " @entity32			1
" @entity4 's comments came a day after @entity37 said there was a " new forensic link " between the @entity41 and @entity4 cases			2
on tuesday , a law enforcement official speaking on condition of anonymity told @entity0 that dna evidence links @entity2 to the death of @entity4			1
almost from the beginning , after news of @entity41 's disappearance , @entity4 's parents were struck by the similarities between the two cases			2
authorities check unsolved cases for ties to @entity10 case " both @entity10 's going missing and @entity4 's abduction happened about the same time of year , " @entity57 said			1
it also happened about the same time of night , and with some of the same circumstances , she said			0
the family of @entity4 searches for answers @entity4 went missing after attending a @entity64 concert in @entity65 in october 2009			1
her remains , including splintered bones , were found on a farm on the outskirts of the city in late january 2010			2
the last major development in the @entity4 case came in 2010 , when her slaying was connected to the kidnapping and sexual assault of another woman in @entity18 in 2005			1
that woman was able to provide police with enough of a description to make a sketch			0
police at the time did not identify the woman who provided the description and said only that " forensic evidence " linked the two cases			0
it 's that sketch and its similarity to @entity2 that is the closest thing the @entity4 family says they have to an answer as to who possibly was responsible for killing their daughter			1
" you do n't get over it , " @entity57 said			0
" but i do believe you get past it , " and you can work to help others , she said			0
the priority right now , she said , is finding @entity41			0
@entity41 was last seen september 13 in an area of @entity65 known as the @entity104			0
police have asked owners of large parcels of property in surrounding counties to search their land and report back			0
@entity10 disappearance suspect questioned in 2002 alleged rape case investigators believe @entity2 was the last person with @entity41			1
he has been charged with abduction with the intent to defile in the case , and he is being held in jail in isolation , according to @entity65 police			0
police investigators have not publicly connected the dots except to say that the arrest of @entity2 has given them a break in @entity4 's case			1
@entity30 has a message for the man he believes killed his daughter : " i would like to say how could you take another person 's life ? how could you possibly be so awful to abduct someone and kill them ? ... it 's beyond understanding			2
