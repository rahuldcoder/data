-- @entity1 is smiling , like a lot of people do when he explains that badminton is his full - time job			1
perhaps that mirth would evaporate if those people regularly had to face down a shuttlecock hurtling towards them at a speed of 185 miles per hour			1
or if they came face - to - face with his most treasured possession -- an @entity13 silver medal , won with doubles partner @entity14 at the 2012 games in @entity16			1
" badminton is very popular in @entity20 but it 's seen as a hobby sport , " @entity1 told @entity0 's human to @entity18			1
" after the @entity13 we are quite famous here and ( people ) still often ask us , ' do you do this for a living ? ' " even though it 's popular , and everyone has played it once in their lifetime , they still see it as a hobby			2
" a closer inspection of the sport at the highest level should wipe away any lingering smirks			0
it can occasionally be hard to keep track of the relentless back and forth such is the breakneck speed at which the world 's best operate			2
@entity1 has been attuned to this intense wave of frequency since the age of eight , when badminton drew him in			1
" badminton is definitely faster than tennis , " @entity1 explained			1
" you have strokes over 300 kph ( 185 mph ) so it 's an extremely fast sport -- only tennis table is faster			1
you need to have your reflexes ready when you play because it goes very , very fast			0
" the skills that are most important are speed -- even though the court looks small on television it is quite big -- and you need to be quick around the court , and you have to have a very good technique			1
" as you can see we do n't have the biggest arms but we really have a big smash , a lot of us			0
i 'd say power and stamina are two very important things			0
" as is , of course , his relationship with his badminton buddy			2
@entity1 and @entity14 were first paired together in 2004 by a coach at the national training center and started a steady climb towards the world number one ranking , which they clinched in 2011			1
the duo have won a tranche of titles , including the prestigious @entity87 crown in 2011 -- one @entity14 describes as the equivalent of winning @entity89 -- but none bigger than their @entity13 silver			1
their success is a testament to their on - court chemistry , and their battle to maintain that level of hunger as they head towards the twilight of their careers			1
" one of our things is that we 're strong mentally , " @entity1 explains			1
" there are a lot of things going on between you and your opponent			0
" it 's important to look your opponent in the eyes when it gets close in the games and also to believe in yourself that you can be good enough to win tournaments			0
" there are a lot of very challenging parts of the game ; for me and @entity14 it 's when we do n't have our best day , we need to struggle with ourselves			1
" that 's extremely difficult because we can be our own biggest opponent ourselves if one of us does n't feel comfortable , or motivated			0
so for us now in our senior years we struggle with that , particularly after some of our bigger achievements			0
" it created a bit of emptiness afterward and made some of the tournaments a little bit unimportant			0
that 's what we 're fighting with			0
" that motivation still burns bright enough to win titles though , as demonstrated by their recent victory at the @entity144 held at the @entity145			2
they are still formidable opponents for anyone on the 13 - event global @entity148 run by the sport 's governing body , the @entity150			2
but given they dovetail so neatly on court , it is perhaps a surprise to hear their off - court characters are almost complete opposites			1
" me and @entity1 , we are very different from each other , so i think that 's a good mix to play at a high level , " @entity14 explains			1
" we have to talk a lot , find out what we are doing , what we need to practice , talk about feelings			0
" i 'm very relaxed			0
@entity1 , he wants everything in boxes , to know today , tomorrow , how we travel , and i 'm very relaxed so if we do n't practice that today , we 'll do it tomorrow			2
" despite these differences , the pair are united by the feelings provoked within them prior to a big match -- a crackling tension that helps both @entity1 and @entity14 hit top gear on court			1
" the feeling you have just before a match , i think you can compare it with going into an exam , you are a little bit tense , and a bit nervous , " @entity1 explained			2
" but that 's also important , it 's the feeling you have when you 're about to do something that really matters to you			0
" you are a little nervous , and you 're struggling a little bit breathing , and not that comfortable , but that 's important , because it means it matters what you 're about to do			0
" then , when the winning point is sealed , @entity14 explains what a weight of pressure is lifted off their shoulders			2
" it 's a huge feeling , when you win the last rally you go crazy , you think of all the tough hours during practice , these small moments are so crazy , you go crazy and celebrate and being very happy , " he said			0
" it 's very difficult to describe , you need to go it on your own to understand how big it is for us to win a tournament or reach an @entity13 final			0

@entity1 and @entity14 are a @entity20 badminton doubles pair
they won silver at the @entity213 and have a string of titles to their name
@entity1 still gets asked if he does badminton as a full - time job by people in @entity20
speed is vital to get around the court and return shots which can reach 185 mph
