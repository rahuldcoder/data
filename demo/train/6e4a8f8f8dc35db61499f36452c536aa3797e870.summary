-- dueling theories of how the universe was created got a split decision friday night from the @entity4 , which required examination of " all sides of scientific evidence " in new science standards , but rejected language requiring teachers to teach the " strengths and weaknesses " of scientific theories			1

the debate pitted proponents of @entity23 's theory of evolution against supporters of religion - based theories of intelligent design , or creationism			1
@entity32 loses , and the kids lose because of this , " board chairman @entity30 , a creationist , told the @entity31			2
a final 13 - 2 vote approved language that will be printed in textbooks beginning in 2011 and remain there for 10 years , @entity0 affiliate @entity35 in @entity36 reported : " in all fields of science , analyze , evaluate , and critique scientific explanations by using empirical evidence , logical reasoning , and experimental observation and testing , including examining all sides of scientific evidence of those explanations so as to encourage critical thinking by the students			1
" earlier , the board rejected two sections written by @entity30 on identical 8 - 7 votes , the @entity31 said			1
one section required teachers to " analyze , review , and critique scientific explanations , including hypotheses and theories , as to their strengths and weaknesses using scientific evidence and information , " and the other required high school students to study the " sufficiency or insufficiency " of key principles of evolution			1
opponents were pleased with the board 's action on @entity30 's sections , but unsatisfied with the final result			2
" the phrase has been an open door to religious indoctrination in public schools , " @entity78 , a lawyer with the @entity79 , told @entity35 , referring to the " strengths and weaknesses " phrase in the material voted down			1
" this document still has plenty of potential footholds for creationist attacks on evolution to make their way into @entity32 classrooms , " @entity88 , president of the @entity89 , told the @entity31			0
she predicted battles over textbooks in the coming years , a prediction @entity30 bolstered			0
publishers , he said , will " have to get their textbooks approved by us in a few years			0
" the size of the textbook market in @entity32 gives it influence nationwide , as publishers adapt their material to its standards			0
@entity23 's theory of evolution proposes that humans evolved over millions of years from animal species -- including , most famously , early primates that also are the ancestors of modern - day apes			0
such thinking , which challenged religious accounts of a deity creating humans , was considered radical , even blasphemous , when @entity23 published it in 1859			0
@entity121 to @entity23 's thesis was his scientific explanation of life 's diversity : that natural selection is enough to explain the evolution of all species			1
the scientific community has overwhelmingly scorned creationism and its latest incarnation , intelligent design , as a pretext for biblical explanations of how the world came to be , and asserts that there is no weakness or doubt in the scientific community about evolution			1
last year , the @entity140 called for the public to be better informed about the importance of understanding and teaching evolution			0
the academy released a booklet titled " @entity147 " -- the third explanation of evolution put out since 1984 by one of the nation 's leading scientific organizations			1
however , those who take issue with evolution believe it should be treated with healthy skepticism and argue that having high school students question a scientific theory overwhelmingly accepted by scientists teaches them critical thinking			1
" this debate will impact whether students are taught to think critically and scientifically when you learn about evolution			0
it 's important for students to learn how to think like scientists and not be forced to treat these controversial topics like a dogma , " @entity166 , a policy analyst with the @entity167 , a group that questions the theory of evolution , said in an article in the @entity171			0
proponents of evolution say the dogma is on the other side , with the @entity167 and others purposely distorting and ignoring scientific evidence to reach their desired conclusion			1
for decades , the teaching of evolution in public schools has been a flash point in some states , with proponents of ideas such as creationism and intelligent design trying to gain a place in science classes			2
the issue has been before school officials , legislators and courts in @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 and @entity205			0
the controversy over the teaching of intelligent design came to a head in @entity209 , where the @entity210 voted that ninth - grade students must be read a statement encouraging them to read about intelligent design			0
a federal judge said the board violated the @entity215 in doing so because intelligent design is religious creationism in disguise and injecting it into the curriculum violates the constitutional separation of church and state			2
" academic freedom " bills have emerged but failed in various state legislatures , the @entity219 said			0
an " academic freedom " act has been adopted as law in @entity204 , and there is legislation in @entity202 calling for an " academic freedom " bill that would mandate a " thorough presentation and critical analysis of the scientific theory of evolution			2
" the center says such bills are strategies by creationists to appeal to the @entity239 sense of balance , and give the false sense that there are different sides to scientific issues such as evolution			1
" two plus 2 is not 5 , " said the group 's spokesman , @entity246 .			0
