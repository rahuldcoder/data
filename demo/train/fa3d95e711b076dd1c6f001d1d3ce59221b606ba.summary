with seemingly every kid in @entity2 glued most waking hours to a glowing digital device , you might expect their parents to be worried about the potentially harmful effects of all that screen time			1
turns out , not so much			0
the majority of parents in the @entity2 are largely unconcerned about their young children 's media use , according to a @entity13 study released tuesday			1
this despite 70 % of parents saying that smartphones and tablets -- so - called " digital babysitters " used to appease bored or fussy kids -- do n't make parenting any easier			2
based on a nationally representative survey of more than 2,300 parents of children up to 8 years old , the study " reveals a generational shift in parental attitudes about technology 's role in young children 's lives , " said @entity20 , director of @entity13 's @entity21 and lead author of the report			1
an overwhelming majority ( 78 % ) of parents say their children 's media use is not a source of family conflict , while 59 % say they are not worried about their children becoming addicted to phones , tablet computers or gaming devices			1
the study found that 55 % of parents are " not too " or " not at all " concerned about their children 's media use , compared to 30 % who are concerned			1
the study , " parenting in the @entity49 , " also challenges two key assumptions about media and parenting : first , that smartphones and tablets have become today 's " go - to " parenting tools			2
instead , parents say they are more likely to turn to toys or activities ( 88 % ) , books ( 79 % ) , or tv ( 78 % ) when trying to keep their children occupied			2
of those with smartphones or tablets , 37 % say they are very or somewhat likely to turn to those devices			0
even when trying to calm an upset child , parents say they are still more likely to turn to a toy or activity ( 65 % ) or to a book ( 58 % ) than to a media device			0
second , the survey challenged the notion that the dominant pattern in most households is children pleading for screen time while parents try to limit it			0
" today 's parents ( of young children ) grew up with technology as a central part of their lives , so they think about it differently than earlier generations of parents , " said @entity13 's @entity20 in a press release			1
" instead of a battle with kids on one side and parents on the other , the use of media and technology has become a family affair			0
" the impact of heavy media and technology use on kids ' social , emotional and cognitive development is only beginning to be studied , although some early research suggests the @entity96 may actually be changing how our brains work			0
among the other findings of the report : -- with the exception of video games , parents think more positively than negatively about the impact of media ( tv , computers and mobile devices ) on children 's reading and math skills and their creativity			1
-- parents ' most consistent concern about digital media is their negative impact on children 's physical activity			1
-- parents view video games more negatively than tv , computers or mobile devices			0
parents rated video games as more likely to have a negative effect on children 's academic skills , attention span , creativity , social skills , behavior and sleep than any other medium			2
-- parents view computers as less harmful to their kids than tv or mobile devices			0
the study was presented tuesday at a conference on " parenting in the @entity49 : how @entity143 and @entity144 , " at the @entity145 in @entity146 .			0
