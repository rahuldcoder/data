secretary general @entity11 told reporters at the conclusion of a two - day summit of the alliance leaders that the plan calls for handing over security responsibilities to @entity4 forces in 2013 , then withdrawing foreign forces the following year			1

time : @entity3 's @entity4 problem : the @entity4 " we have finalized plans so 2014 will be a year in which the @entity9 will not be spending as much money in @entity4 as it is spending today			1
it will save money and we will be providing security ourselves , " he said			0
" that transition and the eventual withdrawal in 2014 of the @entity9 forces and other @entity1 forces from @entity4 is good for @entity4 and good for our allied countries			1
" @entity3 said @entity1 leaders were leaving @entity40 with " a clear road map " to bring the war in @entity4 to a " responsible end			1
" " i do n't think that there 's ever going to be an optimal point where we say -- this is all done , this is perfect , this is just the way we wanted it and now we can wrap up all our equipment and go home			0
this is a process , and it 's sometimes a messy process , just as it was in @entity54 , " he said			0
the second day of their two - day summit focused on @entity4 , with @entity24 and the heads of other countries contributing to the @entity9 - led @entity59 also in attendance			1

" @entity11 confirmed that some @entity1 members have agreed to contribute money for the $ 4 billion a year needed to help fund the @entity4 security forces after the @entity1 mission ends , but said the summit was never intended to secure that funding			1
while the @entity4 force is expected to number 350,000 in 2014 , @entity11 said the size would likely decrease in future years depending on the security situation on the ground and other factors			2
he also said he expected an agreement soon for @entity86 to reopen its border with @entity4 to military shipments of departing @entity1 forces , which would resolve a sticky issue in planning the withdrawal of foreign forces			1
" so far , the closure of the transit routes has not had a major impact on our operations , " @entity11 said , but added the transit routes were very important and that he expected their reopening " in the very near future			0

when asked about turning over security responsibility to @entity4 forces next year , @entity11 denied it was an acceleration of the transition , saying the plan all along was to withdraw troops in 2014 after shifting the lead security role to @entity4 forces			1
" it has been within our road map right from the outset , " he said			2
asked monday by @entity25 whether @entity4 will be ready by 2014 to assume full responsibility for the country 's security , @entity24 responded : " absolutely			1
" " we 've already worked out a plan to have in six months time 75 % of the country taken over , with regard to security by the @entity4 security forces , " he said			2
outside the @entity1 meeting , protesters marched and rallied on monday , a day after violent clashes with police			0
