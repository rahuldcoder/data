-- @entity1 has admitted he is unlikely to play again this year as he set his sights on a return from injury at january 's @entity5			1
the former world no. 1 has been sidelined with tendonitis -- inflammation in the knee -- since withdrawing from july 's @entity11 tournament and has not played since losing to unseeded @entity13 @entity12 in @entity15 's second round			0
eleven - time grand slam winner @entity1 refused to rule out playing in @entity19 's @entity18 final match against @entity13 in november , but admits it could be difficult to force himself into the team after a three - month absence			1
" my biggest goal is to compete at @entity5 , " the 26 - year - old @entity23 told @entity24 , referring to the first grand slam of 2013			1
" about the @entity18 final , of course i would love to take part in it , but first i have to see if i will be ready technically and physically			2
" we would have to ask whether i am the right choice to compete in a @entity19 team that has been long preparing for this important tie considering also the months i have spent without playing			0
but that 's a decision that it 's not mine			0
" @entity1 has won the @entity18 on three previous occasions , in 2004 , 2009 and 2011 , but missed out on @entity19 's 2008 triumph with a previous knee complaint			2
" let 's take it one day at a time , " added the former world no. 1			0
" i 'd rather be cautious especially after trying to recover for the @entity43 and for the @entity44 with no success			0
" i prefer to go day - by - day without setting objectives or time frames , work hard on my recovery and make sure i keep on getting better little by little			0
" @entity1 has been forced to watch from the sidelines as longtime rival @entity50 returned to the top of the world rankings after winning a seventh @entity15 singles title			2
he has also seen @entity54 's @entity53 , who won the men 's singles gold medal at the @entity43 , move above him in the world rankings after securing his first grand slam title at last month 's @entity44			1
currently ranked fourth in the world , @entity1 has qualified to play at november 's season - ending @entity60 in @entity61 , but his ability to take part is in doubt due to his injury problems , admitting that his knee is still " bothering him " .			1
