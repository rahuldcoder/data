-- " these are the explosive devices , they are all made locally , " captain @entity0 explains , crouching down and pointing to the metal cylinders , perhaps just 20cm in diameter -- dozens of them are lined up next to each other			1
the cylinders are packed with a deadly concoction of fertilizer , explosives and other chemicals bought from the local market			1
" i do n't want to name them so that the government does n't confiscate them from the shops , " @entity0 says			2
placed on the top of the cylinder thick nuts and bolts -- which will turn into lethal shards of shrapnel once detonated : crude , but highly effective			1
" this one would blow up a jeep or a pick - up , " he says , pointing to two of the cylinders which a rebel is roughly taping together , in the final stages of preparation			2
" for a tank or an armored vehicle we use six or eight			2
" outgunned by @entity39 's forces , the captain 's team -- the @entity37 -- is resorting to @entity41 - style guerilla warfare , turning to roadside bombs and , in at least one case , a suicide bombing			1
escalating violence limits @entity48 observer mission in @entity49 , official says clips said to be of the brigade 's operations are often posted to @entity53 , starting off with a quranic verse , followed by stylized graphics of the brigade 's name , and its division -- the @entity59			1
hardly audible below the music -- a jihadi chorus meant to motivate -- a voice narrates each attack			0
the videos are all very similar in tone to those that came out of @entity41 when @entity69 - allied insurgents there took on the @entity72 military			1
in that battlefield the @entity73 proved to be the most effective weapons against @entity72 armor			0
in @entity49 today it is also becoming the weapon of choice			1
@entity0 says they have received no outside help			0
" our funding is dependent on donations , a small collection of money			0
and what we 're able to capture from the @entity49 military			1
we have not received any help even from the @entity91 leadership or the @entity92 , " he claims			0
and so , he says , they have had to improvise			0
is @entity49 in a civil war ? " we only have @entity95 , sniper rifles , machine guns , " @entity0 explains			1
" and the regime is fighting us with tanks and rockets			0
we do n't have heavy weapons			0
we 're relying on mines and on making bombs			1
" @entity0 says he commands 300 men			0
the @entity105 is made up of around 8,000 , operating mostly in @entity107 province			1
there is no way of confirming such claims			0
the division , he says , was first made up of defectors and civilians and has gradually increased in numbers			1
he says his men are moderate islamists , who follow the military council of the @entity91 , fighting for democracy			2
" as military men , we do n't want to see one in power , " he says			2
" we want a democratically elected president , we have to separate the military from the presidency			2
" we are also fighting corruption and those opportunists that are in the @entity107 countryside , " he continues , referring to people he says are capitalizing on the uprising to wreak havoc and carry out operations in the name of the opposition			0
the men look relaxed as they calmly mill around among the olive groves , @entity95 slung over their shoulders			0
this is territory they control			0
they are a ragtag collection of rebel fighters but in this part of @entity107 province in @entity49 , they boast of taking the fight to the @entity49 regime			1
just back from a mission , one of the fighters explains that it failed			2
" we set up an ambush against @entity39 's army using ieds but they received intelligence about our plan and rerouted the convoy			2
" another claims his unit was successful			0
" we destroyed an armored vehicle , " he boasts			0
this is now the @entity49 battlefield			1
fifteen months on , peaceful protests have morphed into more of an insurgency that threatens to become an all out war			0
@entity72 military completes initial planning for @entity49			1
