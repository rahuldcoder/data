editor 's note : below is an excerpt from @entity5 's autobiography , " my remarkable journey , " published by @entity6 and available at bookstores nationwide			1
@entity5 anchors " @entity9 at 9 p.m. et on @entity10			1
@entity5 recalls a much - needed win at the track during one of the lowest points of his life			1
i was thirty - seven years old			1
i had a couple hundred thousand dollars in debts			2
and a four - year - old daughter			1
i 'd take @entity20 to our secret park on our visiting days			2
that 's when the pain cut the deepest -- looking at my daughter and knowing i had no way to support her			1
things got bleaker and bleaker			2
by late may , i was down to forty - two dollars			1
my rent was paid only until the end of the month			2
i locked myself in my apartment wondering how bad things could possibly get			2
pretty soon i would n't even be able to afford cigarettes			2
i remembered a night when i was a young man in @entity35 , alone , cold , and without cigarettes or the money to buy them -- i had smashed open a vending machine to get a pack			2
a friend called up and told me to start living like a human being again			1
he invited me to the track			1
i had nothing better to do , and i figured it would be good therapy to get out and have lunch with a friend and watch the horses come down the stretch			1
i 'll never forget that day			1
i put on a @entity52 jeans outfit that had no pockets and drove to @entity54			2
i can still see the horses warming up before the third race			2
there was a horse called @entity59 -- a filly running against males			1
normally , female horses do n't beat males			1
we 're talking cheap horses			2
i scanned the board and saw that she was 70 - 1			1
but my eyes really opened when i looked at the racing form			2
racetrack people talk to each other			0
so i turned to the guy next to me and said , " you know , this horse , three races back , won in more or less the same company			1
why is she 70 - 1 ? " " well , " the guy said , " there 's a couple of new horses here			1
" " yeah , but she should be , like , 20 - 1			1
i bet ten dollars on the horse to win			1
but i kept looking at the horse			1
the more i looked at this horse , the more i liked it			1
i bet @entity88 on top of every other horse and below every other horse			1
now i had what 's called a wheel			0
@entity5 's life in pictures Â» i kept looking at the horse			1
wait a minute , i told myself , i 've got four dollars left			0
i have a pack of cigarettes			0
i 've got ta give the valet two bucks			0
that still leaves me with money to bet a trifecta			1
my birthday is november 19			0
so i bet 11 to win , 1 to place , and 9 to show			1
now i had bets in for 11 on top , 11 on bottom , and 11 to win			0
and i had a trifecta -- 11 - 1 - 9			1
when the race began , i had two dollars left to my name -- and that was for the valet			0
they broke out of the gate			0
the 1 broke on top , the 9 ran second , and the 11 came out third			0
the 11 passed the 9 , passed the 1 , and they ran in a straight line all around the track			1
there was no question about it			0
the 11 won by five lengths			2
the 1 was three lengths ahead of the 9			0
i had every winning ticket			0
i had it to win			0
i collected nearly eight thousand dollars			0
eight thousand dollars ! it had to be one of the happiest moments of my life -- certainly the most exciting			0
but i had no pockets			0
so i stuffed all the money in my jacket			0
i did n't know what to do with it			0
i ran out of the track			2
the valet attendant came over and said , " you leaving so early ? " " yeah			0
" " bad day , mr. @entity5 ? " i tipped him fifty dollars			1
i had to go somewhere , to stop and make sure it was real			0
i drove to a vacant lot , which is now called @entity146			0
i parked among the weeds and opened up my jacket			0
all the money spilled out			0
i counted out about seventy - nine hundred dollars			2
i paid my child support for the next year			2
i paid my rent for a year			0
i bought twenty cartons of cigarettes and stacked them up in my apartment , and i filled the refrigerator			0
up to that point , that may have been the happiest moment of my life			0
now , today , if i go to the track and win $ 8,000 , it 's very nice , but it wo n't affect my life one iota			1
it 's nice to win			0
but when you really need it ...			0

at age *37* , @entity5 had $ *42* to his name , no job and a daughter to support
he became reclusive but *decided* it would be " good therapy " to go out with a friend
they went to the track , and @entity5 bet on a female horse whom the odds were against
@entity5 won a much - needed $ 8,000 that day
