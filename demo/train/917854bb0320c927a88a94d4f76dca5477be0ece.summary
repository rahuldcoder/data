-- who was the first person you called the day your ex dumped you ? or that time you found a weird bump ? or the day you stumbled across that pair of barely worn @entity7 at the @entity8 ? you need to break connections with " friends " who only bring negative things into your life			1
if you 're like me , you called a girlfriend			0
while i love my man , and adore my cats to what some might consider a scary degree , the relationships i have with my girls is on an entirely different plane			0
they 're the funniest , smartest , weirdest ( in a good way ! ) gaggle of broads i 've ever met and i feel lucky every day to have them around			1
it was n't always this way			0
i 've had to prune my posse ( please note that i 've also been kicked out of people 's lives as well ) and have discovered some types to avoid			1
drama queen the @entity34 is n't happy ( and " happy " is a relative term here ) unless she 's freaking out			1
little things us boring normals would shrug off -- like a missed bus or parking ticket -- become monumental shriekfests			0
she does n't get the flu , she gets oh - my - god - i - think - it 's - cancer ! everything is a crisis , and she demands constant handholding and attention			2
the @entity0 : 13 signs she 's a loser luckily , these types ca n't help but reveal their true colors pretty quickly and unless you 're content to be cast as an extra in your own life , you 'll banish her from the set			0
nurse @entity57 there is nothing that makes this one as happy as a friend in need			1
this may seem like a good quality ( and often is -- for a while ) , but once you 've got your butt back in gear , she either loses interest or , worse , reminds you constantly of how bad things once were , in the hopes that you 'll fall back into feeling like crap so she can " save " you again			1
the @entity0 : is it evil to talk a friend out of getting married ? you have two choices with this type -- either arrange it so you 're constantly in crisis , or pretend you 're problem - free so she gets bored			2
better yet , introduce her to the drama queen -- they 'll be very happy together			1
lady - hater " i do n't have female friends because all the women i meet are jealous of me			1
" yes , someone actually said this to me			0
instead , this person prefers her friends to be of the male variety -- ideally hopelessly in love with her and willing to do her bidding			2
the @entity0 : how do grown women make friends ? you do n't really have to worry about ditching this snot because she does n't want anything to do with you in the first place			2
the critic also known as the frenemy , the critic is chockfull of helpful suggestions			2
for instance , you know your favorite dress ? well , it makes you look kind of fat			0
speaking of which -- have you gained a little weight ? or are you pregnant ? are you sure ? well , never mind , you can have some of her old " fat " clothes since she has no use for them anymore			0
understandably , critics have a fairly high turnover rate in the friend department			0
i unfriended one such mean girl only to have her show up at a mutual friend 's birthday party -- for the sole purpose of telling the birthday girl exactly what was wrong with her ! ¡ @entity132 ! the leg humper do you know what it 's like to walk into a bar and find one of your closest friends making out with the guy you 've had a crush on for an entire year ? i do ! granted , that 's nowhere near as bad as my friend @entity142 who discovered her husband was schtupping her @entity144 , but still			1
and sure , nobody forced @entity142 's husband to be a cheating jerk , but a good girlfriend never would 've gone there with him			0
the @entity0 : why you should not pursue a taken man you 'll know when you 're in the presence of one of these bottom - feeders by the way you become invisible the second there 's a guy in the vicinity			0
so yeah , i had to learn the hard way			0
but having been put through the wringer by these types of lady - scoundrels makes me doubly appreciate the awesome dames i still have in my life			1
the @entity0 : when good friends go bad @entity168 all rights reserved			1

your friends are people you want with you in good times and bad
the critic and nurse @entity57 friends will like you when you feel bad
the drama queen and lady - hater will never let you have *center* stage
