@entity0 , @entity1 -- birdies are normally seen as a golfer 's best friend but at one course in @entity8 members are getting increasingly irritated by a certain feathered felon			1
for the last few months , a large raven has been stalking @entity11 in @entity12 before swooping and flying off with people 's balls			1
several players have witnessed the burglar at work while others have struck what they thought was an accurate shot only to arrive on the green to find no sign of their ball			1
@entity24 , the golf club 's office manager , says players are reporting stolen balls on a weekly basis			1
" it started to happen about four months ago , when you had the odd comment about a ball being taken by a bird , " @entity24 told @entity2			2
" because we are a seaside course , birds have picked balls up in the air so we took it to be something like that , but then it became consistent and persistent			2
" at first i took it as a bit of fun , as did most members , but it has got to the extent where it is having an effect on prizes and competitions and various other things			0
" one member , a former ladies ' captain , had two balls taken by the pesky bird in the same round , costing her a prize in the ladies ' match play competition			1
" the second time it happened she was walking to the ball with her partners , and the bird came down 15 meters away , looked at them , picked the ball up and flew away , " says @entity24			2
" it 's a very brazen bird , it does n't know any fear			2
it sees a ball , takes it and away it goes and we have absolutely no idea why it 's continuing to do it			2
" ravens have a wingspan of some 4 ft ( 1.2m ) and have a reputation for picking up shiny objects like pebbles and coins			0
some members think the bird is mistaking their balls for eggs			0
they claim to have beaten the thief by using yellow golf balls because the raven is only interested in snatching white ones			1
at least six ravens are housed at the @entity91 at the @entity93 's expense because of the traditional belief that if they are absent the tower will crumble and the @entity97 will fall			0
the birds are a protected species and officials at @entity101 have been warned off trying to catch their raven			0
" i think it 's here to stay , " says @entity24			0
" most people are just taking it as a bit of a hazard down here			0
you have bunkers and you have rough and now @entity101 have got the extra hazard of a bird			0
" ravens are not the only animals to have made enemies of golfers			0
last year in @entity117 , @entity118 - based tv station @entity116 carried a story of a man who had crafted a putting green in his garden only to wake up each morning to find a fox had stolen his golf balls			1
@entity125 eventually managed to catch the thief at work , but not before it had taken more than 100 of his balls			0
at the @entity131 at @entity132 in 1998 , a seagull swooped down and snatched @entity135 competitor @entity134 's ball off the green at the famous par - three island hole before dropping it into the water			1
on the @entity141 in december , players mingled with crocodiles at the @entity143 in @entity144 , @entity145 , for the @entity146			0
at the only golf course on the island of @entity150 there 's a local rule which states that there 's no penalty if a monkey steals your golf ball			1
and in @entity159 , golfers at the @entity158 are permitted a free drop if their ball lands in the footprints of a hippo .			1
