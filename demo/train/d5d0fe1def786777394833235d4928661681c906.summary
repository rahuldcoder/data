@entity0 -- remember the little box you can check off on your federal tax return to donate three dollars to pay for presidential campaigns ? @entity7 @entity6 voted that in this era of e-mailing or texting campaign contributions , it 's time to get rid of the federal program , and remove taxpayer money from presidential elections and political conventions			1
the @entity7 on thursday passed a bill that eliminates the " @entity19 " and uses the over $ 600 million it 's collected since the end of 2010 to pay for other programs			1
however , a similar bill in the @entity21 appears to be stalled			1
the @entity22 has said it opposes the measure , but has not yet threatened a veto			2
the @entity7 passed a similar bill in january , but this new legislation pushed by @entity6 also eliminates the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) , an independent agency created after the 2000 presidential recount in @entity29 to help states meet minimum federal standards for voting equipment and administering elections			1
rep. @entity34 , @entity35 , sponsored both bills , and argues that public financing in presidential races is no longer necessary			1
" everybody is about one viral video away from becoming world famous around here			2
it 's not hard to raise money			2
the @entity44 has totally revolutionized this			0
the @entity47 people have moved on , " @entity34 told @entity1			0
since the presidential election campaign fund was created in 1976 , the @entity48 reported that about 30 % of taxpayers participated in 1980 -- the highest rate on record -- but in 2010 less than 7 % of taxpayers checked off the box on their tax forms to direct money to the program			1
when the program was created , it originally directed $ 1 from the @entity60 to the fund for those who wanted to participate , but the amount was upped to $ 3 in 1994			1
taxpayers who participate do not increase their tax liability			1
candidates who apply for public financing must adhere to overall spending limits			0
those running for their party 's nomination can apply for partial federal matching funds by raising at least $ 5,000 in 20 states			1
according to the @entity75 , every campaign since 1976 has included at least partial public financing			0
but in the 2008 presidential campaign , both of the major political party candidates -- then - sen. @entity77 and sen. @entity80 -- opted out of the public financing system in the primary , and @entity77 decided against participating in it for the general election because he did n't want to be limited to the cap on campaign spending			2
@entity34 criticized @entity77 for trying to have it both ways -- he did n't want to operate within the public financing system himself , but has n't joined any efforts to eliminate it at a time when the money saved could be used for other priorities			0
but @entity95 say the fund and the @entity27 were put in place after two public controversies : public financing was created after the @entity100 and the @entity27 was set up after the 2000 @entity29 recount			0
they worry that eliminating them would erode public confidence about private money having too much influence in campaigns			0
rep. @entity108 , @entity109 , said the taxpayer funding is entirely voluntary , but that ending it now and closing down the @entity27 sends the wrong signal			0
" when we give the impression that our policy choices will be influenced by campaign donations , we sell out the @entity47 people			0
when we try to deprive citizens of information about their rights and responsibilities as voters , we erode trust in our system			0
it is tantamount to legal corruption and has no place in our democratic system , " @entity108 argued in testimony this week before the @entity126			0
the presidential election fund also helps pay for both parties political conventions			1
according to the @entity75 the @entity95 and @entity6 conventions planners have already received more than $ 18 million to plan their conventions in @entity135 , @entity136 , and @entity137 , @entity29 , scheduled for the end of this summer			1
@entity34 , who before serving in @entity139 was a top aide at the @entity140 , said both parties will spend more than $ 100 million on their conventions , but they do n't need to rely on federal help anymore because they can raise the money from private sources			1
" the president talks a lot about shared sacrifice			0
he should call up @entity148 [ chair of the @entity150 ] , my good friend and colleague , and say you should give back that $ 17 million and then the @entity6 i bet would feel they have to give it back , " @entity34 said			1
as for getting rid of the @entity27 , supporters of the bill argue that there once was a need for the agency to help states upgrade and meet standards after the 2000 election , but states stopped asking for federal guidance			2
but @entity95 whip @entity165 says doing away with the @entity27 only a year before a presidential election could lead to lower voter turnout			2
" the @entity27 's primary mission is to provide states with the resources they need to ensure everyone eligible to vote can cast their ballots and have their voices heard			0
we ought to be making it easier for voters , not eroding our ability to protect them and their right to participate , " @entity165 told @entity1 .			0

currently , taxpayers can direct $ 3 to support presidential elections and conventions
that option may *disappear* if a bill passes the @entity21
fewer than 7 % of taxpayers took *advantage* of it in 2010
the $ 600 million collected so far would be *redirected* to other programs
