@entity0 -- the @entity2 on tuesday approved the nomination of solicitor general @entity4 to become the nation 's fourth female @entity6 justice , setting up a final confirmation vote by the @entity2			1
the committee vote broke down mostly along partisan lines , with one @entity11 joining the panel 's @entity12 in sending the nomination to the full @entity2 on a 13 - 6 vote			1
democrats repeatedly characterized @entity4 as a strong legal thinker who would be a fair judge , while @entity11 slammed her as an inexperienced activist who would be unable to divorce her legal judgments from her political opinions			1
members on both sides expressed frustration with a confirmation hearing process many observers say increasingly yields few clear answers about a nominee 's judicial philosophy			0
" @entity4 is one of this country 's leading legal minds , and has shown throughout this process that , if confirmed , she would be a fair and impartial @entity6 who understands how decisions made by the @entity6 affect the lives of everyday @entity38 , " president @entity30 said after the vote			1
the " vote by the ( committee ) is a bipartisan affirmation of her strong performance during her confirmation hearings			0
" " there is no question about @entity4 's qualifications , " said sen. @entity44 , @entity45 - @entity46			1
" in my view , there is no good reason to deny her appointment			0
" she is clearly among nation 's " top legal minds			1
" " her grasp of each area of the law , and to reason within it , compared favorably with any of the nominees i have seen come before us , " @entity44 added			0
" candidly , it surpassed some			0
" @entity4 has demonstrated a " keen intellect , " " judicial modesty , " and respect for legal precedent , said sen. @entity69 , @entity70			2
" i 'm confident she will make a superb @entity6 justice			1
" not so , said sen. @entity73 , @entity74			0
@entity4 has " extremely limited experience " as a practicing attorney , he said			0
her record " has not been ( one ) of impartiality			0
" she has " far left ideological beliefs " and is likely to use an " outcome - based approach " to cases			0
sen. @entity82 , @entity83 , called @entity4 's june testimony " disingenuous " and " deceptive			2
" her " policy preferences will influence her legal judgments " if confirmed , he predicted			0
among other things , the committee 's @entity11 highlighted @entity4 's role in limiting military recruiters at @entity92 because of the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy , which bars openly gay and lesbian soldiers from military service			1
several @entity11 have said @entity4 , who was the law school dean , sought to treat the military as second - class by denying recruiters access to the campus @entity101			2
@entity4 has argued she provided an " equally effective substitute " by requiring military recruiters to use a veterans service office			0
sen. @entity105 , @entity74 - @entity106 , broke with other @entity11 committee members by voting for @entity4 's nomination			1
@entity105 -- also the lone committee @entity11 to back justice @entity111 's nomination last year -- said he had " 100 reasons " to oppose @entity4 's nomination on philosophical grounds			1
but , he argued , elections have consequences , and senators should be deferential to presidential nominating decisions			0
@entity4 , he argued , is sufficiently qualified , has a good character , and is capable of acting as a judge as opposed to a politician			2
noting the controversy over @entity4 's role in @entity92 's military recruiting controversy , @entity105 said he would oppose her nomination if he believed she has " animosity in her heart " for members of the armed services			1
but " i believe she is ... very patriotic , " he said			0
@entity105 said he is hopeful that @entity12 will follow his lead the next time a @entity11 president makes a high court nomination			1
if a liberal such as @entity4 can be confirmed , he said , " i hope @entity137 ( @entity136 ) @entity135 can be a conservatives ' hero " and be confirmed as well			2
many legal and political analysts said the hearings went as expected , with clear ideological divisions , and very little of substance revealed about @entity4 's views of specific issues			1
" it 's a real advantage for @entity4 that she 's never been a judge with controversial opinions , so she was nominated just because of her lack of an explicit paper trail , " said @entity147 , a lawyer and political science professor at @entity149			2
" and that 's what the current politics of @entity0 demanded			0
i think @entity30 wanted a relatively easy confirmation and it looks like he 's going to get it			2
" the committee 's chairman , sen. @entity160 , @entity162 , noted @entity4 did not advise the @entity30 administration on legal and constitutional issues surrounding a massive overhaul of healthcare			1
her supplemental written responses monday to questions from @entity11 senators seemed to indicate she would not recuse herself as justice if the legislation were appealed to the high court			1
in reference to a pending lawsuit over the legislation by several state attorneys general , @entity4 wrote , " i attended at least one meeting where the existence of the litigation was briefly mentioned , but none where any substantive discussion of the litigation occurred			0
" @entity4 added she was neither asked nor offered any opinion about the legislation or any appeals , and did not review any internal administration documents			0
her new answers also offer a possible reason -- she purposely scaled back her job duties as solicitor general in april , after the @entity190 quietly told her she was being seriously considered for the high court			2
@entity4 was eventually nominated may 10			0
the full @entity2 vote is expected to vote on @entity4 's nomination before departing for its august recess			1
if approved , @entity4 will fill the seat of retiring justice @entity196 and become the 112th person to join the high court			1
@entity1 's @entity199 and @entity200 contributed to this story			0
