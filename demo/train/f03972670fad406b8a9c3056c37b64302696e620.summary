from the beginning of 2015 , @entity0 is embarking upon an experiment with driverless cars			1
transport minister @entity4 has already labeled it " transformational			1
" in @entity8 's perfect world it 'll be the precursor to millions of driverless cars on our roads			1
for many , it has all the constituents of a recipe for disaster			0
and for the realists it 's unlikely to happen in a major way for at least a couple of decades			0
according to @entity8 , driverless cars will help out harassed mums by taking on the school run			1
they 'll give disabled people who currently ca n't drive the power of self - mobility			2
and best of all , they 'll scythe into that irritating statistic that says 90 % of road crashes are caused by human error			1
for many people , driverless cars are an alien concept			1
car maker @entity33 says 2012 data showed only half of 18 - 37 year - olds were ready for the driverless car revolution			1
that means half of this digitally - savvy age group were n't			2
@entity8 cites the technology as being the barrier for humans getting to grips with driverless cars			1
in 2014 , more than two million new cars will be sold in the @entity0			1
a significant proportion will feature the cruise control , self - parking systems , autonomous emergency braking and lane departure warning that enable a car to be driverless			1
we 're more than used to the technology			2
we understand computers are more than capable of reacting correctly to situations they 've been programmed to deal with			0
but we also know our roads are an incredibly complex , constantly evolving and entirely unpredictable environment			0
despite all our laws and rules , roads are random , like humans			1
consequently we are brilliant at reading the situations we find ourselves in ; accidents happen because we just do n't react correctly			0
the result of this is that having driverless cars sharing the road with human - driven vehicles has chaos written all over it			1
and we 're not just talking mayhem at street level			0
multiple car makers agree that the technology is already fit for purpose			2
it 's the legislation and logistics that need sorting out			0
to operate safely , self - driving cars need to talk to each other			1
they need to identify cars that are parked and therefore not a threat			2
if they 're traveling in a convoy at motorway speed -- " platooning " as it 's called -- car a needs to tell @entity89 to the side and behind that it wants to come off at the next junction			0
then @entity92 needs to tell car @entity93 behind that it 's slowing down to let @entity88 in and so on			0
the only way this can work is if they talk the same language			0
some car makers are currently working on this but industry insiders say the specifics are unlikely to be agreed much before 2030			0
they have n't even agreed how much control the computers should take			0
should they drive all the time ? or would humans retain some control ? once they have agreed that , drivers will need training			2
if you 're buying a car that 's going to hold your life in its computerized hands , the majority of responsible adults will want more than the 10 - minute handover chat from a salesperson already preoccupied with how to spend their month - end bonus			1
and if the car then crashed because its human had n't operated it properly , who would be liable ? does the owner 's insurance cough up ? is it the manufacturer who sold you the car but did n't brief you properly ? or the third party who supplied the manufacturer with the technology ? again more questions			2
in an effort to answer some of these , the @entity133 has set up a £ 10m ( $ 16m ) fund to look at how driverless cars can be integrated into everyday life in the @entity0			1
that sounds great , except £ 10m barely gets you off the driveway in car industry terms			0
a major manufacturer such as @entity143 will spend 100 times that just on marketing a new model			0
let 's assume the government does find some answers , will mrs @entity147 really be able to trust her car to take @entity152 and @entity153 to school ? what happens if @entity153 starts feeling sick ? or @entity152 's left his maths homework on the kitchen table ? i 'd hazard a computer will struggle with those little everyday challenges that we humans absorb so brilliantly			2
perhaps more importantly , is just how much control we would cede			0
i would be happy to let a car do the driving in a slow - moving motorway traffic jam			0
i 'm not sure about driverless cars in a congested urban environment			1
and i 'm even less certain about having cars running around without a capable driver even in them			0
@entity8 is right : driverless cars could be transformational			1
but at the moment , there are too many questions to know if that 's going to be in a good way .			0

the @entity0 government has *announced* a £ 10 million fund to *research* driverless cars
transport minister @entity4 says the technology could be " transformational "
but @entity186 says driverless cars are programed but humans are random
driverless cars sharing the road with human - driven vehicles could be chaotic , he says
