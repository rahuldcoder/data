-- before the interview for @entity4 , all i knew about @entity2 was that he sings love songs -- and that the ladies seem to love him			1
what i did n't know , was this is a man who was born to be famous and not even a life - threatening injury from a car accident would stop him			1
his story is one made for the silver screen			2
it has all the elements that tug at your heart strings : family drama , near - death experience , triumph over adversity , ultimate success , and a plot that just keeps on going			1
@entity2 ' renowned voice has made him a superstar worldwide but his first foray into the spotlight was n't through his voice , it was his feet			1
the football pitch was where he got his first taste of what it feels like to be adored by the crowds			2
real deal from a young age , @entity2 showed his fancy footwork in @entity42 's junior league			1
rising through the ranks , he would eventually become goalkeeper for @entity42 's reserve team			2
@entity2 humbly admits he was never a real football talent but he had the discipline which would see him play with the biggest names of that generation			1
while his dream to play for the @entity54 would never be realized , just being in close proximity to the players and playing in the same stadium was enough to feel the call of something big			2
" you feel 50,000 people in the stadium and you go on the grass and the magic starts			2
you feel like are something else			0
all the dreams that you have for years come back in a reality and you are in front of so many people playing a match and you win , you lose			0
it 's passion , it 's courage , " he said			0
accident perhaps it 's that courage that saw him through one of the most challenging times of his life			1
when he was 19 , a drive home after a party with two friends ended in tragedy			0
while taking a curve in the road , the car he was driving crashed , leaving him clinging on to life			1
what would come would crush his dreams of ever playing football again			0
the crash compressed a nerve in his spine leaving him paralyzed from the chest down ; a paralysis that would see him bed - ridden for two years			1
" all i felt at that time was ' why ? why has this happened to me ? ' " i 'm someone who believes there 's a reason for everything			0
sometimes that belief is challenged but more often than not , i believe events take place that force you to think , feel , and act in ways you may never have before			0
i believe people come into your life for a reason			1
" for @entity2 , that belief was crystallized in that devastating moment , and those challenging two years changed his life			1
what he did not realize at the time was that it would all change for the better			0
musical discovery a nurse who was treating him brought @entity2 a guitar			1
the gesture was two-fold : a distraction from the depression of what kind of a life would lie ahead , and a means to exercise the dexterity and strength in his fingers and hands			1
he discovered a passion for music that he did n't know he had			0
and perhaps more than anything , a renewed purpose in life			1
" i started to move my toes			0
i started to get up , i started to walk albeit painfully , and i started to realize that i could survive ... i started to think that i could be alive again ... so from that day i took chances			0
without discipline i would not be here			0
i would not be talking to you , i would not be a singer , and i would be nothing			0
@entity140 woke up my life again			2
" the rest as they say is history			0
devoted following eighty albums released in 14 languages , over 300 million records sold worldwide , and a devoted following of women who hear that something in his voice that knows no boundaries of language			1
despite claiming to be " not that great " of a singer , @entity2 ' ability to connect to a global audience has served him well			1
he says it 's his passion for music and for people			0
perhaps , though , what they see is his vulnerability , a quality he himself says " is the most attractive thing that an artist can have			0
" " since that time i understood that music , and the passion for music , was my life ... i was not a good singer , i did n't even know how to write a song ... but i realized what an incredible opportunity i had			2
the life came back to my eyes and i became a singer			2

heart throb @entity2 tells how his life was changed be a car crash
former footballer was paralyzed from the chest down by a near - fatal car crash in his teens
he says his life was changed when a nurse gave him a guitar as he *convalesced*
he has since produced 80 albums and sold over 300 million records sold worldwide
