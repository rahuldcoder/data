-- the @entity1 , a partnership between @entity3 and @entity4 , took over the @entity6 neighborhood of @entity7 , @entity8 , on october 15 and 16 to continue its mission to bring art , music and tech together in exciting and unexpected ways			2
in addition to installations like @entity18 's " @entity17 " revisited by @entity19 and @entity20 , a cocoon of light and sound by filmmaker @entity24 and @entity26 's @entity25 , interconnected floor panels by @entity28 and @entity29 that undulate when you walk on them and the massive , responsive light cube by @entity33 , there were films by @entity35 and @entity36 as well as a screening of @entity39 's user - generated film " @entity40			2
" as part of the weekend 's festivities , @entity41 premiered her psycho - opera " stop the @entity47 , " a widely anticipated performance piece that has been in the works for nearly seven years			1
when the lights come up on the stage , @entity41 , in a headdress and long red and white robe , appeared behind a screen projected with bare trees and snow falling up			1
" let 's begin at the end " she sang before taking the audience though a journey of darkness , innocence , falls from grace , lobster claws , poisoned eucharist and everyone 's eventual redemption			0
" since the music was written it called out to be something more ; even though i still ca n't describe exactly what it is we have created , i ca n't imagine it being anything else , nor can i see a more perfect collective of artists and friends answering that call , " @entity41 wrote in the program			1
the stunning performance is directed by playwright @entity79 and features production design by @entity81 ( " @entity83 , " " @entity82 " ) , costumes by @entity41 's longtime wardrobe collaborator @entity91 , music by her @entity89 bandmates @entity84 and @entity85 and an appearance by @entity87			1
it is playing at @entity94 through october 22			0
the other showstopper came from @entity96			1
in the @entity98 under the @entity99 , the band debuted songs from its upcoming album " @entity102 " ( due november 1 )			1
dressed in a sheer button - down shirt and long skirt , the flame - headed @entity104 belted out new numbers , " @entity108 , " " @entity103 , " " @entity109 " and the previously released single " @entity110			2
" @entity111 and @entity111 of @entity111 played a dj set at the event and gave a small preview of their new album " @entity115 , " ( due october 24 ) , but nothing too much			1
@entity117 explained : " when we started to make this record , we noticed that electronic music was being portrayed as music for the night and the cities			0
we wanted to make a record for the day and the countryside			0
so if you listen to this album as electronic music for @entity129 , it may be a little bit of a disturbing experience			2
" nevertheless , the group maintains " @entity115 " came out of the same intentions and the same obsessions as their first album , the hard - driving " †			1
" " we thought we could express the same kind of feelings but in a different way , " @entity138 said			0
" sometimes you do n't have to be blatantly aggressive to be powerful			0
" of the 11 tracks on the album , @entity117 and @entity111 's favorite is " @entity143			1
" " most people think it 's an interlude , " @entity138 said			0
" it 's not dancey , there 's no vocals , it 's not pop. there 's nothing , but this track was really important to us			0
we made it halfway through the album and when we made it , we knew we had the sound of the record			2
we stepped back from ( what was already recorded ) and made everything sound like this track			0
i think it 's the least favorite track of people , but it 's the template for the whole record			0
