-- november 18 , 2009 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity14 , @entity15 : hi , i 'm @entity17			2
first up : @entity19 @entity20 : first up , @entity21 considers a new bill that would make some soldiers eligible for the @entity19			2
representative @entity24 introduced the new legislation yesterday			2
the @entity26 is located in his home district in @entity28 , and this bill is focused on the victims of the recent shooting there			2
the @entity19 , first created in 1782 , is given to any @entity33 service member who is wounded or killed while serving in action against an enemy or in a terrorist attack			1
representative @entity24 says the @entity26 victims deserve the @entity19 because he considers the shooting to be an enemy attack			2
@entity40 @entity20 : @entity41 has a big role on the international scene			1
the country is a major part of the talks about @entity48 's controversial nuclear program , and it holds one of the five permanent seats on the @entity51			1
@entity52 fills us in on what happened when president @entity55 met with @entity41 president @entity56 yesterday			1
( begin video ) @entity58 : in @entity60 's bitter cold , president @entity55 was all about showcasing a new warmth with @entity41 as he toured the historic @entity62 and its @entity63			1
@entity33 president @entity55 : it 's beautiful			1
what a magnificent place to visit			2
@entity58 : by the end of this week , mr. @entity55 will have visited 20 nations , the most in the first year of any @entity33 president , though he told @entity41 president @entity56 in the ornate @entity69 their relationship may be most pivotal of all			1
@entity55 : in this young century , the jobs we do , the prosperity we build , the environment we protect , the security that we seek , all these things are shared			0
@entity58 : it was not , however , all sweetness and light			0
while mr. @entity55 avoided a meeting with the @entity82 in @entity83 last month to not ruffle feathers before this visit , here in @entity60 , he gently but publicly pushed the @entity41 to cool tensions with the @entity89 spiritual leader			1
@entity55 : while we recognize that @entity91 is part of the @entity41 , the @entity33 supports the early resumption of dialogue between the @entity41 government and representatives of the @entity82 to resolve any concerns and differences that the two sides may have			1
@entity58 : and while they spoke of broad economic cooperation , @entity56 slapped at the @entity33 for recently hitting @entity41 tires and steel with new levies			1
@entity56 , @entity41 [ @entity105 ] : our two countries need to oppose and reject protectionism and all its manifestations in an even stronger stand			1
@entity58 : but the world 's two biggest emitters of greenhouse gases vowed to work together to get concrete action on climate change at a summit next month in @entity116			1
@entity55 : an accord that covers all of the issues in the negotiations and one that has immediate operational affect			0
this kind of comprehensive agreement would be an important step forward in the effort to rally the world around a solution to our climate challenge			0
@entity58 : but the @entity41 president stopped far short of endorsing tough new sanctions against @entity4 , though both sides are pledging cooperation to stop @entity48 's nuclear program just a couple of days before mr. @entity55 visits @entity134 , the final stop on this long @entity137 journey			1
@entity52 , @entity0 , @entity60			0
( @entity138 ) nuclear concerns @entity20 : all right , mr. @entity52 there mentioned @entity4 's nuclear program			1
that includes a facility that was made public just recently			0
a new report from the @entity145 says the fact @entity4 kept the facility a secret brings up some serious questions			0
for example , are there other facilities @entity4 has n't made public ? under a previous agreement , the country is required to tell the energy agency about them			0
@entity4 says its nuclear program only has peaceful purposes ; other countries believe @entity4 may be trying to build a nuclear weapon			0
that is why the @entity33 is concerned about the program and why it is making this : a massive ordinance penetrator			1
this is a 30,000 - pound bomb that could blast through 60 feet of concrete and potentially damage underground weapons factories			0
the military says it 's building the bomb ; it does n't have any immediate plans to use it			1
@entity171 @entity172 , @entity15 : time for the shoutout ! what is the name of the student - led demonstration that took place in @entity5 in november 1989 ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! was it the : a ) @entity184 , b ) @entity186 , c ) @entity188 or @entity189 ) @entity190 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the @entity188 took place about a week after the fall of the @entity193			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity188 @entity20 : thousands of marchers went out in @entity5 yesterday , celebrating the 20th anniversary of the peaceful uprising			1
it looked something like it did in 1989 , when citizens of @entity203 demonstrated against the country 's communist government and eventually helped to bring it to an end			1
@entity203 would later split into two countries : the @entity6 and @entity209			1
musicians and other artists played major roles in the @entity188 , and yesterday 's rallies in @entity5 wrapped up with a massive concert			1
blog report @entity20 : how do you feel about the government 's decision to try five suspected 9/11 terrorists in a @entity221 civilian court instead of a military tribunal ? monday 's show at @entity224 has a refresher if you need it			1
@entity227 believes the suspects should be tried in a military court			0
" they are not @entity33 citizens and should not be entitled to the same privileges			1
they would still be given a fair trial , " she says			0
" the wounds from 9/11 run deep , " @entity237 says , " and by bringing these suspects back to @entity221 , it would re-open some of these harsh wounds			0
" from @entity250 : " bringing them to @entity242 shows that we are giving them a fair trial ... it 's important to give them the same justice that 's given to everyone			2
" and @entity251 does n't think it matters where they 're tried , just as long as they get tried			0
he thinks they should 've gone to trial years ago			0
the government 's decision , not a popular one : in a recent @entity0 poll , 64 percent said that confessed 9/11 planner @entity262 -- one of the suspects -- should be tried in a military tribunal , not a civilian court			1
rebirth of space @entity20 : @entity268 is n't going anywhere , but its space shuttle program is about to be a thing of the past			0
it 's scheduled to end next year			2
the future of space travel will include private companies that could take you on a trip out of this world			0
one business has already sold 200 tickets for $ 200,000 a each ! do n't know where you 're going to get that , but @entity284 takes us to @entity7 for a look at what could be @entity242 's launch pad			1
( begin video ) @entity290 , @entity0 correspondent : out here in the vast desert of southern @entity7 is where @entity242 's space program was born with pioneers like @entity295 and @entity296			1
and it is here that some believe it is being reborn			0
@entity7 is investing almost $ 300 million in a project known as @entity242 , an airport for commercial space exploration			1
@entity302 , @entity303 , @entity242 : it 's about being visionary , and i think of the state of @entity7 back from the early days of @entity296 , @entity307 , @entity295 , space has always been in the mainstream of what @entity7 is all about			1
and this is just one more step			0
@entity311 : @entity312 will use @entity242 to launch its space tourism business , offering wealthy clients rides into spaces , carried aloft by the @entity317 ii. @entity312 is the largest private partner in this futuristic and futuristic - looking venture in the desert , committing more than $ 200 million in technological development			1
the project broke ground in june ; construction contracts have been awarded			0
over the next year and a half , the state expects construction will provide between 400 and 600 jobs in the middle of nowhere			0
in this field where there is nothing but grassland , cactus and mesquite bushes , a year from now there will be a runway , 10,000 feet by 200 feet , with the spaceport hangar located just over there			2
@entity312 is attention - getting , the headline grabbing stuff			0
but space tourist rides are still a couple of years away			0
small entrepreneurial companies are already busy changing the face of space exploration			0
@entity347 , @entity348 : i think any time you get entrepreneurs getting into the space business or any business , actually , you 'll see some real innovation , because entrepreneurs and companies have to make money with it			0
so , that 's what 's exciting about this			2
you start to see small companies like mine that are actually in this business for money			0
@entity311 : his company is @entity348 , providing low - cost launch facilities at the spaceport to clients like @entity371 , a company involved in space research and manufacturing			1
his launch costs are one - tenth of those of a standard facility , and there 's a fast turnaround time between launches			1
which means engineers like @entity382 can get away from their desk and on to the launch pad			2
@entity385 , @entity386 : that 's huge			2
so , if you can do ten of these vehicles for what it costs to do one mission on a sophisticated military test range , it 's an amazing simplification of your life , just to go out quickly , get the data you need , build another one and try it again			2
@entity311 : @entity348 is just one of several small companies with big ambitions and dreams			0
@entity403 is one of the not - so - small names at @entity242			0
@entity284 , @entity242 , @entity7			1
( @entity138 ) before we go @entity20 : okay , before we go , anyone pondering whether cardboard can float , here 's your answer			2
all it takes is sealing up the cardboard with 16 rolls of duct tape			0
then yar , she be a fine ' sea - goin ' vessel			0
this is actually a part of a science class at a school in @entity420 where students race their boats across the school pond			2
the " @entity425 " came in first place			0
but the paddlers did n't celebrate too quickly			0
goodbye @entity14 : ' cause after all , they did n't want to go overboard in their excitement			0
@entity0 sets sail again tomorrow			0

consider what was said in a meeting between the @entity33 and @entity41 leaders

launch into the plans for a civilian spaceport in the @entity7 desert
