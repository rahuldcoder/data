if the @entity2 truce holds and @entity4 's @entity3 comes to its conclusion , some things are certain			0
both @entity4 and @entity6 will declare military victory -- @entity4 pointing to the destruction of militants ' tunnels and depletion of @entity6 ' rocket supply ; @entity6 pointing to dozens of dead @entity4 troops and the survival of @entity6 leadership in @entity2			2
but unlike in previous conflicts , when @entity6 had the support of many @entity19 nations , things have changed			2
this time , as @entity22 has reported , the fighting between @entity4 and @entity6 has been a proxy war for the @entity24			0
key regional players @entity27 , @entity28 and @entity29 have their own reasons to want to fend off the @entity31 , of which @entity6 is part , experts say			1
and @entity34 , like the @entity33 , lists @entity6 as a terrorist organization for its numerous attacks on civilians			0
but the group does have the support of some countries			0
" it 's no longer the @entity46 against the @entity47 , " said @entity41 , vice president of foreign and defense policy studies at the @entity44			0
" now it 's the extremists -- the @entity31 , @entity6 , @entity50 , and their backers @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54 -- against @entity4 and the more moderate @entity46 including @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29			1
" a look at some key @entity6 supporters : @entity54 prime minister @entity57 openly supports @entity6			1
" @entity57 has tried to use the cause of the @entity31 to bolster his own @entity62 credentials at home , " says @entity58 , of the @entity59			0
@entity54 also has " more of an ideological sympathy with the @entity31 , " @entity58 says			0
@entity53 @entity53 supported the @entity31 in @entity28 -- which was toppled from power in a coup last year			1
@entity53 funds many @entity31 figures in exile , including @entity6 political leader @entity69 , who is believed to have orchestrated numerous terrorist attacks			1
" @entity53 has a long history of providing shelter to @entity62 groups , amongst them the @entity31 and the @entity77 , " @entity71 of the @entity72 tells @entity73			0
advocating for @entity6 is beneficial to @entity54 and @entity53 in their political objectives because the cause draws popular support at home , says world affairs writer @entity82 in a @entity22 column			1
but some question whether @entity53 's support for @entity6 is still strong			1
the country 's financial support to the group " largely dried up " as @entity53 sought " to mend ties with its neighbors , with whom it had fallen out in part for backing the @entity31 in @entity28 , " the @entity86 said			1
while @entity53 and @entity54 are powerful allies , " @entity6 might wish for more support given the breadth of the @entity19 world , " @entity73 reported			1
@entity52 and @entity98 in the past , @entity52 and @entity98 supported @entity6			1
@entity52 supplied the group with weapons ; @entity98 was home to @entity69			1
but @entity69 did not support @entity98 president @entity102 in the country 's civil war			2
in 2012 , @entity69 left for @entity53 , causing a breakdown in his relationship with both @entity98 and its ally @entity52 , says @entity108 , head of @entity24 and @entity109 and forecasting at the global information company @entity111			1
and while @entity52 still professes to support @entity6 , such claims " are more ostentatious , showy , exaggerated and theatrical rather than genuine and practical , " writes @entity114 , an @entity52 - @entity33 scholar at @entity115 , in a column for @entity117			1
@entity52 , which is a muslim but not an @entity19 nation , " uses @entity6 ( as well as @entity120 's support for the @entity122 cause ) as a tool to project its power and influence in the @entity19 world , " he argues			1
the @entity86 says @entity52 , while cutting its funding to @entity6 in recent years , " sought to bolster its ties to other resistance groups in the region , such as @entity132			2
" @entity50 the @entity135 militant group based in @entity135 is aligned with @entity102 's regime in @entity98			2
during the conflict , @entity50 reached out to @entity6 , praising its " steadfastness			0
" this does not mean the relationship is repaired to where it stood before @entity98 's civil war , but " a new realignment might happen , " @entity139 of the @entity140 told @entity73			2
popular support @entity6 ' greatest support in the wake of the conflict with @entity4 may be from the public in @entity2 and other parts of the @entity19 world			1
" @entity6 is not a monolith , nor is it only a terrorist group , " @entity154 of the @entity86 writes on @entity22			0
" it is a social movement , with a mass membership , a popular message of resistance that resonates across the @entity127 world , and a political party with which we must negotiate			0
" some analysts believe @entity6 will emerge stronger from the fight with @entity4			2
the conflict " will only further radicalize the @entity122 population -- and alienate frustrated friends in the @entity33 , " @entity165 of @entity166 argues			0
before @entity3 , a poll by the @entity59 found that most @entity122 in @entity2 oppose a two - state solution and want to work toward abolishing @entity4 -- a goal that is in line with @entity6 ' charter			0
but the poll also found most @entity122 support nonviolent methods of achieving their goals			0
support could affect arms supply while @entity6 ' recruitment might soar now , militarily the group " is on the ropes , " with tunnels destroyed and much of its rocket supply depleted , writes @entity179 , retired @entity33 @entity180 intelligence officer and @entity22 military analyst			2
" after similar conflicts in the past , @entity6 has been rearmed and resupplied by its supporters , primarily @entity52 and to some extent @entity98			1
the most efficient method for the rearming and resupply effort has been via the large number of smuggling tunnels between @entity2 and @entity28 's @entity197			0
" that is not likely to be the case this time -- another blow to @entity6 , which it must factor in to its assessment of this conflict as well as its future planning			0
" what is @entity6 ' endgame in @entity2 ? what is @entity4 's endgame in @entity2 ?			0

@entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 do *n't* support @entity6 , analysts say
@entity54 and @entity53 do ; some question the extent of @entity53 's support
@entity52 and @entity98 had a falling out with @entity6
popular support may spike , but weapon supply is *limited* , analysts say
