@entity0 -- a @entity3 committee delivered a split verdict on the diabetes drug @entity6 on wednesday , with most members voting to leave it on the market but recommending different changes in how it 's prescribed			1
twelve of the committee 's 33 members voted to pull @entity6 off the market altogether , while only three supported leaving it on the market with its current labeling			1
@entity19 voted to add stiffer warnings to the current label , and 10 wanted both stiffer language and restrictions on its use			0
the vote came on the second day of hearings into the safety of the drug , which studies since 2007 have linked to an increased risk of heart failure			0
one member abstained , and several said their votes easily could have gone another way			0
" i think the evidence of potential harm is stronger now than it was in 2007 , " said dr. @entity35 , the director of the @entity37 's epidemiology division , who voted for stronger warnings and restrictions			0
" i think if the drug is to remain on the market , we need to consider whether there would be some specific indications in which it would be reserved for use			0
it seems to me that simply putting a warning , a black - box warning , in the labeling is probably not sufficient to really protect patients			0
" @entity3 officials will make a decison on what to do with the medication " as soon as possible , " said @entity59 , director of the agency 's @entity60			2
avandia manufacturer @entity62 has insisted on the safety of the medication , which is used to control blood sugar levels in diabetics			2
but a company - sponsored study that @entity62 said showed there was no higher risk of heart problems came under heavy fire from @entity3 researchers during proceedings tuesday and wednesday			1
in a statement issued after the vote , @entity62 reiterated its belief in the safety of the drug and said @entity6 " remains available to physicians and appropriate patients " to treat type 2 diabetes			1
" following today 's recommendations , we will , of course , continue to work with the @entity3 in the best interest of diabetes patients who face this chronic and serious disease , " dr. @entity83 , the company 's chief medical officer , said in the statement			1
" patients taking @entity6 should speak with their physician about their treatment and any questions they may have regarding the safety of the medicine			1
" but dr. @entity97 , president of the @entity98 , said the decision was " hardly a ringing endorsement " of the drug			1
in two preliminary votes , the @entity3 panel found that @entity6 has an increased risk of heart problems compared with other drugs -- but it made the same determination in 2007 without voting to pull the drug , recommending stronger warnings instead			1
the committee would not conclude the drug poses an increased risk of death , with most calling the data before them insufficient			0
" until we have a longer - term follow - up we just ca n't say much about mortality , " said committee member @entity114 , a @entity115 medical professor			0
before the vote , @entity118 , who suffers from type 2 diabetes , told the panel he has been taking @entity6 for 10 years and ca n't take an alternative drug because of his physical limits on exercise			2
" in making this plea to keep @entity6 on the market , i believe i am pleading for my life , " @entity118 said			2
for people in his position , he said , " a negative position on @entity6 may be a death sentence			2
" a strongly worded @entity3 report last week called @entity62 's record study , which the company cites as evidence of the drug 's safety , " inappropriate and biased			1
" it accused @entity62 of repeatedly submitting sloppy data and failing to follow up on reports of problems among patients , including deaths			2
and dr. @entity144 , the author of a june study that also found higher risk of heart problems among @entity6 users , said the @entity151 study would have been dismissed as " garbage " if it had been used to seek the drug 's original approval			2
but dr. @entity155 , @entity62 's vice president for clinical development , said tuesday that the company 's studies " provide the most robust and reliable data " to assess @entity6 's safety -- and those studies have found " no evidence to suggest " the drug increases the risk of heart problems			1
@entity155 defended the @entity151 study again wednesday			0
@entity62 says several trials have shown @entity6 is safe , but its usage has fallen sharply since a 2007 study that linked it to an increased risk of heart attacks and other related problems			1
published estimates indicate annual sales of @entity6 have dropped from about $ 3 billion in 2006 to about $ 1 billion			0
a @entity174 committee added to the controversy tuesday			0
its leaders released documents they said show @entity62 " failed to publish studies that found serious health risks associated with @entity6 in a timely manner and actively promoted the drug despite the known safety concerns			1
" the documents , which the @entity184 provided to the @entity3 , include studies that date back to 2000 , the committee 's @entity187 chairman and ranking @entity189 said			0
but in an e-mail , @entity62 spokeswoman @entity190 told @entity1 the new documents were " a small subset " of millions of pages the company released in connection with lawsuits over the drugs			0
" they include drafts and other documents taken out of context , which therefore are incomplete and misleading , " @entity199 said			0
" the documents do not offer new clinically relevant scientific information , and do not provide the full extent of @entity62 's studies and evaluation of @entity6			1

new : the decision is " hardly a ringing endorsement , " doctor says
most panelists recommend @entity6 stay on the market with restrictions
@entity62 says @entity6 remains available to " appropriate " patients
@entity3 promises to issue a decision " as soon as possible "
