-- a 21 - year - old @entity3 man has been charged with stealing samples of the brains of dead mental patients from a medical museum , authorities said thursday			1
the specimens were allegedly later sold online			2
the man , identified as @entity12 , allegedly stole more than 60 jars of brain and other human tissues in early october from a warehouse space at the @entity17 , the @entity10 prosecutor 's office said in court papers thursday			1
@entity12 was arrested december 16 on felony theft and other charges			2
@entity12 is to appear an @entity3 court later this month in connection with the alleged theft of dozens of jars of preserved human brain tissue valued at about $ 4,800			1
court documents said some jars were sold on the auction site @entity29 by a middleman , despite a company policy against listing " humans , the human body , or any human body parts or products			1
" attempts to reach @entity12 on thursday were unsuccessful			0
he declined to comment when seen outside his @entity3 home by a reporter with @entity0 affiliate @entity40			2
the alleged scheme began to unravel when the executive director of the museum , @entity42 , received a call last month from a man in @entity46 who said he had purchased " six jars of brain matter " for $ 600 on @entity29 , according to court documents			1
the man suspected the jars were stolen when he compared them to others on the museum website			1
@entity42 said the @entity46 man collected oddities			2
the specimens he bought were stolen from a warehouse space on the museum campus , where thousands of jars of brain and other human tissue from autopsies performed on patients at the now - defunct @entity65 for the @entity66 in the 1890s were stored			1
" apparently that 's a trend that 's building -- the macabre , the oddities , " @entity42 said			0
" the television reality show ' oddities ' illustrates that very well			0
i think it 's indicative of people 's collecting interests			0
it 's infuriating that they do not have respect for the human remains			0
" in the universe of bizarre items that @entity85 users sell on @entity29 -- host to millions of auctions each day -- human organs are forbidden			1
to buy or sell them is a felony under federal law , and trading in illegal goods is a violation of @entity29 's rules			1
the list of prohibited items includes @entity98 grave - related items such as skulls and skeletons intended for medical research , @entity104 prayer skulls , organs , bones , blood , waste products , body fluids and sperm			2
police determined that the buyer on @entity29 had received the brains from a middleman who allegedly got them from @entity12			1
@entity12 was arrested during a sting after allegedly agreeing to sell jars of brains to an undercover officer at a @entity121 , police said			2
@entity122 , a professor of medical anthropology at the @entity124 , and director of organs watch , a program that researches human organ trafficking around the world , said the sale of the organs of deceased people was uncommon compared to a thriving , worldwide trade in illegal organ sales of living people			1
that trend has been fueled by the @entity85 and a global shortage of organs for transplants			0
" wherever there 's an @entity85 , people are trying to sell organs , " @entity122 said			0
@entity12 also was charged with marijuana possession and possession of paraphernalia			0
additional charges are possible , @entity144 , spokesman for the @entity10 prosecutor 's office , said without elaborating			0
the @entity17 is on the grounds of what used to be the @entity149 of @entity150 , according to the museum 's website			0
@entity150 was opened in 1848 as a " hospital for the insane " and closed in 1994 , according to the @entity155 on @entity157 website			0
" we have thousands of pieces in the warehouse and we 're still checking against our inventory , " @entity42 said .			0
