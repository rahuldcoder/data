-- @entity1 is said to have sobbed like a child after realizing there were no more worlds to conquer			1
this was centuries before video games -- with the exception of " @entity9 " -- were invented			1
had he owned @entity10 , @entity11 or @entity12 , @entity1 would probably have stayed on his sofa in @entity14 instead of leading his armies as far as the @entity16			1
and who would 've blamed him ? these days virtual worlds are almost as impressive as the real thing			2
so impressive , in fact , that we wish we could visit them			2
these seven would top our itinerary			2
more : ' @entity26 ' tours in @entity27 and @entity28 @entity29 , " @entity30 : @entity31 " ( @entity32 ) the place : a bucolic world of grassy plains and medieval settlements that echo the gentle sounds of clopping hooves , lilting ocarina melodies and a talking tree			2
why we want to visit : certainly not for the bafflingly complex plotline -- a brackish mix of disneyfied fairytale and @entity46 faceoffs that revolve around an antediluvian flute			2
we 're there chiefly for the game 's mesmerizing horseback riding scenes , in which entire afternoons can be lost cantering gaily across pleasant grasslands to little discernible purpose			1
get real : horse trekking in the @entity57 steppes , where you can enjoy a vast fence - free wilderness from the saddle without the tedious obligation to conquer evil			2
@entity63 ; +976 991 14245 more : @entity67 's genius @entity65 - themed safety video @entity69 , " @entity68 " ( @entity70 ) the place : a sun - bleached @entity73 state that stretches from sparkling ocean - side real estate to misty mountainside			1
here there are wide shopping boulevards patrolled by the wealthy , and cracked asphalt byways where lives lie in ruin			2
it 's a bogglingly panoramic slice of the @entity73 dream			1
why we want to visit : @entity69 vividly re-creates great swathes of @entity86 , chiefly @entity87 , with such an immersive eye for detail that , if they were n't so loathsome , you might accidentally find its characters on your @entity94 card list			2
if you can stomach the obscene violence , " @entity68 's " vision of the @entity97 is infinitely better than reality since you dispense with envy and help yourself to whatever you want , be it fast cars , speedboats or passenger jets			1
and , just to prove it 's even more la - la than @entity107 , you can finish off your crime spree with a yoga session			1
get real : hire ( do n't hijack ) a luxury car and cruise across @entity87			2
@entity112 ; +1 310 274 6969 " @entity113 " ( @entity114 ) the place : a @entity117 - created , two - dimensional world where doom can only be avoided by neatly stacking descending geometric shapes			2
could be an allegory for the futilities of the @entity117 's collective economy			1
could be just a maddeningly addictive game			2
why we want to visit : modern life draws great delight from plunging us into nerve - jangling chaos			0
it takes even greater mirth in our feeble attempts to impose order on this chaos			0
so to spend time in a place where the very building blocks of existence can easily be shuffled into orderly stacks is to enter a place of @entity139 - like sanctuary -- a place where nirvana is an l - shaped block slotted tidily in an l - shaped hole			0
get real : play " @entity113 " too much and it becomes hard not to gaze at a cityscape without figuring out which shapes would fit into its gaps			0
this is especially fun in the @entity150 heights of @entity152 's mid-levels			1
butterfly on @entity153 ( @entity152 ) ; +852 2850 8899 more : @entity154 , and 9 other things @entity156 does better than anyplace else @entity159 , " @entity158 " ( @entity160 ) the place : a gloomy sub-aquatic metropolis deep beneath the @entity163			1
according to an elaborate back story , the city was conceived in the late 1940s by idealists who wanted to break away from outmoded ideologies at the end of @entity169 so they construct an underwater utopia where all runs swimmingly until everyone , of course , becomes hopelessly hooked on sea slugs			0
why we want to visit : it may be a decaying dystopia populated by genetically modified beasts , but who cares when it looks this good ? " @entity158 's " designers spliced @entity187 's " @entity186 " with the @entity182 to create an art deco spectacle that drips with class ( and seawater )			1
get real : underwater cities are sadly somewhat thin on the ground			0
( or should that be ocean floor ? ) for now , you have to make do with just an underwater hotel room			0
the @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 ; +255 776 718 852 ; $ 1,500 per night for a two - person stay , $ 900 per night for singles " @entity198 " ( @entity32 ) the place : a universe of tiny planets where , if you eat the right mushrooms , you gain special powers that make it easier to navigate a series of benign but frustratingly tricky challenges			1
why we want to visit : we 'd settle for any of the mildly psychedelic destinations depicted in the " @entity211 " games series , but " @entity212 " is the best yet			1
it 's incredibly pleasant to look at and , in an age of ever - increasing video game violence , feels warm , safe and unthreatening			1
of course , traveling to strange places with a qualified plumber can only be a good thing			0
particularly one whose " let 's a-go " catchphrase seems to indicate a tradesman with an admirable can - do attitude			1
get real : warm , safe and unthreatening ? welcome to @entity224 ! but under no circumstances sample mushrooms offering unusual powers			0
not even a plumber would be able to help you			0
@entity230 ( @entity224 ) ; +65 6521 9000 " @entity231 " ( @entity232 ) the place : a blank map waiting to be charted by you			0
" @entity231 " is considered by many to be the best so - called " sandbox " game in which players design their own block - built worlds and mine their resources to construct elaborate settlements			0
hostile mobs and monsters are chucked in to liven things up			0
why we want to visit : because we 've all felt the call of the wild at least once in our lives			0
a sense of frontier spirit			0
the desire to wipe the slate clean , forge our own new civilizations and get our hands if not dirty , then perhaps a little clammy			0
get real : @entity256 deep into any wilderness and you might stumble into fanatics so disillusioned with government interference and the triviality of modern life that they 're trying to start again			0
after reading this article , many more may join them			0
thankfully , in the rugged expanses of @entity269 's @entity268 , there 's room for everyone			1
@entity272 , +1 867 695 7750 more : all by my selfie			0
travel blogger fakes girlfriend pics @entity277 , " @entity279 " ( @entity278 ) the place : a jagged , windswept and snowy mountain range on the northern fringes of the northern fringes of " @entity279 " -- the colossal online realm that at its peak had as many signed - up players as @entity287 has citizens			1
why we want to visit : " @entity279 " boasts such a bewildering number of territories that it 's hard to know where to start , but the starkly beautiful storm peaks stand out for sheer drama of landscape			1
the peaks are said to be inhabited by a mysterious race of giants			1
but if you 're going to get involved in a fantasy role - playing game where people take things like dragons , spells , elves and occasional outbreaks of plague seriously , these are probably the least of your worries			0
get real : @entity312 is a vertiginous , wind - raked mountain ridge that looms over @entity315 's @entity314			1
dragons would be the least of your worries up here			0
@entity317 guided walks ; +44 1314 668152			0

" @entity158 " splices @entity187 's " @entity186 " with @entity182 to create art deco @entity159
starkly beautiful " @entity279 " storm peaks stand out for sheer drama of landscape
of the mildly psychedelic destinations in the " @entity211 " series , " @entity212 " is best yet
