why wait for the @entity6 ? let 's start the @entity0 - @entity9 smack talk now			1
sunday 's preeminent football game is more than just the @entity11 against the @entity12			1
it also pits two northern coastal cities against each other in a clash of cultures : @entity18 , @entity19 vs. loggers , tweed vs. flannel , " wicked pissah " vs. " hey , the mountain is out			0
" which burg is better ? we 've come up with a highly unscientific scorecard			0
let 's break it down : sure , the @entity30 helped free us from @entity32 rule and all , but how could we survive without our daily coffee ? score : @entity9 1 , @entity0 0 no contest here			1
score : @entity9 1 , @entity0 1 " singles , " that ode to @entity9 's early - ' 90s grunge scene , has n't aged as well as the @entity39 - @entity38 bromance			1
how do you like them apples ? score : @entity0 2 , @entity9 1 they 're both worthy , but @entity48 may be the most influential rock band of the past 25 years			1
score : @entity0 2 , @entity9 2 junior was amazing , but he never hit .406			1
score : @entity0 3 , @entity9 2 what would you rather listen to : someone shouting " the @entity32 are coming ! " or " @entity55 " ? score : @entity0 3 , @entity9 3 baked beans are tasty			1
but they never led the @entity59 in scoring , won an mvp award and brought tears to the eyes of moms everywhere			0
score : @entity9 4 , @entity0 3 sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name			2
score : @entity9 4 , @entity0 4 once the tallest structure west of the @entity72 , the 605 - foot - tall @entity70 is built to withstand winds of up to 200 miles per hour and has a revolving restaurant on top with views of @entity77			2
the @entity78 has 294 steps			0
score : @entity9 5 , @entity0 4 i like big butts and i can not lie			2
score : @entity9 6 , @entity0 4 @entity84 gave us @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			2
score : @entity9 6 , @entity0 5 both cities serve a mean clam / fish chowder , but let 's be honest : @entity0 's is the original -- and more fun to pronounce			1
get your chowdah heah ! score : @entity9 6 , @entity0 6 four months after it opened to traffic in 1940 , the @entity101 collapsed in 40 - mph winds			0
but @entity104 and the infamous ' 86 @entity105 were one strike away from winning the @entity107			0
@entity0 7 , @entity9 6 by our scoring , venerable @entity0 comes out on top -- barely -- over its upstart @entity112 rival			0
let 's hope the actual @entity6 is this close .			0
