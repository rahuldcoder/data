@entity0 -- workers aboard the @entity4 were pushing to complete the well at the heart of the @entity8 oil spill before the disaster , but no " conscious decision " to cut corners on safety has been discovered , a presidential commission reported monday			1
" there seemed to be a compulsion to get this rig completed in that april 19th - april 20th time period , " said @entity13 , the commission 's co-chairman			1
" and as a result of that , a number of things which might have made the outcome of this plight different were deferred or abandoned			2
" the undersea gusher erupted with an april 20 explosion aboard the @entity4 drill rig , which was completing a well for the oil giant @entity29 at the time of the blast			1
the rig sank two days later , taking 11 men to a watery grave and unleashing the worst oil spill in @entity37 history			1
the well was about 45 days behind schedule , and @entity39 , the commission 's chief counsel , said @entity29 's operating costs for the leased rig were running about $ 1.5 million per day			1
those costs were " overhanging the heads of people on the rigs , " @entity39 said -- " but they do n't want their buddies to get killed , or themselves			2
" " to date , we have not seen a single instance where a human being made a conscious decision to favor dollars over safety , " he said			1
but as the commission opened two days of new hearings into the disaster on monday , @entity13 questioned why the timing was " so central " to managers that they did not examine the well 's cementing job more closely			2
" i would hope that tomorrow we get down to the question of just what was driving for a decision on that particular narrow 24 hours , " added @entity13 , a former @entity37 senator and @entity62 governor			0
in its preliminary findings , the commission criticized @entity29 for shifting its plans for capping the completed well			1
at one point , one of the " company men " on the doomed rig was unaware of changes being planned back on shore , staff attorney @entity69 said			2
@entity76 , @entity29 's executive vice president for safety , told the commission he and the company " do n't exactly agree " with the findings			1
" in our work we went through what turned out to be the eight critical things we thought had contributed causally here , " he said			0
" we clearly identified the failure to isolate at the bottom of the well and the negative test and , subsequently , the monitoring , so we did n't see the procedures here as particular to that			2
we felt they were covered in the other things that we described			0
" rep. @entity94 , @entity95 , an outspoken critic of @entity29 , said the company has " a long and sordid history of cutting costs and pushing the limits in search of higher profits			1
" " when the culture of a company favors risk - taking and cutting corners above other concerns , systemic failures like this oil spill disaster result without direct decisions being made or tradeoffs being considered , " @entity94 said in a written statement on monday 's findings			1
the @entity95 @entity113 leads the @entity116 's energy and environmental subcommittee			0
still pending are test results on the rig 's blowout preventer , the massive fail - safe device that was supposed to shut down the well in case emergency			0
federal authorities took control of the preventer in september and have turned it over to a @entity126 engineering firm to analyze the device " from soup to nuts , " @entity39 said			0
@entity29 , rig owner @entity130 and cement contractor @entity132 have pointed fingers at each other since the rig sank			1
as the well 's owner , @entity29 was responsible for capping the ruptured well and cleaning up the more than 200 million gallons of oil that spilled			1
the well was sealed temporarily in @entity141 and capped permanently on september 19			0
lab test results should have prompted managers to redesign the cement slurry used to line the well , the committee reported			2
in addition , the @entity130 drill crew also could have diverted the escaping hydrocarbons overboard or triggered the rig 's emergency disconnect before the blast , which could have shut in the well and " limited the impact of any explosion and / or the blowout , " the commission stated			2
managers for both @entity29 and @entity130 treated a pressure test as a " complete success " despite repeated signs showing that the cement job was not containing the high - pressure oil and gas , the commission found			1
co-chairman @entity163 , a former head of the @entity164 , said the evidence so far indicates a " culture of complacency " on the part of both industry and regulators , including the since - disbanded @entity169			1
" if we had not been complacent , i suppose the most obvious reality is we would not have experienced two full months of a gushing well leading to 200 million gallons being spilled , " @entity163 said			0
" we would not have seen @entity175 underfund the regulatory agency consistently over the better part of the last 20 years , and the consequent failure of @entity169 to rise to the challenges posed by technologies that simply became so sophisticated that they scarcely were any match for the people they were regulating			0
" the commission 's final report is due january 11			0
investigations are also under way by the @entity189 , several congressional committees and a joint @entity193 - @entity192 board			0
unlike those agencies , however , the presidential commission does not have the power to subpoena witnesses -- an issue @entity39 raised several times			0
" we get a lot of arguments , " he told @entity13 at one point			0
" this is where subpoena power , senator , would be helpful , because it 's going to be hard to resolve those unless i can sit people down in a room in a very professional , gentlemanly way and cross examine them and find out , you know , what 's believable and what 's not believable			0
