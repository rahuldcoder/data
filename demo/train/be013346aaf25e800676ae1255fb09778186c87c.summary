-- in deciding last week to label one third of @entity4 -- fat people -- as diseased , the @entity2 not only went against the advice of its own experts , they also failed to include anyone from fat community in that decision			1
there is a consensus among three groups of people -- those who proudly self - identify as fat , fat studies scholars and advocates of the @entity20 approach -- that the @entity2 is putting profits before people and redoubling its focus on weight and weight loss when that approach has , for decades , failed to produce on its promises			1
it does n't make people thinner or healthier in the long term , and it encourages weight stigma , prejudice and discrimination			2
the @entity2 seems eager to expand weight - loss treatment and convince insurers to reimburse for it			1
@entity37 has two new weight - loss drugs out , with users losing at most only 10 % of their body weight at a monthly cost of $ 100 or more and possible health complications			2
new obesity drug @entity43 to be available to certain patients 2012 : @entity48 - approved diet drug @entity46 available bariatric surgeons would doubtless like to expand insurance reimbursements for the practice of surgically interrupting healthy internal organs			0
and the $ 66 billion per year weight - loss industry has a stake , too			2
( although " weight - loss " industry is a misnomer when so many dieters regain lost weight that repeat customers are a basic part of the industry 's business model			0
) " i can guarantee you that if there was no money to be had in this , the term ' obesity epidemic ' would not exist , " said clinical psychologist @entity64			0
at news of the @entity2 's pronouncement , fat community members started the @entity75 hashtag on @entity76			2
i posted this petition on @entity79			0
the fat community 's oldest civil rights group , the @entity80 , proclaimed a vote of no confidence in the @entity2 and called for " an immediate roundtable discussion that includes higher - weight people from every community			1
" as a result of the @entity2 's decision , fat people who face health challenges will encounter even more weight bias in medical settings and will likely encounter more difficulty obtaining treatment unrelated to weight			1
( the classic story in fat community involves going to the doctor with a sinus headache and being told to lose weight although many people 's stories of medical weight bias are far more dire			1
) weight stigma itself is a direct threat to fat people 's health			1
" overall , it feels like another form of systematic discrimination and oppression , " said blogger @entity109			0
author @entity114 wrote , " for all of our cultural hand - wringing about how much fat people are allegedly costing health insurance companies , the @entity2 sure does n't seem bothered by potentially causing an explosion of unnecessary prescriptions ( and surgeries ! ) among the one - third of @entity4 who are suddenly now ' diseased			1
' " when doctors rely on weight , or a phrenology - era number such as @entity129 , they will misidentify more than half the healthy people as unhealthy , psychologist @entity124 pointed out			0
" they do not seem to understand that calling one - third of the natural variety in a population ' sick ' is a hostile act and undermines the trust that millions of people would otherwise place in their doctors ' advice , " @entity124 said			0
as one petition signer , @entity139 , commented : " my doctor already [ attributes ] all of my health problems to my being fat			0
[ it ] makes me want to avoid seeking health care for any reason			0
" for more than two decades , health professionals who promote the @entity20 concept have argued that a weight focus does no lasting good and much harm to physical and mental health and to fat people 's social status			1
they are finding that a weight - neutral approach based in self - acceptance and social justice yields far superior results for people 's health and happiness			2
people are able to develop enjoyable , sustainable eating and exercise habits and a positive feeling about their bodies			0
if the @entity2 truly cares about the health of fat people , they will end the war on obesity			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			0

the @entity2 classified obesity as a disease
@entity174 : because of the label , fat people will likely encounter more weight bias
she says the @entity2 is focused on profit by focusing on weigh and weigh loss approach
@entity174 : if the @entity2 truly cares about the health of fat people , they will end the war on obesity
