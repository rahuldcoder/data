@entity1 - winning director @entity0 resurfaced monday after plunging to the deepest known point in the world 's oceans in his one - man submersible			1
his history - making solo venture to @entity7 , part of the @entity9 in the western @entity10 , left him feeling " complete isolation from all of humanity , " he said			1
" i felt like i literally in the space of one day have gone to another planet and come back			1
" at more than 10,900 meters ( about 35,800 feet ) , the @entity9 is deeper than @entity15 is tall			2
it has had only two previous human visitors : @entity19 lt. @entity18 and the late @entity21 explorer @entity22 , who descended to that spot in 1960			2
map : @entity9 depth @entity0 is the first to make the trek alone			1
and he did so hours before he was due in @entity28 for the premiere of the 3 - d version of his 1997 blockbuster movie , " @entity32			2
" the man who was also behind " @entity34 " went down in a high - tech vessel , the @entity36 , which he and a group of scientists and engineers constructed in @entity40 over the past eight years			2
the bottom was a " very soft , almost gelatinous , flat plane , almost featureless " and went as far as he could see , @entity0 said , describing the " vast frontier down there			1
" " it 's a completely alien world , " he said			1
but he did not see the kind of large life forms that some might dream up , he said			2
" we 'd all love to think there are giant squid and sea monsters down there			0
we ca n't rule it out , but my bet is there are n't			0
what you 're going to find is these very , very interesting animals , the likes of which we 've never seen before , that have adapted to this extreme environment			0
" opinion : @entity65 on the importance of deep sea exploration in a video feed afterward from a large ship , @entity0 told reporters , " i had this idea that life would adapt , life would be able to adapt to the deepest place			1
but i do n't think we 're seeing that			0
at a microbial level , yes , life is adapting			1
" he said he did not see fish at such depth			0
" the only free swimmers i saw were these little ... shrimplike animals , " scavengers that devour potential food that falls , such as dead fish or whales			0
it 's a cold , dark , " completely black world that 's devoid of sunlight " and warmth , he said			1
animals that far down are usually white with no pigment , he said			0
some have eyes to see bioluminescence , while others have no eyes			0
the full trip took about seven hours , he said			0
while the journey went well , one technical glitch caused a problem , he said			0
the hydraulics prevented him from using a manipulator arm to collect samples to bring back to the surface			1
@entity0 said he 's confident it will be fixed for the next trip			1
this trip is only the beginning , he said			0
horrific tsunamis originate in the depths of the ocean , he said , suggesting that a better understanding could ultimately help societies understand and prepare for such disasters			0
and some believe life may have originated in what are now the oceans ' lowest points , he said			1
so the research could help answer some " fundamental questions			0
" in an era in which anyone can use @entity125 maps to zoom in on a satellite image of any part of the world , " the last frontier that really exists " on @entity131 is the deep ocean , @entity0 said			1
@entity0 reached the point near @entity133 at 7:52 a.m. monday ( 5:52 p.m. et sunday ) , said @entity134 , a spokeswoman for the @entity135 , which is working with @entity0 on the project			1
outfitted with special cameras and robotic arms , @entity36 is able to dive vertically at speeds of 500 to 700 feet per minute and can withstand immense pressure -- up to 16,000 pounds per square inch			2
the descent took 2 hours , 36 minutes			0
" just arrived at the ocean 's deepest pt , " he tweeted at the time			1
" hitting bottom never felt so good			2
" it was n't immediately clear how @entity0 managed to update his @entity149 feed from such depths			1
when astronauts sent tweets from space , they were e-mailed to mission control , where support staff posted them to the astronauts ' @entity149 accounts			0
( but that changed in 2010 , when the @entity161 received a special software upgrade that @entity163 called " the ultimate wireless connection			0
" ) it is estimated that more than 750,000 marine species have not been formally described in scientific literature over the centuries , triple the number of those that have been			0
the figures exclude microbes ; a 2010 marine life census estimates there are up to 1 billion kinds of those			2
at noon ( 10 p.m. et sunday ) , the sub broke through the surface after a quick 70 - minute ascent			0
billionaire businessman and adventurer @entity181 and @entity183 , an experienced submarine pilot , had also sought to make the first solo trip to @entity7			2
the nonprofit @entity185 has announced it will award a $ 10 million prize to the first person to reach the bottom of the @entity9			2
@entity0 said he 's not interested in competing for this prize , or any other , because his mission is purely about scientific research			1
" you know , there 's so much we do n't know , " @entity0 recently told @entity192			1
" i 'm hopeful that we 'll be able to study the ocean before we destroy it			0

it felt like another planet , director @entity0 says
at a microbial level , life is adapting , @entity0 says
the hydraulic *system* did not work , so samples could not be brought back , @entity0 says
he is the first person to dive solo to that spot , the deepest in any of the world 's oceans
