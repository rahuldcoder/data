" go back to sleep			2
" groggy from a night of drinking , that 's precisely what @entity4 did			2
the next morning , @entity4 -- who was 19 at the time -- woke up in a bed that he quickly realized was not his own			1
as his haze lifted , he recognized the woman who ordered him to sleep the night before as a friend of a friend			2
he remembered she asked for a ride home after their mutual friend left the nightclub where they 'd been partying			0
he remembered the woman was pregnant and bought him drinks as a thank you			0
he remembered feeling disoriented , and her suggesting a motel room to sleep it off			0
he even remembered lying down with his pants on , uncomfortable taking them off in front of a stranger , only to awaken later and find the woman straddling him			0
what he did n't remember was saying " yes			0
" the morning after , that familiar voice told him that he could hurt the baby if he put up a fight			0
then , he says , she forced herself on him again			0
a few minutes later it was over			0
one night in a motel twin bed turned into years of self - examination			1
it took some time , and the help of a therapist , to get there : " i was finally able to call it what it was , " he says			2
since then , @entity4 -- a @entity45 based at @entity46 -- has spoken out on behalf of sexual assault victims , in particular men who were victimized by women			1
he did n't seek prosecution of his alleged rapist , but he wants other victims to feel free to talk about sexual assault and pursue justice without shame			1
" i want people to understand that it 's not about how physically strong you are , " he says			0
" we [ men ] are conditioned to believe that we can not be victimized in such a way			0
" according to a 2010 report by the @entity66 , nearly 1 in 5 women and 1 in 71 men in the @entity64 have been raped			1
the actual number is likely higher , experts say , as incidents of sexual violence are severely underreported in the @entity64 -- particularly among male victims			1
experts say any sexual assault victim requires extensive emotional and psychological healing after the incident , but male survivors have a harder time putting words to what happened			1
in 2012 , the @entity81 's @entity80 made a significant stride by redefining rape as : " the penetration , no matter how slight , of the vagina or anus with any body part or object , or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person , without the consent of the victim			0
" the prior definition -- " the carnal knowledge of a female , forcibly and against her will " -- had n't been changed since 1927 , and sexual assault awareness groups say it alienated victims that did n't fit the mold			1
veteran confronts rape , suicide : ' i am angry that others are going through this ' " often , male survivors may be less likely to identify what happened to them as abuse or assault because of the general notion that men always want sex , " says @entity107 , the vice president for @entity108 at @entity109 , an anti-sexual violence organization			1
" males have the added burden of facing a society that does n't believe rape can happen to them ... at all , " says psychotherapist @entity118			0
she says gender roles dictate that males are expected to be strong and self - reliant -- men are viewed as those who seek sexual conquests instead of those who " fend them off			1
" the concept of female - on - male sexual assault has recently gained traction on the web via the ever - provocative entertainer @entity134			1
@entity134 recently revealed shocking details to @entity136 in the @entity137 about his first sexual encounter			2
" he lost his virginity when he was 8 years old , to a local girl who was 14 or 15			2
seriously ? ' yeah , really			0
' he grins and chuckles			0
' it 's different in the country			0
' " @entity145 of @entity146 is one of many writers who took umbrage with this particular anecdote , asking in an article , " why is no one talking about the fact that @entity134 was raped ? " trauma recovery counselor @entity153 says men who experience sexual attention as children , as @entity134 did , often explain it to themselves as " i 'm a stud , i got laid by ... " " they do this in order to feel as if they had some power and say , " she says			2
in addition to this macho posturing , there 's also the hot - for - teacher or - babysitter complex that is a popular motif in modern @entity64 culture			2
@entity171 study in @entity172 delves into why men rape " because of the culture of ' @entity176 ' it can be much more difficult for a male to even recognize that the action is abusive or without consent , " @entity153 says			1
consent , she says , means " being of age , mind , sound body to make an informed decision about whether one would like to become sexually intimate with the other person			0
" children can not consent			0
the chatter over @entity134 comes in tandem with recent research published in the journal @entity190 that says nearly 1 in 10 youths between 14 and 21 years old have reported perpetrating some type of sexual violence in their lifetime			1
the study also found that males and females carried out sexual violence at strikingly similar rates after the age of 18 -- 52 % of males and 48 % of females			1
the study classified sexual violence into a few categories : foresexual or presexual contact ( kissing , touching , etc. against their will ) , coercive sex , attempted rape , and completed rape			1
women were more likely to instigate unwanted foresexual contact			0
for male sexual assault victims of any age , convincing others that they 've been preyed upon is difficult as well			1
experts say the general disparity in physical strength comes into play -- ca n't a man fight off a woman ? " it 's a tough call ; people think men ca n't be raped and they do n't understand that in the confusion no still means no , " says @entity224 , a representative for @entity225 , a national support group for male sexual victimization			1
further muddying the water is the fact that some men can perform sexually , even including orgasm , and still be raped			0
in an article in the @entity237 , @entity238 and @entity239 found that even in men who have not consented to sex , slight stimulation of the genitals or an increase in stress can create erections " even though no speciÔ¨Åc sexual stimulation is present			2
" " ' were you aroused ? ' " is a question posed to male victims , @entity248 says			1
" you do n't hear it with female rape victims			1
it 's an interesting question that men get asked			0
" long - term effects of being sexually assaulted can include post-traumatic stress disorder ( @entity258 ) , substance abuse , avoidance of intimacy or the stark opposite -- hyper - sexuality , says @entity248			2
" some men feel a need to prove their masculinity by becoming hyper - masculine , " @entity264 says			2
as for coping , @entity268 at @entity109 says it 's never too late to reach out for help			0
but with the stigma attached , survivors may not feel comfortable talking to their friends and family because the victims themselves have n't defined their experience as assault			1
for @entity4 , it starts with confronting rape for what it is and sharing experiences			0
" whenever you talk about male survivors , women have it statistically worse , but it 's not a competition -- and we each need our time to talk about it , " he says .			1

female - on - male sexual assault is underreported , according to the @entity66
male victims have a harder time defining what happened to them as assault , experts say
new study shows nearly 1 in 10 youths ( aged 14 - 21 ) have perpetrated sexual violence
