-- @entity1 , which recently overtook the @entity2 as the world 's sixth - largest economy , has been enjoying a lot of positive press			1
it is sealing its reputation as a dynamic place , a fun place , a diverse place -- but , with this last point in particular , the country still suffers black eyes			0
a recent court ruling ordered @entity13 to pay a hefty fine for a song with racist lyrics			1
the song , about a black woman 's hair , led civil rights organizations to sue @entity13 not just because it is offensive but because such pejoratives remain common in @entity1			1
an appeals court in @entity24 ruled december 15 that @entity13 must pay nearly 1.3 million reais ( @entity25 $ 723,000 ) for publishing " @entity27 os @entity26 , " or " look at her hair , " by the singer and comedian @entity28			2
@entity28 , whose real name is @entity33 , is now a federal congressman and was not named in the suit			0
even the judicial process for this case was slow : the song came out more than 15 years ago , and the initial lawsuit was filed in 1997			2
" in the bigger picture , i think the music companies are going to be more careful when they choose music to sell , " said @entity39 , the lawyer for the rights organizations			0
the recent ruling was simply the completion of the monetary part of the case ; the heart of it was decided years ago , and @entity13 has abided by it , the company said			2
" since 1997 , spontaneously , @entity13 removed the track from this product and reissued it in the market , " the company said			1
@entity39 , who recused himself from the case for a period while he served as ombudsman for @entity1 's agency for racial equality , said the ruling comes in an environment where racism lingers			1
@entity28 's song , which he reportedly wrote to his wife , includes lyrics comparing a woman 's hair to " scouring pots and pans " and about her " stench			0
" in fact , @entity39 's clients lost in the first trial because the judge ruled that such comments and " jokes " were commonplace in @entity1 and that @entity13 should n't be singled out to pay for it			1
but the rights organization persisted , given the outrage over the song			0
some black children did not go to school because others were bullying them by singing the song , @entity39 said			0
" bullying combined with racism is a very difficult thing , a very sad and awful thing , " he said			0
an appeals court later ruled against @entity13 by a vote of 2 - 1 , with the dissenting judge using the same argument as the judge in the first trial			2
the case was appealed to @entity1 's highest court , but it declined to take the case , so the appeal court ruling stands			2
but the case was far from over and dragged on for years as both sides went back to the lower courts to fight about how big the fine should be			0
@entity13 had paid a smaller fine , but an appeals court last month upheld a ruling that the actual amount to be paid was much larger , closer to the 1.3 million reais			1
" this case is a real step forward for @entity1 , and @entity1 is changing , " said @entity104 , a sociology professor at the @entity105 at @entity106			1
@entity1 see themselves as a tolerant society -- interracial marriage was never illegal , other forms of state - sanctioned racism were never implemented , and there were no groups like the @entity115 -- but the truth is not as tidy			1
the particular form of racism found in @entity28 's song has been tolerated for a long time in songs and jokes , said @entity104 , who has written a book about race in @entity1			1
" for the first time , the court is saying , yes , this is common , but it is no longer acceptable , " she said			0
" they are acknowledging that this is harmful to people			0

a judge recently upheld a fine against @entity13 for a racist song
@entity1 see themselves as tolerant , but racism persists
@entity13 says it removed the offending song right away
the case is a step forward for @entity1 , an *expert* says
