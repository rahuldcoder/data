-- as negotiations with @entity2 are about to resume in @entity3 , some of president @entity6 's friends , not to mention his enemies , are appalled by the very idea of what they consider a deal with the devil			1
one congressman called november 's interim agreement a betrayal " worse than @entity15 " before he had even seen it			1
incapable of joining forces on anything else , some @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity2 hardliners refuse to give peace a chance			1
a century and a half ago , a recalcitrant alliance of the same improbable ilk caused literally fatal consequences			2
on february 5 , 1865 , @entity28 designed a simple compromise to end the @entity30			1
it would have saved thousands of lives , abolished slavery and enticed the departed states to disarm and return voluntarily in exchange for fair concessions			1
it never made it out of the @entity39			2
the purists in his cabinet rejected it , and the moderates would not cross them			2
a few days earlier , @entity28 and his secretary of state , @entity45 , a liberal former senator and a defeated candidate for president , had welcomed a rebel peace delegation to the presidential steamboat @entity50 , the @entity51 of her day the very news that they were talking produced howls of pain in both camps , inflamed as they were by the loss of 600,000 dead			1
in much of the @entity61 press , negotiation itself was attacked as a @entity63 trick			2
on @entity65 in @entity66 , @entity18 bright with rage denounced any deal with slave - drivers			2
" break up this nest of vipers , " an @entity70 senator said			2
@entity74 men do not haggle with snakes			0
as the @entity77 soon declared , there was " no immediate danger of peace			1
" @entity28 and @entity45 and the three @entity61 envoys , friends in " the old concern , " reminisced on the @entity50 over refreshments and cigars			1
fragrant smoke filled the air , tinged with the scent of nostalgia			0
better times were recalled , to the ring of familiar laughter			0
then the laughter came to an end			0
@entity28 demanded peace and wielded the sanctions of war			1
the rebels must drop their arms before he would come to the table			0
once they embraced reunion , accommodations might be made , including compensation for abandoning slavery , which @entity104 traders had conceived and @entity104 lawmakers had condoned , but the power of the purse was not his , and he would not negotiate with armed antagonists			0
the president was offering them nothing , one of the @entity61 said			0
for the war to end peacefully , the rebels must be " treated with , " as @entity115 had done in the @entity116			1
@entity28 's reply moved the parties no closer to the middle			1
" upon questions of history i must refer you to @entity45 , for he is posted in such things , and i do n't pretend to be bright			0
my only distinct recollection of the case is that @entity115 lost his head			0
" another southerner said an agreement would be more durable than a solution imposed by war			2
@entity28 and @entity45 were unmoved			1
they would have no conversation with armed interlocutors			0
on the long trip back to @entity66 , @entity28 thought hard on what the @entity61 had said			1
then he worked on something he could give and assembled his cabinet that night			0
for reasons lost to history , @entity45 was not there			0
@entity28 read aloud a draft proclamation asking @entity142 to endorse a compromise			1
if the seceded states returned and ratified a constitutional amendment banning slavery , the government would pay them $ 400 million for their slaves , restore their forfeited property and pardon their " political offenses			2
" as the president read his draft , secretary of the interior @entity153 was thinking , he later recalled , of a @entity28 loyalist who had just been heard to say that @entity45 should be jailed for suborning the sin of compromise			1
if @entity28 brought his plan to @entity142 , his own supporters would turn on him			1
@entity153 thought he would pay the price if a single member of his cabinet supported him			2
not a single member did			0
the discussion did n't last 10 minutes			0
with a sadness familiar to @entity153 , @entity28 " brought a long sigh " and folded up his plan			1
" you are all against me , " he said			0
@entity142 was never told that the subject had even been raised			0
in the dozen weeks that followed , before @entity170 and @entity171 surrendered their armies in april , thousands of young @entity168 died and thousands more were maimed			2
the @entity174 was subdued by the sword and subjected to military rule			0
a century of bitterness followed			0
militants were at ease in @entity181 and @entity66 alike			0
as late as 1957 , a @entity61 historian applauded the @entity142 for going down with flags flying , " without having begged for mercy , " despising the few " whipped senators " who had tried to bargain for peace when the @entity174 could no longer wage war			1
short - sighted militants are no less intransigent today			0
the many differences between the failed negotiations to end the @entity30 in 1865 and the potentially fatal outcry over the negotiations to avoid a war with @entity2 in 2014 do not obscure the similarities			1
what one @entity61 participant in the @entity197 described as " a superstitious dread " of negotiation itself was permitted to prevail in 1865 , with historically tragic results			0
at the bargaining table in @entity3 , the @entity6 administration is taking a longer view			1
a century and a half from now , posterity will thank them for it			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			1

@entity210 : @entity28 's peace efforts worth recalling as @entity6 tries negotiating with @entity2
he says hardliners on both sides of the war *scuttled* @entity28 's peace plan
@entity210 says the @entity30 could have ended *months* earlier , saving thousands of lives
he says taking risks for peace can pay off in the long run
