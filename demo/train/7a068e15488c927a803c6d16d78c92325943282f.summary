-- why are some people amazingly successful -- and other people with the same intelligence or abilities just part of the crowd ? @entity7 tries to find out why some people are successful in his new book , " outliers			1
" @entity7 , the @entity11 writer who 's made a living dissecting questions such as how small trends become major movements ( " @entity19 " ) and the value of snap judgments ( " @entity18 " ) , was curious about that subject , and -- typically -- set out to find some answers			1
the result is his new book " outliers " ( @entity24 ) , which finds parallels between the @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity29 hockey players -- as well as reasons why planes operated by members of particular cultures have a greater likelihood of crashing			1
@entity36 of @entity0 's " @entity37 " spoke to @entity7 on friday			1
the following is an edited version of that interview			0
@entity0 : we always think that it 's the smartest people that become the most successful			1
you postulate in this new book [ that ] it 's not always intelligence that leads to success			1
you say " it 's not the brightest who succeed , it 's rather a gift			2
outliers are those given opportunities who have the strength and presence of mind to seize them			2
" but there are also some commonalities with these outliers			2
i 'm really interested in things like the effects of generation			0
so what does it mean ? i have a chapter that looks at some of the most powerful people in @entity71			2
and almost all of them are born in 1955 : @entity74 at @entity75 , @entity27 at @entity76 , @entity77 -- who is one of those famous programmers -- a bunch of guys at @entity81			0
the argument there is that they were 21 when the computer revolution hit , and that 's how old you want to be when you 're confronted with a new revolution			2
that 's the kind of pattern that you see , over and over again , when you look at the lives of very successful people			1
that it 's not just their own abilities , it 's being in the right place at the right time , it 's coming from a certain kind of culture , it 's having certain built - in advantages			1
@entity0 : there were also some happy accidents along the way			0
for example , if @entity27 had n't been put into a private school , which actually had a computer -- one of the first schools to ever have a computer -- perhaps he may not have become the mogul that he was			2
@entity7 : yes , he has this incredible childhood			1
... i talked to him , and he was going through the extraordinary one - in - a - million lucky breaks that characterized his childhood			0
he got to start programming on a computer in 1968 as a 13 - year - old when nobody was programming			0
so he was way ahead of the crowd by the time he starts @entity76			0
@entity0 : you and i both lived in @entity29 , developed a love for @entity29 hockey , and you found by looking at @entity29 hockey teams that there 's a certain commonality between all of the best players , at least in the junior hockey league system , which i imagine translates to the pros as well			2
@entity7 : oh , absolutely			1
an extraordinary number of hockey players who are professionals are born in january , february and march			0
and that 's because the cutoff date for age - class hockey is january 1st			2
so when they go to ... recruit kids for all - star teams when they 're 8 or 9 years old , they think they 're choosing the most talented ones , but actually they 're choosing the biggest ones			0
because if you 're born in january and you 're 8 , you 're a lot taller , more mature and taller and bigger and stronger than someone born in december			0
@entity0 : because development is much faster there -- @entity7 : at that age , and so that advantage you get as an 8 - year - old , you get plucked out and given proper coaching and more games and more practice -- and by the time you 're 18 , you actually are better			1
@entity0 : another fascinating finding is that you are more likely to be in a plane crash if the pilot comes from a particular country			0
what 's that all about ? @entity7 : yes			1
that 's a fascinating thing			0
the single most important variable in determining whether a plane crashes is not the plane , it 's not the maintenance , it 's not the weather , it 's the culture the pilot comes from			1
planes are flown safely when the pilot and co-pilot are in open and honest communication			0
and in cultures where it is difficult for a junior person to speak openly to a superior , you have lots of plane crashes			0
@entity0 : and you said the @entity180 crash here in [ @entity11 's ] @entity181 ... is a very clear example of that			0
@entity7 : where the co-pilot was so intimidated by air traffic control , he could not tell them they were running out of fuel , and they crashed			1
they just go around and crashed			0
@entity0 : some of the ideas of this book were criticized by @entity193 , which said the book " is glib , poorly reasoned , thoroughly unconvincing			0
much of what mr. @entity7 has to say about superstars is little more than common sense : that talent alone is not enough to assure success , that opportunity , hard work , timing and luck play important roles as well			1
" what do you say about that ? @entity7 : i do n't think -- i start from a very common - sense premise , but it takes you in all kinds of interesting areas			1
i would n't say that you know the stuff about pilots , the stuff about hockey players being born in january , it does n't sound like common sense to me			0
so you know , i think what 's interesting about this book is i take a series of ideas which we all know , and then i say , look , it 's more complicated and more interesting and more fascinating than we would have ever imagined			1
@entity0 : anything we can do to try to employ some of these techniques ? @entity7 : well , the end of the book talks about what we should be doing as a country			1
it 's less about what we can do			0
when we understand that success is so much a part of the world of which we 're a part , we move away from this idea that 's about self - help and we move towards this idea that it 's time for us to be providing opportunities to a group .			2

@entity7 's new book , " outliers , " studies reasons for success
successful people are n't just smart ; they *'ve* had timing , *contacts* in their favor
book also *touches* on role of culture in creating ( or blocking ) success
