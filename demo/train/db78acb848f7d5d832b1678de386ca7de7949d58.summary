@entity0 -- is the clock ticking on gun control ? while support for many gun control policies remains high in the wake of the horrific shootings at @entity9 in @entity10 , polls conducted over the past few weeks suggest that three - and - a - half months after the tragedy , public backing for major new gun laws overall appears to have dropped significantly			1
a @entity15 survey released earlier this week indicated a 10 - point drop in the public backing of stricter gun laws , from 57 % immediately after the shootings in @entity20 , @entity10 , in december when a heavily armed gunman killed 20 young students and six adults , to 47 % now			1
that poll was in line with a @entity1 / @entity27 survey released last week that indicated a nine - point drop in the percentage of @entity30 who favor major restrictions on guns or an outright ban on gun ownership , from 52 % following the shootings to 43 %			1
opinion : did we learn nothing from @entity20 ? other polls have shown changes within their sampling error but in the same downward direction			2
an @entity46 / @entity45 poll released in mid-march showed support for stricter gun laws moving from 54 % to 52 %			2
that two - point margin was within the survey 's sampling error			0
and a @entity53 poll released last week indicated majority backing -- but some slippage -- in support for specific proposals like banning assault rifles and semi-automatic weapons and high - capacity ammunition clips			0
" opinion on gun control was fairly steady over the past few years , but seemed to spike after the @entity10 shootings , " @entity1 polling director @entity61 said			0
" the big question is whether support for major new gun laws has simply dropped back down to that previous level or whether the slide will continue even further			2
" so what 's causing the drop in support ? the surveys , including @entity1 's , offer clues			0
despite emotions , little happens legislatively after mass shootings " support for stricter gun control has fallen dramatically among two groups -- older @entity30 and people who live in rural areas , " @entity61 said			1
" in the immediate aftermath of the shootings in @entity10 , the number of rural @entity30 who supported major gun restrictions rose to 49 % but now that support has dropped 22 points			1
support for stricter gun laws dropped 16 points among @entity30 over 50 years old in that same time			1
" the new polls suggest that federal lawmakers pushing for gun control might have waited too long to act			0
senate majority leader @entity94 announced late last week that he would move ahead on a bill that would expand background checks for gun sales and stiffen gun trafficking penalties when the @entity99 returns from the two - week recess it 's currently taking			0
while national polling indicates extremely strong support for background checks , @entity94 's bill could face a very tough go of it in @entity107 - controlled @entity99 , let alone the @entity109 - dominated @entity108 .			0

public support for new gun measures has fallen dramatically since @entity20 *massacre*
support spiked after elementary *school* shootings but has dropped by *double* *digits* since
largest drop in support was among older @entity30 and those who live in rural areas
