some @entity1 users are complaining that a burst of purple is showing up in their photos -- and @entity5 seems to be acknowledging it 's just part of how the camera works			1

" i 've taken 20,000 + photos on my @entity30 , never once had this problem			2
" that user then posted two photos that appear to show the flare			2
an e-mail from @entity5 appears to confirm that the purple haze is n't all in users ' minds			1
@entity41 blog @entity39 quoted an e-mail from @entity5 support to a reader			0
he claims @entity5 support staff first said the discoloration should n't be happening but shifted after talking to @entity5 engineers			0
" our engineering team just gave me this information and we recommend that you angle the camera away from the bright light source when taking pictures , " read the e-mail , as reported by @entity39			0

the @entity1 has been @entity5 's biggest launch to date , selling 2 million units in the first 24 hours and 5 million over its first weekend on the market			1

foremost have been problems with @entity5 's new maps feature , which for the first time replaced @entity101 as the default mapping software on @entity5 's mobile operating system			2
the problems -- landmarks misplaced or misnamed , huge swaths of major cities missing -- prompted @entity5 ceo @entity108 to offer a rare apology , promising that it will be fixed and going so far as to suggest other apps in the meantime			0
other @entity1 complaints have ranged from its aluminum casing scratching easily to light leaking from openings on the phone			2
