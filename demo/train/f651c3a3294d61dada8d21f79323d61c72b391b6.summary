@entity0 -- when you see people at the office using such internet sites as @entity7 and @entity8 , you might suspect those workers are slacking off			0
a social - networking site for the world of spying officially launches for the @entity13 intelligence community this month			1
but that 's not the case at the @entity16 , the @entity17 and the @entity18 , where bosses are encouraging their staff members to use a new social - networking site designed for the super-secret world of spying			1
" it 's every bit @entity7 and @entity28 for spies , but it 's much , much more , " said @entity24 , assistant deputy director of national intelligence for analysis			1
the program is called @entity31 , and it 's a social - networking site for analysts within the 16 @entity13 intelligence agencies			1
instead of posting thoughts about the new @entity37 album or @entity39 movie , @entity16 analysts could use @entity31 to share information and opinion about @entity43 movements in the @entity44 or @entity46 naval maneuvers in the @entity47			1
the new @entity31 site has been undergoing testing for months and launches officially for the nation 's entire intelligence community september 22			1
" it 's a place where not only spies can meet but share data they 've never been able to share before , " @entity24 said			1
" this is going to give them for the first time a chance to think out loud , think in public amongst their peers , under the protection of an @entity31 umbrella			2
" @entity24 demonstrated the program to @entity1 to show how analysts will use it to collaborate			2
" one perfect example is if @entity69 comes out with a new video			0
how is that video obtained ? where are the very sensitive secret sources we may have to put into a context that 's not apparent to the rest of the world ? " @entity24 asked			0
" in the past , whoever captured that video or captured information about the video kept it in - house			2
it 's highly classified , because it has so very short a shelf life			0
that information is considered critical to our understanding			0
" the goal of @entity31 , like intelligence analysis in general , is to protect the @entity13 by assessing all the information available to the spy agencies			1
missing crucial data can have enormous implications , such as an @entity17 agent who sent an e-mail before september 11 , 2001 , warning of people learning to fly airplanes but not learning to land them			0
" there was the question , ' was that a dot that failed to connect ? ' well , that person did this via e-mail , " @entity24 said			0
" a-space is the kind of place where you can log that observation and know that your fellow analysts can see that			0
" even though @entity7 , @entity8 and other social - networking sites that inspired @entity31 are predominantly the domain of young people , there apparently is no such generational divide on @entity31			1
" we have found that participation in @entity31 crosses every conceivable age line and experience line			2
people are excited , no matter what age group , " @entity24 said			0
of course , the material on @entity31 is highly classified , so it wo n't be available for the public			2
only intelligence personnel with the proper security clearance , and a reason to be examining particular information , can access the site			1
the creators of @entity31 do not want it to be used by some future double agent such as @entity131 or @entity132 to steal @entity13 's 21st - century secrets			1
" we 're building [ a ] mechanism to alert that behavior			0
we call that , for lack of a better term , the @entity138 , where someone is using their credit card in a way they 've never used it before , and it alerts so that maybe that credit card has been stolen , " @entity24 said			0
we 're going to actually do patterns on the way people use @entity31			2
" yes , analysts can collect friends on @entity31 the way people can on @entity7			1
but nobody outside the intelligence community will ever know -- because they 're secret			0
@entity1 's @entity155 and @entity156 contributed to this report .			0
