while the issue of president @entity3 's birth has long been settled , and it 's a moot point anyway since he 's in his second term in office , there remain some people who wo n't be convinced			1
just ask members of @entity8 , who even this summer are encountering so - called " birthers " at town hall meetings			0
with @entity12 , there is no conspiracy			2
he was n't born in the @entity14			1
but that has n't stopped the junior @entity17 senator from courting a possible presidential bid			0
the dynamic young senator has traveled to @entity20 and other early primary states			0
if his moves toward a candidacy become more serious , they 're sure to spark first a debate about his conservative politics , but also that recurring debate about whether a " natural - born citizen " can be born outside the @entity14			1
birther - in - chief @entity30 , who appeared to be running singularly on that issue in 2011 , was more restrained when he was asked if @entity33 - born @entity12 was eligible to be president			1
" perhaps not , " @entity30 told @entity35 on sunday			2
" i do n't know the circumstances			0
i heard somebody told me he was born in @entity33			2
that 's really his thing , " said @entity30 , who could face @entity12 in a @entity39 primary if both men follow through with runs they appear to be teasing			1
another @entity12 trip to @entity20 raises 2016 speculation @entity12 seems to think the facts are on his side			2
" my mother was born in @entity49 , @entity50			2
she 's a @entity14 citizen , so i 'm a @entity14 citizen , " @entity12 told @entity35 in july			1
" i 'm not going to engage in a legal debate			0
the facts are clear , " he added			0
" i can tell you where i was born and who my parents were			0
and then as a legal matter , others can worry about that			0
i 'm not going to engage			0
" time : @entity12 talks about @entity3 , spats with fellow republicans there is precedent for people born outside the @entity14 making credible runs for the presidency			1
@entity66 , @entity67 's father , was born in @entity68 to mormon missionaries			2
he ran for president in 1968			0
for all the ink spilled about @entity3 's provenance -- @entity73 , people -- it was actually @entity75 in the 2008 presidential contest who was born outside the @entity14			1
@entity75 's father , an admiral , was stationed in the @entity79			2
democrats did n't make an issue of @entity75 's birthright to run , however			0
in fact , @entity84 candidates @entity3 and then - sen. @entity85 sponsored a non-binding resolution in the spring of 2008 declaring that @entity75 was a natural - born citizen			1
this is all the @entity89 has to say about the qualifications to be president : " no person except a natural born citizen , or a @entity94 , at the time of the adoption of this @entity89 , shall be eligible to the office of president ; neither shall any person be eligible to that office who shall not have attained to the age of thirty five years , and been fourteen years a @entity102 within the @entity14			1
" that 's pretty clear			0
only a 35 - year - old ( or older ) " natural - born citizen " can be president			1
but it turns out not be that clear			0
who is a " natural - born citizen ? " citizen scholarship falls on the side of @entity75			1
he had two @entity14 citizen parents and one was working for the @entity14 government when he was born in @entity79			1
@entity12 does n't check all those boxes			2
his father , a preacher who has delivered stem - winding speeches of his own , has since become an @entity14			1
but at the time of @entity12 's birth in @entity33 , he was a @entity119 émigré working for an oil company			1
his mother , however , hails from @entity50			0
@entity12 's father makes fiery @entity124 speech there is a 50 - page report prepared for lawmakers by the @entity128			1
you can read the whole thing here			0
the key paragraph in that lawerly paper reads this way : " the weight of legal and historical authority indicates that the term " natural born " citizen would mean a person who is entitled to @entity14 citizenship " by birth " or " at birth , " either by being born " in " the @entity14 and under its jurisdiction , even those born to alien parents ; by being born abroad to @entity14 citizen - parents ; or by being born in other situations meeting legal requirements for @entity14 citizenship " at birth			1
" it does not specifically deal with the issue of someone born outside the @entity14 to one @entity14 parent			2
but if @entity12 could claim citizenship at birth , according to the argument , he could claim to be natural born			1
the natural - born citizen requirement was put into the @entity89 , according to the congressional report , to ward against aristocracy coming to @entity14 and setting up a new kingdom			1
there has been discussion of doing away with the requirement altogether			0
sen. @entity165 , @entity166 introduced the @entity167 to @entity168 in july 2003			0
it would allow immigrants who had been naturalized for at least 20 years to run for president			0
but it has gone exactly nowhere			0
opinion : @entity12 can be president , probably			0

possible 2016 presidential candidate @entity12 's birth circumstances raise **eligibility** ***question**s*
@entity12 was born in @entity33 to @entity14 citizen mother and @entity119 father
birther - in - chief @entity30 raised **question** of @entity12 's **eligibility** in *weekend* *appearance*
