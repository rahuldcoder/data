as the county sheriff @entity49 blocked the group , @entity0 said in his fiery tone , " we will register to vote because as citizens of the @entity53 we have the right to do it			1
" this did not sit well with @entity49 , who instead of keeping the peace , disrupted it by beating @entity0 until blood dripped off his chin in plain view of rolling cameras			1
