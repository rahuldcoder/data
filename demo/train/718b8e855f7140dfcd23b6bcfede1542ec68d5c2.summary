-- nine of the 10 countries with the world 's highest rates of child marriage are in @entity6 : @entity7 , @entity8 and @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 , @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , and @entity15			1
my country , @entity18 , did not make the list			2
but in traditional @entity22 communities like mine , marrying off girls is very common			1
i was married at 13 to a man in his 70s			2
it happened during @entity28 break			2
my father told my school that i had died			2
even if he had n't , i would have been forced to leave when i got pregnant because that was the law at the time			2
i gave birth to my first child within a year			1
i had no professional prenatal care and no trained medical assistance during delivery			2
i had to depend on my husband and his other wives for guidance			2
it was a very painful experience			2
every time i became pregnant after that i felt sick and scared			2
because of all these difficult births i have a hard time controlling my bladder and it can be painful to urinate			2
today , i am a mother of five at 29 years old			0
@entity48 : whose words inspire you ? in communities like mine , age is not understood as a number			1
our traditional values dictate girls are meant for marriage , and when the men decide we are biologically ready , we are married			1
marriage is sometimes a way of forming and cementing relationships			1
but it is also a way of earning money			0
my family received a bride price from my husband and then he took me away to become one of his wives			1
he beat me regularly , and so i fled back to my village			0
but my father and brother told me the price had been paid , this was no longer my home , i had to return			0
it was n't until six years ago that i was able to take charge of my own destiny			0
i ran away to the city of @entity82 and met @entity83 , a volunteer with the @entity84 ( @entity84 )			0
through counseling , workshops and friendship , i gained more confidence in my own voice and learned to support myself			0
when i returned to my village , i found an ally : one of our community leaders , named @entity93			0
in his own extended family girls were running away from forced marriages			1
he felt obliged to support them by giving them shelter and food			0
quietly , he was encouraging them to go to school hoping it would be a way to get girls out of their situation			1
when he learned about how i was able to find support from @entity84 he was inspired			0
knowing there would be places for girls to go outside their communities helped convince him they would be ok if they left their marriages			1
but i love my family and my community , and i did n't want leaving to be the answer			0
so i set up a @entity84 in my village and slowly , change is happening			0
some men and boys are not happy with what i 'm doing			0
i have to be around others all the time to protect myself from harassment			0
i do n't know if my own father would approve if he were still alive			0
but many are recognizing that this is the way forward -- that girls have value beyond marriage			1
that we can earn money and contribute more to our communities when we stay in school			1
read also : school ' pays dowry ' to save girls from marriage my brother used to think i was wrong to leave my husband			1
but seeing how well i am doing selling traditional @entity22 jewelry and clothing he is starting to respect my choice			1
he no longer beats me , but he still wo n't let me have access to any of my father 's farms			1
thankfully , i have supporters in my community who help give me other options to grow food for my children			0
i believe my relationship with my brother will get better with time			0
i am still working on it			0
my mother is so proud			0
she used to fear my disobedience to my husband would reflect poorly on her and she would be cast out of the community			0
but now she sees i am welcome and respected and she is so happy to have me back in her life			0
when attitudes begin to shift from within communities this way , then people start to have hope			1
and politicians gain more courage to act			0
without support from community leaders , parliamentarians fear passing laws will cost them votes and they will lose power to make any difference at all			0
likewise , passing laws provides no guarantee girls will be protected unless they have community support : 158 countries have set the legal age for marriage at 18 years but the laws are simply ignored by communities where marrying children and adolescent girls is common practice			1
in the fight against child marriage , the biggest battle is finding those who are ready for change and giving them the courage to speak to others			1
those of us who believe in the power of girls , who have seen what they can do when they have options , we need to tell everyone we can			1
we need to teach girls that it 's ok to say no to marrying before they are ready , and that there are places they can go if they have to run away			1
we need to talk to families about different ways their girls can contribute to their livelihoods , so that marriage is not seen as the only option			1
we need to show community leaders examples of girls who have stayed in school , learned skills , and have helped develop their local economies			1
we need to convince politicians that they should pass laws to protect and empower girls , and that the people will support them if they do			2
and we need to share our success stories with the world			2
because people need to know we are fighting for change and they can join us in their own countries and communities			1
change is possible when we believe in each other			0
