-- a 37 - year - old man arrested wednesday in @entity2 as part of an investigation of ricin - laced letters threatened in one such letter to injure and kill a federal judge , a grand jury indictment alleges			1
@entity12 agents arrested @entity13 on wednesday afternoon , and he made his initial court appearance in @entity15 later in the day , the federal agency 's @entity2 state office said in a news release			1
@entity13 remained in custody after the appearance , and he 'll stay behind bars at least until a bail hearing takes place next tuesday afternoon , @entity12 spokeswoman @entity17 said			1
a grand jury charged @entity13 with mailing threatening communication , claiming he " knowingly and willfully " mailed through the @entity25 a letter " containing a threat to injure and kill @entity29 ( @entity31 ) @entity30 , " according to the indictment			1
@entity30 is a senior judge in the @entity32 for the @entity33 of @entity2			2
in a subsequent news release , the @entity12 said tests -- conducted by that agency and the @entity37 -- showed that a suspicious substance found with the letter was " active ricin toxin			1
" " our coordinated team acted swiftly to resolve a potentially dangerous situation , and continues working tirelessly around the clock to investigate the origin of the letters and to address any remaining , potential risks , " said @entity41 , the @entity12 's special - agent - in - charge at the bureau 's @entity44 office			2
the @entity52 has been trying to find the source of the two letters containing ricin since they were intercepted in a screening procedure at a postal facility in @entity15 , the @entity12 said last week			2
the @entity58 earlier did say a ricin - laced letter was sent to a judge in @entity15 , the northeastern @entity2 city in which @entity30 works			1
another letter reportedly containing the toxin was directed to the @entity64 , the union said			0
both letters were postmarked may 14			0
@entity67 told employees they were n't at risk from handling the letters because the suspected substance was not in a form that could be inhaled or readily ingested , the union said			0
that said , preliminary lab tests did indicate it was indeed ricin			0
if inhaled , injected or ingested , less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours because of the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems			0
there is no known antidote for the toxin , which is derived from castor beans			0
