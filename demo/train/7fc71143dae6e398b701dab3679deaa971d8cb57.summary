-- @entity2 's @entity1 claimed his ninth victory of an all - conquering season in @entity5 but must wait to clinch the formula one world title for the second straight year			1
the @entity7 took the checkered flag in the night race ahead of @entity10 of @entity11 with @entity12 , @entity1 's teammate , in third place			1
the 24 - year - old @entity1 has a massive 124 - point lead over @entity15 's @entity10 , whose fourth straight podium denied him the chance to wrap up the championship crown			1
he will surely achieve the feat at the @entity21 @entity20 on october 9 , where he needs just a single point , after another commanding display on @entity26 's marina bay street circuit			1
it was his 19th career victory			2
@entity29 's @entity28 came home fourth and is third in the standings , one point adrift of @entity10 , while @entity33 took fifth after a drive through penalty in his @entity15 and no less than five pits stops			2
another @entity37 , @entity38 , was an excellent sixth for @entity40 , his best result to date in his rookie season in @entity43 , ahead of @entity7 @entity44 in seventh for @entity46 and @entity47 in the second @entity40			0
@entity48 of @entity29 , who collided with @entity33 in the early stages , finished ninth with @entity52 @entity51 in the final points scoring position in 10th			0
@entity51 had a coming together with seven - time champion @entity55 , which eliminated the @entity7 in his @entity46			0
but once again it was @entity1 who hogged all the headlines and he is set to become the youngest - ever double champion			0
" i was in control at the end and it is a great feeling to win this race -- i love the track here and it 's such a challenge , " he told the post-race press conference			0
" as to the championship ? ah , well , i guess i have another chance at the next race			0
" it 's not over until it 's over , " he added , but 2009 champion @entity10 would have to win all the remaining five rounds with @entity1 failing to score a single point .			1

@entity1 wins @entity76 to extend @entity43 championship lead
@entity10 finishes second with @entity1 's @entity2 teammate @entity12 in third
@entity1 needs a single point in the next race in @entity21 to clinch a second straight @entity43 crown
ninth win of the season for all - conquering @entity1 in his @entity2 and 19th career
