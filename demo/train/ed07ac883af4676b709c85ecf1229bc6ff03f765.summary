-- an 18 - year - old @entity2 fisherman who survived 28 days adrift at sea is suing @entity4 , arguing that one of its cruise ships should have stopped and saved him			1
a negligence lawsuit filed in @entity9 last week says the behavior of officers or crew members of the @entity13 was " outrageous and , under the circumstances , so beyond all bounds of decency as to be regarded as shocking , atrocious and utterly intolerable in a civilized community			1
" three passengers who were birdwatching on the ship alerted a crew member when they spotted @entity22 and his companions signaling for help from their fishing boat , the suit says			1
even though crew members " had clear knowledge that people were stranded in an open boat hundreds of miles from shore in the @entity33 and desperately calling for their help , " the suit says , " they consciously ignored the emergency situation and did not deviate from their cruise			1
" the fishing boat , @entity38 , had been adrift for 15 days when it crossed paths with the @entity13 on march 10 , according to the lawsuit			0
at the time , all three fishermen aboard were alive			0
later that day , according to the lawsuit , 16 - year - old @entity42 died , " having lost all hope as the @entity13 steamed away			0
" five days later , another fisherman on the broken - down boat , @entity46 , 24 , died at sea			1
two days after spotting the struggling fishermen , the three cruise ship passengers followed up with a ship officer , asking him what happened to the fishing boat after their report , according to the lawsuit			1
" this officer did not have an answer for them and walked away without explanation , " the lawsuit says			0
@entity4 spokeswoman @entity59 did not comment on this specific allegation monday , adding that the company was still investigating the incident			1
@entity63 , a lawyer for @entity22 , speculated that one reason the @entity13 did not stop was because the cruise ship 's crew did n't want to get off schedule for their next stop in @entity70 , @entity71 -- and , thus , lose money			1
the ship did arrive in @entity70 on march 11 , noted candy , but she strongly denied that the crew decided not to help the fishermen for financial reasons			1
" this is absolutely false , " she told @entity0 by e-mail			0
@entity4 released a statement monday saying it was " deeply saddened that two @entity2 men perished at sea " and " very sorry for the tragic loss of life			1
" " because of what we suspect was a case of unfortunate miscommunication , regretfully the captain of the @entity13 was never notified of the passengers ' concern			1
had he been advised , he would have had the opportunity to respond , as he has done numerous times throughout his career , " the statement said			0
" this is an upsetting and emotional issue for us all , as no employee onboard a @entity13 ship would purposefully ignore someone in distress			0
it is our ethical and maritime responsibility to provide assistance to any vessel in need , and it is not an uncommon occurrence for our ships to be involved in a rescue at sea			2
in fact , we have done so more than 30 times over the last decade			0
" @entity113 , one of the cruise ship passengers who said he saw the stranded fisherman and alerted the cruise ship 's crew , told @entity0 last month that he took a picture of the fishing boat from about two miles away			1
" it 's just a horrible thing			2
i 'm sick about it , " he said			0
he saw the tiny vessel through high - powered scopes , he said			0
it appeared not to be moving , he said , but the men onboard were			0
" we were looking through powerful spotting scopes before i took those photographs , and we -- the three of us -- could n't come up with any reasonable explanation why somebody would have been flagging with two different colors of cloth , clothing or whatever it was , to our ship from perhaps two miles away on a little boat that was n't moving , over 100 miles from the coast , " he said			2
at the time , he and his fellow passengers thought the cruise ship crew members would do something			1
" we fully expected the ship to turn around or to send a tender boat out to investigate ... our suspicions , " he said			0
@entity22 's lawsuit seeks compensation for physical , emotional and psychological injuries that it alleges he suffered as a result of the conduct of cruise line employees			1
the story of @entity22 's survival gained international coverage when the @entity158 navy rescued him north of the @entity159 in march			2
the trio 's february 24 fishing trip had started out well , according to @entity22 's mother , @entity162			2
the three caught plenty of fish , she said			0
but the boat 's engine died without warning and , with no tools and scant navigational experience , there was little the trio could do , @entity166 told @entity0			2
@entity158 rear adm. @entity174 said that at the time he was found , the 18 - year - old showed " severe signs of dehydration and lack of nutrition			0
" he said the survivor had thrown his friends ' bodies into the ocean " because they had become badly decomposed			2
" @entity0 's @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 and @entity188 contributed to this report .			0
