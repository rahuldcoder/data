@entity0 , @entity1 -- growing up , my @entity5 tank - like aunt constantly blamed her thyroid for inability to lose weight			1
the thyroid is a butterfly - shaped gland at the base of the neck			1
most of her seven sisters , behind her back , blamed something else , like her eating an entire cake by herself at their weekly coffee klatch			2
but who knows ? that was 15 years ago and our awareness of thyroid and its many problems has grown			1
she just might have been right pointing her finger at her thyroid , because , according to the @entity30 , as many as 27 million @entity31 suffer from some type of thyroid gland misfiring			1
and half of these folks do n't even know what they are missing			1
for while this little , butterfly - shaped gland at the base of our neck , weighing in at barely an ounce , seems both delicate and innocuous , when not in hormonally balanced harmony , it packs a wallop			1
the truth is , it 's more like the @entity47 of our body 's hormone factories ; it floats and appears like a butterfly but stings like a bee			2
" our thyroid , even though it 's a small gland in your neck , controls everything , " says endocrinologist @entity53			1
" it can control your thought patterns , your mood , your heart rate , blood pressure , digestive system , menstrual system , skin and bones			2
" that 's a lot of controlling going on , but more than controlling , this little gland 's job is all about regulating			1
the thyroid gland is in charge of making two very important hormones , respectively known as @entity73 and @entity74			1
and it 's when the levels go awry that we start to have problems			2
for most people suffering from thyroid dysfunction , and these problems affect more women than men , their problem is that not enough hormones are being made			1
this is called hypothyroidism , and the symptoms are somewhat elusive			1
that is probably why doctors such as @entity53 use a handy tool to help patients identify the problem			0
" there is actually an acronym that we use for hypothyroidism , " she said			1
" it 's called sluggish			0
sometimes when you feel sluggish , this might serve as a red flag and you might think , ' oh it might be my thyroid ! ' " sluggish stands for sleepiness , fatigue , tiredness loss of memory unusually dry coarse skin @entity111 ( enlarged thyroid ) gradual personality change increase in weight , bloating , puffiness sensitivity to cold hair loss , sparseness of hair and while these symptoms might be signals that something other than your thyroid is the issue , it 's worth getting it tested			1
a simple blood test will tell you if your problems are a bigger hormonal deal			0
the condition is lifelong , or as @entity53 puts it , " from the cradle to the rocking chair			0
" meaning that it can appear at just about any age , but once identified it does n't go away			1
its treatment , however , is fairly straightforward : hormone replacement therapy			0
but on the other side of the thyroid production line is the overzealous hormone maker			2
a lot less common than hypothyroidism , this is known as hyperthyroidism			1
" hyperthyroidism is when the thyroid is actually making too much thyroid hormone			1
i tell my patients , it 's like a forest fire in @entity156 , burning everything up , " explains @entity53 , who just recently found out she suffered from this issue			0
it took almost a year for her to figure it out since she had no family history to worry about , and most thyroid problems are usually genetic , even though she displayed all the classic symptoms			2
" my first symptoms were irritability , feeling tired and blue			0
my memory was poor and i had a hard time concentrating			0
weight loss , despite being constantly hungry and eating like a pig			0
long durations of sleep but never feeling rested , " @entity53 says			0
finally when her hands started trembling and her heart started racing , she sought medical help			0
a blood test revealed her levels were off the charts			0
good news for the young doctor who feared she had cancer or mercury poisoning			0
but just like hypothyroidism , this conditions is very treatable			2
@entity53 , who is doing much better now , details the options			0
" the treatment is very different from hypothyroidism ; we are actually trying to slow the function of the thyroid down			1
" there are actually three ways to treat it , " @entity53 said			0
" @entity192 was a way we used to treat it in the past			0
we do n't use that as much any more unless someone has a nodule and you think that may be a suspicious cell or cancer			2
" today 's most common treatment is anti-thyroid medications , which slow hormone production			0
radioactive iodine also is used , she said			0
" it 's a substance that when you give it , it will actually damage the thyroid to help put out the fire , so to speak , to put out the flame of the overactive gland			1
" doctors now recommend that everyone over 35 get his or her thyroid gland tested regularly			1
because there are certain risks with even mild changes in thyroid levels , those considered at high risk , including pregnant women and those with a family history of thyroid problems , need to get tested earlier and more frequently , @entity53 said			2
which leads me back to that aunt of mine			0
if she was right and it was not just an overactive hand - to - mouth cake thing , then i better call my doctor pronto to schedule my own test .			0

as many as 27 million @entity31 suffer from some type of thyroid gland misfiring
half do n't know it , endocrinologist group says
most sufferers have hypothyroidism , or *underactive* thyroid
hyperthyroidism is much more rare
