-- trees once looked like green panels for @entity3			1
he 'd have to move his head to gauge the relative closeness of objects			2
for most of his life , he had poor depth perception			2
his eyes pointed outward and did not allow him to see , in stereo , a single image with both eyes			1
but in february 2012 , something changed when he went to a movie theater with his wife			2
he put on a pair of @entity22 glasses to watch the film " @entity24 " and , to his amazement , the characters and scenery in this film jumped out at him in greater stereo vision than he had experienced before			1
what 's more , after returning the glasses and leaving the theater , @entity3 's perception of the real world was enhanced as well			1
a lamppost jumped out from the background , and the trees , cars and people looked somehow more vivid			2
this was the world with depth			2
" " suddenly , things began to jump out at me , " said @entity3 , a professor of psychology at the @entity40 , @entity41			1
the effect has stuck around since he saw the movie 16 months ago			2
it 's impossible to prove scientifically that the film itself altered his visual system , but his hope is that his story could help others with similar eye conditions who struggle through months of training to attempt to see more vividly			1
other experts say the vivid 3 - d movie could have indeed jolted @entity3 's visual system in this way , but that it would n't work as a quick fix for most people with eye alignment problems			1
it 's possible with @entity3 's unique set of circumstances , it was exactly what he needed , but it would probably help few people			1
" certainly immersion in a @entity22 movie could , if somebody had a marginal vision system , could absolutely improve it , " said @entity69 , associate professor at the @entity70 in @entity71 , who has not evaluated @entity3			1
but , he adds , " i would n't prescribe ( a movie )			0
" a flat world for @entity3 , the world used to be a much flatter place -- like a two - dimensional movie on a flat screen , he said			1
he often looked through only one eye or the other			0
he used other cues to help him figure out relative distances			0
for instance , parallax is a phenomenon in which , when you move your head , objects that are closer appear to move faster than objects that are farther away			0
objects also generally appear smaller when they are farther away			0
" you still see the world as kind of , in theory , three - dimensional , but the experience is more flat , " he said			2
" i did n't realize that until i began to see in proper stereo			0
" @entity3 recalls having his eyes examined at age 8 at a hospital in @entity104			1
doctors recommended against surgery , although he doubts his family could have afforded it anyway			0
because his eyes are n't completely well aligned , there 's a small eye movement that occurs when he shifts from looking through one eye to the other			2
" that had always been a social disadvantage , because people were never quite sure what i was looking at , " he said			0
he remembers in junior high school , his social studies teacher scolded him for giving him what the teacher thought was a disrespectful look			0
@entity3 had no idea what he was talking about and denied it , but still remembers this experience with anger and regret			1
in his early 20s , when he drove , he noticed that he could n't read signs on freeways until he had passed the exits			0
he went to a clinic where he found out he had myopia and other deviations of the eye			0
in 1983 , at the @entity134 , he collaborated with two colleagues on a study of his own vision			0
through such testing , it was obvious that his stereo vision was n't great , and that he had exotropic vision , meaning his eyes pointed in different directions			2
but he did n't know what perceptual difference it would make to view the world more in stereo , until he saw " @entity24			1
" now , objects that appeared to be on top of each other seem more separate , and 2 - @entity151 movies are recognizably flat -- before , they were perhaps " just as real as the real world , " he said			0
@entity155 it is estimated that between 3 % and 5 % of people are stereo - blind or have large deficits in stereo vision			0
@entity3 's case reminds experts of @entity155 , neurobiologist at @entity163 in @entity164 , who wrote a book called " fixing my gaze : a scientist 's journey into seeing in @entity169 " about how she gained stereo vision			1
neurologist @entity172 wrote about her as " @entity155 " in a 2006 article in the @entity175			0
@entity176 was cross-eyed from the first few months of life , and never learned how to point her eyes in the same direction , until she used a set of procedures to reposition her eyes over a period of a year			1
she believes this tapped into the circuitry in her brain specialized for binocular vision that had n't been active before			0
" people like me or like @entity3 who are cross-eyed , have strabismus , probably have the capacity to see in stereo if you can change your visual habits so as to point the two eyes at the same place at the same time , and bring in correlated input into the brain , " said @entity176 , who has corresponded with @entity3 but not studied him directly			1
several scientific studies have shown that , with training , people can recover stereo vision even if they 've never had it , said @entity205 , senior scientist at the @entity206 in @entity207			0
this is a recent shift in thinking			0
for decades , scientists believed that stereo vision could not be recovered , once lost			0
" it turns out that , in fact , with a lot of practice , like many other things you can recover capabilities , which is exciting , " @entity205 said			0
similarly , scientists once thought that there was a " critical period " of the first few years of life , during which one would either be able to see in three dimensions or not			0
@entity176 was 48 when she started to perceive three dimensions , and at first kept her awareness secret from other scientists out of concern that " they would think i 'm hysterical			0
" so what about that movie ? in his academic life , @entity3 's specialty is -- guess what ! -- the visual system			1
he 's working on such projects as eliminating sickness in driving simulators and exploring illusions such as why people overestimate the slopes of hills			0
after viewing " @entity24 , " @entity3 read up on research on the neuroscience of vision to come up with a possible explanation of what happened			1
@entity245 and @entity246 , who shared the 1981 @entity247 , had done research on kittens that gave @entity251 ideas about what could be going on in his own brain			0
the researchers studied the eyes and visual systems of young cats with misaligned eyes , showing that most cells in the brain 's visual cortex would be activated by one eye or the other			1
but a small group of these cells also responded to both eyes			2
@entity3 's hypothesis is that the analogous cells in himself got awakened during the movie , becoming newly connected to allow stereoscopic vision			1
" it was sort of serendipitous that i had spent my lifetime studying vision , and then this experience happened , so i could talk about it and maybe understand it in ways that most people would n't be able to , " he said			2
the act of watching a movie is n't going to fix someone who has an eye turned abnormally , but if someone was already at the cusp of this happening , it 's possible , @entity69 said			2
in @entity69 ' practice , patients with intermittent exotropia -- eyes that point outward much of the time -- typically go through a six - month process of training , involving exercises to help them focus both eyes together			1
@entity69 has seen patients have overpowering emotional experiences after therapy sessions , saying , " it 's the first time i 've seen the space between things			0
" it makes sense to @entity69 that a 3 - d movie could have had this effect on @entity3			1
ordinary movies do not reward the brain for bringing an outward - deviating eye in , but a @entity22 movie does			2
" the moment he brought his eye in subconsciously , he was like , ' oh wow , this looks cool , ' and then probably maintained the effort , " @entity69 said			0
the movie probably had the effect of training not the muscles of @entity3 's eyes per se , @entity69 said , but rather " the software he used in terms of how he looked at the world			1
" researchers have suggested that creating video games with three - dimensional information could be used to help children and adults with eye misalignment problems achieve improved stereo vision , @entity205 said			0
looking for more insights @entity3 's vision still is n't perfect			1
a few months after viewing " @entity24 , " he went to an optometrist in @entity41 who administered a test for stereo threshold , the same one @entity3 had taken at @entity134 in the 1980s			1
the test showed his stereo vision had improved dramatically since his earlier test , but still was n't within normal range			0
there still remain many unanswered questions			0
just how common is it for an adult to acquire stereo vision ? which specific visual anomalies might respond best to watching a @entity22 movie ? @entity3 wants to know			1
he 's in touch with @entity346 at the @entity134 , who led a study of five adults who went from being stereo - blind to seeing depth again through training			2
since a @entity353 article appeared about @entity3 last year , he 's gotten numerous e-mails from others with stereo vision problems			1
one man told him he had an experience similar to @entity3 's			1
" when it happens , it 's very sudden and pleasant , to see things in @entity22 that have been flat for all your life , " @entity3 said			1
follow @entity363 on @entity364 at @ lizlandau and on @entity366 .			0

@entity3 says he saw greater depth after watching the film " @entity24 " last year
he has a condition in which his eyes point outward
the enhanced visual experience has continued since then
