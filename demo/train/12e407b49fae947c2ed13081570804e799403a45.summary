@entity0 -- protests cropping up in more than a dozen @entity4 cities prompted president @entity5 to discuss the phenomenon thursday by saying demonstrators " are giving voice " to those frustrated " about how our financial system works			1
" speaking at a @entity12 news conference , @entity5 also defended the country 's financial sector , which appears to have taken the brunt of protester criticism , focusing on @entity17 and its regulators ' purported role in widening economic disparities			0
" we have to have a strong , effective financial sector in order for us to grow , " the president said thursday			2
still , @entity5 discussed a need to pursue action aimed at improving government oversight and blamed the financial sector and @entity29 lawmakers for obstructing reforms			1
" not only did the financial sector , with the @entity29 in @entity32 , fight us every step of the way , " but now the " same folks " are suggesting that the country should " roll back reforms " and go back to " the way it was " before the financial crisis			1
rep. @entity41 said thursday that limiting federal spending was pivotal to boosting the economy			1
the @entity44 @entity29 also urged the government to lower taxes to promote @entity4 - friendly businesses and spur economic growth			1
vice president @entity49 also weighed in , comparing the protestors to the origins of the tea party , a grass - roots political movement that has advocated reductions in government spending and efforts to curb corruption			1
" what is the core of that protest ? and why is it increasing in terms of the people it 's attracting ? " @entity49 asked rhetorically			1
" the core is the bargain has been breached with the @entity4 people			0
" he added that " there 's a lot in common with the tea party			1
" the two movements have drawn commentary from liberal and radical conservatives , who in both cases have said there is something fundamentally wrong with @entity4 's financial and political systems			0
thursday marked the 20th day of @entity82 protests , now a series of grass - roots demonstrations against income inequality , corporate greed and a list of other often loosely defined social ills			1
overheard on @entity1 : your take on the protests @entity0 authorities set up at least one vehicle checkpoint as police appeared in larger numbers throughout the financial district and established a perimeter around @entity97 , which is considered a rallying point for the largely leaderless movement in that city			2
" we hope that our message continues to resonate with everyone who has felt disenfranchised by the current state of our country , " said @entity101 , a spokesman for the @entity82 group			1
he said they plan to " continue the protest until the message reaches every house in the @entity4			0
" what that message is remains largely unclear			0
meanwhile , hundreds turned out in downtown @entity114 near @entity115 in a similar demonstration			2
crowds also gathered in the @entity119 cities of @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 , while more protests cropped up in @entity125 , @entity126 ; @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity129 , @entity130			1
like - minded university students staged walk - outs a day before on college campuses such as @entity133 and the @entity134			0
and still more demonstrations took place thursday in @entity137 , @entity138 , and @entity139 , where police say 10 people were arrested for trespassing on @entity143 property			1
in the nation 's capital , a war protest on thursday -- scheduled the day before the 10 - year anniversary of the @entity4 - led invasion of @entity149 -- quickly turned their concerns to economics			2
several hundred set to demonstrate against wars in @entity155 and @entity149 also echoed the voices of protesters in other cities , even bringing their rally to in front of the @entity161			1
a day before , thousands marched in @entity163 shouting slogans and waving placards as they meandered from @entity97 to @entity166 near @entity115			0
that event turned violent later wednesday evening , as some protesters scuffled with police , resulting in the arrest of 23 people for various offenses			2
one of them is charged with assaulting a police officer			0
video taken by various news agencies showed police officers wielding batons and forcing protesters to the ground as the officers made arrests			2
other videos emerged on @entity184 and other internet sites , showing police officers swinging batons at demonstrators			2
still , it was not clear what prompted the exchanges			0
the city 's deputy police commissioner @entity192 said five people were detained after charging a police line			0
the majority of wednesday 's protests , however , were peaceful and appeared buoyed by the support of local unions , including the @entity200 , @entity201 and the @entity202			0
the broader protest campaign -- which uses the hashtag # occupywallstreet on the microblogging site @entity206 -- began in july with the launch of a campaign website calling for a march and sit - in at the @entity211			0
while the fledgling movement since has struggled to define its mission , its participants have generally agreed in their criticism of the country 's wealthiest 1 % and their purported influence			0
the protests seemed to gain momentum after a september 24 pepper spray incident involving demonstrators and police			1
and last saturday , police arrested hundreds as they marched across a roadway leading to the @entity226 , blocking city traffic for hours			0
social media sites such as @entity206 seemed to be spurring similar protests elsewhere , though in vastly smaller numbers than those in @entity0			1
that includes dozens who gathered in @entity235 ; @entity236 , @entity237 ; and @entity238 , @entity239			0
@entity1 's @entity240 , @entity241 , @entity242 and @entity243 contributed to this report .			0
