@entity0 -- the @entity2 may have voted contempt charges against attorney general @entity4 , but that has not ended the investigation into who at the @entity7 knew about @entity9 -- and when			1
tuesday , sen. @entity10 , @entity11 , sent a letter to @entity4 demanding to know who at the @entity7 was aware of a @entity14 memo on questionable tactics , which was forwarded to @entity14 headquarters and possibly to the @entity7 one day before @entity7 sent a faulty letter to @entity10 denying any " gunwalking			2
" " which @entity7 personnel received a copy of the february 3 , 2011 memorandum before the february 4 , 2011 reply was sent to me ? " @entity10 demanded to know			2
@entity10 said information he has received , apparently from whistleblowers , indicated the memo questioning @entity9 from @entity14 field agent @entity28 had caused a stir at @entity14 headquarters			0
" it has been alleged individuals within the deputy attorney general 's office and @entity33 at the @entity7 were aware of or actually read the memorandum before the @entity7 's february 4 , 2011 letter was sent , " @entity10 said			1
@entity10 said he wants answers and any relevant documents no later than july 17 , 2012			0
the issue is significant because the february 4 letter from @entity7 denied any " gunwalking " of illegally purchased firearms that had made their way across the @entity45 border to drug cartels			0
but the @entity7 10 months later had to admit to @entity47 that letter was wrong , and it was formally withdrawn by senior justice officials			0
a senior @entity7 official familiar with the @entity10 letter when asked for reaction said only , " we will respond appropriately			1

new : " we will respond appropriately , " says a @entity7 official
sen. @entity10 's letter demands answers from attorney general *holder*
at issue is a february 2011 memo that *preceded* a @entity7 letter to @entity10
