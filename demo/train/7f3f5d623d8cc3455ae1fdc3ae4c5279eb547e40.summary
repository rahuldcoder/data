-- @entity1 this week returned to @entity2 as newly - crowned champions of the fifth @entity5 's @entity4 in @entity6			2
taking on two other @entity8 teams as well as @entity9 , the @entity6 champions , the @entity12 's runners - up last season used the competition to put the finishing touch on a summer of preparation , and to raise the club 's profile in this part of the world			1
in truth , the outcome was never seriously in doubt , despite the presence of @entity12 opponents @entity25 and @entity26			1
such is the financial muscle of a moneyed group of clubs , who include @entity1 , @entity31 , @entity32 and @entity33 , the rest of @entity36 's top flight increasingly seem to exist to make up the numbers			1
@entity33 used to be in this latter group , before a massive cash injection from billionaire @entity40 , a member of @entity42 's ruling family , catapulted @entity33 into football 's big time			1
however , the club is hemorrhaging money , as a sky - high wage bill coupled with the payment of exorbitant transfer fees exceeds what it actually earns in ticket sales , sponsorship and other commercial deals			1
but as long as their wealthy benefactor 's largesse continues and success accompanies it , neither the owners nor the fans particularly mind			2
@entity1 also has a rich owner , @entity64 oligarch @entity63 , who made headlines in 2003 by purchasing the club outright and declaring that they would immediately be a force to be reckoned with			2
the @entity2 club certainly look like contenders this season if last weekend 's performance is any indication -- no goals conceded in four matches held across three countries - but their impact off the field is most eye - catching			1
@entity1 played in front of 85,000 fans in @entity81 , while another packed stadium greeted them in @entity6 when they faced @entity25 in the @entity4 final			0
that 's tens of thousands of @entity86 - based fans buying tickets and merchandise such as replica shirts as they lapped up a rare opportunity to watch their heroes in the flesh			1
not a bad little earner			0
gate receipts for the @entity5 's @entity95 totaled almost hk $ 20 million over the two days , according to the @entity96 ( @entity96 ) , but local organizer @entity97 says that the tournament 's use is much wider -- as a vehicle for promoting the @entity12 brand			1
" the issue of whether it makes money is n't the issue , " says @entity103 , chairman of @entity97			2
" it is a very important market for the clubs			2
the benefits are long term			0
" it is a sentiment echoed by @entity1 's new man			0
" it would be unreasonable for us not to do preseasons like this and not touch the amount of fans that we have , " @entity114 , newly installed manager at the club , told @entity0 ahead of the tournament			0
" we have to respect [ both ] our commercial activities and the football planning , and at this moment we have been balancing it properly			1
" fans in @entity86 seem to be grateful that the @entity12 's big guns are concentrating on this region			1
" it 's the first time i 've seen them play and it was a great experience , " says @entity131 , a @entity6 fan who started supporting @entity1 three years ago			0
" i was lucky , a friend gave me tickets			0
" @entity6 is not exactly an undeveloped market for the @entity36 's @entity12			1
in 2006 cable operator @entity138 paid hk $ 1.56 billion ( us $ 200million ) for the broadcast rights to @entity12 games			1
the casual @entity6 fan is likely more familiar with the star names at @entity1 and their counterparts at other high - flying clubs than they are with local professionals			2
expanding a support base is set to become even more important for clubs			0
the sport 's @entity149 governing body , @entity148 , seeks to impose punitive measures on clubs who fail to balance their books			0
beginning in the 2012 - 13 season , the @entity156 ( @entity156 ) rules stress that income should be earned from football - related activities and are designed to straiten those clubs who operate outside of normal profit - and - loss structures			1
clubs found guilty of breaking @entity156 rules will be banned from @entity149 competition -- a huge disincentive given the popularity , prestige and profile that playing in the @entity170 brings			1
cynics will point out that accounting sleights of hand will essentially render @entity156 rules meaningless			1
newly - wealthy @entity33 , for example , recently announced a stadium naming rights deal with @entity176 , the airline wing of their own parent company , @entity178			0
the club 's chief executive , @entity179 , said the deal was " one of the most important arrangements in the history of world football			0
" at $ @entity187 , the 10 - year arrangement is far outside the market price for similar naming rights and it has been suggested that this , amongst other , equally creative ways of getting money into the club provides clubs like @entity33 with a loophole to avoid @entity156 stricture			1
the club 's rivals , including @entity32 's outspoken manager @entity199 , have cried foul of the deal , which @entity199 describes as part of @entity33 's ongoing " financial doping , " giving some teams an unfair advantage over their less wealthy opponents			0
" the credibility of financial fair play is at stake , " @entity199 said at the time of the deal 's announcement			0
" the backdrop is @entity148 's @entity156 and this helps to make significant progress in that area , " @entity179 said when announcing the sponsorship deal			2
" this is not just a wide - ranging agreement			0
it is a long - term commitment			0
" @entity148 are currently looking into the case to determine its legitimacy and they may yet not avoid censure			0
@entity8 football is now a global concern , with teams from the top tier jetting across the globe , trying to pry open new , lucrative markets -- clubs looking to export the passion and excitement of @entity8 football to a new , enthusiastic audience			2
as the playing field soon looks to be leveled , it looks likely that these foreign forays will become even more important to teams looking to stay onside of @entity148 's rules .			0
