-- @entity1 underlined his status as the best player in the world with two inspirational goals and an assist as holders @entity7 cruised into the quarterfinals of the @entity9 with a 4 - 0 victory at home to @entity12 on wednesday night			1
while @entity13 , the world 's most expensive player , was unable to stop @entity16 rivals @entity15 crashing out of @entity18 's premier club competition last week , @entity1 made sure that @entity7 suffered no such embarrassment ahead of friday 's last - eight draw			1
the @entity16 champions will join @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 in the hat along with wednesday 's fellow victors @entity29			1
the @entity31 forward scored the opening goal in the 13th minute to give the @entity34 giants a 2 - 1 lead on aggregate , then helped set up @entity37 nine minutes later before killing off the @entity39 visitors with an opportunist third on the hour			1
@entity7 coach @entity41 opted to start with @entity42 up front alongside @entity1 , leaving expensive pre-season signing @entity43 -- who scored the equalizer in @entity12 last month -- on the bench			2
influential midfielder @entity47 was ruled out by an injury suffered in training on tuesday			0
the hosts started with a fluidity sometimes missing in their @entity53 play this season , and @entity1 made @entity12 pay for giving him too much space as he took the ball from near halfway and lashed in a left - foot shot from just outside the penalty area for his 30th goal of the season			2
@entity1 , who netted a hat - trick against @entity63 on sunday , then set @entity64 free in the penalty box with a delightful angled ball behind the @entity12 defense , and the @entity70 midfielder 's low cross gave young winger @entity37 a simple chance to sidefoot into the net			1
@entity1 teed up @entity64 10 minutes after halftime , but his resulting shot was dragged wide of @entity76 's goal			0
the 22 - year - old showed him how to do it five minutes later as he took a clever flick from @entity80 , turned his man and then placed a low shot into the left - hand corner of @entity76 's net			0
@entity43 came on for injured midfielder @entity85 in the 65th minute , and soon after @entity1 was denied his hat - trick by the veteran @entity76			0
the former @entity39 international belied his 40 years as he got down to his left to keep out @entity1 's header from a towering @entity80 cross			2
@entity1 went close again in the 86th minute as he skipped through the @entity7 defense and dinked a chip past @entity76 , but wide of the goal			2
but @entity76 could do nothing to stop substitute @entity95 slotting in @entity7 's fourth goal three minutes later as the 19 - year - old ran onto @entity43 's well - timed pass			1
@entity99 champions @entity29 also progressed into the last eight with a 2 - 1 victory at home to nine - man @entity103 , beating the @entity105 side 3 - 1 on aggregate despite also having a man sent off			1
@entity108 put @entity29 ahead in the fifth minute with a fine free - kick , and also hit the post with another set - piece			0
@entity103 had striker @entity112 sent off for a second booking on the hour mark , but equalized on the night five minutes later through substitute @entity115			0
@entity29 were also reduced to 10 men in the 69th minute when captain @entity117 was booked for the second time after a seemingly innocuous challenge on @entity119			0
striker @entity120 sealed the tie with two minutes to go when he powerfully headed in a left - wing cross from @entity123 at the far post , then @entity103 saw @entity126 defender @entity125 dismissed for a second booking five minutes into time added on .			0

@entity1 scores twice as holders @entity7 cruised into quarterfinals of @entity9
@entity16 champions beat @entity12 4 - 0 in second *leg* of last - 16 tie at the @entity134
@entity37 and substitute @entity95 also net in 5 - 1 aggregate victory over @entity39
@entity99 champions @entity29 also through after beating @entity103 2 - 1 at home
