-- august 25 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 transcript this is a @entity10			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			0
@entity14 , @entity15 : what does it take to be the most expensive school in @entity19 ? you 're going to find out in the next 10 minutes			1
@entity0 is now in session ! first up : home sales drop @entity25 : first up today : the economy			1
we have a new report about sales in the housing market			1
sales of existing homes -- homes that have already been built -- dropped more than 27 percent in july			1
they have n't been this low in more than 10 years			0
some experts think a big reason for the drop is the fact that the government 's homebuyer tax credit ended			1
basically , that offered people money to help them buy a house			0
without that incentive , the sales went down			1
and the stock market noticed too			0
when the home sales report came out yesterday , the @entity49 took a hit			1
a lot of people use the @entity49 to figure out how the entire stock market is doing			0
obviously , a drop in home sales is a bad thing			1
but why is this such a big deal ? why did it affect the stock market ? some analysts think the drop in home sales is a warning that housing prices might go down			1
they 're concerned that that might make it harder for the @entity19 economy to recover from the recession it 's been in			1
@entity4 @entity25 : turning our attention to the war in @entity4			0
for the first time since that conflict started in 2003 , there are fewer than 50,000 @entity19 troops in the @entity78 country			1
one @entity80 official explained why it 's the right time for a change			1
@entity83 , @entity84 : we can anticipate that @entity86 in @entity4 will try to argue that they have been successful			0
we are reducing our footprint in @entity4 under our terms , and through a transition to over 600,000 @entity4 security forces who have proven up to the task			0
@entity25 : okay , there is still violence in @entity4			0
yesterday , attacks killed at least five people			0
how will that affect the @entity19 troops who are still there ? @entity99 has more on the transition			1
@entity99 , @entity0 correspondent : and end to @entity101 and the beginning , on september 1 , of @entity101			0
now , this is officially being called a non-combat mission that is going to see the @entity19 military in an advise - and - assist capacity			1
this does not , however , mean that the war has somehow miraculously come to an end , or that a switch was flicked that would allow peace and prosperity to flourish in @entity4			0
those troops remaining here will still be wearing their full battle kit when they leave their bases			0
they 'll still be carrying their weapons and they will still be on high alert as this does remain an active and dangerous war zone			0
@entity122 @entity25 : it 's a race with 10 winners			1
it 's the government 's " @entity122 , " an education program that offers money to states who put together plans for school reform			1
35 states and the @entity133 applied for the current round			0
@entity133 was one of the winners , along with @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 , as well as @entity142 , @entity143 , @entity144 and @entity145			0
they 'll split $ 3.4 billion , although how much they get will be based on the number of students in each state			1
so you can expect @entity142 to get a lot more money than @entity139			0
now some critics of " @entity122 " argue that it could end up actually hurting some school districts			1
and others have raised questions about the criteria that led to these states winning out over other states			0
is this legit ? @entity162 , @entity15 : is this legit ? wind speed determines the difference between a tropical storm and a hurricane			0
it 's true ! a tropical storm becomes a hurricane when its sustained winds reach 74 miles per hour			1
@entity171 @entity25 : and that 's why @entity173 became @entity171 monday evening			1
though yesterday , it did drop back down to a tropical storm			1
@entity173 is the fourth named storm of this year 's @entity178 hurricane season , but it 's only the second storm to become a hurricane			1
it 's out in the middle of the @entity178 , and the @entity183 says that it probably wo n't hit land			2
most @entity185 @entity25 : most expensive @entity19 school ever			1
this place opens next month in @entity5 , @entity6			0
and take a look at it : it 's not only big , it 's luxurious			1
an auditorium modeled after a famous nightclub			0
seating like an upscale restaurant			0
a basketball court floored in maple wood			0
your school does n't have this stuff ! then again , your school did n't cost $ 578 million			2
the @entity200 is a complex for kindergarten through 12th grade			0
it 'll fit 4,200 students			2
it is a public school ! the area 's superintendent says now the poorest children in his school system will have one of the most beautiful learning environments			1
but in a district that 's cut academic programs and laid off almost 3,000 teachers in the past two years , some say this just goes way too far			2
@entity5 officials say it was planned before the recession , and that the money did n't come out of @entity6 's indebted education budget , but from bonds that voters approved			2
@entity225 @entity25 : but as they say , the proof is in the puddin '			0
will a school like this improve students ' education ? we want you to comment on this on our blog			1
what makes a good school , good ? is it in the facility itself ? or is it in the students or teachers or ... what do you think ? talk to us at @entity248 ! @entity249 @entity250 , @entity15 : time for the shoutout ! what is the official currency of @entity7 ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it the : a ) @entity259 or @entity260 ) @entity261 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! @entity7 's official currency is the yen			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! yen v $ dollar @entity25 : different currencies get compared against each other to figure out how strong they are			2
right now , the yen is doing great ! against the @entity19 dollar , the yen is higher than it has been in 15 years			1
but that can be bad news for expatriates in @entity7 , people who live there but who were n't born there			1
@entity275 helps makes cents out of all this			0
( begin video ) @entity278 , @entity279 , @entity280 : @entity19 @entity281 and @entity282 are getting a crash course in the currency market			1
@entity285 , @entity19 expatriate : i 'm kinda surprised , actually			1
the yen is so high now			0
@entity289 , @entity291 's wife : i feel like my income is really decreased from that time			2
@entity293 : your income did n't change , it 's just currency			1
@entity298 : yeah , it 's not changed , i know			2
it 's only the currency			1
@entity301 , @entity19 expatriate : going down , down , down			1
@entity293 : that 's the paycheck pain shared by expatriates who get paid in dollars or euros and have to pay for food in yen			1
but it 's the opposite side of the coin across town at the @entity311 bus station			2
the @entity312 are heading off to an overseas vacation			0
@entity314 , @entity315 [ @entity316 ] : " i upgraded the room and reserved a more expensive restaurant , " says @entity320			2
@entity293 : they 're planning their next getaway before they 've even taken off on this one			0
that 's the power of their yen overseas			2
what it boils down to is the value of the @entity19 dollar			1
let 's say these sushi erasers cost 100 yen			2
three years ago , given the value of the @entity19 dollar , i would have spent 79 cents in the exchange			1
for the exact same sushi erasers , i now have to spend $ 1.18			0
analysts say this reflects the overall global downward trend of the @entity19 dollar			1
@entity337 , @entity338 : currency does reflect such a trend in the world economy			2
@entity293 : professor @entity342 says that trend is the move away from the @entity19 and @entity345 to developing superpowers of @entity347 and @entity348			1
currency is just the symptom of a world 's economy shifting its center of gravity			1
@entity354 : they indicate the further weakness of the @entity19 economy			1
this trend we have experienced in the last month or so will probably accelerate			0
@entity293 : that spells trouble for big exporters like @entity363 , who at this recent earnings announcement based its sheets on a 90 yen			2
analysts say @entity363 loses an estimated $ 250 million when the dollar dips one yen on the currency market			2
@entity291 : checking out the food , we 're just moving in			0
@entity293 : and it means tough times for the @entity374 , who are new @entity280 transplants			0
learning to live without , while their @entity7 counterparts live it up			1
@entity275 , @entity0 , @entity280			0
( @entity379 ) before we go @entity25 : we 've been doing a lot of animal stories for our " before we go " segment lately , and some are cute			2
this , you might could go either way on			0
it 's about ... well let 's just say i smell a rat			2
and it smells great ! or at least it 's going to after its bath			2
an ireporter sent in this video of his rat @entity398 -- he named it @entity398 -- @entity398 apparently loves taking baths and does all the washing herself			0
you can see right here : she 's got her whiskers , her face ... she might 've missed a spot			2
nope , she got it			0
there is another possibility here , that @entity398 does n't like getting wet , does n't like taking baths , but her owner dunked her in the sink anyway			0
goodbye @entity25 : and now she 's trapped like a.			2
well , maybe the owner just wanted to show off his pet 's good hygeine			2
either way , we totally had to rat him out			0
we 're going to scurry away for now			0
in the meantime , do n't forget to head to our blog at @entity248			0
talk to us about what makes a great school great			0
we will look forward to seeing you on thursday			0
thanks for joining us .			0
