, because everyone 's favorite nasal - voiced man - child in the red bow tie and too - small gray suit is back			2
" i know you are , but what am i ? " earlier this week , " @entity7 " was released on blu - ray by @entity10 ! factory			1
the restoration of the series was truly a labor of love for @entity16 -- the creator and alter - ego of the @entity20 character			1
@entity16 personally supervised the frame - by - frame remastering of the original 16mm film -- a yearlong project			1
the set includes all 45 episodes , over four hours of all - new bonus features , and the beloved @entity27 special			1
it 's hard to believe that " @entity7 " -- the critically - acclaimed , whip - smart show that garnered 22 @entity34 -- actually got its start as a parody of children 's television shows			1
@entity16 drew inspiration from the shows he loved as a child , such as " the @entity38 , " " @entity39 " and " the @entity40			1
" the character of pee - wee originated in @entity16 ' stage show , " @entity43 " at the @entity45 theater in @entity46 , later transferred to the @entity48 theater and was turned into a 1981 @entity49 special			1
the stage show garnered @entity16 a deal for the 1985 feature film " @entity55 , " which was directed by then - newcomer @entity53 ; which led to the tv series			1
premiering on @entity56 in 1986 , " @entity7 " was a modified , made - for - kids version of the stage show			1
it became appointment television right out of the gate			0
children , parents and even college students could n't wait for saturday mornings with the mischievous , fun - loving , obnoxious , sweet , curious , hyperactive @entity20			0
in one of the interviews featured in the blu - ray extras , executive producer @entity63 recalled that on the morning of september 13 , 1986 , the day the show premiered , @entity56 still had n't seen the pilot			1
the network had been begging for a screener for weeks , but @entity63 , @entity16 and staff were editing the episode down to the wire			2
@entity63 hand - delivered the final product to @entity56 at 6:45 a.m. it was broadcast at 9 a.m. that 's not to say that the " @entity7 " crew was lax in any way , shape or form			1
on the contrary , the series ' attention to detail was one of the attributes that made it so special			0
these were the pre-digital art days , and " @entity7 " featured a mind - boggling medley of @entity92 , stop - motion animation , cartoon animation and live action including puppetry			1
all the artwork was either hand - painted , hand - drawn or sculpted			0
as if that was n't quite enough art , the show was shot on film			0
clocking in at just under two - and - a - half minutes , the " @entity7 " theme song was , and remains , exceptionally long			1
it opened with a @entity92 beaver and slowly segued into the hyper - fast song , sung by @entity106 under the pseudonym " @entity106 , " then name - checked every inhabitant of the @entity7			1
most household items were alive , from the windows to the flowers to the floor to the ham in the fridge			0
there was also the wacky @entity116 ( which feared the dentist and was a cousin of @entity119 ) , @entity7 the robot ( who provided each day 's secret word ) , @entity123 the globe , @entity126 the clock and @entity7 the chair			2
humans who dropped by the @entity7 included miss @entity129 , @entity130 and @entity131 the mail lady , among many others			2
some of the other @entity134 were @entity135 the genie , @entity137 the @entity138 and the @entity139			0
as educational as it was artistic and offbeat , " @entity7 " contained enough double - entendres to keep the adults chuckling , and it sure was n't afraid to be just plain silly			1
one of the running pee - wee jokes was the " why do n't you marry it ? " comeback in which someone would proclaim their love for something , and pee - wee or another character would challenge the person with the aforementioned retort			2
in the season - two slumber party episode , pee - wee did , in fact , marry a bowl of fruit salad			0
pee - wee : " mmm ! fruity ! i love fruit salad ! " @entity166 attendees in unison : " then why do n't you marry it ! " pee - wee : " all right then			0
" smash - cut to pee - wee and a bowl of fruit salad ( wearing a veil ) saying vows and sealing it with a kiss			0
@entity16 had total creative control over " @entity7 , " and he also insisted on a racially and ethnically diverse cast and crew			1
much of the early staff had never worked in tv before			0
most were still in film or art school or had just graduated			0
during the summer of 1987 , one - day - to - be @entity188 - nominated director @entity186 was a security guard on the set who occasionally took on " playhouse " production assistant gigs			0
at the time , he was a film school student at the @entity193			0
@entity194 ( @entity130 ) recalled @entity186 telling him about the screenplay he was writing , and that he would one day direct @entity194 in a film			0
the script @entity186 was working on became 1991 's " @entity198			0
" true to his word , the young director fought , and won , for @entity194 to play the now - iconic role of @entity202			0
" @entity7 " ended its original run in november 1990 and since then , it 's been a mixed bag			2
there was @entity16 ' shocking 1991 arrest , his triumphant return as pee - wee later that year at the @entity211 and then , not much			1
more recently , 2010 's popular " @entity43 on @entity215 " was turned into an @entity49 special and now it seems like the pee - wee machine is kicking into high gear			0
@entity16 told @entity216 this week that a big announcement about a new pee - wee movie is " imminent			1
" today , " @entity7 " is a pop culture staple			2
a cult favorite , it taught lessons in an off - the - wall way that was rooted in never , ever talking down to kids			2
the points @entity16 really wanted to get across were : do n't repress your creativity , never stop asking questions , and it 's ok to let your freak flag fly			2
above all , however , he wanted to make children laugh .			0
