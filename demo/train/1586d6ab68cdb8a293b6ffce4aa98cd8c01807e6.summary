@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 was not armed but did put up resistance when @entity8 forces stormed a compound outside @entity10 and killed him , @entity4 spokesman @entity3 said tuesday			1
@entity3 , reading a narrative drawn up by the @entity12 , provided new details of the events that transpired early monday when 25 @entity15 in two @entity17 helicopters landed outside the compound in @entity0 , about 50 kilometers ( 31 miles ) north of @entity10			1
" they had to breach through walls , " cia director @entity19 , who commanded the mission and was in contact with the 25 commandos as it unfolded , told @entity24			2
live blog : @entity5 operation there were no armed guards around the compound , said a @entity8 official who asked not to be identified because the official was not authorized to speak on the record			1
in an operation that lasted nearly 40 minutes , the @entity15 -- working in two groups -- methodically cleared the compound , where three families were living , @entity3 said			1
one group went to a separate building in the compound ; the other to the three - story building housing a family on the first floor and @entity5 and his family on the second and third floors , @entity3 said			1
on the first floor of @entity5 's building , two @entity48 couriers were killed , as was a woman who was caught in the crossfire , @entity3 said			1
@entity5 killing caps decade - long manhunt continuing their ascent to the second and third floors , the commandos found @entity5 and his wife , both of whom were unarmed , in a room , @entity3 said			1
" she rushed one of the @entity8 assaulters and was shot in the leg but not killed , " he said			1
" @entity5 was then shot and killed			1
" the @entity8 official said @entity5 was shot when he made a threatening move			1
in all , said the @entity8 official who sought anonymity , five of the approximately two dozen people in the compound were killed -- the two couriers , the woman , @entity5 and his son			1
officials have not publicly identified everyone who was in the compound			2
materials taken from the compound included 10 hard drives , five computers and more than 100 storage devices , such as disks , dvds and thumb drives , a senior @entity8 official told @entity2 tuesday			2
@entity15 , " the quiet professionals " that material is being reviewed , said @entity85 , president @entity86 's top counterterrorism adviser			2
in his first public comments on the raid , attorney general @entity87 tuesday declared the operation " lawful , legitimate and appropriate in every way			1
" @entity8 officials have said they might release a post-mortem photo taken of @entity5			1
there are " a lot to choose from , " and most are " very graphic , " a senior government official said			2
what photos could show the officials have said dna matching shows @entity5 was killed			1
but the @entity101 have questioned the assertion			2
" @entity86 has not got any strong evidence that can prove his claim over killing of the @entity107 , " @entity101 spokesman @entity103 said			2
" and secondly , the closest sources for @entity107 have not confirmed " the death , he added			2
the @entity1 @entity110 , meanwhile , issued a statement tuesday saying that members of @entity5 's family were " in safe hands and being looked after in accordance with law			1
some of them needing medical care are under treatment in the best possible facilities			2
as per policy , they will be handed over to their countries of origin			0
" the jubilation in many parts of the world over @entity5 's killing gave way tuesday to increasing questions about how the world 's most - wanted terrorist could have hidden in a populated area two miles from the prestigious @entity136 military academy , the @entity137 of @entity1			1
" how did @entity5 stay at that compound for about six years or so and be undetected ? " @entity85 asked			1
" what type of support did he have outside of that compound in the @entity0 area or more broadly within @entity1 ? we 're going to look carefully at this and get to the bottom of it all			0
" raid sparks questions : is @entity1 doing enough ? the mission took place without @entity1 leadership being informed beforehand , @entity8 officials said			0
" it was decided that any effort to work with the @entity1 could jeopardize the mission , " @entity19 told @entity154			0
" they might alert the targets			0
" however , @entity85 insisted that " @entity1 has been a strong partner in the effort to destroy @entity48			0
" in a @entity163 column , @entity1 president @entity161 expressed satisfaction " that the source of the greatest evil of the new millennium has been silenced , and his victims given justice " and defended his country 's actions			2
" some in the @entity8 press have suggested that @entity1 lacked vitality in its pursuit of terrorism , or worse yet that we were disingenuous and actually protected the terrorists we claimed to be pursuing			0
such baseless speculation may make exciting cable news , but it does n't reflect fact , " @entity161 wrote			0
@entity154 : @entity183 chief on why @entity1 was n't told the foreign ministry called @entity5 's death " an important milestone in the fight against terrorism , " but also expressed " deep concerns " about the fact that @entity8 officials failed to notify the government of @entity1 prior to the attack			1
" this event of unauthorized unilateral action can not be taken as a rule , " the statement said			0
" such actions undermine cooperation and may also sometime constitute ( a ) threat to international peace and security			0
" the senior @entity1 intelligence official who spoke tuesday to @entity2 said , " yes , we did fail to locate him			0
yes , we are embarrassed			0
but that does not mean we are incompetent and straddling the fence			0
" @entity8 anticipates @entity48 threats the compound where @entity5 was holed up was surrounded by walls 10 to 18 feet tall and topped by barbed wire			1
it sat far from a main road , secluded			0
how @entity48 and its adherents will be affected remains an open question			0
" leadership in @entity48 tends to be replaced , " former defense secretary @entity215 told @entity2 tuesday			0
" i expect there will be someone who will step up			0
" @entity215 , who was in office during the september 11 attacks , praised @entity222 administration policies that came under heated criticism			0
noting that tracking one of @entity5 's trusted couriers led the @entity8 to identify @entity5 's location , @entity215 defended the @entity222 administration 's practice of detaining low - level people , a practice that critics derided as unwarranted			1
" it is those individuals that know the habits and locations of the senior people , " he said			0
no obvious successor to @entity5 @entity215 also stood by the use of waterboarding , which the @entity86 administration has outlawed as torture			1
@entity215 said the information taken from three people who were waterboarded and passed on to then - @entity183 director @entity244 proved to be " enormously valuable			0
" however , @entity4 spokesman @entity3 said monday 's events had not changed @entity86 's opposition to so - called enhanced interrogation techniques			1
@entity19 said he too saw no need for a return to using such techniques			0
" obviously , there was some valuable information that was derived through those kinds of interrogations , but i guess the question that everybody will always debate is whether or not those approaches had to be used in order to get the same information , " he told @entity252			0
" and that , frankly , is an open question			0
" @entity2 's @entity264 , @entity265 , @entity266 , @entity267 , @entity268 , @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 , @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 and @entity276 contributed to this report .			2
