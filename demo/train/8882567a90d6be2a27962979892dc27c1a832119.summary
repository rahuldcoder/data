@entity0 -- @entity3 - winning presidential historian @entity2 notes each inauguration is moving in its own way , but only a few produce moments that are truly memorable			1
" it depends upon the person and the occasion to really produce a historic inaugural speech , " @entity8 said			2
" but the ceremony itself ... is a real tribute to the country , that a person who was the president can go out and become a private citizen ( while ) a new private citizen is becoming the president			1
" " it 's peaceful , " she says , and " that 's an extraordinary thing in the history of our world			1
" here are 10 inaugural moments that @entity8 says have stood the test of time : 2009 : @entity29 makes history there was a magic to the inaugural day for president @entity29			1
... ( it was ) as if the whole history of our country was coming full circle -- the ending of slavery and now the first @entity42 - @entity41 president			1
so the crowds were reveling in that spirit -- 1.8 million ( people ) , more than had ever been there before			2
the great reset : will @entity29 's second inauguration let @entity41 turn the page ? just the idea that we had come this far as a nation			1
there was a sense of unity and a sense of pride , i think , in our country that this was finally happening			1
1981 : @entity60 's optimistic first inaugural speech what was so impressive about @entity60 's inaugural speech , i think , was the optimism that it suggested after a period when @entity41 was feeling like we might have been in decline			1
even though he had the exact opposite message as @entity70 , where he was talking about government as the problem rather than the solution , both @entity60 and @entity70 shared that @entity41 sense that we can do things			1
inauguration viewer 's guide in a certain sense , the optimism of the speech was symbolized by ( @entity60 's ) transferring the inaugural to the @entity83 of the @entity84 , which made a much grander spectacle			1
more people could watch it , so it was a big occasion			0
1977 : @entity90 's long walk @entity90 made the decision evidently just three weeks before the inauguration that he would walk after his inauguration back to the @entity94			1
and it really was an extraordinary moment			0
... there was a feeling with @entity90 that he was being a people 's president , as opposed to the imperial guard that had surrounded @entity100			2
and so he 's walking , ( and first daughter ) @entity101 is running around next to him			2
there 's a sense of exuberance , and a sense that something special is happening			2
why sunday ? @entity29 's dual inauguration ceremonies honor tradition and law 1961 : @entity111 's stirring address what is so memorable about @entity111 saying that the torch is being passed to a new generation is that he himself represented a new generation			1
( he was ) 22 years younger than @entity117 , and what the speech promised was action , movement , ( and ) a new energy coming into the government and into the country			1
when we think of those famous words -- " ask not what your country can do for you , but what you can do for the country " -- it was followed up by thousands of people wanting to join the @entity129 , and the @entity130 was already out there			2
there was a sense of working on poverty , so the words projected action , and that 's what makes them memorable			1
@entity143 : i hope @entity29 will ... what always strikes me about @entity111 's inaugural ( address ) , however , is that he said in the course of it ... that all this would not be accomplished in 1,000 days , meaning the programs that he had outlined			1
originally in the draft of it , he had said all of this would not be accomplished in 100 days , but he slashed it out because he did not want to be compared to @entity70 's 100 days			1
but little would he ever imagine that 1,000 days would mark the end of his life , and that that would be his presidency			0
1945 : @entity70 's abbreviated wartime ceremony @entity70 decided in 1945 , when the war was still ongoing , to dispense with the traditional parade			1
who is there to parade , he said , and so he made it a very simple ceremony ( at the @entity94 )			0
@entity170 pastor , @entity172 ' widow named to speak at inauguration he himself was suffering from heart failure at that time , so it was a five - minute speech and he needed to fortify himself with whiskey in order to get through the pain that he was feeling			0
so sadly , the physical state of @entity70 matched the mood at that time			1
1933 : @entity70 's dramatic first inaugural speech we all remember the phrase " the only thing we have to fear is fear itself , " but even more important than the phrase was the attitude that @entity70 had			1
he projected optimism , he projected forward movement , and people felt -- that 's the mystery of leadership -- that somehow the ( @entity197 ) depression they were suffering ( through ) , they were n't going to be in it alone anymore			2
... they had a leader who was going to take care of it			0
@entity203 , however , was very upset during the transition about what @entity70 did not do			1
he was hoping some action would be taking place while he was still president , but @entity70 wanted to wait ( and ) have a clean slate while he was president			1
... @entity203 was very angry about that , and there was lots of tension between the two			0
1905 : @entity214 's eclectic parade what 's interesting about @entity214 's inaugural parade is that it symbolized the many - sided character that @entity214 was			2
so there you have @entity222 alums marching side by side with @entity225 , marching side by side with cowboys , with @entity229			0
... and chief @entity230 was there			0
there was a sense in which @entity214 had so many interests			0
there were different sides of him , and the parade symbolized that			0
it just seemed like this incredibly eclectic parade			0
@entity242 : ' my obligation ' to attend the inauguration 1865 : @entity246 strives to unite @entity247 what 's so extraordinary about @entity246 's second inaugural is that here the @entity247 is finally on the eve of winning this long @entity251 , but no triumphal message does he deliver			1
... he talks about the fact that the sin of slavery was shared by both sides			0
both sides read the same @entity259			0
both prayed to same @entity261			0
of course the words we remember -- with malice toward none and charity for all			1
@entity246 knew that inaugural spoke words that would be remembered			1
he was n't as sure about some of his other speeches , but he knew that			0
a-listers sign up for inaugural celebrations when he went into the party after the inaugural , the one person who he wanted to know and get his approval from was @entity280 , the abolitionist			0
and @entity280 came over to him and said , ' mr. president , it 's a sacred effort			2
' 1841 : the tragedy of @entity285 it 's so sad that what we remember @entity285 for is not ( his ) military service before the presidency , but the fact that he gave the longest inaugural ( speech ) and had the shortest presidency			2
he insisted on not wearing a coat ( during the ceremony )			0
it was freezing out , he developed pneumonia , and he died			0
that is the memory of @entity285			0
i 'm sure it 's not the way he would hope to be remembered			2
they finally learned from @entity285 's inaugural			2
... when it was freezing weather during @entity60 's ( second ) inaugural they moved it inside and canceled the parade			1
it 's one of the dangers of having these inaugurations in january or even in march in the old days			2
1789 : @entity0 sets the tone the thing that 's so interesting ( about ) @entity0 's inaugural is that it set so many precedents			1
even in that week before his inaugural , they were debating what to call him			0
some people like @entity324 wanted the president to be called his @entity326 or his highness			0
@entity328 said , ' no , it must simply be " mr. president			0
" ' @entity324 said , ' that 's nothing			2
he could be president of a garden club			0
it wo n't be dignified for the world at large			0
' but of course ( @entity0 ) becomes mr. president			1
everything was setting a pattern			0
it was an extraordinary moment			0
share your inauguration photos on @entity143			0

2009 : " ( it was ) as if the whole history of our country was coming full circle "
