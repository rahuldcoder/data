@entity0 -- responding to the uproar over physical searches of children , the @entity4 is rolling out new procedures that should reduce , although not eliminate , the number of times children are patted down at airport checkpoints			1
under the new procedures , children age 12 and younger will be allowed to keep their shoes on , the @entity4 said			1
if a metal detector or full - body image detects a suspicious object , the children will be allowed multiple passes through the machines in an effort to identify the anomaly			1
finally , airport screeners will have the option of swabbing the children 's hands to check for explosive residue as an alternative to patting down the children			1
@entity25 downs will be used only if concerns persist			0
homeland security secretary @entity27 on tuesday told a @entity29 committee the @entity4 will roll out the new procedures in the coming weeks and months			2
" it does require additional training of all of the thousands of @entity4 officers and that 's under way , " she said			2
in the spring , the @entity4 modified the actual pat down procedures , refining the parts of the body officers touch , amid widespread criticism that the pat downs were too intrusive			1
since then , the @entity4 has been testing a variety of protocols to see if it could address public concerns without jeopardizing security			2
the pilot program , which has been going on since august at six airports , has shown the @entity4 could reduce the number of times it has had to pat down children , a @entity4 official said			1
the six airports are @entity51 , @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56			0
the furor over screening of children erupted in spring after a video posted on @entity60 showed a 6 - year - old girl being searched at @entity63 airport on april 5			0
the girl protests the search at first , although she complies quietly while it is under way			0
@entity4 chief @entity67 said at a @entity69 hearing in spring that a female security screener performed the pat down on the girl because the child had moved while passing through the imaging machine			2
that prevented the device from getting a clear reading			0
@entity67 suggested then that a pat down of a child is not entirely unjustified			0
" unfortunately we know that terrorists around the world have used children as suicide bombers , " @entity67 said .			0
