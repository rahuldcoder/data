-- a-list celebrities and big pay packets are overflowing in the @entity4 dressing room , but you wo n't find @entity6 complaining			1
in fact he is absolutely delighted that @entity9 has joined him at @entity4			1
was it because of @entity9 's ability to hit pinpoint crosses and corner kicks ? that helps			1
but mostly @entity9 's arrival in the @entity17 capital has meant the paparazzi are leaving @entity6 in peace			1
the 31 - year - old @entity20 was sold to @entity4 from @entity21 as part of a summer clear - out by the @entity24 club while @entity9 , one of the most recognized people in the world , signed with the @entity17 club on a free transfer in january			1
" i think it 's good for me that @entity9 came so he gets more attention than me , so they leave me a little bit alone , " @entity6 told @entity0			1
" since i came here , everybody said do n't worry , as a football player you can walk in the city and nobody will disturb you because as a football player it is not like it is in @entity24			0
" but since the day i came here it 's been totally stressful			0
everybody is chasing me with their scooters			0
i do n't even walk in the streets			0
" so when @entity9 came he got more of the media ( attention )			2
that 's good because he takes care of that and i can play football and focus on football			0
" when @entity4 signed @entity9 , many said the move was simply an exercise in public relations meant to bolster the profile of the team , which is backed by wealthy @entity60 owners -- the @entity61			1
but @entity9 has been frequently used by @entity4 coach @entity62 , though the @entity63 was criticized by the @entity17 press for his performance against @entity66 -- one of @entity6 's former teams -- in the @entity70 quarterfinals last week when the sides played to a 2 - 2 first - leg tie in @entity73			1
a surprise starter , @entity9 was substituted with 20 minutes remaining			2
experience however @entity6 believes that the former @entity78 captain 's experience will help @entity4 as it seeks to upset @entity66 and also claim the @entity17 league title for the first time since 1994			1
" i think he has been very important for us , " @entity6 said			2
" the club has been changing from a normal club to a top club and @entity9 gives you some kind of confidence			2
" he has a quality , big quality			0
he has a touch that i have n't seen many players have			0
and he is very elegant when he plays			0
" despite the criticism leveled at @entity9 , @entity62 has said he would once again start the midfielder in wednesday 's second leg			1
if the game at the @entity97 is as dramatic as the first leg at the @entity99 , fans should expect a memorable evening			0
after @entity100 gave @entity66 a first - half lead , @entity6 drew @entity4 level from an offside position in the 79th minute before @entity104 restored the visitors ' one - goal advantage with an 89th minute penalty			1
but instead of the visitor walking away with a 2 - 1 victory , @entity108 boosted @entity4 's second - leg prospects with a deflected effort four minutes into injury time			2
another boost for @entity4 would come if @entity100 does n't play wednesday , and he is a doubt after sustaining a hamstring injury in the first leg			2
after the first leg , @entity66 lodged an official complaint to @entity119 , angered about the standard of refereeing			0
besides @entity6 's offside goal , the @entity122 were upset that @entity125 referee @entity124 allowed play to continue when @entity127 and @entity128 collided in the second half , leaving both @entity66 defenders prone on the ground			1
@entity132 will be favored to advance against @entity133 in wednesday 's other quarterfinal second leg , holding a 2 - 0 advantage			0
@entity136 and @entity137 progressed tuesday to reach the semifinals .			0

@entity6 says less people chase him now that @entity9 is around
@entity6 joined @entity4 in the summer and @entity9 arrived in january
@entity6 says @entity9 's experience will help @entity4 for the rest of the *season*
