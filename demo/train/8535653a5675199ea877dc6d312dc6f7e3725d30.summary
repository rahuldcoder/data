@entity0 -- when president @entity4 awards the @entity5 to staff sgt. @entity6 on tuesday , a lot will be made about the fact that he is the first living @entity5 recipient since @entity9			1
to be exact , @entity6 is the first living recipient since president @entity11 presented @entity5 to three heroes of @entity9 on march 4 , 1976			1
the men who received the iconic gold medal on a pale blue ribbon that day -- @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 -- continued to make history after receiving their medals			1
refusing to talk @entity16 was a @entity23 pilot and the highest ranking prisoner of war in @entity9			1
" i believe i had the easiest leadership job in the world : to maintain the organization , resistance and spirit of 10 of the finest men i have ever known , " @entity16 wrote later in his book " a @entity9 experience : ten years of reflection			1
" while in captivity , @entity16 stabbed himself in the leg to convince his captors he would n't talk			1
after that , the official medal citation says , @entity9 eased " employment of excessive harassment and torture toward all of the prisoners of war			1
" @entity16 went on to become a president of the @entity45 and eventually ran for vice president with @entity47			1
@entity16 died in 2005 and is buried at the @entity48			1
resisting interrogation @entity50 , an @entity51 pilot , was held as a pow for years in @entity9 , often in the same prison as @entity16			1
day was badly injured when he was shot down and shot later during an escape attempt			1
even though he was debilitated , the @entity9 subjected him to frequent torture			1
years later , during an online chat with viewers of @entity58 , @entity17 described what his ordeal in the hands of @entity9 captors was like			2
" they would punish you			2
they would rope you up or beat you up or torture you in some fashion until you made a response of some kind , " @entity17 wrote			1
" if someone has unrestricted torture ability , there 's a lot they can do			2
our population had a 40 percent injury rate			2
they were a fragile group who could be exploited with a great deal of physical pain			2
" according to @entity17 's @entity5 citation , his refusal to talk to his captors protected other pilots			2
" his personal bravery in the face of deadly enemy pressure was significant in saving the lives of fellow aviators who were still flying against the enemy			2
" his legal battle with the government over medical benefits for veterans led to a law that guarantees that military retirees and their spouses will have medical benefits for life			2
day later became a member of the @entity112 , a political group opposed to sen. @entity114 's presidential candidacy in 2004			0
he was also an outspoken supporter of sen. @entity116 's 2008 presidential run			0
rescuing captured pilot @entity18 was a @entity119			0
@entity18 volunteered to go more than a mile into enemy territory to rescue lt. col. @entity121 , a captured pilot who had valuable information about @entity124 missiles and targets that his captors , the @entity9 , would want to learn			0
@entity18 later learned that 30,000 @entity9 and @entity129 fighters were combing the area for him			0
" i was almost constantly in a position where i could have been killed , " @entity18 told the @entity131 in 1976			1
" the fact that the danger is there is something you do n't even worry about			0
" @entity18 ' rescue of @entity139 is the inspiration for the book and movie " @entity143			0
" in spite of losing an eye in a later @entity119 mission in @entity9 , @entity18 became an original member of the @entity149 's elite @entity148			0
all three were alive when president @entity11 presented them with the @entity5			0
@entity151 awarded a fourth @entity5 that day			0
it was a posthumous medal to @entity124 @entity51 captain @entity153 , another pilot who endured repeated torture without divulging any information to the @entity9			0
righting a wrong there have been other living @entity5 recipients in the years since 1976 , but those were retroactive awards			1
because of racism during past wars , or because more information about heroics comes to light , the @entity161 reinvestigates a service member 's actions and decides he deserves a @entity5			0
the latest recipient , @entity6 , will receive the award three years after his heroics			1
he was recommended for a @entity5 hours after a bloody ambush and firefight in eastern @entity174 in 2007			0
it has taken until now for the medal to be approved			0
another @entity5 may be awarded relatively soon			0
@entity1 has learned that a young @entity177 from @entity178 , @entity179 , has been recommended for a @entity5 for heroics in september 2009 in @entity174 's @entity181			0
his case is now being considered at the highest levels of the @entity161 .			0

@entity6 is the first living recipient since 1976
other living recipients continued to make history
