@entity0 -- close observers of @entity3 will know that sheikh tamim bin @entity4 , whose succession to the @entity8 state 's leadership was announced by his father on tuesday morning , has played an increasingly central role in shaping the country 's direction in recent years			1
as heir apparent , @entity13 has led on the implementation of @entity16 , @entity3 's ambitious national strategy which sets out to promote " justice , benevolence and equality			1
" he is also the author of the country 's current five - year plan , in which he calls for " continuous modernization and development of public institutions			0
" the key question now is whether these finely crafted state strategy documents @entity13 has authored as heir apparent can translate into real human rights change in @entity3 's institutions , as the rubber hits the road and he takes control of government			1
the current five - year strategy , for example , promises that there will be much - needed laws to criminalise domestic violence and to give labour rights to migrant domestic workers , something for which campaigners have been calling for years			0
the strategy leaves no room for disagreement when it says that " since 2004 @entity3 has seen a significant jump in the number of reported domestic violence incidents against women and children			2
" but when @entity53 met government officials in @entity55 earlier this year , they played down incidents of domestic violence as merely " individual cases "			0
and a senior @entity60 official recently told a @entity3 newspaper that " there is no need for a law for housemaids ... since there is a contract signed between a maid and her employer , a law is n't needed			2
" @entity16 also says it embodies the principles of the country 's constitution which " protects public and personal freedoms "			1
and yet there was widespread shock last november , when a court in @entity55 sentenced a @entity3 poet , @entity78 , to life imprisonment on charges of incitement " to overthrow the ruling system " , and " insulting the @entity83			2
" the charges relate to a 2010 poem criticizing the ruling family , but activists believed that the real reason for his arrest was his 2011 " @entity91 " which read : " we are all @entity92 in the face of the repressive elite			0
" all the information available points to @entity97 being placed behind bars solely for his words			0
at the time one regional activist told @entity53 that " we expected better , " referring to @entity3 's efforts to paint itself as a country promoting freedom of expression , as host to both the @entity108 network and the @entity109			1
disturbingly , almost at the same time , the authorities moved to tighten control on freedom of expression with a new draft media law , which , if approved , would require all publications to be approved by a government - appointed " competent authority " empowered to remove content or prevent printing			1
@entity121 's sentence was reduced to 15 years in february , which has done little to quell the outrage			0
the treatment of his case will be an early signal of whether @entity3 's new ruler intends to allow greater freedoms of expression at home			1
@entity13 has also chaired the committee organizing the @entity132 , the country 's most ambitious global initiative yet			1
it is a sensitive project and one that will test the new ruler 's commitment to real reform			2
since @entity3 won the right to host the tournament , the country has come under intense scrutiny for its treatment of migrant construction workers , who come primarily from @entity146			2
there are fears that the hundreds of thousands of new workers who will be needed to build the stadiums and infrastructure for the @entity132 could face exploitation or even forced labor			0
@entity53 has been interviewing migrant laborers and construction companies in @entity3 over the past nine months , and has found that the abuse of migrant laborers runs deep , with some workers on major national projects going for months without being paid , being prevented from leaving the country by their employers and even struggling to afford food			0
the challenge for the @entity165 is how to ensure that the companies they employ to build their projects comply with international labor standards			0
of course , it can not be only about the organizing committee			0
the role of the government to prevent entrenched exploitation will be critical			0
@entity13 's five - year plan recognizes -- with slightly surprising candor -- that " improving labor rights will not only benefit employees but will also enhance @entity3 's global image as a leading and progressive nation			1
" but @entity3 's new ruler will need to be aware that the opposite will also be true			1
unless his government is able to energetically enforce labor protections and make major reforms to the repressive @entity186 which gives employers excessive powers over their workers , @entity3 's global image will inevitably suffer , just as the migrant workers @entity53 has met are suffering right now			1
@entity13 and his ministers will need to show political will if they want to deliver the freedom and justice called for in the state strategy set under his stewardship			2
activists , across the region and globally , will be watching carefully for early signs of that will			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity204 .			0

@entity3 's emir hands over power to son , @entity13
@entity13 has led on the implementation of @entity16 , @entity3 's reform program
meanwhile , authorities tighten control on freedom of expression , says @entity204
@entity204 says world will watch closely for early signs of real will to change
