-- the @entity2 government wants to declassify certain broad statistics about its electronic surveillance programs , hoping to prevent @entity5 and @entity6 from releasing more - detailed information about government data requests , @entity0 has learned			1
the government on friday is expected to ask the @entity10 -- the secret court overseeing the programs -- to accept its plan as a compromise , a @entity2 official with knowledge of the plan said			1
in the compromise , the government would release how many metadata requests , broken down by types of requests , it has made of telecommunications and @entity24 companies , the official said			1
opinion : does our government trust us ? metadata includes time and duration of calls , and other basic information -- not the actual substance of the information , which would require a separate search warrant			2
the court gave the government until friday to come up with a position on @entity5 and @entity6 's request to release , on their own , statistics on the metadata requests the government made of them under the @entity44			1
the data would be broken down by request type -- such as whether they were made through criminal investigations , @entity50 national security letters or court orders			0
@entity6 lashed out at the government 's moves to limit how much data the companies can release			1
@entity55 , @entity6 general counsel , in a blogpost said the company would stand with its rival @entity5 to challenge the government and " will move forward with litigation in the hope that the courts will uphold our right to speak more freely			1
" the companies have engaged in talks with government lawyers for weeks			2
@entity55 said the companies want to " publish information that clearly shows the number of national security demands for user content , such as the text of an email , " separate from metadata requests			0
he said the companies believe such information can be published without putting national security at risk			0
@entity55 said the companies " remain concerned with the government 's continued unwillingness to permit us to publish sufficient data relating to @entity44 orders ... we believe we have a clear right under the @entity83 to share more information with the public			0
the purpose of our litigation is to uphold this right so that we can disclose additional data			0
" @entity90 misrepresented scope of data collection to secret court the government opposes releasing how many requests it makes to each company			1
it hopes that the solution it will propose friday -- releasing statistics on request types in the aggregate , but not company by company -- will suffice			2
director of national intelligence @entity104 said thursday that the government would seek to declassify broader statistics			0
" our ability to discuss these activities is limited by our need to protect intelligence sources and methods , " he said			0
" @entity44 and national security letters are an important part of our effort to keep the nation and its citizens safe , and disclosing more detailed information about how they are used and to whom they are directed can obviously help our enemies avoid detection " the surveillance programs were brought to public light through leaks to media outlets by former @entity90 contractor @entity129 , who fled the @entity2 and is now in @entity131 under temporary asylum			2
opinion : your smartphone is hackers ' next big target @entity0 @entity140 contributed to this report .			0
