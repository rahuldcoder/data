@entity1 leaders warned friday that reports of widespread spying on world leaders by the @entity5 have raised " deep concerns " among @entity1 and could affect the cooperation needed for effective intelligence gathering			2
" a lack of trust could prejudice the necessary cooperation in the field , " the leaders said in a joint statement issued at the conclusion of a two - day @entity13 summit in @entity14 , @entity15			2
@entity21 prime minister @entity20 announced that @entity22 has summoned @entity24 ambassador @entity23 over the matter			1
the @entity24 @entity26 in @entity22 declined to comment , saying that @entity20 's statement stands for itself			1
@entity29 chancellor @entity28 said the assertions that the @entity5 spied on her and other world leaders had " severely shaken " relationships between @entity1 and the @entity24 , and trust will have to be rebuilt			1
@entity29 's @entity28 : relations with @entity24 ' severely shaken ' " obviously , words will not be sufficient , " @entity28 told reporters thursday in @entity14			1
" true change is necessary			0
" @entity29 and @entity40 intend to seek talks with the @entity24 " with the aim of finding before the end of the year an understanding on mutual relations in that field , " the @entity13 leaders ' statement said			1
other nations are welcome to join these talks , it noted			2
@entity40 president @entity50 , speaking in @entity14 , said the aim of the talks would be to establish a joint cooperation framework with the @entity24 " so we put an end to these practices and ... these monitoring schemes			1
" @entity50 said there is an " ongoing dialog " with the @entity24 over its past actions , but the priority is establishing a " code of conduct " for the present and future			1
this is essential because @entity40 and its @entity1 allies " can not accept " the kind of monitoring which has gone on , whose purpose " is not just political -- it is mainly an economic issue , " @entity50 said			1
" it is relevant to the markets , to the prices , to the mergers and acquisitions			0
this is where the monitoring may have the highest impact -- on jobs in particular , " he said			0
the main purpose of intelligence efforts is tackling terrorism and ensuring security , he said , but no one should have to fear their personal data being used			0
meanwhile , @entity28 is under pressure to take a strong stance back home , where her conservative party is in negotiations with the @entity93 , known as the @entity93 , to form a grand coalition government			1
in remarks quoted friday by the @entity29 newspaper @entity97 , @entity93 chief @entity95 criticized the outgoing government 's handling of spying allegations made this summer			1
" of course , it is outrageous that an @entity24 secret service would tap the chancellor 's cell phone , " @entity95 said			2
" i recall quite well , though , that some politicians and , by the way , the media , too , declared the @entity5 affair as over and done with			0
we can not repeat that error			0
" @entity95 said the @entity93 would " vehemently push in the coalition talks for the effective protection , not only of the chancellor 's privacy , but just as hard for that of 82 million other citizens in @entity29			1
" it 's about more than just a bugging scandal with the chancellor			2
it 's about freedom and civil rights in the digital age			0
" at the summit , @entity13 leaders discussed data protection and privacy			0
' lack of trust ' @entity28 raised the surveillance issue in a phone call with @entity24 president @entity131 on wednesday after the @entity29 government said it had information that the @entity24 might have monitored her cell phone			1
on thursday , @entity136 spokesman @entity135 repeated what he had said wednesday -- that @entity131 assured @entity28 that the @entity24 is not monitoring and will not monitor her communications			1
he did not say anything about possible past monitoring			0
the @entity29 spying allegation came in the same week that the @entity40 daily newspaper @entity142 reported claims that the @entity5 intercepted more than 70 million phone calls in @entity40 over a 30 - day period			1
@entity97 reported in june that leaks from government contractor - turned - whistleblower @entity146 detailed how the agency bugged @entity13 offices in @entity150 and @entity151 , and conducted an " electronic eavesdropping operation " that tapped into an @entity13 building in @entity14			0
@entity28 spoke with @entity131 by phone in july about allegations that the @entity24 was conducting surveillance on its @entity1 allies			1
the @entity159 newspaper -- citing a document obtained from @entity146 -- reported thursday that the @entity5 monitored phone conversations of 35 world leaders			0
the confidential memo is from 2006 , prior to @entity131 's election as president			0
none of the world leaders is identified			0
their phone numbers were among 200 handed over to the @entity5 by a @entity24 official , the memo states			2
it says that the @entity5 encouraged " senior officials in its ' customer ' departments , such as the @entity136 , @entity174 and the @entity175 , to share their ' rolodexes ' so the agency can add the phone numbers of leading foreign politicians to their surveillance systems , " even though tracking until then had yielded " little reportable intelligence , " the @entity159 reported			0
' @entity182 challenges ' in a @entity186 op - ed published online thursday night , @entity131 's homeland security and counterterrorism adviser @entity183 conceded that recent " disclosures have created significant challenges in our relationships			0
" to address them , the president has ordered a " review ( of ) our surveillance capabilities , including with our foreign partners , " she wrote			0
" we want to ensure we are collecting information because we need it and not because we can , " said @entity183			0
@entity197 , a professor of political science at the @entity199 , said this is " an important piece of evidence that our technological capabilities have far outstripped our thinking about how we should use those capabilities to best advance @entity24 national security			2
" while the allegations of @entity24 spying on world leaders will soon drop out of the headlines , @entity197 said , " the larger problem of the disconnect between our capabilities and our thinking about how to use them ( will ) remain for years to come			1
" he added the diplomatic fallout resulting from the controversy " should encourage @entity24 leaders to ask , even if we have the technical capability to target these leaders , whether it is in our interest to do so			2
