@entity0 -- @entity2 is talking tough about @entity3 these days , for reasons both pragmatic and political			1
the overwhelming favorite for the @entity7 presidential nomination in 2016 , if she decides to run , @entity8 already faces @entity10 criticism for allegedly being soft on @entity11 as president @entity13 's secretary of state until last year			1
a recent @entity15 statement mocked the " reset " button she offered to @entity3 foreign minister @entity18 in 2009 in what was a symbolic effort by the @entity13 administration to move past @entity3 's military backing for two breakaway regions in @entity23			1
now @entity3 's attempted annexation of the @entity25 from neighboring @entity26 , another former @entity27 territory , has again put @entity0 - @entity11 relations in the spotlight			1
using generally stronger and more provocative language than the administration she once represented , @entity8 seeks to buff her own foreign policy credentials and those of her party without straying too far from the official government messaging and tactics			2
" she has to walk a very fine line " " she has to walk a very fine line , " @entity41 political scientist @entity40 said of the former first lady and @entity44 senator			0
the goal is to maintain her credibility as a former secretary of state , and the @entity7 's credibility on security and defense issues , as the nation heads toward congressional elections in november and the presidential vote two years later , @entity40 told @entity1			2
" she sees it as important not just for her but for the @entity7 as a whole , " @entity40 said			0
otherwise , " you go from the party that killed @entity60 to the party that ca n't stop @entity62			0
" @entity2 : it 's up to @entity62 whether there 's ' another @entity65 ' on tuesday , @entity8 used a speech in @entity67 to describe the conflict between @entity3 and @entity70 allies over @entity25 as a " clash of values , " adding that @entity62 would determine if another @entity65 ensued			1
" i hope there is not another @entity65 , " @entity8 said in response to a question			0
" obviously , nobody wants to see that			0
i think that is primarily up to @entity62			0
" she also called the @entity25 situation an effort by @entity62 to " rewrite the boundaries of @entity83			1
" " if he is allowed to get away with that , i think you will see a lot of other countries either directly facing @entity3 aggression or suborned with their political system so that they are so intimidated that in effect they are transformed into vassals , not sovereign democracies , " @entity8 warned			2
" there is a lot at stake here			0
" much at stake she called on the @entity13 administration to " do a better job of supporting " the interim @entity26 government , and pushed for easing @entity83 's energy dependence on @entity3 , saying : " the @entity3 can only intimidate you if you are dependent on them			2
" earlier this month , @entity8 compared @entity62 's actions in @entity25 to the tactics of @entity110 in the 1930s , when @entity112 began taking over neighboring countries			1
that remark drew media attention and some criticism , with @entity8 clarifying her point the next day			0
@entity13 and secretary of state @entity119 also have criticized @entity62 , using careful language to insist that @entity3 's moves in @entity25 violated international law and would never gain international acceptance			1
@entity124 slams @entity13 , @entity8 for foreign policy ' failure ' vice president @entity127 , meanwhile , has played the role of administration attack dog by traveling to @entity130 , @entity131 and @entity132 this week to label the @entity3 move in @entity25 a " land grab " and pledge @entity135 support for former @entity27 satellites now part of the alliance			1
@entity127 has hinted he might run for the @entity7 presidential nomination in 2016 , and @entity40 said @entity8 's public posture on the @entity26 crisis takes a possible @entity127 challenge into consideration			1
@entity127 on her mind " on the off chance @entity127 decides he wants to run , she 's taking every opportunity to one - up him on foreign policy credentials , " @entity40 said			0
at the same time , @entity8 wants to avoid launching any kind of " real challenge " to @entity13 on the issue , she added , saying " you look like a turncoat and it reduces your credibility			0
" at the @entity158 , spokesman @entity157 rejected any political calculations in the @entity44 response to @entity62 and @entity3 when asked about @entity15 claims the issue could hurt @entity8 in 2016			1
" that 's a superficial way of looking at things , " @entity157 said , adding that " our obligation is to be very clear - eyed about what our national security interests are , what our obligations are to our allies and partners , and to pursue those			0
" noting a " temptation to see everything through the lens of the next election cycle , " @entity157 said " that 's pretty flaccid thinking			0
" @entity2 must once again win over some in @entity181 community @entity1 's @entity182 contributed to this report .			2
