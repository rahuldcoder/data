-- @entity1 has been fined $ 75,000 by the @entity2 for three safety violations , including one classified as willful , after an animal trainer was killed in february			1
in a statement monday , @entity5 , @entity2 's regional administrator , said that @entity1 knew of the inherent risks of allowing trainers to interact with dangerous animals			1
" nonetheless , it required its employees to work within the pool walls , on ledges and on shelves where they were subject to dangerous behavior by the animals , " @entity5 said in the statement			0
@entity1 denied what it called " unfounded " allegations by the @entity20 @entity22 agency and said it would contest the citations			1
" @entity2 's allegations in this citation are unsupported by any evidence or precedent and reflect a fundamental lack of understanding of the safety requirements associated with marine mammal care penalties , " a @entity1 statement said monday			1
in february , a 12,000 - pound killer whale at the @entity34 , @entity35 , @entity1 pulled trainer @entity36 , 40 , underwater and killed her as horrified park visitors watched			1
an autopsy report showed @entity36 died from drowning and traumatic injuries to her body , including her spine , ribs and head			0
the @entity2 statement said the whale involved was one of three also involved in the death of an animal trainer in 1991 at a @entity52 , @entity53 , water park			1
the agency 's investigation " revealed that @entity1 trainers had an extensive history of unexpected and potentially dangerous incidents involving killer whales at its various facilities , including its location in @entity34 , " the @entity2 statement said			1
" despite this record , management failed to make meaningful changes to improve the safety of the work environment for its employees			0
" @entity2 issued one " willful " citation -- defined as a violation committed with plain indifference or intentional disregard for employee safety health -- for " exposing its employees to hazards when interacting with killer whales , " the statement said			2
a second citation classified as " serious " was issued for failing to install a stairway railing system on one side of a stadium stage , the @entity2 statement said , adding that such a violation is when " death or serious physical harm is likely to result from a hazard about which the employer knew or should have known			2
" a third citation considered less serious involved a failure to put weatherproof enclosures over outdoor electrical receptacles , the statement said			0
in response , the @entity1 statement said its internal review reached a different conclusion			0
without providing details , the statement said the conclusions were " drawn from decades of experience caring for marine mammals			0
" " the safety of @entity1 's killer whale program was already a model for marine zoological facilities around the world and the changes we are now undertaking in personal safety , facility design and communication will make the display of killer whales at @entity1 parks safer still , " the @entity1 statement said			2
it noted that killer whales at @entity1 " are displayed under valid federal permits and under the supervision of two government agencies with directly applicable expertise : the @entity20 @entity116 and the @entity20 @entity117			2
" the @entity1 statement also said its trainers were " among the most skilled , trained and committed zoological professionals in the world today			0
" " the fact that there have been so few incidents over more than 2 million separate interactions with killer whales is evidence not just of @entity1 's commitment to safety , but to the success of that training and the skill and professionalism of our staff , " the @entity1 statement said .			0
