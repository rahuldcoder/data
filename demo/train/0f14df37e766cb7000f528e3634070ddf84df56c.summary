-- pope @entity1 on monday said he plans on resigning the papal office on february 28			1
the following is the full text of @entity1 's declaration : @entity6 , i have convoked you to this consistory , not only for the three canonizations , but also to communicate to you a decision of great importance for the life of the @entity14			0
after having repeatedly examined my conscience before @entity16 , i have come to the certainty that my strengths , due to an advanced age , are no longer suited to an adequate exercise of the @entity22 ministry			1
i am well aware that this ministry , due to its essential spiritual nature , must be carried out not only with words and deeds , but no less with prayer and suffering			0
papal resignation : what happens next ? however , in today 's world , subject to so many rapid changes and shaken by questions of deep relevance for the life of faith , in order to govern the bark of @entity22 and proclaim the @entity42 , both strength of mind and body are necessary , strength which in the last few months , has deteriorated in me to the extent that i have had to recognize my incapacity to adequately fulfill the ministry entrusted to me			1
for this reason , and well aware of the seriousness of this act , with full freedom i declare that i renounce the ministry of @entity53 , @entity54 , entrusted to me by the @entity55 on 19 april 2005 , in such a way , that as from 28 february 2013 , at 20:00 hours , the @entity57 , the @entity58 , will be vacant and a conclave to elect the new @entity53 will have to be convoked by those whose competence it is			1
sorrow and surprise as @entity1 steps down @entity6 , i thank you most sincerely for all the love and work with which you have supported me in my ministry and i ask pardon for all my defects			2
and now , let us entrust the @entity72 to the care of @entity74 , our lord @entity75 , and implore his holy @entity76 , so that she may assist the @entity79 with her maternal solicitude , in electing a new @entity53			0
with regard to myself , i wish to also devotedly serve the @entity14 in the future through a life dedicated to prayer			0
from the @entity57 , 10 february 2013 @entity1			2
