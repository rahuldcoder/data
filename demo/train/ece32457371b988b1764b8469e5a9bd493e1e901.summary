@entity1 , @entity0 -- the way professional golf is played may have changed for good after the @entity6 @entity5 decided to go along with a new rule that amounts to a rollback of golf technology , a move that world number one @entity11 has endorsed			1
@entity11 supports a rule change that will make it harder to play out of the rough			1
the rule , implemented by the @entity16 ( @entity16 ) and @entity17 ( @entity18 ) , means that from the start of 2010 the @entity20 grooves on wedges will be banned in favor of v - shaped grooves , with the intention of rewarding accurate driving over distance hitting			2
research by the @entity16 has shown that @entity20 grooves allow top players to generate much more spin when playing the ball out of the rough , making the ball come to a quick stop on the green			1
the @entity16 and @entity18 felt this meant that landing in the rough was no longer enough of a penalty for shots that strayed from the fairway			2
in recent years pro golfers have begun to drive for distance rather than accuracy , knowing they can spin their way out of the rough if they miss their target -- a style of play known as " bomb and gouge			1
" despite pressure from some players and golf equipment manufacturers , the @entity6 @entity5 has decided to go along with the rule change , meaning @entity6 @entity5 competitions , including the @entity55 , will feature the club restriction from next year			1
amateur competitions will not ditch the @entity20 grooves until 2014 and the new rule will not apply to recreational players until 2024			2
@entity60 , product manager at leading golf club manufacturer @entity61 , told @entity2 he believes the change will reward more skilful players			1
" at the moment players are getting a lot of spin on the ball so i think it will make people play better , " he said			2
" they 'll have to get their technique finely tuned and not rely on the club			0
" he says club makers have been given ample notice to prepare for the switch			0
" i do n't think the change is a regression , it just means research and development will have to come up with better ideas to help the players out			0
" @entity60 explained that as a golfer strikes the ball the grooves on the club face catch the coating on the ball 's surface , producing back spin			0
he said that the rule change applies to five irons and up and requires the grooves on the club face to be more spaced out , which will make it harder for the grooves to catch the ball			1
@entity11 has supported the changes , saying : " i think it 's great			0
we 've had plenty of time to make our adjustments			0
all the companies have been testing and getting ready for this			0
" to compensate for the loss of spin from the rough , tour players may use softer balls , which spin more but do not travel as far			1
that could favor players who already use the softer ball -- including @entity11 .			0

the @entity5 has *agreed* to a rule that will ban @entity116 clubs for tour players
the rule should reward accuracy by making it harder to play from the rough
golf club *designers* are researching new technologies to *replace* the *u-groove*
