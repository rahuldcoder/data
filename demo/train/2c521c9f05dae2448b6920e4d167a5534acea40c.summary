is the most common neurobehavioral disorder among children , and as incidence of the condition continue to rise , parents and patients are asking what happens next			0
how does @entity1 affect children as they become teens and adults and start to form relationships , find jobs and establish families of their own ? does the condition put them at a disadvantage for coping with life 's inevitable challenges ? with 5.4 million children ever diagnosed with @entity1 in the @entity22 , and 3 % to 7 % of school - aged children currently struggling with the condition , it 's worth considering how @entity1 affects their adult lives			1
@entity0 : why youngest kids in class most likely to be diagnosed @entity28 of the @entity29 at @entity30 and her colleagues studied the potentially long - term effects of @entity1 among men who were diagnosed as kids			1
in their 33 - year follow - up study , @entity35 and her team looked at 135 middle - aged men with childhood @entity1 who were referred to the study by their teachers when they were between six to 12 years old			1
the researchers compared this group to 136 men without adhd and found that men with @entity1 struggled more in occupational , educational , economic and social arenas later in life compared to men without the diagnosis			2
@entity0 : new definition may make adhd easier to spot in adults at the 33 - year follow - up , when the men were in their forties , those with childhood - diagnosed @entity1 without conduct disorders had about 2.5 years fewer years of education compared to the other men ; only 3.7 % had higher degrees compared to nearly 30 % of the control group			1
the majority ( 84 % ) were holding jobs , but at significantly lower positions than peers without adhd and were therefore at a financial disadvantage			0
on average , the researchers say , the adhd group earned $ 40,000 less in salary than their unaffected counterparts			0
socially , men with @entity1 also struggled with higher divorce rates , more antisocial personality disorders and substance abuse			1
on the positive side , however , they did not have higher rates of mood and anxiety disorders , like depression			2
@entity0 : 25 % of adults who seek treatment do n't have adhd overall , the adhd adults showed higher rates of psychiatric hospitalizations and incarcerations , which the authors conclude supports a continued need for monitoring and treatment of kids with @entity1 , even when a conduct disorder is not present			1
dr. @entity35 says even when children with @entity1 are not disruptive , they may still be at a higher risk for developing antisocial behaviors later on , like lying , stealing and cheating			1
but addressing the needs of children with @entity1 , by providing academic support in school to help them overcome their frustrations and challenges in paying attention and retaining what they learn , and by giving them emotional support from the family , can given these students the coping skills they need to meet their adult challenges â € ” in the workplace , in relationships and in social interactions â € ” as well			2
" one of the very important messages [ from our findings ] is that most kids [ with @entity1 ] do ok , and some do very well			0
as a group they did well , " says @entity35			0
while @entity1 's effect can linger into adulthood , it does n't have to be either debilitating or inevitable			0
" it does affect their lives , but not to the point that they 're very badly off , " she says			0
