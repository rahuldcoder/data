-- hours before being honored for his peacemaking efforts , @entity1 revealed a secret weapon : @entity4			1
the former @entity8 president was constantly on the phone with @entity1 during the @entity11 peace process in 1998 , providing analysis and advice that proved crucial to reaching an agreement , the former @entity6 prime minister said monday			1
" he played an absolutely critical role , " @entity1 said of @entity4 on monday as the two sat side - by - side to answer questions before the evening ceremony where @entity1 was to receive the @entity19 from the @entity20 in @entity21 , @entity22			1
" without your intervention , we would never have achieved that peace in @entity11 , " @entity1 said to @entity4 , adding that he never had the chance to publicly thank him			1
@entity4 and @entity1 sign autographs at event the hour - long session featured anecdotes and rare insight on historical developments of the 1990s , when @entity4 was @entity8 president and @entity1 became the @entity6 prime minister			1
the @entity19 , an annual award given by the nonprofit constitution center that has @entity4 as its board chairman , went to @entity1 this year for " his steadfast commitment to conflict resolution , " the group 's website says			1
along with the @entity11 peace agreement he helped mediate , @entity1 was cited for his role in @entity46 peace negotiations and the work of his @entity48 in promoting global understanding			0
asked about the necessary components for successful peace talks , @entity1 joked that " blind luck " was essential			0
he then listed the willingness of the participants , a framework agreement on basic principles and perseverance as the key factors			0
no matter how difficult it is , no matter how hard it is , just keep going , " @entity1 said as @entity4 nodded in agreement			1
in the @entity11 talks , @entity1 said , the acute focus on the negotiations created an expectation that helped force participants to reach an agreement			0
" it was , in a sense , luck that we got into such a hothouse atmosphere that people began to feel it was more embarrassing not to do the deal than to do it , " @entity1 said			0
@entity4 added that it was important for outside parties to help warring nations or factions realize the benefits and future possibilities of peace			1
" we 've got to paint a picture of what this is like at the end of the road , and we have to be there to help maximize the benefits and minimize the risks , " @entity4 said			1
on several occasions , @entity1 mentioned particular advice or help he received from @entity4 , such as strong @entity8 support for @entity93 intervention in the @entity95 conflict to stop forced removals and killings of @entity98 by @entity100 forces			1
" the truth is , without @entity8 and without president @entity4 coming in , we could n't have handled that , " @entity1 said			2
such backing reflected the longstanding " special " relationship between their countries , and @entity1 insisted that the shifting global dynamics of the 21st century made that partnership more vital than ever			0
he called the relationship " something living and breathing now , with relevance today and tomorrow , and we should keep it			0
" to @entity4 , the shifting role of the two industrial powers made their relationship important for everyone			2
" on balance , it 's been a good thing for the world because we 're not imperialists anymore and whatever we do , we do partly because we have a capacity most other countries do n't , " he said			0
both men listed the economic rise of @entity127 as a major current issue , and @entity1 also mentioned the growing role of religious extremism			0
" it 's there , and it 's powerful and it 's not , i 'm afraid , going away , " he said			0
for his part , @entity4 said , a changing dynamic in the @entity137 world made a @entity46 peace agreement more possible now than 10 years ago , when he was president			2
back then , he said , @entity137 leaders privately encouraged him to seek an @entity142 - @entity141 peace agreement but were unable to publicly endorse a proposed deal for political reasons			2
now , he said , the @entity137 world fears the rise of @entity146 as a regional power and threat , and therefore seeks a sustainable relationship with the @entity8 and @entity142			0
" the most hopeful thing is that the @entity137 want this done , " @entity4 said of renewed peace talks guided by his wife , secretary of state @entity151 .			2
