" he is now in @entity31 " until we figure out what to do next			0
" @entity8 is a fellow at @entity34 and the @entity35 , a @entity2 - based think tank			2
he has written extensively on the history of @entity0 in the post-soviet era			2
in a prepared statement , the @entity38 accused @entity8 of violating entry visa regulations			1
it said that after entering @entity0 on november 21 , he waited five days before converting his initial visa into a multi-entry visa -- a " major breach of the @entity0 migration law			1
" after receiving his accreditation from the ministry , @entity8 was supposed to immediately go to the @entity48 to get his multi-entry visa , but he showed up there on november 26 , the statement said			1
@entity8 spent about five days in @entity0 " illegally " in november , according to the ministry			1
a @entity9 court heard his case on november 29 , and he was fined and ordered to leave the country , the ministry said			0

" " i 've always been critical of the @entity4 regime			0
this is nothing new , " he said			0
" it may be that for reasons of their own , they 've finally found that criticism to be more than they wanted to put up with			0
but there 's actually quite a lot to criticize , so if you 're going to report honestly from @entity0 , you almost have to be critical			2
" @entity8 said the language used to reject his visa hearkened back to the @entity7 era and its application to a journalist was " unprecedented			2
" but whether it reflected a shift in policy toward international newsgathering was unclear , he said			0
