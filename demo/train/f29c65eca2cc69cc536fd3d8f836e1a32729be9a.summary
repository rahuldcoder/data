-- @entity1 has dominated @entity2 for the past three years and looks set to win a fourth straight drivers ' championship -- but that could all change in 2014 when the winds of change are unleashed on the sport			1
@entity1 's @entity9 has been the standout car , with the @entity11 consistently faster than his rivals at @entity13 , @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
however , @entity16 's sporting director @entity17 says the introduction of new technical regulations next season means a new order may emerge in the world of @entity2			1
cars currently use 2.4 - liter engines but they will be forced to bring in 1.6 - liter turbocharged @entity25 engines next year , while there are also changes to aerodynamics and energy systems			0
" when you get a big rule change the engineering structures are not fast enough to respond , even if you 're given two or three years to design cars for 2014 , " @entity17 told @entity2 's official website			1
" although we 're a world away from where we were 20 years ago in terms of preparation -- ultimately until you get out there and run properly you 're not going to have as much reliability as you do on the current cars			0
" so do i think it will mix things up ? probably			0
there 'll be different results that would n't occur like they do now			0
it 's just another thing that 's part of rule changes and it 's something that you have to cope with			2
" @entity1 has won seven races so far this season and sits well clear at the top of the drivers ' championship , with nearest challenger @entity56 of @entity13 60 points adrift			1
but @entity17 believes next season could be a far closer affair			1
he says the introduction of a new powertrain will give teams early reliability problems , while narrow front wings , a reduction in nose height and prohibiting of exhaust blowing will also cause trouble for mechanics			2
" when you have such a big change to the powertrain from a mechanical side , you will build in more margin than what you would have done previously , " he added			0
" let 's say we had n't made any changes to the powertrain for next year ; what you 'd be doing is taking an extremely well - known product and chipping away at marginal gains -- a little bit of weight here , a bit of friction there , maybe a change in packaging			0
" that 's all gone out of the window for 2014 and you 'll be in one of two positions -- either you 've pushed it too far and you 'll be unreliable , or you 'll be too heavy and you 'll want to take some weight out of the car			2
" both of those things take time			0
you wo n't have got it bang on in all areas of the car , so everyone will be in the same game			0
" the slope that you get on when you have such big rule change is very steep compared to normal , so i think the development race -- trying to claw back as much downforce as you can -- will be a significant part of the 2014 season			1

@entity2 will introduce a whole host of new regulations for 2014 season
@entity9 's @entity1 is poised to win a fourth consecutive drivers ' title
@entity16 believes changes in rules means teams will face *adaptation* problems
