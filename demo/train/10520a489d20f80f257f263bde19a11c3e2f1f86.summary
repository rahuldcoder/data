november is the month we celebrate @entity2 in the @entity3			2
in @entity5 , there is a different type of celebration			1
it turns out that all tax returns of every @entity10 are made public this month , which leads to a " media frenzy of gossip , boasting and finger - pointing about who has paid their fair share in income tax , " according to an article on @entity17			1
good times for all , it would seem , in the small @entity21 country widely praised for its generous social welfare policies			0
well , not quite for all			0
take banker @entity24 , one of the richest @entity5			1
he moved to @entity25 of all places earlier this year to avoid the high tax rates in his homeland			2
the average income tax rate in @entity5 fell from 37.5 % in the 1990s to around 30 % in the 2000s , and is now rising , set to hit 31.1 % next year			1
in the @entity3 in contrast , the average tax rate in 2010 was 11.81 % , according to a study published by the non-partisan @entity35			2
another study shows that in 2014 , 95 % of @entity3 paid an effective income tax rate under 10 % ; the top 1 % of income earners reached an average of 24.6 % , still significantly below the average tax rate for all taxpaying @entity5			1
so what would happen if @entity3 had a " @entity43 " like @entity5 , and tax returns of every citizen were all released in one fell swoop to unleash a media frenzy ? it is hard to predict counter-factual history , of course , beyond stating the obvious -- it ai n't going to happen , ever			1
even the most zealous foes of privacy when it comes to terrorists and other outcasts seem firmly committed to privacy of tax returns			1
do n't tread on me -- and do n't look at my 1040 -- seem equally sacred principles in the @entity3			0
but putting reality aside for a moment , what is my best guess as to what would happen if @entity3 went the @entity5 way ? nothing			2
nothing has been happening a lot lately			0
according to the online @entity69 , the saying that " the more things change , the more they stay the same " is a proverb " making the observation that turbulent changes do not affect reality on a deeper level other than to cement the status quo			0
" we certainly have seen a lot of turbulent changes			0
consider the situation in 2008 : the @entity3 was facing a @entity86 , a worldwide credit crisis exacerbated by sketchy lending policies , not to mention two major wars ( @entity89 and @entity90 ) , each part of a broader war against terrorism , sovereign debt crises around the globe ( @entity81 , @entity82 , more ) and mounting fiscal deficits at home			1
the turbulence led to the election of @entity96 , our first @entity97 - @entity3 president , a @entity98 , and something of a liberal to boot			0
so what happened to tax policy , which might be thought to play a starring role as both cause and effect of the drama ? well , pretty much , nothing			1
it was not until the early hours of 2013 that we saw any changes to the income tax at all , and these were mainly to add a few percentage points to the rate bracket in which a handful of the highest earners found themselves -- those couples earning more than $ 450,000 a year			2
earlier this year , the @entity121 economist @entity120 saw his monumental work " @entity123 " translated into @entity124 and promptly rocket up all kinds of bestseller lists			0
@entity120 's volume tells the tale of how the @entity3 , in particular , is approaching the highest levels of wealth and income inequality in recorded history			1
and what has been the policy response to @entity120 's prognosis ? well , again , nothing , unless you consider a return to a @entity141 @entity140 , and a fully divided government , something			2
( in fact , that is the ideal structure in which nothing gets done , hence it makes stock markets happy			0
) then there is the fact that when we do disclose tax returns in the @entity3 , nothing much happens			1
presidential candidates tend to do this			0
when they do not , or just release summaries , nothing much happens			0
from the disclosures , we learn that @entity159 was not very wealthy , but @entity160 is , and life pretty much goes on -- with some wailing and gnashing of teeth among tax cognoscenti over such odd tidbits as the fact that @entity160 was able to amass more than $ 100 million in a @entity168			2
the tax policy impact ? well , nothing			1
there was also the much ballyhooed self - disclosure of @entity174 's 2010 tax returns , leading to a proposal for a " @entity176 , " a flat 30 % effective tax rate on millionaires -- still lower than the average @entity5 tax rate			1
what happened there ? well , nothing , again			0
so , how about it ? could we force all tax returns in the @entity3 to be made public so that we could have a " media frenzy of gossip , boasting and finger - pointing " too ? well , no and no. no , it ai n't going to happen and no , it would not lead to that result			1
not here , not now			0
no doubt , tax compliance might improve , by means of shame if nothing else , and perhaps some entrepreneurs would even find a way to make some money by " whistleblowing " on tax crimes and misdemeanors they unearthed from the massive data dump			2
yet being @entity3 , publicly disclosed tax returns would more likely lead to an assault from financial advisors offering their services to help the rich lower their taxes			1
just think -- who would not want a $ 100 million @entity168 ? taxes could thus even go down , as the tax - avoidance - industry found new targets , with fees to these helpful souls going up			0
@entity215 in 21st century @entity3 are different than those in @entity5 , a nation with a population about the size of @entity219			2
we have gotten pretty much inured to indifference about levels of wealth and income inequality unimaginable to people from other times and places			1
the details simply bore us			0
our media frenzies and gossip are about other pressing matters			0
in fact , i have to run ; i have to find out just what 's going on with @entity234 and @entity235 , and i have yet to see the latest @entity237 photos			0

in november , all tax returns of every citizen are made public in @entity5 on " @entity43 "
@entity243 : even most zealous foes of privacy are committed to privacy of tax returns
he says despite the @entity86 and financial crisis , our tax *system* is *unchanged*
@entity243 : even with income inequality at unimaginable levels , there 's no impact on tax policy
