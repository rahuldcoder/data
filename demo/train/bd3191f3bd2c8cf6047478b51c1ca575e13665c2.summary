" today , with the leadership of @entity6 , we opened our doors again today and welcomed back our employees			0
" @entity6 said the state stepped in not just for economic reasons , but also for symbolic reasons			0

tourists were happy to hear the announcement of the reopening and began lining up to visit the @entity89 landmark			2
" we would have been disappointed			0
we probably would have taken the @entity90 or a @entity91 to at least go near the island to get a picture , but i 've done that before , and it 's just so much better to be on the island			0
it 's a really neat experience , " said @entity96 , who was visiting @entity89			0
