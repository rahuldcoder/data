the low pressure systems sweeping in off the @entity23 have had surfers chasing the so - called " @entity25 , " with world class athletes travelling to the west coast of @entity28 to ride the waves blooming off the famous @entity31 reef in @entity32			1
@entity11 @entity33 packed his bags and hopped on a jet from @entity36 to join some of @entity8 's top surfers , including @entity38 and @entity39 , for a once in a lifetime chance to master the big @entity31 swell			1
