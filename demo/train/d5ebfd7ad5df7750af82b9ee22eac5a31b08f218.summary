@entity0 , @entity1 -- to bolster its digital currency , @entity4 is deepening ties with digital purchasing provider @entity7 , the two companies said at an event tuesday			1
after a flurry of partnerships announced at the @entity15 conference , the @entity11 's linchpin payment platform said it will provide a new option for buying inexpensive virtual goods from the largest social network			1
@entity4 currently allows its users to buy @entity20 , the site 's proprietary currency , with a @entity7 account			1
@entity4 will add the ability to buy virtual items individually , rather than in increments of $ 15 , thanks to @entity7 's new digital goods platform , which was unveiled at the conference			1
credits are used to purchase virtual gifts for friends or power - ups in games			0
developers making @entity4 applications powered by credits -- such as the @entity37 , which makes @entity38 -- will soon have the option of receiving payments through deposits to their @entity7 accounts			1
" the gaming industry is often an indicator of what 's to come , " @entity4 chief operating officer @entity43 said during the announcement			1
" more people play games on @entity4 than on the top three consoles combined			2
" these features will roll out in the next several months , said @entity52 , @entity7 's vice president of product development			2
" @entity7 is already one of the main ways to buy @entity20 , " @entity43 said			1
" @entity7 took the pain out of transactions			2
" @entity4 also accepts credit cards and payments via cell phone from some wireless carriers			2
gift cards containing @entity20 can be found at stores such as @entity63 , @entity64 and @entity65			0
although @entity7 had a partnership in place with @entity4 in february , @entity7 president @entity66 said these new features are a step toward expansions between the two companies			1
" today 's announcement was a refinement of our product , " he said			0
for @entity4 , the @entity20 product may also need refinement			1
@entity43 took a moment during her announcement to poll the sizable audience about whether they had purchased @entity20			0
few people raised their hands			0
" try it ! " @entity43 urged the audience			0
" you 'll like it			0
" @entity4 has drawn a million developers to make software and widgets that run within or connect with the social network , @entity43 said			0
" the games and stuff that have happened on this platform are just amazing , " @entity4 chief @entity93 said last week during a panel at his company 's headquarters in @entity97 , @entity1			2
" five years out , i think the world is going to look a lot more like @entity37			0
" but @entity4 's platform is n't quite mature			1
that could have something to do with a flimsy relationship with developers , @entity7 's @entity104 said			2
" @entity4 has done a really good job building out their platform , but one area where they have n't really done a good job is paying developers , " said @entity104 , who is senior director of @entity7 's developer network			1
" and that 's where this partnership comes in			0
" @entity7 announced a number of other agreements , including new ways to use the service to buy things within smartphone apps ; using that phone in lieu of a credit card at a few stores in @entity0 ; and buying memorabilia using software made for televisions			0
next year , @entity7 will launch an app marketplace to showcase websites and products that tie into its services .			0
