-- attention all who drool over head - turning , rubber - burning cars : here 's your candy store			1
this weekend the world famous @entity6 hosts two days of races between hundreds of vintage vehicles spanning the past 100 years			1
they 're billing the @entity11 as the " largest gathering of race cars in the @entity14			1
" @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			0
ever heard of these guys ? they 're @entity21 500 winners			1
they 'll be there -- on the track and behind the wheel			2
the whole weekend threatens to be a 100 - mph - plus parade of eye - popping race cars that would quite literally blow your hair back			1
but let 's be frank : this is a celebration of a time when race cars were , well , a helluva lot more interesting to look at			1
right ? if you 've never seen the lines of @entity39 's @entity38 - winning " @entity37 , do yourself a favor			2
same with @entity17 ' 1963 winning car " @entity46 , " which took the checkered flag as it crossed @entity38 's brick start / finish line			1
@entity48 's awesome side - pipe and its snazzy front - end air scoops			2
both cars are expected to come out to play this weekend			2
related : @entity51 wins @entity21 the 1960s , ' 70s and ' 80s offered a smorgasbord of car designs born from mechanical grit			1
@entity15 , a two - time @entity21 winner , plans to get behind the wheel of a 1969 @entity59 this weekend and " open it up all i can , " he said			1
" i 'm gon na drive it as fast as it 'll go			0
" these are cars that were truly unique			2
some cars were shaped like wedges , some like tubes			2
compare them to today 's designs -- both @entity38 and @entity74			1
nowadays there 's a lot of what @entity77 calls , " sameness			2
" " there 's not just a hunger -- there 's almost a starvation for design now among auto racing fans , " says @entity80 , of the @entity81			2
" they loved looking at the variety of cars , and this event is going to provide that in spades			0
" the weekend is sponsored by the association -- a race car restoration and preservation group dedicated to " rolling art. " " some people collect art , " their website says			1
" in addition to the open - wheel indy racers , the event plans to showcase @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 from the ' 60s and ' 70s			0
also invited : cars made by @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 related : art museum features dream concept cars related : @entity116 drives in two races on same day while car designs have remained much the same , other aspects of the @entity6 have been shifting gears during the past 20 years			1
the hallowed facility has embraced new ideas like no other time in its history			0
" it 's changed a lot , " says @entity6 historian @entity125 , who 's been a part of the @entity21 since the mid- 1960s			1
take for example , the @entity130 -- known during the 1970s as a scandalous den of race - fan debauchery located in the infield			0
it made headlines in 1974 when dozens of naked race fans climbed the fence and " streaked " down @entity138			0
after that , officials " very subtly phased the @entity130 out , " @entity125 recalls			0
five years ago , the speedway opened a safer , sanctioned , " new - school " @entity130 inside @entity142 , complete with international djs , dancing , food trucks and volleyball			0
this weekend , overnight camping in the infield will be available for the first time , according to the speedway 's video			1
related : @entity153 races its classic cars privately owned by @entity157 's @entity156 for nearly 70 years , the track executed an ambitious plan in the ' 90s to embrace other forms of auto racing , including @entity162 and @entity74			1
@entity38 's @entity164 @entity74 event sparked a new tradition at the century - old track			1
in 1996 , winner @entity167 and crew chief @entity168 spontaneously got down on their knees and kissed @entity38 's brick start - finish line			0
within a year or two , everybody was kissing the bricks			0
it transformed into a major photo op for both the @entity74 and the @entity21			2

the @entity182 league requires teams to use the same chassis and engines			0
critics say that limits car designs , and the sport suffers			1
@entity15 remembered the car he drove to his first @entity38 victory in 1992 , when teams were allowed to choose their own chassis			0
" it was a @entity195 car , " @entity15 said , referring to the car maker			0
" we were the only ones with that kind of chassis in the race			0
" if the @entity182 league allowed teams to develop their own chassis once again , @entity15 said , " it would help the innovation of the sport , but the cost would go through the roof			0
" @entity15 said new so - called " aero kits " might help spice things up a bit			1
beginning in 2015 , @entity208 and @entity209 will offer @entity182 teams special body kits that include " distinct aerodynamic configurations " designed to boost speed and " improve the diversity of the fan experience , " according to @entity182			0
will any of today 's race cars earn their way into the museums and vintage shows of tomorrow ? a @entity221 friend of @entity80 's predicted that museums will largely remain the " same as they are today because there is n't anything new to show , " @entity80 says			1
some fear that the enthusiasm to " ooh " and " ahh " over the same car painted 25 different ways just wo n't be there			0
" that may be a little hyperbolic , but it 's not far off , " says @entity80			0
" after all , it 's variety that stimulates the imagination			0
