-- even before the @entity2 announced it was banning @entity4 owner @entity3 from the league for life , sports fans had begun speculating about which billionaire would swoop in to buy the team			1
rumors are swirling about the possible interest of " @entity11 , @entity12 and @entity13 , each potential celebrity owner no doubt more popular than the incumbent			2
or perhaps , it is said , a group of virtuous billionaires , the likes of @entity17 , @entity18 and @entity19 , will charitably unite to rescue the franchise for the @entity23			2
here instead is my modest proposal : sell the team to the people , to thousands of fans themselves , as shareholders			1
then the @entity4 would be owned not by a single incredibly wealthy patron whom we might admire or might detest , but by @entity32 of all races , ethnicities , religions , ages and backgrounds			2
as a loyal fan of the @entity39 ( disclosure : my wife , @entity42 , and i own a single @entity39 share and our daughter @entity45 and son - in - law @entity44 each have one , too ) , i have a particular attachment to this model of ownership for professional sports teams			1
there is something strange about the prevailing model of teams as the ultimate billionaire 's toy			0
that 's because a professional sports team often seems like a public institution			1
its logo adorns every head on the street			0
the jerseys of its players are sold on every corner , its apparel in every airport gift store			0
the mayor and the governor make frequent reference to its fortunes in their public appearances			0
they parade in ceremoniously to throw out the first pitch or to sit in judgment on the sidelines			0
and the people , for their part , are outraged when the team does n't perform well ; they demand management changes as if management requires the consent of the entertained			0
and perhaps the people do have some claim : as taxpayers , they lavish financial assistance upon their team , pouring resources into public safety for the games and constructing the opulent stadiums their champions deserve			1
because it is , after all , the people 's team			0
it is their team -- the fans ' team -- in every regard except the one that matters			2
at the bottom of it all , it is really the billionaire 's team -- an amateur , an enthusiast , whose whims , finances , prejudices and personal foibles can hold outsize influence on the fortunes of his or her franchise			0
@entity4 fans were reminded of that fact rather crudely this week			1
what better response than to fix it once and for all , by selling the team straight to the fans , as a not - for - profit like the @entity39 , with a board of directors , and a strong general manager and president ? the right thing to do , i think , is to give it to the people			1
@entity39 , not billionaires , is the model .			1

billionaires are *reported* to be interested in buying @entity4 if team put up for sale
@entity140 : the team should be sold as a *nonprofit* to the fans , like @entity39
he says sports teams are public in every way except their ownership
@entity150 : public builds many stadiums , provides services , has *big* interest in teams
