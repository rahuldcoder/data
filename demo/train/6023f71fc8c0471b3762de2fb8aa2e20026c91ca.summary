-- if @entity2 regain control of the @entity4 on tuesday night , they will have good reason to gloat			1
they recruited much stronger , more sensible nominees this year -- no more candidates riding broomsticks or hurling insults at women			0
they also smartly accepted president @entity12 's implicit challenge to make his record their centerpiece			0
but when they wake up from their celebrations , top @entity2 strategists such as @entity19 will surely warn them : " do n't over-read this election			0
yes , it opens up great opportunities for the next two years , but it does not open a clear path to seizing the @entity24 and @entity25 in 2016			2
beware the ' blue wall ! ' " nobody has talked much about the blue wall in this year 's election cycle			1
looking ahead , however , it looms increasingly as one of the most important features of @entity35 's new political terrain			1
it is certainly a huge boulder standing in the way of a full @entity2 resurgence in 2016 and giving protection to @entity41			1
the blue wall is a powerful phalanx of 18 states and the @entity45 that have voted for the @entity41 in every single presidential election for 20 years -- six straight			1
some states have been in the @entity41 column even longer			0
it 's not just the number of blue states but how huge an advantage they provide for the @entity41 presidential nominee			1
altogether , these 18 states plus the @entity45 account for 242 electoral votes -- just 28 shy of the 270 magic total required to win the @entity24			2
if the wall holds firm , the @entity41 nominee only has to win a handful of purple states to go over the top			1
@entity64 's 29 electoral votes alone would seal the election			0
the @entity2 have their own " red wall , " and it actually includes more states : 21 plus a major chunk of @entity68			2
they are the @entity2 bulwark , voting consistently for the @entity2 presidential nominee in each of the past four presidential elections			0
but they tend to have much smaller populations than the @entity41 states so that they account for only 179 electoral votes -- 91 shy of 270 , leaving a huge hill to climb			0
@entity79 -- a valiant candidate in 2008 -- won the red wall but nothing else			0
the blue wall states dominate @entity84 ( every state but @entity85 ) , the @entity86 , the upper @entity87 , and the far @entity88 ( @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity45 )			1
by contrast , the red wall runs through the @entity93 and up into the @entity94 and mountain areas			0
in this midterm cycle , the blue wall has proved so durable that no one has paid it much attention			2
ten @entity4 seats are at stake in this blue territory , and democrats look safe in nine of them ; the one @entity2 who will win is @entity107 of @entity108 , popular in part because she works across the aisle			1
by contrast , all of the 13 @entity4 races that are in play this year are outside the blue wall -- some in purple , others in red states			1
@entity119 won 10 of them , and @entity12 's approval ratings are in the low 40s or below in every one of them			0
in other words , this election has been extremely important for @entity2 in the short term -- and for governing over the next two years -- but in significant ways , it is also an anomaly : a year when red and purple state @entity41 who rode into office in 2008 on the coattails of a fresh , popular @entity12 became highly vulnerable for re-election when his coattails frayed			2
in 2016 , the tables will turn : it is the @entity2 that will have the more vulnerable @entity4 candidates in blue and purple states			1
if the @entity41 field a strong presidential candidate , they could well retain the @entity24 and win a majority in the @entity4 , too			1
then there are the demographic differences between a midterm and presidential electorate : this year 's voters will be older and whiter than in 2016 , favoring the @entity2 in an era when partisan voting trends are more divided by age and race than ever			2
in 2016 , the pendulum swings back to the @entity41 when their base -- younger , more racially diverse -- flocks to the polls			0
( note : republicans will continue to have a built - in advantage in @entity24 races until at least the next census in 2020 when new district lines will be drawn			2
) none of this is written in stone , of course ; parties can redefine their futures if they come up with good ideas and good candidates			0
in @entity170 , the bluest of the blue , the @entity2 this year are likely to seize the governor 's office from @entity41 because they have nominated a smart , winsome candidate , @entity173 , seen as better in creating jobs and economic growth			1
republicans looking to 2016 can also take heart because voters often sour on parties that have had the same president in the @entity24 for two terms			0
indeed , a party keeping the @entity24 after a two - term presidency has occurred only twice in the past century -- with @entity184 and after @entity185			0
so , it is possible that these 2014 midterms will be a turning point for @entity2 , opening a way back to control of both @entity24 and @entity25 in 2016			1
but to use a @entity191 : they should n't mis - underestimate how tough it will be			0
as they say : " beware the blue wall			2

@entity197 : whatever happens tuesday , @entity2 will face *uphill* *battle* in 2016
@entity41 have advantage of a " blue wall " of states with solid record in presidential races
democrats can win @entity24 again if they hold blue wall and win @entity64 , @entity197 says
the political terrain for @entity2 will be much tougher in 2016 , he says
