@entity0 -- pro-democracy activists took their fight thursday to the doorstep of @entity0 's chief executive , sitting down outside his office gates to express their dissatisfaction with him and the central government in @entity11			1
some demonstrators say the next step could be occupying the inside of government buildings			1
it would be a drastic move , but one protest leader says it might be necessary to get officials ' attention and bring change			2
" we still ca n't get a normal , acceptable response , " student leader @entity23 , 17 , told @entity1 's @entity24			1
" this is the final action for us			0
" in some minds , this confrontation has been brewing ever since @entity0 transitioned in 1997 from @entity29 to @entity31 control			1
but tensions have risen after a late august decision giving @entity11 control over the slate of @entity0 chief executive candidates in 2017			1
current chief executive @entity37 says that year 's election is good for citizens , because it will let the city 's 5 million eligible voters pick a winner , rather than a 1,200 - member committee stacked with @entity11 loyalists that chose past leaders			1
strong sentiments on the other side have spilled in recent days into large - scale , peaceful civil disobedience on the streets of the @entity52 financial hub			2
it 's all been dubbed the " @entity60 , " after umbrellas became symbols of the movement when they were used to shield against police tear gas and pepper spray on sunday			2
huge crowds have called for true " universal suffrage " -- which is not just one vote per person , but no restrictions on candidates -- and more generally called out @entity11 for what they claim is its encroaching control on @entity0			1
and they 've also demanded @entity37 's resignation , accusing of him of siding with @entity31 's central government rather than the people of @entity0			1
that 's why a few hundred students have moved from the main protest location to the @entity37 's office			1
as protester @entity81 , 25 , explained : " we want to disturb the daily life of the chief executive			1
" ' the students will be put to the test ' the activists are open to talks with @entity31 or other @entity0 leaders , but not with @entity37 , one of the movement 's figureheads , @entity89 , said wednesday			1
he demanded the chief executive step down by thursday night , or else protesters will " occupy different important government buildings			1
" this marks a shift , in location and strategy , in the movement that 's had a large , constant presence in downtown @entity0			1
letting up is not an option , according to @entity101 , a 21 - year - old student who was helping sort recyclable trash near the main protest site			2
" more pressure must be put on the government , " @entity101 said			1
" otherwise they 'll turn a blind eye to our actions			0
" there 's no clear end in sight			0
the demonstrators have n't budged from their demands ; if anything , they 've ratcheted them up a few notches in their calls for @entity37 to step down			0
yet both @entity0 and @entity31 officials have been adamant , refusing to move off their positions and calling the protests " illegal			1
" @entity122 , a @entity1 ireporter who works for a non-profit in the city , said late wednesday that demonstrators " seemed exhausted " but still high - spirited , whether they were singing songs or applauding speeches			0
@entity122 added , " the future seems uncertain , and the students will be put to the test			1
" all sides call for calm , amid debate over next steps to date 83 people -- 53 males and 30 females -- have been injured in the protests , according to a government media officer			1
the official would not comment on the nature or extent of the injuries			0
the biggest clashes came sunday			0
aside from that day , things have been relatively calm and peaceful and , outwardly , it seems like leaders on both sides want to keep it that way			0
@entity153 , from the advocacy group @entity152 , said that @entity0 authorities have shown restraint , aside from sunday , is n't surprising			1
this is the biggest protest in the past two decades , but it 's not the only one they 've dealt with			0
" @entity0 has a long history of managing large protests reasonably well , " @entity153 said			2
" i think the leadership in @entity0 realized very quickly that , by virtue of sending police out in riot gear on sunday , they were sending the wrong message and provoking exactly the response they did n't want -- which was more people coming out onto the streets			1
" @entity171 , the chief superintendent of the police public relations branch , said at a joint police and emergency services news conference that although the protests remained calm , police would continue to monitor them to ensure public order and safety			0
" police appeal again to the protesters to continue to stay calm , and to leave the locations orderly and peacefully as soon as possible , so that the inconvenience caused to the general public could be minimized , " he said			0
he also urged protesters to give way to emergency vehicles			0
@entity23 , the student protest leader , stressed that " peace and nonviolence " are fundamental to his movement 's approach			2
he acknowledged that not everyone who supports his cause is ready to take over government buildings			1
@entity101 is among those wary of resorting to " very controversial " tactics like that one , expressing concern it may cause " conflicts " with the police and government			0
his classmate @entity202 , also 21 , was even more cautious			0
" we have to keep it peaceful , " she said			0
" we ca n't destroy the city			0
" families , friendships torn apart but that does n't mean they ca n't make a point			0
that was clear wednesday , which was @entity212 -- a holiday dedicated to celebrating the @entity31			0
at a ceremony in @entity215 , in @entity216 , @entity23 and others silently turned their backs and raised their arms in crosses as the @entity31 and @entity0 flags were raised			2
others expressed their dissatisfaction in other ways , like local district councilor @entity225 symbolically carrying a yellow umbrella and calling for @entity37 and the police commissioner to apologize " for what they have done			0
" @entity230 , co-founder of one of the major protest movements , @entity233 , told @entity1 that protesters were " not pushing or challenging the sovereign status of @entity31 over @entity0			1
" " we want a right that we should enjoy , no more and no less , " he said			0
" we hope that leaders in @entity11 should be able to listen and ... respond to the demands of @entity0 people			1
" despite the huge turnout on the streets , not everyone in @entity0 is behind the protest movement			2
@entity37 has backing from @entity246 groups like the @entity247 for @entity0 , which have had their own rallies			2
they argue that pro-democracy activists will " endanger @entity0 " and create chaos			2
@entity252 , a 57 - year - old in @entity253 , told @entity1 he thought democracy should come " step by step			0
" " @entity0 should be stable , everything should be stable			2
i do n't want the stock market or the property market to be down to a horrible level			0
" it 's not just @entity0 's economy that could be disrupted or torn apart due to what @entity1 's @entity263 calls this " polarizing " debate			1
" the longer it goes on , the longer that these disputes -- that , in some cases , are splitting apart family members and friends -- the worst those relations are going to get , " @entity263 said			0
" and it 's going to be a true test			2
" @entity1 's @entity273 , @entity274 , @entity275 , @entity276 and @entity277 contributed to this report .			0
