" mr. @entity0 works in two great photographic traditions -- that of @entity3 , who devoted his life to documenting the passing of a way of life , and that of @entity9 , who wanted to make photos of nature that were indelible			1
to have combined them is another remarkable accomplishment			0
" so wrote the @entity14 in a review of photographer @entity0 's most recent book " @entity17 not hold , " ( @entity18 ) , published last year			1
known for his evocative black and white images of wildlife , the @entity20 native has spent the past two decades photographing primarily in @entity23			1
@entity0 's obsessive patience , his passion for these animals and his talent are evident in his work -- many of his photographs capture an animal in the most intimate of moments , blissfully unaware of being observed			1
in her foreword of his book , " writer @entity33 introduces him as " someone who tears the doors off vehicles so he can set his camera down at a unique low angle			0
" we caught up with the adventurous photographer between shoots in @entity46			2
@entity47 : your photos are known for " not glorifying " the animals that you shoot			0
what does that mean to you ? @entity0 : i try to make my photos a bit gritty , a bit raw			2
i do n't wish to over dramatize my subjects and i wish to avoid sentimentality			0
there 's beauty in east @entity61 's wildlife but it 's a stark and often harsh beauty			2
there 's no glory , only survival			2
@entity47 : have you ever had any accidents while photographing on safari ? @entity0 : an agitated female black rhino with a young calf charged my vehicle			1
she smashed into the driver 's door with full force and then , like something out of " @entity76 " -- she thrust her horn up through the ceiling and it popped out the top of the roof			0
no one got hurt including the two rhino			0
@entity47 : what are some tips for photographing on safari ? @entity0 : do n't be afraid to get weird or try something unusual			1
be wary of the safari guide who thinks he knows everything			1
@entity47 : what cameras do you use ? i 'd been using @entity94 film cameras but my vehicle caught fire and burned to the ground with all my gear inside			0
now i use @entity100 digital cameras			0
more : amazing desert photographs taken by paragliding photographer @entity47 : why do you prefer using black and white in your photography ? @entity0 : @entity105 and white is more timeless than color -- it invites the viewer to look more closely			1
@entity47 : what is the longest you 've ever waited for a shot ? @entity0 : it took three years to photograph the mountain bongo			1
there are less than 100 of them in the wild and they live in rough , remote , densely vegetated mountain terrain and they are extremely shy			0
i have yet to see one -- i got the photo using a sophisticated camera trap			0
@entity47 : how did you first get into safari , and what made you keep going back ? @entity0 : my father took me on safari when i was 15 , and i fell hard for it			1
when i was 18 , before i returned to take a semester course in @entity23 with the @entity131 , my dad introduced me to the photographer @entity132 -- the most interesting man imaginable -- and there was no turning back			1
@entity47 : how often do you travel ? @entity0 : i live in the suburbs of @entity46 , so i have to travel to get to the wilderness			2
the good thing about my home is that i can go in any direction and in only a few hours ' drive , i 'll find the greatest wildlife on the planet			0
