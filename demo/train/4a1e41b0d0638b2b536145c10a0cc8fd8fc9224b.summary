-- fleeing @entity4 law enforcement and stuck in a @entity6 airport , @entity2 whistleblower @entity1 seems stuck about where to go from here			1
@entity0 advises which countries should be on his list ... 1			2
@entity11 @entity11 makes for an excellent fugitive destination , particularly for someone with a wintry name such as @entity1			1
it professes a love for @entity18 freedoms and once checkmated extradition efforts by offering citizenship to tax - evading @entity4 chessman @entity21			1
for @entity1 it might feel chilly after @entity23 , @entity24 and midsummer @entity6 , but he could easily warm up with a dip in the geothermal waters of the @entity27 in @entity28			2
why stay : @entity30 - spewing volcanoes could help to shroud actual whereabouts			2
why leave : new laws to aid whistleblowers are n't yet in place			2
also , they eat puffins			2
@entity37 it 's a two - way deal : exiles get a subtropical shelter while @entity37 president @entity41 gets to burnish anti-american credentials and gain a distraction from his clampdowns on press freedom			1
why stay : plenty of @entity48 ruins and colonial @entity50 buildings to admire			1
why leave : @entity37 still has an extradition deal with the @entity4			1
opinion : why @entity37 might shelter @entity1 3			1
the @entity53 it might be heavily in diplomatic hock to @entity56 , but the @entity53 remains a popular place of refuge -- particularly among @entity60 exiles drawn by its liberal outlook , robust legal system and miserable weather			1
despite security cameras on every corner , plenty of people have managed to lose themselves in @entity69			2
and if all else fails , it has an @entity37 embassy , although since @entity73 has already snagged the spare room , you 'll be on the sofa			1
why stay : strong tradition of political radicalism why leave : did we mention the awful weather ? 4			0
the @entity80 the @entity80 police have a strong track record of helping foreign agents hunt down their quarry , but with more than 7,000 islands to choose from , it could take them some time			0
why stay : @entity87 's beaches , @entity89 's scenic rice terraces and -- as it happens -- more colonial @entity50 architecture ! why go : corruption			1
even if you 're not on the lam , you 'll still be bilked for backhanders			0
@entity50 @entity95 @entity50 's enduring popularity among expat @entity53 villains has earned its coastline the unfortunate soubriquet of " @entity99			1
" a spate of arrests has tarnished its appeal , though			0
why stay : the sunshine , the paella , the sangria			0
why leave : @entity53 pubs selling greasy breakfasts to greasier brits			0
abject lack of @entity50 colonial architecture			1
@entity111 the @entity111 have a rep for being rude to foreigners -- unless they 're fleeing justice			2
the country has ignored extradition deals in the past , refusing to give up @entity4 - wanted hijackers in the 1960s and ' 70s			1
if you 've done something political -- or you 're @entity121 -- you 're probably safe			2
why stay : @entity111 has it all : culture , countryside and cheese			0
why leave : @entity111 also has the @entity111			0
@entity126 embargoes did n't stop @entity128 from heading to @entity129 , but you probably wo n't have to worry about facing the other kind of rap as @entity126 lacks an extradition treaty with the @entity4 why stay : salsa , cigars and those great old cars held together with washing machine spares			1
why go : worrying proximity to @entity139			0
@entity126 is n't always fun for skyjackers 8			0
@entity142 clearly this would be madness			1
but at least in @entity142 fugitives are almost guaranteed to be beyond the reach of international justice			1
@entity4 soldier @entity148 demonstrated this principle between 1965 and 2004 after deserting to the north during the @entity151 , and living -- albeit rather wretchedly -- to tell the tale			1
why stay : do n't stay			0
why leave : it wo n't be your emails that are monitored , just your every waking thought			0
transit @entity1 appears to have spent several days air - side at @entity6 's @entity160 , a location that @entity163 authorities insist does n't fall within @entity60 borders			0
perhaps he could stay there , following the footsteps of @entity169 exile @entity167 , whose eight years stranded at @entity170 inspired the movie " @entity172			0
" why stay : @entity174 supplies of @entity176 books and giant @entity177			0
why go : audacious flight from justice could be rendered into another lame @entity181 comedy			0
@entity4 why not hide in plain sight ? it 's a big , frequently beautiful country and there are parts of the country where people do n't even know who their president is , let alone who 's on his most wanted list			1
why stay : land of the free			0
why go : pressure to have plastic surgery			0
even if you 're not changing your identity			0
editor 's note : @entity200 may not be a diplomatic expert but he has a long history of jetsetting from one sunny place of refuge to another .			2

@entity2 whistleblower could try @entity37 , but @entity11 and @entity142 also *beckon*
for some reason , @entity50 colonial architecture features heavily in places of refuge
as a last resort , somewhere deep -- very deep -- in the @entity4 could do
