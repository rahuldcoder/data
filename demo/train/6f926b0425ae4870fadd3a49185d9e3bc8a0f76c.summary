@entity0 , @entity1 -- nearly four years after she was arrested on suspicion of having killed her roommate in this picturesque @entity1 university town , @entity3 pleaded with a jury monday to overturn her conviction for murder			1
" i am not what they say i am			2
i did not steal , " @entity3 said , her voice trembling with emotion			1
she was making perhaps the most important speech of her life , and it showed			2
she got out only a few words before her voice choked off , she stopped , and said under her breath : " ok			2
" then she launched into the crux of her plea : " people always ask ' who is @entity3 ? ' i am the same person that i was four years ago , exactly the same person			1
the only thing that now separates me from four years ago is my suffering			0
" in four years , i 've lost my friends in the most terrible and unexplainable way			0
my trust in the authorities and the police has been damaged			0
i had to face charges that were totally unfair , without any basis			0
and i am paying with my life for something i have n't done , " she said , speaking fluent , flawless @entity1			1
@entity34 and co-defendant @entity35 are fighting to be acquitted of the murder of @entity39 exchange student @entity37			1
prosecutors have called for the pair 's sentences -- of 26 and 25 years , respectively -- to be increased to life			1
@entity45 's family , meanwhile , held out hope that the conviction would remain in place			1
" it is n't just the dna or on one specific thing , " @entity37 's mother , @entity45 , said when the family spoke to members of the media			1
" it 's the overall evidence			1
" @entity37 's sister @entity57 said the family remains " satisfied " with @entity34 's conviction and believes it was right , short of someone else coming along and saying , " i did it			1
" " i think @entity37 has been hugely forgotten in all of this , " @entity63 said , adding that the family wants " truth " and " justice " for @entity37			1
the @entity45 family spoke calmly as they -- and millions around the world , gripped by this case -- awaited word from the jury			1
earlier , before @entity34 spoke in court , @entity35 made a dramatic appeal to the court to free the two of them			1
he removed a white plastic bracelet from his wrist and fingered it nervously as his closing statement came to an end			0
" it says ' @entity84 and @entity85 , ' " he said			0
" i have never taken it off			0
... i think now is the moment to take it off			0
" his voice fading almost to inaudibility , he concluded , " i hope this is part of history and that @entity92 and i have a future			0
" " i have never hurt anybody , " he said			0
@entity34 did not look at @entity35 as he addressed the court , though he detailed for the judges and jurors the night of @entity45 's murder			1
the couple have maintained they were together at @entity35 's residence the night @entity45 was killed			1
he described the night as a happy , almost idyllic one for him : " i was about to hand in my thesis			0
i had just met @entity92 , a beautiful , sunny girl			0
" the case is now in the hands of two judges and six jurors , who retired together within minutes of @entity34 's statement to consider their ruling			1
as they deliberated monday morning , @entity110 , a member of the @entity1 @entity112 , said @entity34 was calm			0
" she is playing and singing songs in the chapel			0
... she is calm , very , very calm			0
she says , ' unfortunately i have some terrible hours ahead of me , because i have to wait , ' " said @entity110 , who has become an advocate for @entity34			0
but the lawmaker said @entity34 was hopeful			0
" she is absolutely convinced she will fly home to the @entity119 tonight , " he said			0
@entity34 and @entity35 were convicted of murder , sexual assault and related crimes in december 2009			0
their appeal has focused largely on dna evidence found on a knife and on a bra clasp belonging to the victim			0
@entity34 's words capped a dramatic week of closing arguments by the host of lawyers battling over the outcome , from the lawyer for a man falsely accused of the crime , who called @entity34 " @entity138 - like , demonic , @entity137 , " to the @entity35 defense counsel @entity139 , who insisted that like the buxom cartoon temptress @entity142 in the movie " @entity140 ? " @entity34 is not bad , just " drawn that way			2
" @entity34 told the court she always wanted justice for @entity45 , her roommate at the university			1
@entity85 is innocent , " she said			0
at the conclusion of her statement , @entity34 put her hands on her face and wept , burying her face in the shoulder of defense lawyer @entity157 , who put a comforting arm around her and offered her a handkerchief			0
@entity34 was 20 and @entity45 was 21 years old , studying at @entity0 's university for foreign students , when @entity45 's semi-naked body was found in the house they shared			1
her throat had been slashed			0
@entity35 , 23 at the time , was @entity34 's boyfriend , studying computer science at another university in @entity0			2
prosecutors and police say @entity45 's genetic material was on the knife blade and @entity34 's was on the handle , and that a @entity45 bra clasp found at the crime scene had @entity35 's dna			1
defense lawyers and independent experts argued strenuously during the appeal that the dna testing process was badly flawed and the results should be inadmissible			0
as @entity34 defense lawyer @entity183 made his final statements to the court before @entity34 and @entity35 spoke monday , he reminded the jury that the standard is " beyond a reasonable doubt			2
" " we ask you to give complete freedom to @entity3 , " he said			1
@entity34 has addressed this jury at least twice before , telling them in june she was " shocked " by the testimony of the third person convicted of the crime , @entity37 , a drifter originally from the @entity196			0
@entity197 admitted having sexual relations with @entity45 but denied killing her			1
@entity197 was sentenced separately to 30 years behind bars for the murder , a sentence that was reduced to 16 on appeal			2
in june , he refused to tell the court hearing @entity34 and @entity35 's appeal that they had not been involved			1
a prosecutor then read a letter @entity197 had written to a newspaper from prison , saying he thought they had killed @entity45			1
" the only time @entity37 , @entity35 and i were in one room together was in a courtroom , " @entity34 told the court in june			2
her defense dismissed @entity197 's letter as based on " a feeling , " not facts or events he witnessed			2
before the hearing began monday , @entity34 's stepfather told @entity2 he was optimistic about the outcome of the appeal			2
he made his way into the court through a throng of reporters , ignoring shouted questions from journalists			2
either side can appeal this court 's ruling to @entity1 's @entity234 , but such an appeal would be on narrow technical grounds only			1
@entity2 's @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .			2

it is n't just the @entity244 , " @entity45 's mother says
the @entity45 family remains " satisfied " by the conviction , @entity45 's sister says
@entity3 tells the court : " i have n't murdered . i have n't raped . i have n't stolen . "
she is fighting to be acquitted ; prosecutors want her sentence increased
