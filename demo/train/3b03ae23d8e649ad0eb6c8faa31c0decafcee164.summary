-- one of the @entity2 's paradoxical statements comes from @entity3 to the @entity4 : " @entity5 is made perfect in infirmity			1
" the poetic statement proclaims that when we are weak , we are strong			2
pope @entity9 's stepping down from what many consider one of the most powerful positions in the world proves it			1
in a position associated with infallibility -- though that refers to formal proclamations on faith and morals -- the pope declares his weakness			1
interactive : where does the pope live ? his acceptance of frailty speaks realistically about humanity : we grow old , weaken , and eventually die			1
a job , even one guided by the @entity30 , as we @entity31 believe , can become too much for us			2
acceptance of human frailty has marked this papacy			2
we all make mistakes , but the pope makes them on a huge stage			1
he was barely into his papacy , for example , when he visited @entity40 , @entity41 , where he once taught theology			2
like many a professor , he offered a provocative statement to get the conversation going			0
to introduce the theme of his lecture , the pope quoted from an account of a dialogue between the @entity51 and an unnamed @entity53 scholar , sometime near the end of the 14th century -- a quote that was misinterpreted by some as a condemnation of @entity58 and @entity59			1
opinion : ' @entity61 ' behind pope 's resignation ? not likely twice , the pope emphasized that he was quoting someone else 's words			1
unfortunately , the statement about @entity59 was taken as insult , not a discussion opener , and sparked rage throughout the @entity53 world			1
the startled pope had to explain himself			1
he apologized and traveled two months later to @entity74 's @entity73 , where he stood shoeless in prayer beside the @entity76 of @entity74			0
later he hosted @entity53 leaders at the @entity78 at the start of a @entity80 for dialogue			0
it was a human moment -- a mistake , an apology and atonement -- all round			0
a similar controversy erupted when he tried to bring the schismatic @entity88 back into the @entity31 fold			0
in a grand gesture toward reconciliation , he lifted the excommunication of four of its bishops , unaware that one , @entity95 , was a @entity97 denier			0
subsequently the @entity78 said the bishop had not been vetted , and in a bow to modernity said officials at least should have looked him up on the @entity104			0
in humble response , @entity9 reiterated his condemnation of @entity107 and told @entity95 that he must recant his @entity97 views to be fully reinstated			1
again , his admission of a mistake and an effort to mend fences			0
news : scandal threatens to overshadow pope 's final days pope @entity9 came from a catholic @entity117 town			1
childhood family jaunts included trips to the shrine of the @entity121 , @entity122 of @entity123			0
he entered the seminary at the age of 13			0
he became a priest , scholar and theologian			0
he lived his life in service to the church			1
even in resigning from the papacy , he embraces the monastic life to pray for a church he has ever loved			1
with hindsight , his visit to the tomb of 13th century pope @entity137 , a @entity138 monk who resigned from the papacy eight centuries before , becomes poignant			2
in 2009 , on a visit to @entity141 , @entity142 , @entity9 left at @entity137 's tomb the pallium , a stole - like vestment that signifies episcopal authority , that @entity9 had worn for his installation as pope			1
the gesture takes on more meaning as the monkish @entity9 steps down			1
we expect the pope to be perfect			2
@entity31 hold him to be the vicar of @entity153 on earth			0
he stands as a spiritual leader for much of the world			0
statesmen visit him from around the globe			0
he lives among splendid architecture , in the shadow of the domed @entity161			0
all testify to an almost surreal omnipotence			0
complete coverage of the pope 's resignation in this world , however , walked a vulnerable , human person			2
and in a paradox of life , his most human moment -- giving up the power of office -- may prove to be his most potent , delivering a message that , as @entity3 noted many centuries ago , " power is made perfect in infirmity			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			1

*sister* @entity182 : pope @entity9 *acknowledged* that he made mistakes
@entity182 : in *firestorm* over scholarly quotes about @entity59 , he went to great *lengths* to atone
@entity182 : similarly , he *quickly* reversed a *decision* that had *angered* @entity99 and repaired ties
even his stepping down is a *nod* to his humanity and his love of the church , she says
