-- grappling with the fact that his father was a convicted rapist and kidnapper was difficult enough			2
throw in the glare of the national media , a burglary and his father 's suicide , and @entity12 's life became surreal			1
now , the younger @entity12 is speaking out about his struggles in an essay for the @entity15			1
he wants to set the record straight : " i 'm not my father			0
" " i 'm still shell - shocked from the way these past several months unfolded			0
instantly , my father became one of the most hated men alive , " he wrote			0
" in no time , reporters from around the world demanded to know who this man was and what kind of background he came from			0
just like that , my father went from captured to convicted to imprisoned to dead			0
" he described hiding at a friend 's house " because i was shaken to the core , and i did n't want to be forced to grieve with cameras and microphones pointed at me			1
" when @entity12 eventually returned to his home , he noticed someone had broken in , ransacked it and carved an expletive into the front door			2
he said he 's still disgusted and angry about the crimes his father committed			1
@entity12 's house demolished " he deserved to pay for his actions , every day of those 1,000 years he could possibly serve , " @entity12 wrote			1
" my anger with him kept me from visiting him in prison , even when he was moved to a facility just 20 minutes away from my doorstep			0
coping would have to come before any possibility of a change of heart			0
but after mere weeks , that window slammed shut			0
" after his father committed suicide , @entity12 said he had to deal with reporters who tried to get his " knee - jerk reaction , wanting to know the whereabouts of my father 's remains , waiting for me outside the @entity60 coroner 's office			1
" but he 's trying to cope with all the horrible surprises of the past year			0
" i learned long ago that it 's not worth the effort to actively hate someone who will always be in your life , " @entity12 wrote			1
" instead of bidding goodbye and good riddance to @entity70 , the question should be , now what ? if my father 's life and death can lead to changes in how we deal with sexual predators , domestic violence , mental illness and , yes , prison safety , then we should have those discussions			1
if we can prevent a repeat here or anywhere , then justice truly will have been served amid all the broken pieces my father left behind			2
" @entity12 suicide : two guards placed on leave			2

" i am not my father , " @entity12 *writes* in the @entity15
