@entity0 -- back in 1982 , @entity2 -- just 15 months old -- needed immunizations			1
it was routine stuff , so @entity7 's mother took her to a local clinic in @entity9 , @entity10			2
what happened there was anything but routine			2
that 's because @entity15 was the nurse on duty			1
@entity7 's mother recalled the day			2
" she gave her her first shot in her left thigh and she immediately started gasping for air , " said @entity17			2
" gave her another one , and she immediately just went limp and quit breathing			2
" in the chaos of rushing @entity7 from the clinic to the hospital , @entity15 somehow slipped into the ambulance and gave the little girl a third shot			1
@entity17 would learn later that the nurse had injected her daughter with a drug called @entity33 , which causes muscle relaxation and short term paralysis			1
it stopped @entity7 's heart			0
@entity15 was convicted of infanticide and sentenced to 99 years in prison for killing @entity7 , plus 60 years for injuring another child			1
she maintains that she did nothing wrong			1
for @entity7 's parents , the verdict was bitter sweet			0
their daughter was gone but her killer would spend the rest of her life behind bars			0
at least that 's what they thought			0
but it turns out , @entity15 is set to walk free in a matter of a few years			1
she is scheduled to be released from prison as early as may 2018 because of an old @entity10 law designed to prevent prison overcrowding			1
the @entity60 law allows inmates convicted of violent crimes between 1977 and 1987 to be automatically released if their " good behavior " credit plus their time served equals their sentence			1
the law was changed in 1987 to exclude violent criminals , but it is n't retroactive			2
so now @entity17 and @entity70 , a victim 's advocate for the city of @entity0 , are desperately trying to find other mothers whose babies may also have been killed by @entity15			1
a new conviction could keep her locked up			0
@entity70 says that two mothers have already reached out to him , including @entity77			0
@entity77 lost her son in 1981 after , she says , @entity15 gave him a shot at a @entity81 clinic			1
at just 5 months old , he had a heart attack and died			0
" all of a sudden he turned blue , and all of a sudden , i started hearing code blue			0
and then of course they put me to the side because i 'm a young mommy and i 'm freaking out , " she said			0
back then , @entity77 was 15 years old			1
she could n't read and was too young to afford a lawyer			0
her parents were migrant farmers			0
when asked how she would feel if @entity15 were to walk free , she said she could n't contemplate the possibility			1
" she 's not getting out ! she 's not going to get out ! if my son has to be exhumed to prove that she murdered him , then that 's the step we 'll take			0
they 're not dealing with a little girl anymore , this is a woman now , " @entity77 said			0
