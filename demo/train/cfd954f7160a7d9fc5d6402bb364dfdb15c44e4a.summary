@entity17 spoke to @entity0 from death row recently about the new evidence that he says will prove his innocence			1
" i miss the things that most people take for granted , things people do n't want , like rain , " @entity17 told @entity0 in a face - to - face interview			1
" to go out and touch it and get wet , or to feel snow			0
i loved snow my entire life , and i have n't had that in almost 20 years now			0
" on may 6 , 1993 , police in the rural community of @entity32 , @entity33 , found the bodies of the young boys , bruised and mutilated , their arms and legs hogtied with their own shoelaces			1
@entity17 , along with 16 - year - old @entity5 and 17 - year - old @entity5 , were found guilty a year later			1
@entity17 received a death sentence , while @entity5 and @entity40 were sentenced to life in prison			1
the three teens became known as the @entity5			1
his lawyers want to present dna evidence not available at the time of the trial , as well as testimony that supports arguments that @entity17 and the two others did not commit the crime			1
meanwhile , no execution date is set for @entity17			1
" we are asking the @entity3 to right a terrible wrong , overturn their convictions and grant @entity57 as well as @entity5 and @entity5 a new trial , " said @entity53 , the lead attorney on the case			1
the @entity5 have gained advocates , including unexpected support from some of the parents of the victims			2

then she began to consider the dna evidence			2
she now says she believes the prosecution 's case was flawed			0
@entity69 formed @entity70 , a @entity71 - based group trying to raise awareness about the @entity5			2
in the past few weeks , the group has brought in celebrities such as @entity74 of the rock group @entity75 and actor @entity76 to a public rally			0
@entity17 says police questioned him a day after the bodies of the second - graders were found in the woods , near where they used to hunt turtles			2
a month later , the teens were arrested			0
prosecutors successfully argued the defendants were involved in a satanic cult			0
they said that punctures and cuts on the boys ' bodies indicated a ritual sacrifice			0
in addition , prosecutors secured a confession from @entity96 , although his defense attorneys argued that he had a learning disability and an iq of 70			0
they also claimed that it was not only riddled with inconsistencies but was coerced			0
neither his parents nor his attorney was present when he was questioned			0
his confession came during the last hour of a 12 - hour police interrogation			0
his attorneys tried to convince the @entity3 that new evidence not available during the trial exonerates @entity17			1
dna testing indicated that a hair found on the shoelace used to tie up one of the victims is consistent with a hair from @entity118 , the stepfather of victim @entity11 , @entity17 ' lawyers said			1
police have never considered @entity64 a suspect and @entity64 maintains that he had nothing to do with the murders			0
asked whether he killed the boys , @entity17 responded , " to constantly have to answer that question and to constantly have people asking you that question is like being kicked in the stomach over and over again			2
" @entity0 's @entity129 and @entity130 contributed to this report .			0

new : the @entity3 is likely to *decide* in two or three weeks
@entity5 is **appeal*ing* his conviction for the murders of three @entity9 in @entity33
he spoke to @entity0 from death row about new evidence that supports his claim of innocence
@entity17 ' *appeal* rests *heavily* on dna tests that do n't link him to the crime scene
