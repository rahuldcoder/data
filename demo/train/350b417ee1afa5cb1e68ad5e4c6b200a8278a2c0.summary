-- the recent , deadly chemical attack carried out , the administration says , by the @entity4 regime may finally prompt the @entity6 military to help the @entity8 people			1
but serious questions remain about our nation 's moral standing in the world and the state of our national conscience			1
no matter how we act going forward , we are still left with the fact that we failed to intervene while more than 100,000 innocent @entity8 were killed			1
one more genocide has come to pass			1
does @entity6 have moral obligation to help those in need ? as the world 's most powerful nation , are we obliged to protect the innocent from slaughter ? what example do we want to set for others , including future generations ? for more than a year i have been dismayed to watch my country waver and delay in the face of the @entity8 catastrophe that has resulted in so many deaths and millions being displaced from their homes			1
president @entity34 has , no doubt , been restrained by the kind of public opinion i heard when i campaigned in 2010 for the @entity37			0
then , as now , a majority of people feared getting involved abroad			2
they spoke warily of @entity41 and @entity42 and ask why we should risk more interventions when the costs were so high			0
a fear of " foreign entanglements , " to recall @entity48 's farewell address , has always been part of the @entity6 character			1
but our heritage also includes a profound concern for human rights			0
and while our foreign endeavors have sometimes led us to regret , our inaction also haunts us			0
president @entity56 failed to respond to the holocaust perpetrated by @entity58			0
presidents @entity59 and @entity60 stood aside during @entity62 's reign of terror in @entity63			2
@entity64 has said he could have saved as many as 300,000 lives in @entity66 if he had acted to stop the killing there when he was president			0
he regards this inaction as the biggest policy regret of his presidency			0
then there 's eastern @entity72			0
millions of people have been killed there in the past few years			2
yet no country , including the @entity6 , has done anything to stop the suffering			2
the world places its hopes in @entity6 as a country that stands for the rule of law against the rule of tyrants and for the elevation of right over might			1
we may not want the role of the world 's policeman , but there are times when we have no choice			1
indeed , if there is such a thing as @entity96 , it is based on our willingness to act on the basis of our moral values and not just to secure our strategic and economic interests			0
at this moment , the public is displaying a level of apathy toward the @entity8 tragedy that makes me fear that we have lost our moral compass			1
i understand that people are sick of wars and face many stresses in their own lives			0
struggling with growing income disparity or unemployment , probably the last thing we need is to go into another war			0
but we are still the richest and most capable nation on @entity117			0
and as human beings we should feel moved by outrage when we see a man being beaten on the street , or thousands of people being put to death by the air they breathe			0
as @entity6 , we should not shirk from our responsibility to the persecuted or slaughtered just because they are half a world away , speak another language or practice a different religion			1
in my travels around the world , i often encounter the complaint that in the post- 9/11 era , @entity6 seems disengaged from humanitarian concerns			1
in @entity41 we spent trillions of dollars to fight in an oil rich country that never attacked us , on the pretense that @entity141 's regime possessed weapons of mass destruction			0
in @entity8 we long failed to act to defend people who are actual victims of weapons of mass destruction			1
how many people are losing faith in @entity6 as a morally - based power that will use its might to stop mass murder by a tyrant ? the values i acquired growing up as an @entity6 in the 20th century @entity6 called for standing up to the kinds of crimes @entity4 has perpetrated for nearly eighteen months			1
in that time , president @entity34 has drawn various lines , declared his impatience , but permitted @entity4 to commit atrocities			0
in the process he made it seem that the @entity6 of the 21st century is callous , disengaged , and unconcerned with the lives of those who do not live under its flag			2
for me , a @entity164 , this season of @entity165 brings a call to reflect on the year that has passed and for resolve to make the coming year better			1
when i consider what has happened in @entity8 i feel ashamed of our country -- once again we have permitted a slaughter -- and i feel willing to risk unexpected consequences in the future , for the sake of doing the right thing now			2
@entity6 must embrace an anti-genocide policy , one that calls for quick and decisive action , as a matter of moral responsibility			1
to act otherwise will only bring us more regret			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity184 : with over 100,000 @entity8 killed , another genocide has come to pass
@entity184 : @entity6 has a moral obligation to help those who are being slaughtered
he says we may not want role of the world 's policeman , but at times we have no choice
