-- @entity1 awoke sunday with a sense of relief			0
@entity4 had roared through her @entity6 neighborhood , vast and menacing			1
the wind knocked out power and scattered debris			0
her house did not flood , though			0
" it was not as bad as i feared it would be , " @entity1 said			1
" there 's nothing i see that ca n't be fixed with a little elbow grease			2
" @entity4 left more than 4 million homes and businesses in the dark up and down the @entity21 , and authorities blamed it for the deaths of at least 18 people in seven states			1
they said it caused at least $ 1 billion in damage and warned that floods could cause more chaos			1
yet a cautious sense emerged sunday that the nation had been spared an even more damaging blow from the storm			1
president @entity36 had warned last week that @entity4 could be a " hurricane of historic proportions			1
" gov. @entity39 of @entity40 warned that " from a flooding perspective , this could be a 100 - year event			0
" on sunday , homeland security secretary @entity43 said that @entity4 remains " large and potentially dangerous " as it moves inland			1
" @entity45 and large , with the evacuations and other actions taken , we have dramatically decreased the risk to life over the course of the storm , " she said			2
forecasters and government officials warned people for days to take @entity4 seriously			1
as the storm clouds neared , @entity55 took the unprecedented step of ordering 370,000 people to evacuate			1
airlines canceled thousands of flights			0
five airports in and around @entity55 closed , as did the @entity63 airport			1
mass - transit systems closed in @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity55 , @entity63 and parts of @entity40			1
after the storm moved north , however , people in places such as @entity70 , @entity71 , were thankful that @entity4 had not left behind as much devastation as it could have			1
" it was a long night last night , but i can tell you , we dodged a missile here at @entity70 , " mayor @entity75 said			0
in @entity40 , @entity39 praised roughly a million people who heeded warnings to evacuate the @entity82			0
people " decided we 're not going to be tough and cynical and hard - boiled " and played it safe instead , he said			0
@entity39 acknowledged taking lessons from past disasters			0
some criticized him for being away during a blizzard in @entity40 last year			0
and the federal government received withering criticism for its response to @entity94 , which killed more than 1,700 people in seven states after coming ashore on the @entity97 as a category 3 hurricane in august 2005			2
" i think we took a lot of lessons from every one of these different disasters , " @entity39 said			0
people in @entity104 , also ventured out sunday to discover that the city could have fared much worse			0
" i drove around and there were a lot of downed trees , but other than that , it was n't that bad , " said @entity106			1
" it was a bit of a let down , " said another resident , @entity112			0
in @entity55 , the unexpected sight of the shining sun buoyed a sense that the city had escaped the kind of problems that forecasters had most feared			1
those fears prompted authorities to close the city 's mass - transit system and order people in low - lying areas to evacuate			2
on sunday , though , some people asked if the danger was over-hyped			2
" a bunch of people in @entity55 have already said to me this morning , you know , ' what was the big deal all about ? " @entity0 's @entity135 said			1
" there was so much expectation about , and fear about , what might happen in @entity55 , " he said			1
" we 've seen , it seems like , the best possible outcome so far			0
yes , we 've seen some flooding in some areas -- in @entity55 , i 'm talking about , but certainly not as extensive as had been feared			1
" @entity135 asked @entity0 meteorologist @entity144 what had become of the dire forecasts that envisioned gleaming office buildings swaying as flood waters spilled into lower @entity149			0
@entity144 said that when @entity4 smashed into the @entity151 of @entity152 , that contact weakened the storm			1
" it literally knocked the stuffing out of the eye , " @entity144 said			0
" it never got its mojo back			0
" meteorologists measured pressure levels inside the storm that could have allowed it to strengthen back into a category 3 hurricane , @entity144 said , but @entity4 's romp over land in @entity152 prevented the eye wall from spinning into a more destructive storm by the time it arrived in @entity55			1
" it never had that opportunity because @entity152 got in the way , dry air came across over @entity173 and @entity71 and got in the way , and although this was very low pressure , the reason why we could never let the guard down for @entity55 ... was because the pressure was low enough that at any time , if this storm decided to get its act together , it could have gone from a 60 - 70 - 80 miles per hour storm -- it easily could have been a 110 ( miles per hour ) storm like it was in the @entity185 and like it was in the @entity186			1
" @entity187 , @entity55 's commissioner of emergency management , agreed that it could have been worse			2
" we 've gotten some benefit from @entity191 , " he told @entity0			0
" he thanked people for heeding mayor @entity195 's order to evacuate , which authorities lifted at 3 p.m. sunday			2
not everyone followed local authorities ' evacuation orders , however			2
in @entity201 , @entity6 , about three miles from the @entity200 , @entity1 ignored a mandatory evacuation order because , she said , she could think of no safer place than her home to escape the storm 's fury			1
as the storm neared , she rounded up candles and matches , put fresh batteries in the flashlights and huddled with her husband , @entity213 , and their dog , @entity216 , a @entity217 named for basketball star @entity216			2
they lost power around dusk on saturday , but propane fuels her stovetop			0
she boiled water for spaghetti and heated up sauce			0
she and her husband sat down to eat as the wind howled and driving rain fell			0
" we ate by candlelight , which we have n't done for 20 years , " she said			2
@entity0 's @entity231 contributed to this report .			0

the storm largely spared @entity55
a woman in @entity6 said it was n't as bad as she feared
@entity4 has caused at least 18 deaths , though , and did major damage in many states
authorities say the potential for danger remains
