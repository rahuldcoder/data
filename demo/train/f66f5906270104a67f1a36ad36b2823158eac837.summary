-- @entity1 stopped a phishing attack on thursday , its second day in a row of dealing with a worm on the site that lures people to a fake @entity1 page and prompts them to log in			1
@entity1 has faced two phishing attacks in the past two days but officials are n't sure whether they are related			1
unsuspecting @entity1 users get a message from a friend urging them to " check this out " and including a link to a web page that appears to be a @entity1 log - in page , but it is a fake site that steals their information when they type in their username and password			1
the worm also sends a copy of the message to the infected @entity1 member 's contacts			1
in the latest attack , the web address was " @entity28			0
" in wednesday 's attack , the address was " @entity31			0
" the attacks were stopped within a few hours in each case , said @entity1 spokesman @entity34			1
he said it was too early to say whether the two phishing attacks are related			2
" we are investigating , " @entity34 said			0
once @entity1 learns of a phishing attack , either by members notifying the company or employees noticing that a url is being distributed to a lot of people , the company deletes the url from members ' pages , blocks fresh postings , and removes the redirect to the url that appears in e-mail messages , @entity34 said			1
@entity1 also goes in and resets the passwords of member accounts that had been used to distribute the spam , he said			2
the company also alerts anti-fraud partner @entity55 , which passes the phishing url on to the major browsers to block it and contacts @entity59 to take the site down , according to @entity34			0
to protect against phishing scams , @entity1 users should make sure that the url they are visiting says " www.facebook.com			1
" if it does n't use that domain it 's likely to be spam			0
also , members that are already logged in to @entity1 will not be asked to log in again			1
" people should have a healthy dose of suspicion , and ask themselves ' why did i get logged out ? ' " @entity34 said			0
" if something looks a little strange you should check the address bar			0
" @entity1 users who think they have been affected by the scam should change their passwords and review their @entity1 stream for any unauthorized changes			2
if they use their @entity1 password for other sites , they should change those passwords as well			2
and if they are using their @entity1 authentication to log in to any other sites , they should check for any unauthorized changes on those sites			2
