-- a carnival cruise ship was adrift 150 miles off the coast of @entity3 after an engine room fire			1
@entity6 passengers were complaining about the lack of air conditioning , hot cabins , cold food and toilets that would n't flush			0
as i watched the news broadcast , i thought it was a documentary about the @entity15 , which suffered a disabling engine room fire in november 2010 off @entity3			1
but the story was about the @entity18 , which caught fire early sunday after sailing from @entity20 , @entity21 , with more than 3,100 passengers			1
the cruise industry says cruise ship fires are rare , but they are not rare			1
they happen with alarming frequency			0
in the two years between the @entity15 and the @entity18 fires , more than 10 cruise ship fires were reported in the media			1
several cruise ships were completely disabled , including the @entity31 , the @entity32 and the @entity33			1
the @entity34 was partially disabled and had to crawl back to port in @entity36			0
the @entity31 and @entity34 broke down in waters where pirates frequent , to add to the drama			2
a fire aboard the @entity41 was later determined to have been caused by a " catastrophic explosion			0
" other cruise ships experienced what the industry would either deny or call " minor fires , " including the @entity47 , the @entity48 , the @entity49 and the @entity50			1
but there is nothing minor about a cruise ship , filled with thousands of passengers , catching on fire on the high seas , even for a matter of seconds			2
i have attended seven congressional hearings since 2005 regarding issues of cruise ship passenger safety			0
at the last hearing , before sen. @entity65 , cruise expert and author @entity63 said fires broke out in 79 cruise ships from 1990 to 2011			1
most of these fires received little coverage in the @entity73 press			1
it is a topic that the travel publications avoid and travel agents do not like to hear			0
@entity78 disaster focuses attention on how cruise industry operates the cruise industry does a remarkable job advertising that cruising is a safe and affordable family vacation			2
it certainly is affordable , in large part because major cruise lines such as @entity15 and @entity88 are incorporated in foreign countries like @entity90 , the @entity91 , @entity92 and @entity93			1
their ships fly the flags of foreign nations and thus avoid all @entity73 federal taxes , labor laws and safety regulations			1
in 2011 , three - quarters of the nearly 16 million cruise bookings worldwide were made from the @entity73 , according to the industry group @entity103 , which represents 26 cruise lines , including the world 's largest , @entity15 and @entity88			1
you ca n't find a cheaper vacation than spending a week on one of these " fun ships			0
" but the vacation comes with a hidden price			0
the cruise lines are working their crew members excessively long hours and paying them extremely low wages			1
the @entity103 says its " crew members are provided wages that are competitive with international pay scales			0
" but a cleaner aboard a @entity88 ship , for example , will work 12 hours a day , seven days a week , for as little as $ 156.25 a week with no tips			2
@entity73 labor laws are not applicable to provide protection to crew members at sea , nor is there any real oversight of the cruise lines ' operations			1
the cruise industry insists that it is regulated and that the safety and security of its passengers and crew is its highest priority			2
ships are subject to inspections by the countries they call on			0
in the @entity73 , ships must pass initial and annual @entity142 @entity141 inspections			1
but the @entity142 is underfunded and understaffed and ca n't possibly conduct adequate inspections of the hundreds of cruise ships that call regularly on @entity73 ports across the nation			1
and the ships are getting bigger and carrying more passengers every year			0
for example , @entity149 -- whose safety is not in doubt -- is 14 decks high and more than three football fields long and can carry about 5,500 people			0
cruise ships theoretically follow guidelines set forth by the @entity159 and the recommendations in the @entity161			1
but the @entity159 , a @entity162 organization , does not have the authority to enforce its own guidelines , nor can it impose fines or criminal sanctions against cruise lines that flout @entity161 recommendations			0
this obligation falls to flag states , like @entity90			0
the result is that cruise lines are largely unregulated			0
they offer low - price cruise fares to get the passengers aboard and then make their profits from alcohol sales ; casino , spa and photography activities ; and shore excursions			0
the cruise lines operate their ships virtually 24 hours a day , seven days a week , 52 weeks a year			1
cruise ships do not make money unless they are operating			1
the cruise lines push the ships just as hard as they push their crew members			2
a ship out of service for a week for routine maintenance means the loss of tens of millions of dollars and thousands of dissatisfied customers			0
talk back : how should cruise passengers be compensated ? it is in this environment that the 13 - year - old @entity18 was trying to sail back to @entity20			1
cruise ships , like their foreign - based crew members , are treated as fungible goods			1
when crew members get debilitating injuries because of overwork and exhaustion , they are left in their home countries			0
the @entity18 , sailing since 1999 , will eventually end up being sold to the @entity208 market , renamed and abandoned as well			2
the push to always keep the show on the road without long delays causes the same problems in investigations of passenger disappearances , shipboard crimes and gastrointestinal illnesses			2
these investigations are often rushed so the cruise is held up for as little time as possible			2
when there is a norovirus outbreak on a ship , cruise lines are faced with the prospect of disembarking hundreds of ill passengers , sanitizing the ship and then reloading several thousands of passengers on board			0
it is an impossible prospect to locate and kill the virus on the massive ships given the short turnaround on an embarkation day			0
but the business model of the cruise industry is : strike up the band and hand out the daiquiris , the cruise must go on			2
it is also impossible for governmental entities such as the @entity241 to conduct a thorough , painstaking epidemiology study to ascertain the type of virus and its origin			0
cruise lines quickly blame the passengers for not washing their hands , but the @entity241 and the @entity249 concluded long ago that the most likely and common source of norovirus is contaminated food or water			2
crew members say that infected workers often do not complain of their illness out of fear of not being paid or of losing their jobs			0
cruise lines tell the passengers to use hand sanitizers , but the culprit may be norovirus - laden salad			0
unlike the @entity73 commercial aviation industry , with strict @entity266 oversight that can ground a fleet of aircraft , the cruise industry is largely accountable to countries like @entity90 or the @entity91 -- which may or may not want to offend their cruise line friends in @entity272			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity275 .			2

@entity275 : @entity18 was a rerun of @entity15 , which also had engine room fire
@entity275 : fires are frequent on cruise ships , investigations of illness outbreaks rushed
he says industry avoids @entity73 labor laws , taxes , oversight by incorporating in foreign nations
cruises are cheap because crews work long hours for little pay , ships are run 24/7 , he says
