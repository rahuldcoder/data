@entity0 -- the @entity2 released copies of president @entity5 's original long - form birth certificate wednesday , seeking to put an end to persistent rumors that he was not born in the @entity9			1
the certificate states , as @entity5 's advisers have repeatedly said , that the president was born at @entity14 's @entity13 on august 4 , 1961			1
doubters insist @entity5 was born overseas -- possibly in his father 's home country of @entity18 -- and may be constitutionally ineligible to serve as president			1
" we do not have time for this kind of silliness , " @entity5 told reporters at the @entity2			1
" i 've been puzzled at the degree to which this ( story ) just kept on going			0
" " normally i would not comment on something like this , " the president said			0
but the country has " some enormous challenges out there " that it will not be able to effectively meet " if we 're distracted			0
" @entity33 : see a copy of the certificate " we 're not going to be able to ( meet those challenges ) if we spend time vilifying each other , " he stressed			0
" we 're not going to be able to do it if we just make stuff up and pretend that facts are not facts			0
we 're not going to be able to solve our problems if we get distracted by sideshows and carnival barkers			0
" @entity5 released a shorter , legally binding " certification of live birth " in 2008 , but failed to persuade members of the " birther " movement			2
the administration had to make a special request from the state of @entity55 to get the long - form certificate released , @entity2 legal counsel @entity51 said			1
typically , the state only releases the shorter , computer - generated live birth certification when people request such documentation			2
@entity1 investigation : @entity5 born in @entity9 @entity5 's personal attorney , @entity62 , picked up certified copies of the long - form document in @entity55 and brought them back to the @entity2 tuesday evening , @entity51 noted			1
while the president has tried to make light of the controversy , the question has remained political red meat for some of his critics			0
a recent @entity73 poll showed that nearly 75 % of @entity9 believe @entity5 was definitely or probably born in the @entity9			0
more than four in 10 republicans , however , believe he probably or definitely was not born in @entity9			0
the @entity9 @entity75 says only " natural born " citizens can become president -- a vague clause that followers of the birther movement contend disqualifies @entity5 from the presidency , since they believe he was born overseas			2
" the president believed the distraction over his birth certificate was n't good for the country , " @entity2 communications director @entity82 said			1
" it may have been good politics and good ( television ) , but it was bad for the @entity9 people and distracting from the many challenges we face as a country			0
" at a time of great consequence for this country -- when we should be debating how we win the future , reduce our deficit , deal with high gas prices , and bring stability to the @entity103 , @entity0 , was once again distracted by a fake issue , " @entity82 said			0
" the president 's hope is that with this step , we can move on to debating the bigger issues that matter to the @entity9 people and the future of the country			0
" @entity82 told reporters that the birther debate has been politically damaging to the @entity114			0
regardless , the issue remains potent in @entity114 circles			2
potential @entity114 presidential candidate @entity117 recently seized on the issue , saying he had doubts about the president 's background			1
following the @entity2 's release of the long - form certificate , @entity117 told reporters in @entity125 that he is " very proud " of himself for helping to bring about the release of the document			1
@entity117 stands by " birther " claims " i 've accomplished something nobody else was able to accomplish , " @entity117 said			2
" i 'd want to look at ( the birth certificate ) , but i hope it 's true so that we can get on to much more important matters			1
" @entity5 " should have ( released the certificate ) a long , long time ago , " he said			1
@entity117 , a billionaire business tycoon and reality television star , blamed the media for repeatedly bringing up the issue			2
@entity117 , however , has frequently raised questions about @entity5 's birthplace during his climb in recent @entity114 primary polls			1
what 's your take on the birth certificate release ? allegations that @entity5 was not born in the @entity9 have been repeatedly discredited			1
a recent @entity1 investigation turned up no evidence to support the birther claims			0
" this has long been a settled issue , " said @entity150 , a spokesman for @entity2 speaker @entity151 , @entity152			2
the president acknowledged wednesday that the release of the long - form certificate wo n't satisfy a " segment of people for which , no matter what we put out , this issue will not be put to rest			1
" " but i 'm speaking to the vast majority of the @entity9 people , as well as to the press , " he said			0
" we 've got better stuff to do			0
" later wednesday , @entity5 told a @entity171 fundraising event that " part of what happened this morning was me trying to remind the press and trying to remind both parties that what we do in politics is not a reality show			1

new : @entity5 says " what we do in politics is not a reality show "
@entity117 claims credit for *forcing* the release of the certificate
the @entity2 releases president @entity5 's long - form birth certificate
the @entity2 says the issue is bad politics for the @entity114 , but is a distraction
