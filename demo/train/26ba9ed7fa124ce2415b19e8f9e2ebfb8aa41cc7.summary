-- sen. @entity1 called monday for the @entity2 to lead an international effort to protect the @entity5 population by carrying out piloted airstrikes on @entity5 government forces			1
" providing military assistance to the @entity13 and other opposition groups is necessary , but at this late hour , that alone will not be sufficient to stop the slaughter and save innocent lives , " the @entity9 @entity8 said in an impassioned speech in the @entity11			0
" the only realistic way to do so is with foreign air power			1
" the goal , added the ranking member of the @entity21 , should be to establish and defend safe havens , primarily in northern @entity5 , where opposition forces could organize their efforts			1
" these safe havens could also help the @entity13 and other armed groups in @entity5 to train and organize themselves into more cohesive and effective military forces , likely with the assistance of foreign partners , " he said			1
@entity1 , a @entity31 veteran , said that any such effort would require taking out @entity5 's air - defense systems			1
" we 're the only ones who can do that , " he said			0
but he predicted that some kind of intervention will happen , even if the @entity2 does not act			0
" so the real question for @entity2 policy is whether we will participate in this next phase of the conflict in @entity5 , and thereby increase our ability to shape an outcome that is beneficial to the @entity5 people , and to us			1
" @entity1 's remarks came as opposition activists said another 26 people died monday in the nationwide campaign by @entity51 's regime to crush the nearly year - old protests against his rule			1
the @entity54 says at least 7,500 people have died in the crackdown , while opposition activists put the toll at more than 9,000			1
@entity1 said that any effort must include other nations			2
" we should seek the active involvement of key @entity63 partners , " such as the @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 " and willing allies " in the @entity69 , @entity70 and @entity71 , he said			0
@entity1 acknowledged that his proposal is a risky one , that the opposition lacks cohesion and that the @entity2 public has wearied of war , but said that should not dissuade @entity2 officials from moving forward			1
" there are no ideal options in @entity5 , " he said			2
" we need to deal with reality as it is , not as we wish it to be			0
" he added , " the @entity5 people deserve to succeed			1
shame on us if we fail to help them			0
" defense secretary @entity86 was noncommittal			0
" the secretary is interested in exploring options that could help end the brutal violence in @entity5 , but he also recognizes that this is an extremely complex crisis , " a senior @entity88 official said			2
" intervention at this time could very well exacerbate problems inside the country			0
" @entity1 's call to arms came as diplomatic efforts were moving			2
after days of trying to obtain permission from @entity5 authorities to travel to the country , @entity103 , @entity54 under - secretary - general for humanitarian affairs and emergency relief coordinator , will arrive wednesday in @entity106 , she said			1
@entity5 decided to permit the two - day planned visit			2
" as requested by the secretary - general ( ban ki - moon ) , my aim is to urge all parties to allow unhindered access for humanitarian relief workers so that they can evacuate the wounded and deliver essential supplies , " @entity108 said in a statement			0
@entity5 said @entity108 will arrive tuesday evening			1
she will meet with foreign minister @entity118 and " will pay visits to some areas in @entity5 , " state - run news agency @entity122 reported			1
@entity108 was denied access last week by the government , which said it was not a " suitable time " to visit , @entity5 state - run tv reported			1
@entity131 , the former @entity54 secretary - general who is now special joint envoy to @entity5 for the @entity54 and the @entity130 , will fly saturday to @entity106 , an @entity130 official said			1
he will be accompanied by his deputy , former @entity133 foreign minister @entity132			0
their goal will be to persuade president @entity51 to stop the killing , the official said			0
@entity122 reported that @entity5 " welcomes the visit of @entity131 , envoy of the @entity54 secretary - general			1
" the announcement came as government troops broadened their lethal focus from the western city of @entity146 , which was pummeled over the weekend , opposition activists said			1
complicating the matter is the assertion by several @entity150 administration officials that the @entity2 sees increasing involvement by and military aid from @entity153 in the attacks against opposition to the @entity5 regime			1
they say they believe @entity153 wants to do whatever it can to ensure the survival of the regime of @entity51 , one of @entity163 's closest allies			0
" the aid from @entity153 is absolutely on the rise and is of very real concern , " a @entity2 official told @entity0			0
" @entity163 has supplied equipment , weapons and technical assistance -- notably computer monitoring tools -- to help suppress unrest			0
" @entity153 officials have traveled to @entity106 to deliver the aid , the official said			2
a second @entity2 official told @entity0 the assistance includes money and training , as well as weapons and riot gear			0
neither of the officials would be identified due to the sensitive nature of the intelligence information			0
@entity5 's military has been reduced only slightly by defections to the opposition , @entity2 officials say			1
the latest @entity2 assessment is that as many as 10,000 @entity5 troops may have defected , but that represents fewer than 2 % of @entity5 's more than 600,000 - man active - duty and reserve force			2
the news of diplomatic movement came as the body count continued to mount			0
at least 19 people were killed on monday , including two children , according to local @entity199 of @entity5 , a network of opposition activists			1
most of the dead were in @entity205 , where 11 people were killed , the @entity202 said			2
the state - run @entity122 said families forced to flee during the month - long siege of the city were returning home " after authorities restored stability and security " to the neighborhood of @entity205 , the heart of the uprising			0
it said security forces had seized a factory for makeshift explosives and rockets , as well as tunnels " used by the terrorists to smuggle weapons			0
" residents of the devastated neighborhood endured another day with scarce or no access to running water , electricity and medical supplies , as the humanitarian toll of the nearly year - old @entity5 conflict escalates			2
@entity234 , spokeswoman for the @entity235 , said monday that aid workers still were not allowed to enter @entity205			0
@entity234 said the @entity235 and the @entity5 @entity237 were delivering food and hygiene kits in two neighborhoods adjacent to @entity205 -- @entity241 and @entity242			2
" we were supposed to be there yesterday but we were not allowed , " @entity234 said			0
" a convoy of aid materials arrived today to @entity205 from @entity106 and it contains food supplies to cover the needs of several thousand people			1
" another two were killed in @entity250 , two more in @entity251 and two in the suburbs of @entity106 , with one death each in @entity255 and @entity256 , another flashpoint in the ongoing struggle , the @entity202 said			1
@entity0 can not independently confirm reports across @entity5 because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists			2
but the vast majority of reports out of @entity5 indicate @entity51 's forces are slaughtering civilians in opposition hotbeds in an attempt to wipe out dissidents			1
the @entity5 regime has consistently blamed violence on " armed terrorist groups " and portrayed its forces as trying to protect the public interest and security			2
the @entity5 government says more than 2,000 security personnel have been killed in the violence , including 12 " martyrs " it said were buried monday			1
the @entity5 regime has ramped up raids and arrests across the country , detaining hundreds of civilians in the past two days , the network said			2
it said @entity5 journalist and blogger @entity286 was among those recently detained			2
the @entity289 announced monday it was identifying the @entity5 general organization of radio and tv as subject to sanctions imposed against @entity5 in august			1
" @entity299 @entity298 has served as an arm of the @entity5 regime as it mounts increasingly barbaric attacks on its own population and seeks both to mask and legitimize its violence , " the director of the @entity289 's @entity295 , @entity296 , said in a statement			1
" by taking this action today , @entity289 is sending a clear signal that it stands with the @entity5 people			1
any individuals or institutions supporting its abhorrent behavior will be targeted and cut off from the international financial system			0
" as many as 2,000 @entity5 have crossed into @entity311 since sunday , according to @entity312 , spokesman for the @entity54 ' refugee agency @entity313 in @entity314			1
they came from @entity205 province , she said			0

capt. @entity327 said the @entity13 's withdrawal from @entity146 " was strategic to save the people 's lives			0
" " we do n't want to give the regime any excuse to kill more civilians , " @entity327 said monday			0
" it was a tactical withdrawal in order to create better circumstances and to get ready for the next step			0
" though they are outnumbered and out - armed by the @entity5 military , members of the @entity13 managed to attack an air force intelligence building in @entity343 , near @entity106 , with machine guns sunday night , @entity13 deputy head @entity339 said			1
@entity327 said a growing number of defections from @entity5 troops are affecting the government 's tactics			2
" the regime is avoiding direct confrontations with the @entity13 fighters , so they attack and bomb the cities using artillery ... and rockets because when they fight us on the ground , we always end up getting more defectors joining our sides , " he said			0
