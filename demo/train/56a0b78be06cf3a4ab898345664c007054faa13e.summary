-- we 're reviewing two $ 99 turn - by - turn navigation applications for the @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5			1
yes , that 's right , a $ 99 application for your phone to take the place of a stand - alone device that does n't cost much more than that			1
first off , if you plan to use your @entity3 as a turn - by - turn navigator , you 'll need some sort of mount that keeps it in constant view of the sky ( and to keep you from wrecking your car while trying to look at the screen )			1
as i was driving around downtown @entity22 , @entity23 , both applications spent a good amount of time telling me they could n't get a good @entity27 lock , even after i dug out a window mount from my box of bits and pieces			0
both of these applications have most of the features you would expect ; basically , put in a destination , and they tell you how to get there			0
both can save favorites ; both even have a walking mode ( though i have n't played with this enough to recommend it )			0
both take up a ton of space , and both currently cost $ 99 ( though the @entity5 had an early buy - in price of $ 69 )			1
@entity5 also has the @entity4 beat on features : an early update added text - to - speech , which means @entity5 's app says the street you should turn on and not just " turn left			1
" @entity5 also just released a $ 24.99 ( intro priced at $ 19.99 ) upgrade option that will give you live traffic information			2
i 've asked @entity4 about possible updates , and they say they 're considering what features to add			2
my early call for the best interface goes to the @entity5 app. and this held up the more i used both of them			2
i find it much more intuitive ; things are where i expect them to be			0
when i want to change something on the @entity4 , i often find myself repeatedly clicking through the categories , trying to find a particular setting			0
the @entity5 's interface is better for me			0
an example of the interface conundrum : when i got the software , i hit the " home " icon to tell it to direct me to my house			0
of course , i had n't set that address up yet			0
the @entity4 told me i had to add it from the " manage favorites " menu ; the @entity5 app asked me if i 'd like to add it and let me do it right there			1
bottom line overall , my preference for the @entity5 app holds true			1
i like the look and feel of the maps better , how it switches to night view automatically and its on - screen and voice alerts			0
the @entity4 , by comparison , seems very low - end -- the maps are n't as nice -- and without text - to - speech , the voice prompts fall short			2
i like to know what street i 'm looking for without looking at the screen			0
the big feather ( at an additional $ 120 ) in @entity4 's hat is its car kit			1
essentially a dock designed for your car , the device adds power , a bigger speaker and a better gps chip			1
the bigger chip should help the application be more accurate with your location and provide quicker prompts when you need to turn			2
but at that point , you 'll have spent more than $ 200 on a navigator that uses your @entity3 as its brain			2
i just got my hands on @entity4 's dock , and although it 's nice and should improve the gps performance , i 'm not sure it 's worth an extra $ 120			2
so , down to brass tacks : is it worth it to pay $ 99 for a smart phone navigation application when you could buy a stand - alone model ( likely with a better gps chip ) for the same or not much more ? personally , i like having it all on my phone , one unit that does everything ( and i probably wo n't forget it in the car to be stolen )			1
other people will probably rather have the stand - alone			0
and of course , there 's a big caveat : @entity138			0
the technology powerhouse has a turn - by - turn application in beta for its @entity143 2 operating system			1
it 's free for phones that run @entity143 2.0 , and word is that they 're in talks with @entity149 to get it on the @entity3 ( word that brought a big hit to the stock of both gps giants , @entity154 and @entity4 )			1
who knows what 's in the future for these apps ? but i 'll bet they 'll come up with something to remain at least somewhat viable .			0

@entity4 , @entity3 apps use gps to give *detailed* street directions
@entity5 app ( $ 99 ) is intuitive : things are where reviewer expects them to be
@entity4 car kit adds power , a bigger speaker and a better gps chip
@entity138 has beta turn - by - turn app for its @entity143 2 operating system
