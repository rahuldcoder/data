-- dear @entity1 , like everyone on the @entity4 , i read with interest your recent interview with @entity9 's @entity8			1
many sections were intriguing , including your firm belief in the existence of the devil and your passing fondness for " @entity15			1
" you 're a fascinating person			0
but one passage troubled me deeply			0
not because of what they say about you , but because of what they say about me and us and this great country that we call the @entity23			0
it would be easy for me to laugh off the interview -- to write a column with a few " argle - bargle " or " fairyland castle " references			1
all in a day 's work at the digital snark factory , right ? more " blurbing things on the @entity4 , " to borrow your words			1
i 'm not going to do that			0
because when you , the @entity35 justice who has power over my rights as a gay citizen , said that you " have friends that i know , or very much suspect , are homosexual , " but that you do n't have any friends who are openly gay , i was at first shocked and then puzzled and then saddened -- both for you and for all of us			1
" have any of them come out to you ? " @entity8 asked			0
your response : " no. no. not that i know of			0
" at first that seemed unbelievable			0
how is it possible to live in 2013 @entity23 -- to be one of the most important and powerful people in 2013 @entity23 -- and not have any friends who are openly gay ? then i thought about it a little more			1
i 'm gay , but , growing up in @entity53 , i do n't think i was friends with an openly gay person until i left the state , after high school			1
i 've traveled around the country , to places such as @entity60 , where there are still people who are n't sure whether gays exist , much less whether they should befriend them			1
and i looked into the numbers			0
you 're far from alone			0
according to a 2013 @entity68 poll , a quarter of @entity23 said they , like you , do not have " any friends or relatives or coworkers who have told ( them ) , personally , that they are gay or lesbian			1
" meanwhile , respondents listed having gay and lesbian friends as the fourth most common reason for supporting same - sex marriage			1
many people -- especially the " shrilly liberal " media -- would blame you for not knowing anyone who 's openly gay			1
it would be hard to expect to be accepted by someone who wrote , in 2003 , that @entity23 who do n't want gays to work as teachers , business partners or scoutmasters are " protecting themselves and their families from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive			2
" " i would write that again , " you said in the @entity9 interview			2
that 's unfair , and it 's a sign you 're from another time -- that you need to do more to widen your influences , reading material and social circles			2
but i also do n't blame you , personally			1
i blame all of us , including the gay community			1
the @entity23 gay rights movement , as i 'm sure you know , was founded on the idea that openness creates social and political change			2
it 's easy to see how this is still true in @entity109 and @entity110 , the centers of violent struggle for dignity for lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people			1
a transgender @entity110 man , @entity117 , recently wrote for this site that " visibility is magical for those of us who once roamed the land like ghosts			0
" until i read your interview , though , i 'd forgotten how much this " magical " visibility is needed in modern @entity23			2
in the age of @entity130 and @entity131 , @entity128 people have become invisible anew , hiding in plain sight			0
either we 're afraid to speak up , as was the case with the @entity128 people i met in @entity60 , who can be fired from their jobs and evicted from their rental properties for doing so			0
or , on the other end of the spectrum , we 're demagogues -- screaming so loud we 're no longer heard			0
at least not by that quarter of @entity23 that still does n't know us			2
we 've stopped listening , too , and stopped reaching out to the people like you whom we too often see as enemies and bigots -- and not as people			0
" we do n't know the other side anymore , " @entity145 wrote for @entity146			2
" we do n't even know anyone like the other side anymore			2
we ca n't even believe those people exist anymore			2
and maybe this is really what the devil 's been up to			2
and that 's why i 'm extending my hand in friendship			1
not as some gay - hater snare trap , but as a genuine offer to talk through these issues if you 'd like			1
i 'd be honored to be your friend			0
i promise not to judge you			0
you , like me , are shaped by your personal experience			0
i 'm sure there are plenty of things we share			0
i can quote " seinfeld " and i sometimes question the narcissism of @entity171 , too			0
all i would ask is that you withhold your judgment of me as well -- and to seek , whether it 's from me or one of your closeted gay friends , to understand where we 're coming from and why so many of us are offended by your opinions			1
i know that will be hard for someone who wears a black robe for a living			0
but it 's also the first step in mending two countries into one			1
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity189 .			1

@entity35 justice @entity1 gives a wide - ranging interview to magazine
in the interview , @entity1 says he does n't have any openly gay friends
@entity197 : do n't blame @entity1 , blame all of us , including the gay community
@entity189 offers his hand in friendship , saying it 's a step in " mending two countries into one "
