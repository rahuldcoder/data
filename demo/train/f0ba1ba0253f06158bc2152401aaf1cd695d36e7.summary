@entity0 -- with @entity3 mired in dysfunction over immigration , president @entity2 says he 'll do what he can to sidestep the legislative logjam			1
one possibility : using presidential authority to remove the threat of possible deportation for a few million immigrants living illegally in the country , a step that conservatives decry as amnesty			1
here is a look at how we got here and steps @entity2 could take in coming months to address what all parties agree is a broken immigration system and boost the @entity25 brand , though not necessarily in this year 's congressional elections			1
what is the problem ? an estimated 11 million or more immigrants are living illegally in the @entity30 , many of them for years or even decades			1
they work , go to school and otherwise participate in @entity33 society even though they broke the law coming here and lack papers allowing them to stay			2
an increase in tougher enforcement laws and resources without any corresponding legal remedies for undocumented immigrants led to the huge illegal population			2
@entity44 mulls steps on immigration it can take on its own while @entity2 's administration has deported or turned back more than 2 million people , it shifted the priority from working immigrants targeted under predecessor @entity52 to criminals , more recent border crosses and those who keep re-entering illegally			1
@entity2 had promised to pass comprehensive immigration reform in his first term , but wound up focusing on economic recovery and health care reform			1
now he wants to deliver to the @entity33 community , the nation 's largest minority demographic that strongly backed him in both election victories and is demanding an end to the deportations that it says split up families and tear the social fabric			0
what are we doing about it ? last year , the @entity72 passed a comprehensive bill that would provide a path to legal status for the millions of long - term undocumented immigrants while also strengthening border security			2
the legislation supported by all @entity79 and 14 @entity80 would require immigrants illegally living in the country to register with the government , pay a penalty , learn @entity85 and begin the process of applying for legal status			1
it also had the backing of the business community , organized labor and religious organizations			0
however , @entity44 @entity80 have refused to consider the @entity72 bill , which @entity2 and @entity79 claim would pass if put to a vote			1
conservatives say the @entity72 plan amounts to amnesty for lawbreakers , arguing they should be sent back to their home countries because they drive up the size and cost of government while competing with @entity30 citizens for jobs			0
@entity79 want to remove the legal uncertainty for as many of the undocumented immigrants as possible , allowing them to continue living and working here so they can eventually gain legal status and possibly full citizenship			2
did n't @entity2 already stop deporting some children of immigrants ? in 2012 , the @entity2 administration changed its policy by halting deportations of some immigrants brought to the @entity30 illegally as children			1
the move came after @entity118 in 2010 blocked a @entity25 bill known as the @entity120 that would have done much the same thing			0
@entity80 argue the step meant @entity2 stopped fully enforcing immigration laws , saying they now mistrust him to carry out provisions for stronger border security that they demand in any new legislation			1
before going home for this year 's summer recess , the @entity118 - led @entity44 voted to reverse @entity2 's previous executive actions on immigration and prevent future similar steps			1
the provision pushed by conservatives has zero chance of passing the @entity25 - led @entity72			0
what about the current immigrant surge in @entity138 ? tens of thousands of new arrivals from @entity141 , many of them unaccompanied children , have overwhelmed immigration facilities and services in @entity138 in recent months			1
republicans , particularly conservatives , say two policy changes led to the surge -- a 2008 anti-trafficking law that requires immigration hearings for most children arriving at the border , and @entity2 's 2012 decision to stop deporting some minors			1
@entity155 says youths crossing the border is a ' side issue ' combined , the changes created a perception that children who make it into the @entity30 wo n't get sent back , the critics argue			2
for now , the @entity30 government considers the influx from @entity166 , @entity167 and @entity168 a separate issue from the longstanding problem involving undocumented immigrants who have lived in the country for years			0
@entity44 passes $ 694 million border bill @entity2 has asked for more money to speed the processing and care of the new arrivals , but said most of the @entity141 arriving now will be returned to their home countries			1
so now @entity2 is going to take more actions on his own ? yes			1
when it became clear this year that the @entity44 would n't take up the @entity72 immigration bill , @entity2 asked the @entity184 departments to come up with steps he could take on his own			1
sources familiar with the matter told @entity1 that one potential option would expand the deferred deportation program of 2012 for so - called @entity120 -- children brought to @entity141 illegally by their families			1
other possible steps include granting some kind of legal status to the foreign parents of @entity30 citizens , and allowing some undocumented immigrants to apply for temporary work permits , the sources said			1
border crisis : @entity118 falls into a trap the total number of immigrants affected could reach 5 million or more , some analysts say			2
" there are so many ways they could cut this pie and define and protect a class " of undocumented immigrants , one source told @entity1 , adding that the decisions expected next month would examine " what 's possible from a legal perspective , a policy perspective and also what 's possible from a political perspective			0
" @entity44 spokesman @entity217 said monday that " the review of what the president is able to do is still ongoing , " and whatever options emerge will not be as enduring or as strong as what @entity3 could do under the @entity72 legislation			1
what is the response ? the @entity33 community wants to see the details , but supports @entity2 acting on his own			2
however , it would protest if it considers the steps too timid			0
as expected , conservatives react with alarm and outrage			0
@entity118 sen. @entity233 of @entity234 , perhaps the most vocal opponent on immigration reform , said last week that @entity2 " wants to issue another 5 - 6 million work permits to illegal immigrants of any age			1
" that would violate existing law and be " a direct affront to every single unemployed @entity33 , particularly those in our poorest most vulnerable @entity33 communities , " @entity233 said			0
@entity44 @entity80 who recently authorized a lawsuit against @entity2 for changing how the health care reform law gets enforced warn of another legal challenge over further executive action on immigration			2
why is this so hard ? the long - term political stakes are huge			0
if reforms allow millions of immigrants now facing potential deportation to get eventual citizenship , @entity79 would get the credit and the likely political loyalty of generations of @entity33 voters			0
republicans , meanwhile , are deeply divided over how to proceed			0
conservatives warn that approving the @entity72 reforms or something similar would ensure that a @entity265 occupies the @entity44 for years to come			0
@entity266 plunges into immigration debate head first more moderate republicans argue that failing to do so would bring the same result			0
" we must embrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform , " the @entity270 concluded in its post-mortem of the 2012 presidential election , in which @entity118 nominee @entity273 lost to @entity2			2
" if we do not , our party 's appeal will continue to shrink to its core constituencies only			0
" despite that conclusion , @entity44 @entity80 have blocked the comprehensive reforms passed by the @entity72			0
@entity2 said last week such division leaves him no recourse but to act on his own			2
if he does before the november election , as expected , it could hurt some democrats running in traditionally conservative states			0
that would amount to short - term pain for potential long - term gain			0
@entity1 's @entity290 , @entity291 and @entity292 contributed to this report .			0

president @entity2 looks at what he can do without @entity3
more than 11 million immigrants now live illegally in @entity141
possibilities include work permits for a few million of them
both parties agree the system is broken , but ca n't agree on a fix
