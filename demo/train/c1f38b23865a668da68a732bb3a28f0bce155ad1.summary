@entity0 -- here 's a scary thought : there 's a country where officials are suggesting that the visas of gay partners of @entity9 diplomats be revoked and these individuals be put in jail -- not because the country recently outlawed same - sex relationships but to crack down on @entity9			1
in that country , the government is also curtailing the privileges traditionally granted to @entity9 consulate staff , taking down protective barricades in front of the @entity9 consulate and snubbing @entity9 diplomatic officers			1
where do you suppose you 'll find this anti-american backlash brewing ? @entity24 ? @entity25 ? @entity26 ? surely , it must be a place where the citizens hate the @entity9			1
perhaps it 's a political adversary with which relations have never been particularly good			2
all this is happening in @entity33 , which has long been a good and dependable friend and ally to the @entity9 , most recently during the war on terror			1
these are tense times in @entity9 - @entity33 relations			1
and it 's all because of how agents with the @entity42 treated @entity43 when she was recently arrested and detained			1
the 39 - year - old deputy counsel general of @entity33 was taken into custody in @entity46 on december 12 after she dropped her daughter off at school , and she was charged with visa fraud for allegedly lying on the application that she filled out to get permission for her nanny to legally work in the @entity9			1
court documents allege that she stated on the application that she was paying the nanny the minimum wage in @entity46 -- $ 9.75 per hour , when she was really only paying her what worked out to be about $ 3.31 per hour			2
even that part of the story is fuzzy			0
imagine someone coming into your home and calculating what you 're paying a housekeeper or nanny or gardener by the hour , when you 're paying them a flat rate for the day			0
i know friends who have live - in nannies , and those baby sitters are essentially on - call around the clock			2
they 're probably making less than minimum wage as well , but with room and board thrown in			0
anyway , what happened next is n't being disputed by either side			2
@entity43 was put in a holding cell with other female detainees and strip - searched			1
she eventually posted bond , and she was released			0
she is now staying at @entity33 's @entity82 to the @entity83			1
the @entity42 claims that a strip - search is standard operating procedure and that none of its policies were violated in this case			1
a spokesman says that @entity43 was treated just like anyone else			0
@entity43 is not just like anyone else			0
she is a diplomatic officer with limited immunity			2
she 's in the @entity9 representing a proud country filled with reserved and modest people , many of whom consider a strip - search to be , as one @entity33 official said , " barbaric			1
" this is a country that in recent years has had good relations with the @entity9 and where we have foreign officers stationed who we expect to be treated fairly and humanely			1
besides , she is not a violent criminal or a terror suspect , and she does n't appear to be a threat to public safety			1
if there is a labor law violation here , it would a civil crime , not a criminal offense			0
and if the @entity9 government is going to throw the book at people who mistreat workers , i could -- as someone who writes about the immigration issue -- provide dozens of names of @entity9 citizens , from farmers to soccer moms , who belong in a lineup			1
lying on a visa application is no small matter , but we 're still not sure that is what happened given how wages are sometimes arrived at			0
either way , it does seem that @entity9 marshals might have overreacted in this case			1
like other law enforcement officers , many federal agents already get what is referred to as cultural sensitivity training			0
but , it turns out , what they really need is a crash course in @entity145 101			0
the @entity33 government is incensed , and it has a right to be			1
there are questions about the procedure that agents followed in this case , and they need to be answered			0
those policies need to be reviewed			0
@entity33 officials also want an apology , and they should get one			2
secretary of state @entity156 should deliver it himself , going beyond what the @entity158 said in a statement is @entity156 's " regret " over the incident			0
questions of @entity43 's guilt or innocence can wait for another day			0
yet , decency and common sense can be dealt with now			0
those things tell us something went wrong in this case			0
it 's up to the @entity174 administration to make it right before this diplomatic crisis gets any bigger			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity179 .			2

@entity33 is retaliating against the @entity9 over treatment of consular official who was strip - searched
@entity179 : the official was not a threat to safety and the charges are murky
he says the @entity42 may have overreacted and created a diplomatic furor
@entity179 : @entity9 relationship with @entity33 is vital and should n't be *lightly* *endangered*
