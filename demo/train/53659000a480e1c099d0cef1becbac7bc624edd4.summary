-- with a week to go before @entity2 , most recent national polls show @entity4 presidential nominee @entity3 with an advantage			1
but how much are they to be believed ? as @entity2 gets closer , will the race tighten in the polls ? the most recent national @entity0 poll of polls showed @entity3 with an 8 - point lead over @entity13 presidential nominee @entity12 , 51 percent to 43 percent			1
the polls were conducted october 21 through october 26			2
most other national polls show @entity3 with a lead ranging between 5 points and double digits			1
a look at @entity0 polling during the same period before @entity2 in 2000 and 2004 suggests that political observers and campaign supporters ought to be cautious in declaring the race over because of current polling numbers			1
see the latest state and national polls when a presidential race has a non-incumbent in the lead , like this year , the poll numbers tend to tighten as @entity2 gets closer , @entity0 senior researcher @entity27 said			1
" any time it looks like they are on the verge of voting somebody new into office , there is buyer 's remorse , " he said			0
" based on that , and the fact that the country has been so polarized in recent elections , there 's pretty good reason to think that the polls might tighten up a little bit			1
" four years ago , a national @entity0 poll of polls released about a week before @entity2 showed president @entity51 leading @entity53 sen. @entity52 by 3 points , 49 percent to 46 percent			1
the poll was released october 25 and reflected likely voters ' choice for president			2
@entity2 was november 2 in 2004			1
a national @entity0 poll of polls released november 1 showed @entity51 leading @entity52 by 2 points , 48 percent to 46 percent			1
president @entity51 won by 3 percentage points , 51 percent to 48 percent			2
in 2000 , it was a bit of a different story			0
@entity2 arrived november 7 that year			1
a @entity0 / @entity67 / @entity66 tracking poll conducted october 29 through october 31 showed @entity51 , then the @entity69 governor , leading @entity4 sen. @entity70 , 48 percent to 43 percent			1
the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points			1
a subsequent poll conducted november 2 through november 4 , released two days before the voters cast their ballots , showed the same results			2
@entity70 , however , ended up winning the popular vote by about 540,000 votes			0
when broken down by percentage , both candidates had about 48 percent of the popular vote			0
@entity51 won the @entity85 , and thereby the presidency , by 5 electoral votes			0
two of the battleground states this year , as in many recent presidential elections , are @entity90 and @entity91			2
what did the polls say before @entity2 in those states four years ago ? in @entity91 , a @entity0 / @entity67 / @entity66 poll conducted about a week before @entity2 showed @entity51 leading @entity52 51 percent to 43 percent			1
the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 4 percentage points and was conducted october 21 through october 24			2
@entity52 caught up to @entity51 in the polls before @entity2 and led by a single point , 48 percent to 47 percent , in a similar poll conducted october 28 through october 31			1
the poll had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points			2
@entity51 won @entity91 by 5 percentage points in 2004			2
in @entity90 four years ago , a @entity0 / @entity67 / @entity66 poll showed @entity52 leading @entity51 by a point -- 49 percent to 48 percent -- about two weeks before @entity2			1
the poll was conducted october 17 through october 20 and had margin of error of plus or minus 4 points			2
a week before november 7 , @entity2 , a similar poll showed @entity52 leading @entity51 50 percent to 46 percent			1
the poll was conducted october 28 through october 31 , and the margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points			2
@entity51 won @entity90 by 2 points in 2004 , 51 percent to 49 percent			2
@entity3 leads @entity12 in recent @entity0 poll of polls conducted in both states			1
in @entity91 , he leads @entity12 49 percent to 45 percent			0
the polls were conducted october 23 through october 26			0
in @entity90 , @entity3 has an 8 - point lead over @entity12 , 50 percent to 42 percent			1
the polls were conducted october 22 through october 27			0
' @entity123 ' in recent history there have been a few examples of such " buyer 's remorse " in recent history , @entity27 said			0
" we saw that with [ @entity130 gov. @entity129 ] @entity131 in 1992 , when the polls suddenly tightened up during the last week , " he said			0
" it was almost like people saying , ' do we really want this guy ? ' " they did			0
@entity131 soundly defeated president @entity51 , 43 percent to 37 percent			0
in another example , polls tightened during the 1968 presidential race between @entity13 @entity141 and @entity143 @entity142			0
@entity141 led by double digits among registered voters in late september , according to a @entity66 analysis published monday			0
the lead dwindled to 8 points in a poll conducted october 17 through october 22			1
by early november , @entity141 was clinging to a 1 - point lead			0
the poll was conducted october 29 through november 1 and surveyed likely voters , according to @entity66			0
@entity141 won by less than 1 percentage point			0
" @entity142 had all the momentum at the end , and there 's an open question there that had that election gone on for another week , @entity142 might very well had won , " @entity27 said			0
there is then the oft - cited example of @entity162 and @entity163 in 1948			0
polls predicted that @entity162 would win , but @entity163 pulled off the upset			0
@entity27 , however , is reluctant to cite that race as illustrative of the accuracy of contemporary polls			0
" people talk about @entity162 and @entity163 , but they stopped polling a couple of weeks before the election , " he said , adding , " polling then was n't nearly as refined a science as it is now			0
" however , in what might be a bit of sobering news for the @entity12 campaign , since 1956 , front - runners in late october lost the popular vote only twice after being ahead in the @entity66 poll a week before @entity2 , according to that polling organization 's analysis			1
@entity3 held a lead in both of @entity66 's likely voter tracking polls released tuesday .			1

@entity3 leads by 8 points in most recent @entity0 national poll of polls
polls tend to tighten up as @entity2 nears when a non-incumbent leads
