-- the expansive , stalled @entity2 lashed @entity3 on sunday , spawning apparent tornadoes in the central part of the state that killed one woman , a county spokeswoman said			1
@entity8 , emergency operations spokeswoman for @entity9 , said two twisters destroyed four homes in the southern end of the county and damaged others			0
the woman was found dead in a home in @entity17 , located in the middle of the state roughly between @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity8 said			1
in addition , a child in one of the affected homes was injured and transported to a hospital for treatment			1
packing 60 mph winds , @entity29 's eye was still 115 miles south - southwest of @entity31 , @entity3 ( and 195 miles east - southeast of the mouth of the @entity33 in @entity34 ) according to the @entity35 's 7 p.m. ( 8 p.m. et ) sunday update			1
even so , it 's already made a big impact -- and is likely to cause damage , flooding and worse for days to come			0
in fact , the heart of the storm was churning but not moving in the @entity44 on sunday evening , and forecasters still do n't know where it will end up			1
" little movement is expected during the next couple of days , but this forecast remains uncertain due to weak steering currents , " the @entity48 - based center said			0
" some gradual strengthening is possible during the next 48 hours			0
" @entity54 's live blog offshoot tornadoes , like the ones that seemed to hit @entity9 , are one major concern			2
the @entity59 had tornado warnings out , indicating a high likelihood of a twister strike , in spots off - and - on throughout the day sunday , and a less severe tornado watch is in effect for much of western @entity3 through 5 a.m. monday			1
and even if tornadoes do n't occur , the combination of relentless rains and strong winds has proven enough to cause big problems			2
the sprawling system 's tropical storm force winds of 39 mph or stronger extend out 200 miles from its center			1
such sustained winds were recorded early sunday evening in several spots on the @entity76 , west of @entity77			1
@entity78 said wind was pushing run underneath the door to her home in @entity83 , about 10 miles east of @entity84 , while her front lawn has been reduced to mush and waters in a lagoon near her house are steadily rising			2
there was been no let up in the powerful rain , which is forecast to continue through tuesday			2
" typically when a thunderstorm happens , it is over in 20 minutes , " @entity78 told @entity91			0
" but this has been going on all day			0
" in nearby @entity96 , fellow ireporter @entity95 said winds appeared to be blowing between 40 to 50 miles per hour			2
" the rain was coming down sideways , " @entity95 said			2
" ( it ) felt like glass			0
" fire and rescue personnel in nearby @entity105 responded to 30 calls in an hour , as of 6 p.m. sunday , to help people stranded in their cars due to the flooding or needing urgent medical help , the city 's public safety spokeswoman @entity101 said			0
beach areas were " basically underwater , " as were many side streets and at least two major thoroughfares -- @entity114 and @entity44 to @entity115			0
mandatory evacuation orders were issued for @entity117			1
@entity119 and other low - lying areas in @entity121 on the @entity76 , the @entity118 said in a sunday night news release			1
just to the east and also on the @entity125 , voluntary evacuations are being encouraged in parts of @entity128 and @entity129 counties			2
and high winds have prompted authorities to shut down the @entity132 on @entity133 connecting @entity84 and @entity134 , @entity3 , said @entity135 with @entity84 police			1
the hurricane center said tropical storm conditions will extend for the entire area from the @entity33 - @entity141 line eastward to the @entity142 , @entity3 , by night 's end			1
beyond that , the new forecast track showed @entity29 remaining a tropical storm as it moves northward and makes landfall , possibly thursday , on the @entity76			1
however , forecasters warned @entity29 's track remained uncertain and said the " new official track remains a low - confidence forecast			1
" @entity29 should dump 10 to 15 inches of rain in the @entity76 and elsewhere in northern @entity3 before it 's done , the hurricane center said , with as much as 25 inches possible in spots			1
@entity3 and southeast @entity155 will likely be drenched with 5 to 10 inches , with smaller but still significant precipitation amounts in parts of coastal @entity141 , southeastern @entity34 and south @entity3			1
" given the recent heavy rainfall and wet soil conditions , these additional amounts will exacerbate the threat of flooding across portions of the central and eastern @entity125 , " the weather service said			2
the combination of a storm surge and the high tide could cause 4 to 6 feet of flooding at @entity3 's @entity171 to @entity172 , forecasters said			1
parts of @entity3 's west coast and coastal @entity33 could see 2 to 4 feet deep waters			1
the storm has raised concerns for those working on 596 manned oil and gas production platforms throughout the @entity44 , run by various companies			2
one of them , @entity182 , said in a statement sunday morning that it had evacuated 360 staff the previous day and was planning further evacuations			0
@entity186 said it has " evacuated nonessential personnel " from its offshore facilities and is preparing to evacuate the rest			0
and @entity191 spokesman @entity190 said early sunday evening that " we 've evacuated the majority of our offshore personnel in the @entity44 " due to @entity2			0
" those unable to be evacuated will shelter in place for the storm , " he said			0
even though it was far from clear it would hit @entity34 , officials in that state were n't taking any chances -- with @entity202 and @entity203 among those issuing precautionary states of emergency , after the governor did the same			0
in @entity209 , the state 's southernmost parish , authorities were using baskets and tubes to keep @entity213 23 -- the parish 's main evacuation and emergency route -- free of water should the 4 - foot levees be topped , said @entity219 , parish president			0
the levees were being sandbagged as an additional precaution " we want to be ahead of that as a precautionary measure , " @entity219 said			0
the area is forecast to get a storm surge of 2 to 4 feet , he said -- " with a direct hit , if it goes up a little bit more , we 'll have those levees topped			0
" first day of summer , and the @entity229 sure feels it @entity233 , @entity232 residents cope with deadly flooding @entity0 's @entity235 , @entity236 , @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 , @entity240 and @entity241 contributed to this report .			0
