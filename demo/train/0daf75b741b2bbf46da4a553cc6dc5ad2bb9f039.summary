-- if @entity1 is the ultimate popularity test , then the most famous art institute on the planet is not in @entity5 , @entity6 or @entity7			0
it 's a tiny gallery hidden on the fifth floor of a nondescript building in @entity11			1
measuring a meager 750 square feet , the @entity12 is the only museum in the world dedicated solely to @entity15 contemporary art , and with over a million @entity1 " likes " , it is more loved than the @entity18 , the @entity19 , or the @entity20			1
" when i started , people thought , it ca n't be true , it 's a joke , its @entity26 , " recalls @entity21 , the museum 's founder			0
@entity21 started collecting @entity15 art in 2008 , after accidently stumbling upon a work by leading @entity15 artist @entity29 online			1
a year later , he opened @entity12			0
@entity21 does n't find the museum 's online popularity unusual			2
" a lot of the fans are basically young @entity34 that perceive @entity15 as a country relevant to their culture , because of the historical and ritual position of @entity41 , " he says			1
@entity15 art has also become trendy in western art circles			1
last year , @entity44 director @entity43 made a special visit to @entity15 for @entity46			1
@entity47 , the managing director of @entity49 's @entity48 , who last year sold a piece by @entity51 for $ 842,500 ( the highest grossing work by a @entity15 artist ever ) , says that much of the demand is coming from @entity55 and @entity56			1
for @entity15 artists themselves , foreign influence can be a mixed blessing			1
on the one hand , art shown outside the country is less censored			0
read more : @entity15 artists push the limits @entity66 , a young artist who also blogs about her country 's art scene , notes that often , artists will feel more comfortable showcasing sensitive materials abroad			1
in @entity15 , all exhibits have to pass review by the @entity73 before they are opened to the public			1
overseas , there are no such measures			0
" if an artwork is too culturally sensitive , it could get banned from being shown in @entity15 , " she says			2
" it has n't happened to me , but i 've known artists it has happened to			0
usually , they 'll just be asked not to show a work			0
i guess in the worst - case scenario , a show could be shut down			0
" @entity86 , the country 's highest grossing female artist , disagrees that censorship is problematic within @entity15			1
@entity89 has exhibited at both the @entity90 and @entity91 , and at solo and group shows within @entity15			2
at @entity95 , a newly opened gallery in @entity97 , she showed a sculpture entitled " esmi " or " my name " , which depicting giant prayer beads bearing female names ( it was made in response to a conservative trend forbidding men to use a woman 's name in public )			0
" my art is very critical of social attitudes toward women , and i have never been censored in @entity15 , " she says			2
" the obvious untouchables are insulting religion and the royal family ; everything else is open			0
" @entity15 has n't traditionally championed its artists			1
the majority of @entity12 's online love , for instance , does n't come from @entity15 , which ranks ninth on the list , but from @entity122 , @entity123 and @entity124			1
yet as art becomes more accepted ( and lucrative ) outside the @entity15 , those inside the country are starting to take note			1
one of the first institutions inside the country to champion @entity15 art was @entity132 , which launched in @entity133 in 2009			1
only recently have other institutions started to join the fray			0
last october , @entity136 opened , with the added mission of establishing an art curriculum in the country			0
" art and design have always been a part of @entity15 culture			2
it is art education that has been overlooked , " says @entity143 , @entity95 's founding director			0
the art scene has picked up to such an extent that last march also witnessed the launch of the country 's first art guide ( appropriately titled " @entity150 " ) , available online and in app form			2
" in @entity133 and @entity97 , there are more galleries opening -- maybe one or two a year			1
it 's kind of a trend , where someone sees the market potential and opens up a gallery , " says @entity155 , the guide 's co-founder			0
for some artists , the development of art within the country is a reaction against the adverse effect foreign influence has had on the scene			2
recently , @entity29 sent out a brief stating his longing to return to his roots , partly because the growing @entity48 art market " treats our practices as a means to a resulting commodity , our visual languages and aesthetics being transformed into identifiable and inflexible brands			0
" @entity179 also worries about the effects of commercialization			0
" you have censorship ( of @entity15 art ) in @entity7			2
not a little , but a lot , " notes @entity21			0
" galleries want to make things glossier for the art market , so it sells and fits in your house and is interesting , and @entity15 artists lose the spontaneity of their voices			1
they turn artists into race horses			0

small gallery in @entity11 has huge online support
facing a lack of interest in their country , many @entity15 artists have found *recognition* abroad
@entity51 broke the record for highest grossing work by a @entity15 artists when a piece of his sold for $ 842,500
the *landscape* is *changing* as more galleries are opening up inside @entity15
