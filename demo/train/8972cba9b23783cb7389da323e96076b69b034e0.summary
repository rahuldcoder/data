@entity0 -- this year , despite the recession and record - high unemployment , @entity2 appear to be getting into the holiday spirit by starting to shop again			1
this is n't necessarily a bad thing given that consumer spending makes up more than two - thirds of the @entity2 economy			1
@entity2 , however , should not go into debt to buy presents			1
just as important , they need to start saving before they spend			1
it may sound like @entity15 to argue for saving during the holidays , but saving is essential if @entity2 families and the economy ever are to recover from the worst economic downturn since the @entity21			1
returning to business as usual without fundamentally recalibrating our household finances will just lead to the inflation of the next bubble			0
easy credit helped get us into this mess , and credit cards and mortgages will be harder to come by from here on out			0
@entity2 are going to need savings to pay for emergency expenses or to make a down payment on a house			1
we 're also going to need them to pay for long - term expenses , such as the rising cost of college tuition for our kids and retirement			0
increasing savings is also good for the economy as a whole			1
when the economy is healthy , banks lend the money we save back out to businesses that produce the goods and services that , in turn , help grow the economy and create jobs			2
as @entity2 ' savings rates declined over the past several decades , businesses and the government started borrowing more heavily from foreign countries , like @entity57 , to pay for these investments			1
but the cost of this borrowing is likely to rise and is not sustainable			0
we need more homegrown savings to fuel our economic growth			0
the past year has been a good one for savings , with the personal savings rate rising from near zero earlier in the decade to nearly 4Â½ percent in october			0
but it seems that @entity2 are n't saving enough , and further action is needed to make sure that this becomes a habit and not just a temporary fad			1
a recent survey by the @entity71 , with assistance from @entity73 and @entity74 , found that almost half the respondents could n't come up with $ 2,000 for an emergency in a month from savings , family or borrowing			1
these numbers are probably even worse for lower - income families who most need savings to fall back on			2
another survey , by the @entity82 , revealed that more than a quarter of @entity2 do not have a bank account or have one but prefer to use high - priced alternative financial services , such as check cashers and payday lenders instead			2
it difficult to start saving if you do n't even have an account or you 're paying exorbitant fees for basic financial services and products			1
savings starts with individual behavior , but there are steps the government can and should take to help us do this			0
president @entity102 has proposed automatically signing up all workers for iras in the workplace along with expanding the @entity106 , a tax credit that matches the retirement savings of low - income individuals			2
these are an excellent first steps , but if we are going to transform our financial habits , bolder action is required			0
@entity114 is discussing one such deal : giving every child a savings account at birth with a small initial deposit			0
every child would be able to start saving on @entity121 , gaining valuable financial education and building savings for college or a down payment on a home as they grow up			1
improving the way @entity2 manage their personal finances will take time and an effort by individuals , government and business			2
the holiday season exemplifies our worst tendencies to overspend , so it 's the best place to make a stand			0
it starts with you and your pocketbook , but a little catchy marketing never hurt either			0
move over @entity143 and @entity144 , it 's time for piggybank wednesday			0
the opinions in the commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			2

@entity147 : @entity2 are shopping again this season but should n't go into more debt
@entity147 writes that the economy wo n't be *refueled* unless families start saving
@entity2 borrowed heavily from foreign nations when savings rates went down , he says
@entity159 : try more tax credits for savings , automatic @entity162 , savings accounts for babies
