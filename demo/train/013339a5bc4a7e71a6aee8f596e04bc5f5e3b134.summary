anti-marijuana crusaders like @entity1 , while well - intentioned , are promoting policies that lead to more violence and disease in our society			0
in his recent @entity8 op - ed , @entity1 argues we should keep marijuana illegal			1
but as long as marijuana remains illegal , profits from sales go to criminals and drug cartels , and adults will continue to be punished for using a substance less harmful than currently legal drugs			1
confused ? let 's back up			0
for more than 80 years , our government has spent tens of billions of taxpayer dollars fighting a war against marijuana			1
we arrest three - quarters of a million adults every year , 87 % for simple possession rather than production or sales of marijuana			2
courtrooms turn into assembly lines churning out probationers -- mostly minorities -- with convictions that will make it virtually impossible to find employment			0
the result ? marijuana is universally available , used by almost half of @entity37 at some point in their lives , and we 've enriched murderous drug cartels fueling violence in @entity42 that has claimed more than 60,000 lives			1
of course , we 've been down this road before			0
during alcohol prohibition in the 1930s , federal agents raided speakeasies and busted barrels of illegally produced and imported booze			1
meanwhile , bootleggers made money hand over fist , empowering criminals like @entity55 to turn @entity56 into an urban war zone			2
and much like with marijuana today , even under alcohol prohibition most @entity37 who wanted a drink had no problem finding one			1
today , marijuana prohibition has proven itself just as disastrous a public policy failure as alcohol prohibition before it			1
yet despite all the obvious similarities between the two , there 's one key difference : marijuana is dramatically safer than alcohol			1
according to the @entity73 , excessive alcohol use is the third leading lifestyle - related cause of death			2
in a typical year , there are roughly 25,000 alcohol - induced deaths in the @entity37 , most from long - term consequences like liver disease and some from acute alcohol poisoning brought on by binge drinking			1
@entity83 , on the other hand , does not cause overdose deaths and comes with far fewer long - term health consequences			2
a 2009 @entity87 study determined the annual health - related costs associated with alcohol are more than eight times greater per user than with marijuana			1
and , according to the @entity94 , people who use marijuana are far less likely to become dependent than those who drink alcohol			2
even if you do n't drink , alcohol can kill you			0
federal agencies report that 40 % of violent crimes in the @entity37 are linked to alcohol use , whereas those same agencies report that marijuana users usually do not commit violent crimes			1
alcohol plays a role in a third of all emergency room visits			0
as a prosecuting attorney , i often had police confess to me how much they loathed arresting drunks , given how often the situation escalated to violence			0
i never fielded similar complaints about marijuana consumers			0
the irony is that these perverse policies are cheered on by organizations with names like " @entity117 " that seem to believe chaos will somehow ensue if adults are no longer punished for using marijuana			0
the reality is that by punishing adults who would rather use marijuana , we 're encouraging them to instead use alcohol -- a more dangerous and harmful , but legal , drug			2
public policy should be geared toward reducing violence and disease , not maximizing them			0
there is a better way			0
polling shows a majority of @entity37 want marijuana taxed and regulated			1
a growing number of states are bucking our federal government 's policy of absolute marijuana prohibition , and the @entity140 recently signaled it will not challenge state laws that regulate the cultivation and sale of marijuana			2
by doing so , we can take marijuana away from criminals and cartels and put it in the hands of licensed businesses			1
obviously , those businesses should be subject to sensible rules ranging from where and when they can operate and who is able to invest in them , to restrictions on advertising			0
do n't believe it could work ? in 2009 , @entity157 's medical marijuana industry exploded , prompting the state to put in place the kinds of regulations i 've just outlined			0
according to @entity73 data on youth drug use , from 2009 to 2011 -- a time when youth marijuana use increased nationally -- the percentage of @entity157 teens using marijuana dropped more than any other state in the country and is now below the national average			0
marijuana is safer than alcohol ; let 's treat it that way			1
adults who would prefer to use marijuana instead of alcohol should be free to do so			0
just as significant , the law enforcement resources spent making those three - quarters of a million arrests could instead be devoted to preventing and solving real crimes			0
in other words , regulating marijuana would make @entity37 a safer , healthier nation .			1

@entity186 : the war against marijuana has not worked , just like alcohol prohibition
@entity186 : marijuana is far safer than alcohol ; there are many alcohol - induced deaths
he says we can take pot away from criminals and let licensed businesses handle it
@entity186 : regulating marijuana would make @entity37 a safer and healthier nation
