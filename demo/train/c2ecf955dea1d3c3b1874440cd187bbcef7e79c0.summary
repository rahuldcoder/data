-- following a fall movie season filled with tales of gritty survival and the resilience of the human spirit , now comes family dysfunction and corruption			1
between @entity9 and @entity10 , the cineplex will boast a selection that zeroes in on greed ( " @entity13 of @entity14 " ) and con artists ( " @entity16 " ) , plus families lost ( " @entity22 " ) , found ( " @entity18 " ) , comically troubled ( " august : @entity19 " ) and created from operating systems ( " her " )			1
what a merry season , right ? here are the 10 movies that we ca n't wait to dig in to over the next six weeks -- for a more comprehensive guide to titles to watch for , check out the holiday movie guide above			1
" @entity18 " ( november 27 ) what it 's about : @entity32 stars as an older @entity34 woman who teams up with journalist @entity37 ( @entity38 ) to find the son she had out of wedlock 50 years earlier			1
it 's based on the true story of @entity43 , who , as a pregnant teenager in the ' 50s , was left at a convent where she was forced to give up her child for adoption			1
( if you want to catch up on the story behind the film , @entity37 chronicled the journey in the 2009 book , " the lost child of @entity43			1
" ) who it stars : directed by @entity57 , " @entity18 " also stars @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 , who portrays the younger version of @entity18			1
the buzz : critics and audiences fell in love with this movie when it screened at the @entity68			1
" @entity18 " is n't without its flaws -- some have complained that the script can veer toward righteousness -- but they 're easy to overlook with @entity32 and @entity38 ( who also co-wrote the script ) anchoring the touching drama			1
" @entity77 : @entity78 " ( november 29 , limited ) what it 's about : based on the autobiography of @entity77 , this biopic from @entity81 promises to introduce moviegoers to the man who became a legendary leader			1
obviously , that 's a huge promise that inevitably will go unfulfilled -- after all , this is the long and influential scope of @entity77 's life we 're talking about			1
still , @entity81 , with a screenplay from @entity92 , retraces @entity77 's rise from boyhood to revolutionary leader to international icon			1
who it stars : @entity99 ( @entity77 ) , @entity100 ( @entity101 ) , @entity102 and @entity103			1
the buzz : with such a valuable story at stake , @entity99 's performance is being closely watched as a potential contender this awards season			1
and while early reviews have been mixed , everyone 's agreed that @entity99 shines as @entity77			1
" @entity22 " ( december 6 ) what it 's about : the story of a desperate man seeking justice for his family has been told with success earlier this year -- see @entity120 's " prisoners " -- but @entity121 's " @entity22 " is taking a different approach			1
this crime thriller centers on brothers @entity124 and @entity126			2
the former is a blue - collar steel mill worker who spends his nights caring for their terminally ill father			2
the other brother , @entity132 , is an @entity133 war vet who literally loses himself in an infamous crime ring			2
when police fail to locate @entity132 , @entity124 takes the search for his missing family into his own hands			1
who it stars : @entity141 ( @entity142 ) ; @entity143 ( @entity126 ) ; @entity144 ; @entity145 ; @entity146 and @entity147			2
the buzz : " @entity22 " has two draws right off the bat			2
there 's the return of @entity121 as a writer / director following his massive 2009 success with " @entity155			1
" and then there 's the crazy strong line - up in the cast that left the @entity160 reporter calling the drama solidly well - acted			2
" @entity162 : @entity163 " ( december 13 ) what it 's about : if you really need to know what " @entity163 " is about , start with @entity167 's " @entity162 , " as that 's the basis for @entity170 's trilogy			2
but @entity170 has taken some liberties with translating @entity167 's children 's classic to the big screen			2
as hobbit @entity182 joins 13 dwarves on their mission to reclaim their land from the vile dragon @entity187 , the crew encounter mythical obstacles as well as a character of @entity170 's own imagination , @entity177 's @entity176			2
who it stars : @entity191 ( @entity182 ) ; @entity192 ; @entity193 ; @entity194 ; and @entity195 as the voice of @entity187			2
the buzz : the first installment of " @entity162 " franchise , 2012 's " @entity162 : an @entity203 , " was criticized for both its unconventional film speed and its meandering pace			2
this time around , trailers have emphasized the greater stakes and action at play in " @entity163 " -- and whenever @entity195 is the villain , you know you 're in for a fun time			2
" her " ( december 18 , limited ) what it 's about : a modern but sincere love story , " her " follows a lonely , heartbroken writer named @entity216 who finds love 2.0 with an operating system			0
set in a futuristic @entity221 , the os is a female personal assistant named @entity223 who can put @entity224 to shame			0
who it stars : @entity227 ( @entity216 ) ; @entity228 ( @entity223 ) ; @entity229 ; @entity230 ; @entity231 ; @entity232 ; and @entity233			0
the buzz : with director @entity235 at the helm , " her " made an ostentatious splash on the film festival circuit this year , setting it up for lots of attention in its limited release			1
the story raises so many questions about social engagement and matters of the heart in the digital age , and it does n't hurt that @entity250 , @entity228 and @entity251 turn in strong performances as well			0
" @entity16 " ( december 18 ) what it 's about : pulling inspiration from the @entity258 's @entity257 operation of the late 1970s , " @entity16 " is a glorious pairing of criminals and the law in an effort to suss out corrupt politicians			0
the story centers on con artist @entity16 and his partner @entity266 as they 're forced to work with @entity258 agent @entity268 to pull off the sting			0
who it stars : a cast does n't get much better than this : @entity274 ( @entity268 ) ; @entity141 ( @entity16 ) ; @entity229 ( @entity266 ) ; @entity275 ( politician @entity276 ) ; and @entity277 ( @entity279 's wife @entity278 ) all star			0
the buzz : with so many marquee names -- some of whom are reteaming with director @entity124 after winning over audiences with 2012 's " @entity286 " -- " @entity16 " looks to be all but a slam - dunk with audiences and critics			0
" @entity290 " ( december 20 ) what it 's about : in the folk scene of @entity296 in 1961 , a musician by the name of @entity290 is struggling to make something of his career			0
formerly of a folk music duo , @entity299 is attempting to craft solo stardom while relying on the kindness of friends to help keep a roof over his head			0
he 's talented , yes , but not at all likeable , as the audience learns while following @entity299 from one couch to the next			0
who it stars : @entity310 ( @entity290 ) ; @entity311 ; @entity312 ; @entity313 ; and @entity314			0
the buzz : @entity316 and @entity317 wrote and directed this humorous drama , and @entity320 executive produced the soundtrack			1
like " @entity325 ? , " the music from " @entity290 " is as integral to the project as the performances			0
" @entity326 " ( december 20 ) what it 's about : before 1964 's " @entity330 " became a classic , a battle was waged between the character 's creator , @entity334 , and the man who promised his daughters he 'd turn the mystical nanny into a movie , @entity339			1
" @entity326 " recounts @entity339 's persistent wooing of @entity334 and the behind the scenes give - and - take that led to " @entity330 " being made			0
who it stars : @entity344 ( @entity339 ) ; @entity345 ( @entity334 ) ; @entity346 ; @entity347 and @entity348			0
the buzz : directed by @entity351 , critics have praised @entity339 for not turning " @entity326 " into a self - admiring love letter -- a feat owed in great amounts to the performances of @entity344 and @entity345			0
" @entity356 " ( december 25 ) what it 's about : in the 1990s , penny stockbroker @entity359 was living a life of extreme decadence won from his fraudulent scheming -- that is , until his house of cards began to crumble and resulted in his arrest			0
@entity359 's swindling , already captured in his memoir " @entity13 of @entity14 , " is making the leap to the big screen with @entity371 as the " wolf " himself			0
who it stars : directed by @entity375 , " @entity13 of @entity14 " also stars @entity376 ; @entity377 ; @entity378 and @entity379			0
the buzz : the movie 's release recently had a close call when it looked like it was going to drop off the 2013 calendar altogether ; thankfully , @entity386 is still going to make the cut with the december 25 release date			1
the combination of @entity375 and @entity371 is n't always a sure thing -- remember " @entity391 " ? -- but we 're placing our bets with this delicious look at the perils of excess			0
" august : @entity19 " ( december 25 ) what it 's about : the story here originated with @entity401 ' award - winning 2007 stage production , which has been transformed for the screen with @entity404 at the helm			0
" august : @entity19 " reunites the three daughters of the @entity409 - based @entity408 family , grounded by cancer - stricken matriarch @entity410 , after a painful loss			1
what results is a darkly funny examination of the ties that bind			0
who it stars : this cast is virtual awards - season catnip , packed with the likes of @entity421 ( @entity410 ) , @entity422 , @entity423 , @entity424 , @entity195 , @entity425 , @entity426 and @entity146 , among others			1
the buzz : early reviews from film festivals suggest that " august : @entity19 " has n't rid an ounce of its theatricality as it moved from stage to screen , and @entity421 in particular goes big with her role			0
yet subtle and compelling performances from supporting cast , mixed with the story 's juicy , humorous drama , should nonetheless make it a draw .			0
