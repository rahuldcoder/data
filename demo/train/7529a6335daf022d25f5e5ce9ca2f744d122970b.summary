-- the @entity1 did not go far enough when it proposed the repeal of certain provisions of the mortgage interest deduction			0
the deduction for mortgage interest should be repealed in its entirety			0
most people know that owning a home comes with tax advantages such as the deduction for mortgage interest , but they do n't know how much of an anomaly that is			2
most personal , family or living expenses are not tax deductible			2
they are the result of choices			0
your decisions on what to wear to work or whether to pay cash or credit are your personal choices			0
you do n't get a tax deduction			0
that 's why rent is not deductible , even though roughly one - third of @entity29 are renters -- which includes the majority of blacks and @entity34			1
where you live is considered to be the result of a personal choice			1
the deduction for mortgage interest is a huge exception to the general rule , because what could be more personal than the decision to buy a home ? in 1986 , an exception was made for home mortgage interest as a way to " encourage homeownership			1
" that 's the good news for homeowners			0
the bad news for renters is that the 2010 estimated revenue loss of the tax subsidy for homeownership is greater than $ 200 billion			1
by comparison , the entire @entity57 budget is less than $ 50 billion			2
that is a pretty high price to pay to " encourage homeownership			1
" but as long as it actually encourages people to buy homes , it could be money well spent			1
yet economists generally believe that the mortgage interest deduction does virtually nothing to encourage people to buy homes			1
during the past 40 years , while tax rates have changed dramatically ( making the value of the tax benefits fluctuate ) , the homeownership rate has been quite stable			2
the biggest increase in homeownership rates happened after @entity77 and came after innovations in mortgage financing			0
that does not mean that homeowners are n't aware of the tax break when they buy a house			1
in fact , they are paying for the tax subsidy when they buy their homes , because the mortgage interest deduction is built into the price			1
but homeowners do not decide to buy a house because of the tax break			1
research shows that the tax deduction simply rewards behavior -- buying a home -- that was going to happen anyway			2
the tax subsidy does encourage the purchase of bigger and more expensive homes ; tax dollars are subsidizing @entity99			1
the @entity29 people are getting nothing good for their $ 200 billion subsidy			1
in order to benefit from the mortgage interest deduction , homeowners must itemize deductions and not take the standard deduction			0
president @entity109 's @entity108 documented that only 54 percent of those with mortgages benefit from the mortgage interest deduction			0
that means 46 percent of homeowners have paid for the benefit of the mortgage interest deduction when they bought their house but do not receive any tax benefits			0
so most low - income homeowners are paying for a tax benefit that only a few will receive			2
the overwhelming majority of homeowners whose household income is $ 40,000 or less do not receive any tax benefit from mortgage interest payments			0
once income hits $ 50,000 , then the majority of homeowners do receive tax benefits			0
clearly , tax benefits for the mortgage interest deduction are flowing to middle and upper income taxpayers			0
while the mortgage interest deduction may help people who are struggling to make ends meet , they are not the only ones struggling			0
according to a may 2010 @entity144 article , the ranks of renters are increasing because of record foreclosures			0
struggling or not , these new renters will not have a tax subsidy			2
should we continue giving away a $ 200 billion subsidy every year to middle - and upper - income taxpayers to " encourage " them to do what they were already going to do ? we simply can not afford it any longer			1
the @entity29 public must be convinced that repeal of the mortgage interest deduction is a first step in the larger goal toward creating a tax code that is fairer for all and treats renters and homeowners alike			1
we all have housing costs			0
why should only some get a tax break ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity169 .			1

@entity169 : it 's *unusual* to get a tax break for a personal choice such as buying a home
renting is not deductible , she says , even though about one - third of @entity29 are renters
@entity169 : tax break meant to " encourage homeownership , " but people buy homes anyway
tax break is a $ 200 billion subsidy every year for those with higher incomes , she says
