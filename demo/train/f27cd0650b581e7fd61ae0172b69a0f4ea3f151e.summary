@entity0 and four neighboring countries will share intelligence and border surveillance in the hunt for more than 200 @entity0 girls still held by @entity6 , and @entity8 nations will provide technical expertise and training to the new regional @entity12 effort against the extreme @entity13			1
the plan was announced saturday at the conclusion of a security summit in @entity17 hosted by @entity19 president @entity18			1
@entity18 described @entity6 as now a bigger terror threat than first portrayed -- beyond @entity0 and even @entity21			1
" @entity6 is an organization that is linked to terrorism in @entity21 and whose will is to destabilize the north of @entity0 , certainly , and all the neighboring countries of @entity0 and beyond that region , " he said			1
@entity28 president @entity27 was more forceful in describing how partnering countries will " take stronger measures to eradicate " the extremist @entity31 group			1
" we 're here to declare war on @entity6 , " @entity27 said			1
as the summit took place saturday , reports emerged about the latest apparent @entity6 attack , this one in @entity28			1
@entity18 said one @entity28 soldier was killed in the friday night attack against @entity42 nationals in northern @entity28 , which is known as a stronghold for the @entity13 extremists			1
ten @entity42 nationals are missing after the attack , a @entity42 official said saturday			1
one injured person was being treated by a @entity42 medical team in the @entity52 capital of @entity53 , said @entity54 , first counselor of the @entity55 in @entity56 , @entity28 's capital			1
@entity0 military @entity19 " will not intervene " militarily in @entity0 because @entity0 " has military forces that are available and efficient , " @entity18 said during an interview with @entity19 24 that aired late saturday			1
the @entity0 military suffered an embarrassing setback in april when it retracted a report that nearly all the kidnapped girls were released			2
in fact , the girls , taken from a boarding school in @entity65 , were still missing			0
@entity0 now has 20,000 troops , plus aircraft and intelligence sources , in parts of its nation where @entity6 is active , said president @entity72			1
" @entity6 is no longer a local terror group , " @entity72 said			2
" it is clearly operating as an @entity75 operation " in @entity21 , he said			1
" the major challenge that we have faced in our search and rescue operation so far has been the deluge of misinformation about the whereabouts of the girls and the circumstances of their disappearance , " the president added			2
@entity6 's guerrilla campaign has claimed 12,000 lives , with 8,000 people injured or maimed since 2009 , @entity72 said			2
@entity0 will coordinate patrols , pool intelligence and exchange weapons and human trafficking information with @entity93 , @entity28 , @entity52 and @entity94 , according to the agreement reached at the summit			1
@entity19 , the @entity105 , the @entity106 and the @entity107 " will coordinate their support for this regional cooperation " through technical expertise , training programs and support for border - area management programs , a summit statement said			2
the participants agreed that the @entity106 will host a follow - up meeting next month to review the action plan			0
in the meantime , participants committed to accelerating international sanctions against @entity6 and its leaders through the @entity115			2
@entity6 translates as " @entity8 education is a sin " in the @entity119 language			2
the militant group says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of @entity124 law across @entity0 , @entity21 's most populous nation , which is split between a majority @entity127 north and a mostly @entity130 south			1
@entity6 's attacks have intensified in recent years			2
the summit the @entity0 president joined saturday 's summit of @entity12 presidents and @entity105 , @entity106 and @entity107 representatives on the growing threat from @entity6 as @entity105 officials expressed concerns about his military 's ability to rescue hundreds of schoolgirls abducted last month			1
the terror group abducted an estimated 276 girls on april 14 from a boarding school in @entity65 in northeastern @entity0			2
dozens escaped , but more than 200 girls are still missing			0
@entity0 have accused their government of not acting swiftly or efficiently enough to protect the girls seized in the dead of night			0
and the criticism shows no signs of abating , even from allies who 've pledged to help in the rescue mission			0
the @entity105 , @entity42 and @entity106 are among a handful of nations providing advice			0
the @entity105 is using drones and manned surveillance aircraft in the search , but has said @entity0 is reluctant to use the information provided			0
" the division in the north that mainly is engaging with @entity6 , the @entity169 , has recently shown signs of real fear , " said @entity164 , @entity165 director for the @entity166			0
" they do not have the capabilities , the training or the equipment that @entity6 does , and @entity6 is exceptionally brutal and indiscriminate in their attacks			0
" " i would say an even greater concern is the incapacity of the @entity0 military and the @entity0 government 's failure to provide leadership to the military , " @entity164 said thursday at a hearing of the @entity180			0
for now , the @entity105 is not sharing raw intelligence from its surveillance aircraft with @entity0 's armed forces because the countries have not established the intelligence - sharing protocols and safeguards needed for such an agreement , @entity166 spokesman col. @entity188 said wednesday			0
there 's also concern about how the information will be used by a military that 's been accused of human rights violations itself			0
" we have sought assurances from them ... that they will use any information that we pass to them from this ( intelligence surveillance and reconnaissance ) support in a manner consistent with international humanitarian and human rights law , " @entity164 explained			0
@entity0 has been accused of not doing enough to protect the girls abducted from a militant hotbed that was already under a state of emergency			0
but a spokesman for the military defended the nation 's response			0
" @entity219 is under a state of emergency , over 90,000 square kilometers , " said maj. gen. @entity218			0
" are you saying we should deploy ... soldiers in over 90,000 kilometers -- one soldier per kilometer ? you can imagine that expense for one of the states under a state of emergency			0

@entity19 will not intervene militarily in @entity0 , president says
@entity28 soldier killed , 10 @entity42 missing , one injured after @entity6 attack
@entity6 acts as an @entity75 operation in @entity21 , @entity0 says
" we 're here to declare war on @entity6 , " @entity28 leader says at summit
