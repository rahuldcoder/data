-- in what country would the presidential palace auction off some of its finest wines to buy more wine and boost state coffers ? @entity6 , bien sûr ! the @entity8 -- the official residence of the @entity6 president -- has dipped into its wine cellars and put 1,200 bottles up for auction in @entity13			1
mainly from @entity15 and @entity16 , the wines would normally have been served to ambassadors or visiting dignitaries as they dined with the president , showing off the finest of @entity6 viticulture in the process			2
the funds raised will allow the renewal of the palace 's wine stocks , auction house @entity23 said			1
" more modest " wines will be bought in place of some of the fine vintages put under the hammer , with any extra money left poured back into the state budget , it said			1
the @entity8 's head sommelier , @entity37 , picked the wines to be auctioned off in two sales , on thursday and friday			1
the 1,200 bottles represent about a tenth of the cellar 's total stocks			1
some date back decades , while others are newer but represent great vintages			0
the auction house expects the bids to range between 15 euros ( $ 19 ) for the most ordinary and an estimated 2,200 euros ( $ 2,800 ) for a 1990 @entity48			1
many bidders should be able to get their hands on a bottle for less than 100 euros , the auction house said			1
all the bottles auctioned off will sport a label stating that they came from the @entity8 , with the date of their sale , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity59			2
the palace cellar was set up in 1947 , during the presidency of @entity62 , and was reorganized in 1995 to ensure the best conditions for keeping the wines			2
built up over decades , it includes wines from @entity67 , the @entity68 , the @entity69 and the @entity70 alongside those from @entity16 and @entity15			0
" all these wines were served at the table of the @entity74 , and some of them have accompanied important moments in the history of the @entity78 , " said @entity23			0
the @entity78 was established in 1958 and continues to this day , under president @entity79			0
elected last year , he has sought to boost tax revenues from the wealthy to try to cut @entity6 's large deficit			1
the history and associations of the @entity8 wine may be expected to push prices up beyond what would be paid for similar bottles sold elsewhere			2
@entity88 , investment manager at the @entity89 in @entity90 , told @entity0 the @entity8 auction would be likely to draw buyers who are attracted by the kudos of the wines ' provenance rather than serious investors			0
the wines are mostly mature and ready to be drunk sooner rather than later , which makes them less of an investment buy , he said , although the 1990 @entity48 is a very good wine			0
" the wine is not especially rare or unusual -- they are the sort of wines that crop up at auction every now or then , " he said			0
" the fact that they are from the @entity8 gives them a certain sort of extra kudos that people may be prepared to pay a small premium for			2
" a recent sale from the cellars of the @entity116 government saw just that effect , @entity88 said , with wines fetching more than might have been expected			0
this was in part because of their good provenance , he said , but also because they " have that slight cachet that wines from the same stock that 's been drunk by president @entity125 , or whoever 's drunk the poshest wine from the cellars , have			0

any extra funds will be poured into the state budget , it says
the presidential wine cellar , set up in 1947 , *showcases* some of @entity6 's finest vintages
