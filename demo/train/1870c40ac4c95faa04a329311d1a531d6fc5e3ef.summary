-- " @entity3 's " midseason finale on sunday - watched by a staggering 14.8 million viewers - was about as intense as it gets			1
there was @entity6 's army returning to the church in just the nick of time and @entity9 putting down a cop who would n't stop running			1
@entity11 pushed yet another cop , the threatening @entity12 , down an elevator , and @entity14 found his way back to the church just as our group of survivors left it			2
but all of that action paled in comparison to the big , heartbreaking exchange at @entity24 ( and if you went to the show 's official @entity27 or @entity29 right afterward , you know what happened )			2
@entity31 and @entity11 had finally been reunited with their people when @entity33 demanded that @entity9 return her former ward , @entity34			2
@entity9 objected , but @entity34 decided to go back			0
and then it happened : one of @entity33 's comments set @entity11 off , leading to an altercation that ended with @entity33 shooting @entity11 in the head			0
it was a shocking , tragic end for a beloved character			1
the look on @entity43 's face as he carried @entity11 's body , followed by the anguish on her sister @entity47 's face , said it all			0
one year after we saw the death of patriarch @entity52 , the @entity49 family had lost someone else			0
viewers struggled to come to terms with the character 's death on @entity58			1
" if @entity43 cries , you know it was a bad night on # @entity61			0
# @entity63 , " said @entity62			0
@entity64 did n't know how he was going to get through the work day after that death			0
@entity67 was " still crying because @entity3			1
" @entity68 of " @entity69 " and " @entity70 " summed it all up with " @entity72			0
" so what can we expect next ? unfortunately , fans will have to mull over this episode for a while , as " @entity3 " does n't return to @entity78 until february			1
