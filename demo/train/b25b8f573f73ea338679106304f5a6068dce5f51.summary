@entity2 used to be simple			0
you simply died , and that was it			0
now , in the modern era of high - tech medicine , death is difficult , too			1
the predicament facing @entity10 , who has been critically ill for the past five weeks and turns 95 on thursday , brings into sharp focus an important question that eventually affects all of us			1
how do we want to die ? @entity10 is one of the most influential and important people on @entity16 , but nothing about his situation is unique or special			1
@entity19 -- those doctors who specialize in intensive care patients -- will tell you that every day thousands of people all over the world are going through the same thing			1
playing out the end game , many of them are stuck on a ventilator with a slim to vanishing chance of ever getting back to the life they knew and loved			1
modern society is confronting a tragic , silent epidemic of frail elderly people who suffer needlessly at the end of life because of unwanted life support			1
these folks are effectively left to die a slow death connected to machines			1
as a critical care specialist who has seen this process play out many times , it can be agonizing to witness			0
how did we end up here ? why has death become so complicated ? modern medicine is powerful , but it is a double - edged sword			1
the way we can bring people back from the brink of death is truly amazing			1
there is nothing more satisfying professionally than having a grateful patent walk back into the @entity55 after surviving a near - death experience			2
but more often , for very old people , aggressive life support does n't work out so well			1
prolonged icu care often gradually evolves into a checkmate situation			0
intensivists know what it usually means when the condition of an elderly person hospitalized for weeks is described as " critical but stable			2
" after weeks of aggressive support , the patient still can not survive off the ventilator			2
when this happens , the muscles start to wither away from a condition called @entity55 - acquired myopathy			0
@entity72 may seem to be happening , but as the body inevitably continues to weaken , a relentless series of secondary complications will ensue , such as pneumonia , delirium and failure of the circulatory system or kidneys			0
in most cases , patients need to be continuously sedated to minimize obvious pain and suffering			2
when do you stop ? how do you stop ? and who decides ? these are the wrenching issues that confront the family			0
the fundamental question is this : when is it time to accept the inevitability of death , change the goal of care to comfort , and let the patient have peace ? it used to be that doctors struggled with withdrawing life support , or would n't even consider it			1
at the height of the @entity109 era in the mid- 1990s the chairman of our hospital ethics committee , a good friend and colleague , told me that withdrawing life support should always be difficult and make me uncomfortable			2
i could n't have agreed less , but i did n't tell him			2
thankfully over the years , his views and those of most physicians have changed			0
unlike my generation , medical students are now trained in ethics and palliative care			0
more patients have advance directives and living wills			0
every intensivist will tell you that withdrawing life support and helping someone " make the transition " with comfort and dignity is one of the most satisfying and useful things that they can do			2
but despite this progress , there is still a fundamental disconnect			0
the epidemic of futile support at the end - of - life persists			1
the major reason is a perfect storm created by the power of modern medical technology , our cultural emphasis on patient autonomy and the innate human tendency to deny and hide from the reality of death			1
death is scary and makes us uncomfortable			1
modern culture has insulated us from witnessing death			2
we are out of touch with the life cycle			0
we also believe that the patient should call the shots and get the care he or she wants			0
but what happens when the patient can no longer express his or her wishes ? spouses , children and family are forced to make life - and - death decisions that they never volunteered to make , sometimes may not be equipped to make , or unrealistically assumed they would never have to make			1
but make no mistake : unless death is sudden , one day you will need to decide when to allow someone you love to die , and someone will have to make that decision for you			1
@entity170 often hear this : " i know my dad would n't want this , but i just ca n't bring myself to do it			0
" advance directives or a living will do not necessarily mean you will get the end - of - life care that you want			0
this is because withdrawing life support depends on your decision - makers , usually your loved ones , understanding and believing that you are past the point of no return			1
it depends on accepting death			0
@entity10 fought for freedom all of his life , and the world does not want to lose him			1
now all we can hope for is that he is comfortable , and getting the care that he would want			0
if and when the day comes that he has fought long enough , it will be ok to let him be free			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

@entity197 : critically ill for five weeks , @entity10 makes us think of how we want to die
@entity195 : there *'s* an epidemic of people suffering as they die *hooked* up to machines
he says we deny death , are scared , do n't want loved ones to go , allow medicine to prolong life
@entity195 : one day you might need to decide when to allow someone you love to die
