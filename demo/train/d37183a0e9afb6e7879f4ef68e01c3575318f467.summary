ever since disgruntled @entity2 declared themselves the 99 % and occupied @entity3 , their protests have been compared to those in the squares of the @entity5 and @entity6 -- especially @entity8 's @entity7 â€” where pro-democracy demonstrations challenged decades of tyrannical power			1
the movements in @entity12 and @entity8 share some characteristics , but direct comparisons between them discredit @entity17 ' tremendous struggles and sacrifices and squeeze the @entity19 into a framework that does not fit			1
i had the fortunate opportunity to cover @entity24 's mass protests in @entity7 and @entity12 ' takeover of @entity26 and can say confidently that the two movements differ in many ways			1
it is true that @entity12 's @entity26 -- like @entity7 -- has been enclosed by barricades and surrounded by police			0
like the @entity24 , @entity12 's protesters are determined to push forward their demands , especially through the use of social media			1
they 're staying put 24 hours a day , defying the orders of authorities ; they 're creating medical and media corners , arts projects and musical performances and debating strategies			1
some @entity24 activists have even advised protesters on @entity3			1
however , @entity44 is no @entity7			2
in @entity24 , demands were clear : president @entity46 had to go			2
even after the 30 - year president stepped down , demands remained focused on the regime			0
protesters called for @entity46 and high - ranking officials to be held accountable , for a new constitution written by the people , for the military to hand over power to a civilian rule and for free and fair elections			0
the occupy movement has clear frustrations with corporate greed , unregulated banks and the housing crisis			0
protesters are disappointed in president @entity63 and his administration for bailing out the banks and " not the people			0
" they have dozens of other grievances and continue to debate strategy and priority			0
but these demands do not call for clear solutions			0
unlike @entity24 , where removing a decades - long presidency was a major success , in the @entity2 , there are n't any high - profile figures to remove that will satisfy the protesters , not even temporarily			1
not one @entity44 protester is risking his or her life to publicly proclaim their demands			2
in @entity12 , police resorted to pepper spray and clubbings ; in @entity86 , @entity87 , police sprayed tear gas and are seen in videos apparently throwing stun grenades			0
protesters display serious wounds they say were inflicted by rubber bullets			0
but even that excessive force can not compare to the threat demonstrators in the @entity5 and @entity6 faced for displaying their dissatisfaction			0
under the guise of emergency law , @entity24 police were given legal backing to crush peaceful protests			1
during the first 18 days of the @entity24 revolution , police and other state security organizations killed at least 840 people and injured thousands , according to @entity105			1
protesters knew that they could die demanding democracy			0
it was a sacrifice they were willing to make , one that @entity2 have not had to consider			2
in stark contrast , protesters in @entity12 consider rank - and - file police officers to be members of the 99 %			0
in @entity24 , the police forces were following direct orders from the leaders who were seen as the enemy			1
@entity12 's protesters can not make that same link between @entity120 officers and the banks ' billionaire @entity121			0
at times , protesters have marched to local @entity127 and @entity128 branches , but even then , they are not directing their frustrations toward bank employees , who they also see as members of the " bottom 99			0
" blaming the banks is rather new in the @entity2 , while in @entity24 ; dissatisfaction with @entity46 and the previous presidents has always existed			1
many @entity2 have been hurt by the economy			2
unemployment and homelessness remains high , and more than 1 million people lost their homes in 2010			0
this has created poverty in the @entity2 , but nothing like @entity24 's			1
roughly 40 % of all @entity24 live on less than $ 2 a day and have lived this way for a long time			2
the @entity24 ' sense of having nothing to lose in the fight for change far eclipses that feeling in the @entity2 the anti-bank movements have spread , but unless more @entity2 believe they too have nothing to lose , the protests can lose steam and fail at convincing the majority of @entity2 that the movement represents them			1
@entity153 , winds and below - freezing temperatures will not skip @entity26			0
the will of the protesters will be tested in a way @entity17 revolutions had n't dealt with			2
@entity2 's protesters found inspiration from @entity17 uprisings , but their needs and desires are distinct from those striving for change half a world away			1
@entity44 will grow and succeed on its own merits .			1

@entity169 : @entity19 likened to @entity24 , but this *overlooks* @entity17 ' *extreme* sacrifices
*similarities* in use of social media , he says , in camps and *defiance* of authorities
@entity169 : @entity44 will grow and succeed on its own merits .
police used violence in @entity2 protests , he writes , but *hundreds* of @entity24 died
