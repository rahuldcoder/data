talk about gender transitioning may be swirling around @entity2 , but the 1976 olympic gold medalist has kept quiet			1
who can blame him ? though the mainstream is increasingly aware of the various ways some people are modifying their gender presentations -- even in our @entity11 , reality - show age -- it remains rare for people to do their transitioning in public			1
it 's even more uncommon for someone already in the public eye to go through the process			1
if the rumors are true , @entity21 may become an exception			1
his mother , @entity24 , recently spoke to @entity26 about hobbies he intends to continue enjoying ; " family sources " and " an insider " have spoken to @entity29 and @entity30 magazine , respectively , providing droplets of gossip about @entity21			2
that part is no surprise			2
@entity21 's ex-wife , @entity39 , is the matriarch of the @entity41 clan -- no strangers to growing up and showing off in public			2
however , while @entity21 and @entity39 ' daughter @entity41 have both publicly offered strong support for @entity2 , neither has used the words " transgender " or " transitioning " with the media			1
@entity0 's repeated attempts to get comment from @entity21 , his agents and his mother have gone unanswered			2
@entity54 , which runs " keeping up with the @entity55 " and is reportedly working on a documentary with @entity21 , has told @entity0 " we 're still not commenting			2
" and @entity21 himself has said nothing publicly			0
even the decathlon winner 's website , @entity61 , consists of a cover page with a generic photo of runners at the starting line , a reference to him as " the world 's greatest athlete " ( as @entity71 decathlon winners are sometimes called ) and a small note that content is " coming soon			0
" he reportedly does have an interview with @entity76 in the works			0
there are a handful of relatively well - known people who have transitioned			1
they have also remained private during the process			1
here are a few examples			0
@entity84 as @entity85 , @entity84 was a successful eye surgeon and , in her younger days , a highly regarded amateur tennis player			0
her transition was carried out in private but became very public when she was outed by a @entity90 tv reporter after a mid- ' 70s tennis tournament , which prompted the @entity92 to ban her from the @entity93			0
as @entity95 wrote in a 2011 @entity97 profile , " until that moment , she had no intention of playing in the @entity93			1
until that moment , @entity84 , already a well - respected eye surgeon , insists she had never really dreamed of a professional tennis career			1
" @entity84 won the right to play in the @entity93 -- she lost the 1977 doubles final -- and became a sought - after coach , most notably with @entity103			1
a documentary about her life , " @entity84 , " premiered in 2011			0
@entity106 the older of the @entity106 siblings , creators of the " @entity109 " trilogy and the newly released " @entity110 , " began modifying her gender presentation in the early 2000s			1
during @entity106 's transformation , friends and representatives publicly denied that the process was underway			1
as late as 2007 , when the @entity106 were making " @entity118 , " columnist @entity117 quoted producer @entity119 as saying , " it 's all untrue			0
" the insular @entity106 had a no - press clause in their studio contract , so the chatter was not confirmed by the pair themselves			1
@entity106 came out as transgender in public in 2012			0
the pair was the subject of a major @entity131 profile in september 2012			1
" my biggest fears were all about losing my family			0
once they accepted me , everything else has been a piece of cake , " @entity106 told the magazine			0
" i know that many people are dying to know if i have a surgically constructed vagina or not , but i prefer to keep this information between my wife and me			1
" @entity142 the child of @entity144 came out as a lesbian in 1995			0
in 2008 , he began his gender transition , a process that was noted by his publicist in 2009			1
@entity150 's transition was the subject of a film , " becoming @entity142 , " in 2011			1
since then , @entity150 is probably best known for competing on " @entity153			0
" he stays active in the entertainment business , promoting his weight loss on " the doctors " and appearing in the forthcoming film " @entity159			0
" @entity160 one of the acting @entity161 -- sibling of @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165 -- had roles in such films as " @entity168 " and " @entity169 " before transitioning in the early 2000s			2
the experience was the subject of a 2007 film , " @entity160 : she 's @entity173			2
" since then , @entity160 has appeared in the tv series " @entity175 " and the films " @entity178 , " " @entity176 " and " blended			0
" @entity160 has said she wants the focus to be on her art , not her body			0
" when people ask me about my privates , i say : ' unless you want to have sex with me , there 's no point asking me			2
unless you want to discriminate against me , i do n't know why it would be an issue , ' " she told @entity189 's @entity188 in january			0
" why would you treat someone differently ? you 're gon na hold the door for me just because i have a vagina ? it 's nice to hold the door for everyone			0
