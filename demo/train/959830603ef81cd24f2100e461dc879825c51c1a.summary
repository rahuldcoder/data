-- the @entity2 billionaires list , seemingly designed to stroke the egos of the world 's richest people , has pricked one of them in painful fashion , alleging that @entity10 " systematically exaggerates " his wealth			1
hours after the @entity14 investor announced that he was " severing ties " with the benchmark of billionaires ' bragging rights , the magazine published a lengthy investigation into his net worth			1
@entity2 ' estimate , up $ 2bn in the last year to $ 20bn , stands $ 9.6bn below the prince 's own estimate			1
almost all of the gap , it said , stems from a starkly lower assessment of his 95 per cent stake in @entity30 , which houses his investments in assets including @entity34 hotels , @entity33 and @entity35 noting steep jumps in the stock before publication of the last four @entity2 lists , the magazine said @entity45 's valuation " rises and falls based on factors that , coincidentally , seem more tied to the @entity2 billionaires list than fundamentals "			1
the magazine added that no other billionaire lobbies as hard as the prince does to affect his or her ranking			2
prince @entity52 's office reacted angrily to the " completely unsupported and biased allegation based on rumours that stock manipulation ' is the national sport ' in @entity14 " , describing it on tuesday night as an insult to @entity14 regulators			1
retail investors dominate the @entity14 stock market -- the biggest exchange in the @entity63 world -- and investors say local rumours often drive share price movements rather than company fundamentals or public announcements			2
yet of all the @entity71 stock market regulators , @entity14 's @entity69 is seen as the most powerful			2
" the market is regarded as one of the strictest regulated in the @entity71 , they have cracked down in the past , " says one @entity73 - based analyst			0
the questions surrounding @entity77 as the country edges forward with plans to open the stock market to foreigners			0
currently , international investors can only buy @entity14 stocks through equity swaps			2
scrutiny of @entity45 could be the first test for the new head of the @entity69 , @entity89 , a former lawyer who was appointed president of the regulator last month			0
@entity92 , which replaced @entity93 as auditor to @entity45 after the 2010 audit , had no comment			0
@entity45 said it had had no disputes with @entity93 and noted that @entity14 requires public companies to change auditor every three years			0
@entity99 , which launched a competing billionaires ranking last year , puts the prince 's net worth at $ 28bn			1
but it also applied a " confidence rating " of three stars out of five to its valuation -- as it often does in countries " where transparent information is often unreliable "			0
