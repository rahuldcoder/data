-- @entity2 director @entity1 has resigned from his position with the club and their parent company @entity5 in the wake of a foul - mouthed e-mail rant at a fan			1

@entity1 subsequently apologized but he has now quit the club			1
the @entity20 fans ' group , who are committed to the removal of @entity9 co-owners @entity24 and @entity25 , had called for @entity1 to resign			2
however , with his father as co-owner it appeared there would be little pressure from the top to do so			0
@entity1 was seen as a key player on @entity34 's board -- comprised of @entity1 and his father , @entity25 and his son @entity36 and managing director @entity37			2
at the same time @entity2 announced his departure , they revealed a re-structuring of the boardroom of both club and @entity5			2
@entity43 , executive vice-president of @entity44 , is the man brought in to replace @entity1 while @entity2 's chief financial officer @entity45 and the club 's commercial director @entity46 are have also both been elected to both companies			1
@entity37 , @entity45 and @entity46 have played increasingly important roles in the last few months as they work towards putting the club on a healthier financial footing			0
that has already led to the signing of a new shirt sponsorship deal with @entity55 worth around $ 120 million			0
one of @entity37 's priorities since taking over from @entity57 in june last year has been to find new investment in the club as they seek to get the funding in place to build a new stadium			0
