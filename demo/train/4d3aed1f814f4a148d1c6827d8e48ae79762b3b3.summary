-- @entity1 ripped apart @entity3 title rivals @entity2 to take top spot in @entity5 with an emphatic 5 - 0 home victory in the first " @entity7 " of the season on monday night			1
real coach @entity9 suffered an embarrassing first defeat since taking over in may as defending champions @entity1 moved two points clear after 13 games following the @entity15 side 's fifth successive win over the capital outfit			1
the visitors were rocked from the outset as @entity19 and @entity20 put @entity22 's team 2 - 0 up inside 20 minutes , then @entity23 scored twice in four second - half minutes to effectively end the game before @entity26 's late goal just rubbed salt in @entity2 's wounds			1
that led to @entity2 defender @entity30 being sent off after clattering into @entity31 and then shoving @entity1 captain @entity32 to the floor as passions boiled despite the cold , pouring rain			1
was this the greatest @entity7 of all time ? " one team played to their potential and one did n't , " @entity9 told @entity38 after a miserable return to one of his former clubs			0
" it was a defeat that we fully deserved but i do n't think you can say it reflected the difference between the two sides			0
" the championship is n't over today			0
we are two points behind the leaders but there are lots of games left to play			0
we have to show character , train hard and get back to winning			0
i wish we were playing tomorrow			0
" the most highly - anticipated match of the @entity60 season , it was a tempestuous affair that saw nine players booked before then , while @entity63 pushed @entity22 away on the touchline and @entity65 escaped an apparent elbow in the face of @entity31			0
@entity31 could not add to his hat - trick in the 8 - 0 thrashing of @entity70 two weekends ago , but was a constant threat to a flimsy @entity2 defense and he set up both of @entity75 's goals			1
@entity63 is @entity5 's top scorer with 15 after a treble last time out , but he was totally overshadowed by @entity78 's world player of the year and was reduced to speculative long - range free - kick attempts			2
@entity1 's key midfielders @entity19 and @entity81 dominated possession , forcing @entity9 to take off one of his star signings , @entity86 's @entity85 playmaker @entity84 , at the halftime break			2
can @entity5 steal @entity90 's @entity89 thunder ? @entity31 hit the post as early as the sixth minute with a delightful flick , and @entity19 opened the scoring four minutes later as he cleverly controlled a slide pass from @entity81 with his heel and guided a volley over goalkeeper @entity97			0
the @entity2 captain was caught out in the 18th minute as he let @entity75 's low cross slip through his hands to give @entity20 an easy chance to make it 2 - 0 from close range			1
the match threatened to boil over after half an hour when @entity63 pushed @entity22 when the coach refused to give him the ball when it went out , resulting in @entity1 keeper @entity106 charging out of his area as players from both teams clashed			2
@entity63 and @entity106 were both yellow - carded for their part in the melee , then @entity23 and @entity2 defender @entity113 followed them into the referee 's book by the 36th minute			1
@entity7 the key to the title says @entity63 @entity31 was also cautioned just before halftime after he went to ground following an incident with @entity65 -- television replays showed that the @entity124 defender was lucky not to be sent off after raising his arm into the @entity127 's face			0
@entity9 brought defensive midfielder @entity128 on at halftime , but just 10 minutes later @entity75 made it 3 - 0 as he beat the offside trap to collect @entity31 's clever throughball			1
the @entity133 striker doubled his tally in the 58th minute with a calm finish with the outside of his right foot after a superb diagonal pass from @entity31 left the @entity2 defense in tatters			2
@entity9 responded by replacing leftback @entity141 with fellow defender @entity143 , before @entity65 was booked for handling when @entity20 seemed set to run free on @entity97 ' goal			0
@entity30 was yellow - carded in the 73rd minute , and received his marching orders soon after @entity26 beat him to a teasing low cross by fellow replacement @entity147 to make it 5 - 0 in time added on .			1

@entity1 claim first place in @entity5 with 5 - 0 *demolition* of previous leaders
defending champions move two points clear as striker @entity23 scores twice
@entity9 suffers his first defeat since taking charge of @entity2
visitors have @entity30 sent off at the end as tempers boil over at @entity165
