-- @entity1 on monday officially inaugurated the centerpiece of its decade - long construction boom , with the surprise revelation that the world - beating 168 - story skyscraper -- seen by some as a symbol of the city 's economic excess -- was even bigger than previously thought			1
in a glitzy firework - lit ceremony , the city - state 's ruler @entity11 unveiled a plaque commemorating the event and also announced that the $ 1.5 billion structure has a new name : the @entity19			1
named after @entity20 , the president of the @entity21 -- and ruler of @entity23 , which recently bailed out debt - ridden @entity1 to the tune of $ 10 billion -- the tower was officially recorded as 828 meters tall , adding 10 meters on to previous height claims			1
six years in the making , and now 319 meters higher than previous skyscraping record - holder @entity31 , @entity1 's newest edifice commands dizzying views of the ambitious building program that has transformed the emirate			1
the structure 's architects , @entity38 - based @entity37 , have called the @entity19 " a bold global icon that will serve as a model for future urban centers			2
" declaring that " tall buildings are back , " the company predicts that the groundbreaking techniques it used to push the @entity19 to new heights should enable the construction of even taller towers in the future			0
@entity49 : share your photos of the world 's tallest buildings " as with any project , @entity37 's architects and engineers learned a great deal and are ready to apply this to the next world 's tallest building as it is certainly possible to go taller , " it said			2
despite such lofty claims , the @entity19 -- and other construction projects including the @entity64 and @entity66 archipelagos of man - made islands built for the super-rich -- have cast a financial shadow over @entity1			1
last year the emirate shocked investors by asking for a freeze on payments owed on its $ 26 billion in debts			0
the announcement by @entity77 -- an umbrella group which includes the @entity19 's developers -- delivered a cold dose of reality to speculators worldwide who believed the oil - rich region was impervious to the global financial crisis			1
facts and figures : why @entity1 is looking up while predicted economic recovery are likely to help @entity1 to shake off some of its debt woes , if not fully regain its boom - time ebullience , some say the city 's path of prestige over practicality will leave projects like the @entity19 struggling to justify their place in the @entity100 state 's skyline			1
" @entity1 does n't really need to have to build tall asides from prestige purposes , " @entity103 , author of " @entity104 : @entity1 and the @entity106 " told @entity0 in a recent interview			0
" if you look at it , it 's a really bad idea			0
it uses as much electricity as an entire city			0
and every time the toilet is flushed they 've got to pump water half a mile into the sky , " he said			2
the telescopic shape also presents problems of a more practical nature @entity103 says			0
" the upper 30 or 40 floors are so tiny that they 're useless , so they ca n't use them for anything else apart from storage			0
they 've built a small , not so useful storage warehouse half a mile in the sky , " he said			2
@entity0 's @entity127 and @entity128 contributed to this story .			0
