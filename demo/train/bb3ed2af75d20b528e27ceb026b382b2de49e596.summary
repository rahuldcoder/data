@entity0 , @entity1 -- driving across the stark @entity1 desert at 75 miles an hour , you do n't expect to find much			1
@entity6 mountains tower above scrubby brown plains with only hints of scattered green			2
sometimes , a tumbleweed , like a lost extra from an old @entity12 movie , skips across the road			2
then , off in the distance , i see something shiny			2
more than shiny ; it is positively gleaming			2
this is my first glimpse of what is billed as the largest solar cell field in the country			1
it is hard to say if the claim is true , since these things are being built so quickly in so many places now			0
but it is impressive : row after row after row of black glass panels tilted toward the sun , quietly soaking energy from the sky			1
" right now , we have about a million panels , " says @entity33 with @entity34 , a @entity35 - based energy resources company			1
" this facility will power about 14,000 average homes on an annual basis			0
" and that 's just the start			0
@entity34 has big designs on being a major player in the green energy game			1
but as the wind whips through my hair and i study the immense emptiness all around , i ca n't help but ask , " why is this such a good location for such a thing ? " " first , there is a lot of available , flat land , " @entity33 says			0
" second , it is incredibly sunny			0
this region gets about 330 days of sunshine per year			0
and third , there 's existing transmission lines which provide access to major markets throughout the western @entity62			0
" which , as is so often the case , raises another question : why are those lines way out here ? to find that answer , you have to drive 20 minutes to struggling @entity0 , population about 16,000			1
the town is uniquely poised to cash in on the new energy boom precisely because it was built on old energy technology ; during another time when the economy and energy collided ; when thousands of jobless men came here during the @entity78 to undertake an unprecedented power - generating project			1
" this town is here because it was a federal reservation to build @entity82			1
he 's a member of the city council and has a background in history			0
he has watched his town get hammered by the recession			2
tourists are n't coming to the dam just east of town like they once did			2
the value of local houses has plunged			0
" our local sales tax revenue is down , " he says , shaking his head			2
" that 's a major portion of our budget			0
our property tax revenues are down			1
" but bring up the solar facility and he brightens , because it has opened a gateway from his town 's past into the future			1
the solar plant provided several hundred temporary construction jobs when it was built , and it has created a handful of permanent positions , since			1
more importantly , it is bringing desperately needed money to city coffers			0
fifteen years ago , the town bought up vast amounts of land to protect itself from the sprawling reach of neighboring @entity120			1
as luck would have it , the purchase included all the land around the big transmission lines leading to the dam , and now , they are leasing that property to @entity34 and others who want to tap into them			1
" this year , we 'll get about two - and - a - half million dollars			0
that 's about 11 percent of our city 's general fund budget , " @entity84 says			0
" that 's pretty important money , and we can count on it			0
" they can probably count on more as well			0
back at the solar field , @entity33 makes it clear that this is only the start			1
" there is strong demand for cleaner sources of energy , and we 're going to help fill that niche			2
" @entity34 is not alone			1
@entity1 is aggressively courting more solar firms , convinced that if they can get enough into place , the whole state can benefit from being a major green energy source for neighboring super state @entity35			1
of course , other states such as @entity155 and @entity156 are thinking the same thing			0
for the folks in @entity0 , however , that 's a worry for another day			1
they know their dark days are far from past			0
but right now , the sun is shining , and just as it was when they built the dam so long ago , that 's a start .			0

@entity0 , @entity1 , a small town near the @entity82 , has *declining* tax revenues
a new solar energy field *nearby* brought jobs , leasing fees
@entity34 says rural @entity1 is ideal for *harvesting* large amounts of energy
@entity0 site has about *1,000,000* solar panels
