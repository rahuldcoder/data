after months of infighting within the @entity2 @entity1 , a major faction of the deadly militant group has apparently had enough			1
the @entity5 faction has announced it 's parting ways with the central leadership of the group , known formally as the @entity9 ( @entity9 ) , over ideological differences			1
the breakaway faction had made attempts to convince the @entity9 to give up what it said were " un-islamic " practices , such as attacks in public places , extortion , and kidnappings , and decided to separate from the banned terrorist outfit after these attempts failed , a spokesperson for the newly - formed faction , @entity13 , said in a statement released to the media last week			0
it 's the first split since the @entity9 -- a coalition of militant groups -- was founded in 2007 , seeking to establish its version of sharia law across @entity2			1
analysts say the move has major implications for alliances among @entity36 groups in the region but there 's no guarantee it will lead to less violence			1
the breakaway faction will be led by @entity5 -- also known as @entity41 -- a @entity9 commander based in @entity42 , near @entity2 's border with @entity44 , @entity13 said			1
it 's believed @entity5 will command as many as 2,600 tribesmen , representing around half of the @entity9 's forces , although the exact number is hard to determine due to the many smaller splinter groups with changing names and allegiances in other parts of the country , according to @entity55 , senior fellow at the @entity56 , a @entity2 think tank and consulting editor at @entity59			1
internal conflict tensions within the @entity9 have been brewing for some time			0
they escalated after the group 's leader , @entity63 , was killed in a @entity66 drone strike in november last year , setting off a power struggle among top commanders of the @entity9 that led to violent clashes in recent months in which dozens of people were killed			2
appointed by a tribal council , @entity71 has stood at the helm of the @entity74 since @entity5 's death			2
he hails from the @entity77 valley and is the first @entity9 leader who is not a @entity5			2
he has struggled to contain the internal frictions among the group 's factions , especially those within the @entity83 , which makes up the majority of the @entity9			2
speaking on behalf of the breakaway faction on may 28 , @entity13 said the @entity9 's governing committee had been taken over by " criminals , " accusing the group of taking foreign funding to attack targets in @entity44 and " spreading unfounded propaganda against the @entity44 @entity1			1
" the split is expected by some to weaken the @entity2 @entity1			1
it has been hailed as a success for the @entity2 military , which appears to have adopted a strategy of trying to divide the @entity9 by negotiating with moderate factions , according to @entity98 , director of @entity100 programs at the @entity101 in @entity102 -- although the military has never publicly stated this was its plan			2
" breaking an insurgent faction from within is a time - tested strategy , " @entity98 said			0
some factions of the @entity74 are more willing to end attacks on @entity2 authorities and civilians , in exchange for more autonomy in tribal areas than hardliners , who are determined to implement sharia law across the country			2
@entity71 , who leads the group remotely from @entity44 , is among those fighting for @entity121 law at all costs			0
on may 19 , he said the group would not end its jihad until sharia law was established or they " embrace martyrdom			0
" " the @entity118 is clear on ( its ) objectives to attack @entity2 's army and @entity2 's state , " @entity131 from the @entity56 told @entity127			0
" the @entity132 ( led by @entity5 ) has reservations ( about ) what the military has been doing , but resists the brutal attacks on @entity2 's army			1
" the government began peace talks with the @entity9 earlier this year but they have yet to reach an agreement			0
" i think these recent talks that the government has initiated with the @entity9 have played their part and it 's quite a victory for the @entity144 ( the military 's intelligence agency ) to have played a role in this split , " said @entity131			1
war on terror the ideological rift is also tied to the winding down of @entity66 and @entity153 operations in @entity44 , analysts say			0
" the heart of the reason why the @entity9 came into being was that it opposed @entity2 's alignment with the @entity66 in the war on terror and the presence of @entity66 troops in @entity44 , " said @entity131			0
" now , with the impending @entity153 withdrawal , the impetus for attacks on the @entity2 state is diminishing because the @entity66 has announced it will be leaving the region and of course , that changes the whole context in which ( the @entity9 ) is operating			0
" the question now , says @entity131 , is how @entity168 and other splinter groups will react			1
" @entity168 is likely to be worried about this split because in a unified strong @entity9 they had a very useful partner to capture more power and space in @entity2 , but now they will be feeling a little rattled by these counter-moves by @entity2 's government and military			1
" the secession also comes on the heels of a massive targeted operation in @entity42 by the @entity2 army			0
at least 60 terrorists were killed in airstrikes in tribal areas this month , the army claims			0
on tuesday , @entity2 's army chief @entity185 announced " together the whole nation has rejected the misplaced ideology of the terrorists , who have clearly lost their cause already and are being marginalized			0

@entity5 faction of @entity2 @entity1 defects , citing ideological differences
the break comes after months of internal friction within the militant group
analysts say the split weakens the @entity1 , government talks played a role
it *remands* to be seen how @entity168 and splinter groups will respond
