@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 and electric vehicles might be leading the charge , so to speak , towards cleaner transport , but will cars powered by air and the sun ever surpass the sales figures of gasoline cars ? @entity12 boss @entity12 with his @entity14 which start a six - month trial at two @entity17 airports in 2009			1
click here to read about the latest hydrogen and electric cars a breath of @entity22 it might seem ridiculous , but air -- yes , air -- can power a car			1
compressed air , stored in a carbon - fiber tank and then released , expands to drive the engine 's pistons in the same way that petrol gases do			1
a @entity32 - based company , @entity12 ( @entity12 ) is at the forefront of the air car 's push to market			1
former @entity38 engineer and @entity12 founder @entity12 has been working on the technology for almost two decades and is producing a fleet of different models including the @entity44 , the @entity45 and the @entity46			0
@entity48 's biggest car maker , @entity49 , and a @entity51 startup , @entity12 , have both signed deals with @entity12 and hope to have air cars on the road by 2010			1
in the @entity51 the starting price will be nearly $ 18,000			1
in october 2008 , @entity57 and the @entity59 airline @entity58 announced that they will be testing out @entity12 's " @entity14 " for six months starting in spring 2009			0
the four seaters will ferry passengers around @entity62 in @entity63 and @entity64 in @entity64			0
@entity12 says one tank of compressed air will take you about 60 miles in the @entity44 , which has a top speed of 35 miles per hour			2
as you 'd expect from a car that runs on air , there is zero pollution			1
verdict compressed - air engines are not new technology -- the @entity77 were powering trams with compressed air back in the 19th century			1
but the air car is highly unlikely to surpass the gasoline car and does n't have enough oomph to seriously challenge new electric and fuel - cell vehicles			1
@entity85 , an electrical engineer from the @entity87 's @entity86 , says : " they are interesting , but the problem is that the specific energy -- energy per unit mass -- is very high in air cars			1
" professor @entity93 from the @entity94 at the @entity87 's @entity95 says : " it 's an idea that 's worth pursuing , but compressing air is both a strength and a weakness			2
the big advantage of conventional engines is that you can put fuel with a high energy content in a tank and get good range			0
with a compressed air engine the range is not spectacular			1
" @entity109 solar cars harvest sunlight to drive an on - board electric motor			1
you 're probably familiar with the solar cars that look a bit like a stingray on wheels , but those are n't commercially viable and are mostly entered into endurance races like the annual @entity120 in @entity121			1
a @entity77 motor company , @entity122 , has produced an electro - solar hybrid			1
the @entity124 -- a car with roof - mounted solar panels which power an electric motor -- was so popular , @entity122 says , that they have adapted it into a commercial model			1
the @entity130 is yours to own for $ 30,000 and uses solar panels to collect energy to power an electric engine			1
it has a range of about 30 miles and has a top speed of 30 mph			0
the car is featured in the 2008 movie , " @entity139 , " starring @entity140			2
it is rumored that the @entity142 -- which passed the one million worldwide sales mark in 2008 -- has a new model due out next year that will be fitted with solar panels on its roof to power the car 's air conditioning			1
verdict @entity122 has demonstrated that it is perfectly possible to produce solar powered vehicles			2
but they are expensive when you consider the level of performance they can deliver			0
professor @entity93 says : " solar power has a long way to go			2
at the moment you simply do n't have the energy density to do anything special			0
" but @entity85 thinks that solar could assist the growth of electric cars			1
" your garage could have solar panels on its roof , store up energy during the day and charge your vehicle at night , " he said			2
" and parking lots and the like could be fitted with solar panels			2
so there are ways that those two can play together			0
" the future @entity178 , @entity179 at the @entity180 in @entity181 , says : " we are talking about a new paradigm here because we know the old paradigm is going to go away			0
" for hydrogen , or any new fuel for that matter , to succeed there has to be a policy decision			0
at the moment it 's not cost effective and it 's not going to be cost effective until we get into the tens of millions of units per year			0
there is no way of getting around this			0
politicians have to decide when they want to put a policy in place			0
it 's not an economic decision , it 's a policy decision			0
" but any major changes are going to take a long time , he says			0
" the issue is manufacturing			0
last year we made 60 million cars worldwide			2
that 's two cars a second			2
that 's the current level of production			0
it has taken many years to get up to that rate , " @entity178 said			0

is the gas engine about to be overtaken by a host of cleaner , leaner rivals ?
cars running on air are expected to be on sale in the @entity51 and @entity48 by 2010
@entity77 motor company has developed a solar car roof that powers an electric motor
