the videos taken by citizens of @entity2 during wednesday 's attack on the offices of @entity5 indicate significant training on the part of terrorists			1
here are some things any military professional would observe : the uniform : all the attackers are uniform in appearance			0
all have vests capable of holding multiple magazines of ammunition for their weapons , and perhaps grenades			0
additionally , they are all wearing what appear to be heavy coats			0
that could indicate either body armor or possibly suicide vests underneath to be detonated if captured			0
some experts are suggesting " they came to kill , not to die , " but those of us with experience in these kinds of encounters might suggest they came to kill until they are trapped -- then they will willingly die if they can kill more by detonating a suicide vest as a last resort			0
use of weapons : the terrorists were wielding @entity36 , according to police spokesman @entity37 , but at least one of them also appeared to have a military 3 - point sling attached to the weapon ( the white strap going over the shoulder )			1
these slings are used in close - in attacks			1
the driver does not appear to have this strap , which allows for freedom in the car			0
the attackers appear to be good marksmen , as evidenced by the tight shot of a group of bullets that riddled the windshield of a @entity54 police car , shown in several photographs at the scene			0
additionally , the attackers have their weapons on semi-automatic ( single shot ) versus full automatic			0
many terrorists use what @entity63 soldiers derisively call the " pray and spray " method			2
that is , they point their weapons on full automatic , scream a religious slogan and let loose with a stream of bullets -- most of which do n't hit the targets			0
these terrorists appear well - trained , with aimed fire , single shots and controlled targeting			1
fire and maneuver : these terrorists appear to have been trained in movement techniques : they use cover ( parked automobiles , or an open car door ) and aim fire while their terrorist " buddy " maneuvers to a new firing location			2
at that point , the moving terrorist aims and fires , while the previously covering terrorist moves to join him			0
reconnaissance : the attack occurred at noon in busy @entity2 , yet there was no traffic on the side streets where the citizens ' filming took place			1
additionally , initial reports indicate that an editors ' meeting was occurring at that time , with all the subjects in one room			0
that indicates there was intelligence , route planning and then individual requirements for the members of the terrorist team			1
speed : they moved fast , knew where they are going , did their job , and then they were gone			2
again , that 's indicative of rehearsals but also single - mindedness of mission			1
selection of target : this was a follow - on attack			1
the offices of @entity5 had been previously firebombed , but that attack was not successful			1
much like the initial @entity129 bombing in 1993 that was followed by the 2001 attack , these terrorists were again going after the same target			1
usually , terrorists film their attacks for future information operations and social media use			2
they may have had terrorist videographers in specific locations for that purpose during this attack as well			2
those videos may appear in the future , but until then @entity54 citizens posting @entity144 videos contribute to the terrorists ' information campaign			1
in the next few hours and days , other countries of @entity148 -- especially @entity149 and @entity150 -- will be interested in sharing information from this attack , as they face similar threats from @entity155 extremists			2
@entity54 , the @entity156 and @entity157 will share information , and given the ability of the terrorists to move freely through @entity148 , this passing of information will be critical			0
the passport - free @entity164 allows for movement through 26 countries in @entity148 on the motorways and autobahns , so while initially this is an attack on @entity54 , these terrorists are a threat to all of @entity148 .			1

videos show speed , preparation by terrorists in @entity2 attack , @entity173 says
attack 's timing indicates intelligence and route planning on part of terror team , @entity173 says
@entity173 calls it a follow - on attack after earlier firebombing on @entity5 failed
