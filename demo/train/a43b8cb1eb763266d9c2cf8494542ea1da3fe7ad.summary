-- my friend @entity1 was into yoga long before it went mainstream , and she was good at it			1
she attended yoga camps , went on a yearly trek to @entity8 and even ritually cleansed her sinuses with warm saltwater -- literally sucked it up through her nose			1
she claimed it possessed a healing value and kept her from getting a cold			2
that was the ' 70s			2
she tried to convince me back then that yoga would be good for me , that it would loosen up my muscles and increase my body 's longevity			1
i wanted nothing to do with it			2
" are you kidding ? " i said			2
" i ca n't stand still for two minutes , and you want me to do yoga ? " yoga : tap into the many health benefits i loved running and playing sports like soccer and volleyball , things that kept me moving all the time			1
the idea of stretching did n't really appeal to me			1
neither , for that matter , did sucking saltwater into my nose			0
twenty - five years went by , and lo and behold , i found that my body was getting more and more prone to injury , just like @entity1 predicted			1
the breaking point came six years ago , when i injured my hamstring at the beginning of @entity41 in @entity42 and ended up walking 21 miles to finish the race in six hours and 14 minutes			0
not exactly the kind of record i had been hoping to set			0
i figured if i wanted to keep being able to run , i had better learn how to stand still			0
fortunately , i learned that there are different flavors of yoga			1
i tried @entity49 at first , and i can definitely see the appeal -- it 's a slower , more meditative practice , good for feeling centered and grounded			1
but @entity49 also uses a lot of props , and i did n't like that kind of interruption			1
it made it harder for me to get into a rhythm			0
then one day i was working out at my gym when i noticed a class doing a very different kind of yoga -- power yoga , or @entity64			1
no props , no time wasted , and the people were in constant motion			0
granted , it was a more " sedentary " motion , if you will -- a series of poses like @entity72 -- but they switched from one to the other so fast it felt like a real workout			0
in fact , the only thing i did n't like about @entity64 was that the pace really wore me out			1
turns out that the 30 - something yoga students were in better shape than the @entity82			1
why you really should get ' fit by 40 ' over time , i 've improved -- and not just physically			0
sure , my muscles feel looser than they have in years , and i 'm avoiding injuries as i grow older			2
my teacher , @entity87 , even tells me that my poses are improving			0
there 's more than that , though			0
call it a cliche , but yoga really does feed your soul as much as it does your body			1
i 've learned that as much as i love being active and on the go , it really is necessary to take time out of each day to slow down , to forget about your computer , your smartphone and all those e-mails , to take some time away from your kids and your job and your responsibilities			0
to stop moving and focus simply on staying put			0
now , does that mean i 'll start inhaling saltwater sometime soon ? my sinuses are doing just fine without it , thanks			0
but yoga has become a valuable part of my life , and it can do good things for you , too			2
