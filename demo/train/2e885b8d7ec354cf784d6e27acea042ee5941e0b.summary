-- ask anyone from the @entity2 to name a famous swimmer and they will probably say @entity5			0
but put the same question to someone in @entity8 and the name that trips off the tongue is @entity11			1
the 32 - year - old has propelled not only himself but @entity8 swimming into the spotlight in the 21st century thanks to a series of remarkable performances on the global stage , smashing records and scooping multiple world and @entity22 titles			1
his best days in the pool may be behind him but @entity11 's focus remains forward - looking as he builds on his legacy as arguably the greatest breaststroke exponent of all time			1
his goal is to inspire the next generation of champions from the @entity31 ahead of @entity32 's 2020 hosting of the world 's biggest sporting showpiece by getting them started in the pool			1
" i want children to start swimming and have lots of dreams in swimming , " @entity11 tells @entity0 's human to @entity38			1
" i think the best thing about swimming is that anyone from 0 years old to grandpas and grandmas can do it			0
so it 's important to give dreams to children but i 'd also like to let people know the fun of swimming			0
" he set up his swimming club , @entity56 , in 2011 and a quick scroll through his social media accounts shows he 's often personally on hand to inspire an excited audience around the prefectures			0
stroke of genius @entity11 may not possess the physical stature associated with modern swimming champions -- most pros are considerably taller and heavier than his 1.78 - meter , 72.5 - kg ( 160 - pound ) frame -- but that did n't stop him rising above his contemporaries			1
" there have n't been many people in @entity72 who could compete in the world of swimming			0
i proved that we ( @entity8 ) can , " he says			1
@entity11 burst onto the scene as a 17 - year - old , serving notice of his talent with a fourth - place finish in the 100 meters breaststroke final at the @entity82 in 2000			1
buoyed by the experience -- " it gave me confidence , " he says -- @entity11 went on to take gold at the @entity86 in 2002 at the same distance before winning both the 100m and 200m breaststroke at the world championships the following year in @entity91			1
his reputation for performing on the biggest stage was confirmed when he achieved the same double at the @entity95 in 2004			0
after pipping his great @entity2 rival @entity96 in the 100m final , @entity11 let rip with a primal scream of joy before exclaiming " cho kimochi ii ! " -- meaning " i feel really good ! " -- a phrase which he is credited with popularizing in his homeland			1
noises of a different kind were also audible from the @entity2 camp following the race , with @entity96 's teammate @entity107 accusing @entity11 of using an illegal dolphin kick			2
the underwater motion which takes its name from the way dolphins flick their tail up and down was banned in the breaststroke discipline at that time , although swimming 's governing body @entity115 has since relaxed the law , allowing one dolphin kick at the start and on turns			0
there was , however , little controversy about @entity11 's win in the 200m a few days later , with @entity96 having to settle for bronze			2
duel for supremacy the @entity32 native 's rivalry with the @entity2 was one of the great swimming duels of recent times			2
@entity96 got his revenge on @entity133 in subsequent world championships , beating the @entity8 star in the 100m in both 2005 and 2007			2
the pair proved just as hard to separate when it came to world records , with both men treating the 100m and 200m breaststroke world record like a hot potato			0
in total , they broke it a total of 10 times ; that particular duel finished in a dead heat with five records each			0
" every time he set a record , i wanted to break them , " @entity11 recalls			2
" it was such a happy time in my swimming career when i could compete with him			0
" despite being plagued by injuries in the years following @entity159 , @entity11 showed he was still the man to beat when the @entity22 rolled around again in 2008			1
in @entity161 , the then 25 - year - old managed to fend off @entity96 and everyone else to repeat his @entity159 double , becoming the first man in @entity22 history to successfully defend both the 100m and 200m breaststroke titles			1
with his fame now peaking at home , the " @entity11 , " as he was nicknamed , upped sticks and moved to the @entity2 he says relocating to @entity171 helped to prolong his career			2
" i wanted to change my living environment			0
i did n't really miss @entity8 while i was in @entity174			2
i came back to @entity8 when i had a competition and went to @entity174 to train			1
it was a good balance , " he explains			0
" i owe that i can still swim like this to the friends i met in @entity174 and coaches who accepted me to train with them in @entity2			0
" @entity181 , the head coach at the @entity182 who worked with @entity11 , described him as " probably the most efficient breaststroke swimmer i have ever witnessed			1
" but even his superb technique could n't propel the double , double @entity22 champion to a unprecedented triple triumph at @entity187 -- a fifth place in the 100m was his best individual showing			2
despite diminishing returns over the last two years , @entity11 is not thinking about retiring just yet , but now has other things competing for his attention			1
in september 2013 , he married pop star @entity194 -- former lead singer with @entity8 band @entity195 -- who gave birth to their daughter earlier this year			1
but he remains determined to carry on in the pool			0
" i want to compete ( and ) i 'd like to continue being an athlete			0
so as far as people give me support i want to continue , " he says			0
a trip to @entity204 in 2016 may still be on the cards , he hopes , but an appearance at his hometown games in @entity32 in six years ' time is surely out of the question			1
is n't it ? " i 'm not sure whether i will be continuing my career then or not , but i hope i can ( remain a part of ) swimming for a long time , " he says			0
@entity32 2020 maybe a bridge too far , even for the great man , but the future looks bright for @entity72 swimming , he says			2
" the whole of @entity72 is getting stronger now , not just @entity8 but countries such as @entity220 and @entity221 are doing well			2
" in @entity8 we have very strong swimmers who won world competitions			1
i 'm very glad that there are many of them coming out now			0
