-- after @entity3 's estranged husband doused her with industrial - strength lye , doctors saved her life with a medically induced coma and more than 50 surgeries			1

she was so disfigured that children ran away from her			0
when tv news shows did stories about her , they warned that the images might be disturbing and advised viewer discretion			0

then her plastic surgeon at @entity22 in @entity23 made a suggestion			0
he 'd recently done the first facial transplant in the @entity27 , and he thought it might work for her			1
at first the idea sounded a bit strange -- going through life with someone else 's face ? -- but it did n't take long for @entity3 to say yes , and on wednesday , @entity3 unveiled her new face at a press conference			1
she does n't know her deceased donor 's name but said she thinks about her every day			1

in 2011 , @entity62 and his team made headlines when they performed the nation 's first full facial transplant on @entity68 , a @entity69 man who got too close to a high - voltage line while at work			1
@entity3 was approved for a full transplant in december of that year			1
it took about 14 months -- an unusually long time -- to find a donor , because she had so many antibodies in her immune system built up from the blood transfusions and surgeries used to treat her injuries			2
she had the 15 - hour transplant surgery in february , becoming about the sixth person in the @entity27 to get a full facial transplant , according to @entity83			1
an animation of the procedure done by the hospital shows how surgeons removed her skin , muscles , tendons , and nerves , replacing them with those of the donor			0
at first , it did n't go so well			0
@entity3 's body started to reject her new face -- a rejection so strong doctors feared the transplant might fail			1
" we had some sleepless nights , " @entity50 said			0
but a well - tailored cocktail of anti-rejection drugs saved @entity3 's new face			1

emotionally , @entity3 has recovered by forgiving her ex-husband , who 's now in prison , and by giving inspirational talks and publishing a book , " overcome : burned , blinded , and @entity126			1
" in december , she started taking piano lessons from a local teacher named @entity129			0
the lessons were before the transplant , when her face was so badly disfigured , but still he fell in love with her			1
" he was able to see me through my scars , " she said			0
@entity129 helped her through her february transplant and during her recovery			2
at first , she had hardly any control over her face , but she can now muster a bit of a smile , and her doctors say with time she should be able raise her eyebrows and make other facial expressions			2
she especially looks forward to gaining the strength and coordination to kiss the man she calls " the love of my life			1
