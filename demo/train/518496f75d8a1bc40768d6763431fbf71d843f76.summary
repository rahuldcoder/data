a @entity1 man has filed a lawsuit alleging excessive force in a case that involves an officer turning off a dashcam that was recording the man 's arrest			1
at one point in the video from the dashcam , a female officer can be heard saying : " hold up , everybody , hold up			1
we 're red right now so if you guys are worried about cameras just wait			0
" the phrase " we 're red right now " indicates that a camera is recording			0
a second dashcam continued to record			2
video of the april arrest shows officers stopping a vehicle being driven by @entity25 , whose car roughly matched the description of one possibly involved in an area shooting			1
as officers approached the vehicle , they ordered @entity25 and his passenger to show their hands			1
according to the police report , one officer smelled marijuana and saw what looked to be plastic baggies full of a leafy green substance			2
the passenger was ordered from the vehicle , and he was handcuffed without incident			2
@entity25 was also ordered to exit the vehicle , but he refused and became increasingly agitated , according to the report			1
while officers attempted to place him in handcuffs , one saw the handle of a handgun sticking out of @entity25 's right front pocket			1
according to the report , @entity25 was seen reaching for the weapon			1
the video then shows officers kicking @entity25 while he is on the ground			1
according to his suit , @entity25 suffered abrasions to his fingers , face , back , head , ears and neck			1
he was handcuffed after an officer used a taser on him			0
a loaded handgun was later removed from @entity25 's pocket			1
an attorney representing the city and the police department defended the officers ' actions in the arrest , while condemning the officer who turned off the dashcam , which is against department policy			1
" the officers were not acting out of line at any time during the arrest			2
the person involved in this altercation had a semi-automatic gun , and the officers were protecting themselves and the public			2
they did what had to be done to protect themselves , " @entity80 told @entity2			0
he said the use of force and the dashcam issues are separate			2
the officer who shut off the dashcam video was referred to an internal affairs department , @entity80 said			1
" the city 's @entity89 has a policy on the use of dash cameras and other cameras , and the @entity89 special order says the cameras should be left on until the event is concluded			2
when we saw that an officer had violated that policy , it was very disappointing , " he said			0
" the internal affairs recommended discipline for the officer , which is what happened			0
" because the case is still open to appeal , @entity80 declined to say what the punishment was			0
he said the officer , who he identified as @entity110 , remains on the job while her appeal is underway			0
a call to the officer 's lawyer was not returned			0
attorney @entity116 , who represents @entity117 , is urging reform			0
all of the charges against his client have been dismissed			0
according to a statement from @entity1 prosecutor @entity125 , the " action of turning off the dash camera video diminished the evidentiary merits of the case			0
" " i do n't think an officer on the scene should have the capability to stop the camera from rolling			0
otherwise it defeats the entire purpose of having body cameras and / or dashcams , " @entity116 said			0
