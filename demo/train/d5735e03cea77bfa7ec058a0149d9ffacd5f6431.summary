@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is never appetizing			0
not even when it 's wrapped around a chimichanga			2
a political food fight broke out this week when @entity8 columnist @entity7 essentially wrote in a column that the @entity10 had nothing left to offer @entity13 voters other than the chimichanga			1
let me set the table			0
@entity7 was making a point that i 've made dozens of times myself : given the nation 's demographics and the direction they 're headed , the @entity10 is on a suicide mission if it continues to alienate @entity13			1
one way that @entity24 @entity10 were doing that , @entity7 insisted , was by dragging their feet on president @entity27 's nomination of @entity28 to the 11th @entity29			1
on wednesday , the @entity24 finally confirmed him , in a 95 - 4 vote			0
@entity28 will be the first @entity32 - born judge to sit on that bench			0
but for a long time , @entity24 @entity10 seemed intent on preventing that from occurring			1
they filibustered the nomination by doing what senators in both parties do during a filibuster : spouting nonsense for hours on end			0
@entity7 seized on the nonsense that came from sen. @entity43 , @entity44			0
the senator 's remarks really had nothing to do with @entity48			1
" the lettuce in your salad this month almost certainly came from @entity44 , " @entity43 said on the @entity24 floor			0
" it 's also believed that the chimichanga has its origin in @entity44			2
" @entity7 sneered : " the chimichanga ? it may be the only thing @entity10 have left to offer @entity48			1
" that told me that @entity7 's knowledge of @entity48 was a taco short of a combination plate			1
as dysfunctional as the modern - day @entity10 is with regard to immigration -- in large part , because it has basically volunteered to be the party of white @entity71 who are freaked out over shifting demographics -- the @entity10 offers @entity48 quite a bit in other areas			1
for instance , a major reason you have even a sliver of accountability in @entity71 's public schools is because a @entity10 president -- @entity83 -- pushed through the @entity84 , the most important educational reform measure in 50 years			1
what does it tell you that the law is opposed by liberal teachers ' unions but supported by the @entity91 -- the nation 's largest latino advocacy group ? what it tells me is that , when it comes to education reform and a host of other issues , the interests of the @entity97 and its allies are not always in sync with the interests of the @entity13 community			1
republicans also offer @entity48 a full menu of conservative selling points : strong defense , smaller government , lower taxes , pro-life judges and a defense of traditional marriage			1
by the way , as someone who is pro-choice and supports gay marriage , those parts of the @entity10 message do n't work on me			1
but the point is , they do work on @entity48 who are more socially conservative			2
@entity122 , @entity27 's campaign manager , eagerly bit into @entity7 's snarky quote , sending it out in a tweet			1
it 's not like someone such as @entity122 has much else to do , with regard to @entity13 voters			1
the modern @entity97 strategy for @entity13 outreach amounts to simply this : " @entity133 ! vote for us			2
we 're not @entity135 ! " i ca n't blame @entity122 for opportunistically seizing on a quote from someone else that he thinks will make his job easier			0
that is what political operatives do			0
but i do blame @entity7			0
his remark was uninformed and uncalled for			0
latinos can trace their ancestry to a variety of different countries , and they 're not interchangeable			0
@entity148 might mean something to @entity150 or @entity151 , but where does that leave @entity153 , @entity32 , @entity154 , @entity155 and others ? also , it 's never a good idea for someone who is n't @entity13 to presume to know what appeals to @entity48			1
lastly , if it 's not too much to ask , just once i 'd like to not be defined by a food group			2
that 's what @entity165 did when , during the 2008 presidential campaign , she told @entity13 voters gathered in a @entity170 restaurant in @entity171 that the problems of all @entity71 are interconnected despite that " we treat them as though one is guacamole and one is chips			1
" politicians have dished out this tactic for years			0
in his congressional and @entity24 races , @entity180 went into the @entity13 enclaves of south @entity183 and handed out tacos and beer			2
years later , president @entity186 tried to bond with a @entity13 audience by taking a bite out of a tamale			2
@entity190 loved @entity170 food and consumed it with gusto			0
during a visit to a @entity170 restaurant in @entity195 in the late 1990s , @entity190 showed his affinity with @entity13 by eating enough to satisfy an entire @entity170 family			2
no political party is perfect			0
and neither @entity10 nor @entity199 are doing a very good job of serving @entity48 at the moment			1
on the immigration issue , both have failed us			0
but the truth is that , despite what some liberals want @entity48 to believe , the @entity10 offers a lot to that community			1
at moments like this , however , @entity199 offer only sarcasm , insults and condescension			0
it 's enough to give you indigestion			0
follow @entity218 on @entity219 join the conversation on @entity221 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity224			2

@entity224 : a columnist said the only thing the @entity10 has to offer @entity48 is " chimichangas "
when @entity27 's campaign manager tweeted the line , the @entity10 *complained*
@entity224 says the *statement* was wrong ; @entity10 do offer *policies* @entity13 voters like
he says it 's a *bad* idea to tell an ethnic group what you think they should value
