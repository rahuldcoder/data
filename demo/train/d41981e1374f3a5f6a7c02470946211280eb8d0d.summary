-- @entity1 is feeling fearless			1
with her 42nd birthday approaching on august 30 , the actress is dismissing @entity5 's obsession with youth and embracing growing older with pride and an eagerness to try something new			1
" i like being 41			1
i love it , " @entity1 tells @entity10 in its august issue , on sale july 8			1
" so much s * * * just falls away			2
it 's the best age			2
that 's when a woman knows how to work things , or she does n't care about that anymore			1
you just stop being afraid			2
you do n't worry about what men think			2
you just do n't worry that time registers anything awful			2
" perhaps it 's that perspective that helped lead @entity1 to the july 18 comedy " @entity32 , " in which she and @entity26 play a couple who accidentally share a home video of their intimate moments for all to see			1
obviously , neither @entity1 nor @entity26 could be shy about showing some skin with a plot like that , but in fact , @entity1 is n't just showing some skin			1
" it 's a first for me , " she says of the nude work in the comedy			1
" but @entity26 ( @entity26 ) gets naked , too			2
it 's just a part of the role			2
i mean , you see everything			0
" while @entity1 is still conquering career firsts , in her personal life she 's content with where she is			1
when the topic veers toward her decision not to have kids , @entity1 explains , " it 's so much more work to have children			1
" " to have lives besides your own that you are responsible for -- i did n't take that on , " the actress continues			0
" that did make things easier for me			0
a baby -- that 's all day , every day for 18 years			0
not having a baby might really make things easier , but that does n't make it an easy decision			0
" i like protecting people , but i was never drawn to being a mother			0
i have it much easier than any of them			0
that 's just what it is			0
does n't mean life is n't sometimes hard			0
i 'm just what i am			0
i work on what i am			1
" right now , i think , things are good for me			0
i 've done a lot			0
and i do n't care anymore			0
