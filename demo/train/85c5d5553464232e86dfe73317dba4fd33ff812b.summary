-- @entity3 's security forces have been guilty of serious human rights abuses in their efforts to crack down on the militant @entity7 group @entity6 , @entity1 said thursday in a new report			1
the report paints an ugly picture of spiraling violence , where brutal attacks carried out by @entity6 , often against civilians , are countered by the security forces with abuses that only add to the problem , the rights group said			1
read more about @entity6 on @entity0 's @entity19 blog @entity6 has become increasingly sophisticated in its methods in the past three years , the report said , carrying out deadly attacks across northern and central @entity3			1
some of the most notorious have targeted @entity24 churches , causing hundreds of deaths ; markets and schools have also been bombed or burned down in attacks claimed by @entity6			2
" the attacks targeting civilians may constitute crimes against humanity , " the report said			0
read more : opinion : @entity3 is a sinking ship , but we must not desert it however , the abuses by @entity6 do not absolve the government of its responsibility to live up to its obligations under the law , the report said -- something @entity1 alleges it is failing to do			1
a spokesman for the @entity3 military , col. @entity46 , rejected the allegations in comments to @entity0			2
" we sincerely disagree with the report released by @entity1 , " he said			0
" we believe that their statistical data is unfounded			0
they did n't interview anybody from @entity6 , and they did n't interview us ; they seemed to have just spoken to people on the street			0

what would we gain from killing people like that ? we do n't torture , we interrogate			0
if they are found not to be members of @entity6 , we release them immediately , take them back to where we picked them up and we apologize , " he said			0
read more : why @entity3 are no longer content with ' suffering and smiling ' the report , based on visits by @entity1 researchers to northern @entity80 and @entity82 states and the @entity83 this year as well as past trips and other research , details a catalog of violent acts that have helped to create a climate of fear in the worst affected areas			2
@entity6 , whose name means " @entity99 education is forbidden , " is fighting to impose a strict version of @entity95 law in the northern part of the country			0
while condemning the grave abuses committed by @entity6 , @entity1 said @entity3 's security forces " have perpetrated serious human rights violations " in their response			1
read more : @entity3 arrests a suspected militant leader " hundreds of people accused of links to @entity6 have been arbitrarily detained without charge or trial ; others have been extrajudicially executed or subjected to enforced disappearance , " the report said			1
" at the same time , the @entity3 government has failed to adequately prevent or investigate the attacks or to bring perpetrators to justice ; and victims have not received prompt and adequate reparation and remedy			2
" the cycle of attacks and counter-attacks has been marked by unlawful violence on both sides with devastating consequences for the human rights of the people trapped in the middle			0
" @entity1 said it had shared its findings with the @entity3 authorities in advance as well as requesting further information on certain cases , but that it had received no response			2
its researchers met with senior government officials , including the ministers for police affairs , justice and the interior , and the defense headquarters representative , the group said			2

in addition , researchers spoke with survivors of attacks by @entity6 and relatives of those killed by suspected members of the group as well as those detained by the security forces and their families			1
in @entity166 , in @entity82 , where many of the deaths have occurred , @entity1 researchers found residents are reluctant to speak out over @entity6 abuses for fear of reprisals			1
at the same time , " the climate of fear and insecurity has forced many journalists , lawyers and human rights defenders to scale down or stop their activities , or flee the area entirely			0
" residents told @entity1 that police and security forces appeared to do little to investigate or prosecute killings by suspected militants			1
of those arrested , most languish in detention , and only a small number have been convicted , the report said			0
opinion : could it finally be springtime for @entity3 ? investigations have also rarely been carried out in alleged abuses by the security forces , leading to a loss of public confidence in the authorities , the report said			1
in one example cited in the report , " witnesses interviewed by @entity1 described seeing people who were clearly no threat to life -- unarmed , lying down or with their hands over their head or cooperating -- shot at close range by the security forces			1
" @entity1 also points out the challenges faced by a police force that is poorly resourced , with some officers lacking bulletproof vests or handcuffs , and has itself been a frequent target of attacks by @entity6			1
" the failure of the government to properly equip and train the police reduces their ability to ensure their own and other people 's safety			0
hundreds of police , military and @entity150 ( @entity150 ) have been killed by @entity6 since 2009			1
they have been shot and blown up in their stations , at roadblocks and in their homes , " the report said			0
opinion : why are @entity3 numb to slaughter ? the rights group makes a series of recommendations , with specific points addressed to president @entity233 , the ministries of defense and justice as well as the police , security services and lawmakers			1
they include strengthening systems and training to ensure abuses are not carried out by security forces , and greater efforts to investigate abuse allegations and ensure the safety of witnesses			1
@entity3 has almost equal numbers of @entity24 and @entity250 , with the south predominantly @entity24			0
@entity6 and other @entity253 groups claim the north has been starved of resources and marginalized by the government of @entity233 , a @entity24			0
