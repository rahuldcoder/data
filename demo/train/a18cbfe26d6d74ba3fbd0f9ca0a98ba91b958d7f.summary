what 's better than a " supermoon " ? three supermoons ! the full moons of this summer -- july 12 , august 10 and september 9 -- are supermoons , as @entity5 calls them			1
the phenomenon happens when the moon becomes full on the same day as its perigee -- the point in the moon 's orbit when it 's closest to @entity13			1
@entity14 linked to supercreativity ? we think so " generally speaking , full moons occur near perigee every 13 months and 18 days , so it 's not all that unusual , " @entity16 of the @entity17 said in a statement from @entity5			2
" in fact , just last year there were three perigee moons in a row , but only one was widely reported			0
" @entity26 was talking about the supermoon that happened in june last year			2
it was 14 % bigger and 30 % brighter than other full moons of 2013 , and garnered international headlines			1
your stunning photos of starry skies the moon - loving public from around the world got into the act and posted numerous photos of this weekend 's supermoon on @entity40			2
" loving this super moon on the coast of @entity43 tonight			0
" @entity14 looks incredible right now ! ! ! " a man tweeted			0
@entity5 stressed that sometimes it 's hard to tell the difference between a supermoon and a regular full moon , as clouds and haze can mask a difference in brightness			1
" there 's a part of me that wishes that this ' @entity14 ' moniker would just dry up and blow away , like the ' @entity58 ' that accompanied the most recent lunar eclipse , because it tends to promulgate a lot of mis - information , " @entity16 said in his statement			0
" however , if it gets people out and looking at the night sky and maybe hooks them into astronomy , then it 's a good thing			0

it happens when the moon is full and at its closest point to @entity13
