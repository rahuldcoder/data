@entity0 -- when i first came across a " virtual lover " service on e-commerce site @entity4 , @entity7 's version of @entity8 , i thought it was hype			1
for an average of 20 yuan ( $ 3 ) per day , it claimed you could hire a boyfriend or girlfriend to talk on the phone or chat online to make you feel like you 're in love			1
the service varies but it includes wake - up calls , text and voice messages , phone calls and goodnight wishes			1
as the largest online shopping platform in @entity7 , @entity4 vendors sell anything they can think of as long as it 's not illegal			1
usually i would be skeptical about such a service but i was drawn to a comment left by one " virtual girlfriend " enthusiast			1
" it was awesome -- she shared my happiness and cheered me up when i was down			0
she has a beautiful voice , and an intelligent mind ... i so do n't want to leave her			0
" this glowing review got me interested in having my own " @entity39 " on my smartphone			0
i contacted the @entity4 vendor and she asked if i had any preferences			1
options included " doll - like girls " and " mature women , " while ladies had the choice of different types of " boyfriends , " including " comforting man , " " funny lad , " and " understanding uncle			2
" i said that i 'd like the girl to be cheerful but not too " doll - like			2
" then she asked for my wechat number , an instant messaging app with 450 million users , and told me there was no refund if i changed my mind			0
' journey of love ' it was n't long before i got my first voice message from my own virtual girlfriend , called @entity65 , outlining the terms of our relationship : " hello , this voice message is to prove that i 'm not a boy , nor a robot			1
also , please leave out anything erotic in our conversations			0
i 'm very much looking forward to our journey of love , " she said in a business - like voice			2
she told me she was a college student majoring in design , liked painting and hated pineapples , although she did n't know why			0
then she briefly lectured me on some ground rules of the game : no private information , no photos and no video chat			2
normally , i would much rather have a conversation with my date across a dinner table but her voice was intriguing and i spent a few hours chatting with her about food , music , relationships and our favorite tv series			0
confidence boost a virtual girlfriend may sound seedy but psychologist @entity99 says this kind of service appeals to men who do n't have the confidence to enter a real - life relationship			1
" they can gain confidence and feel loved through this experience and there 's no risk in getting frustrated from setbacks , " he told @entity1			1
" many young men ca n't find enough courage to approach girls they find interesting because they fear to be rejected			2
" i also wondered whether a person could really make a living from being someone 's virtual boyfriend or girlfriend and asked @entity65 to share her side of our virtual love story			1
she said people sign up with her for different reasons : some feel lonely and want to have someone to talk to , some seek comfort after breaking up with lovers , and many just sign up out of curiosity			2
" i 've had some quite dedicated ' lovers ' who would sign up for months just to chat with me , " she said			2
she said business had been good since she started working as a virtual girlfriend in july			1
however , she said she could n't remember how much money she made			0
for her , the job is more about hearing different stories			0
pleasant surprise the next morning , i woke up to find 24 unread messages			0
it was my girlfriend 's attempt to wake me up			1
we exchanged a few more voice and text messages but it did n't feel long before my day - long " virtual love affair " came to an end			1
if you want to know how it feels to have a virtual relationship , i 'd say if you 're lonely or heartbroken from a recent break up , finding a virtual lover might work better than boozing all night and drunk dialing your ex-lover at three in the morning			1
and for those who want to " get lucky " , i guarantee you 'll have better luck with the first person you dance with at the nearest club			0
though my virtual love affair was platonic , i still enjoyed her company			0
and i was pleasantly surprised when she asked to exchange photos and keep in touch after our day was up			0
