-- while he fell short of bluntly saying , " i told you so , " @entity1 , arguably @entity2 's most powerful energy executive , warned the @entity4 that it may not be able to count on @entity5 and @entity7 energy supplies as it once did			1
coming from @entity1 , the chief of @entity2 energy giant @entity10 , it was a not - too - subtle nudge that global importers of energy , especially @entity13 , should invest more in @entity2 oil and gas capacity			1
" the question about the reliability of gas deliveries from @entity7 to @entity13 should be more critically examined than it is currently			0
" said @entity1 in comments to @entity20 , a @entity10 - owned @entity2 broadcaster			2
@entity10 told @entity0 its executives were not available to further clarify his comments			0
however , @entity10 has been one of many @entity2 energy companies trying to attract more foreign investment to further exploit its vast and proven oil and gas reserves			1
" perhaps @entity2 is trying to issue some friendly advice ( to the @entity4 ) that maybe it 's time to diversify our sources of energy			2
it is good for @entity2 for it 's certainly in a position to do more			0
" said @entity37 , chief economist of @entity38 in @entity39			0
according to @entity41 government statistics , @entity2 is the world 's largest oil producer and second - largest exporter after @entity45			2
but the timely , if opportunistic , warning darkened an already jittery mood among energy analysts as some now discussed the possibility of an oil " superspike " that could fuel a commodities crisis in the months to come			1
how high could oil go ? while industry insiders agree a spike of $ 200 a barrel is unlikely , many are now unwilling to rule out that kind of a price range			0
oil cartel @entity60 has tried to calm concerns , saying spare capacity exists to soften the blow and moderate price spikes			1
but some now doubt the organization has a handle on spare capacity			1
" there is growing concern in the market that there is n't the spare capacity in @entity45 that the markets have been told there is , " said @entity67 , chief economist at @entity68			1
" the second problem is that the markets ca n't be as relaxed about the @entity5 and @entity7 now as they were even a week or two ago , " he said			0
" what matters about @entity79 is that you 've seen a regime which has been stable for the better part of 30 years and is in danger of being overthrown			0
the assumption that we can assume stability in , say @entity45 , or other countries around the @entity89 , that assumption is now going to be doubted by the markets , " @entity67 said .			0

head of energy giant @entity10 tells @entity4 that @entity5 supplies may not be reliable
energy analysts tense about possible " superspike " in oil prices
@entity60 has said spare capacity exists to moderate price spikes
economist : @entity5 uprisings and possibly *overstated* @entity45 reserves are big concerns
