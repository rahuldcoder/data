-- for cybersecurity reasons , sailors on @entity3 vessels ca n't always use smartphones and tablets			1
and in the cramped quarters of a submarine , there 's little room for shelves full of books			0
so how is a bookworm sailor supposed to pass the time during those long hours at sea ? the @entity3 has a solution : the @entity20 , or " @entity21 " for short , a custom - made , secure e-reader that comes preloaded with a library of 300 titles			1
the device has no cellular connectivity or @entity24 , so there are no signals to betray its location or tempt enemy hackers			1
yes , that @entity21 name may stigmatize reading for some seamen and women			2
but the @entity3 is hoping the new gadget will be a welcome companion for bored sailors			1
" i know the paperbacks ( on @entity3 ships ) get passed back and forth until they fall apart , " said @entity35 , program assistant for the @entity3 general @entity36			2
" we 're hoping the @entity21 holds up a little better			2
" the @entity3 will start by distributing five devices to each of the submarines in its active fleet , @entity35 told @entity0			0
eventually , it plans to send @entity21 to all @entity3 vessels			1
" i 've gotten some e-mails from sailors on surface vessels who are very eager to know when they 'll get them , " @entity35 said			0
each @entity21 will offer a mix of fiction , nonfiction , best - sellers , classics and historical books selected by the @entity3			1
popular titles will include the " @entity61 " series , " @entity62 , " " @entity63 , " " @entity64 , " @entity66 's " @entity65 " and " @entity67			0
" more literary - minded sailors will be able to read digital versions of classics by @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 and even @entity75 , whose " @entity77 " would make a fitting read			0
contrary to some news reports , @entity35 said the devices wo n't contain any @entity81 novels , however			0
so if sailors want their " @entity85 " fix , they 'll have to watch the movie adaptation on dvd			0
the e-readers were developed for the @entity3 through a partnership with @entity90 , which provides digital devices and audiobook technology to the @entity93			1
publishing partners for the @entity21 include @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 .			0

the @entity3 has developed a customized e-reader for its sailors
the " @entity21 " will come preloaded with a library of 300 titles
device has no connectivity and is more secure than a tablet
