@entity0 , @entity1 -- many southerners are voting for an independent @entity1 this week , thirsting for freedom from the north			1
they equate sharia or @entity8 law that president @entity9 has vowed to strengthen with slavery			1
@entity9 has declared that if @entity1 votes in favor of separation , sharia will become the main source of @entity1 's @entity15 , @entity8 the state religion and @entity18 the official language			1
many in the north are embracing @entity9 's pledge			0
newspaper publisher @entity22 said he will be happy to see his nation break in two			0
@entity8 , he said , comes above all else			2
" when the south goes , then the north will be @entity27 , " he said			0
" for a muslim , unity is not as important as religion			0
" but there are other faces of @entity8 in @entity1 , including a @entity35 community , and @entity22 's position is hardly shared by all @entity37			1
some in the north consider themselves @entity39 , others @entity41			0
they speak a dozen different languages , and while a majority of people are @entity46 , a significant number are @entity48 or practice traditional religions			0
@entity31 already is the law of the land in northern @entity1 , but @entity37 authorities have relaxed its enforcement since 2005 when a peace treaty ended more than 20 years of civil war			1
the war pitted a northern government of @entity46 against blacks in @entity1 who practice @entity58 and animist religions			2
it killed 2 million people and displaced several million others , mainly from @entity1			2
the president 's comments have stirred fear that the government will implement sharia for the hundreds of thousands of southerners and other non-muslims in northern @entity1 , including many who fled fighting , disease and famine in the south			1
even many @entity46 find the imposition of @entity8 law troubling , and it 's even more disturbing for the small and ancient @entity48 community in the north			1
" we as @entity48 , we feel that @entity58 is a @entity37 religion and should be respected , " said bishop @entity79 , who oversees @entity0 's @entity80 and chairs the @entity81			2
@entity9 's vow to strengthen @entity8 law came as a shock to @entity79			1
" as a church we are not happy with what he said , and we feel as the president -- he is the president for everyone in the country -- he knows very well that there are other religious communities			0
" but @entity93 , secretary - general of the @entity94 , brushed aside such concerns			0
" the @entity8 sharia guarantees the rights of non-muslims better than secular laws , " he said			2
" why ? because it 's an issue of a religious duty , and they are human rights sanctified by @entity104 almighty			0

@entity1 's president has pledged to strengthen sharia , or @entity8 law
many southerners equate sharia with slavery
@entity37 is *diverse* , though sharia *enjoys* *support*
