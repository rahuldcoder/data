@entity0 -- prosecutors in @entity3 , @entity4 , are investigating allegations that prime minister @entity6 paid for sex with a minor , a case that has stirred scandal , but not in every quarter			1
some @entity4 have no problems with the allegations of their leader 's sexual escapades that have garnered so much attention			1
" who cares ? i am so sick and tired of this story			0
what happens in a private home is his business and i do n't want to know , " said @entity20 , the owner of a lingerie shop			2
such an attitude is a throwback to an unspoken tradition in @entity4 of successful men taking on girlfriends and lavishing them with gifts			1
many frown upon this , but it remains acceptable to others			0
" those men who say that @entity6 should be ashamed of himself , i say to them , ' why ? ' " said clothing store owner @entity35			2
" would n't you like to do it ? you all do and you are just jealous			0
there are more serious troubles in this country than to go after @entity6 's whores			1
" @entity6 has denied that he has ever paid for sex			1
in @entity4 , having sex with a prostitute is not a crime -- unless she is a minor			1
@entity48 , nicknamed @entity49 , is the nightclub dancer at the center of the most recent headache for @entity6			2
she is now 18 , but was 17 at the time of the alleged activity , from february through may			0
@entity49 has said in an interview she told everyone she was 24			0
they both deny having had sex with each other , but a roommate of @entity49 's said in a court document that @entity49 admitted to having had an affair with the premier when she was 17			2
prosecutors are looking into it as a prostitution - with - a - minor case , though some wonder if @entity49 's involvement with @entity6 qualifies as prostitution			1
@entity49 's former roommate told police , " i remember that she would say that she was a close friend of the prime minister ... she said she was often in the premier 's house , where she had dinner , danced and had sex with him and who gave her a lot of money			2
" @entity6 says that the prosecutors have no jurisdiction to investigate him , while opposition lawmakers have urged him to speak with them			1
" we think he should just go and tell what he thinks is his truth , " opposition lawmaker @entity86 told @entity1			1
" if he has any dignity , he should leave the post and allow @entity4 to start again with a political leader who is not engulfed in scandal			1
" other @entity4 were also not forgiving of their prime minister			2
" it shames me as a citizen , as a man , and as a father , " a businessman said			0
" we have to keep our values			0
if not it would be total anarchy			0
it is disgusting what he does and even more disgusting that pages and pages of media go after this stuff because there is even worse and more serious trouble in this country			0
