-- these days , almost all new cellphones look alike : they 're sleek black rectangles with glowing color screens			1
they 're handsome , slender , well - dressed and a little predictable			2
if they were human , they 'd be infomercial hosts			0
we often take them for granted			0
but as anyone over the age of 15 remembers , it was n't always this way			0
in hindsight , mobile phones used to be downright ugly			1
as @entity15 -- the planet 's largest mobile - tech show -- prepares to kick off in @entity18 , @entity19 , we thought we 'd offer this gallery to remind us all how far we have come			1
twenty - five years ago , early adopters like @entity21 and @entity22 were lugging around phones the size of footballs			2
even a decade or so ago , most phones had dull gray screens , clamshell designs or tiny keypads that made you hit a button over and over to text one letter of the alphabet			1
so , the next time you complain about your @entity35 , @entity36 or @entity37 , remember : you could still be trying to communicate on one of these balky relics			0
what was your first cellphone ? does it conjure up any old stories ? do you still have it ? let us know in the comments .			0
