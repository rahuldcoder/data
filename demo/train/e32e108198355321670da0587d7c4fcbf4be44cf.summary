@entity0 , @entity1 -- the most impressive thing about @entity0 is the people who live there			1
when we go on shoots with @entity2 's @entity9 , it 's usually the spectacular scenery , or technical wizardry that we are trying to film			2
this time we had to film a way of life -- people and animals and nature			2
in a word , biodiversity			1
yusufeli in the @entity20 is famed for its wealth of species			2
the rural areas are alive with bees buzzing , frogs croaking and the sound of rushing water			2
brown bears roam the upper slopes of the mountains			0
in the town itself , old men sit outside and play backgammon with a cup of @entity1 tea to hand			1
and it 's under threat from an unlikely source			0
the @entity0 dam project is part of @entity1 's national plan to expand its use of hydropower			1
this is a huge project , which will eventually see up to 3,000 working dams all over the country			1
the @entity50 , which runs through the town , will eventually have 15 dams on it			0
when the project is complete the town will be flooded , but the dam system will provide one tenth of @entity1 's electricity			1
and that 's the crux of the matter			0
@entity1 is a rapidly developing country with one of the fastest growing economies in the world			1
as the mayor of @entity0 told us , " energy has an important role to play in terms of the development of countries			0
" nobody can deny that hydro is one of the cheapest , cleanest , most efficient ways of producing electricity			0
that means the @entity0 dam is a very attractive proposition for the state and perhaps a sacrifice for the greater good			1
at the moment @entity1 's energy sector is dependent on dirty , expensive fossil fuels , which are imported			1
by capitalizing on the country 's rivers , the state moves towards greater energy independence			0
i arranged an interview with @entity90 , the state hydraulic company that is building the @entity0 dam			1
but when we turned up , they refused to speak to us on camera , despite having agreed to the interview some weeks before			0
the company said the situation was " sensitive			1
" the people of @entity0 have been waiting for the axe to fall for some time			0
one resident we interviewed said he had first heard talk of a dam forty years ago			1
most people we spoke to said if it was going to come , it should come soon			0
all residents were unsure of their future			0
and yet i was struck by the building sites all over the town			0
@entity0 residents have not yet accepted this dam			2
@entity110 , a local @entity111 worker , described his town as " thriving			0
" the @entity50 is the second fastest river in the world , which draws rafting tourism to this small town from all over the world			0
@entity0 is also one of the @entity118 's designated " biodiversity hotspots "			1
there are over 200 species of butterflies in this region alone			0
and it is along these lines that the campaign to stop the @entity0 dam continues			2
locals who have worked the land using traditional methods are joining with ngos and international campaigners to raise the profile of @entity0 as an area of exceptional importance			2
following several campaigns , some @entity136 financial backers have withdrawn their support for the dam			1
this is a problem without a satisfactory answer			0
and yet if countries like @entity1 want to develop , hydro - electricity is a clean , efficient way of doing so			1
will @entity0 dam be built ? will progress win out over preservation ? leave your thoughts in the " sound off " box below and click here find out how you can be part of @entity2 's @entity155 's frontiers debate next month .			2

proposed dam in *northeast* @entity1 could provide *abundant* power supply
the project would lead to flooding of whole towns in *ecologically* rich area
issue is *increasingly* sensitive as some financial backers pull out of project
area is one of @entity118 - designated biodiversity hotspots
