the @entity12 side will be allowed to continue in this season 's @entity2 , where they have reached the last 16 stage , but any ban would come into place over any of the next four seasons should they qualify to play in @entity5			1
@entity1 are the first high - profile club to be punished under new tougher @entity7 rules with @entity5 's @entity21 ( @entity22 ) making their ruling after a hearing friday in @entity25 , @entity26			1
@entity1 owe player wages and have debts with other football sides as well as the @entity31 tax authorities , claim @entity5			2
the @entity22 has given the club until march 31 next year to settle the debts and will impose a further one season ban from @entity5 competitions , the @entity2 or @entity36 , if they fail to do so			1
@entity1 have also been fined â ‚ ¬ 300,000 ( $ 396,000 ) but @entity5 has released prize money due them from this season 's @entity2			1
the club issued a strongly worded statement friday to express their " total disagreement " with the @entity5 decision			2
it went on : " the measures taken against the club are absolutely disproportionate and unjustified given the club 's situation			0
we consider that the club is being punished unfairly and used as a scapegoat and example to others			0
" @entity1 wishes to state that it will work energetically and without rest to achieve justice , using all available necessary means			0
" the club , who are currently fourth in @entity12 , a spot which would see them qualify for a @entity9 place next season , can appeal to the @entity61 in @entity62 in an attempt to overturn the decision			1
since coming under the ownership of @entity66 , a member of the @entity68 ruling family , @entity1 have spent heavily on new players			0
but in november , they were one of nine @entity9 clubs referred to the @entity22 because of debt problems and infringements of @entity5 's licensing agreements and one of 23 to have prize money withheld			2
despite the threat of sanctions looming over the club , @entity1 have performed superbly this season under coach @entity81 , winning @entity82 of the @entity2 with a game to spare and earning a tie against @entity85 in the knockout stage			1
five other clubs face one - year @entity9 bans , valid for three seasons , if they do not settle their debts by march 31			2
@entity92 sides @entity93 and @entity94 ; @entity96 's @entity95 and @entity97 ; and @entity98 of @entity99 , were all handed the punishment			0

this season is the first since @entity5 's @entity7 rules were introduced and they will come more fully into force in 2014			1
