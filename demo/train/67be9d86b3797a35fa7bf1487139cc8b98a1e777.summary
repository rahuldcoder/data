-- the tiny landlocked nation of @entity2 may be known for its violent past but tourism officials are hoping , with the help of mountain gorillas , that travelers will see for themselves why the " land of a thousand hills " is worth a visit			1
@entity11 @entity2 is one of just three countries where the world 's population of mountain gorillas can be observed in the wild			1
in addition to @entity2 's @entity20 , gorillas also inhabit @entity22 's @entity21 and @entity24 's @entity23			1
these parks border each other and the area the mountain gorillas call home is known as @entity30			1
@entity20 is about two hours from @entity31 , @entity2 's capital			1
the drive to the park will make it obvious why @entity2 is referred to as the " land of a thousand hills			1
" locals cultivate the lush green hills where the gorilla treks begin , and there are five volcanoes in the park			1
the scenery is stunning from a distance but it may lose its appeal as you make your climb in search of the gorillas , who will determine the altitude and incline of the hike			2
the trek up the mountain can be challenging , with thick brush , fire ants and stinging nettles			0
it can take minutes or hours depending on where the gorillas decide to rest			2
" the gorillas do n't need any visas or passports to leave one country and go to another one , " the guide jokes as he leads a group of eight tourists up the side of the mountain			1
lucky visitors will see the animals feeding and crushing through the underbrush , babies running around and full - grown gorillas inching toward observers loudly declaring their importance			2
hikers are not permitted closer than 10 meters , but the gorillas are under no such restriction and may creep closer , as tourist heart rates increase			2
as with most wildlife tours there are no guarantees of gorilla sightings , but the odds of seeing them are good , according to @entity90 , president of @entity91			0
" in 11 years i 've never had someone in @entity2 not see the gorillas , " says @entity90			1
@entity90 tells his clients to prepare for treks up to 9,000 feet above sea level			0
" if the gorillas are moving one particular day and there is somebody having a hard time keeping up physically then that person may not see them			2
" visitors need a permit to hike up the mountain in hopes of seeing a family of mountain gorillas			2
the cost is $ 500 per person and permits are limited to 56 a day			0
permits should be purchased well in advance and they can be obtained through a tour company or directly from the issuing organization , the country 's @entity115			1
included in the price are the guides assigned by the park			2
once the mountain gorillas are located , visitors will spend an hour watching these incredible animals			2
" we only have one tour a day for one hour in order to give the animals free range , " says @entity123 , a guide in the area for 24 years			0
golden monkeys perhaps not as high - profile but also worth the time is a trip to see @entity2 's golden monkeys , and the price of the permit is less expensive than for gorillas : $ 100 per person			1
the monkeys are also located in @entity20			2
this tour is a good way to get adjusted to the altitude , which when tracking the gorillas can be at elevations from 7,000 to 9,000 feet , and it offers a taste of what to expect on the mountain gorilla trek if visitors do this first			2
" it 's a shorter walk to the golden monkeys than the mountain gorillas " since the gorillas are found at the higher altitude says @entity123			1
unlike the gorillas , which move at a slower pace and tend to rest as a group in one place , the monkeys keep tourists on their toes			1
" they are fast so we have to be fast , " says @entity123			0
once spotted you may be following the monkeys as they swing from the treetops overhead			2
watching them you will realize how aptly named playground equipment such as monkey bars and jungle gyms are ; only here the equipment is bamboo			0
seeing these endangered animals in their natural habitat is worth an extra day in the area			0
there 's only one tour per day for the monkeys and one overlapping tour for gorillas , so you ca n't visit both the big and small primates in the same day			1
@entity183 sites it 's possible to visit several of @entity2 's many memorial sites commemorating the 1994 genocide in a day			1
learning about the country 's history is important in understanding the people and places you will encounter , says @entity2 ambassador to the @entity194 @entity193			1
the @entity2 of today is a different place than the country that once dominated the news , he says			1
" it is one of the safest places to visit , " says @entity193			0
" you can go out at night and not be bothered			0
" that was n't the case less than two decades ago when ethnic violence in @entity2 erupted and @entity205 were systematically murdered by @entity206 in 1994			1
it was a time when neighbors killed neighbors and old friends became bitter enemies			0
" if you knew me and you really knew yourself you would not have killed me			0
" this quote by @entity214 , a survivor of the genocide , is found at genocide sites throughout the country including the @entity218			1
located in the capital , the @entity218 should not be missed			0
it is a disturbing yet honest look at this country 's horrific past			1
the center estimates that more than 1 million -- mostly @entity205 but also moderate @entity206 -- were murdered within 100 days during the genocide			0
exhibits introduce you to children such as 4 - year - old @entity228 who was " stabbed in her eyes and head			0
" outside in the quiet courtyard , remains continue to be placed in mass graves as they are discovered			0
many churches around the country are no longer places of worship but places to pay respect to those who died while trying to escape death			0
instead of safe havens , some churches turned into places to find easy prey to massacre			0
@entity248 and @entity249 are two churches about an hour outside of @entity31			0
the bullet - riddled roofs and clothing of those killed are reminders of the people who huddled inside in hope of being spared			0
a guide at @entity258 said more than 10,000 people were killed at the church and in the immediate area			0
the yard of @entity248 is now a mass grave where freshly cut flowers are left by those who survived			0
down in the crypt is a powerful display of reality that some may find unnecessary to view : rows upon rows of skulls and bones			0
people are still healing , but @entity2 have opened their past in order to embrace the future			1
tourism is important in rebuilding , says @entity193 , and thankfully @entity2 has enough natural and cultural history to make it worth a stamp in your passport .			1
