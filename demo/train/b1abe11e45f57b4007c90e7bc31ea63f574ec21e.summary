-- @entity2 4 - 2 @entity1 @entity2 cruised into the semifinals of @entity4 as @entity1 's unlikely run in the tournament was ruthlessly brought to a halt in @entity8			1
@entity10 's long - range strike , @entity12 's superb volley , @entity14 's header and a @entity16 thunderbolt sealed a comfortable victory			1
the result only looked briefly in doubt when @entity20 brought @entity1 level for six minutes in the second half , while @entity23 made the @entity25 deficit respectable with a late penalty			1
@entity2 's win vindicated a pre-match selection gamble from their manager @entity29 , who surprisingly rested his three main attackers @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35			2
they will all expect to return to the starting line - up when @entity2 take on either @entity38 or @entity39 in next thursday 's semifinal			1
" i thought i had to change things after three wins , " said @entity29 following the victory			0
" that was a class performance			0
we failed to take an early lead , but we did not panic			0
we can be proud of the team			0
" soccer live : @entity0 's blog from friday 's second @entity4 quarterfinal the pre-match talk had centred on political tensions between the two nations over @entity1 's debt			1
but the @entity55 were anything but economical in the opening exchanges as a series of chances went begging			2
the most inviting fell to @entity61 , who sidefooted weakly at the keeper from 12 yards , while @entity16 was also wasteful			2
@entity1 's players , meanwhile , were models of thrift and caution , with five across the midfield and lone striker @entity23 subsisting on the merest of scraps			1
but for all @entity72 ' side 's diligent defending , it was a lack of concentration at the back that led to @entity2 's opening goal			0
@entity10 was allowed the time and space to cut inside from the left and unleash a swerving 20 - yard strike with his lethal right foot			1
it meant @entity1 , who had failed to carve out a single chance of note in the first half , needed to revamp their gameplan after the break			0
yet even while behind , the underdogs seemed content to keep players back and not leave themselves open to a fatal second goal			0
this minimalist approach to attacking appeared to be paying off when they equalized courtesy of three touches of real class			0
the first was a sumptuous pass from @entity99 into the path of @entity23 , who burst down the right and delivered a wicked low cross for @entity20 to slide the ball home from close range			1
it was one of the most astonishing moments of the tournament so far , but the @entity25 jubilation was short - lived			0
six minutes later , @entity55 superiority was restored when @entity111 crossed and @entity12 hammered in a spectacular volley from the edge of the box			1
@entity2 's third goal was as soft as their second was brilliant , @entity14 nodding home from @entity61 's corner after the hapless @entity25 goalkeeper @entity120 recklessly tried to claim the ball			1
@entity16 then added a fourth with a blistering volley after @entity120 parried a @entity124 strike into his teammate 's path			0
there was time for @entity23 to grab a consolation from the spot after @entity111 was adjudged to have handled in the box			2
but it would have taken more than that to dent the spirits of a @entity55 side who , having been confident enough to rest three key players of a quarterfinal of a major championship , will now have a strong belief they can win it .			2

@entity2 beat @entity1 4 - 2 in @entity4 quarterfinal
@entity10 put @entity55 in front before @entity20 ' shock leveller
@entity12 , @entity14 and @entity16 restored @entity55 *advantage*
@entity23 *netted* consolation penalty for @entity1
