-- a @entity2 pastor told @entity0 on tuesday that while his congregation still plans to burn @entity4 to protest the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , the church is " weighing " its intentions			1
@entity8 , pastor of @entity9 in @entity10 , @entity2 , who was interviewed on @entity0 's " @entity12 , " said the congregation is taking seriously the warning from the @entity16 military that the act could cause problems for @entity16 troops			1
" we have firmly made up our mind , but at the same time , we are definitely praying about it , " @entity8 said			2
later tuesday , @entity8 had a response to a statement from gen. @entity25 , the @entity16 commander in @entity26 , who said the burning of @entity30 's holy books " could cause significant problems " for @entity16 troops overseas			1
" it could endanger troops and it could endanger the overall effort in @entity26 , " @entity25 said in a statement issued monday			1
" the general needs to point his finger to radical @entity30 and tell them to shut up , tell them to stop , tell them that we will not bow our knees to them , " @entity8 said on @entity0 's " @entity35			1
" " we are burning the book , " @entity8 said			2
" we are not killing someone			2
we are not murdering people			2
" the planned action has drawn sharp criticism from @entity50 around the world and from @entity16 officials			1
the @entity16 @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity26 , on tuesday issued a statement saying the @entity16 government " in no way condones such acts of disrespect against the religion of @entity30 , and is deeply concerned about deliberate attempts to offend members of religious or ethnic groups			1
" it emphasized that it strongly condemned " the offensive messages , which are contrary to @entity16 government policy and deeply offensive to @entity50 especially during the month of @entity67			1
" " americans from all religious and ethnic backgrounds reject the offensive initiative by this small group in @entity2			2
a great number of @entity16 voices are protesting the hurtful statements made by this organization , " the embassy said			1
with about 120,000 @entity16 and @entity79 - led troops still battling @entity80 and its allies in the @entity30 fundamentalist @entity83 movement , @entity25 warned that burning @entity4 " is precisely the kind of action the @entity83 uses and could cause significant problems -- not just here , but everywhere in the world we are engaged with the @entity30 community			1
" @entity25 said he was concerned about the political repercussions of the church 's plan			1
" even the rumor that it might take place has sparked demonstrations such as the one that took place in @entity54 yesterday , " he said			2
" were the actual burning to take place , the safety of our soldiers and civilians would be put in jeopardy and accomplishment of the mission would be made more difficult			2
" one of @entity25 ' deputies , lt. gen. @entity111 , told @entity0 's " @entity112 " that the event " has already stirred up a lot of discussion and concern " among @entity26			1
" we very much feel that this can jeopardize the safety of our men and women that are serving over here in the country , " said @entity111 , the head of @entity79 efforts to train @entity26 security forces			2
@entity111 said @entity16 troops " are over here to defend the rights of @entity16 citizens , and we 're not debating the @entity129 rights that people have			1
" but he added , " what i will tell you is that their very actions will in fact jeopardize the safety of the young men and women who are serving in uniform over here and also undermine the very mission that we 're trying to accomplish			0
" " i would hope they would understand that there are second - and third - order effects that will occur that will affect that young man and woman who 's out there on point for @entity16 , serving their nation today , because of their actions back in the @entity16 , " he said			1
thousands of @entity155 gathered outside the @entity53 in @entity156 , @entity155 , on sunday to protest the planned @entity158 burning			1
" the burning is not only an insult to the holy quran , but an insult to @entity30 and @entity50 around the world , " said @entity162 , a spokesman for the hard - line @entity155 @entity50 group @entity163			1
@entity8 said his congregation is aware that the action is offensive			1
" we realize that this action would indeed offend people , offend the @entity50			0
i am offended when they burn the flag			0
i am offended when they burn the @entity173			0
but we feel that the message that we are trying to send is much more important than people being offended			0
" @entity8 said @entity50 are welcomed in the @entity16 , if they observe the @entity176 and do n't try to impose @entity178 law , or @entity50 law			2
the message , he said , is directed toward the " radical element of @entity30			1
" " our message is very clear , " he said			0
" it is not to the moderate @entity50			0
our message is not a message of hate			0
our message is a message of warning to the radical element of @entity30 , and i think what we see right now around the globe provides exactly what we 're talking about , " he said			1
the center says it was founded in 1986 as a " total concept church for the rich , the poor , the young and the old			0
" its purpose is to " stand up for righteousness and for the truth of the @entity173			0
" it stresses that " @entity197 must return to the truth and stop hiding			0
" " we need to speak up against sin and call the people to repentance			0
we need to call these things what they are and bring the world the true message : that @entity213 is the way , the truth , and the life , " it says on the church 's website			0
it also emphasizes its dislike of @entity30 , and on its website , it blog posts an item called " ten reasons to burn a @entity158			1
" any religion which would profess anything other than this truth is of the devil			0
this is why we also take a stand against @entity30 , which teaches that @entity213 is not the @entity229 , therefore taking away the saving power of @entity213 and leading people straight to @entity232 , " the site says			2
" it is our vision to go around , to preach and to challenge , and to get the church involved and ready			0
we must go outside of the walls , and march for righteousness			0
" commenting the other day on @entity8 ' critique of @entity30 , @entity239 , the imam of an @entity242 , @entity241 , mosque , said that his words are " really quite uninformed			1
" " but in @entity16 , there is the freedom to be ignorant , " @entity239 said			2
" the only problem is in the world , many people do n't understand that particular freedom			0
so what he is doing is like shouting fire in a theater , in a world theater , and people are upset			0
" @entity256 said @entity8 has boasted of never reading the @entity158 , so , " he does n't know that he 's going to burn a book that has some of the most beautiful passages about @entity213 throughout , as well as @entity260 , @entity261 and all of the prophets he reads about and says he follows in the @entity173			2
" but he said the best strategy would be to ignore @entity8 , " like we do people on corners saying the end of the world is coming			0
" other religious organizations have joined with @entity16 @entity50 groups to oppose the quran - burning			1
the @entity273 is urging the church to cancel the event , warning that it could cause worldwide tension between the two religions , and @entity197 , @entity50 , @entity278 and @entity280 leaders in @entity10 have organized a " @entity281 " the night before the scheduled @entity158 burning			1
the @entity16 @entity53 statement said that in his speech on @entity30 last year in @entity286 , @entity287 , president @entity284 said it is part of his responsibility to fight " negative stereotypes of @entity30 , " and he mentioned interfaith efforts " to counter this kind of ignorance and misinformation			1
" " and during his recent @entity296 speech at the @entity297 , he said : let me be clear : as a citizen , and as president , i believe that @entity50 have the same right to practice their religion as anyone else in this country			0
" in the @entity0 interview , @entity8 was asked about the @entity307 principle of turning the other cheek -- not acting out in violence or engaging in payback and in deed			0
" i think in deed that most of the time , we as @entity197 are indeed called to turn the other cheek			0
i believe that most of the time , talk and diplomacy is the correct way			0
but i always think that once in a while , i think you see that in the @entity173 , there are incidents where enough is enough and you stand up , " @entity8 said			0
an armed @entity307 organization that had pledged to protect the @entity9 withdrew its support from the @entity158 - burning last week , stating the event " may diminish the work of the @entity325 to witness to @entity50			1
" that group 's founder , @entity327 , said he agrees with the church 's stance on @entity30 , which he called a cult " that is invading our nation			2
" but he complained that the " liberal media " is using stories about @entity8 ' plans " to distract , divide and enrage the public			0
" @entity0 's @entity338 contributed to this report .			0
