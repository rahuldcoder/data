@entity0 -- defense secretary @entity2 announced some far - reaching proposals monday for restructuring the massive budget at his agency , including getting rid of the @entity6			1
the cuts could mean a loss of thousands of jobs			1
the current defense department budget totals more than $ 530 billion a year , and defense officials believe they need increases of 2 to 3 percent a year to sustain the force structure and meet modernization needs			2
however , the recession caused the department to propose a 1 percent budget increase for next year , and the cuts announced monday were intended to help hold down overall costs			1
" we must be mindful of the difficult economic and fiscal situation facing our nation , " @entity2 told reporters at the @entity21			1
" as a matter of principle and political reality , the @entity21 can not expect @entity28 's elected representatives to approve budget increases each year unless we are doing a good job , indeed , everything possible to make every dollar count			1
" @entity33 's acknowledged the plan was " politically fraught , " and congressional criticism began even before @entity2 was finished announcing the moves			2
the proposal to eliminate the @entity6 , which is based in @entity38 , @entity39 , met with opposition from both the state 's @entity28 @entity42 senators			1
sen. @entity44 released a statement saying getting rid of it " would be a step backward and could be harmful " to the military , while sen. @entity49 said : " i can see no rational basis for dismantling " the @entity6			2
the command , which has an annual budget of $ 240 million and 2,800 military and civilian employees , is one of the department 's 10 " combatant commands			0
" unlike most of the others , it does not have a particular global region of responsibility , such as @entity62 that is responsible for the @entity63			0
the command is made up of soldiers , sailors , airmen and @entity68 who are trained and equipped to work together in response to the needs of other combatant commands			0
it grew out of the old @entity73 and became the @entity6 in 1999			0
gen. @entity74 had been commander until he was recently picked to become @entity62 commander			0
gen. @entity76 , currently head of @entity28 forces in @entity79 , has been picked to run the @entity6			0
" i told @entity80 that his assignment at @entity6 is essentially the same as his assignment in @entity79 , and that is working himself out of a job			0
eliminating the @entity6 is just one of a wide - ranging series of proposals presented by @entity2			1
others include : -- eliminating some of the 65 military boards and commissions to cut the budget for them by 25 percent in fiscal year 2011 ; -- a review of all @entity21 intelligence to eliminate needless duplication ; -- eliminating the @entity21 's @entity97 , which has day - to - day oversight of acquisition programs that would be handled by others in the department ; -- reducing funding for service support contractors by 10 percent a year for each of the next three years ; -- freezing the number of jobs in the officer of the secretary of defense , the @entity108 and @entity109 at current levels ; -- seeking to stop " brass creep , " a term former sen. @entity112 used for situations when higher - ranking officers were doing jobs that lower ranking officers could handle			1
to address that problem , @entity2 is ordering a freeze on the number of generals , admirals and senior civilian officials at current levels			0
@entity2 was adamant that the @entity21 must change its way of thinking about money			1
" the culture of endless money that has taken hold must be replaced by a culture of savings and restraint , " @entity2 said			2
" toward this end , i am directing that any new proposal or initiatives , large or small , be it policy , program or ceremony , come with a cost estimate			0
that price tag will help us determine whether what we are gaining or hope to gain is really worth the cost			0
