-- embattled @entity2 mayor @entity1 said he is taking a break from his re-election campaign to seek help for alcohol abuse -- hours after a local newspaper reported on a new video that allegedly shows him smoking crack cocaine			1
" it 's not easy to be vulnerable and this is one of the most difficult times in my life , " @entity1 said in a statement wednesday			1
" i have a problem with alcohol , and the choices i have made while under the influence			2
i have struggled with this for some time			2
" the statement , provided to @entity0 by @entity23 's @entity22 , comes after the @entity24 reported on the new video			1
in the video purportedly filmed saturday , the newspaper reports @entity27 is seen smoking what a drug dealer described to the paper as crack cocaine from a copper - colored pipe			0
two @entity24 reporters viewed the video , and the publication said it was shot in what appears to be @entity1 's sister 's basement			1
the paper said the substance in the pipe could not be confirmed			1
the video is part " of a package of three videos the dealer said was surreptitiously filmed around 1:15 a.m. , and which he says he is now selling for ' at least six figures , ' " the paper reported			0
leave is immediate shortly after the newspaper confronted the mayor about the video , @entity27 announced he was taking a break to get help			1
" today , after taking some time to think about my own well - being , how to best serve the people of @entity2 and what is in the best interests of my family , i have decided to take a leave from campaigning and from my duties as mayor to seek immediate help , " he said			0
his lawyer , @entity66 , told @entity0 that @entity27 's leave begins immediately			1
" he has to take a break to re-energize , because he realizes he has flaws that have to be addressed , " @entity66 told @entity22			1
but @entity66 told the @entity24 that he questioned the authenticity of the video , and said it is hard to prove what the mayor is smoking			0
" if these guys are drug dealers and there 's money involved , they can say whatever they want to get more money , to extract more money from the people who are paying , " he said of the seller			2
the @entity24 said it did not buy the video , adding it purchased screen grabs from the three clips			0
fall from grace @entity27 's fall from grace started in may 2013 when a cell phone video taken months earlier appeared to show him smoking crack cocaine			2
despite intense public pressure , he remained defiant and denied using any illicit drugs			0
in november , the city council stripped him of most of his power as mayor			0
that did n't stop @entity27 , though			0
he ignored calls to enter rehab or resign , instead vowing " outright war " on the city council			0
" if you think @entity110 - style politics is nasty , you guys have just attacked @entity111 , " he said then to groans and laughter in the city council chambers			0
seeking another term and none of this stopped @entity1 from seeking another term in office , something he 's done for the past few months despite continued public ridicule and other challenges			1
in january , he admitted he had suffered a " minor setback " after a video posted on social media showed him babbling about the city 's police chief while at a fast - food restaurant			1
again , he insisted that he 'd had a small amount to drink , but he had n't taken any drugs			0
" as you know , i 'm a human being -- the same as every one of you , " he told reporters at the time			0
" and i 'm entitled to a personal life , and my personal life does not interfere with the work i do , day - in and day - out , for the taxpayers of this great city			2
" @entity0 's @entity136 contributed to this report			1

his break comes after a new report linked him to substance abuse
the report *surfaced* on @entity23 media
" it 's not easy to be vulnerable and this is one of the most difficult times in my life , " @entity1 says
