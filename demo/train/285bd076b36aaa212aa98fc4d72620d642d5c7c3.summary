-- president @entity1 unveiled thursday a new military strategy			1
it calls for " pivoting " from the @entity4 to the @entity5 , focusing partly on the military buildup of @entity7			2
without a major public debate of the kind we have about raising taxes , or a congressional vote , the @entity9 government is moving slowly but surely toward characterizing @entity7 as an aggressive superpower and is preparing for war , should it become necessary			1
@entity17 , retired lieutenant general and current director of national intelligence , characterized @entity7 , " growing in its military capabilities , " as a " mortal threat " to the @entity9			1
@entity21 , chairman of the @entity22 , said , " the @entity7 military openly regards the @entity9 as an enemy			1
we should not undermine our own security by thinking we can make friends with self - proclaimed adversaries with hospitality and open arms			0
" @entity7 's leaders tend to stress that they do not seek a confrontation			0
@entity34 spokesman @entity33 stated that " @entity7 from beginning to end pursues a defensive national defense policy , and sticks to the path of peaceful development			2
" still , one can readily find belligerent voices from @entity7			2
gen. @entity40 expressed willingness to abandon @entity7 's " no first use " nuclear weapons poloicy , to defend its claim over @entity43 and argued that @entity7 should use nuclear weapons against the @entity9 should its military interfere			1
a 2011 editorial in the @entity49 ( an @entity51 edition of the @entity52 of @entity7 's official newspaper ) warned that countries involved in sea disputes with @entity7 " need to prepare for the sounds of cannons			2
" moreover , there were several incidents in which @entity7 exhibited provocative , troubling behavior			2
in 2009 , the @entity61 reported that five @entity7 vessels " shadowed and aggressively maneuvered in dangerously close proximity to @entity63 , in an apparent coordinated effort to harass the @entity9 ocean surveillance ship			1
" in 2011 , @entity7 patrol boats cut a @entity70 survey ship 's cables			0
@entity9 hawks hold that the @entity9 must build up its military , given @entity7 's rapid military buildup			1
however , @entity9 doves point out that @entity7 's defense spending is rather small			1
@entity7 government - released figures say they spent $ 70 billion on defense in 2009 , though @entity61 estimates place it somewhere between $ 122.5 billion and $ 175 billion			0
for comparison , the @entity9 defense budget for fiscal year 2009 was about $ 687 billion			0
while @entity7 launched its first aircraft carrier in august 2011 , the @entity82 has 11			0
as @entity7 's economic growth slows and the cost of its social and environmental problems rises , it is likely to curb the increases in its defense spending -- unless spurred on by @entity9 moves			1
the same doves point out that @entity7 's military modernization began from a low baseline			0
@entity7 's highly bureaucratic and inefficient military - industrial complex lags behind even its own nonmilitary and non-state - owned counterparts			0
its nuclear submarines are poorly designed			0
it has few military communications satellites			0
@entity7 's nuclear - armed bomber fleet is woefully obsolete , and its military is reported to face major problems in its command - and - control systems			0
all but the most ardent @entity103 hawks see no significant @entity7 military threat to core @entity9 interests in the near or even intermediate future			1
@entity107 finds that " the transformation of the @entity109 [ @entity109 ] into a region - wide strategic power will require many decades ... the transformation of the @entity109 into a global strategic power is an even more distant prospect			0
" and @entity114 contends , " there is no serious military man in @entity7 or in the @entity9 who thinks that @entity7 has any prayer of dominating the @entity9 militarily in the coming three or four decades			1
" hence , the @entity9 can safely continue to seek to turn @entity7 into a partner before concluding that a course of confrontation is unavoidable			1
the @entity9 could work with @entity7 to secure pathways for energy and raw materials that are very important to @entity7 , and should not bother us			2
the @entity9 could agree with @entity7 to settle in an international court or through negotiations differences about claims over the @entity129 ; and stop calling on @entity7 's neighboring countries to get together to oppose @entity7 's legitimate interests			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity134 .			0

president @entity1 unveiled @entity9 military strategy which will focus more on @entity137
@entity134 says many voices in @entity9 policy assume we should see @entity7 as potential enemy
@entity7 has made provocative moves , but its forces are dwarfed by the @entity9 military
@entity134 : rather than prepare for war , @entity9 should reach out to *improve* relations with @entity7
