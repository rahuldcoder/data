-- retail stores across @entity2 sold nonmedical marijuana to adults for the first time wednesday			1
as someone who has worked on reforming marijuana laws for nearly three years , i decided to take part as a customer and get in line			1
advocates , industry members and media stayed away from partying @entity15 to get up early to commemorate the historic day			2
we began at @entity18 cannabis dispensary at 7 a.m. with a press conference			2
we joined city and state representatives at @entity23 dispensary later in the morning			0
the atmosphere was reminiscent of a concert or sporting event			0
people who braved the cold stood in line and made small talk			1
a lot of people , particularly those over 50 , said " it 's about time , " and told stories about arrests spanning decades for using marijuana			1
it was like a wedding or @entity39 , with lots of picture - taking , hugs and congratulatory wishes -- except it was 7 a.m. and coffee and cocoa took the place of beer and wine			0
i waited alongside three fairly young men who drove nine hours from @entity51 to take part			0
behind them was a couple from @entity55 who insisted their decision to go to @entity58 was not solely based on buying state - regulated marijuana -- but it played a significant role			2
many others were local marijuana users looking forward to experiencing what only medical marijuana patients had been accustomed to in @entity2			1
once in earshot of the " budtenders , " the conversation was fairly surreal			0
i asked for a strain perfect for after work , something to make me relax and help me sleep -- a @entity71			0
i was told two indica strains are solid sellers for this purpose : @entity75 and @entity76			0
@entity75 had a light pine smell ; ogre was more musty and pungent like you might imagine a hairy monster would be			0
i went with the ogre with thoughts of @entity83 in my mind			0
the stores are fully backed by the state and local governments , and have been given a cautious green light by the federal government to proceed as planned			0
@entity2 voters approved @entity91 64 , which legalized pot for recreational use , because they believe marijuana prohibition is more harmful than good and wastes resources			1
@entity2 's previous efforts to decriminalize the plant -- remove criminal penalties for possession of small amounts of marijuana while it still remained technically illegal -- have already proven cost effective , practical and safe			1
according to the @entity105 , the amendment 's decriminalization alone would save the state $ 12 million in 2012			1
in the last decade , the state has averaged more than 10,000 arrests and citations per year for minor marijuana possession			1
the number of arrests has dropped over the last year to below 4,500 , but this number represents high increases in arrests for public consumption			1
public consumption is a primary issue ahead of us			2
using marijuana in public is still illegal in @entity2 , and the @entity121 has been engaging in a long back and forth to define " open and public use			1
" the current definition is n't specific enough for the post- @entity91 era			0
the proposed law in @entity58 would allow for open and public use as long as it 's on private property with permission of the owner or lessee			1
smoking is not allowed on city sidewalks , parks or the downtown mall			0
law enforcement rarely arrested anyone for public use before @entity91 , when possession charges were the primary prohibition			1
we expect this number to stabilize and decline as law enforcement , decision - makers and users establish a culture of responsible use			0
fortunately , use and consumption laws will soon be a civil issue in @entity58 , not a criminal one			0
on the way back to the car after making my first fully legal and regulated marijuana purchase , i saw the guys from @entity51 again			1
i handed them educational brochures created by local reform advocates that provide various resources , address the effects and caution for consuming potent edibles , and generally explain the law			0
the young men thanked me , jumped in their jeep with @entity51 license plates and @entity166 covers and took off			0
the state is addressing potential harms of using marijuana with public education , safety and health outreach efforts			2
it felt good to put this new reality in action with cautionary discussions with the @entity177 and others throughout the day			2
@entity2 is leading the nation in a new way to control marijuana , focusing scarce law enforcement resources away from arresting responsible users			1
it is satisfying to be part of that process , and it feels incredible to be in a position to promote safety and positive experiences for adults who are now law - abiding			2
they are pioneering an end to prohibition just by being regular people , standing in line , and behaving with friendly cheer and good spirits on the first day of 2014			1
the sky did n't fall in the @entity58			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity201 .			2

@entity201 bought marijuana at a store in @entity2 on first day of legal pot for adults
way : in line , the mood was *celebratory* , with people saying " it 's about time "
way : arrests for possession have *plummeted* , but you can get arrested for public use
he says @entity2 is leading the nation in a new way to control marijuana and save money
