-- the embattled @entity3 army is being pushed to the limit as anti-government demonstrations persist across the restive landscape , and the opposition " will likely take on an increasingly armed aspect in the face of brutal oppression , " a new report says			1
" there are signs that army units are increasingly identifying with protesters , especially where security forces are employing violence against unarmed demonstrators , " according to a report by the @entity19 , a think tank			1
" although the regime 's forces are not defeated and the army 's potential tears may prove to be small , the dynamics for greater problems are in place			1
given the widespread nature of the disturbances , the regime can not mass personnel in more than a few places			0
" the report , written by @entity19 defense fellow @entity33 and published monday , is entitled " @entity34			1
" it says the various units deployed to put down disturbances since mid-march are facing " unprecedented " challenges			0
" the continuing pressure of the demonstrations , which are liable to swell during @entity42 , will stretch the army still thinner , with more defections likely given the regime 's increasingly violent tactics , " the report said			1
" as the army becomes less reliable , strain will increase on the regime protection forces , stretching them further and tiring them faster			1
clashes within army units and between army and security forces may increase as well			2
and escalating regime violence will likely provoke a more violent response over time , fueled by armed defectors			2
" this grim assessment comes as two dozen people were killed overnight by security forces in various cities and towns and international condemnation against the regime rolls in toward the @entity66 regime			0
the army is a conscript force " in which largely @entity70 officers lead largely @entity72 soldiers , " and it has " traditionally been marked by a difficult relationship between officers and enlisted personnel , making it ill suited for the internal security missions it is now being given			1
" the government is dominated by the minority @entity70 , who are an offshoot of @entity81			1
" the security forces have not been able to permanently secure any area and have had to shuttle personnel from one flashpoint to another , sometimes over considerable distances			0
as disturbances have spread , additional divisions and brigades have been pulled into the struggle , " the report said			2
the report said the government appears " reluctant to order regular army units to fire on demonstrators , though it has done so in some cases where regime protection forces were inadequate			1
" but that produced " breakdowns in loyalty and cohesion among the army units so ordered			2
" " current trends suggest that the army 's loyalty and cohesion are not just fraying , but beginning to tear			2
" the opposition 's " center of gravity , " the report said , " is increasingly moving to the cities , " and that is a challenge , " forcing the regime to conduct a 360 degree defense			1
" with the exception of the @entity70 heartland in the northwest , the report said , no area appears secure			1
other than @entity121 , which has seen only " isolated protest , " " disturbances have erupted in more than 50 localities			0
" " subduing restive urban populations is a demanding and troop - intensive task , one that will become more difficult as demonstrations grow in size and as protesters or defectors take up arms			0
more forces will be required , and without adequate training , they are more likely to resort to violence early			0
more opportunities for violent , casualty - producing incidents will emerge as well			0
this was reportedly the case in @entity142 on sunday , as tanks and infantry fighting vehicles encountered protestors armed with sticks and stones , " he said			2
the government also faces problems along the borders , saying the flow of refugees into @entity153 has been embarrassing to the government , and both @entity158 and @entity159 " are potential sources of arms and fighters			0
" there have been several attacks on oil facilities and a train derailment , but the cause is not known			0
" if such incidents mount in numbers and seriousness , the regime will have to stretch its forces even thinner to protect key facilities , " the report said			0
the report thinks the opposition could adopt " an increasingly armed aspect in the face of brutal repression " as defectors join them			1
" as you get more defectors and guys who take their guns with them and they see people get killed when they yell ' @entity184 , ' or @entity185 is greatest , some people are going to say ' we 've got to do something , ' " @entity33 said .			0

report raises the specter of an " increasingly armed " opposition
the army is a largely conscript force led by @entity70 officers
*sabotage* and border control are other big *concerns*
