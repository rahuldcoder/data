a federal judge set bail friday for four of 10 men facing kidnapping charges after allegedly arranging the violent assaults of @entity7 husbands , the @entity0 said			1
judge @entity8 set bail at $ 1 million for @entity9 , while the other three -- @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12 -- had bail set at $ 500,000 , said @entity14 , a spokesman for the @entity0 , @entity15			1
@entity17 's attorney , @entity16 , told @entity18 on thursday he hoped his client would be able to leave jail and reunite with his family			1
@entity9 , rabbi @entity22 and rabbi @entity23 , along with seven other defendants , are accused of accepting tens of thousands of dollars to orchestrate the kidnappings of @entity27 husbands to persuade them to grant divorces to their wives , according to a criminal complaint			1
@entity9 is a sofer , a @entity27 scribe who transcribes the @entity33 and writes other religious documents , including divorce papers , according to his attorney			0
on wednesday , @entity8 set bail between $ 500,000 and $ 1 million for the two rabbis , along with four other defendants : @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
@entity8 also ordered home arrest -- with exceptions to leave for medical reasons , attorney meetings and religious purposes -- for all six , according to court documents			0
@entity17 , the rabbis and the other men were arrested after an @entity53 undercover investigation that led to a raid on october 9 , according to the criminal complaint			1
in one conversation with undercover @entity53 agents , the complaint alleges that @entity59 talked about forcing the divorces with the help of hired " tough guys , " who he said used plastic bags to cover the husbands ' heads , and electric cattle prods and karate to assault them			1
" i guarantee you that if you 're in the van , you 'd give a ' get ' to your wife			0
you probably love your wife , but you 'd give a ' get ' when they finish with you , " @entity59 told the undercover @entity53 agents			1
a " get " is a document that @entity27 law requires a husband to present to his wife to be issued a divorce , the complaint says			2
without it , a woman is considered an " agunah , " a chained woman bound to a man no matter how over their marriage might be			0
the implications of not having a get are serious in the @entity7 world			1
for @entity94 of other denominations , who interpret @entity27 law differently , the requirement of a get is less stringent or dismissed altogether			0
an @entity7 woman who does not receive a get , however , runs the risk of being shunned in her community and labeled an adulteress if she dares move on			2
and any future children she has are considered bastards permitted to marry only other bastards			0
the complaint says that @entity59 told the undercover @entity53 agents that his organization had kidnapped a husband every 12 to 18 months			1
the complaint also says that @entity23 told the agents , " you need special rabbis who are going to take this thing and see it through to the end			2
" " i can say that we are pleased the court accepted our bail proposal			2
i anticipate rabbi @entity118 will be released shortly , " said @entity116 , @entity117 's attorney			0
" the rabbi is a highly respected @entity121 scholar , and he steadfastly denies the allegations that he ordered violence , " said @entity116			0
@entity124 , @entity125 and @entity40 's attorneys all told @entity18 that they are confident their clients will have their bail processed and be out on a house arrest by the end of this week			2
@entity18 's calls to the other defendant 's attorneys were not answered			0
all 10 defendants pleaded not guilty last week			0
if convicted , they face a maximum sentence of life in prison .			0

@entity17 has bail set at $ 1 million ; 3 others get $ 500,000 bail each
he 's one of 10 accused in a scheme to kidnap @entity7 husbands
