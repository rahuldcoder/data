@entity0 , @entity1 -- saying it plans to lease aircraft and provide replacement workers , @entity3 on monday unveiled an ambitious contingency plan in preparation for the first of two strikes by the union members representing the airline 's cabin crews			1
the @entity14 's leadership aimed to ground the airline through its action , but " the flag will continue to fly , " said @entity18 , @entity3 chief executive , in a written statement			1
" around 60 percent of our customers will be able to fly as planned and many thousands more can be rebooked onto alternative @entity3 flights or onto rival airlines			1
" members of the unite union voted to strike for three days beginning march 20 , and for four more days beginning march 27			0
@entity3 said monday its contingency plans will allow about 45,000 customers to fly each day during the first strike period			1
" at this stage , the vast majority of flights between march 23 and march 31 remain in the schedule , and we will update customers due to fly during the second strike period after the first strike period has ended , " the statement said			2
" the airline is still available to hold further talks but wants customers to have early warning of its flying schedule to allow sufficient time for alternative travel arrangements to be made			0
" at @entity0 's @entity47 , more than 60 percent of @entity3 long - haul flights will be operated during the first strike period , the company said			0
in addition , it will operate all long - haul flights to @entity0 's @entity52 and more than half of the short - haul flights at @entity52			0
" the airline will operate some of its own short - haul flights at @entity47 , and will supplement its schedule by leasing up to 22 aircraft with pilots and crews from eight different airlines based in the @entity63 and @entity64 , " the statement said			1
" due to the numbers of cabin crew who have called in to offer their services over the weekend , the schedule will be slightly larger than we had originally anticipated , " @entity65 said			1
the airline said it has also made agreements with 40 other carriers to rebook customers free of charge during the strike period if their @entity3 flights are canceled			2
" we will continue to try to prevent this strike taking place , but we have reached a point when we must now offer some clarity to our customers who have waited with great patience since friday , when the strike dates were first announced , " @entity65 said in the @entity3 statement			2
" ... i recognize the frustration of customers booked for travel from march 27 onwards , when the second stoppage is due to begin , and we will do all we can to give them more clarity about their specific flight number once we start to understand just how many cabin crew are willing to work as normal			1
" the industrial action is over planned changes to cabin crew conditions , which @entity3 says will save the carrier more than Â£ 60 million ( approximately $ 90 million ) a year			1
@entity14 has said the plans call for working hours to be extended and crew levels to be cut , changes that it has said will damage customer service and the @entity3 brand			1
the airline 's management submitted a formal offer to the union thursday , @entity14 said , but added that the offer failed to address union concerns about crew numbers and service delivery			0
that prompted @entity14 officials to announce the strike dates friday			0
when that occurred , the airline took its offer off the table			0
the airline , for its part , also has rejected all union proposals so far , saying they would have saved the airline significantly less money than the airline 's own planned changes			0
@entity3 has opened an extra call center manned by volunteers to help customers , the monday statement said			2
" we remain absolutely determined to search for a sensible settlement and our door remains open to @entity14 , day or night			0
it is not too late for ... unite to call off this action and we will do all we can to reinstate some of the canceled flights , " @entity65 said in the company 's statement monday .			0
