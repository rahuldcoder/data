the @entity1 diet is a well - known weapon in the fight against heart disease , but exactly how effective is it ? to find out , researchers led by dr. @entity6 , from the @entity7 at the @entity8 of @entity9 , put the @entity1 diet to the test against a low - fat diet			1
they followed participants to track rates of heart attack , stroke and heart - disease - related death			0
after nearly five years , the results were so striking for one group that the study was stopped early , according to research published online by the @entity22			0
the group that showed the least heart problems and lowest rate of heart disease deaths ? those who ate a @entity1 diet high in extra-virgin olive oil			1
coming in at a close second were participants who ate a @entity1 diet high in nuts			1
compared with those eating the low - fat diet , the extra-virgin - olive - oil group showed a 30 % lower risk of having a heart attack , stroke or dying of heart disease after five years , while those consuming the @entity1 diet with more nuts showed a 28 % lower risk of these outcomes			1
@entity44 : @entity1 diet linked to lower child - asthma risk " we think the strength of this study comes from the fact that we measured hard outcomes and not just blood pressure or changes in cholesterol levels , " says @entity6			1
" we really believe the @entity1 diet lowers incidence of ( heart attack ) , stroke and cardiovascular deaths			2
" previous studies have linked @entity1 diets to fewer heart attacks and deaths from heart disease , but most of those have correlated people 's recall of their diet with heart - disease outcomes rather than randomly assigning participants to eat specific diets and then following them for heart - disease risk , as @entity6 and his colleagues did			1
in the study , the participants in the @entity1 diet groups agreed to replace red meat with white meat like chicken and eat three or more servings of fish each week , along with three or more servings of fruit and two or more servings of vegetables a day			2
the extra-virgin - olive - oil group also consumed more than four tablespoons of the oil a day , replacing regular olive oil with the extra-virgin variety , which contains more potentially heart - healthy compounds like polyphenols and vitamin - e tocopherols -- which can lower levels of inflammatory factors that contribute to heart disease -- in addition to oleic acids , which are lower in the saturated fat that can build up in blood vessels			1
the group that consumed more nuts was asked to eat a combination of 30 grams of walnuts , almonds and hazelnuts every day			0
these groups were also asked to stay away from sodas and red meats			0
the participants eating the low - fat diet ate three or more servings of fish or seafood a week and the same amount of fruit and vegetables as the @entity1 diet groups			2
they were discouraged from consuming more than two tablespoons of vegetable oils , including olive oil , each day			0
@entity44 : can olive oil help prevent stroke ? to ensure that other factors that could affect heart - disease rates were not playing a role , the researchers also adjusted for the total amount of calories the groups were eating , since obesity can be a major contributor to heart attack and stroke			2
even after making these adjustments , however , the olive - oil group showed statistically significant drops in heart - disease risk			0
and because the three groups were randomly assigned to their diets , @entity6 says that factors like the amount of exercise the participants did , or the medications they took , would be about the same in all three groups , and thus affect all participants equally			0
@entity6 says that the study has some limitations , most notably that the low - fat diet group may not have had as intense an intervention during the first part of the study as the @entity1 groups did , potentially biasing the results in favor of the @entity1 diet			0
some volunteers also dropped out , most of whom had higher body mass index on average , which may also skew the results toward a beneficial effect of the @entity1 diet , since the individuals who remained might have been more motivated to take care of their hearts to begin with			0
still , the findings add to the body of evidence that suggests the @entity1 diet can play an important role in protecting the heart , and should guide doctors and patients who want to avoid heart disease toward eating the foods that can help them the most			1
this story was originally published on @entity44			0
it 's the olive oil : @entity1 diet lowers risk of heart attack and stroke			1

eating a @entity1 diet high in extra-virgin olive oil has health benefits , a study suggests
a *mediterranean* diet high in nuts can also boost heart health
study participants showed fewer heart problems and lower deaths from heart disease
