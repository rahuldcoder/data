-- @entity2 lawmakers , meeting in emergency session this week , are set to change a controversial safe - haven law by sharply limiting the age at which a child can be dropped off with local authorities			1
thirty - five children have been dropped off at @entity2 hospitals since the law was enacted			1
the state @entity11 voted 41 to 6 wednesday to scrap the current version of the law -- which has no age limitation -- and instead establish a strict 30 - day age limit			1
state legislators have expressed concern that , if the law is not changed , @entity2 's social services system will be overwhelmed by older children delivered by parents from around the country who find they are unable to provide proper care			1
the legislature -- which has only one chamber , the @entity11 -- is expected to approve final passage of the revision this week before @entity2 gov. @entity30 signs it on friday			1
@entity2 's safe haven law was intended to allow parents to hand over an infant anonymously to a hospital without being prosecuted			1
of the 35 children who have been dropped off at hospitals since the law went into effect in september , however , not one has been an infant , officials say			0
all but six have been older than 10 , according to the @entity41			0
" the abandonment of these children -- and the harm it is causing them -- is an immediate concern , " said @entity42 , communications director for the governor			1
" some children have been begging their parents or guardians not to leave , " said social worker @entity48			1
" they may not really understand why they are being left at the hospital			0
but they know they are being left , and the parent or guardian might be fleeing			0
" on tuesday , a 15 - year - old girl was left at a hospital in @entity60 , located in the central part of the state			2
last week , a 14 - year - old boy and his 17 - year - old sister were dropped off at an @entity66 hospital ; the girl ran away from the hospital			0
earlier in the week , a father flew in from @entity70 , @entity71 , to leave his teenage son at a hospital , officials said			2
" please do n't bring your teenager to @entity2 , " @entity30 told parents in an interview with @entity0			1
" think of what you are saying			0
you are saying you no longer support them			0
you no longer love them			0
" state sen. @entity82 said lawmakers have been caught off guard by the number of teenagers dropped off under the law			0
" what you 've seen is an extraordinary cry for help from people all across the country , " he said			0
" @entity2 ca n't afford to take care of all of them			1
@entity2 would like to be able to , but they know that we ca n't so we are going to have to change the law			1
" five of the 35 abandoned children were brought to @entity2 from out of state			1
parents have traveled to @entity2 from @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity71 and @entity104			1
" we did n't think [ the law ] would be used to the extent it [ has been ] , " state sen. @entity105 said			2
" we did n't anticipate children coming from other states			2
" @entity111 drove from @entity104 to leave her teenage son at an @entity66 hospital			2
" do not judge me as a parent			2
i love my son and my son knows that , " @entity111 said			2
" there is just no help			0
there has n't been any help			0
" safe - haven laws allow distraught parents who fear their children are in imminent danger to drop them off at hospitals without being charged with abandonment			1
@entity2 was the last state in the country to pass such a law			1
but every other state included an age limit			2
there are 6,600 children in state custody in @entity2 , according to the @entity41			1
the per capita rate is one of the highest in the country , said @entity138 , director of the @entity139 for the @entity41 , " i think this has spurred some really healthy conversations about how do parents get the help that they need when they are struggling with some of these parenting issues , " he said			0
" and the message that we have been trying to get out is , ' do n't wait until it 's a crisis			0
reach out to your family and friends			0
