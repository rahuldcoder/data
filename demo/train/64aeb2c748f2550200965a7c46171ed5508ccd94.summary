-- the most startling thing about the music video for @entity6 band @entity4 's song @entity7 is n't the ghostly way the slow - panning camera turns human skin into a landscape			1
it 's not how the model , actor @entity14 , manages not to blink			0
and it 's not how at 3:30 in , with just a change in the lighting , the tone of the video abruptly gets dark and sinister			2
rather , the most startling thing about the @entity7 video is that none of those hyper - realistic shots are photos			1
it 's a virtual @entity26 scan of a human body , in this case , @entity6 actor @entity14			1
the knowledge that it 's virtual reality makes watching the video a little like seeing a @entity33 for the first time : your eyes initially registered a black - and - white photograph of monolithic scale , and it takes a few beats before you can believe that it 's a painting			1
@entity42 - based creative studio @entity41 — great name ! — made the video for the band ( and their friends ) @entity46 as an deep dive experiment into filmmaking for virtual reality			1
@entity50 has been using various kinds of @entity26 scanning technology for years — films like @entity54 , and @entity55 , relied on it			2
but for the @entity7 video , the creators used 94 cameras , whereas some @entity50 studios have been reported to use seven , to capture @entity61 's glowing skin in the most microscopic detail possible			1
" we were trying to push the realism of it , " says @entity63 of @entity41			0
the team is interested in the combination between photogrammetry — the science of taking 360 - degree measurements from photos — and panoramic high dynamic range lighting , which is like photographs of light from all positions and in myriad settings ( for example , it could be moon lighting , or desert lighting )			2
once they recorded both @entity61 's skin and a range of light , they worked with @entity42 visual effects studio @entity85 to merge all that visual data			1
the result is a high resolution , immortal , portrait of the actor 's skin			2
of course , the @entity41 team could have created a similar music video by just filming @entity61			1
" our ambition was to create the model at a really high resolution so we could take it to a games engine environment , " @entity95 says			0
" at the moment we 're treating it like a sculpture			0
but if you spend enough time you can rig it to be exactly like a face			0
the software is out there to animate it like a motion capture			0
" that said , the @entity41 team is n't trying to create a @entity26 human scan that will show up in a scripted film or video game			1
they create large scale , mind - bending installations out of light and sensors , like @entity122 , which turned an entire room into an instrument of light and green lasers			2
so their objective is to find a way to loop virtual humans into their artwork			1
" the exciting thing about virtual reality is it can give you a sense of presence that does n't exist in other technology — and it feels like we 're on the edge here , " @entity95 says			0
" the limiting factor is how realistic those little bubbles are			0
we 're interested in powerful experiences where you 're not bound by any of the restrictions of reality			0

a @entity42 studio has used @entity26 scans to create hyper - realistic images of the human body for a music video
the creators used 94 cameras and panoramic lighting to capture the skin 's microscopic details
the studio aims to *incorporate* virtual humans into their art in exciting ways
