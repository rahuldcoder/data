-- there 's always something strange about bumping into an ex. sometimes it can be satisfying -- perhaps they 're looking a bit shabby , or have obviously fallen on hard times			2
maybe they 've shacked up with someone new who , frankly , is n't much of a looker			0
other times the reverse is true -- it 's that day you 're late for work and have n't had time to shower , or maybe the time you 've had a drink too many and end up saying something embarrassing			2
but most confusing of all is when , in spite of the knowledge of everything that went wrong in the past , that surge of mutual longing just wells right up again			0
before you know it you 're meeting for a drink and , well , you know the rest			0
the problem for @entity32 , as for any serial daters , is that their exes are simply everywhere			1
after rattling through 10 managers in 10 years , barely a month goes by without some awkward encounter to set the mind wondering what might have been			0
of course we all know what happened this summer			0
fresh from ending a relationship with @entity43 that , while doomed from the start , seemed to be developing into something a little more substantial , @entity32 were confronted with the newly single big love of their lives			1
we 've all seen it happen : two people who seemed so perfect together , but parted in haste , and suddenly they 're both available			0
the outcome is inevitable , and so it was at @entity53			0
@entity54 moved all his stuff back in , started re-arranging the furniture and publicly re-affirming his undying love for the blue part of west @entity59			1
now here we are , barely six weeks into the new season , and this time around it seems a little different			0
@entity54 is as suave as ever , of course ; witty press conference quips and a debonair touchline demeanor go a long way to making everything in the garden look rosy			1
but there 's something oddly listless about his team			1
to begin with , there 's the question of the midfield			2
@entity74 , the darling of fantasy football league managers everywhere , has been the lynchpin of so many good things about @entity32 since he signed ; but from the moment @entity54 took charge the former @entity81 maestro 's place has looked in doubt			1
meanwhile , fellow attacking midfielders @entity83 and @entity84 , while outrageously gifted , seem to pose more questions than answers			0
how do they play together ? do they have the physical stature to impose themselves on more abrasive opponents ? add in the return of another attacking midfielder , the exciting @entity93 , loaned out successfully to @entity94 last term , along with the addition of buccaneering wide man @entity97 , and there is a wealth of riches in the middle of the park			0
odd then that @entity54 chose to gazump one of @entity32 's most recent and perhaps bitter exes , @entity105 boss @entity104 , and divert -- you guessed it -- yet another attacking midfielder , @entity110 , to @entity53			1
how to fit any combination of these together into a usable whole , not least in the mayhem of @entity115 's rough and ready @entity114 , is quite a conundrum			2
right now @entity54 's first choice midfield is anyone 's guess			1
then there 's the front line			2
the football jury returned a verdict on @entity124 some time ago , and few would describe his time at @entity32 in anything more than tepid terms at best			1
the fact that @entity54 has kept him on may owe more to an absence of realistic suitors than a desire to be the one who finally made things work with the @entity135 , but keep him he has			1
@entity136 has also struggled somewhat since joining from @entity137 , but while reports suggested he might have been off elsewhere , possibly to @entity139 , he has also stuck around			0
blog : are @entity142 still the team to beat ? @entity143 , another fantasy league favorite after a prolific season at @entity146 , seemed like the kind of rough diamond , with more than a little of @entity149 about his physique , that @entity54 could make shine			1
but after an agonizing missed spot - kick at the end of 10 - man @entity32 's spirited @entity156 final defeat against @entity158 , he will now be lining up in the blue shirt of @entity160 this season			1
with another former @entity32 man , @entity163 , setting @entity164 alight with his goals , it seems odd to let such potential go			2
@entity166 then there was the pursuit of @entity169			0
yes the @entity142 striker had frustrated former boss @entity171 and needled his club 's own fans more than once with his apparent desire to flee @entity175 , and new manager @entity176 offered mixed messages about the forward 's future			1
but there always seemed something slightly implausible about the idea of the @entity183 letting @entity169 join one of their title rivals			0
and like @entity139 's myopic lust for @entity192 striker @entity191 , @entity32 's pursuit of @entity169 seemed to become an obsession , while other possible targets such as @entity188 and @entity189 slipped through the @entity196 ' net			1
finally , veteran striker @entity197 put pen to paper			0
while it is fair to say the 32 year old was unlikely to have been at the top of @entity54 's summer shopping list , he brings formidable experience and undoubted talent to the front			1
whether the flesh matches the mind and spirit will become clear in time , but this has not been the impact signing one would usually associate with a @entity32 summer			2
none of this may have mattered much a few years ago , when the strength of this squad would probably have been enough to see the team through to a top two berth			0
but the @entity114 is quite a different place to the one @entity54 left			2
in fact it 's fair to say it 's a pretty different place to one of even a year ago			0
yes , @entity171 's departure may yet have a negative impact on @entity142 , who have n't exactly handed @entity176 the keys to the vault ; but while @entity230 also have major changes to absorb , they look fiercely competitive on paper			0
elsewhere a resurgent @entity192 , a surprisingly effective @entity139 , and an intriguing @entity105 mean this year 's race is a tough one to call			0
@entity32 are in the mix , of that there is no doubt ; but after their worst start to a @entity114 campaign since owner @entity241 took over it is difficult to cast them as favorites			1
@entity243 and @entity43 perhaps the most interesting element in all of this is the performance of two other @entity32 exes			2
@entity243 , fresh from a triumphant season in @entity249 in which @entity250 cruised to the @entity252 title and very nearly sprung a shock against @entity254 in the @entity255 , has taken the helm at @entity257 with steely assurance			0
three wins from four @entity261 games and a crushing 6 - 1 @entity255 victory over @entity263 in @entity264 mark a team that looks well on track			1
@entity243 's departure from @entity32 was perhaps the most difficult to comprehend of all of this most capricious of clubs ' break - ups			1
given his record he looks more than capable of delivering the success @entity257 fans crave			0
meanwhile , down in @entity278 's @entity277 region , @entity43 's start at @entity274 -- with a markedly changed team -- has been hugely impressive			2
the @entity279 appear to have gelled immediately , as a series of dynamic and passionate performances fired them to the top of @entity284 with a 100 % start			0
and that was before they dismantled a supremely talented @entity289 side in their first @entity255 tie			0
@entity43 -- the most unloved of former @entity32 partners -- looks to have found his perfect match in the shadow of @entity294			2
as a bewildered looking @entity32 side left the field on wednesday after their shock 2 - 1 home @entity255 defeat to @entity301 , it was hard not to wonder if -- in the heat of the moment -- they had fallen back into the arms of the wrong ex. that sensation was only compounded when the @entity307 accused his team of lacking " emotional maturity " in a post-match interview			1
he was quick to shoulder the blame for the defeat in later exchanges , but there was a sense of alarm bells quietly ringing , especially with the news that @entity241 had joined his manager in the home dressing room for the post-match post-mortem			1
after a fractious , draining and unfulfiling 2012 - 203 season with @entity257 , which @entity54 himself admitted was the " worst of his career " , was a rekindled romance with a past love , however heartfelt , simply chasing a passionate affair that had already run its course ? early days it may be , but it will be interesting to see whether chapter two of this great romance evolves into another bitter divorce or a case of happily ever after .			1

@entity54 watched his @entity32 team lose 2 - 1 to @entity301 on wednesday
@entity54 's first spell as @entity32 manager ended with a 1 - 1 draw at home to @entity344
