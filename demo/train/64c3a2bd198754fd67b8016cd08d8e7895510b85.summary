-- maybe it is the year of the fox , but as @entity5 executive editor @entity4 said , that 's not stopping all the other forest critters -- and their habitat -- from showing up in @entity9 decor			1
" the fox is having this huge moment			0
in the past it 's been the squirrel and the owls and deer always have their place in fall and into winter , " she said			0
" it 's part of this much larger theme , a full - on woodland sensibility			2
" from big box stores to craft stores , department stores to chic boutiques , all manner of @entity9 ornaments and decor items are surrounded by bits of nature - inspired elements , she said			1
" i do n't think woodland is going away , " she said			2
what is " woodland ? " it 's a decor trend that brings the woods indoors			1
think about what kinds of things you would find in a forest , @entity4 said			0
everything from pine cones , acorns , tree bark , mushrooms and moss to all styles of furry and feathered creatures			2
in fact , home decor blogger @entity50 routinely ventures to her @entity54 back yard for a touch of woodland to augment her christmas tree and the rest of her house during the holidays			1
" if you expand on nature , you really ca n't go wrong , " she said			0
@entity63 finds the texture of just - clipped holly , bare sticks and conifer branches to be the perfect starting point when decorating for @entity9			1
that does n't mean that every corner of her house looks like some kind of enchanted forest			0
" i do n't think you have to stick with one theme for your entire house			0
i think each room can feel a little different when you 're decorating for @entity9 , " she said , but what ties them together is a wintery inspiration			1
there is plenty of room for cherished family ornaments , playful , childlike decor and sophisticated decor that adults appreciate , she said			2
" while it may seem as if the theme has been in the marketplace for a while now , " said @entity89 , vice president and fashion director for the @entity91 at @entity92 , " ( woodland decor ) has evolved			1
" what he 's noticed in the @entity9 ornaments and decor items offered at @entity92 is a saturation and refinement of colors , a new and healthy dose of sparkle and an increase in the kinds of materials used to make them			1
and when it comes to decorating the tree , @entity89 points out that there is no one rule of thumb			0
" some decorate by theme , some by color and some prefer an eclectic theme with each ornament having special meaning , " he said			0
and when he buys ornaments for the department store , he keeps in mind that very few people go out and buy all their @entity9 tree ornaments at once			2
" customers are looking for holiday decorations that support their existing room decor , " he said			1
" the nature - based items we offer are elevated and refined			2
" many homes may already have some of these woodland decor elements displayed , @entity4 said			1
faux taxidermy , antlers , moss and pine cones have become everyday decor			2
" ( the woodland theme ) is huge in nursery decor as well as @entity9 decor , i mean , it 's enormous , " she said			1
when those elements are blended with holiday decor , instead of covered up , " it feels like an extension of what you 're already doing , " she said			1
designer @entity149 works with colors she already has in her home , like blues and greens , when she decorates for @entity9			2
southern cypress and pine provide the perfect texture to balance out the smooth , shiny ornaments and twinkling lights of either modern or traditional decor she said , and their rich green tones make an appearance in her holiday decor			1
the formality of peacocks , however , is her secret to really bringing color to her @entity9 decorations			1
" i think the peacock brings colors than we typically see with ( other ) critters , " she said			0
@entity173 can range from whimsical to high style , @entity4 said , and had truly taken hold in the decor world during the last decade			0
one of @entity178 's favorite examples of the woodland style comes from a recent find : @entity181 made into a paper chain for a @entity9 tree garland			1
" it just takes the literal natural element and brings it to a very traditional @entity9 decorating idea , " she said			2
@entity63 ascribes to some classic woodland decor tricks that @entity4 described : bare twigs tucked into @entity9 trees and very au curant pine cones , birch bark and shed deer antlers			1
with a decorator for a mom , @entity63 's five children have learned to expect different looking @entity9 decor each year			1
" this year i went for a less - is - more approach , " she said			0
the simplicity of a plain , natural pine swag across her mantel , a color scheme of green , white and gold and even some paper snowflakes set the mood @entity63 hoped for			0
but what if there are some woodland elements that kind of creep you out ? @entity63 remembers the mounted deer head that played a central part in her grandmother 's holiday decor			1
" that is a vivid memory for me " she said			0
" they put a @entity220 nose on it and tinsel on the antlers			0
it always really disturbed me			0
" @entity225 knows what she means			0
" if you happen to have a moose above the mantle , which i have seen , " she said , " some people go beyond leaving them as they are			0
" some wives , she said , might compromise with their husbands over a taxidermied woodland decor element			1
perhaps , she said , the solution could be , " ok , let 's keep the moose head , but let 's paint it white to bring in that modern element			0
" " it 's just how you approach it , " she said			0
" we can definitely work around something as long as it 's done with tasteful grace			0
" all that hunting trophy really needs for @entity9 , @entity225 said , is a natural garland around its neck			2
