spies with surveillance agencies in the @entity2 and @entity3 may have spent time undercover as orcs and blood elves , infiltrating video games like " @entity8 " in a hunt for terrorists " hiding in plain sight " online			1
that 's the finding of the most recent round of documents released by @entity17 leaker @entity16 to @entity3 newspaper @entity18			1
agents from the @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 and @entity24 's @entity23 infiltrated @entity8 and virtual world " @entity25 , " as well as collecting information on the @entity29 gaming network , according to the documents			1
a 2008 @entity17 memo called online gaming a " target - rich communications network " where terrorists could communicate " in plain sight			2
" none of the newly leaked documents , published this time in conjunction with @entity38 and the @entity39 , mentioned specific terrorist activity foiled via the projects			1
but apparently so many agents were engaged in playing video games for national security that a " deconfliction " group was created to make sure government agents were n't accidentally spying on each other			1
unlike traditional console and desktop games in which players compete in a closed environment , massively multiplayer online games ( mmos ) allow players from around the world to team up and play together , often in real time using in - game communication tools			2
" @entity8 " is the most popular online role - playing game ever			1
it peaked at about 12 million subscribers in 2010 and still has more than 7 million , according to @entity62			0
it 's unclear whether the agencies had surveillance capabilities within the massively multi-player games that normal players would not			2
a spokesman for @entity62 , which owns " @entity8 , " told @entity18 it is unaware of any surveillance having taken place			2
" if it was , it would have been done without our knowledge or permission , " the spokesman said			0
on friday , @entity77 announced it was strengthening encryption across many of its services in an effort to push back against " government snooping			0
" and monday , the company joined @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 issuing a public statement asking the world 's governments to rein in online surveillance			0
while acknowledging the scope and popularity of online gaming , some security experts were questioning monday whether spying on digital playgrounds is either wise or effective			0
" i think i 've heard it all now , " wrote @entity3 security analyst @entity101			0
" obviously online games which include chat or @entity106 facilities do provide a method for people to communicate ... but how practical is it to have a team of spies sniffing around ' @entity8 ' to see what they might find ? " he wrote			1
opinion : why we should watch out for the watchmen of government secrecy " why are n't they also snooping -- maybe they are ! -- on the chess app i have on my smartphone ? perhaps every time i mess up my @entity125 @entity124 defence it 's not really an indication that i 'm a lousy chess student , but instead a coded message for my opponent to launch an attack on @entity131 systems in the @entity125 ? " @entity16 , 30 , has admitted he was the source behind the leak of classified @entity17 documents , which revealed the existence of top - secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic e-mails and telephone calls in the @entity2 and monitor the cell phone and @entity142 activity of overseas residents			1
a former contractor with the agency , he is wanted in the @entity2 on espionage charges			0
@entity77 fights back against @entity17 ' snooping '			0
