-- a @entity2 woman involved with a group described as a religious cult pleaded guilty in the starvation death of her son , but insisted that the charges be dropped when he is resurrected			1
under terms of her plea agreement , @entity10 's charges will be dropped if her son rises from the dead			1
the condition was made a part of @entity10 's plea agreement , officials said			1
she entered the plea monday in @entity20 , @entity2 , to a first - degree felony count of child abuse resulting in death , her attorney , @entity18 , said tuesday			1
@entity10 , a member of a group called @entity25 , believes @entity26 , her year - old son , will rise again , and as part of her plea agreement , authorities agreed to the clause			1
" she certainly recognizes that her omissions caused the death of her son , " @entity18 said			2
" to this day , she believes it was @entity34 's will and he will be resurrected and this will all take care of itself			2
she realizes if she 's wrong , then everyone has to take responsibility ... and if she 's wrong , then she 's a failure as a mother and the worst thing imaginable has happened			2
i do n't think that , mentally , she 's ready to accept that			2
" under the plea agreement , @entity10 , 22 , must testify against four other one @entity25 members who are also facing charges , including first - degree murder , in @entity26 's death			1
at her sentencing , set for august , she will receive a 20 - year sentence , which will be suspended except for the time she has already served behind bars , @entity18 said			0
she must also undergo deprogramming and psychiatric counseling			0
in court monday , it was clarified that the " resurrection clause " would apply only in the case of @entity26 's actual resurrection -- not a perceived reincarnation , @entity18 said			1
" this has never come up in the history of @entity63 law , as far as i 've seen , " @entity18 said , adding that the clause was " very important to her			0
" " on one level , she certainly is competent to stand trial , because she does recognize that as far as her legal entanglements are concerned , this is a grand - slam resolution for her , " @entity18 said			0
" on the other hand , she 's still brainwashed , she 's still delusional as far as the teachings and influence of this cult , and she certainly is going to benefit with professional help and deprogramming			0
" @entity10 and the others are accused of denying @entity26 food after the group 's leader , a 40 - year - old woman who goes by the name @entity83 @entity82 , decreed the boy was a demon since he refused to say " amen " after meals , @entity18 said			1
" @entity10 would cling to him every day and try to get him to say ' amen , ' " @entity18 said			0
eventually , queen @entity82 ordered that @entity10 be separated from the child , he said			0
@entity26 is believed to have died in december 2006 , court documents allege			1
following his death , the group members put the boy 's body in a back room , and " everyone was directed to come in and pray , " according to the documents			1
" @entity83 told everyone that ' @entity34 was going to raise @entity26 from the dead			1
' @entity26 remained in the room for an extended period of time ( in excess of one week )			1
the resurrection never took place			2
" authorities believe the boy 's body was then placed into a wheeled suitcase along with mothballs and fabric - softener sheets , documents said			1
prosecutors allege @entity82 opened the suitcase periodically and sprayed its interior with @entity113 to mask the decomposition odor			2
the group then moved to @entity117 , @entity118 , and befriended a man who agreed to take care of their luggage before they left , documents said			0
the body was found in april 2008 , still inside the suitcase , in the man 's storage shed			1
all five @entity128 members were set to stand trial monday			2
the case against the others has been postponed , @entity18 said , as @entity82 and another woman lack attorneys and must either obtain one or waive their right to counsel			0
@entity18 added that @entity82 has suggested , though not said outright , that @entity34 is representing her			0
court documents say @entity10 joined one mind ministries after @entity26 's birth in 2005			1
@entity18 described her as a petite , soft - spoken woman who rejected her family 's @entity139 religion , became a devout @entity141 and wanted to raise her son in that religion			0
" she did n't want to have to work or go to school			2
she just wanted to take care of her son , and they offered her all this , " he said			0
the group insisted she wear a uniform the colors of royalty : white , tan and blue ; give up her cell phone ; stop referring to her family members by name ; and not leave her home on her own , among other things , he said			2
" they really isolated her , brainwashed her , and you see what happened			0
" @entity10 's mother , @entity162 , notified various agencies that her grandson was missing after she traveled to @entity165 in february 2008 to find her daughter , court documents said			0
@entity162 told authorities that when she spoke to @entity168 and asked about @entity26 , her daughter replied , " he 's gone			1
he 's lost , " but gave no further information			0
@entity18 said he realized right away after consulting with @entity10 that he needed to communicate her story to the public and to prosecutors			0
" once you get to understanding the story , understanding what @entity10 went through , and her intentions ... it becomes quite clear that @entity10 , although many may not think her hands are clean , a reasonable , rational person would have some sympathy			0

@entity26 is believed to have died in december 2006
one @entity25 members prayed for his resurrection
when he did n't rise , his body was put in a suitcase with mothballs
