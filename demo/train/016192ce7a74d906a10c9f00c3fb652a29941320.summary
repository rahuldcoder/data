-- a coalition of protesters marched saturday under sunny skies to a @entity5 base north of @entity6 to voice its opposition to the @entity9 's use of armed drones in @entity11			1
" people are pretty upset about the idea that @entity9 will be developing this drone warfare , " said @entity12 , executive director of @entity13			1
some 700 representatives of " a whole range of different anti-war movements " participated , many of them arriving in buses from around the country , he said			2
they made the 4 - mile march from the town of @entity26 to @entity27 , about 130 miles north of @entity6 , he said			1
the coalition also includes members of the @entity30 , the @entity31 and @entity32			1
their march was held two days after the @entity5 announced that it has begun remotely operating its @entity35 unmanned aerial vehicles deployed to @entity11 from the @entity37 airbase			1
before that , they had been operated from @entity40 in @entity41 , where the @entity43 drone program is located			1
in a statement , @entity9 's @entity44 said its reaper drone , which is operated in @entity11 under the command of @entity54 and @entity55 , " is undoubtedly helping to save the lives of our forces , our allies and those of countless @entity11 civilians			1
" but the @entity44 itself , in a 2011 @entity56 , raised concerns over the increasing use of drones			1
" the robot does not care that the target is human or inanimate , terrorist or freedom fighter , savage or barbarian , " it said			0
" a robot can not be driven by anger to carry out illegal actions such as those at @entity68			0
" in theory , therefore , autonomy should enable more ethical and legal warfare			0
however , we must be sure that clear accountability for robotic thought exists and this in itself raises a number of difficult debates			0
" is a programmer guilty of a war crime if a system error leads to an illegal act ? where is the intent required for an accident to become a crime ? " noting that the use of unmanned aerial vehicles is increasing , the report called for the establishment of clear policies outlining their acceptable use			0
" there is a danger that time is running out , " it concluded			0
" is debate and development of policy even still possible , or is the technological genie already out of the ethical bottle , embarking us all on an incremental and involuntary journey towards a terminator - like reality ? " experts in other countries have grappled with similar questions			0
the use of drones " builds resentment , facilitates terrorist recruitment and alienates those we should seek to inspire , " said @entity107 , former @entity43 ambassador to @entity54 , in an editorial published last october in the @entity109			1
there is no way to be certain that there are no cases of mistaken identity or innocent deaths , he said			0
drone use can radicalize populations , said @entity107 , who now is executive director of the @entity124 at @entity125 and a senior adviser to the @entity127			2
he noted that the @entity43 has no monopoly on the technology			0
" imagine @entity130 killing @entity132 separatists that it deemed terrorists or @entity134 launching drone strikes on @entity136 , " he says			2
" what would we say ? " but a former @entity5 " @entity35 " pilot , @entity139 , who has worked in the @entity43 and @entity9 , defended the program from its critics			1
" i 'm not 100 % sure what they are marching against , " he told @entity0 in a telephone interview			1
there is little difference between drones and piloted planes , said the pilot , who joined the @entity149 in 2006 in @entity41 and left in 2011			1
" same rules of engagement , same laws of armed conflict , same crews			0
" it 's just one is manned and one is unmanned			0
" if drone use is indeed immoral , does that mean it would be immoral to fire at an enemy from a naval vessel 50 miles off the coast , asked @entity139			2
" where do you draw the line ? " @entity139 is now working as a vice president in charge of operations at unmanned experts , a company that specializes in drone training , equipment and business development			2
a study published last year by two @entity43 universities argued that the " dominant narrative " that drones are " surgically precise and effective " is false			2
the strikes have killed far more people than the @entity43 has acknowledged , traumatized innocent people and largely been ineffective , according to the study by the law schools of @entity183 and @entity184			0
@entity0 's @entity185 contributed to this report from @entity6			0

" no to drones , " says the @entity31
the march came two days after the @entity5 announced its program shift
" i 'm not 100 % sure what they are marching against , " a former @entity5 drone pilot says
