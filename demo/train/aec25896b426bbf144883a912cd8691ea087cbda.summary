@entity0 was 19 when she became @entity1 in 2008 , one of the youngest beauty queens ever to win the national title			1
she used that platform to speak about what for her was a very sensitive subject : eating disorders			2
" i realized what 's making an impact on other people 's lives is not this perfect image of the @entity15 ideal , " she said			2
" it 's a true human story of struggle and triumph			2
" unlike many of her fellow contestants , @entity0 did n't spend her childhood competing in pageants			1
instead , the @entity24 native dreamed of performing as a professional ballerina			1
the pressures of trying to live out that dream led her into the nightmare of anorexia nervosa at age 12			1
anorexia nervosa is an eating disorder that causes people to obsess about their weight and the food they eat , according to the @entity36			1
people with the disease try to maintain a weight that 's unhealthy for their age and height			1
going to extremes : eating disorders by the numbers " i was in ballet from just 3 years old			1
so from a very early age , the ideal female body type was very thin , " said @entity0 , now a political science major at @entity48 in @entity49 , @entity50			1
" that was the first image i had in my brain ; i always equated beauty and worth with being skinny			2
" @entity0 excelled in her studies while training in ballet , tap and jazz seven days a week			1
her older brother had multiple learning disabilities , so she felt pressure to perform extraordinarily well			2
at 12 , she left home to study at the @entity64 , hoping it would lead to a professional career			1
it was her first time living away from her parents , and her body was developing as she entered puberty -- a risky time , experts say , for the onset of anorexia			1
@entity0 's self - esteem began to plummet quickly as she was overwhelmed by panic and a fear of not achieving perfection			1
once priding herself on a high level of performance and over-achievement , she was now questioning every move			2
" i became more self - aware and all of the sudden felt this panic , like maybe i was n't good enough or maybe my life was going to collapse around me and i could n't accomplish this dream , " she said			2
adding to her anxiety , @entity0 's mother was diagnosed that summer with breast cancer , a condition she was treated for and survived			1
the pre-teen looked for an answer to her out - of - control world from her peers			2
what she saw was a struggle many dancers face : the pressure to be thin			2
" i looked at what they were doing , and so many of them were throwing away their lunches and not eating			2
i thought , ' if i can at least be thin , i know i can be successful at ballet			2
' " she began to severely restrict her food intake and admits this gave her a sense of triumph			2
" i remember the first day i decided to throw away my lunch , and i drank a @entity110 instead , " she said			2
" i felt really good			2
i remember that day and the choice i made			2
and it was a choice made out of fear , not logic			2
" this kind of behavior is n't uncommon among younger girls who are dealing with transitions in their life , said @entity120 , a psychology professor at @entity48			0
" for them , it 's not ( as ) much about looks and weight than it is with controlling something			0
" an estimated 10 million women and 1 million men in the @entity15 battle anorexia or bulimia , according to the @entity131			1
and these disorders carry the highest mortality rate of any mental illness			0
@entity0 scoured the internet for tricks on how to avoid social situations involving food and frequently looked through images of celebrities for " thinspiration			1
" " i was living off coffee , @entity143 and gum , " she said			0
" every once in a while , i 'd have vegetables , fruit or a spoonful of peanut butter			0
" she was consuming fewer than 900 calories daily , less than half the amount recommend for the average woman			0
her hunger for more control morphed from starving herself to increasing her exercise routine in addition to her demanding ballet schedule			0
" it was many days of small steps toward something extreme			0
it was a recipe for disaster and a really serious and painful situation			0
" though anorexia most frequently occurs during teen years or young adulthood , it also may develop during childhood or later in life , experts say			1
@entity0 was competing with the most talented dancers out there , all with dreams of becoming the prima ballerina			1
" you were seen as elite if you engaged in some of those kinds of behaviors , " @entity0 said			1
" it was something that most girls did , and if you ate like a normal person , you were looked down upon			0
" her obsession with thinness worsened over the next three years			1
by then , the 5 - foot - 8 dancer had lost 30 pounds from her already tiny body			0
she admits she was pleased when family and friends noticed her shockingly thin frame			0
" i felt like a shell of a human being			0
it was n't happiness , " @entity0 said			1
" internally , i knew there was something seriously wrong with me , but i did n't know how to stop			0
" undernourished and extremely depressed , she hazily recalls the day her mother picked her up from high school and forcibly took her to a doctor			0
@entity0 angrily insisted that she was healthy , but her test results told another story			1
for the next two years , she was under intensive outpatient care , routinely meeting with her interdisciplinary team of a nutritionist , a psychologist and an eating - disorder specialist			1
" at first , it was really yo - yo , especially with my food intake , " she said			0
" it 's extremely difficult to unlearn all of that bad thinking			0
i had to work on visualizing a life outside of ballet if i wanted to get better			0
" @entity0 left the performing company and scaled back on dancing to focus on getting better			1
beauty pageants seem an odd fit for a recovering anorexic , but they offered @entity0 an avenue for moving forward			1
at age 17 , her health was improving , and pageant competitions could win her a college scholarship			1
back home in @entity222 , @entity24 , she entered the miss @entity224 pageant and , to her great surprise , won			0
but her eating disorder physician was concerned			0
" i told her this could be triggering for someone who has a history of an eating disorder , " said @entity228 , medical director at the @entity229 in nearby @entity230			0
" she had to be very cautious to ensure she 's not setting herself up for a difficult backslide			0
" that 's not the way @entity0 saw it			1
during the next year , as a freshman in college , she began to publicly speak about her struggles with anorexia , hoping to destigmatize the illness			1
@entity245 came the @entity247 pageant			0
at 18 , @entity0 was the youngest contestant ; she won the crown over several pageant veterans			1
her new responsibilities forced her to leave college , and she spent six months traveling the country to attend national conferences on eating disorders			0
" i learned so much about the illness ; it was a really good educational period for me , " she said			0
" from hearing other people 's recovery stories , i learned how to share my own personal struggles			0
" when @entity0 entered the @entity1 pageant , she was placed on a workout regimen monitored by her nutritionist			1
she was motivated to achieve her goals the healthy way			0
" of course , i felt pressure ; i 'm thinking , ' gosh , if i get called to the top 10 , i 'm going to be in my swimsuit in front of 12 million people			1
' it was scary , but i was thinking of being healthy first			0
i knew that was more important than anything else			0
" written off as the underdog by peers and judges , @entity0 felt a greater freedom to be herself			1
" i actually think that was more attractive to the judges			0
there were several girls who came up to me during the week and shared previous struggles with an eating disorder			0
it opened the door to many great conversations			0
" " she used the topic of battling anorexia as a sincere commitment to help others struggling , and as a tool to solidify her own recovery , " @entity228 said			2
" she was more surprised than anyone when she actually won			0
" since stepping into the national spotlight , @entity0 has continued to spread awareness as a role model for young girls			1
she 's launched the @entity297 , which provides financial aid to those seeking treatment for eating disorders			1
" those who struggle with substance abuse can get off their drug and never face it again , " @entity0 said			1
" but for somebody who overcomes an eating disorder , you have to face it every day , multiple times a day			0

the pressures of trying to be a ballerina led @entity0 into anorexia nervosa at age 12
anorexia frequently occurs during teen years , but it may also develop during childhood
