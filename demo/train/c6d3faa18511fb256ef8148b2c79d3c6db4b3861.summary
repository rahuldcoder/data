-- ten years ago this week , then - secretary of state @entity1 declared that genocide had been committed in @entity3 and that the government of @entity5 and the janjaweed bore responsibility for those acts			1
even though it did not actually trigger a legal obligation to act , many hoped that using the " g word " meant that the @entity13 was crossing the @entity14 and committing itself to stopping the violence in @entity3 , @entity5 's most troubled region			1
the janjaweed , however , are still at large in @entity3 -- and with the @entity5 government 's help , they are now arguably more powerful than ever			2
it is this reality that makes it so disturbing that the @entity20 recently declared that getting weapons out of this militant group 's hands is no longer " relevant " to their work			0
after all , janjaweed fighters formed the backbone of the genocidal attack forces that the @entity5 government unleashed on @entity3 11 years ago			1
when the spotlight finally fell on the ethnically motivated killing in the region , it was clear that these men committed some of the very worst crimes against humanity			0
the looming specter of their attacks kept displaced @entity3 refugees trapped in camps and , as long as the janjaweed were at large , their victims would not be able to go home			2
in recognition of this reality , the @entity45 ordered the @entity5 government to take steps to disarm the janjaweed , but it did little toward this goal			2
fast forward to last month , and the @entity45 voted to keep peacekeepers in @entity3 for another 10 months			1
at a time when budgets are already stretched , the vote was hailed as a final lease of life for the mission , which has been accused of covering up its failure to protect @entity3 civilians			2
but buried among small technical tweaks to the mandate 's language , the @entity45 made a huge concession to the government of @entity5 by deeming aspects of the peacekeepers ' work -- including monitoring , verifying , and promoting efforts to disarm the militias -- " no longer relevant			1
" why has this happened ? some have argued that any attempt to disarm the janjaweed was doomed to fail because , in practice , taking away their weapons would also mean taking weapons away from @entity3 's powerful @entity78 tribes			2
others said that it was hard to know who exactly the " janjaweed " were			0
but with its latest resolution , the @entity20 seems to be saying , in effect , the janjaweed are no longer of concern			0
the facts on the ground show just the opposite			0
today , the same brutal forces that carried out those crimes remain the primary threat to civilian security in @entity3			1
indeed , the janjaweed have been openly embraced by the government of @entity5			0
and despite for years denying it had any connection to the fighters marauding across @entity3 , the government has , under the banner of the @entity101 , allegedly welcomed many of these brutal fighters back to the scene of their old crimes , in uniform and newly armed and equipped			1
already this year , the @entity101 have reportedly been in @entity3 , @entity107 , and @entity108 , where they have been accused of burning civilian areas to the ground , raping women , and displacing @entity114 civilians from their homes			0
in exchange , the @entity5 government has showered these janjaweed reincarnate with praise and rewards			0
by giving these forces a new name and official status , the @entity5 government seems to have convinced the @entity45 that @entity124 are no longer living under the threat of janjaweed attacks			1
just as bad , the @entity20 seems reluctant to even use the word janjaweed , at least according to @entity128 , a former spokeswoman for the operation , who wrote in @entity130 that " since the deployment of @entity134 in 2008 , only one mention of the word janjaweed has appeared in the more than 30 reports that [ the @entity20 ] has issued on @entity3			0
" in declaring that efforts to disarm these fighters are no longer relevant , the @entity20 effectively endorsed the @entity5 government 's flimsy claim that things in @entity3 are getting better			1
meanwhile , the killing continues .			0
