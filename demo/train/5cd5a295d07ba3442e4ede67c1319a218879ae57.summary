the leaves that go into a cup of @entity3 tea play a surprisingly complex role in the history of @entity7			1
it started with a single camellia sinesis plant brought from @entity10 in 1824 by the @entity11 , who had colonized the island then known as @entity3 in 1801			2
the plant was to be displayed in the @entity15 outside @entity16 in the country 's lush interior -- but it has since grown into a $ 1.5 billion export business for the teardrop shaped island nation off @entity23 's southern tip. alongside the agricultural production of tea , which accounts for 2.5 % of the country 's $ 60 billion gdp , tea tourism is also emerging as a popular experience for travelers			1
in 1867 @entity33 coffee planter @entity31 , the man who would be recognized as the pioneer of @entity7 's tea industry , planted 19 acres of tea near @entity16 at an altitude of around 500 meters			1
in the 1860s , however , @entity7 was the world 's largest coffee producer and few paid attention to @entity31			2
two years later came the first seeds of change when @entity44 , or coffee rust , was detected on the island			0
within 10 years , this lethal fungus led to financial ruin for the island 's @entity11 coffee planters			0
roughly 1,700 left for @entity51 while the remaining 400 or so switched to growing tea			0
sir @entity53 famously commented that " the tea fields of @entity3 are as true a monument to courage as is the lion at @entity58			0
" tea industry starts the @entity60 brought @entity62 women from @entity23 to work as tea pluckers , ushering in the next chapter of human suffering on these lush green acres			0
by 1890 , the year @entity67 arrived to purchase tea estates , 23,000 tons of tea were exported to @entity71 's tea auctions			1
@entity3 had become an island synonymous with tea			0
@entity3 won independence from @entity11 rule in 1948 but the tea industry remained a colonial domain			0
when government pressure led to the selection of six @entity7 men as the first indigenous tea tasters in 1950 , one of them , @entity85 , remembers being told by @entity11 colleagues , " you all eat too much curry , it ruins the taste buds ! " even as the island nation became the world 's largest tea exporter in 1965 , the industry itself was still dominated by the @entity11 , who exported the tea as raw material and branded it overseas			1
@entity85 began dreaming of packaging and marketing 100 % pure @entity3 tea , dispensing with middlemen and keeping more profits for his country , which officially became known as @entity7 in 1972			1
two destructive rounds of land reform in the 1970s delayed those dreams and nearly wiped out @entity7 's tea industry , but in 1988 @entity85 founded @entity106			1
today , @entity106 is @entity7 's most recognized international brand			1
world famous according to the @entity109 , in 2012 @entity7 exported 340 million kilograms of tea , the third highest by volume behind @entity112 and @entity10 , though number two when measured in value terms , thanks to the premium revolution begun by @entity106 's founder			1
when asked about the future of @entity7 tea given increased competition from younger , more productive fields in @entity112 and the global coffee craze , @entity85 's son , @entity106 executive @entity122 , points to his competition			1
" we need @entity127 and others to continue introducing sophisticated products that identify @entity3 tea as the finest grown to the next generations , " he says			0
for his part , @entity134 founder @entity133 saw a market niche five years ago			0
" @entity3 tea had not changed much since my grandparent 's time , " explains the 22 year - old @entity138 native			0
" when our 26 - year civil war ended in 2009 , we all knew a tourist boom would come			0
