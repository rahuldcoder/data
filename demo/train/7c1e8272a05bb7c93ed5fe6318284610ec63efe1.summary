-- as events continue to unfold in @entity5 , the future of this @entity3 nation remains unknown			1
will the regime of president @entity9 eventually fall ? if so , what kind of leadership would replace @entity9 ? if not , would @entity9 's style of governance change ? the answers will have a major impact on @entity5 's neighbors and the @entity17			1
it 's a complicated web of affairs , laced with deep historical , political and religious ties			0
there are several factors to consider : @entity5 's relationships with @entity24 and @entity25 ; its presence in neighboring @entity27 , a country struggling to maintain a delicate balance among its religious and ethnic sects ; and the roles of @entity31 like @entity32 and @entity33			1
we asked four people to share their thoughts on the connection between @entity5 and the current state of affairs in the region , posing the question : " what kind of impact do the events in @entity5 have on the rest of the @entity17 ? " @entity45 : @entity46 could draw in other countries @entity45 teaches foreign policy at @entity49 in @entity50			1
a former @entity53 official who worked on @entity17 issues , she held various roles with the @entity56 , the @entity57 and the @entity58 to the @entity59			1
she is also co-author of the blog @entity61			0
the civil war in @entity5 is likely to prove a watershed for the @entity17 's balance of power			1
it has the potential to become a full - blown regional war that could spill over into other countries and bring those countries into conflict , through proxies and perhaps even directly			1
on top of that , the temptation to arm and fund @entity5 rebels could spark a great power confrontation over @entity5			1
@entity77 and @entity78 have made it clear that that they oppose foreign military intervention in @entity5 , especially by the @entity82			1
and in @entity77 's case , it has made it clear that it will protect @entity5 , its beachhead in the @entity87			1
@entity77 has a longtime relationship with the country , and it has drawn a red line against @entity82 intervention			1
@entity77 has sent naval assets , weapons and radar to @entity5 , and it could even send @entity77 personnel to protect it			1
@entity77 and @entity78 's approach to the @entity5 conflict is very different from the posture they took toward the @entity82 invasion of @entity102 and @entity104 military intervention in @entity105			1
if you watch the @entity104 or @entity31 states ' media , you would have the impression that everyone in @entity5 opposes and is fighting the government			1
in @entity5 , a significant portion of the population is disaffected , but the majority still supports the regime			1
a series of public polls , for example , show that the @entity9 government still retains a majority of the support of the population			0
the reason ? the basic majority , about 55 % of the population , is terrified at the prospect of the other 45 % forming a @entity129 tyranny over the country			0
the 55 % have held together -- as they have for decades -- to essentially hold @entity5 together as an independent , secular political order			1
there are now several countries , principally @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity136 , @entity137 and the @entity82 , that have aligned themselves with the angry minority			1
the strategic problem for these countries is that even if rebels are militarily successful and force @entity9 from power , the new government would be one that roughly 55 % of the population does not want and / or fears			1
this means that without a negotiated way forward , we know that the outcome of arming or supporting the rebels means -- at a minimum -- only sustained violence and instability in @entity5 and for the region			1
@entity156 : ' @entity158 ' between @entity159 , sunnis @entity156 is the @entity160 fellow at the @entity161			0
he is also the author of " in the @entity162 : an eyewitness account of @entity50 's @entity164 with @entity5			2
" the events in @entity5 impact the general struggle between @entity24 and the @entity129 - @entity3 alliance in the region			2
the minority @entity171 - dominated regime in @entity5 is backed by @entity24 , and the majority of @entity5 are @entity173			1
there is sort of a cold war taking place between the two sides			0
i think you can see that playing out in terms of @entity33 , the @entity183 , @entity32 and @entity136 clearly on the side of the opposition in @entity5 , while the @entity24 are strongly backing the regime			1
what 's at stake is larger than what 's within @entity5 's borders			2
@entity5 is a keystone of the @entity24 alliance			2
it allows @entity24 to protect its power on the shores of the @entity87 and its border with @entity196 , particularly its support of @entity25 in @entity27			0
and the more this violence continues , especially with the regime using brutal force , the more it enrages people in the @entity173 countries			2
although other governments have been holding back in their support of the opposition until recently , there are many individuals in the region who will help sponsor the opposition within @entity5			2
a lot of this is about the future of the @entity173 world and what the basis of these governments will be			0
for so long , it has been based on narrow regimes and , in the case of @entity5 , a narrow minority regime			1
whatever comes next is likely to be a majoritarian system that has a larger base			0
@entity220 : interference would change the dynamics @entity220 is the director of @entity17 studies at @entity224			1
he is also the homepage editor of @entity225 , an independent online @entity3 affairs magazine produced by the @entity227			0
@entity220 wrote " @entity228 in @entity5 : the political economy of @entity230			2
" the @entity5 situation is complex like any other uprising , but the situation has added complexity because it is at the juncture of several conflicts in the region			2
those struggles involve local , regional and international power plays that make the situation a lot more charged			2
for instance , we have @entity5 at the center of the @entity3 - @entity196 conflict			2
@entity5 is part of an axis , so to speak , with @entity24 and @entity25 , confronting imperialism in various forms from inside and outside the region , particularly in relation to @entity82 domination and @entity196 's occupations and belligerence			1
there is also resistance to the conservative @entity3 camp that includes @entity32 , @entity33 and other conservative countries that are usually allies with the @entity82			1
also , @entity5 is , in many ways , the guarantor of stability in @entity27			2
@entity5 's presence in @entity27 has guaranteed some stability despite many violations of @entity27 's sovereignty by @entity5			2
for all these reasons , @entity5 's position in the region is pivotal			2
this is not simply another uprising against a dictator			0
it is also being transformed by other players into an effort to redraw the political map of the region and curtail further protests elsewhere			0
a lot of the anti-regime actors and analysts are placed in an odd position			0
they do not support the regime or the turn that the uprising has taken since fall of last year			0
so perhaps the task is to build an independent opposition away from the dictates of @entity32 , @entity33 or the @entity82			2
military intervention in @entity5 will bring in @entity24 and @entity25 , and that will change the dynamic of the conflict			1
most people in the region are opposed to the @entity5 regime 's domestic behavior during the past decades , but they are not opposed to its regional role			1
the problem is the @entity5 regime 's internal repression , not its external policies			1
if there is no interference from the outside , the uprisings will be seen as legitimate			0
if it becomes regional and you bring in the @entity82 and @entity196 in a fight against the @entity5 regime , it changes the strategic dynamics of the conflict -- and not just the players involved			1
@entity312 : democracy takes time @entity312 is the director of the @entity316 's @entity315 for the @entity17 in @entity50			2
previously , she was a @entity17 affairs specialist at the @entity56 and the @entity53			2
she also served as a diplomat in @entity318 and @entity319			0
when i travel to the @entity17 , it is striking how in the eastern part of the @entity173 world , sectarian issues are right on the surface of public discourse and shape the way people look at the uprisings			1
for example , the same person might support the uprising in @entity5 but not the one in @entity333 , or vice versa , depending on whether that person is @entity129 or @entity159			0
there are many reasons for this , including the rise of @entity24 and the unleashing of sectarian sentiments in @entity102 after @entity341 was deposed			0
sectarian feeling is less pronounced in the western part of the @entity173 world , which is largely populated by @entity173			0
last summer , @entity32 and the other @entity31 abandoned @entity9 and withdrew their ambassadors from @entity5			0
perhaps they did this partly because they saw how strong the popular uprising in @entity5 was and assessed that @entity9 might not be able to outlast it			0
perhaps they also saw a chance of getting a @entity129 majority government into power in @entity5 , which would make the @entity31 more comfortable			1
probably , their desire to change the regional sectarian and political power balance has largely dictated their policies toward @entity5			1
certainly , @entity5 has been a key cog in the machine of @entity24 's influence in the @entity362			0
@entity5 has provided the avenue through which @entity24 could project political influence into @entity27 and @entity365 through @entity25 and @entity366			0
the @entity366 link with @entity5 has already been broken			0
@entity366 has turned against @entity9 , partly out of support for the @entity369 and partly because @entity370 is no longer a safe haven for them			0
@entity366 is now working on closer relations with @entity373 , where the @entity369 controls close to half of the parliament , is running a candidate for president and is likely to have a strong presence in the new @entity379			0
we are not going to see in any of the @entity3 countries a neat transition to a democracy in a year or two			0
countries do not make that shift -- from authoritarianism to democracy -- so rapidly			0
achieving a well - functioning democracy could happen in perhaps 10 to 15 years			0
there will be setbacks , bloodshed and disappointments along the way			0
but we have to stay with this for a while , develop sustainable strategies to help these countries , and not abandon them a year or two into their transitions			0
the opportunity to establish functioning democracies in the @entity173 world is a tremendous and historic one for the @entity17 , and the risks if these transitions fail -- with all that could bring in terms of instability , safe havens for terrorists , etc. -- are also enormous			0
the opinions expressed in this article are solely those of the authors .			0

whatever happens in @entity5 will have a major effect on its neighbors and the @entity17
expert : a regional war could draw in outside countries such as the @entity82 , @entity77
the sectarian power balance might change if the @entity5 regime is deposed
