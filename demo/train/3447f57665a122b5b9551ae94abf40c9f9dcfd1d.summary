-- admit it : you 've gone to the grocery store in your pjs			2
maybe you just needed half and half for your morning coffee or went out after a day of marathoning whole seasons of " @entity9			0
" maybe you really like how your pajamas feel and aspire to wear them @entity12 - style , which is to say , as often as possible			1
but deep inside your soul -- in the place that determines the difference between right and wrong -- @entity18 believes you know it 's taboo			1
" it 's a universal fashion affront tied into social appropriateness , " the " @entity22 " style maven said of loose , knit ensembles			1
he 's witnessed nothing less than a paradigm shift in @entity29 ' concept of appropriate clothing over the past 10 years on " @entity22 , " as he helped 600 fashion victims learn to put their best face ( and well - dressed - self ) forward			1
but the allure of pajamas , yoga pants and track suits is strong			1
" we are continuing , as a culture , on this downward spiral of style , " @entity18 said , " i think that there will always be a group of people , a strong percentage of the population , who will care about their appearance			1
but now we have permission not to care			0
" what changed ? he said it 's that people no longer face the same social pressures they would have centuries ago , or even a couple decades ago			1
that social pressure , the unwritten rules about how someone should or should not dress , has always existed , said @entity58 , a @entity60 , professor in textiles and clothing , and women and gender studies			0
" clothing has been described as a broadcast signal , the way it communicates , " @entity65 said			0
" we know ( an appropriate outfit ) when we see it			0
when something does n't look quite right , then we notice that			0
" that knowledge is called a social norm , she said , and the norms surrounding fashion incorporate the function of clothing as well as the cultural attitudes of the day			1
" we 're a pretty @entity82 kind of country , " @entity65 said			0
" that has influenced our clothing a lot			0
" as a result , @entity29 social norms have always boiled down to modesty , she said			0
colonists hardly showed any skin or even hair in public , an aspect of @entity29 dress that did n't change much until the 1900s			1
the notion of privacy has been intertwined with ideas of modesty since colonial days as well , said @entity102 , the curator of the @entity103 in @entity104 , @entity105			0
while performing chores around the house or going to the market , " ( colonists ) definitely would not have been wearing clothing that would have been considered private , " @entity102 said			1
" they would have been wearing all the proper layers of clothing			1
" in colonial times , that meant women would wear a chemise , a corset , a corset cover , a bodice , multiple layers of petticoats and then a dress , @entity102 explained			1
" and you would have been wearing that regardless of whether you saw someone else or not , " she said			0
" it just would n't have been appropriate otherwise			0
" the line between public and private clothing started to blur with the advent of the " indoor wrapper " during @entity132 times , @entity102 said			1
" these were considered appropriate for a woman to wear to receive a woman friend at her house			1
they still were proper , they were just a little less restrictive , " she said			0
barely more formal than a robe , this precursor to the housecoat allowed women the opportunity to be in a semipublic situation without having to wear all the bustles and petticoats that public dress usually required			1
men had their own version of wrappers as well , she said			0
still , it 's a far cry from the pajama - clad parents @entity102 sees dropping children off at school			2
that boundary of public and private dress has moved from the house into the neighborhood , @entity18 said			1
we no longer seek clues about appropriate dress from our community			0
these days , we look to celebrities , he said			0
" i think that one photograph of one celebrity wearing something ( inappropriate ) can validate someone , " he said			0
" and they will leave the house wearing the same thing			0
" before @entity172 was photographed wearing @entity174 boots , no one would have considered wearing them in public , he said			2
the cult of comfort is not only determined by stylish starlets , said @entity65 , the textiles professor			0
clothing experienced a revolution in the 1960s , thanks to textiles such as polyester , rayon and spandex , as well as mass production technology			2
" @entity190 , the famous designer in the ' 60s known for designing the one - piece topless bathing suit , was also known for doing a lot of knits , " she said			1
" he predicted that we would all be wearing , like , knit dancewear by now			2
and i think he 's kind of right			2
" we 've become accustomed to a kind of comfort level in knits			0
" but the devil is in that forgiving detail of stretch , @entity18 said			1
" it 's very easy in this country to do two things , " he said			2
two : wear really comfortable clothes			1
the problem is , when you combine both of those things you get caught in a spiral			2
" large portions of cheap , overly processed foods keep us wearing stretchy , knit clothes -- that makes it easier to eat more large , overprocessed portions			1
" i 've heard this from women time after time : ' before you know it , you 've gained 30 pounds			0
' and then you get to a point where it 's hopeless -- ' i ca n't lose 30 pounds			2
' " what 's next ? " you say , ' uh , i give up , ' " he said			2
" ' i 'll keep wearing my big comfy pants			0
' " would you wear pajamas or other ultracasual clothes outside the house ? tell us why or why not in the comments , on @entity233 or on @entity235 's facebook page .			1

today , it 's socially *acceptable* to wear pajamas in public , if not always appropriate
for centuries , people dressed in formal layers , even for daily chores
1960s fashion designer @entity190 predicted we would wear stretchy clothes
@entity18 of " @entity22 " : " we are continuing *...* on this downward spiral of style "
