@entity0 , @entity1 -- nineteen - year - old @entity3 sits on the stairs outside her parents ' home , staring at the tiny screen on her cell phone			1
the video on the screen has her mesmerized : a very short home video of her baby girl , @entity11			1
the moments captured are precious because they show @entity3 's only child alive and well			2
@entity11 died in the hospital			0
she was three months old			0
authorities say the baby was admitted to the hospital with bite marks , cigarette burns and a dislocated neck			2
police say she was killed by her father			0
" after my delivery my husband had come to see me and the baby			2
he said , ' it is a girl , why did you give birth to a girl ? ' " he wanted a boy , an heir			1
girls were too expensive , he said			2
a couple of days after giving birth , @entity3 says her husband gave an ultimatum			0
" for her wedding we will require a hundred thousand rupees ( about us $ 1,800 dollars ) for all the expense			0
if you can get that amount from your mother , then keep her , but if you ca n't , then kill her , " @entity3 recalled her husband as saying			0
she did n't believe he meant it and was sure he would change his mind once he held his soft , bright - eyed baby girl			1
three months later , her baby is dead , and her husband is under arrest , accused of beating the baby to death			1
police say he confessed to the killing			2
this is by no means the first case of its kind in @entity1			1
attitudes , traditions , and economics have come together to make being a girl a dangerous prospect in the country , doctors say			1
most of the time girls are disposed of long before they are born			2
how ? sex - selective abortions			2
@entity64 @entity63 rejects abortion ban based on sex of fetus @entity1 has a growing gender gap : the 2011 census showed that for every 1,000 boys six years or younger there were only 914 girls			1
it is the lowest child sex ratio since @entity1 's independence in 1947			1
the @entity75 has said @entity1 is the most dangerous place to be a girl			1
dr. @entity78 at @entity79 ( @entity80 ) , who has studied the gender gap for years , agrees			2
" yes , largely this is from the point of view of mortality statistics for girls versus boys , " @entity78 told @entity2			1
sex - selective abortions are against the law in @entity1 but are still happening at an alarming rate , he said			1
his study shows a surprising trend : sex selective abortions among the educated and well - off seem to be more prevalent than among the desperately poor and uneducated			2
despite greater prosperity , their mindsets have not changed and they have the money to pay for ultrasounds and abortions			0
" a boy is seen as a better investment			0
they prefer boys , " @entity78 said			2
the explanation goes something like this : in traditional @entity1 families the men marry and bring their bride home to live and take care of his parents			1
girls , on the other hand , marry and leave the home without providing extra financial support			0
moreover , a girl 's family can go broke trying to pay a dowry to get her married			1
although outlawed in @entity1 , dowries are still common and take different forms throughout society			1
@entity1 law also forbids doctors to tell a couple the sex of their child after an ultrasound , but many clinics break the law and do so anyway			1
@entity1 has made an effort across the country to stop female infanticide			1
@entity2 visited a village in @entity138 state with one of the worst ratios of boys to girls , according to the @entity1 government			1
a campaign is under way to change villagers ' minds about girls			0
tiny placards above the doors of several homes say in @entity152 : " if you get rid of your girls , where will you find your daughter - in - laws ? " a teenage boy wore a t - shirt that said , " save our girls			1
" nonetheless , there were young boys everywhere and only a few young girls			1
villagers only affirmed why there appeared to be an imbalance			0
" girls are mostly aborted here			0
the people want more boys			0
there is a shortage of girls , " @entity170 said without hesitation			0
the villager was taking care of her neighbor 's newborn baby girl			1
she cooed at the baby while blowing cigarette smoke into its tiny little face , oblivious to the dangers second - hand smoke could pose			2
she told us the poorest people do n't have the money to abort , so they are forced to keep girls , but those who can afford an ultrasound and abortion get rid of female fetuses			1
" so much money is required to get them married			0
where will the money come from ? " she said			0
" everything is so expensive these days			0
" but @entity1 is a country filled with in - your - face contradictions			1
when it comes to women and girls it is a place where the discarding of girls is juxtaposed with the fact that @entity1 has a female president and speaker of the house -- and its most powerful politician is a woman , @entity206			1
@entity207 , @entity206 's mother - in - law , became @entity1 's first woman prime minister and one of the world 's first female heads of government			1
in 2011 the latest census data showed the literacy rate for girls is growing faster than for boys			2
@entity3 , whose husband is accused of killing their baby , and her parents say they always believed a baby -- boy or girl -- was a blessing			1
her mother , @entity225 , had four girls and a boy			0
though the family is poor , she raised her girls with great hope for their futures			0
" with all that is there in my heart , my heart breaks every time i recall what happened [ to my granddaughter ]			0
even when i was starving i raised my children , all four of them			0
i used to pray to @entity240 to save me from seeing any of my children die before my own eyes			0
my children should succeed in life			0
they should make us proud , " she said			0
@entity3 now lives with her parents in a tiny two - room home filled to a bursting point with family members			0
she will spend her life struggling with the fact that she never got the chance to raise her first child because the baby was born a girl			2
with tears welling in her eyes , @entity3 said , " she had just come into the world			0
she was like a flower bud , and he killed her			0
what can be worse than this ? " is tide turning against killing of infants in @entity267 ? @entity2 's @entity268 contributed to this report .			2

@entity1 man is accused of killing 3 - month - old baby girl because he wanted a son
the @entity75 says @entity1 is the most dangerous place to be a girl
it 's common to abort female babies because boys are seen as ' better investments '
for every 1,000 boys 6 years and under , there are 914 girls -- the lowest ratio since 1947
