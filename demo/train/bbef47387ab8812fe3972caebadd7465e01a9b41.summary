-- as @entity3 gov. @entity2 fights back against the biggest political controversy of his career , he 's under fire , as expected , from opportunistic attacks from the left			2
@entity9 : three reasons bridge scandal will stick @entity12 : @entity2 apology hits all the right notes but there are plenty within his own party who may also be pleased to see the tough - talking @entity20 governor get a bit of a comeuppance			1
the party 's conservative base has never warmed to @entity2			1
and he angered other @entity20 with his 2012 @entity27 speech that was more about him than the party 's nominee @entity28			1
and some will never forgive him for his public embrace of president @entity31 who was surveying damage in @entity3 from @entity33 just days before the presidential election			1
archives : @entity2 , @entity31 set to meet again on @entity36 @entity2 took the first steps thursday toward rehabilitation -- apologizing profusely and announcing that he had fired two close aides connected the closing of access lanes to the @entity43 -- the nation 's busiest -- to punish the mayor of @entity46 , @entity3 , for not endorsing him in his re-election bid last year			1
the lane closings caused massive traffic jams in @entity46			0
@entity2 drops swagger amid heat of scandal with scandal , @entity2 loses his top enforcer following thursday 's news conference , a top national tea party leader questioned whether @entity2 had put the controversy behind him			1
" governor @entity2 held some subordinates accountable			0
time will tell whether this is enough , " wrote @entity61 , co-founder and national coordinator for the @entity63			0
@entity65 , who heads the @entity65 , went a step further			0
" this incident is proof that once again the most dangerous place on the earth is the spot between @entity2 and his presidential ambitions , " @entity65 told @entity0			0
" i strongly suspect there will be litigation as a result of this and the beauty of litigation is the truth will come out			0
i strongly suspect there is much more to this than what @entity2 let on in his news conference			0
" grassroots conservatives are skeptical of @entity2 because of his praise for @entity31 over the federal government 's assistance to @entity3 for @entity33 damage , and because of his criticism of some congressional @entity20 over their initial reluctance to support federal relief aid to @entity3 following @entity33			1
@entity2 has also angered conservatives with his willingness to work with @entity93 on such issues as immigration reform , and his criticism of some on the right , including sen. @entity99 of @entity100 , a tea party favorite who 's a possible rival for the 2016 @entity20 nomination			1
@entity2 heralds @entity103 as message to @entity105 will @entity2 's immigration bill haunt him in 2016 ? thursday , following the @entity2 news conference , @entity99 seemed to take a dig at @entity2 , saying , " i do n't know who e-mailed whom , who works for whom			1
i have been in traffic before and i know how angry i am , and i 'm always wondering , who did this			0
" @entity115 , co-founder of @entity116 and leading voice on the right , wrote wednesday in an article titled " @entity120 " that " there 's more here and it is going to be the problem that haunts @entity2			2
" and @entity125 's @entity124 , who 's also influential among conservatives , tweeted wednesday that " @entity2 is not a conservative			1
do n't delude yourself into thinking he is			0
" but the conservatives could n't resist an opportunity to get in a dig at their real nemesis			0
" the contrast between @entity31 and @entity2 in terms of owning a mess and fixing it is now pretty stark , " tweeted @entity115			2
" this could end being a positive for @entity2 though			0
they 're not getting that with @entity31 , " wrote @entity124 on @entity140			0
@entity61 made the same point in her statement , writing , " we 're still waiting for president @entity31 to hold anyone accountable			1
" @entity2 's re-election team actively sought out the endorsements of @entity93 officials , such as @entity46 's mayor , in its push to win a major gubernatorial victory as a prelude or launching pad to any 2016 @entity155 bid			1
they succeeded , as @entity2 won in a landslide over little known state sen. @entity158			2
but the current controversy , born during that re-election drive , gives opponents an opportunity to spin @entity2 persona of a tough - talking politician into one of a political bully who 's not above petty politics			2
" this is the other side of the double - edged sword that is @entity2 's heavy - handed persona and governing style			1
at one level there 's an appeal about it , but underneath it you sense it could blow up , " @entity20 communications strategist @entity174 told @entity0			2
" the boss sets the tone for those around him and beneath him			0
i do n't think this is the last story we 're going to see about problems with @entity2 's governing style , and even @entity20 establishment power brokers and money people will be concerned about how this plays in the 2016 primaries and caucuses -- where the @entity20 field will be more substantive than it was in 2012 , " added @entity174 , a senior vice president at @entity182 , a @entity105 public relations firm that has had many conservative and @entity20 clients			1
while there 's concern , there does n't seem to be a groundswell of conservative criticism right now			0
" i do not believe there 's going to be any retribution from conservatives over this , " @entity199 , a @entity20 strategist and a longtime senior political adviser to former @entity20 sen. @entity201 , a 2012 presidential candidate , told @entity0			1
" i have n't heard a single person tell me that the news is great because it 's going to hurt @entity2			2
i do n't think there will be a piling on by conservatives			0
" @entity2 , who 's now criss - crossing the country , campaigning for fellow @entity20 governors as chairman of the @entity213 , is seen as prime target of @entity93 , especially since three national polls , starting with a @entity0 / @entity217 survey in november , showed @entity2 as the early frontrunner among possible 2016 @entity20 contenders			1
and national and state @entity93 have been relentless the past two months in highlighting the @entity43 controversy			0
but the bigger concern for @entity2 going forward is not @entity93 , but opponents in his own party .			2

the @entity20 's conservative base has never warmed to @entity2
@entity2 's public embrace of president @entity31 in 2012 hurt him with *republicans*
@entity20 sen. @entity99 , a tea party favorite seemed to take a dig at @entity2
but a @entity20 strategist says : " i do not believe there 's going to be any retribution from conservatives over this "
