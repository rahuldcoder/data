-- attention passengers : @entity2 is cracking down on travelers with oversized carry - on luggage			1
the airline says it is motivated not by money -- the airline charges $ 25 for checked luggage -- but by complaints that some passengers are hogging space in the overhead bins			1
to address those gripes , @entity2 recently e-mailed frequent fliers reminding them of the size restrictions for carry - ons			1
and employees were told to keep an eye out for large carry - on bags			2
" this is solely about ensuring the greatest number of customers with standard - sized carry - ons are able to store them onboard , " a spokesman said			0
the airline stressed it is not changing its policy but is trying to more strictly enforce it			1
if your bag does n't fit in the bag measure at the security line , be prepared to be directed back to the ticket counter to check the bag for a $ 25 bag fee			2
passengers who get through the security checkpoint with an oversized bag will not be sent back to the ticket counter , a spokesman said			0
instead , the bag will be gate - checked for free			0
even if your large carry - on could technically be squeezed into the bin , @entity2 said it takes away space from other customers if it 's not within the size restrictions ( 9 x 14 x 22 inches , including handles and wheels			1
) the airline retrofitted 152 airbus planes with larger bins			0
they say their newer planes acquired in the past 10 years also have larger bins			0
oversized carry - ons is a frequent problem on domestic flights and less so on international flights , since most international fliers headed to a destination for a longer period usually check luggage			2
how to avoid baggage fees : wear your luggage a tale of lost luggage and faith in government restored @entity67 loosens rules on international alcohol what do you think ? are you a bin hog ? how should airlines manage bin space ?			0

@entity2 says it will more strictly enforce its carry - on policy
the airline said the move was prompted by complaints about bin hogging
the policy has n't changed but more oversized bags may *end* up checked for $ 25
