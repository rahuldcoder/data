-- the charm of @entity2 is apparent the moment you spot it from the boat transporting you to its shores			1
sitting there like a lonely sponge cake protruding from the surface of a clear blue plate , the island 's sheer size -- or lack thereof -- promises something not only special but personal			1
@entity2 lies in the @entity15 just west of the mainland region of @entity17			1
arriving on this tiny island off the west coast of @entity20 , you enter the port built into the side of the volcanic island by the ancient @entity24 and only recently developed and expanded to provide for heavier traffic			1
the fishermen 's boats lining the harbor along with pizza and scuba shops give the island that quintessential small - town @entity20 feel			1
to get to the center of the island , you walk the winding ramp to @entity37 , where the town hall sits			0
grab a cappuccino at one of the two cafes there , which moonlight as restaurants during peak season from may to october			0
if caffeine does n't satisfy you , grab a bottle of wine at one of the local alimentari and sit in the park right off the square for majestic views of the small uninhabited island of @entity54 ( used to detain @entity56 's adversaries during his rule )			2
part of the cluster of islands known as the @entity61 , @entity2 -- which gets its name from the @entity20 word for wind , " vento " -- lies in the @entity15 just west of the mainland region of @entity17			1
it occupies less than a square mile , and its history dates to the @entity68 , when emperors such as @entity70 and @entity71 found the island 's isolation perfect for banished troublemakers			1
during @entity76 , it was used as a listening post by a @entity79 garrison before being captured by the @entity80 in 1943			0
the island also has a rich literary history			0
it is thought that @entity84 intended this to be the spot where @entity86 confronted the sirens during his long journey home			0
@entity90 wrote about the 1943 @entity92 raid on @entity2 while he was a war correspondent for the @entity93			2
during the day , you can sunbathe at one of the three main beaches			0
@entity97 is the preferred choice for its accessibility , black volcanic sand and rock outcroppings that make for ideal basking in the intense @entity104 sun. @entity2 has become a scuba diving destination because of its lush and mostly undisturbed aquatic life			1
there are several scuba - diving schools on the island , one of which was erected in the late ' 70s and is the oldest scuba academy in the whole of @entity20			1
private and group lessons start at 100 euros			0
@entity2 's size makes it perfect for simply setting off and exploring			1
walking is cheap , and traversing the bright landscape -- which often doubles as cliff 's edge because of the island 's narrow width -- is rewarding not only for its brilliantly colored vegetation but also for its panoramic views and lack of entry fee			1
lower on the island , discover the chiseled rocks pockmarked by saline ( little crevices used to collect fresh salt water in ancient times ) and the sea caves down by the port where transparent pools often act as windows into the astonishing marine life that surrounds the island			2
if you 're looking for something a little less nature - oriented , there are two museums			0
@entity145 -- which is less enclosed museum than outdoor relic -- is the ancient remains of a structure that housed / imprisoned emperor @entity70 ' daughter , @entity150 , who was exiled there for her promiscuity and immorality			0
the other is the @entity155 , which in its more standard presentation holds many artifacts that have been uncovered on the island over the years			0
unlike its more frantic ( by @entity20 standards ) and popular southern neighbors , @entity162 and @entity163 , @entity2 has barely been touched by international tourism			1
the hotels are affordable , and the food is n't overpriced			0
today , it 's home to a year - round population of about 600			0
that number skyrockets during the summer months , especially in august , when it seems that every @entity20 heads to the seaside , or september , when the @entity173 ( @entity174 ) turns the island into one extended party			2
@entity2 's real appeal is n't in its breathtaking 360 - degree sea views , its clear , clean water or even its architecture and people			2
there are other places in @entity20 just as stunning			2
its charm is in the sense you get that you 're experiencing something not discovered by the tourists who flock en masse to the rest of @entity20 year - round			2
a sense you 're among @entity20 .			0
