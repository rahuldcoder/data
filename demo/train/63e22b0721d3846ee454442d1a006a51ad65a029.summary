for @entity1 , life was good			1
she and her boyfriend , @entity4 , were in love and along with her young son @entity7 , they were excited to become a family			2
the only distraction was her aching knee , which began bothering her in spring 2012			1
@entity1 described the " multiple trips " to the doctor 's office			1
" the first appointment was like , ' i think there 's something wrong with my knee			1
it 's achy sometimes but then it goes away			2
' " the doctor told her it was probably just arthritis or bursitis			2
then she went back a couple of months later and was told it 's " something you 're going to have to live with			2
" this went on for over a year until finally @entity1 , who lives in @entity26 , @entity27 , could not walk anymore and was referred to a specialist in october 2013			1
but before she made it to the specialist , the pain became so intense she had to go to the hospital			2
" i had excruciating pain in my knee and my toes went numb			1
so i went to the hospital and they did an x-ray , " she said			2
they had just wheeled @entity39 back to the waiting room to wait for the results when they rushed her back into a room and said the doctor needed to speak with her			2
the doctor came in and said , " you have bone cancer			1
" a cancer known as osteosarcoma			1
she was just 24 years old and in shock from the news			2
@entity1 could n't believe what she was hearing , " i was like , no. ' @entity53 who thinks of when their knee hurts that they have bone cancer ? " @entity1 still gets emotional when she talks about how long it took to get her eventual diagnosis			1
" i 'm angry , " @entity1 said , tears welling in her eyes , " but there 's really nothing we can do about it now			1
the doctor that i went to repeatedly and repeatedly telling him something was n't right probably cost me my life			2
this is a very aggressive cancer			1
i could have had more time			2
" @entity1 underwent surgery to replace her knee and remove the majority of her femur			1
the doctors also said she should start chemotherapy immediately , but there was a very big risk			1
@entity1 was already 10 weeks pregnant with a baby girl			1
" they told me what would likely happen to @entity80 , that you know , she most likely would n't make it and i just knew			2
it was n't a choice to me			2
it was like this is what needs to be done			0
i 'm not going to kill a healthy baby because i 'm sick			0
there 's nothing wrong with her			0
her life is just as important as mine if not more important			0
i mean as a mother my job is to protect my kids			0
" unwavering in her decision to delay treatment -- a choice that could ultimately cost her life -- she knew @entity4 and her mother would support her no matter what			0
@entity1 ' mother , @entity104 , said her daughter has always been strong - willed and this decision did n't surprise her			1
" i always tell her it 's not over ' til it 's over , " she said			0
we might get that miracle " but after giving birth to @entity80 in july , a full body scan revealed the cancer had spread throughout @entity1 ' body , even into her brain			1
" when they told me that , i think oh my gosh , i am really dying			0
i 'm not going to beat this			0
and then i am sad for about a week and then i get back to ok , well it 's not over yet			0
and then i 'll be good and then i 'll get some more bad news that it spread through my whole entire body			1
and then that will knock me down for about a week and then i 'll bounce back			0
" but @entity1 admits it 's hard to be in pain all the time			1
@entity1 ' doctors say she has months to live , but she still has goals			1
" i am really pushing for @entity80 's first birthday			0
this is what i do			0
i do october , ok , i just got to make it to @entity134			0
@entity134 comes around -- ok , let 's just go to @entity136			0
then @entity136 comes and @entity7 's birthday is in march , so i 'm going to make it to @entity7 's birthday			0
i 'm just going to keep setting little goals for myself and we 'll see			0
" 24 - year - old cancer victim inspires after death after the terminal diagnosis , @entity1 and @entity4 moved their wedding date up a couple of months to this past november			1
@entity1 brightens when she talks about her wedding day			1
@entity7 , 6 , got to walk her down the aisle			0
" it just went by so fast			0
if i could sum that day up it would just be magical			0
loved seeing all my friends , my family all together			0
" @entity157 - @entity156 , owner of @entity159 and @entity160 , planned the wedding in just a few weeks and has become a source of support for @entity1 and her family			1
she also has photographed @entity1 ' recent milestones -- from her pregnancy and the newborn to her engagement and holiday pictures -- documenting many of life 's firsts			1
@entity156 , a mother of three , sees @entity1 as the perfect example of what motherhood is all about			1
" i think that this has helped express to others who have never had children the depth of actually a mom 's love -- the selflessness			0
it 's just like the best example that she has shown the entire world			0
so for that , she is definitely one of the most bravest people that i 've ever met			0
" for @entity1 , the memories and photographs are invaluable			1
my kids are going to have these memories			0
my husband 's going to have these			0
and my kids are going to be able to look at these forever			0
" when asked about what her legacy might be , @entity1 softly breaks down and says , " i want my kids to know how much i love them and how much i fought for them			1
" when the cancer you beat comes back @entity2 's @entity200 contributed to this report .			2
