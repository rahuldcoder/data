-- with 2013 firmly in the rearview mirror , the movers and shakers of the video gaming industry are focusing on where the next 12 months will take us			1
with new platforms and consoles available and more people playing games on smartphones and tablets , the future appears to be open to a vast array of possibilities			2
we asked four industry players what they think the next year will look like			1
each offered a few specifics and a broader view about what will be important to game makers and players			0
many expect 2013 's releases of new hardware and software platforms -- most notably , the @entity29 and @entity30 consoles -- to spur creativity in game development and delivery			1
here 's what they told us : @entity36 , creative director , @entity37 " 2013 was the year of the left field : crowdfunding , the steam box , in - house streaming			1
2014 is the year we 're going to start to see how that changes the space			1
the majority of old - school developers i know now have gone into more personal , niche titles ; ( it ) reminds me of when many of the great pc studios ( @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 ) started developing console games in the early 2000s			2
" being in gaming is like being in music in the ' 60s , but there 's a new @entity57 invasion like every three years			2
i think disruption is generally a good thing			0
it keeps us on our toes as developers and usually yields dividends for gamers			0
" @entity66 , managing director , @entity68 " we 've seen the mobile industry consistently evolve over the past five years and , in my opinion , 2014 will be no exception			1
i anticipate the trends in 2013 -- increased time spent playing games on mobile devices and a shift to ' freemium ' pricing in games -- will continue to grow in 2014			2
" with more than 2 billion smart devices currently activated and the increased availability of low - end smart devices , the mobile market has never been stronger or reached such a mass audience			2
gaming has expanded to represent around a third of time spent on connected devices , and i am confident gaming will confirm its position as one of the core uses on those devices in 2014			1
" additionally , as app quality as a whole continues to improve , we will see fewer applications , but with more budget and ambition put behind them			0
the last important trend i believe we will see is the extension of ' freemium ' mobile games to new devices such as smartwatches and smart @entity105			0
" @entity106 , host , @entity107 " 2014 will be a monumental year for the gaming industry			1
both the @entity30 and @entity29 will continue to grow their install base , and we will begin to see more games built specifically to take advantage of the next generation hardware			2
already fans are anticipating the birth of new franchises like ' @entity117 ' and ' @entity118			0
' " that said , 2014 will be a year of experimentation			1
we will see more games on tablets , new business models birthed by the rise of digital distribution , the continued growth of esports and exciting new ventures like @entity130 's steam box			0
" what used to be a race between three console manufacturers for dominance has diversified into dozens of companies carving out their own market segments			0
" @entity137 , ceo and founder , @entity139 " 2014 is going to bring a lot of new and exciting technologies to gamers			2
the big story this year is the advances that @entity145 and @entity146 are making with @entity147 ( faster processors for graphics ) that make @entity150 gaming a reality			1
next year we 'll see those @entity150 panels come down in price			0
" with exciting technologies like @entity145 's @entity156 , designed to max out the performance capabilities of your graphics card , and @entity146 's @entity160 , designed to deliver silky smooth gaming , there 's a whole lot to get excited about			0
" and then there 's the peripherals like the @entity165			1
with gaming legend @entity166 joining the company , we can be sure to see great things from them as well			0
and let 's not forget the @entity170 it 'll be interesting to see how this new entrant into the gaming market fares alongside the next generation gaming consoles			0
as always , it 's a great time to be a gamer			0
