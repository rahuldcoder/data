@entity0 , @entity1 -- for years , small groups of @entity1 dissidents have taken their demands to the streets , calling for political freedom as they get pushed around and shouted down by swarms of government supporters			1
but a recently leaked video suggests the war between the @entity13 government and its opponents has shifted to a new battlefield : the internet			1
the video shows what appears to be an official intelligence briefing , in which a lecturer talks about the dangers and possibilities of the web			1
" we are n't fighting the new technology , " he tells his audience , who are dressed in the military uniforms worn by @entity1 's @entity28 officials			2
" we simply have to get to know it and use it in our favor , but also know what the enemy is doing			0
" the 54 - minute video was posted on the video - sharing website @entity38 by someone identified only as " @entity40 " and has since appeared on dozens of blogs , many of them critical of the @entity1 government			1
@entity2 was n't able to verify the authenticity of the video			2
although it was leaked this month , the video appears to have been recorded last summer , well before the social - media - fueled uprisings in @entity49 and the @entity50			1
but for @entity53 dissident bloggers , there are plenty of parallels			0
@entity56 followed via @entity57 the upheaval in @entity59 that ultimately led to the ouster of president @entity61 and responded with her own tweets			0
" what a great lesson the @entity59 are giving us ! " she wrote			0
@entity56 has won a huge global audience with her blog " @entity70 , " which criticizes the @entity1 government and comments on daily hardships			1
" there are a lot of similarities with @entity59 , " she told @entity2 wednesday			0
" the dissatisfaction of the people , a single voice in power for so long			0
and that 's why i was so enthusiastic about what was happening there			0
" but she said there are also very important differences -- namely @entity1 's low internet penetration			1
recent figures show an estimated 1.6 million people there are internet users , out of a population of 11.2 million			2
according to the leaked video , the @entity1 government 's fear is that @entity93 - backed dissidents will use social networks like @entity57 and @entity95 to incite unrest			1
" technology in itself is n't a threat , " the lecturer says			2
" what can be a threat is the person behind the technology , in the same way it can be an opportunity for us to do something with it			0
" @entity1 has jailed @entity93 aid worker @entity107 , who was a subcontractor for @entity109			2
@entity1 officials have accused him of distributing illegal satellite equipment to dissidents to help them connect to the internet			1
the @entity115 and @entity107 ' family say he was working with @entity117 groups			0
@entity107 has been formally charged with " acts against the independence and territorial integrity of @entity1 " and could face up to 20 years in prison when his case goes to trial			2
in the leaked video , he 's called a " mercenary			1
" " it 's just like the @entity128 , " the lecturer says			2
" but this man is coming with different weapons			0
he did n't come on a boat with a gun in his hand , but it 's the same story			0
" nonetheless , @entity1 is n't turning its back on the internet			1
dozens of pro-government blogs have also appeared , many of them written by journalists who work for state - run media			0
" they have their bloggers and we have our bloggers , " the unidentified man in the video says at one point			0
" we 'll see who comes out stronger			0
" for years , the government blamed the @entity93 embargo for restricted access to the internet , but this month , it completed an undersea fiber optic cable connecting the island to @entity156			1
when that network goes online this summer , @entity1 's bandwidth will increase by 3000			2
but the question remains whether @entity1 will be allowed unlimited access to it without restrictions			1
@entity1 currently accesses the internet via expensive satellite connections			1
as a result , the government has said it can not offer internet access to the broader population , lacking the money to create the necessary infrastructure to support it			1
it has given priority to education and health workers , who often can only access a limited intranet			0
the government also provides connections at very high costs to foreign diplomats , businesses and journalists .			0

a leaked video appears to show an intelligence briefing about the internet
the lecturer says the government must use the internet to its *advantage*
only a small *percentage* of @entity1 have *unrestricted* internet access
