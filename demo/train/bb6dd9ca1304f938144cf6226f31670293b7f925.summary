-- @entity3 was in the early stages of @entity5 when he died this week , his wife says			2
@entity3 was found dead in his @entity7 home monday after what investigators suspect was a suicide by hanging			0
what is @entity5 ? parkinson 's disease is a " progressive disorder of the nervous system , " according to the @entity15 , that primarily affects a patient 's movement			1
it often starts with a small tremor in the hand or muscle stiffness and gets worse over time			0
there is no test for @entity5 's , so it is occasionally misdiagnosed			1
@entity5 's patients often have trouble walking and talking			1
symptoms include slowness of movement , a loss of balance and slurred speech			0
with parkinson 's disease , " you may have a decreased ability to perform unconscious movements , including blinking , smiling or swinging your arms when you walk , " the @entity15 says			1
the symptoms are often worse on one side of the body			0
whom does it affect ? approximately 1 million people have parkinson 's disease in the @entity45 , according to the @entity46			1
men are more likely to get it than women , and it usually affects people over 50			0
what causes @entity5 ? your body uses a chemical called dopamine to control movement , according to the @entity58			1
dopamine is produced by neurons in the brain , which begin to die with @entity5			1
with fewer live cells , a dopamine deficit occurs , causing movement issues			2
scientists do n't know what exactly causes these cells to start to deteriorate but believe it 's a combination of genes and environmental causes			0
about 15 % to 25 % of @entity5 's patients have a family member with the disease , the @entity46 says			1
in some cases , researchers have identified a single gene mutation that 's passed from generation to generation , according to the @entity78			0
" mutations in the @entity82 gene are the greatest genetic contributor to @entity5 discovered to date , " the site states			2
but in most cases , the cause is probably a combination of gene mutations			0
studies have also linked chemicals like @entity90 and @entity91 to @entity5 's , though the relationship has not been proved			1
" a simple exposure to an environmental toxin is never enough to cause @entity5 's , " the @entity46 states			2
" in fact , there is no conclusive evidence that any environmental factor , alone , can be considered a cause of the disease			0
can you treat it ? there is no cure for @entity5 , according to the @entity58 , but doctors can help patients cope with symptoms			2
a medication called levodopa is often given to patients to help their brains make more dopamine			2
it 's often prescribed with carbidopa , which helps bring the levodopa into the brain			0
the @entity117 has approved deep brain stimulation , which is also used to treat depression , to reduce symptoms in @entity5 's patients			1
electrodes are implanted into the brain and connected to a small device that emits programmed pulses to help control movement			0
other patients prefer less invasive forms of therapy like tai chi			0
a recent study done at @entity132 found that patients with @entity5 's improved after researchers transplanted tissue from fetal dopamine cells into their brains			1
patients with severe symptoms experienced 50 % fewer symptoms in the years after surgery			0
people who had been taking medication to control their @entity5 's but found that the medicine no longer worked also saw significant improvements after surgery			1
complete coverage on @entity3 @entity5 's did n't stop his space walk			2

parkinson 's disease is a progressive disorder of the nervous system
neurons die , leaving the brain with a deficit of a chemical called dopamine
approximately 1 million people in the @entity45 have @entity5 's
