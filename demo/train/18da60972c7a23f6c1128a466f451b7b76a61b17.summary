the girls strutting down the runway in the @entity2 share many features - all are long - limbed , fine - boned and have glowing complexions			2
a silent army marching to the heavy music , past the front row a-listers peering out from behind their dark glasses			2
but one girl is different : the only one with black skin in a battalion of white faces			2
@entity14 is one of the few black models lucky enough to make this year 's cut for @entity17			1
the lack of racial diversity in the fashion industry is a serious issue that needs to be tackled , according to supermodels @entity22 and @entity24 , who this month launched a campaign to raise awareness of racism in the industry			1
" the absence of people of color on the runways and photography reinforces to our young girls that they 're not beautiful enough , that they 're not acceptable enough , " said @entity24 , model and wife of @entity31 , to @entity32			1
" the diversity that we live in , the world that we live in , is not what is shown on the runway			1
that to me is the concern			2
it 's a bigger issue at large than just about runway and models			1
" @entity22 and @entity24 , in a campaign spearheaded by former model agent @entity54 , have written to the major fashion councils of @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 and @entity59 calling for an end to racism			1
the " @entity71 , " as the trio has named itself , identifies the fashion houses which " consistently use one or no models of color " in their runway shows - including @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70			1
" no matter the intention , " their letter says , " the result is racism			2
" @entity32 reached out to each of those companies for comment , but has received no response			2
casting the ' imperfect model ' at @entity17 runways getting whiter @entity22 says the situation for black models has become worse - not better - since her debut			1
" when i started modeling in ' 86 there was @entity91 , blacks , whites , @entity88 , @entity87			1
it was very diverse , " @entity22 told @entity32			1
" it 's not like that today			2
it 's heart - breaking to me that we 're in 2013 and we 're sitting here talking about this			0
but it has to be done and people need to know			0
" the numbers speak for themselves			0
at @entity105 in february , only 6 % of designs were shown on black models , according to statistics compiled by blog @entity108			1
the vast majority of runway spots ( 82.7 % ) went to white models , with a growing proportion of @entity115 girls ( 9.1 % )			1
in @entity57 , renowned model agent @entity116 , who managed @entity22 's career for 17 years , says designers here also tend towards white models for their shows			1
" i think clients have this perception that black girls do not sell products , which goes way back to the 50 's			0
i think it 's engrained in every magazine editor			0
there are more products for blonde and blue - eyed girls			0
everything is geared to that			0
" @entity116 has only 13 black models on her books , out of the 300 or so girls she manages			1
she says the bar is set much higher for black models and they have to be flawless to get booked , so she can not afford to take them on			1
" we 're more discerning about the type of black girl we take , because we know they have to be stunningly beautiful , have an incredible body			0
" " they have to be actually perfect " she says , whereas white girls , can be more quirky - looking			0
race and fashion : still an issue ? token diversity back at the @entity2 , @entity14 is walking for @entity151 as one of only three non-white models in the cast			1
she feels lucky to get work , but says it 's harder for black models compared to their white peers			1
" when i come to a show the hairdressers are not really ready for a black girl , for black hair			0
the makeup artists , they do n't know how to do black skin			0
i can feel it sometimes - to be a black girl it 's a bit tougher than for a white girl or a @entity173 girl			0
" @entity14 says she sometimes feels like the token black girl in a show			0
" i would love to be booked for shows ... because i am me - for my personality , for the person , for the model i am and not because i will be the only black girl for the show			0
" this tokenistic attitude towards diversity is something @entity22 , @entity24 and @entity54 are trying to tackle			1
but designers complain that they do n't have enough good black models to choose from			2
" there are not enough models coming to castings that are black , " designer @entity151 told @entity32			2
" that 's basically not having the choice			0
" lasting change @entity24 also criticizes casting directors and stylists for their part in providing too few black models to designers			1
she says it 's an attitude that has to change			0
" i do n't want to ever hear again a young model telling me that [ casting directors ] have said to her : ' we are not seeing black models this season			2
' to me that 's offensive			0
to me that 's a racist remark			0
" the @entity71 hopes that by getting the conversation started and raising awareness of the lack of black models , they will force out discrimination from all corners of the industry			2
@entity22 says they 'll keep speaking out until they see real change that lasts from season to season			1
" we do n't want this to be a trend			0
we want this to last			0
" in this famously fickle industry , these three women have a fight on their hands .			0

@entity22 , @entity24 part of racial diversity initiative

@entity22 says she sees less diversity since she began modeling in 1986
