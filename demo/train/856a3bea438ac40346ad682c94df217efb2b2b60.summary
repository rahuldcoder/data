@entity0 -- the @entity5 administration is considering the possibility of removing all @entity8 troops in @entity9 after the @entity11 combat mission officially finishes at the end of 2014 , @entity3 officials said tuesday			1
the comments by @entity14 , the @entity3 's deputy national security adviser , come as the @entity15 and @entity3 mull over the number of troops that could be left in @entity9 after 2014 to fight insurgents and train @entity9 security forces			2
@entity9 president @entity20 and president @entity5 are scheduled to meet on friday in @entity0			1
presidents look to future of @entity9 @entity14 said the administration is considering a range of options , with one scenario having no @entity8 troops there			2
the range , according to defense officials , had until recently been between 6,000 and 15,000 @entity8 troops possibly remaining in the country , based on an assessment by the @entity8 top commander in @entity9 , gen. @entity34			2
" we have an objective of making sure there 's no safe haven for @entity39 within @entity9 and making sure that the @entity9 government has a security force that is sufficient , again , to assure the stability of the @entity9 government and the denial of that safe haven , " @entity14 said			0
" that 's what causes us to look for different potential troop numbers or not having potential troops in the country , " he continued			0
@entity14 said there were no expectations of any deal on post- 2014 troop levels during the @entity20 visit , and he said it could be months before any decision was made			0
suicide bombing kills 5 the @entity3 remains committed to ensuring @entity9 does not return to its status as a safe haven for @entity39 , @entity14 said " the president does not view these negotiations as having a goal of keeping @entity8 troops in @entity9 , " he said			2
" and we 're guided by the shared missions that we 've agreed to with the @entity9 , the training and equipping of their forces , and counterterrorism			0
" but the @entity8 also is insistent on legal protection for any troops in @entity9 after 2014			1
if there is no agreement on that between the @entity8 and @entity20 between now and the end of 2014 , then it could lead to a similar situation for the @entity8 as when it left @entity78			1
the refusal by the @entity78 government to extend legal protections for @entity8 troops after the end of the war in @entity78 was a major reason the @entity8 left the country with no residual military training force			1
but @entity20 has said he would like for @entity8 troops to remain after the end of the @entity11 mission			0
he also has been highly critical of the troops over the years , following incidents in which @entity8 forces have killed civilians			0
attack takes life of @entity96 soldier @entity8 defense officials are playing a wait - and - see game on what the @entity20 visit will produce			0
as one defense official told @entity1 on monday about the @entity9 president , " it 's @entity20 ; who knows what he will want on any given day ? "			1
