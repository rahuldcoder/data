-- in his weekly address , president @entity1 said that the @entity4 airline bomber acted under orders from an @entity7 branch in @entity8 , which " trained him , equipped him with those explosives and directed him to attack that plane headed for @entity13			1
" vowing to hold accountable all those involved in the attempted act of terrorism on @entity4 , @entity1 sent a letter to his @entity19 counterpart , @entity18 , delivered by gen. @entity20 , head of the @entity21 , in which he pledged to double the $ 70 million in counterterrorism aid to the poverty - stricken country in 2009 , a figure that does not include covert programs run by @entity13 special forces and the @entity28			1
with the increase in security assistance , @entity8 now tops @entity31 , which receives about $ 112 million , a clear indication of the growing threat of @entity34 ( known as @entity8 - based ) in @entity13 eyes			1
@entity13 strategy is driven by assumptions that do not fully recognize the complexity and gravity of the situation in @entity8			1
the first premise is that with increased @entity13 security assistance , the @entity8 government will take the fight to @entity7 and uproot it			1
secondly , @entity13 officials assume that confronting @entity7 requires mainly counterterrorism measures			1
what is alarming about the resurgence of this @entity7 branch is its linkage to @entity8 's deepening social and political crises and failing state institutions			1
in the last three years , against all odds , the @entity7 branch has revived the central organization 's declining fortune in the @entity57 and emerged as a potentially potent force			1
@entity34 numbers between 100 and 300 core operatives -- as many as those in @entity31 , though they are younger and lack the operational skills and sophistication of their @entity31 cohorts			0
most are rookies with little combat experience , unlike the previous @entity68 generation			0
the structure and composition of the @entity8 branch appears to have changed because of the merger with militant elements from @entity74 last january , forming @entity34 and revitalizing the jihadist network there			2
some fighters had returned from war zones in @entity78 , @entity68 and @entity31 and have supplied military training and ideological motivation and leadership			0
in 2007 i interviewed several hardened @entity19 and @entity74 returnees from @entity78 who made it clear that they would target @entity13 and @entity85 if @entity13 and @entity87 troops do not withdraw from @entity89 lands			1
these hard - liners were neither bluffing nor making empty threats			0
there are also some signs of cross-fertilization between @entity34 and @entity96 's @entity95 , an @entity7 like - minded group fighting for control of the war - torn country facilitated by the flow of thousands of @entity96 refugees to @entity8			1
that is not the whole story , however			0
the recent revival of @entity7 in @entity8 is a product of a structural socioeconomic crisis and political divisions and fault lines that have pushed the country to the brink of all - out war			1
@entity7 is a parasite feeding on lawlessness , social and political instability , and abject poverty and despair			1
today @entity8 is a fragile state with failing institutions and a collapsed economy			2
forty percent of the country 's 23 million people are unemployed			0
more than a third of the population is undernourished and almost 50 percent live in absolute poverty			0
@entity8 , the poorest @entity126 country , has one of the highest fertility rates			1
a huge youth explosion ( 60 percent of the population is under the age of 20 ) faces a grim future -- and radicalization			0
with every visit to this stunningly beautiful country , i observe a deteriorating security situation and declining social conditions			0
it is now common to see many women of all ages clad in black from head to toe begging on the streets of major cities , an alarming sign of social breakdown in an ultraconservative @entity89 society where women do not appear in public			0
the sound of @entity154 - made fighter jets often shatters the peace of the early hours of the morning			0
the jets are on their way to bomb @entity160 ( @entity161 ) rebels in the @entity164 province and the @entity166 district of @entity168 province , a mini-civil war in the north that has raged on and off for four years and has claimed more than a thousand lives , most of whom are civilians			0
a secessionist movement in the south has gained momentum , with a sizable segment of southern public opinion demanding a divorce from the forced union imposed by the north in the early 1990s			0
what the @entity7 branch has tried to do is to submerge and embed itself in these raging local conflicts and to position itself as the spearhead of opposition and resistance to the @entity18 regime			2
for example , @entity7 has allied itself with tribes in the separatist south in the fight against the central government , a radical move because many separatists are socialist and not religiously inclined			2
ironically , in 1994 president @entity18 relied greatly on jihadists and @entity197 to subdue the socialist south and unify @entity8			2
from his base in @entity200 , @entity201 , whose father was born in @entity8 , exhorted his men to fight the " @entity204 " in the south , who they massacred			2
the @entity7 - @entity8 connection goes back to the foundation of the jihadist organization			1
@entity8 has always had powerful @entity211 and jihadist movements			2
in the 1980s , thousands of @entity19 joined the @entity68 jihad against occupying @entity154 forces and most returned home emboldened and militarized			0
unlike their @entity217 counterparts , @entity19 returnees were welcomed by the @entity18 regime			0
in the early 1990s when @entity201 set up @entity7 in @entity200 and then in @entity68 , he heavily and personally recruited @entity19 whom he trusted			2
@entity201 , a @entity74 , has often said he has a soft spot in his heart for @entity8 because of its people 's religiosity and tribal code of honor and hospitality and harsh , mountainous landscape			1
the @entity74 - @entity19 contingent was the largest within the @entity201 organization , as well as in the detention facility at @entity231			0
many of his bodyguards , personal secretaries , drivers and cooks were @entity19			0
@entity34 chief @entity238 ( reportedly killed by a @entity13 - directed airstrike on december 24 ) , once served as @entity201 's personal secretary			2
@entity201 entrusted the protection and transportation of his wives and children to his @entity19 men , a fact that speaks volumes about his mindset			0
@entity13 officials appear to overestimate the capacity of the @entity8 government to meet the multiple challenges and threats to its authority and integrity			1
its security forces are spread thin			0
four years after the outbreak of the @entity160 rebellion , the state has failed to resolve it			0
more importantly , the government can no longer deliver the social goods and patronage , historically solid underpinnings of the @entity18 rule			0
the country has been badly affected by falling oil revenues ( @entity8 is the smallest oil producer in the @entity217 ) , pervasive corruption , and the international financial downturn			2
after more than three decades in power , president @entity18 's ability to co-opt adversaries and maintain friends has shrunk considerably , plunging @entity8 into an uncertain future			2
on its own , counterterrorism will most likely fail in expelling @entity7 from @entity8 's tribal areas and might trigger a backlash against the @entity18 regime and its @entity283 patrons			1
of all @entity217 , @entity19 voice strong anti-american foreign policy sentiments and take pride in sacrificing blood and treasure in defense of @entity126 and @entity89 causes			2
any @entity13 policy course that neglects the local context will help @entity7 sell its narrative to a receptive audience			1
what @entity8 desperately needs is a political and economic vision that tackles deteriorating security and social conditions and empowers state and society , not just the @entity18 regime			1
this vision can not be made in the @entity13			0
@entity8 's neighbors , particularly @entity74 and @entity302 , along with the @entity303 , should take the lead in finding solutions to @entity8 's political and tribal divisions and providing the means to prevent @entity8 from becoming a failed state			1
more than any other country , @entity74 has more to lose by the breakdown of its next - door neighbor			0
the @entity13 and @entity85 should provide leadership and assistance in shepherding the reconstruction process through and ensuring that inclusive governance , transparency , and accountability are adhered to			1
a good start is @entity87 prime minister @entity320 's call for a high - level international meeting this month to discuss ways of combating @entity7 influence in @entity8			1
but the most effective means to combat @entity7 is to to tackle @entity8 's structural social and political crisis and to fully involve @entity8 's @entity126 neighbors in the talks			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity329 .			0
