-- @entity2 warnings against the @entity3 emerged friday as the materials taken from @entity6 's compound continued to yield a trove of intelligence , including details about a possible attack on the 10th anniversary of 9/11			1
@entity2 , the @entity6 terrorist network that carried out the deadly attack in 2001 , confirmed its leader 's death on friday in a web statement and used that opportunity to taunt and threaten the @entity3			1
" @entity18 did n't build an organization that will vanish with his death or fades away with his departure , " according to the statement , which @entity0 could not independently authenticate			0
the statement , which congratulates the " @entity24 on the martyrdom of their devoted son @entity18 , " repeated themes and threats made over the years in prior @entity2 statements			0
" the blood of the mujahid sheikh , @entity6 , may @entity32 have mercy on him , is very dear to us and more precious to us and to every @entity35 from being shed in vain , " the statement said			0
a mujahid is defined as a muslim engaged in what he considers to be jihad			0
" this blood will be a curse that will chase the @entity3 and their agents , a curse that will pursue them inside and outside their country , and soon -- with @entity32 's help -- we pray that their happiness turns into sorrow and may their blood mix with their tears and let @entity18 's resonate again			1
" in its pronouncements , @entity2 frequently cites the conflict between @entity54 and the @entity55 , and it did so again , saying friday that @entity3 " will neither enjoy nor live in security until our people in @entity58 live it and enjoy it			1
" " the soldiers of @entity63 in groups and as individuals will continue to plan and plot without any fatigue , boredom , despair , surrender or indifference until you receive from them a cunning misfortune that will gray the hair of the child even before he gets old , " the statement said			0
@entity76 were urged to " rise up " and cleanse the " disgrace that was brought upon them by a handful of traitors and thieves " and " their country from the filth of the @entity3 who have wreaked havoc in the land			1
" the statement surfaced as protesters packed the streets of @entity89 -- where @entity6 was shot and killed -- in a rally organized by @entity91 , @entity76 's largest @entity92 party			1
the demonstrators denounced the @entity3 and @entity76 governments			1
also , the statement expressed disdain for the @entity3 , both its efforts and its motives , saying that the @entity3 managed to kill @entity6 " by disgrace and betrayal			1
" @entity6 was killed in a @entity101 raid on his compound early monday in @entity89 , a military garrison town north of the capital of @entity105			1
" men and heroes only should be confronted in the battlefields but at the end , that 's @entity32 's fate			0
still we ask , will the @entity3 be able -- through their media outlets , their agents , their instruments , soldiers , intelligence services and their might -- be able to kill what @entity18 lived for and was killed for ? how far ! how impossible ! " @entity6 was buried at sea in what @entity3 officials have described as a proper @entity24 burial			1
but the statement said if @entity3 treat the bodies of @entity6 or his family members improperly , either dead or alive , or do not hand over the bodies to families , there will be retribution			2
" any offense will open unto your doors of multitudes of evil for which you will only have yourselves to blame			0
" according to the statement , @entity6 recorded an audio message a week prior to his death regarding the revolutions sweeping the @entity35 world and offering advice and guidance			2
@entity2 indicated that the release of this message is forthcoming			0
meanwhile , investigators poring over material seized in the monday raid found details about a possible attack on the 10th anniversary of 9/11 , and the intelligence led thursday to a nationwide alert regarding rail security			0
as early as february 2010 , @entity2 members discussed a plan to derail trains in the @entity3 by placing obstructions on tracks over bridges and valleys , the alert said , according to one law enforcement official			1
the plan was to be executed later this year , coinciding with the 10th anniversary of the september 11 attacks , though no specific rail system was identified , the official said			0
the @entity166 confirmed a notice was sent to federal , state , local and tribal authorities			0
" we have no information of any imminent terrorist threat to the @entity3 rail sector , but wanted to make sure our partners are aware of the alleged plotting			0
it is unclear if any further planning has been conducted since february of last year , " spokesman @entity176 said			0
rail agencies across the @entity3 heightened security			0
the @entity181 reissued security bulletins , " reminding employees of what activities to look for and what steps to take should they encounter any suspicious or criminal activity during the course of their duties , " said @entity190 , a @entity181 spokeswoman			0
@entity193 employees also were on a heightened " state of vigilance , " spokesman @entity191 said			0
at @entity196 , @entity197 , president @entity195 thanked the troops for their efforts and vowed to achieve more			0
" we are going to ultimately defeat @entity2 , " he said to applause			1
" we have cut off their head and we will ultimately defeat them			2
" he said the @entity3 strategy is working , " and there is no greater evidence of that than justice finally being delivered to @entity6			2
" a @entity3 official said that " valuable information has been gleaned already " from the information gathered at @entity6 's compound , though no specific plots or terrorist suspects were identified			1
but the material suggests that @entity2 was particularly interested in striking @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 , according to the law enforcement official who spoke on condition of anonymity			2
@entity3 authorities have found that @entity2 appeared especially interested in striking on significant dates like july 4 , @entity226 and the opening day of the @entity228			2
the material seized from the compound included audio and video equipment , suggesting @entity6 may have taped messages there , a @entity3 official said			1
ten hard drives , five computers and more than 100 storage devices , such as disks and thumb drives , were also found , a senior @entity3 official told @entity0			2
the @entity242 reported on thursday that the @entity243 had a safe house in @entity89 " for a small team of spies " who performed surveillance on the compound			0
citing @entity3 officials , the effort " relied on @entity76 informants and other sources to help assemble a ' pattern of life ' portrait of the occupants and daily activities at the fortified compound where @entity6 was found			1
" it was " mobilized after the discovery of the suspicious complex last august that involved virtually every category of collection in the @entity3 arsenal , ranging from satellite imagery to eavesdropping efforts aimed at recording voices inside the compound , " the @entity242 reported			0
dozens of people in @entity89 have been arrested because of their suspected connections to the compound where @entity6 was shot and killed , a @entity76 intelligence official said friday			1
investigators want to know whether any of the people are @entity2 members or sympathizers			2
the @entity3 and @entity76 have been allies for years in the anti-terrorism effort , but @entity3 concerns that @entity76 have n't been robust enough in the fight against @entity24 militants and suspected @entity3 drone attacks that killed innocent civilians have heightened tensions			1
another suspected drone strike killed 12 suspected militants on friday in the @entity76 tribal region			0
questions remain over why and how @entity76 intelligence officials could not have known bin @entity6 was hiding out in the city , which is home to a military academy and has a strong military presence			1
@entity76 armed forces chiefs issued a statement thursday admitting " shortcomings in developing intelligence " on the terrorist leader 's presence in the country			2
the army chief of staff , gen. @entity308 , " made it very clear that any similar action , violating the sovereignty of @entity76 , will warrant a review on the level of military / intelligence cooperation with the @entity3 , " the statement said			1
since the raid , @entity76 has ordered @entity3 military personnel on its territory drawn down to the " minimum essential " level , the statement said .			2

new : " we are going to ultimately defeat @entity2 , " @entity195 says
dozens of people are arrested in @entity89 , a @entity76 intelligence official says
@entity2 says @entity6 's death will curse the @entity3
the group says it is n't going away and will continue to plot
