-- what if carbon dioxide were as black as oil ? when your house is on fire , you may not be in the mood to hear about an impending cancer epidemic that threatens your neighborhood , so i hesitate to bring up this topic			1
i have spent my scientific career studying oil spills , including the ongoing disaster in the @entity14 that killed 11 people in the initial rig blast and is causing epic environmental damage , havoc to lives and livelihoods , political tumult , huge economic losses and an incessant media drumbeat			1
but while we have readily and rightfully committed ourselves to understanding the cause of the spill , its effects and how to help restore the affected @entity29 region , we still ca n't seem to come to grips with a much more dangerous , far - reaching pollutant that is changing the fundamental chemistry of our entire planet : carbon dioxide			1
why the difference in concern ? is it as simple as out of sight , out of mind ? we can see oil discoloring the ocean , blackening coastlines and covering wildlife , but carbon dioxide is colorless and odorless			1
we do n't see it , and there 's no video or sound bites , so it 's easier to deny			2
@entity0 and other media outlets do not stream figures about carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere			1
but it has been spewing steadily and increasingly for decades throughout our planet from power plants , factories and our cars and homes			0
since 1960 , the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen from 310 to 390 parts per million			1
our eyes are riveted to watching the black trail of oil soiling @entity14 waters and coastlines			0
if carbon dioxide were black , we could actually see our atmosphere darkening with carbon dioxide , creating a heat - trapping blanket that is raising global air and ocean temperatures and threatening to dramatically rearrange our climate			1
would we care more if we could see the higher concentrations of carbon dioxide being absorbed into our oceans , making seawater more acidic , endangering coral reefs and marine life and threatening to fundamentally disrupt ocean ecosystems and food webs ? perhaps we ignore carbon dioxide because it 's hard for us to think long - term and connect the dots			1
the consequences of oil spills are immediate ; the causes and effects are obvious			0
not so with carbon dioxide ; its consequences are incremental , insidious and irreversible for centuries to millennia			1
people do n't easily understand how a small sea level rise can result in bigger storm surges and coastal damage , or how slight changes in ocean temperatures can change global rainfall patterns , leading to droughts and floods with catastrophic economic and societal consequences			2
even if we acknowledge the problem , there 's still the hurdle of doing something about it			0
it 's almost the same as asking , " if smokers could see their damaged lungs , would they quit more easily ? " just the way some people blame that problem on tobacco companies for manufacturing the product , it is easier to target blame for oil spills on oil companies			2
but smokers choose to use cigarettes and often get addicted ; similarly all of us who have been afforded the luxuries provided by cheap fossil fuels ca n't easily make difficult adjustments to wean ourselves away from them			2
( that does n't excuse tobacco companies for marketing cigarettes without revealing their dangers or oil companies taking drilling risks without being prepared for the consequences			0
) the @entity14 spill is a reminder that oil does n't come cheap			2
we will pay an enormous price in cleanup costs , economic losses and environmental and social damage			0
we do n't factor in those costs when we fill our gas tanks			0
and we do n't make the connection that gasoline , once burned , turns into its chemical sibling , carbon dioxide , whose effects on our environment will globally dwarf the catastrophe happening in the @entity14			1
few people imagined a catastrophe on such a scale , but we now see it 's possible and we are suffering the consequences			0
our seemingly invulnerable planet is fragile , too			0
we ignore that at our peril			0

@entity161 says oil spill is having *devastating* effect on the environment
he says the spill 's effects are so *visible* that the **public** *quickly* grasps the harm
@entity161 says the **public** ca n't come to grips with a greater threat , carbon dioxide
if carbon dioxide were black , people might see the damage it 's causing
