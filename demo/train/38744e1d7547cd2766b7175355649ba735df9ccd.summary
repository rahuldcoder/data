-- five - time defending champion @entity1 is bidding to match the record of a controversial tennis legend who dominated the sport in the 1920s but died in disgrace			1
@entity6 dominated tennis in the 1920s with his own trademark style			1
@entity10 @entity6 achieved fame and fortune through his tennis exploits and befriended @entity15 stars such as @entity16 , but he spent over a year in jail in the 1940s on a morals charge , which ruined his reputation before his untimely death in 1953			1
@entity6 won his six straight @entity23 titles from 1920 - 1925 - a record since the tournament abolished the challenge system - where the champion automatically qualified for the final - in 1911			1
under that system , @entity28 won the first seven editions of the @entity23 ( then the @entity23 ) in the 1880s			0
@entity6 , who claimed his seventh @entity10			2
open title in 1929 as well as being twice a losing finalist , goes down in the history books as one of the greatest tennis players of all time			0
a relatively late starter , @entity6 struggled to get into his college tennis team in @entity40 , but years of dedicated practice started to bear fruit after the @entity43 as he reached the @entity23 finals of 1918 and 1919			2
he reached his peak in the 1920s , winning his first @entity23 title and holding the world number one spot for seven straight years			2
@entity6 also led the @entity10 to a record seven straight @entity50 titles as well as claiming three @entity52 titles			1
his famed " cannonball " services worked particularly well on the fast grass surfaces on which the @entity23 and @entity52 were staged			0
@entity6 never won the @entity56 being losing finalist in the last year it was held on grass courts , in 1927 , and 1930 on clay			0
he won the last of his 10 grand slam titles at @entity52 in 1930 before deserting the amateur ranks for the fledging professional circuit eventually joined by the likes of @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , @entity6 remained a star attraction until well into his 40s , filling arenas such as @entity71 in big money matches			1
but off the court , @entity6 was a controversial figure , battling with tennis officials as his amateur status was called into question and being accused of being arrogant and inconsiderate			0
@entity6 , who never married , saw his reputation destroyed in the 1940s when he was found guilty of a morals charge in connection with a minor			2
he served seven - and - a - half months of a year jail term but was arrested again in 1949 after picking up a 16 - year - old male hitchhiker			0
@entity6 served a further 10 months for his probation violation and was shunned by the tennis community			1
his friendship with @entity89 stars such as @entity16 and a love of the theatrical world saw @entity6 pour much of his riches into less than successful @entity94 productions			0
he died a tragic figure in 1953 , having a stroke in @entity97 as he prepared for a trip to play in the @entity99 despite his 60 years of age			0
@entity6 was inducted into the @entity101 in 1959 and in any polls of all - time great tennis players always features in the top order			0
@entity1 , who won a record 15th grand slam title at @entity52 , is top seed at @entity106 , the venue since 1978 .			1

@entity1 seeking to match the six straight @entity23 wins of @entity6
@entity6 dominated tennis in the 1920s , winning 10 grand slam titles
the @entity10 legend served two *prison* sentences on morals charges in the 1940s
@entity6 was shunned by the tennis *comminty* and died at the age of 60
