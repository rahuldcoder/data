-- @entity1 was n't the only one being held by @entity1			1
but she knew she was different			0
" i was the punching bag			0
" and she took it -- day after day , month after month , year after year			0
the terror and torment lasted from august 2002 , when @entity1 lured @entity1 , then 21 , into his house with the promise of a new puppy , to may 6 , 2013 , when she and fellow captives @entity1 and @entity1 finally tasted freedom once again			1
how @entity1 lured her to the house speaking to @entity0 's @entity12 , @entity1 describes being chained to @entity1 , of being threatened with death if she did n't deliver @entity15 's baby alive and of screaming until she lost her voice in the 1,400 - square - foot , two - story home on @entity19 's @entity18			1
what she never lost was hope			0
after being starved , chained and repeatedly raped , after being brutalized physically and humiliated psychologically , @entity1 said that she actually got stronger			2
it might not have helped her in @entity1 's eyes , but @entity1 stayed defiant -- so much so that it became a source of pride			1
" all my life , i was made to feel insecure , like i was worthless , " she recalled			0
" and for the first time in my life , i stood up to a person that was a demeaning person			0
" " and it felt good to stand up for myself , ( because ) i never did before			1
" @entity32 was behind other abduction one year later , @entity1 is in a very different place			2
while @entity15 and @entity1 have largely stayed out of the public eye , @entity1 has done the opposite -- appearing at public events and writing a book , " finding me , " in hopes that her experiences will help people know they can survive anything			1
@entity1 , the daily devil in these three women 's lives for so long , is now out of the picture			1
arrested shortly after @entity15 and her then 6 - year - old daughter escaped to a neighbor 's house -- which led directly to the freeing of both @entity1 and @entity1 -- @entity1 killed himself in custody last september			1
before last may , neighbors had known him as an affable guy who 'd wave or eat ribs with them on his porch			0
for years , @entity1 drove children around in a school bus			2
he jammed with fellow musicians in salsa bands			0
but none of these people -- not even his closest relatives -- knew @entity1 's deep , dark secrets			1
@entity1 was the first such secret , having accepted a ride from @entity1 after leaving a @entity67 in the northern @entity68			2
nine months later , he took @entity15 as she walked home from her job at @entity71 on the eve of her 17th birthday			2
@entity1 said when she first saw tv reports of this latest abduction , her first thought was that @entity1 was responsible			2
while the two did n't interact much -- according to @entity1 's rules -- @entity1 said that @entity15 got better food , blankets , " basically whatever she wanted except for home			1
" " he had a fascination with her , more than me , " @entity1 recalled			1
" she was the wife - type person			0
i was the punching bag			0
" did n't speak out because ' i did n't want to get shot ' in april 2004 , @entity1 nabbed @entity1 shortly after she was last seen with his own biological daughter , @entity90 , at a pay phone			1
@entity1 and @entity1 , all of 14 at the time of her kidnapping , became close in more ways than one			2
they were chained together by the feet inside a small room			0
and they leaned on each other emotionally as well			0
" when we were sad and got knocked down by things that he said , we would tell each other , ' it 's ok , ... one day day it will be over , ' " @entity1 said			1
" we ( tried ) to encourage ourselves to keep hope that we would go home , even though sometimes we did n't feel like they were			0
" there was no roaming the halls , no freedom without a threat			0
@entity1 remembered going outside once and seeing other people			2
but she did n't dare speak up , knowing that @entity1 had a gun on him " everywhere he went			1
" she said flatly , " i did n't want to get shot			0
" ' at least i 'm still alive ' that threat was never more real than when @entity15 went into labor with @entity1 's child			1
her paternity was later confirmed by dna tests			0
the baby girl was born into a plastic tub to contain the afterbirth and amniotic fluid			0
but she was n't breathing , said @entity1 , who had helped deliver the child			1
" at that point in time , i knew what he said : ' if the baby did n't come out breathing , i 'll kill you , ' " recalled @entity1			1
@entity15 's baby delivered by another captive throughout her harrowing ordeal , @entity1 said she coped in part by remembering her own child , whom she 'd given birth to at age 17			1
she told @entity12 that she 'd write songs and poems to him , among other musings " about what happened to me ( and ) things that i never had , things that i wanted			0
" and @entity1 worked , as best as she could , to find something , anything positive to hold on to			2
" i ( would ) take myself outside of myself and look at a brighter side : at least i 'm not dead yet , " she said			0
" at least i 'm still alive and breathing			0
" @entity1 recounts her experience to @entity157 @entity0 's @entity158 contributed to this report .			1

@entity1 says @entity1 had " a fascination " with fellow captive @entity1
she calls her defiance of @entity1 a source of pride ; " it felt good to stand up for myself "
@entity1 had a gun with him " everywhere , " threatened her if @entity15 's *newborn* did n't live
@entity1 coped by talking with a fellow captive , writing to her son , taking *solace* in being alive
