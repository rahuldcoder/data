-- @entity1 has regained the women 's world number one ranking from @entity5 's @entity4 , after beating @entity6 to reach the semifinals of the @entity8 on friday			1
the @entity9 eased past the ninth seed 6 - 2 6 - 4 , and will now replace @entity11 champion @entity4 when the new @entity13 rankings are published on monday			1
@entity4 , who skipped the hard - court event in the @entity15 , will have held the number one ranking for just seven days			2
the 27 - year - old rose to the top spot again -- having first done so in 2003 -- when she reached the last four of the @entity21 , but left @entity1 with a chance to reclaim the position when she lost to @entity25 in the final			1
@entity27 : can @entity28 become a grand slam champion ? the 20 - year - old @entity1 will now remain at the top of the rankings at least until after the @entity33 tournament in @entity34 which starts on march 23			1
however , the 2009 @entity36 finalist -- who is yet to win a grand slam title -- insisted winning tournaments is more important to her than being no. 1			0
" i 've said all along i was n't sure about whether i could become number one this week , and that my focus really is not upon that , " she told reporters			0
" for the moment it 's more important to concentrate on what i have to do and try to win the tournament			2
" her achievement was marked in a much more low - key fashion then when she became the 20th woman in history to reach the summit in october last year			0
due to fears over the safety of @entity6 -- who became the first woman from @entity57 to play in the @entity59 state in 2010 -- the match was played on a remote outside court with few spectators and heavy security , where there were no on - court celebrations			0
next up for @entity1 will be @entity66 former world no. 1 @entity1 , who defeated @entity69 fourth seed @entity67 of @entity69 in three closely - contested sets			1
sixth seed @entity1 eventually triumphed 6 - 3 5 - 7 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) against world no. 5 and @entity74 runner - up @entity67			1
in the other half of the draw , two - time grand slam champion @entity75 of @entity77 beat @entity81 eighth seed @entity82 7 - 6 ( 9 - 7 ) 6 - 3 in the penultimate quarterfinal			0
the @entity77 will next face @entity85 11th seed @entity84 , who thrashed @entity77 's @entity86 6 - 2 6 - 0 in the late match			0
elsewhere , at the men 's @entity92 , @entity91 top seed and world no. 4 @entity88 progressed to the semifinals with an easy straight - sets win over @entity97 's @entity96			1
the two - time @entity74 finalist came through 6 - 1 6 - 4 , and will next play @entity99 after the @entity77 defeated @entity101 fourth seed @entity102 6 - 4 2 - 6 6 - 1 in friday 's closing match			0
in the other half of the draw of the @entity106 @entity106 hard - court tournament , world no. 7 and @entity109 runner - up @entity110 was knocked out by @entity112 's @entity111			2
the former world number nine swept aside his @entity115 opponent 6 - 3 6 - 4 to book his place in the semifinals of the @entity97 event , where he will face third seed @entity121			2
the @entity77 ended home hopes with a 6 - 4 2 - 6 6 - 4 win over sixth seed @entity125 .			0
