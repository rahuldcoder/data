@entity0 is the only known person born in a @entity3 prison camp that escaped and survived to tell the tale			1
journalist @entity5 first uncovered @entity7 's story in 2008 and has now turned it into the riveting new biography " escape from @entity10 : one man 's @entity11 from @entity3 to @entity13 in the @entity14			1
" @entity3 has been splashed across world headlines in recent weeks over its threat to launch a long - range rocket , its suspected nuclear program and for its continued defiance of the @entity14			1
if you want a singular perspective on what goes on inside the rogue regime , then you must read his story			1
it 's a harrowing tale of endurance and courage , at times grim but ultimately life - affirming			2
in the book , @entity5 offers an unnerving glimpse into one of the world 's most repressive regimes			1
until now , little was known about @entity3 's labor camps , even though they 've existed for decades			1
they 're believed to hold between 150,000 and 200,000 prisoners and while they 're plainly visible in satellite photos , the @entity3 government claims they do n't exist			1
he was born in one of these " hidden gulags			2
" he grew up in squalid conditions with unending , back - breaking work , and knew nothing of the outside world			2
he was starved , beaten and tortured			0
one of his earliest memories : being forced to watch the execution of his mother and brother			0
it was n't until @entity7 was 23 years old he was able to climb through a high - voltage fence and escape			2
somehow , @entity7 found his way to @entity53 , @entity54 , and eventually the @entity55			0
today , @entity7 lives in @entity56 , but is still dealing with the psychological trauma of his former life in the camp			2
@entity5 , a reporter for @entity60 and a contributor to @entity62 , brings @entity7 's amazing story to life			1
@entity65 recently spoke to him about the book and his relationship with @entity7			2
the following is an edited transcript : @entity65 : this is an amazing story , how did you learn about @entity7 and when did you first meet him ? @entity5 : i heard about @entity7 from a human rights activist in @entity74 , where i was living and working as a correspondent for the @entity76			2
at the time , i was desperately searching for a way to write about life inside @entity3			1
i quickly flew to @entity56 and met @entity7 there for lunch in december , 2008			0
that meeting is detailed in the book			2
@entity65 : what did you think of @entity7 and how difficult was it to confirm the details of his story ? watch an interview with @entity0 @entity5 : talking to @entity7 in person , his story sounds believable			1
it 's because of the intensity and precision of his memory			2
his body , too , is a map of what he endured , with burns on his back and legs , and his partially - severed finger			0
his arms are bowed from childhood labor			0
confirming the details of his story is impossible , if you mean going to @entity10 and asking questions of his captors and torturers			1
@entity3 denies the existence of @entity10 and all the other labor camps			1
outsiders , including the ( @entity110 ) , have never been allowed to visit them			0
the only way for @entity3 to " refute , contradict or invalidate " the testimony of @entity7 and other camp survivors would be to permit outsiders to visit the camps			1
otherwise , their testimony stands			0
@entity65 : what did you find most shocking or disturbing about @entity7 's ordeal ? @entity5 : his anger at his mother -- and his statement that he was glad to see her die : these were the things that shocked me most upon meeting @entity7			2
but as we continued to talk -- over the course of day - long conversations that extended for weeks in @entity56 and later in @entity132 -- i came to understand that guards had raised him to be suspicious of everyone			0
he saw anyone who stood between him and his next meal as a potential enemy			0
he was raised to see personal redemption in acts that ratted out his own family			0
he believed that his mother , by discussing an escape plan with @entity7 's brother , had been irresponsible and reckless			1
since he was a toddler , he had been forced to memorize camp rules that prescribe death for anyone who tries to escape or knows about an escape plan but does not report it immediately			1
the moment @entity7 heard that his mother was considering an escape , his camp - bred instincts kicked in			1
he had to betray her : he knew that if he did not , it would mean his torture or death			0
he did turn her in			0
but he was tortured anyway			0
watch the book trailer for " escape from @entity10 " @entity65 : how is @entity7 doing now ? @entity5 : he is now living in @entity56 , after spending the better part of two years in @entity161 , @entity132 ; @entity162 ; @entity164 , @entity163 , and @entity165 has begun working with a partner on a webcast aimed at telling the @entity3 - speaking world more about @entity3 and the camps			1
his life 's goal is to raise awareness of the camps			0
he wants them closed as soon as possible			0
everything else in his life is secondary to that goal			0
that is why he was willing to go though the misery of long interviews with me			0
in the book , in trying to explain how painful those interviews often were , i used the image of a dentist drilling without anesthetics -- for more than two years			0
@entity7 did not like it , but he put up with it because he wants everyone to know what went on in @entity10 -- what still goes on			1
@entity65 : @entity7 must have left a lasting impression on you , what kind of impact did his story have on you personally ? @entity5 : his story has obviously touched me profoundly			0
and like him , i want everyone in the world to know about the camps and to understand -- through an emotionally wrenching immersion in @entity7 's life inside @entity10 -- that @entity3 's dictatorship is sustained by child slavery , starvation , and unimaginable cruelty			1
