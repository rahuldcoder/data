during a surprisingly emotional appearance before a congressional panel on tuesday , @entity0 , the @entity1 's executive vice president of football operations , admitted the league made a " crucial mistake " in its initial punishment of @entity6 and got choked up when describing his commitment to improving their policies			1
" i 've committed my life , worked for the last 20 years as an advocate against domestic violence in an effort to keep others from experiencing this lifetime pain , " @entity0 said , his voice strained			1
" i relate to the twenty million victims -- survivors -- of domestic violence , sexual abuse , in every community across our great nation			1
" @entity24 pointed questioning from sen. @entity25 , @entity26 , and sen. @entity27 , @entity28 , who serve on the @entity29 , before which @entity0 appeared , the @entity1 executive admitted the league should have acted sooner in punishing the @entity34 cornerback			1
@entity6 was seen in two separate videos assaulting his then - fiancee , now wife , @entity36			1
the @entity1 initially handed down a two - game suspension for the star , before deciding to rethink the punishment and suspend him indefinitely			2
" i do n't think there was a need for a second video to impose a proper discipline , " @entity0 told @entity27 , the committee 's top @entity41			1
" we failed in that particular area ... we made a critical mistake			2
" @entity36 : @entity6 was ' terrified ' after hitting me the first video , posted by @entity52 in january , shows @entity6 dragging the unconscious @entity36 out of a hotel elevator			2
the second video , released in september , shows @entity6 hitting her with such great force that it knocks her unconscious , before he proceeds to drag her out of the elevator			2
the league has consistently denied that it saw the second video before it was posted online by @entity52			0
but , as @entity27 pointed out in the hearing , the league admitted in a june testimony that it suspected that a full video of the incident did exist			0
@entity0 said regardless of whether the league had access to the video , or knew of its existence , it should have taken action sooner			1
" as we look at our personal conduct policy , we failed , " @entity0 said			2
" the commissioner failed to impose the proper @entity6 penalty in the beginning			0
" @entity1 commissioner @entity75 has also denied having ever been granted access to the second video , telling @entity76 in september , " we asked for anything that 's pertinent , but we were never granted that opportunity			1
" according to @entity0 , the @entity1 is working to hard reform their process of dealing with issues of domestic violence , with the goal of both preventing and punishing such misbehavior			1
" we believe that wearing a uniform of @entity1 player is a privilege , " he said			0
" it is not a right			0
every member of the @entity1 community must embrace this unique leadership role that we play in our society and the trust that you place in us			0
" but at the same time , @entity0 stressed his commitment to ensuring that players receive fair due process			0
" i support the interests of all players in a fair process , " @entity0 said			0
" i have led these efforts			0
i know that a majority of our current and former players are terrific husbands , fathers and men who have made incredible contributions to their communities			0
" @entity0 said he expects the full investigation into the @entity6 episode to conclude " at any time " and he believes the report will be made public			1
opinion : @entity6 does n't deserve second chance			0

top @entity1 executive tells congressional panel the league made a mistake in its initial disciplining of @entity6
