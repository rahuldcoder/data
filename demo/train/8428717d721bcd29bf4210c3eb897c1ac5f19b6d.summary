-- call them the " meh - mmys			1
" sure , when it comes to television 's most prestigious award , the @entity3 tries			2
when the center of gravity moved to cable , the @entity7 followed , giving " @entity13 , " " @entity14 " and " @entity15 " the same kind of attention it once gave " @entity12 " and " @entity16			1
" when new genres and new technology arose , the @entity3 responded , creating categories for reality shows and " short - format live - action entertainment programs " ( i.e. , online video )			1
and it 's hard to argue with this year 's nominees			2
even the most questionable of the bunch -- " @entity15 , " " @entity26 , " @entity28 's love it - or - hate it turn as @entity30 -- represent a level of professionalism and quality that should be acknowledged			1
then why do the 65th @entity7 feel so ... meh ? one reason is the same - old , same - old factor : that the @entity7 tend to nominate the same shows ( or the same types of shows ) every year , says longtime awards watcher @entity39 of @entity40			1
" tv is infamous for its reruns -- that 's the nature of the boob tube -- and it 's hard to whip up excitement when the same contenders return year after year , " he says			1
for example , he points out , this year there 's only one new show among the 12 nominees for best drama and best comedy , and that 's " @entity55 , " which came from a non-network , @entity54			2
( another show , @entity58 's " @entity57 , " was nominated for the first time , though it just concluded its third season			2
) ' @entity55 ' creator @entity61 plays a solid hand @entity64 's tv critic , @entity63 , adds a corollary to @entity39 's observation			2
nowadays , there 's so much worthwhile programming out there that the @entity7 , even when nominating good shows , feel safe and conservative -- and , therefore , somewhat dull			1
" for the most part , the @entity7 do a pretty good job considering the impossibility and the ridiculousness of their task , " he said			1
the new , new tv golden age he compares the awards with the two other major entertainment honors , the @entity81 and @entity82			2
the former are often so hidebound to prestige productions -- you know the kind -- that they make us angry , @entity63 says			1
the latter awards , on the other hand , are so absurd that they make us laugh			2
and the @entity7 ? " they get under our skin in a different way , because they come so close , " he said			1
" we often think that they should be getting it right , and they 're awfully near to doing it			0
" everyone 's a critic indeed , it 's often more fun -- especially in these days of 500 channels and a comparable number of interesting shows -- to single out the so - called snubs			1
there are the obvious ones , of course			0
" @entity111 " did n't make it			0
neither did " @entity112 , " " @entity113 , " " the @entity114 " and " @entity115			0
" emmys 2013 : who got snubbed ? but there are also several other shows that missed out in lesser categories			1
for example , @entity127 's " @entity126 " is hugely popular and , given the hazy reality and clever editing of " reality " shows , obviously well - crafted			1
it was completely ignored by the @entity7			1
and if " @entity126 " is the kind of heartland - favored show sneered at by critics ( though , counter to perceptions , many have praised it ) , what about @entity137 's " @entity136 " ? it 's well - written and features a bravura performance by @entity140 as several clones with distinct personalities			0
it also garnered zero nominations			0
fans on @entity146 were not happy			0
( but what else is new ? ) as @entity155 's @entity154 said in reviewing the nominations , " it 's @entity150 season , time for nominations that come with no rhyme or reason ! " but even @entity63 , who wryly notes that he 's a " professional tv watcher , " finds it hard to keep up			1
there 's so much to live - blog and track that a show like " @entity136 " can slip through the cracks until , suddenly , there 's an outcry , he says			0
" people who are more plugged in than i am , maybe they were a little late in discovering a show that launched in january , " he said			0
" it 's a testament to the way the culture works now , that it sort of trickled down and people can discover something months after it debuted			0
" and it 's a good indicator of how much good stuff there is for the watching , he adds			0
" you have to look at the positives			0
this year , people are taking for granted that @entity181 got nominated or ' @entity182 , ' " he said			0
" i think the arguments people are making for snubs this year were a little ticky - tack and reflected how things like @entity146 have made us all tv critics			0
" ' @entity189 ' or ' class ' ? this does n't mean the @entity7 ca n't provide negative indicators , though			1
the most notable is , of course , the struggle for broadcast network shows to make the emmy cut			1
for all of the discussion about audience declines and new paradigms , the broadcast networks still draw relatively large audiences for their biggest hits			0
" ncis , " for example , draws more than 20 million people a week , and even " @entity206 , " which has been in a slow audience decline for years , still pulls 11 million viewers each week			1
however , of the 12 shows nominated for best comedy and best drama , only three are on commercial broadcast networks			2
( a fourth , " @entity214 , " is on @entity215			0
) it 's the cable shows , with their hard - core fan bases and chattering - class chatter , that get most of the buzz			1
that does n't necessarily help boost ratings for the @entity150 , which try to appeal to all tv watchers			1
it 's the same problem the @entity81 face when the @entity227 nominates a bunch of worthy , but low - grossing , films : without the draw of blockbuster nominees , water - cooler interest wanes			0
( and so do ratings			0
) but the broadcast networks have n't helped their cause , says @entity63			0
" the real tragedy is the way the networks have not been able to make the pivot , " he said			0
" what they do best is reach as many people as possible , but what they 've been doing is either reaching for the lowest common denominator or trying to lurch themselves into being like cable , which never works out well for anyone			0
" in picking the winners , the @entity248 has also risked alienating its audience , says @entity39			0
" the one thing you can usually count on with @entity150 voting is unabashed elitism and snobbism , " he said			1
the shows that win , he points out , are " highly styled , very upscale , aspirational shows			2
" that explains why a show like " @entity259 , " the top - rated sitcom that won a slew of other honors during its long run -- including a @entity264 -- never won the @entity150 for best comedy series			1
with its brassy lead and working - class setting , " it represented all the things that made ( emmy voters ) disgusted , " @entity39 said			0
expect the unexpected what could raise interest in the @entity7 ? the show could add more nominees to its major categories , as the @entity81 have done for best picture			1
that would allow it to welcome a broader range of shows , whether low - rated but passionately watched programs such as " @entity136 " or popular , well - crafted but overlooked dramas such as " @entity283			1
" but an even more intriguing idea would be to have an additional category -- call it " @entity291 " or " @entity292 " -- that throws every major nominee , as well as some fan picks , into the mix. it could be the @entity150 equivalent of the @entity289 basketball tournament or the @entity82 ' many - genre album of the year category			1
" i think it would be a very good reflection of how we watch tv now , " he said			2
" that would be fascinating to watch			2
" but , in the meantime , we 'll just have to make do with the nominees and categories we have , not the nominees and categories we want			0
@entity306 's @entity39 , for one , does n't expect too many surprises : " @entity308 " for best drama , " @entity310 " for best comedy and the usual bunch of trophies for @entity314 -- which won 20 on sunday at the @entity315 , where many categories were presented			2
( @entity0 's original series " @entity319 " won two awards			0
) and , despite the presence of host @entity322 , ratings may take a beating , thanks to a face - off against @entity298 's no. 1 show -- that would be @entity329 's " @entity328 " -- and the penultimate episode of " @entity308 " on @entity331			2
but , @entity39 adds , you never know			0
there are any number of tea leaves that indicate one thing and then do n't pan out at all			0
it 's enough to actually create some excitement			2
" you stop using logic , " he said			0
" this is the @entity7			1
" the 65th @entity150 are scheduled to air sunday on @entity342 from @entity344 ' @entity343 .			1

the @entity150 often fall short of capturing fan excitement for certain shows
with more choices of what to watch -- and when -- many quality shows get overlooked
still , the @entity7 appeal to many viewers
