-- the millennial generation is big , diverse and changing the @entity3 landscape			1
a new infographic and book , " @entity8 , " by @entity6 and the @entity7 , examines the data about the change			1
@entity6 calls the demographic transformations " dramas in slow motion			0
" the gen y -- or millennial -- generation 's lack of religious affiliation , indifference to political parties and strong liberal views are a contrast to previous generations			1
additionally , a great deal of the " next " in " @entity8 " has to do with racial and ethnic identity			0
immigration , intermarriage and the growing percentages of people who identify as mixed race are drastically recoloring the nation 's racial tapestry			1
today , just a half - century after interracial marriages were illegal in one - third of the states , nearly 1 in 6 newlyweds marry across racial lines			0
immigrants and their children are projected to make up about 37 % of @entity3 's population by mid-century , the highest share in our history			1
but what does this all mean ? there is often a focus on data highlighting the size and diversity of the millennial generation , drawing the conclusion that it is inevitable that our values will soon take over			1
but research shows other factors are equally important : our generation 's economic insecurity , dependence on our parents and most notably , the unprecedented size of the older generation			1
i want to challenge the notion of inevitability , that just because we are more diverse , liberal and " huge , " millennials will soon win the culture wars and easily transform our society to reflect our values			1
in my early 20s , as a gen y proselytizer and a person of color , i thought i knew exactly what the demographic changes meant : millennials , in all of our black , brown and liberal glory , were taking over politically			1
i spent the early part of my career working on progressive policies and cause campaigns geared toward youth and diverse communities			0
i even founded a program that applied a racial equity lens to public policy development in part because of the country 's changing demographics			1
the unspoken premise was this : political elites had better " get hip " and start authentically working toward equity			0
otherwise , they would be left in the change - making millennial dust			1
this premise was grounded in what i now call the myth of inevitability			2
although i worked hard to increase civic engagement , activism and community involvement amongst my peers , deep down inside , i believed that the odds were in our favor			0
we would inevitably win the culture wars because of our sheer size and diversity			0
i believed that increasing our involvement and voice would make the difference of when the @entity3 would be transformed to reflect our values , not if			1
others deeply believed this to be true , too			0
but there are a few important factors that we forgot to consider			0
first , the country is n't just young and diverse			0
it is also getting old very quickly			0
the second major demographic " drama " detailed by @entity7 is one of older @entity3 living longer than ever before			1
ten thousand baby boomers will turn 65 every single day between now and 2030			0
for the first time , by 2060 , there will be almost as many @entity3 older than 85 as younger than 5			1
thus the joke about " waiting for the older generation to die off " to see our political and social goals realized is n't just crass : it not a realistic path to social change			1
and that 's not all			2
there are other cultural realities standing in the way of an " inevitable " political takeover			1
millennials are economically insecure , politically unaffiliated and , according to @entity7 , not at all interested in generational warfare			2
unlike previous generations , we actually like our parents and grandparents -- perhaps because we 're still living with them			0
suddenly , revolution does n't look as inevitable as it once did			2
but it is still possible			0
i propose that the value wars that play out on issues such as immigration , women 's rights , equality , criminal justice and @entity3 's treatment of the poor will be determined by three factors : participation , leadership and systems innovation			1
participation in the political process is key			2
in the research from @entity7 , it confirms that millennial voting has actually been remarkably solid , increasing and staying strong in presidential elections since 2004			2
if this continues , adequate political representation should follow			0
but leading and participating in the system is not enough when the systems are broken , such as the impending doom around @entity171 and other programs if left as is			0
the only way to fix them is to innovate and create them anew			0
innovation can come from first learning the ins and outs of the current system , applying creativity and technological prowess to the problems and third , taking the risk to experiment and start enterprises that challenge the status quo if and when necessary			2
the data about the country 's race and age transformation is clear			2
but millennials will only make a transformational political impact when we take the reins , lead and recreate the @entity3 from the inside out			1
now that will be a demographic drama worth watching			0
