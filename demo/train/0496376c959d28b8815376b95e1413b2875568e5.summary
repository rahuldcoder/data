@entity1 , @entity0 -- was last year 's financial crisis a chance event ? or was it the product of 35 million years of evolution ? @entity8 ' research suggests that some of the bad choices made on @entity11 and in the mortgage business may have been deeply rooted in the basic nature of the human species			1
@entity15 , a professor at @entity16 , has been investigating the workings of a dangerous inconsistency in people 's attitudes to risk			2
she spoke about it wednesday at the @entity24 conference in @entity1 , a four - day event ending friday where experts passionate about their work got the chance to give contrasting views of the future we all face			1
which would you do : accept a guaranteed gift of $ 500 or gamble by taking a risk on a coin toss that would give you $ 1,000 for heads -- and nothing for tails ? most people would play it safe and take the sure $ 500 , @entity15 said			2
what if , instead of a gain , you faced a potential loss ? your choice would be to give up $ 500 for sure or take a risk on a coin toss that could cost you $ 1,000 if you lost -- or nothing if you won ? most people opt for taking the risk rather than playing it safe			2
using tokens as a form of money and grapes as prized products to be exchanged for the tokens , @entity15 has shown that capuchin monkeys make the same set of irrational choices -- taking more risk when they have something to lose than when they have something to gain			1
" the errors we make are predictable , we make them again and again , " said @entity15 , explaining that she wants to learn " how a species as smart as we are " can make such persistent mistakes			1
we can overcome our biological limitations , she said , but first we have to recognize what they are			2
adding to the pressure on the human species is the future we 're staring down			2
@entity82 , professor of sustainable development at the @entity83 , imagined the world in 2050			1
to keep greenhouse gases from reaching an unsustainably damaging level , the needed improvements in energy efficiency would have to occur at a pace 10 times faster than at any time in history			0
and , @entity82 said thursday , the only times the world has made substantial improvements in reducing carbon emissions have been during recessions			1
he views the world economy as built on an engine of growth that feeds the appetite of people in @entity102 countries for novelty , for ever more consumer goods that impress others but that can only be purchased by creating more debt			0
even if we do n't want the products , we have to buy them -- or the economy crashes			2
in what has probably been the most cited quote of the conference on @entity115 , @entity82 said , " we spend money we do n't have on things we do n't need to create impressions that wo n't last on people we do n't care about			1
" does that mean our choice boils down to this : crash the economic system or trash the planet ? not exactly , according to @entity82			1
the answer , he said , lies in creating socially responsible businesses and nonprofits that plow money back into " protecting and nurturing " the environment on which our future depends			2
as an example , he cited ecosia.org , a search engine that says it allocates 80 percent of its search - related revenues to a rainforest protection project in the @entity138			0
@entity15 and @entity82 were by no means the only speakers at @entity24 to suggest people make dumb choices but can overcome them by taking the right measures			1
@entity24 is a nonprofit that distributes " @entity147 " through its conferences and through more than 700 talks freely available at its web site			1
[ @entity2 partners with @entity24 to present one talk every tuesday , along with added content			1
] among the topics and speakers were : making the web really worldwide @entity153 , of the @entity154 at @entity155 , showed that while the framework and theory of the internet is global , in reality , web traffic tends to stay within a user 's country and social networks are generally segregated			1
we think we 're getting a wide view of the world by going online , but " most of the time we 're checking @entity168 scores , " he said			0
since the most compelling problems in the world are global , it will take global solutions to fix them			0
@entity153 urges people to become xenophiles , people who take an active interest in other lands			1
watch @entity153 's talk at @entity24 a headset that reads your brain @entity182 , the head of @entity183 , demonstrated a headset that uses brain activity and facial expressions to control computers and other devices			1
a volunteer was able to manipulate the image of a cube on a computer screen using the headset , and @entity182 showed how facial expressions , such as a blink or a smile , could control the movement of a wheelchair			0
packaging material that biodegrades @entity200 demonstrated an organic replacement for @entity202 , which winds up taking huge amounts of space in landfills and contributes to the stream of waste in the @entity208 and other bodies of water			0
@entity200 showed how fungi can be used to transform crop waste into recyclable packaging that blends back into the soil when it is discarded			0
aiming for a zero - waste supermarket chef @entity216 , who developed green restaurants in @entity218 , has now opened " @entity219 , " which aims to produce virtually no food waste			0
he said food is one of the most wasteful industries in the world but that practices including composting and allowing diners to choose how big a portion they want can dramatically reduce waste			0
" if we do n't stand up and make a difference and think about sustainable food , we will fail , " he said			1
are whales and dolphins wise ? marine wildlife researcher @entity234 , who studies dolphins and whales , says the question should n't only be are these mammals intelligent ; she asks whether we should say they are wise			2
they exhibit strong social behavior and reach out to humans , even though they 're often hunted and sometimes driven close to extermination			0
she showed videos of a pair of free - ranging dolphins in the @entity247 rubbing pectoral fins to show affection , of a beluga whale in eastern @entity251 watching its reflection in a large camera lens , of an orca mimicking a person 's whistling sound , of a gray whale in the eastern @entity208 that allowed people in a small boat to rub her newborn calf even though the mother bore a harpoon scar			0
she also told the story of a pod of dolphins encircling a swimmer who was having difficulty in the water until human rescuers could come to her aid			0
online video is revolutionizing the world 's talent @entity24 curator @entity275 sketched the potential for online video to do for communication what the @entity280 printing press did for writing			1
online video can drive " crowd - accelerated innovation " that elevates the work of emerging dancers , artists , teachers and thinkers , who can see what their peers are doing everywhere			0
the rise of online video allows " the world 's talent to be shared , " @entity275 said			0
" who 's the teacher ? you 're the teacher ... capable of carrying all of us to a smarter , wiser place			0
