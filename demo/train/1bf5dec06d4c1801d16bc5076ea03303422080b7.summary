-- @entity2 police are now confident that a shooter who killed three people at the @entity7 of @entity2 was carrying a camera to record the attack , a senior @entity2 law enforcement official told @entity0 tuesday			1
initial analysis of the surveillance footage from saturday 's attack in @entity13 had not conclusively shown he was carrying a video camera			1
however , the police still do not have leads on the identity or the whereabouts of the shooter , nor on the gunman 's specific motivation or ideological background , the official said			1
the official told @entity0 that investigators do not believe the attack was a " hit " targeting an @entity28 couple who were two of those killed			1
there has been media speculation in the past several days in @entity28 and @entity2 that the couple had ties to @entity28 intelligence agencies			1
" it 's clear from the surveillance video that the @entity28 couple were not specifically targeted by the gunman			1
we believe they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time , " the official said			1
" if they had been the specific target , the gunman would not have continued with his attack by entering the museum			2
" the two israelis killed were a couple in their 50s from @entity53 , @entity28 's @entity49 said			1
the third victim was a @entity55 woman			0
a fourth person shot , a @entity2 national who works at the museum , remains in critical condition , deputy public prosecutor @entity56 said monday			2
that contradicted museum spokeswoman @entity61 , who said sunday that the fourth person had died			0
@entity63 assault rifle images from the museum in @entity13 show the gunman behind saturday 's deadly attack approaching the building , opening fire , and walking away			2
he used an @entity63 assault rifle to carry out the shooting , police said sunday			0
photographs and video released by @entity2 police show the man wearing a cap and blue shirt , carrying two bags over his shoulder			1
the images do not show his face clearly			0
the shooter left on foot after the attack and headed toward a different part of downtown @entity13 before he disappeared , according to police			1
authorities are hunting the suspect , who is believed to have acted alone , @entity56 said			0
investigators hope the public will help to identify the suspect			2
terrorism has not been ruled out , @entity56 said monday			0
could the killer attack again ? it has been challenging to identify the killer because he was wearing a baseball cap , the senior @entity2 law enforcement official told @entity0 on monday			1
there is concern that the gunman could strike again , the official said , and that authorities could be dealing with a " @entity109 " type of killer			2
@entity109 , a @entity55 - @entity111 @entity110 radical who received terror training with @entity114 - linked militants in @entity115 , shot and killed three @entity55 paratroopers in two attacks in march 2012 before killing three schoolchildren and their teacher at a @entity7 school in @entity121 , @entity55 , during a 10 - day shooting rampage which he filmed with a camera attached to his torso			2
but the official stressed that no evidence has emerged in saturday 's attack in pointing to any link to @entity110 terrorism			0
the official said the killer shot the @entity28 couple first in the museum entryway with one of his weapons			1
the couple had been consulting the wall display			0
he then pulled out a @entity63 assault rifle and shot the others inside the museum			0
surveillance cameras picked up the killer walking on two or three streets before he disappeared			0
the official said the killer appeared to be skilled in using weapons and likely planned the attack meticulously			0
the official stressed @entity2 authorities are investigating all possible angles , including @entity110 terrorism , neo-nazi attack , and other categories			1
with regard to the threat from @entity110 terrorism , he noted there has been longstanding concern over the 100 or so @entity2 @entity110 extremists who received training in the @entity163 - @entity115 region over the years , and high current concern over several hundred who have more recently traveled to fight in @entity167			0
the concern is they might be able to use skills acquired there to launch attacks back home			0
@entity2 's @entity174 raised its terror alert level in the wake of the attack			2
@entity0 's @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			0
