@entity0 , @entity1 -- the impact of the oil spill in the @entity5 is starting to be made vivid by the steady flow of still images and video that capture this catastrophe			1
for example , @entity10 , the grandson of capt. @entity11 , dove into the oil spill , wearing protective gear			1
he captured horrifying video images of what has been taking place beneath the sea			0
a debate is already unfolding about whether president @entity20 has been effective in his response			1
is this @entity20 's @entity22 , as some commentators have asked ? the president has come under fire , primarily from @entity26 , but also from a growing number of environmental advocates , for being too slow to act			1
recent news reports have revealed the @entity20 administration has been as negligent in its oversight of drilling as the previous administration			1
the debate over president @entity20 's performance will continue , and his success or failure at stopping the gusher will determine how much damage this disaster inflicts on his presidency			1
but there is another , more significant , question that @entity45 and @entity26 in @entity46 must address -- and that is the policy origins of this disaster			0
indeed , one of the most important aspects of @entity22 was not simply how president @entity52 did or did not handle the aftermath of the hurricane , but rather , how @entity56 politicians in both parties had allowed a once - vibrant city to decay so dramatically over the past decades			1
many @entity56 were shocked to see the kind of devastating poverty in which so many @entity62 residents lived			0
with the @entity65 spill , the question revolves around deregulation			2
as with the financial meltdown in the fall 2008 , the oil spill highlights the cost of weakening regulations -- in this case , those rules that had been adopted to safeguard the environment			1
for over four decades , some conservatives and centrist democrats have waged war on the environmental infrastructure that was put into place during the 1960s and 1970s ( including under @entity26 president @entity80 )			2
at first , president @entity81 hoped to directly overturn as many environmental regulations as possible			2
he appointed @entity83 as secretary of interior and @entity85 as the head of the @entity87 , both of whom opposed many aspects of the environmental movement			0
yet @entity81 's efforts to eliminate the regulatory apparatus largely failed			2
he ran up against an environmental movement that was far more powerful than he expected			0
his efforts against the regulations in fact stimulated the movement to become even more active			0
the next strategy for his administration was to start weakening oversight , using administrative decisions to protect industry and undermine the quality of the agencies responsible for these programs			1
@entity83 and @entity85 , for example , did n't fight against proposed budget cuts that would clearly strain the capacity of their employees and accepted cost - benefit analyses that favored industry			0
@entity85 boasted that under her leadership , the @entity87 reduced the size of the clean water regulations manual from six inches to half an inch the @entity87 did n't make sure that companies were complying with regulations such as requirements to use modern pollution control equipment			1
this pattern continued under president @entity52			1
as the contributors of my forthcoming book , " the @entity127 : the @entity128 ( @entity129 ) " have argued , @entity52 administration officials frequently rejected scientific expertise when making decisions and staffed bureaucratic positions with people who were not sympathetic to the goals of their own organization			1
the @entity137 is a poster child for the effects of these policies			0
this mms , which had the responsibility of monitoring these oil rigs , has been rendered ineffective			0
engineers have dominated decision - making over the scientists			0
when some @entity56 policymakers were insisting on the use of a better shut - off mechanism a few years ago , the @entity137 , convinced by the complaints of the oil industry , rejected their proposals			1
congressional hearings recently revealed that the agency let industry officials complete their own inspection forms			0
they also accepted gifts from the companies they were supposed to be monitoring			0
though he ran on a campaign of change , president @entity20 's administration has essentially allowed this deregulatory strategy to continue			1
not long before the spill , @entity20 had announced his support for an expansion of offshore drilling			1
according to the @entity169 , that announcement caught even oil industry officials by surprise			1
they were expecting new restrictions , and after the spill , the @entity169 reported , the government continued to give environmental waivers to @entity5 oil drilling projects			1
even worse , it has done so for projects using the same kind of techniques that were used by @entity65 in the @entity5			2
secretary of interior @entity181 has come under fire as well for suggesting that his agency did not envision any major change in oil and gas production			0
even some @entity26 are slowly rethinking the consequences of deregulation in this area			0
@entity194 gov. @entity193 , desperate for the help of the government that he has so often derided , has complained that the president has not done enough			0
@entity193 's spokesman said that " while @entity65 is the responsible party , the federal government needs to ensure that they are indeed held accountable and responsible ... " june 11 would have been @entity11 's 100th birthday			0
certainly @entity11 would be weeping if he could see the kind of damage that is being caused by the spill			0
president @entity20 must not only stop this immediate leak , but must be certain to fix the policies that allowed this kind of risky drilling to take place			2
this does not just entail putting new rules on the books but also making sure they will be enforced			2
only then can the government diminish the risk of this happening again			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity215 .			2

for decades , some have argued for deregulating industries such as the oil industry
@entity221 says **lax** regulations helped set the stage for the *massive* @entity5 oil spill
he says @entity20 administration had largely followed @entity52 administration in **lax** regulation
@entity215 : government needs to impose new rules and make sure they are enforced
