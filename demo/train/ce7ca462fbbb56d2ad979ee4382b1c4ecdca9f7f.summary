a week after a powerful 7.0 tremor ripped through @entity2 in january 2010 , time was running out for @entity3			2
the 64 - year - old woman was trapped , without food and water , eight meters under the rubble of @entity9 's ruined cathedral			0
a team of rescuers from @entity12 worked against the clock to rescue her , with the stench of decomposing bodies in their nostrils			0
after two - and - a - half hours , the rescuers from the @entity18 managed to pull @entity3 out of the debris of the once - imposing building			0
the @entity12 team , working alongside a @entity23 group , made headlines around the world and became front - page news back home			1
@entity28 , who founded @entity18 , says the rescue mission marked the first time rescuers from an @entity12 country pulled someone out of earthquake rubble alive in another part of the world			1
" we achieved a world first for the @entity12 continent , " he says			0
@entity41 added that the rescue is proof of his continent 's ability to make a positive contribution to the rest of the world			1
" @entity12 is always viewed as people receiving aid , here @entity12 went across another part of the world and saved somebody in another land , how much greater can it be ? " he says proudly			1
" that was an achievement for @entity12 : this time , we are not asking , this time we are saying , ' we are going to give , ' that is a step in the right direction , " the @entity12 doctor - turned - aid worker adds			0
but , it was n't the first time @entity41 's organization made a big difference in disaster - hit areas outside @entity12			1
launched in 1992 , @entity41 's @entity18 has so far delivered aid to 32 countries -- from deploying the world 's first containerized mobile hospital in war - torn @entity68 and delivering food and water in flood - hit @entity72 , to helping @entity73 tackle its cholera outbreak and saving lives in @entity2			1
it is now the largest disaster relief group of @entity12 origin			1
@entity41 's foundation has been providing life - saving aid for almost two decades now and he says it has been shattering stereotypes about @entity12 along the way			1
" when i was in @entity72 in 2005 and some other countries were getting together for the earthquake , and when we came they got confused and they said , ' who are you people ? ' " recalls @entity41			1
" ' i said we 're from @entity12 , ' ' oh , you 're from @entity12 , did you come to ask something here ? ' i said ' no , i did n't come to ask something , i brought something , ' " he adds			0
more recently , @entity41 's group was among the first to respond to the devastating famine in @entity94			1
@entity18 say they have flown 180 tons of emergency aid from @entity12 to the east @entity12 country 's capital , @entity98 and delivered a further 2,000 tons by sea			1
@entity41 , a household name in @entity12 , credits the media for encouraging his compatriots to give generously			2
" @entity12 sent a very strong statement : they said we are @entity12 and @entity94 is @entity12 and we 're going to respond to our brothers and sisters in @entity12 -- even to the point people told me that poor people in @entity12 refuse to receive donations that they normally receive			2
" they said ' give these donations to the people of @entity94 , they need it more than we need it			0
' it was an amazing spirit , in @entity12 we call it @entity119 : the spirit of sharing , of goodwill , of compassion , " he says			0
@entity41 has personally traveled twice to famine - ravaged @entity94 to deliver , not only food , but also medical expertise and equipment			2
in what is the group 's biggest project ever , @entity18 doctors have also treated thousands of people and performed surgical operations			0
in recognition of his humanitarian work , @entity28 has been presented with numerous accolades over for the years by several governments and organizations across the world , including the @entity140 civic commendation award in 1997 from @entity141			2
the celebrated philanthropist says he often invites the media to join him in his missions to make his group 's operation transparent and to be accountable for what he is given by @entity12			2
" i tell the media , ' come -- no restriction , no telling you what to say , speak or write , you report what you see , what you observe and what you perceive , ' and they 've been traveling with us for many missions			0
" @entity41 says his aid agency , which has three warehouses in @entity12 packed with supplies , would be able to feed tens of thousands of people if a disaster struck now			1
a tireless worker , he is always ready to give his time to respond to the world 's next crisis			0
" you can not turn a blind eye and say ' i ca n't do it , i do n't want to do it because i 'm tired , ' because one day somebody may be too tired to help you , how will that feel ? "			0
