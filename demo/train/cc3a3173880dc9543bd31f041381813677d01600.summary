@entity0 is requesting the @entity2 @entity1 investigate the conduct of employee @entity4 , alleging she violated the ethics code for government employees			1
@entity7 is an @entity8 ( @entity8 ) agent who investigated @entity0 for safety violations after the death of @entity13 , a veteran trainer killed by a 12,000 - pound orca named @entity15 in 2010			1
as a result of some of @entity7 's findings , @entity8 determined @entity0 violated the @entity19 , saying it exposed its workers to a " known hazard " in the workplace			1
@entity8 fined @entity0 and restricted the interaction between trainers in the water with the killer whales , a decision that @entity0 has appealed			1
in a 228 - page complaint filed thursday , @entity0 said it has obtained information showing @entity7 is biased against the aquatic park and accused her of engaging in cronyism with the producers of the documentary , " @entity37 , " produced by @entity35 and acquired by @entity36 last year			1
the film explores the concept of keeping killer whales in captivity for entertainment			0
it set off a national debate resulting in significant backlash for @entity0			2
@entity0 has long called " @entity37 " one - sided and claimed it is the product of animal activists			1
a spokesman for the @entity1 's inspector general said the office had received the complaint but could issue no further comment			0
attempts to reach @entity7 were not immediately successful friday			2
@entity1 spokesman @entity54 said @entity8 referred the matter to the inspector general in january , immediately after allegations first surfaced , and that the agency is awaiting the results of that investigation			1
in the complaint , @entity0 alleges @entity7 attended the @entity62 with " @entity37 " producers and accepted lodging free of charge			1
@entity0 provided @entity36 with several purported photos of @entity7 , lifted from what appear to be her personal social media accounts , showing the federal employee in various photos with the film 's cast and crew -- including a picture of the group in a " @entity81 " pose , complete with air guns , at the film 's premiere in @entity80			1
the company also accused @entity7 of disclosing confidential information			2
" @entity37 " associate producer @entity85 asked to borrow a witness ' thumb drive and was subsequently seen working with @entity7 on a laptop computer , the complaint says			1
the witness then found new documents related to @entity8 's investigation on the drive after it was returned -- documents , the complaint states were clearly labeled as @entity0 trade secrets			1
the complaint does not identify the witness			0
@entity85 told @entity36 no confidential documents were shared with him			0
" i have no idea what to make of these accusations , " he said			0
" @entity4 never shared documents with ' @entity37			1
' there are no documents in the film			0
" what 's more , @entity7 was not invited to sundance by the " @entity37 " crew , @entity85 said			2
she stayed in the house where the crew stayed for a few nights due to a lodging shortage in the area , but she " came on her own dime , " he said			0
" ' @entity37 ' does not have any , did not use any confidential documents , " @entity85 said			0
" we obviously knew who she was			0
we tried to interview her , but ... all of @entity8 declined to participate			0
" he added , " any feelings she had on @entity0 , it was on her own			0
" government employees are prohibited from divulging trade secrets			2
they face imprisonment , fines or termination if found in violation			0
" we believe that this conduct demonstrates that she was influenced by improper considerations , and failed to bring the appropriate objectivity , in the investigation of the death of whale trainer @entity13 , " the complaint states			0
" @entity0 further believes that ms. @entity4 's disclosure of confidential information and other conduct reflect an intense bias and a desire to assist those in the animal rights community who have publicly , and for many years , demonstrated a desire to damage @entity0 as a viable business			2
