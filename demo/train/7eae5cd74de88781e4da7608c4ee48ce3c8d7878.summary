as a teenager , @entity0 danced in music videos and was a regular kid hanging out with friends in @entity5 , @entity6			1
but within a year , he went from a hip - hop - loving teenager to a young muslim convert , preaching on the streets of @entity5			2
his father , @entity10 , claims that in 2010 , when @entity0 was 15 , he became infatuated with a @entity12 girl , which eventually led to him converting to @entity14			1
his parents started noticing a radical change in their son about eight to nine months after the conversion			2
" he started to become very religious			0
he stopped wearing his normal clothes			0
so we really see the progress of radicalization -- this is the right word -- we really see the signs , " @entity10 explained			2
@entity10 says he called the authorities after his son joined a radical @entity8 organization in @entity6 , but they took no action			1
" [ they told me ] there is no law forbidding a child to be a member of this organization , " @entity10 says			2
" it 's freedom of speech			2
" when @entity0 , still a teenager , asked his parents if he could move to @entity40 to study @entity14 last year , they said yes			0
but @entity10 knew something was wrong when @entity0 did n't call his sister on her birthday -- and he began to believe that his son was n't in @entity44 at all			1
@entity10 searched for clues online to where his son really was , and he was shocked by what he found -- videos and pictures of his son 's hometown friends in @entity51			1
" it was @entity51 this , @entity51 that			2
one day i find a video ... of friends of his from @entity5			0
so when i saw that , i knew right away -- my son is there , " he says			0
so @entity10 , a former @entity6 soldier who says he used to work with the @entity59 , decided to go after @entity0 himself			1
he took out an ad in a local newspaper asking for volunteers to take him to @entity51			2
in april of last year , a @entity64 war reporter agreed to accompany @entity10 to @entity51 , but their trip turned up few leads on where @entity0 might be			1
so six months later , @entity10 returned to the war - torn country on his own			2
@entity10 says it did n't take long before he encountered some of the militants who were fighting to bring down the regime of @entity51 president @entity74			1
@entity10 says he was warned that he would be killed by the @entity14 , but instead they took him in			1
along the way , @entity75 shot videos of his time in @entity51			2
in one he appears to sympathize with the militants , even parading around with their weapons			0
" they took me in and they all respect me , " he says			0
" i was eating with leaders ( of these groups ) and they pray for me			0
" " i have been in @entity51 and i meet with so many groups like @entity86 ... and i am not @entity8			1
and when you see what these people have done for me ! they arranged for my sleeping and food			0
" @entity86 , a hard - line @entity92 affiliate , is one of the most notorious groups operating in @entity51 today			1
@entity10 says militants from the group nearly beat him to death			1
" they beat me , they almost killed me , " he says			0
" they took all my clothes off			0
they put a cap on me , they put cuffs on me			0
and i was almost dead , because always they suspect [ i was ] @entity108 , " he says			0
but in the end , @entity10 says , they let him go -- and led him to his son , who he says was living with @entity86 militants at the time			1
@entity10 gets emotional when describing what it was like to come face to face with his son for the first time inside @entity51			1
" i never cried before when i was searching for him , when i did n't know anything , " he says			0
" but the first physical contact -- i held him like a small baby			0
i was really in harmony with him			0
because he was like a children who has lost his way			0
" but the saga did n't end when @entity10 and his son boarded the plane home			1
police detained @entity0 , now 19 , when they landed in @entity6 , and charged him with participating in a terrorist organization			1
@entity0 says he was only there to deliver medical supplies to the group			0
@entity0 is now at home with his dad , but he is being closely monitored by @entity6 authorities as he awaits his trial , which is expected to begin at the end of june			2
he is barred from speaking to the press			0
@entity10 insists his son is innocent and says that the @entity6 authorities have n't done enough to keep their own citizens safe from extremist groups			1
what was @entity0 's role inside @entity51 ? was he truly on a humanitarian mission ? there are more questions than answers as @entity0 's day in court approaches -- but for both father and son , the journey has transformed their lives forever .			1

@entity160 left @entity6 to join militant group @entity86 in @entity51 last year
@entity10 's dad @entity10 decided to try to track his son down in @entity51
@entity86 militants nearly killed @entity10 , but *ultimately* led him to his son
@entity160 , now 19 , is back in @entity6 and facing terrorism charges
