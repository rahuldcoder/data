on @entity3 's " @entity2 , " host and chief national correspondent @entity0 goes outside the @entity4 to report on the issues affecting communities across the country			1
this week , @entity0 traveled to @entity8 looking at the health of the @entity10			1
the crab population in the @entity10 is no longer as abundant as it once was			1
@entity12 , @entity8 ( @entity3 ) -- it is just after first light , and @entity15 gently eases the @entity16 off the pier at @entity12 harbor			1
" you 're sure you want to do this ? " he asks a visitor with a whimsical smile			0
it is the last time the word " gently " will come to mind this day			0
his closest crab pot is nearly five miles out into @entity10 , and the bouncing -- and rocking -- starts just seconds after passing the mouth of the protected harbor			1
the @entity30 - @entity16 -- named after @entity15 's two children -- @entity32 and @entity33 -- is the only boat braving the rough waters on this morning			1
on a scale of 1 to 10 -- with 10 being as rough as he dare venture out in --- @entity15 scores this morning " about a 9Â½			1
" @entity15 has been working these waters since he was a teenager			1
forty - eight years now --- already eight years ' experience under his belt when the world marked the first @entity43 in april 1970			1
this year is the 40th anniversary , and @entity15 is downbeat when assessing the health of the environmental treasure he loves --- and on which he depends for his livelihood			1
" too much phosphorous , too much fertilizer , too much untreated waste , " @entity15 says			1
where does it come from ? " @entity54 that live in the @entity10 watershed mainly			1
we the people , " he says			0
" @entity61 " has been the region 's environmental cause for decades now			2
@entity15 is both a believer and a skeptic			1
" where is that money going ? i mean , you know there is lots of money being donated to help her , but she 's still going downhill			2
you know , if we were to get a catastrophic storm like a @entity74 , she might never recover			0
you know , that 's how bad she is			2
" the swells exceed 7 feet as we make our way to harvest the pots , and at times the winds and the waves combine to toss the boat like a toy			0
the bags of razor clams on the deck are bait this time of year --- a few scoops added to each of the pots pulled from the floor of the still - frigid bay waters			2
after pulling five pots , @entity15 has all the evidence he needs to know the cold rains of the previous day have the crabs dormant			1
" you and i wear sweatshirts and hunker down , " he says in the ship 's cabin --- messy because the waves have already dumped the pans off the small stove and sent other small equipment and supplies flying			2
" when it is this cold down there , they hibernate			0
" @entity15 lives and works most of the year in the northern @entity10			1
but he is here near its southern tip because it gets warmer here a bit earlier , and the warmer the water , the more feisty --- and active --- are the blue crabs for which the bay is famous			2
@entity15 loves his work -- and is good at it			1
with just one crew member this day --- in part because he knew the weather meant a relatively short day and in part to leave enough room for a @entity3 crew --- @entity15 leaves the cabin to help harvest the crabs			1
he spots his buoys and uses a hook to find the rope and wrap it into the winch			0
@entity131 grabs each mesh pot as the winch pulls it out of the water , and methodically packs in more bait , shakes out the crabs into a box on deck , sorts the males from the females , tosses those too small to keep back into the bay and then drops the pot for its journey back to the bottom			2
tough work in extreme elements , magnified this day by rough seas that repeatedly send water over the side and the stern onto the deck			0
after just a little more than a bushel , @entity15 decides it is best to call it a day			1
we have been out in the bay for about two hours and have not seen another boat			2
today , it is the combination of bad weather and the early season			0
but @entity15 takes the longer view , remembering when he left his early work on the docks for work on the waters			1
" when i started in the late ' 60s , there was commercial rock fishing , there was clamming , there was oystering , crabbing , " he says			0
" twenty years ago , you had striped bass and you had oysters , clamming			2
" most of that is gone , @entity15 says , and for all the commitment to " @entity61 " he is of the view little progress has been made , and that development on the shoreline , population growth in the area and runoff from area farms and lawns have greatly outpaced conservation and restoration efforts			1
" it is going to take a long while , " @entity15 says			1
" it took 100 years to get this way ; it is going to take sizable amounts of years to bring her back			2
" those who watch the bay share his assessment			2
the annual report by the @entity199 gave the bay a score of 28 on a scale of 100			2
or , on a school grading system , a " d " --- the same grade as in 2007			0
a 70 score would mean restoration of its health and habitats ; a 100 would mean a pristine bay with no water quality or fishery health issues			1
@entity215 , a bay foundation scientist and onetime waterman , says by appearances alone , the southern portions of the bay are doing better			2
" this is a pretty , relatively clean area , " @entity215 says during a waterside stroll in @entity220			0
" but overall there is still a lot of problems with the bay from runoff , from ... sewage from sewage treatment plants , agricultural runoff			2
the bay is slowly improving but not at a fast enough rate , especially considering that we have been working at this for several decades now , actually 30 or 40 years			1
so i would say that the bay is not winning			0
" @entity15 sees the algae blooms and grasses cited in the report as he travels a 190 - mile stretch over the spring , summer and fall			1
and he sees a way of life struggling to survive			0
" there used to be 60 to 70 boats out of my little town , " he says			0
" now there are 20			0
my grandsons will not be watermen			0
i have got a son that is a waterman and has to work damn hard to be that waterman			0
so grandsons want to go , but they are not going			0
" it 's very hard on relationships also			0
you know , that 's a tough thing			0
are you going to pay the mortgage , or are you going to stay home and get so far in debt that you might lose everything that you have got , you know , to the bank ? and the banks do n't want these boats , you know , but they want to see you make it			0
but it is a very tough way of life now			0
" he breaks down the job 's tough math -- grateful , mind you , that fuel is about $ 2 a gallon this spring --- half of what it was last year			0
" if you come in with say 25 bushels of crabs , that makes you , say , $ 1,000			0
it still costs you $ 400 to $ 500 a day to untie her to go			0
if you got help , you have those expenditures			0
and if you do n't have good production , and low prices , there is no profit			0
" and if @entity15 could do one thing ? " just give the @entity10 back her 1970 water quality , and we will have plenty of crabs , and plenty of oysters , and plenty of rockfish , and we will have a good style of life again , you know			1
if we could get our regulators to work that out ... to improve our water quality --- the @entity10 could heal herself			1
but she 's , she 's dying daily			1

efforts are under way to save the @entity10 's economy , environment
@entity313 has been working the bay for *48* years
@entity317 development has outpaced conservation , restoration efforts , @entity15 says
" she 's dying daily , " he says of @entity10
