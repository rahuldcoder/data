@entity0 -- inside the marble walls at the @entity3 , the last days of june are called the " flood season , " a frantic push to finish its work for the summer			2
the stakes are especially high this term , with rulings on two major issues left to be announced			1
what the justices decide in the next week or so could fundamentally change lives and legacies on a range of politically explosive issues			1
on monday , the court sidestepped a sweeping decision on the use of race - conscious school admission policies , ruling on the criteria at the @entity24 and whether they violate the equal protection rights of some white applicants			1
the justices threw the case back to the lower courts for further review			1
that leaves two high - profile issues with rulings still to be announced : -- same - sex marriage : a pair of appeals testing whether gays and lesbian couples have a fundamental constitutional right to wed. -- voting rights : the future of the @entity42 , and continued federal oversight of elections in states with a past history of discrimination			1
" it 's almost unimaginable the number of things that the @entity3 is going to decide that will affect all @entity55 , " said @entity48 , a top @entity0 attorney and publisher of @entity50			2
" what would surprise me this term is if the court upheld ... the ( enforcement tool behind the ) @entity42			1
and i think it would be a big surprise if the court did anything radical when it came to same - sex marriage -- either saying there was a constitutional right to it , or rejecting that claim outright and forever			1
i think that 's something they 're going to try and tread that middle ground path			2
" the court will not say precisely when these hot - button opinions will be released , but it could wrap its work by thursday			1
depending on how long it takes the justices to finish up , that internal deadline might slide into early july			1
veterans of forgotten voting war count the cost oral arguments have ended for the term , and the justices have already secretly voted on the pending cases			1
individual justices have been assigned to write one or more opinions , as well as separate dissents			1
only they and their law clerks know how this will end			2
and no one is talking -- continuing an unbroken tradition of discretion rare in leak - loving @entity0			1
" at the @entity3 , those who know , do n't talk			2
and those who talk , do n't know , " justice @entity96 has said , echoing similar comments from her colleagues			2
the high court holds fast to an unofficial but self - imposed deadline to have all draft opinions finished by june 1			1
they are circulated to colleagues , and subsequent dissents and concurrences must be submitted by june 15			0
nothing is final until the decision is released to the public			0
votes can and do change at the last minute			0
justices and their law clerks are holed up in chambers , working overtime to frame and craft the final opinions , making sure every fact , every footnote , every legal theory is fully checked and articulated			1
the nine members know they are writing their legacies with these issues			1
the outcome may be disputed , but the constitutional reasoning -- at least in the justices ' own minds -- must be sound			1
" getting themselves organized , identifying the different majorities , getting opinions written and circulated in dissents and concurrencies will really test their capabilities in the final days , " @entity48 said			0
the opinion - writing exercise is little - known , and the court likes it that way			1
predicting the outcome is a time - honored @entity0 parlor game , but rarely consistently successful			1
there has been particularly intense focus on the same - sex marriage cases			1
thousands of activists rallied at the court when the case was argued in march			0
fast facts : top @entity55 @entity3 decisions at issue : -- federal benefits			0
the @entity146 , or @entity146 , is a 1996 law saying that , for federal purposes , marriage is defined as only between one man and one woman			1
that means federal tax , @entity154 , pension , and bankruptcy benefits , family medical leave protections -- and a thousand more such provisions -- do not apply to gay and lesbian couples			0
@entity161 , an 84 - year - old @entity163 woman , is the key plaintiff in the @entity146 fight			2
she was forced to pay more than $ 363,000 in extra estate taxes after the death of her longtime spouse , @entity161			0
the @entity171 high court had earlier concluded same - sex marriage is legal , but the 2008 voter - approved @entity173 abolished it			1
the @entity55 @entity3 is being asked to establish same - sex marriage as a constitutional right , but it could instead decide a more narrow question : whether a state , through referendum , can revoke that right once it has been recognized			1
the political , social , and legal stakes of this long - simmering debate will once again put the high court at the center of national attention , as it was in last summer 's ruling upholding most of the massive health care reform law championed by president @entity185			2
nine states now allow gays and lesbians to legally wed : @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity163 , @entity195 , and @entity0 , as well as the @entity0			0
@entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198 recently passed laws that take effect this summer			0
it is estimated about 120,000 legally married gay and lesbian couples live in the @entity55			0
opinion : bring voting into the digital age there is division within the ranks of both sides about whether the court will -- and should -- issue a sweeping ruling on the constitutional " equal protection " question			0
some activists and politicians -- even some justices themselves -- think the elected branches may be in a better position to drive the same - sex marriage issue , not the courts			1
voters in three states last november approved same - sex marriage , marking the first time the ballot was used to approve such unions			1
@entity171 is the only state to allow and then revoke same - sex marriage			1
" this is a conservative court -- conservative ideologically and conservative in the sense that they like to take baby steps , and it seems very unlikely that they would make some big radical move requiring all states to recognize same - sex marriages , " @entity48 said			1
" they are much more likely to do something a little more modest			0
the other thing about them is that they do n't want to be on the wrong side of history			0
it seems pretty clear where this is going , with a much broader recognition of same - sex marriage , and so the justices do n't want to call that into question when the country is headed in that direction			1
" in fact , the court has set itself up to " punt " on both @entity173 and @entity146 , avoiding for now consideration of the constitutional questions			0
such a " legal letdown " could turn on " standing , " or the legal authority or eligibility of those involved in the lawsuit to argue the case			0
@entity171 's governor has refused to defend proposition 8 in court , leaving a coalition of private groups to step in			0
can they satisfy court scrutiny by establishing they would suffer tangible harm if the lower court ruling stands ? the justices could also " @entity278 " it , that is , have the case " dismissed as improvidently granted			2
" basically , the justices would be saying they should not have taken the @entity173 appeal in the first place			2
justice @entity282 at the march oral argument suggested as much : " if the issue is letting the states experiment and letting the society have more time to figure out its direction , why is taking a case now the answer ? " some of her conservative colleagues seemed to agree as well			0
the difference between rejecting the case on standing or @entity278 grounds would be important			0
a @entity278 would be likely to mean lower court rulings striking down @entity173 would hold , allowing @entity171 gay and lesbian couples to marry if they chose			2
how quickly that would happen is unclear because further legal challenges could be filed			0
but a " standing " ruling would likely nullify everything , perhaps forcing both sides to start all over again in the lower courts , and limiting the reach of gay marriage to perhaps only a few @entity171 counties			2
another statewide referendum , likely to be held next year , could finally settle the matter			0
recent polls show growing support for same - sex marriage in @entity171 , reflecting a trend nationwide			1
scenarios , terminology key in prepping for same - sex court ruling @entity146 has its own sticky procedural questions			1
@entity185 now supports gay marriage , and has refused to defend the 1996 federal law			2
that has left @entity319 as the official parties in support of @entity146			0
so the court could also dismiss that case on standing grounds			0
most legal analysts , however , expect a more substantive ruling , one based on @entity146 's merits			0
picking winners and losers at this stage is a subjective , even partisan , exercise			0
the court itself will be both cheered and vilified however it rules			0
but as an institution , it has survived similar crises of confidence over its discretionary authority in rulings involving slavery , racial integration , corporate power , abortion -- even @entity344			2
reaction to these big cases will be swift and furious from the professional punditry and halls of government			2
some individual @entity55 stand to gain from the decisions , while others could be hurt financially and emotionally			0
all of this is entrusted in the hands of nine judges			0
the @entity3 usually gets the last word in these matters , regardless of who disagrees with the decisions			0
justice @entity358 , on the court from 1941 to 1954 , put it this way : " we are not final because we are infallible , but we are infallible only because we are final			0

rulings on two major issues are among those remaining to be announced
the cases *include* a pair of appeals testing the right to same - sex marriage
two other cases involve the future of the @entity42 and oversight of some elections
the justices have already secretly voted on the pending cases
