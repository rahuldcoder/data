-- since the dawn of time , people have found nifty ways to clean up after the bathroom act			1
the most common solution was simply to grab what was at hand : coconuts , shells , snow , moss , hay , leaves , grass , corncobs , sheep 's wool -- and , later , thanks to the printing press -- newspapers , magazines , and pages of books			2
the average @entity25 uses 57 squares a day and 50 pounds of toilet paper per year			1
the ancient @entity28 used clay and stone ; the @entity31 , sponges and salt water			1
but the idea of a commercial product designed solely to wipe one 's bum ? that started about 150 years ago , right here in the @entity25 in less than a century , @entity41 's marketing genius turned something disposable into something indispensable			2
toilet paper gets on a roll the first products designed specifically to wipe one 's nethers were aloe - infused sheets of manila hemp dispensed from @entity52 - like boxes			1
they were invented in 1857 by a @entity55 entrepreneur named @entity56 , who claimed his sheets prevented hemorrhoids			2
@entity56 was so proud of his therapeutic bathroom paper that he had his name printed on each sheet			0
but his success was limited			0
@entity25 soon grew accustomed to wiping with the @entity64 catalog , and they saw no need to spend money on something that came in the mail for free			2
toilet paper took its next leap forward in 1890 , when two brothers named @entity72 and @entity73 popularized the concept of toilet paper on a roll			1
the @entity78 ' brand became more successful than @entity56 's medicated wipes , in part because they built a steady trade selling toilet paper to hotels and drugstores			1
but it was still an uphill battle to get the public to openly buy the product , largely because @entity25 remained embarrassed by bodily functions			2
in fact , the @entity90 were so ashamed of the nature of their work that they did n't take proper credit for their innovation until 1902			0
" no one wanted to ask for it by name , " says @entity98 , author of " @entity99 : how @entity25 is shaped by its @entity103			2
" " it was so taboo that you could n't even talk about the product			0
" by 1930 , the @entity108 paper company @entity107 began using the tag line , " ask for a roll of @entity111 and you wo n't have to say toilet paper ! " as time passed , toilet tissues slowly became an @entity25 staple			1
but widespread acceptance of the product did n't officially occur until a new technology demanded it			0
at the end of the 19th century , more and more homes were being built with sit - down flush toilets tied to indoor plumbing systems			0
and because people required a product that could be flushed away with minimal damage to the pipes , corncobs and moss no longer cut it			0
in no time , toilet paper ads boasted that the product was recommended by both doctors and plumbers			1
@entity0 : 5 times drug companies promised too much strength of going soft in the early 1900s , toilet paper was still being marketed as a medicinal item			1
but in 1928 , the @entity139 tried a different tack			0
on the advice of its ad men , the company introduced a brand called @entity145 and fitted the product with a feminine logo that depicted a beautiful woman			0
the genius of the campaign was that by evincing softness and femininity , the company could avoid talking about toilet paper 's actual purpose			1
@entity145 was enormously successful , and the tactic helped the brand survive the @entity158			0
( it also helped that , in 1932 , @entity145 began marketing economy - size packs of four rolls			0
) decades later , the dainty ladies were replaced with babies and bear cubs -- advertising vehicles that still stock the aisles today			0
by the 1970s , @entity25 could no longer conceive of life without toilet paper			1
case in point : in december 1973 , @entity172 host @entity171 joked about a toilet paper shortage during his opening monologue			1
but @entity25 did n't laugh			2
instead , tv watchers across the country ran out to their local grocery stores and bought up as much of the stuff as they could			2
also telling was that , in 1978 , a tv guide poll named mr. @entity181 -- the affable grocer who implored customers , " please do n't squeeze the @entity145 " -- the third best - known man in @entity25 , behind former president @entity186 and the rev. @entity187			1
@entity0 : @entity188 and other bizarre brand extensions rolling the world currently , the @entity25 spends more than $ 6 billion a year on toilet tissue -- more than any other nation in the world			1
@entity25 , on average , use 57 squares a day and 50 pounds a year			2
even still , the toilet paper market in the @entity25 has largely plateaued			1
the real growth in the industry is happening in developing countries			0
there , it 's booming			0
toilet paper revenues in @entity201 alone have more than doubled since 2004			1
the radical upswing in sales is believed to be driven by a combination of changing demographics , social expectations , and disposable income			0
" the spread of globalization can kind of be measured by the spread of @entity212 bathroom practices , " says @entity98			0
when average citizens in a country start buying toilet paper , wealth and consumerism have arrived			1
it signifies that people not only have extra cash to spend , but they 've also come under the influence of @entity212 marketing			0
@entity25 without toilet paper ? even as the markets boom in developing nations , toilet paper manufacturers find themselves needing to charge more per roll to make a profit			1
that 's because production costs are rising			0
during the past few years , pulp has become more expensive , energy costs are rising , and even water is becoming scarce			0
as the climate continues to change , toilet paper companies may need to keep hiking up their prices			1
the question is , if toilet paper becomes a luxury item , can @entity25 live without it ? @entity0 : why does bottled water have an expiration date ? the truth is that we did live without it , for a very long time			1
and even now , a lot of people do			0
in @entity251 , the @entity247 -- a toilet that comes equipped with a bidet and an air - blower -- is growing increasingly popular			1
and all over the world , water remains one of the most common methods of self - cleaning			2
many places in @entity259 , the @entity260 , and @entity261 , for instance , still depend on a bucket and a spigot			0
but as our economy continues to circle the drain , will @entity25 part with their beloved toilet paper in order to adopt more money - saving measures ? or will we keep flushing our cash away ? @entity98 , for one , believes a toilet - paper apocalypse is hardly likely			1
after all , the @entity25 marketing machine is a powerful thing			2
