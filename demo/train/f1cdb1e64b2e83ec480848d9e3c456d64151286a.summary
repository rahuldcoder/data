-- i first heard @entity3 's name as i was walking into my college cafeteria early one evening in 1981			1
a somber radio voice announced the passing of @entity3 , the @entity7 who had been shot along with president @entity9 , not more than a couple of miles from campus			1
thankfully , the report turned out to be wrong			2
@entity3 survived his wounds that day , although he was left with slurred speech , partial paralysis and difficulty walking			1
it was not the first , nor the last time @entity3 's strength and resilience was underestimated			1
although i could not have predicted it at the time , it was not the last time i 'd hear about @entity3			1
@entity3 , former @entity9 press secretary , gun - control advocate , dies i 'd like to think @entity3 and i had a few things in common			1
we both worked our way up in the rough and tumble politics game			2
we both had a distant dream that someday we 'd get to work in the @entity7 briefing room			1
@entity3 found his guy with the former governor of @entity35			1
mine was the governor from @entity38			0
but i do n't look at @entity3 as a colleague or a fellow warrior who survived the verbal battle that is the @entity7 briefing room			1
@entity3 is , and always will be , something bigger , something that transcends politics and @entity45 celebrity			1
i remember speaking to a group of young students one day in the briefing room			1
one of the kids asked me who my hero was			0
i do n't think anyone had ever asked me that before			0
but it did n't take long for me to tell them the heroic story of @entity3			1
i explained that @entity3 had something terrible happen to him			2
he was just doing his job one day , a job he loved , when everything he knew about his life and the world was turned upside down			0
@entity62 , finish the job on @entity3 background checks with great strength and perseverance , @entity3 survived a gunshot wound to his head			2
but that 's not what made him great			0
what made him a hero was what he did with his life from that day forward			0
@entity3 had every right to be bitter			2
he 'd worked all his life to get to the pinnacle of his profession			0
and before even getting settled into his fancy @entity7 office , it was all taken away			2
his rehabilitation was beyond painful			0
that was nothing compared to the frustration of relearning the most basic things we all take for granted			0
while he did growl from time to time , the " @entity86 " was never bitter			0
his reaction was just the opposite			0
he turned his own pain and tragedy into a positive , working every day to make the world a little better , a little safer for all of us			0
@entity3 became the lead campaigner for gun control in our country			1
if you 've been watching this debate at all in @entity100 , you know there is nothing tougher politically than getting sensible gun safety measures through our toxic political system			2
many have talked about it , given speeches , run ads and used celebrity to highlight the issue			0
working with leaders like president @entity113 and sen. @entity114 , @entity3 -- and his not - so - secret - weapon wife @entity115 -- got it done			1
pure and simple , he accomplished the politically impossible			1
the man who made people talk about guns that is why in 2000 , late in the administration , president @entity113 decided to rename the briefing room in honor of @entity3			1
it was a small gesture , symbolic for most			0
but for the men and women who stand behind that podium it is very real			0
it reminds each of us that every time we step up to that microphone we should hold ourselves to the highest standard of all			0
the standard set by @entity3			2
join us on @entity139 / @entity138 .			0
