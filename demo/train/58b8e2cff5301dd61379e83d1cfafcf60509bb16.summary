@entity0 -- in five years time , all new homes built in the @entity3 will be required to be zero carbon , with no net carbon emissions over a year			1
@entity1 spoke to green house - builders and environmentalists to answer some burning questions about zero carbon homes			2
why do we need zero carbon homes ? some 26 % of @entity3 's carbon emissions come from homes , making it a significant area for reducing emissions overall , according to @entity3 @entity16 and @entity17			1
@entity18 , of the @entity19 , the agency set up by the @entity3 government to help achieve its target , said an average home built in 2006 emits 3.2 tons of carbon a year and a typical 100 - year - old home emits about six tons			1
by 2016 , all new homes will have zero carbon emissions over a year			1
this will be a minimum requirement for homes to gain planning permission			0
of course , most people will not be living in new houses , so existing homes will also need to be made more energy efficient , according to @entity36 , sustainable homes policy adviser for @entity17			1
the @entity3 aims to build somewhere in the region of 200,000 new homes a year , a drop in the ocean compared to more than 22 million existing homes			2
quiz : do you live a sustainable life ? what exactly does zero carbon mean ? zero carbon homes will have no net carbon emissions over the course of a year			1
energy use will be minimized by use of thermally efficient building materials and insulation			0
all the energy used to heat and light the home and run its appliances will need to be off - set using zero carbon technology such as wind turbines , solar panels and ground source heat pumps			0
when the target was originally set in 2006 , it was envisaged that all this renewable energy would be generated onsite , according to @entity18			0
however , following a report in 2008 , which took in views from industry and green groups , it was decided that to be realistic , the definition needed to be relaxed to allow contributions to off - site renewable energy schemes			0
this would allow house - builders to make payments into new community energy schemes to off - set the carbon emissions of their homes			1
the exact definition of these " allowable solutions " as the off - site schemes are known , is still being worked out			0
leader , of @entity17 , said : " we need to make sure these allowable solutions are truly additional , and not things that would have happened anyway			0
" the @entity3 has a @entity86 , where the highest level 6 is zero carbon			2
regulations will require homes to move gradually up the scale before 2016			1
how does the @entity3 's target compare with others worldwide ? @entity18 , of the @entity19 , said : " the target is without doubt the most challenging in the world			2
" many believe that while countries such as @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 have already produced more zero carbon homes than the @entity3 , nowhere else can rival its ambitious target for 2016			1
@entity103 , director of policy and communications at @entity106 , an industry body liaising with the government over green issues , said : " this country 's target is world - leading , not on what we have delivered so far , but in ambition			0
" @entity116 legislation is leading towards zero carbon building , but the @entity3 is ahead of the picture in having such an ambitious target			1
@entity98 and @entity120 have historically had better building standards and some countries have decided to tackle the commercial building stock first			2
" leader agreed : " there are pockets of sustainable developments such as @entity128 in @entity98 and @entity129 in @entity99 , but nowhere else has a far - reaching policy like this			1
" @entity116 legislation is heading toward zero carbon building by 2020			0
" however , @entity133 , an architect who founded @entity135 , based in the @entity3 and @entity100 , and has built between 300 and 500 zero carbon homes worldwide , said : " there 's very little demand in the @entity3 compared with @entity98 and @entity100 , who are both far more ambitious and innovative			1
" how many zero carbon homes have been built so far ? very few			2
in 2007 the @entity3 government announced tax relief on zero carbon homes and so far only about 25 homes have qualified , according to @entity103 , of the @entity3 @entity16			2
however , this tax relief was based on the definition that all off - set energy had to be produced onsite , a definition which has since been considered unrealistic			0
@entity103 added : " this is a future policy and standards are ramping up between now and 2016			0
there 's not a huge incentive to go out and do it now			0
" @entity133 , who founded @entity135 in 1998 , said : " despite what all the volume house builders are saying , it 's not difficult if you want to do it			0
we are just getting on with it			0
" he added : " in the @entity3 , we are doing small - scale privately funded developments , whereas in @entity100 we are being asked to design whole city extensions with thousands of homes			1

@entity3 regulations will require all new homes to have zero net carbon emissions by 2016
these are the most ambitious targets in the world , according to *experts*
@entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 have built more sustainable homes so far , say environmentalists
