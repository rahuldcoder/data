-- an emperor penguin that lost its way from @entity3 more than two months ago was released back into his native @entity5 waters sunday			1
" it 's an indescribable feeling to see a patient finally set free , " said dr. @entity7 , manager of veterinary science at @entity9 , where the bird has been recuperating since @entity11 discovered it in june on a beach north of the capital city			1
@entity7 said the penguin , nicknamed " @entity19 " after the 2006 animated movie about emperor penguins , needed " some gentle encouragement " to slide down a ramp off the research vessel that transported it back home			1
" but once he hit the water he spared no time in diving off away from the boat and all those ' aliens ' who have been looking after him for so long , " @entity7 said in a statement posted on the zoo 's website			0
it 's unclear why the penguin apparently swam more than 3,000 kilometers ( 1,864 miles ) from @entity3			1
@entity7 said in june that the bird might have gotten lost in a current , or perhaps its internal radar went awry			0
the bird was found " exhausted and hungry " on @entity40 beach on @entity11 's @entity41 this summer , according to the zoo			2
it underwent multiple stomach flushes and an endoscopy at the zoo to rid its stomach of sand it ingested while trying to adapt to the foreign environment			0
" in @entity3 , they normally eat ice to cool down and to hydrate , " @entity50 , a spokeswoman for the zoo , said in june			2
it 's possible the bird mistook or tried to substitute the sand for snow or ice , she said			0
the penguin left the zoo monday and spent the past six days on the research vessel in a specially designed crate stocked with ice			2
a satellite tracker and microchip will now allow fans of the bird to follow his adventures in @entity3 at @entity71 .			0
