last january after a fresh snowstorm , my 9 - year - old son asked me to help him build a snowman			0
i told him that i would be out to help shortly			0
a couple of minutes later he came running back yelling , " @entity7 , it 's melting ! " that got my attention			2
it was sub- 30 outside , so how could a snowman be melting ? i followed him as he ran down the hall to his bedroom			0
in the middle of his room was a 4 - foot tall snowman , melting away			0
while i removed the snowman and cleaned the remaining slush and mud , i asked him why he did it			0
he said , in a very matter - of - fact - tone , " it 's cold outside			2
" growing up autistic my son has @entity27 's syndrome			1
for him , building a snowman in his bedroom because it was cold outside was a logical solution to a problem			0
because of my son , " aspies " hold a special place in my heart			2
so whenever i hear someone in my industry talk about hiring an @entity27 , i cringe just a little			1
because in technology , saying you 've hired an @entity27 is like code to say that you 've hired a machine			1
it 's true that there are a lot of benefits in hiring someone with @entity27 's			1
research from @entity46 shows the strengths of people with @entity27 's and high - functioning autism make them especially well - suited for software development and testing			1
they have the ability to focus for extended periods			0
they have very good memories and are often highly intelligent			0
their strong analytical skills make them talented at technology work			0
i have @entity27 's : i am just like you but there is a lot more to @entity27 than their focus , intelligence and determination			1
like anyone else , they have their highs and lows , and their good and bad days			0
as a manager , you should understand how to handle the unique opportunities and challenges that come with hiring an @entity27			1
here are six things you should know : 1			0
@entity27 are autistic @entity27 's syndrome is a high - functioning variant of autism			1
people with @entity27 's are often exceptionally intelligent and verbally gifted , but they also can be socially awkward			1
they can react to stress differently and at times more emotionally than others not on the autism spectrum			0
many people with @entity27 's are challenged by large crowds , looking people in the eye and reading common social cues			1
when talking with an @entity27 , do n't get offended if they look around or focus on an object in the room instead of looking directly at you			1
this is a coping skill that most aspies develop over time			2
listen to their words instead of focusing on their body language			0
aspies are intelligent -- and independent aspies will question authority			2
they will never accept " no " for an answer without being told the reason for it			0
they almost never accept a fact simply because of who it comes from			0
they will only accept it as fact if the logic proves out			0
for this reason , many inexperienced managers shy away from working with an @entity27			1
you just need to be prepared to justify your decisions when they 'll have a direct impact on your @entity27 employee			1
@entity27 think differently aspies frequently talk at length about small details instead of being brief and to the point			1
the reason is simple : it 's how they see the world			1
they hold complex mental models that include all those small interlocking details			0
to them , overlooking the details is ignoring part of the solution			0
it 's an @entity27 's way of getting it			1
i have seen @entity27 start reprogramming software in their head well before they get back to their desks and write the first line of code			1
aspie testers will instantly see what is wrong with the software because it no longer fits their model			0
all this " rewiring " has wonderfully positive results			0
@entity27 feel deeply it 's easy to think that @entity27 are less empathetic because of how they can act			1
when people are unsure how to respond to a stressful or unfamiliar situation , we can act in strange ways			2
this goes for @entity27 , too			1
one the most challenging things for any autistic individual to deal with is the cacophony of emotions that can be triggered by seemingly mundane events			0
for example , the cancellation of a project may be a relief to most of your team , while an @entity27 may see it as people not appreciating their hard work or allowing them to finish the job			1
pull them aside beforehand to explain the situation and ask them for their feedback and insight			0
it will give them a chance to process the idea			0
@entity27 talk differently in the most simple of terms : @entity27 are blunt to a fault			2
aspies are known for being direct , speaking their mind and being honest and determined			2
just be aware that an @entity27 is interested primarily in significant contributions to conversation , preferring to avoid " small talk , " trivial statements and superficial conversation			2
aspies are not trying to be rude			2
@entity27 are successful there is good reason that @entity27 's is called the successful disorder			1
their focus and dedication leads many aspies to great heights			0
i doubt you could find an entrepreneur who does n't have a few @entity27 behaviors			2
@entity27 's comes with challenges along with the great opportunities			1
do n't shy away from @entity27 because they have different mannerisms or behaviors			2
be aware of them and understand how to respond to them			0
if you do , you will see @entity27 as the invaluable people they are and afford them the respect they deserve			1
readers support @entity27 's community			1
