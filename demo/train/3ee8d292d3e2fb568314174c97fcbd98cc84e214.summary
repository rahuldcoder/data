when @entity2 walked into the @entity4 supermarket in @entity5 , @entity6 , he was stopped at the door			1
he had his camera over his shoulder , and the international - style grocery store was built inside a large mall with a strict policy against photography			0
" they almost would n't even let me bring the camera inside , " @entity2 recalled			1
