-- @entity2 's friends call him cancer 's iron man			1
he 's had more than 90 radiation treatments and 200 chemo treatments since being diagnosed with head and neck cancer eight years ago			1
the cancer has spread to his right lung , his right arm and his brain			1
four years ago , he ran out of treatment options -- every available form of chemo had been used			1
if he wanted to live , he 'd have to enter clinical trials			1
" how long do i have here ? " he asked his doctor			0
" with treatment , two years , " the doctor responded			1
" without treatment , six months			1
" now , @entity2 , 61 , is sitting in a doctor 's office , ready to undergo a ct scan that will determine if his cancer is being kept in check			1
he 's on his fourth clinical trial			1
three times , he 's heard bad news			1
he tries not to think about that as he slides into the giant machine that envelopes his body			0
he thinks instead of his wife and 13 - year - old daughter , adopted from @entity33			0
life offers too much to give in			0
" i will know when there 's not a whole helluva lot of time left			1
and i do n't feel that way right now			0
... if what i 'm doing can help somebody down the line , then it 's worthwhile			1
" holding disease at bay @entity2 is one of 16 patients with progressive forms of cancer currently taking part in a study of a developmental drug by the @entity52 , @entity53 - based @entity51			1
the company hopes to add another 20 patients to the trial in laboratories in @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60			0
the test drug is in the second phase of a three - phase process that takes years before the @entity64 even considers whether to bring the drug to market			1
@entity2 is one of the tens of thousands of people worldwide enrolled in drug trials			1
according to @entity70 , there are more than 96,500 trials under way in 174 countries			1
@entity2 learned of drug trials through his oncologist -- " otherwise , i 'd know nothing about them			1
" he wants to make others " aware of head and neck cancer , and that clinical trials are available , " he says			1
" people need to be aware , though , that they are rolling the dice			1
" in this case , the chemotherapy drug , known as @entity85 , is placed inside nanoparticles -- tiny particles just slightly bigger than molecules -- that are delivered intravenously every two weeks to patients			2
the hope is that the nanoparticles target the cancer and release chemotherapy inside the tumors while shielding healthy tissue from the toxicity of chemo , says @entity99 , the president and ceo of @entity101			2
by doing that , the drug homes in on the tumors and , at the same time , patients can maintain a decent quality of life			2
" you want to see how long you can actually hold the disease at bay , " @entity99 says			0
adds @entity110 , @entity101 's chief medical officer : " the true measure of success in oncology is extending the length of time someone stays alive			1
" yet this drug is far from market			2
the @entity64 can put a stop to a clinical trial at any moment if unexpected safety issues arise			1
" we keep in touch with the @entity64 constantly throughout the clinical trial , " @entity110 says			1
" there 's a constant interchange with the @entity64 , particularly with respect to the safety of the drug and anything unexpected			1
" it takes about nine years for an oncology drug to go through the necessary clinical studies to @entity64 approval , said dr. @entity135 , director of the @entity136 for the @entity137 , an independent nonprofit research group			1
according to a 2007 study by the center , a drug company spends about $ 1.3 billion per approved product , a figure that includes costs of failed test drugs			1
when the test drug is for cancer , the patients have very aggressive forms			1
success is often measured in small steps			0
" what you 're normally looking at in this patient population , if you can keep it at bay for two months , you are actually doing quite well , because the patients are so far along " with cancer , says @entity99			2
" it 's a rule of thumb at best , because every disease is different , every patient is different			2
" ' i went through every type of chemo ' it started with a lump in his throat eight years ago			2
@entity2 thought it would go away			1
his doctor diagnosed it as head and neck cancer -- a surprise to @entity2 because he 's never been a heavy drinker or smoker			1
he underwent 36 radiation and chemo treatments over 2Â½ months			2
he survived on a feeding tube for six months			0
the next three years would be cancer free			1
but in june 2005 , a tumor popped up in his right lower lung			0
chemo and radiation began again			0
the tumor was eliminated , yet a spot showed up again about a year later			0
" you get to a point where they ca n't radiate the lung any more			0
" he still has breathing problems from the radiation to his lung			0
one chemo treatment clogged up his tear ducts			2
another created a rash all over his body			0
" by june 2006 , " he says , " i went through every type of chemo that 's been approved for head and neck cancer			1
the chemo would either stop working or the side effects would be more detrimental to my health			0
" his option : die or enter clinical trials			1
the first study kept his tumors -- by that time he had four -- in check for about five months			2
to remain in a trial , tumor growth has to be limited to 20 percent			0
a scan showed 22 percent growth			0
" you ca n't immediately go from one study to another			2
you have to be washed out for 30 days of chemicals and radiation			0
" in his second study , he developed a tumor on his right arm			2
he soon was having vision problems and started losing his hair			0
the man who had already endured so much was diagnosed with a brain tumor			0
in december , he underwent surgery to remove it			2
his third study earlier this year did not work			2
" you hold your breath , hoping that it 's working			2
then , when the @entity233 comes back and it shows the tumors are growing , it 's really frustrating			2
" " do i get depressed ? yes			0
but do i want to give up ? no , " he says			0
so @entity2 entered his fourth study this summer , the trial by @entity51			1
fighting on dressed in a medical gown , @entity2 awaits the ct scan			1
he 's gently glided into the large tube			2
the tests take just a few minutes			0
he does n't look for sympathy			0
he has no complaints about what he 's been dealt			2
in fact , he celebrates life because " it 's been good to me			2
" his little girl was 5 when he was diagnosed			0
he says far too few cancer patients who could be eligible for trials are aware of them			1
he wants others who are suffering to be more proactive -- to ask their doctors about all their options			0
slowly , he emerges from his ct scan			0
the waiting for results begins			0
he tries not to get his hopes up			0
his phone rings after a few hours			0
on the other end of the line , his doctor delivers the best news he 's had in more than a year			0
his cancer has grown at a rate of 11 percent , enough to remain on the study			1
yet the good news is only temporary			0
a few weeks later , blood shows up in @entity2 's bladder and a new tumor is found on his back			1
his doctor advises getting him off the study			0
@entity2 hopes to enter a new one soon			1
" you 're always on a roller - coaster when you have cancer			0
you have some successes and a lot of failures			0
" does he still have the fight to live ? " definitely , " he says			0
@entity0 's @entity283 contributed to this report .			0

@entity2 has been *battling* cancer for eight years
he turned to clinical trials to stay alive after regular treatment options ran out
he underwent his fourth clinical study this summer ; he 's one of 16 people in the study
before @entity64 approval , a drug goes through *yearslong* testing
