president @entity0 canceled a campaign trip at the last minute to stay in @entity2 and spearhead a more aggressive national response after @entity4 infected two nurses and frightened @entity6 with the prospect that their health system is not equipped to handle a catastrophic medical event			1
@entity0 said wednesday that monitoring of @entity4 must be done in a " much more aggressive way			1
" he continued , according to the pool report , to say that as soon as someone is diagnosed , the @entity12 must have a rapid response team immediately on site			1
the @entity18 is taking this very seriously at the highest levels			0
the president made the comments after a special meeting of his cabinet that was convened to address @entity4 and came as one of the infected nurses in @entity27 was transported to special hospital facilities in @entity29 for care			1
get up to speed on @entity4 developments @entity0 said the @entity12 would deploy new @entity34 teams within 24 hours to any hospital with an infected patient			1
he also promised that the federal government would review contacts made by infected people before they showed symptoms			1
but he urged calm , repeating that @entity4 is not easily spread if someone is not showing symptoms			1
" here 's what we know about @entity4			1
it 's not like the flu			0
it 's not airborne , " the president said , adding that he had met , hugged and even kissed health care workers at @entity50 in @entity51 who had treated @entity4 patients			1
the @entity18 announced wednesday that it was postponing @entity0 's campaign trip -- which included stops in @entity57 and @entity58 -- in order for the president to meet with " @entity24 agencies coordinating the government 's response to the @entity4 outbreak			1
" with the potency of his last years in office on the line , @entity0 was expected to cautiously step back on to the campaign trail wednesday , rallying @entity68 in dyed - blue @entity57 working to keep the governor there in office			1
but the president still will continue to mostly avoid campaigning in @entity73 contests , sticking to the gubernatorial campaign trail in three visits over the next week and four more planned trips in the final week of the 2014 season			0
only one of those trips -- in @entity80 -- is set to involve @entity82 's @entity73 nominee			0
vulnerable candidates in places such as @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 and @entity88 have been loathe to invite @entity0 to rally for them in their own states , spooked by his low approval ratings and the unpopular policy initiatives they helped move through @entity92			2
that 's left @entity0 relegated to the role of chief fund - raiser , jetting to wealthy enclaves across the country to try and keep donors encouraged enough about @entity68 ' chances to keep writing checks			2
it 's been a tough sell recently , with republicans almost certain to retain control of the @entity105 and models giving the @entity107 an edge to take the @entity73			0
@entity18 : no @entity110 replacement until after midterms in @entity57 , where @entity0 had been scheduled to speak wednesday , gov. @entity112 is tied with @entity107 rival @entity113 , who served as the @entity6 ambassador to @entity115 from 2006 - 2009			2
a @entity118 / @entity117 poll had both men at 41 % among likely voters in a survey taken the last week of september			0
a @entity18 official had said earlier @entity0 would also campaign with two @entity68 gubernatorial candidates on sunday : @entity124 in @entity125 and @entity126 in @entity127			2
both have slight edges over their @entity107 rivals , and will depend on high turnout among african - americans , one group with which @entity0 still has sway			2
@entity0 's midterm malaise @entity57 and @entity125 are both deep blue , swinging in @entity0 's direction by wide margins in both 2008 and 2012			2
in @entity57 , voters have been more willing to send @entity107 to the @entity140 -- when @entity141 took office in 2011 he succeeded two @entity107 governors			0
and @entity0 will use the final week of the campaign season crisscrossing the country to boost gubernatorial candidates in @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity80			0
@entity18 aims to show @entity0 at work in states with tight @entity73 races that are either @entity107 - leaning or true battlegrounds , @entity68 have gone to sometimes extreme lengths to avoid @entity0 's drag			0
@entity157 , challenging senate minority leader @entity156 in @entity85 , would n't even say whether she voted for @entity0 in the last election			0
the @entity18 , while defending @entity0 's economic record , says issues such as @entity4 and combating @entity161 have occupied the bulk of his time			1
but they say he 'll do what he can for @entity68 ahead of november 4			0
" the president obviously has got a few things on his plate these days , but ( he ) is looking forward to the opportunity to campaign with other candidates in advance of the midterms , " press secretary @entity166 said tuesday .			0
