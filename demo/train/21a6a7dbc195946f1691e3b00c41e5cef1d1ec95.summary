@entity1 exercise can help patients with failing hearts feel better -- and it 's safe , according to the largest - ever study of exercise in people with chronic heart failure , published as two articles in the @entity10			1
patients in the exercise group were given exercise training and either a treadmill or an exercise bike			2
the study 's results may not have been groundbreaking : fewer than half of patients were fully following the recommended exercise regimen ( the equivalent of brisk walking or stationary cycling for about two to three hours a week ) by the end of the study , and the effect of exercise on mortality and hospitalization risk was small			1
but these benefits should n't be dismissed , given the poor quality of life many chronic heart failure patients have , says @entity33 , @entity34 , medical director of the @entity35 and @entity36 in @entity37 , @entity38			1
" having any strategy that 's reasonable , that has the potential to help even a little bit , is pretty important , " says @entity33 , who was not involved in the research			0
" the real gain might be in helping our patients feel better			2
" about 5 million people in the @entity49 have chronic heart failure , in which the heart becomes too weak to pump blood through the body effectively			1
not too long ago , bed rest was the standard treatment for these patients , who suffer from fatigue , difficulty breathing , and swelling of the legs , among other symptoms			2
but for the past 20 or 30 years , evidence has been trickling in to show that these patients can actually benefit from being active , says @entity64 , @entity65 , of @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68			0
to get a clearer sense of the benefits ( and potential risks ) of exercise for heart failure patients , @entity64 -- along with @entity74 , @entity34 , director of the @entity76 at @entity66 , as well as colleagues from several centers across the country -- randomly assigned 2,331 men and women with heart failure to one of two groups : standard medical care plus aerobic exercise training or standard care only			1
people in the exercise group started out with 36 supervised - exercise sessions , then were sent home with a treadmill or exercise bike and instructed to get 120 to 200 minutes of exercise a week			2
within three months , @entity64 and her team found , the exercisers said they felt better			0
" the average difference was modest , but it happened early , " @entity64 says			0
" and it persisted over time : 54 percent of the men and women in this group reported clinically meaningful improvements in their health status three months into the study , compared with 29 percent of people in the control group			2
" after two and a-half years , the people in the exercise group were slightly less likely to be hospitalized for any cause or for heart failure			1
they were also at modestly reduced risk of death from any cause , as well as death from heart failure			1
unsurprisingly , exercisers also were somewhat more fit than they were at the study 's outset			0
@entity120 : what puts you at risk for high cholesterol ? " i think this study really helps to show that when you look across a lot of different people , exercise is a good thing , " @entity64 says , noting that past studies have included far fewer women and older people			1
given that fewer than half of the patients in the exercise group were actually following recommendations for physical activity by the end of the study -- par for the course with behavioral - intervention trials requiring lifestyle changes -- @entity74 says he was n't disappointed that the benefits were small			1
" really , it 's quite remarkable in my opinion that we found these modest improvements , " he adds			0
@entity120 : good fats vs. bad fats : which fats are good for your heart ? when @entity74 and his colleagues broke down the results based on how well people were sticking to the exercise recommendations , an analysis not published in the @entity10 paper , more striking differences emerged			2
" the more you did with greater intensity , the greater benefit , " @entity74 says			0
it 's also important , he adds , that the research was able to confirm that exercise does not carry risks for people with stable heart failure			1
" it was not known that it was safe with this degree of certainty , " @entity74 says			0
the question now , @entity33 says , is whether insurers will decide to pay to help chronic heart failure patients exercise , given the modesty of the benefits			1
" we really ca n't deploy this in a broad way without getting support from payers , " he adds			0
" i ca n't forecast which way that will go			0
" @entity120 : how i survived a heart attack at 43 but @entity74 is willing to hazard a guess			0
because his analysis suggests that patients with the most severe heart failure benefit the most from exercise , he says , it 's likely that insurers will pay for exercise training for these patients who will offer them the " biggest bang for the buck			1
" try a free trial issue of @entity199 ! @entity200 2009			0

study : exercise in heart - failure patients is safe , helps well - being , reduces mortality
about 5 million people in the @entity49 have chronic heart failure
in heart failure , the heart is too weak to pump blood through the body effectively
