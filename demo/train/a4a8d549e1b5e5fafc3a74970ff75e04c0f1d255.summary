-- we do n't know much about the shooting at @entity3 just yet , but it has clearly jangled our collective nerves , dredging up the fear and shock and pain of 9/11 -- the wellspring of our modern airport security process -- reminding us that more than a decade later , flying is still a fraught experience			1
for those of us who were working for @entity14 or @entity15 , that day in 2001 changed everything			2
when we finally got back onboard , our workplace now included air marshals , armed pilots , martial arts lessons , tasers , fortified cockpit doors , and a new focus on vigilance , not warmth and customer service			2
" @entity31 " was less a greeting and more an opportunity to size you up			2
so , reports of today 's airport shooting raise new fears about weaknesses in this system			1
is it possible that the gunman who shot and killed one @entity40 officer and injured two of his colleagues may have made it through @entity3 security with a high - powered rifle ? ( as of this writing , that is not yet clear			1
) and is it time to start arming @entity40 officials ? no way			2
i can understand the urge to react , to grasp at anything that might protect travelers			0
i too want air travel to be safe ; hell , my husband is a pilot			0
but arming screeners at checkpoints well away from the airfield would n't be just another of the many precautions the airlines have taken to avert large - scale terrorism			1
it would simply be about protecting people from something that is everywhere in @entity15 : gun violence -- yes , at airports , and also at schools , at movie theaters , and malls			1
if you 're the kind of person who thinks that every teacher and hall monitor and mall cop and cinema usher should be armed , then you 'll probably feel safer if we give guns to @entity40 officers			0
and maybe flight attendants and customer service reps and baggage handlers			0
and probably bus drivers and ballpark ticket takers , and hospital staff			0
@entity3 shooting delays flights nationwide september 11 , 2001 , still hurts , but most of our public killings have been at the hands of angry or disturbed co-workers , students , neighbors , family members -- not terrorists			1
do you really want to start handing out guns to the people you work with ? probably not if you work for an airline where people are often underpaid , overworked , sometimes inhumanely exhausted and locked , perennially , in famously contentious relationships with management			1
even before 9/11 , it made me nervous that as airline workers , we skipped security entirely , simply hopping off the employee bus and entering a back door , bags and bodies unscreened			1
i feared that the next air disaster would be caused by a colleague with a bone to pick			0
of course , i was wrong , and thankfully employees ' bags are now screened , but giving guns to airline and airport workers is still a disquieting idea			1
i was never a fan of armed pilots , even in the nightmarish days after 9/11			0
another flight attendant might have felt reassured but , when i once walked into the cockpit of a 757 to find a pilot with a gun resting on his lap , i was most decidedly rattled			0
i had n't met the guy before and had no reason to distrust him , but even the thought of an accident was enough to make me question my safety ( turbulence anyone ? )			0
and a couple of chilling mishaps -- an inadvertent discharge in the cockpit of a @entity141 plane and an incident where a @entity144 pilot lost his gun in an airport -- demonstrate the potential dangers of even a best - case - scenario arming of the nation 's nearly 50,000 @entity40 agents			1
chaos , terror unfold inside @entity152 unquestionably , terrorism is a real concern for airlines , but like it or not , as @entity15 , we have also have to worry just as much about angry neighbors with guns			1
to fight our justified fear , some will undoubtedly push for more guns and others for fewer			0
one thing is for certain -- we will continually be forced to debate this			2
i only hope that we can find some common ground before the next reminder			0

@entity172 left a *legacy* of security *measures* by airlines and airports
*friday* 's shooting at @entity3 raises new security concerns , she says
hawk : violence in schools , malls and cinemas is more *prevalent* than terrorism
arming airline workers -- often underpaid and *over-stressed* -- is a *bad* idea , she says
