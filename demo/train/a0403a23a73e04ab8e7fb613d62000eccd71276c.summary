@entity0 -- for one week in august , the @entity2 will have a guaranteed place on prime time tv and , it hopes , voters ' undivided attention			1
for many watching , the @entity7 will provide the first glimpse of a political fight that has been brewing for more than a year , presenting the @entity2 with a new opportunity to argue that it 's best prepared to take over after november 's election			2
" the convention is about unifying the party behind the presumptive nominee , " said @entity12 , communications director for the 2008 @entity2 convention and currently a managing director with global communications firm @entity15			1
" speaking slots are often a way to heal old wounds after bruising primaries			0
" @entity12 also pointed to a speaker 's prominence -- or their status as a " rising star " -- as another factor in determining who to put on the convention stage			2
the decisions on who will front the party , then , are loaded with opportunity -- but also the chance for pitfalls			1
" the speakers have been chosen because they make the best possible case to elect @entity40 and to show the @entity42 people the various positions and diversity of the @entity2 , " @entity2 strategist @entity37 said			1
" they 're the ones that have served in the trenches in the primaries and have supported @entity40			2
" " the ones who are left out are the ones who took shots at him , " @entity37 said			0
" either challenged or took shots at him , and they may not make the best case for his presidency , or they might try to overshadow him			0
" not every convention speech puts the party 's best foot forward			0
@entity64 's " @entity66 " speech at the 1992 @entity2 convention was met with consternation from moderates , who regarded the address -- which included opposition to gay rights and women in combat -- as unnecessarily polarizing			1
@entity76 's speech introducing 1988 @entity78 nominee @entity77 was so long that people actually cheered when it was over			0
the convention -- set to begin august 27 in @entity82 , @entity83 -- has already put together a roster of speakers that features both the party 's establishment and its up - and - comers			1
sen. @entity89 , who accepted the party 's nomination at the 2008 convention , will deliver remarks , as will former @entity83 gov. @entity94			1
former secretary of state @entity95 is another well - known @entity2 who will have a turn at the podium			2
other establishment picks , however , will sit this year out			0
@entity99 said he was taking " time off the political stage , " and his father , @entity100 , wo n't attend for health reasons			0
former vice president @entity103 , who received a heart transplant earlier this year , will also not appear onstage in @entity82			0
@entity105 , the former @entity106 speaker and one - time 2012 @entity2 presidential candidate , will hold daily policy workshops for delegates in @entity82 rather than occupy a prime - time speaking spot			1
former @entity113 sen. @entity112 will speak in @entity82 , but other @entity2 who challenged @entity40 for this year 's @entity2 nomination -- including rep. @entity116 and former @entity118 chief @entity117 -- have not been announced as convention speakers			1
@entity126 , the celebrity businessman and @entity40 supporter whose commitment to the " birther " movement that challenges @entity124 's place of birth leaves many @entity2 queasy , said through a spokesman last week he would have a " memorable " role at the convention , but that it would n't include a prime time address			1
@entity133 , who delivered a warmly received convention address at the 2008 event , wo n't speak in @entity82 either , saying , " everything i said at the 2008 convention about then - candidate @entity124 still stands today			2
" @entity139 , a @entity1 contributor and professor of history and public affairs at @entity144 , wrote in a @entity1 opinion piece last week that the conventions " create a forum to showcase the talent of the future on a national stage			0
" they also give parties the opportunity to control what that future might look like			0
on tuesday , the @entity82 lineup was updated to include @entity159 gov. @entity158 in the keynote slot , a high - profile role meant to rally the party behind the nominee			1
then - @entity163 state sen. @entity124 delivered the keynote address at the @entity165 , launching him onto the national political stage and into the @entity106 four years later			1
" the keynote speaker is someone that millions of @entity42 are going to watch , and they have to make the best possible case for @entity40 to be president , " @entity37 said			2
" that speaker is extremely important			0
the campaign is relying on @entity158 to carry their message to the world who will be watching			0
" @entity158 told @entity178 he was on the fourth draft of a speech that would include " some very direct and hard truths " about the state of the country -- a glimpse of a straight - talk speech that @entity2 have come to expect from the straight - talking @entity158			1
many republicans encouraged @entity158 to run for president and he was seen by many as the best bet for the no. 2 spot on @entity40 's ticket			2
" speakers who are known for an ability to energize the base receive more prominent roles , " @entity12 said			0
" @entity158 is a good example			0
" @entity158 's famous swagger excites many @entity2 , who like seeing the anger they feel toward bigger government and out - of - control debt reflected in their elected representatives			1
but his relatively moderate social views , which line up with the state he represents , turn off some in the @entity2 party base			2
another chance to craft the party 's image comes in the person chosen to introduce the nominee			0
this year that honor goes to @entity83 sen. @entity211 , who will draw cheers from delegates aligned with the tea party , which helped vault @entity211 past a mainstream @entity2 rival in 2010 's @entity83 @entity2 primary and into the @entity218			1
to put that into context , @entity76 , a @entity78 elder statesman , will put @entity124 's name into nomination at the @entity223 the next week			0
putting @entity211 , as well as @entity225 candidate @entity224 and @entity227 gov. @entity226 ( also tea party favorites ) , in prime - time speaking roles at the convention also signals the @entity2 's push to bring in @entity234 voters , who overwhelmingly went for @entity124 in 2008 and polls show going the same way this time around			1
@entity226 and @entity241 , along with @entity238 gov. @entity237 and @entity240 gov. @entity239 , will also use their convention roles to try to close the gender gap that polls show persists between @entity124 and @entity40			2
ultimately , @entity12 said , putting together a lineup is about finding people who represent -- and can rally -- the base			0
" fundamentally , convention speaking lineups are meant to represent a cross-section of the party 's faithful -- and i expect the 2012 @entity2 and @entity78 conventions to be no exception , " @entity12 said			1
@entity1 's @entity255 and @entity256 contributed to this report			0
