@entity1 , @entity0 -- a series of recent fires in at least five detention centers around the country has raised questions about living conditions in @entity0 's prison system			1
late saturday night a fire broke out in the dormitory of a prison in the southeastern province of @entity14			2
the fire claimed the lives of 13 prisoners and injured five others before authorities successfully extinguished the blaze			1
prisoners reportedly set fire to their mattresses to protest cramped and unsuitable living conditions			1
a day after the first protest blaze was put out , prisoners in the same prison once again set fires in the dormitories , this time injuring 42 , according to the semi-official @entity30			1
the latest prison fire occurred tuesday in the southern province of @entity33			2
there were no casualties but inmates had to be evacuated to the prison yard			2
on monday , similar fires were reported at other detention facilities , including prisons in @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			0
" overcrowding is the primary problem , " said @entity44 , president of the @entity45 in @entity0 , or @entity46 , pointing out that the @entity14 prison is equipped to house 375 prisoners but currently houses nearly 1,200			1
the cell where the fire started was furnished with six beds but housed 18 prisoners , according to an @entity46 report			2
" when i was in the prison , at first we were six people in a six - person room , which was fine			0
but then , two by two they put more people in			0
ultimately , we were 14 people living in the room , " said @entity62 , who spent three months in the prison last year awaiting trial			0
such overcrowding is not a new problem in @entity0 , according to officials			1
" this is a problem that evolves from the past ( but is ) getting smaller as ( we ) head into the future			0
the steps that we have taken in order to minimize and eventually eliminate the problem are evident , " said justice minister @entity73 at a press conference on tuesday			0
@entity0 is in the process of upgrading its prison system and will increase its capacity nearly twofold by 2017 , according to officials			1
the primary reason for overcrowding in @entity0 prisons is a judicial system that errs on the side of detention rather than releasing the accused on bail before and during legal proceedings , and a new penal code that has lengthened prison sentences			1
according to the justice ministry , 27.5 % of prisoners are detainees awaiting the outcome of their trials			0
but @entity44 maintains that 41 % of all prisoners in @entity0 are either awaiting trial or a decision from an appellate court , a situation made more problematic , he says , by the fact that over half of appealed convictions are eventually overturned			2
according to @entity106 researcher @entity105 , it is not only the problem of overcrowding , which is present in many of the world 's penal systems , but also the lack of transparency that prevents prison conditions in @entity0 from conforming to accepted international standards			1
" human rights groups and ( nongovernmental organizations ) can not visit prisons easily without lengthy procedures , " said @entity117			0
" @entity0 lacks a regular system of independent monitors			2
" experts who are in the best position to identify and prevent hazardous conditions are thus unable to make firsthand observations , reducing pressure that might otherwise accelerate improvements to basic necessities such as medical care and infrastructure			0
" the capacity to respond to these complaints , to take measures to prevent the kind of tragedy that happened at the ( @entity14 ) prison , we are not seeing at the moment , " said @entity117			0
@entity14 prison has been in the headlines before			0
after his requests for a transfer were denied , an inmate who lit himself on fire in protest of living conditions died in july 2010 .			1
