-- where would you take a loved one for an anniversary or other special occasion ? @entity5 1 , a @entity7 classic , where food is the main focus -- far from the artifice of fashion and modernity			1
a comfortable environment , it 's serious and without fanfare and it has become a special place for celebrations			2
it 's common to see couples celebrating their wedding anniversary or groups of young businessmen eating there after a successful project			2
the menu is varied and of high quality , coming from one of the leading authorities in ( @entity30 cuisine ) , the chef @entity31			0
the wine list is one of the best in town			0
what 's the best place to try to spot a-list celebrities ? there are n't too many celebrities around @entity7			1
local celebrities often go to restaurants in @entity42 , a traditional old quarter of the city , that in recent years has grown with its trendy restaurants and boutique hotels			1
but international visitors who visit the city often go to @entity51 , where the celebrated restaurant at @entity53 is located			1
what is your favorite neighborhood and why ? @entity57 is my favorite neighborhood because it has a bit of everything that makes the city attractive : the nostalgia and elegance of the tango , with the energy and vitality of modern places to eat			1
it 's a great neighborhood to walk in or bike around			1
it 's where young fashion designers have their shops			2
and on weekends they have clothing , food and music fairs on the streets and it 's a traditional meet - up point			2
in the evening it 's taken over by young people who find a wide range of fun things to do there			2
and it was one of the places where @entity85 lived and the setting for some of his stories			0
that 's why one of the main drags in the neighborhood bears his name			1
what is the biggest misconception about your city ? that everyone in this city knows how to dance tango and plays soccer			0
and that the only thing we always eat is steak , and would never choose another dish to savour			0
where do you go to relax ? the @entity110 , on the outskirts of the city , is a great place to take a walk and is accessible by train or bus			1
it 's where the @entity116 flows into the @entity118 through a number of streams			0
the lush vegetation and the silence of nature has led many folks to choose this place for their weekend homes			0
if you do n't have your own boat , there are group boats to take you along the river			0
where was your most memorable meal ? during the late 2001 crisis in @entity30 , the country was literally in flames -- enraged protesters set fire to the palm trees on @entity140 , the main avenue in the downtown area			0
there was rolling coverage throughout , so we had to order takeaway food to continue at work			0
and to alleviate hunger , there was the wonderful @entity30 pizza -- the legacy of the @entity153 immigration of the early twentieth century			0
our favorite pizzeria was always @entity155 , a historic place in this city -- a place that the legendary @entity158 ( an iconic @entity30 tango star ) would frequent			1
where can a visitor find good souvenirs ? one place tourists rarely miss on their way through @entity7 is the @entity165 , a quaint seaside town of colorful houses in the @entity169 neighborhood			1
it 's near the famous @entity172 stadium where locals go to see the @entity175 football team			0
@entity165 is where tourists traditionally get most of the souvenirs that they take back home			0
the vast majority have motifs related to tango and you can even pay for photos of tango dancers doing their seductive moves			0
where can you get the best view of the city ? the city of @entity7 has no highs and low points -- it 's mostly flat so there is no place that works as a viewpoint			1
but the plaza mayor with its @entity204 , the seat of government , the @entity198 and the @entity199 ( the government palace in @entity202 viceroyalty times ) make it a popular place for taking photographs			0
the same goes for @entity51 , the last neighborhood built on land reclaimed from the city of @entity118 , where restaurants , hotels and luxury buildings give it a unique look			1
what 's something to see that might not be on the radar ? tourists often come to the city for tango and usually fall into the shows meant only for tourists			2
but for those who truly want more of this music they can find it in @entity230 -- the place where the local dancers go to showcase their skills ( far from the show lights )			1
that 's where we get to know the true spirit of this genre -- where you can understand the sensuality of their dancing and appreciate the ability of the dancers because it 's done without pretence			1
it 's not all about professional dancers , but rather those who work at other jobs during the week , but they love this dance and keep true the essence that made it famous throughout the world .			2
