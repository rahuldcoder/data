former @entity1 commissioner @entity0 on tuesday rescinded punishments against four players in the @entity5 bounty scandal			1
the ruling overturned a decision made in october by @entity8 , the current commissioner , against @entity9 , @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity12			1
@entity13 : goodell the big loser here under the bounty program , @entity0 wrote , @entity5 players were given incentives during the 2009 through 2011 seasons to render opposing players unable to play			1
they were called " cartoffs " and " knockouts			0
" in addition , it was alleged that the @entity5 offered a bounty for injuring @entity26 quarterback @entity25 during the @entity28 game in january 2010			1
in october , after he upheld suspensions , @entity8 appointed @entity0 to review player appeals			2
in his 18 - page order , @entity0 found that @entity12 's actions " were not conduct detrimental " and vacated a one - game suspension imposed by @entity8			1
@entity0 wrote that @entity12 " did not participate in the program including cartoffs and knockouts and that his participation in a ' non-injury ' pay - for - performance pool is typically subject only to club discipline			1
" @entity0 found that @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity41 engaged in " conduct detrimental to the integrity of , and public confidence in , the game of professional football , " but ordered their punishments also be rescinded			2
@entity50 's ruling ( @entity51 ) @entity10 had been suspended for seven games but was credited with having served five			0
@entity8 found that @entity10 falsely answered an @entity1 investigator 's questions about the misconduct			2
but @entity0 said it was not clear @entity10 lied about the program and noted that he was " under tremendous pressure to follow the chain of command in order to keep his job			2
" @entity0 concluded that there was insufficient evidence that @entity10 's alleged misconduct merited a suspension			2
@entity68 : ruling points finger at @entity5 brass @entity8 had suspended @entity11 for four games after finding he gave money to the program			1
but @entity0 said @entity11 was being singled out unfairly because he was a team captain			2
" on the present record , selective prosecution of allegations of misconduct and enforcement of discipline relative to @entity11 can not be sustained , " @entity0 wrote			0
" whatever the reason for such selective enforcement , it does not satisfy basic requirements for consistent treatment of player employees similarly situated			0
" @entity8 had found that @entity41 offered a bounty to any @entity5 player who could knock @entity25 out of the 2010 championship game and suspended him for the entire 2012 season			0
but @entity0 nixed that suspension , too , saying it was not clear that any such pledges were made seriously			0
" was it inspirational only ? " he asked			0
" was it typical ' trash talk ' that occurs regularly before games ? the parties presented no clear answers			1
" @entity0 wrote reducing the suspensions to fines could be justified in the cases of @entity10 , @entity11 and @entity41			0
" however ... this entire case has been contaminated by the coaches and others in the @entity5 ' organization , " he wrote			1
after the order was released , @entity5 quarterback @entity107 took to @entity109 : " congratulations to our players for having the suspensions vacated			1
unfortunately , there are some things that can never be taken back , " he wrote			0
are athletes who speak their minds out of bounds ? in a statement , the @entity1 noted that the matter had been reviewed by @entity8 , two collective bargaining agreement grievance arbitrators , the @entity121 and now @entity0			1
" the decisions have made clear that the @entity5 operated a bounty program in violation of league rules for three years , that the program endangered player safety , and that the commissioner has the authority under the @entity131 to impose discipline for those actions as conduct detrimental to the league , " the league said			1
" strong action was taken in this matter to protect player safety and ensure that bounties would be eliminated from football			0
" october : @entity8 upholds suspensions in a statement , the @entity142 , the union , said it was pleased with the decision			0
" vacating all discipline affirms the players ' unwavering position that all allegations the league made about their alleged ' intent to injure ' were utterly and completely false			0
we are happy for our members			0
" @entity41 's lawyer , @entity154 , accused @entity8 of " trying every conceivable maneuver to avoid real and honest scrutiny of his manufactured allegations that @entity9 engaged in a bounty program aimed at opposing players			1
" though gratified that his client " no longer needs to worry about facing an unjustified suspension , " he said @entity0 's order " does nothing to rectify the harm done by the baseless allegations lodged against @entity9			0

decision by former commissioner overturns current @entity1 chief
case *affects* the @entity5 from 2009 - 2011
@entity0 says @entity5 given incentives to hurt opposing players
was it typical " trash talk " that occurs regularly before games ?
