when the influential cleric @entity1 recently called on fellow @entity2 to join the rebels fighting @entity6 president @entity5 's regime , he effectively called for the @entity8 conflict in the @entity9 to escalate in some countries and start anew in others			1
@entity1 said he was not demonizing all @entity12 -- but that is precisely the effect of his inflammatory words			2
he denounced @entity5 's @entity17 sect , an offshoot of @entity12 , as " more infidel than @entity20 and @entity21			1
" signaling a broader demonization of all @entity8			2
he also said the @entity24 militia @entity23 ( whose name means " the party of @entity27 " ) is really " the party of the devil			0
" " how could 100 million @entity8 ( worldwide ) defeat 1.7 billion ( @entity2 ) ? " @entity1 asked , speaking may 31 in @entity29 , @entity30 , about the two largest @entity32 sects			1
" only because they ( @entity35 ) are weak , " he said , attempting to inspire the @entity2 to go to @entity6 to fight against @entity5 and prove their strength			1
" i call on @entity2 everywhere to help their brothers be victorious , " @entity1 said in his sermon			2
" everyone who has the ability and has training to kill ... is required to go " to @entity6			0
" we can not ask our brothers to be killed while we watch			0
" such provocative statements are classic @entity1 , who in 2008 warned of the " @entity45 " of the @entity9			0
but as a clever operative , he knows this time his statements could escalate the conflict in @entity6 , @entity49 and @entity50			0
@entity1 's rhetoric could also embolden the @entity35 majority in @entity53 and the @entity8 majority in @entity55 , where the @entity35 royal family is fighting a @entity8 - led uprising			1
in addition , his statements could add legitimacy to the alarm in @entity61 , where @entity2 fear a possible , though improbable , infiltration of @entity12 from @entity63			0
@entity1 , who is a controversial figure in the @entity65 but has millions of @entity35 followers , timed his remarks on the heels of a speech a week earlier by @entity70 , the @entity23 leader			1
@entity70 acknowledged what had been an open secret -- that @entity23 fighters are in @entity6 battling the @entity35 opposition and supporting the @entity5 regime			1
like @entity1 , @entity70 said his condemnation of the @entity2 did not apply to all -- just those fighting @entity5 -- but he too aimed to escalate the sectarian animosity that has already begun to grip the @entity32 world			1
what is striking about the statements by @entity70 and @entity1 , and their timing , is that the other open secret -- a deepening sectarian conflict spreading throughout the region -- has now been publicly acknowledged			2
in the past , both men attempted to talk in fake pleasantries about the other sect			0
@entity70 claimed @entity23 was fighting the " resistance " ( the war against @entity91 ) for all @entity2 , and @entity1 spoke of closing the divide between @entity8 and @entity35			1
on may 31 , @entity1 reiterated this message in his @entity29 speech and explained why he has had a change of heart			0
" i kept calling for years ( for efforts ) to bridge the gap between sects , and traveled to @entity63 during the era of former president @entity102 ( but ) these fanatics ( in @entity63 ) and hard - liners want to disempower the @entity2			0
they deceived me and deceived many others like me by saying that they , too , want to bridge the differences , " @entity1 said			0
it is entirely possible that escalation of the sectarian conflict will lead to a profound remapping of some @entity110 states			0
this is already a likely possibility in @entity6			0
if a negotiated settlement is not reached between @entity5 's government and the opposition , @entity5 and his minority @entity17 could partition the country by forming their own enclave , apart from the @entity35 majority			1
in @entity49 , prime minister @entity119 is trying to sustain and consolidate @entity8 dominance by excluding the @entity35 from important institutions and labeling them terrorists			2
more broadly , the country is witnessing a return of @entity35 clashes at the societal level -- some of the largest since 2006			0
even before the @entity6 civil war began , sectarian conflict was a major outcome of the @entity131 invasion of @entity49			0
in the tug of war between the @entity8 and @entity35 , @entity70 's power is likely to diminish while that of @entity1 is likely to rise			1
once a leader who had support among the @entity35 for defeating @entity91 in a battle in 2006 , @entity70 , in fighting for @entity5 , has transformed himself and his movement into a strictly @entity8 paramilitary force engaged in a war with an uncertain outcome			1
@entity1 , however , is riding a wave of @entity35 triumphalism in the region and his sectarian rhetoric is likely to bolster the @entity35 ascendancy , no matter what happens in @entity6			1
both men 's words leave little hope for reconciliation between @entity8 and @entity35 , and instead serve as an open invitation for increased sectarian warfare -- now more likely than ever to be the most significant outcome of the recent @entity110 uprisings .			2
