-- @entity1 is a formidable sprint cyclist			1
dubbed " the fastest man on two wheels , " the @entity3 rider became the @entity4 in 2011 and has won a total of 25 @entity6 stages , including the @entity8 stage four years in a row			1
@entity0 caught up with him to discover what it takes to be one of the world 's best sprinters			2
in his own words : be competitive			2
like , really competitive " since i was a little kid , i was competitive with everything			1
it was n't good enough just to be the best that i could be -- i had to be the best of everybody , whether it was a spelling test at school , or it was in @entity26 ( physical education ) or a social club			2
" embrace your differences " i 'm different from a lot of bike riders , but that makes me good , because there 's something different about the way i race and there is something different about my results			1
it 's just that i 'm so much smaller , and so much more aerodynamic and much more efficient			0
my legs can go at maybe 15 revs per minute quicker than the other guys , who are big and have more muscle ; for them , it 's like winding up a toy and letting it go and gaining speed whereas ... i am small and aerodynamic and can get to my top speed quicker and hold it there			0
watch this : @entity55 bikes built for glory train your brain " i train my brain as much as i train my muscles			1
i am constantly on my @entity61 doing logic games , like @entity63			1
it trains the part of your brain that helps you make decisions and look at the whole picture			1
" trust your team " in the chaos that is going on in a bunch sprint , the biggest drainer of energy comes from mental stress , and just having to concentrate and make decisions			0
for me , it 's about keeping up my reserves until that final few hundred meters , so if there is someone there doing those things for me it really helps me store my energy			1
" have a photographic memory " i can do one lap of a circuit and know where all the potholes are			1
i know how sharp to do a corner and how fast to go around it			0
i can analyze so much more of what is going on around than i think a lot of my rivals can ; i can analyze the people around me and where they are and really take it in and absorb it quick			0
i do n't know why i do it , or how , i just know that i can			0
" be inspired by nay - sayers " when i was growing up , there was a lot to prove , and i had a lot of people pushing back			2
i get an extra drive off someone saying i ca n't do something , you know ? i do enjoy proving people wrong			0
it 's not the same anymore			0
i believe i am amongst the greatest sprinters in the history of cycling , so there is not much more to prove there			0

the @entity3 sprinter says he always had to win at everything , even as a kid
