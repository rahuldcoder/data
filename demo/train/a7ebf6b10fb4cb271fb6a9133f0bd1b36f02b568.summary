-- you most likely know @entity2 from his work as 007 , but he 's actually been quite busy since his @entity4 days			1
rom - com roles , quirky indie flicks here and there and spending time developing his own projects through his company @entity2 gives you the sense that this is a guy who 's dedicated to not only the craft of acting , but also to working instead of coasting on any prior associations			1
for his latest project , a tv mini-series adaptation of @entity21 's 1998 novel , " @entity22 , " he portrays @entity24 , a writer who seems to be going slowly insane at a remote lake town after his wife 's death			1
it 's a typical @entity21 thriller , with a host of supernatural and psychological twists			1
as " @entity31 , " @entity2 got his start on the small screen so there 's no mystery as to whether he could pull it off -- but with the creativity found on television these days , the medium is ripe for a versatile workaholic like @entity2			1
the actor recently spoke with @entity0 about his return to tv , how he brought @entity21 's character to life and what he thinks of the @entity4 franchise now			1
@entity0 : " @entity22 " is one of the first big returns for you to television since " @entity31			1
" brosnan : i have n't done tv in a good number of years			1
but i 've been saying to my agent , " look , please do not rule out tv			1
i enjoy it , i started my career there , it 's such fertile ground			1
" so , i got " @entity22			1
" the timing was great , i love @entity21 ... i 'd done one of his short stories a long time ago , called " @entity64			1
" @entity0 : what 's exciting about this medium to you these days ? brosnan : it 's a corporate world out there in the world of movie making			1
it 's really hard to raise the finances , as a filmmaker myself			1
it 's just really hard going			2
i have two pieces with my own company , @entity2 that are in development , that we just got the writers on and just got the heads - up from the studio			1
two shows that i would be in from time to time			0
it 's just interesting work out there			2
we 've started writing the scripts ... i do n't really want to talk about them right now , it 's a little bit premature			2
the one that 's going to be a half - hour show , it 's very cool			2
comes from the world of " @entity97 , " it has a sick attitude about it			0
tv is very exciting ; it 's get in , get out			1
this particular piece , " @entity22 , " happened so quickly			1
i had two weeks off before the last job i had , before moving into this			0
you can come away from a day 's work absolutely exhausted , but exhilarated , because it 's so fast			2
@entity0 : what 's critical to bringing a @entity21 story to screen ? his world 's are so rich as you 're reading it , but for a visual medium , it 's different			1
brosnan : ( director ) @entity114 is the one you have to tip your hat to			0
he 's extremely prepared and passionate and knows the @entity21 world so well			1
@entity114 and i did n't talk too much about it			0
it was fairly self - evident what had to be done with the story			0
at first i thought it was overly written with stage directions and it kind of irked me where it was telling me how to act here			0
as the piece wore on , the weeks went by , i realized more and more of the stage direction			0
@entity0 : there 's not a lot of dialogue between you and other characters			2
it was more the inner - conflicts that we see play out			0
how does one approach a role like that ? brosnan : the first three weeks it was just me in a house			0
it was like " @entity143			0
" there was only one person on the call sheet and that was me			0
that was a unique way to work and i actually found it extremely pleasant ; i did n't have to deal with any other actors ( laughs )			0
i could just have my own timing and my own emotional world , all to myself			0
that only goes so far			0
it 's hard to articulate how i got there , but it 's somewhat like " @entity143			2
" @entity0 : portraying fear is a critical aspect of a @entity21 story			1
how difficult is that ? brosnan : i did n't really have time to worry about that			0
how many ways can portray fear , things that go bump in the night , or how many expressions do you have up your sleeve ? that 's when you have to rely on the director , that he 's going to be in the right place to get that look			2
@entity0 : how did the book translate to screen ? brosnan : it 's pretty much there ; i think it 's better than the book			2
i found the book , at times , kind of slow and i thought the script had such a snap to it			0
you enjoy the sharp left turns that come at you			0
@entity0 : does @entity21 consult on something like this ? brosnan : i think there was a great rapport between @entity114 and him			1
he did n't come down			0
i called him up before i went off to shoot it , just to say hello and get his blessing , so to speak			0
there 's only one of him			2
he always has a point of view			0
@entity0 : have you been following the " @entity4 " franchise ? brosnan : ( @entity204 ) is one great @entity4			1
certainly does a magnificent job			0
@entity0 : he 's a tough one			2
brosnan : he 's a tough dude			2
big competition with " @entity211 " and one thing or another			0
he 'll be right as rain			0
" @entity22 " is a two - part mini-series that airs sunday december 11 and monday december 12 on @entity216 .			1
