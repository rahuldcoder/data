-- i was half asleep when i first read the news , so i was sure i must have misunderstood			1
the words on the small screen in my hand said , " @entity6 , @entity7			2
" i sat up and looked at the phone again , trying to make sense of it			2
my friend @entity7 had died suddenly , unexpectedly at the age of 56			1
soon , an avalanche of grief rolled across @entity15 , carrying a mix of shock , sorrow , disbelief -- and genuine love			1
i had met @entity21 many years before when we were both on staff at @entity0			2
but we never really worked together , and we did not become friends back then			1
in fact , i 'm not sure we ever spoke			2
@entity27 came much later , when we connected on @entity15 , and @entity7 became an unlikely part of my everyday life			1
i learned about his family , his interests , his intensity			2
and i discovered his many talents and strong political beliefs			0
social media had come along and created a new way to have a friend			1
he had continued working in media production , but his passion -- i should say one of his many passions -- was playing the trumpet , which he did brilliantly			0
i went to hear him play , in person , but our friendship was almost completely online			1
i have often used quotation marks in the past when referring to a @entity15 " friend " with more than a touch of sarcasm			1
are @entity15 connections really friends ? i have absolutely no hesitation in using the word to describe my relationship with my dear friend @entity7 , whose absence from my daily life has left a palpable emptiness			1
something has truly changed in my life because he 's gone			0
and i 'm not alone			0
hundreds and hundreds of people have poured out their emotions in that electronic community			1
at times , it feels as real , as close , as if we were standing in the same room			1
in some respects , we are closer			0
online , people express themselves with a special openness			1
they do n't have to wait their turn to speak , and the ones with small voices or introverted personalities can convey big , profound , touching emotions			0
online we can develop a kind of intimacy that eluded us in the nonvirtual world			1
on social media , we can share -- as @entity7 so often did -- big and small parts of our life , without worrying that others are too busy or simply not interested in hearing it			0
@entity15 allows us to renew contacts with people thousands of miles away , an extraordinary resource for those of us who have lived and worked around the world , and have cherished friends thousands of miles away			1
messages for @entity7 came from distant lands			0
many wrote as if he were still there ; as if he were reading all our comments , surely about to answer , or at least click " like			0
" his sister @entity100 told me the family has drawn comfort from the outpouring of love , including from people he never met in person			1
" rest in peace my friend , " so many have said , adding their personal touch , " enjoy that great jazz gig in the sky			1
" " may your soul fly free			0
" people commented on his intensity and his compassion			2
friends posted poems and pictures ' and urged @entity7 to " shake things up " in his new digs			2
some asked him to say hello for them to others who have moved on			0
several said they had never met @entity7 in person , but their online friendship had developed into something truly meaningful			2
among them was another man called @entity21 , whose connection was based on their shared name			0
i had already heard that story years ago from @entity7 on his @entity15 page for a time , @entity7 was posting a picture of his morning cappuccino , displaying his flowery foam designs			1
he frequently changed his profile image			0
some were playful , others serious			0
he posted his father 's or his mother 's photograph in honor of @entity149 or some other special occasion			2
he spoke of his childhood as a military brat , of his father 's heroism in wartime and his mother 's own heroics while @entity158 was away			0
he linked videos of his recording sessions , praised other musicians and argued for social justice			0
in occasional conversations , some on his page , some in private messages , he taught me about cinematography , he jovially explained the meaning of the military expression " @entity172 ! " -- " @entity173 , understood , acknowledged " he said			0
" @entity174 ? " he asked ? " @entity172 ! " i dutifully replied			0
@entity7 was one of those guys with an opinion about everything			0
@entity15 was perfect for him , and he was perfect for us , the ones who wonder around the edges and jump in for a quick dip every once in a while			1
mostly , he shared his views and his ideas , and he supportively commented on what the rest of us did and said and showed about our lives			0
during my first few months on @entity15 , i occasionally posted some of my articles on world politics , and @entity7 was quick to comment and debate			1
he loved politics and almost always took a strong leftist position , always displaying a steady social conscience			0
whether you agreed or not , there was no denying that he came to it from concern for other human beings			0
eventually , i decided to leave politics out of my @entity15 life -- although i occasionally slip -- and to try to make it more casual , about friends , leaving other social media , @entity205 and @entity206 , for more controversial matters			1
@entity7 , on the other hand , put it all out for the world to see , or at least for all his friends to see			2
he had a modern version of integrity that went well with his intensity			0
i stayed out of his political battles but often enjoyed reading them , watching him fearlessly take on the world on every topic			0
since the morning i learned of @entity7 's death , i 've started hesitating a bit before reaching for the phone in search of the latest updates			2
@entity15 , i have discovered , can sometimes bring very sad news			1
that 's because , as i have learned , it brings news about very real friends			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity230 .			1

@entity230 was shocked by the death of a friend on @entity15
she says the news pointed up that @entity15 friends can be real friends
online , people express themselves with a special openness , she says
