" @entity25 later apologized , but went on to lose the election			0

@entity47 hailed the prime minister with the greeting " @entity57 ! " and thanked him for a recent gift of a sweater			1

" what they need to do , " he told @entity48 , " is get @entity64 to get @entity67 to stop doing this s --- and it 's all over			0
" @entity47 on reporter the 43rd president of the @entity5 was no stranger to the gaffe -- entire books were written about his famous " bushisms " -- and they were in evidence even on the election trail			1

taking exception to a question from the @entity112 's veteran royal correspondent , @entity111 , the prince complained : " bloody people			0
i ca n't bear that man			0
he 's so awful , he really is			0
" the comment did little to repair @entity92 ' fractious relationship with the media , and proved that gaffes can still offend , even when couched in polite language			2
@entity120 to @entity4 @entity5 vice president @entity120 is in a class all his own when it comes to putting his foot in it			1
in one of his most famous blunders , he was caught on tape dropping the f - bomb while congratulating @entity4 over the signing of the controversial healthcare bill in march 2010			1

" during the taping of an interview for @entity144 , @entity135 whispered to a fellow pundit " i want to cut his nuts off			0
" @entity135 later apologized for his " regrettably crude " remarks , which became one of the immortalized soundbites of the campaign			0
@entity151 on colleagues -- and himself elections are fertile hunting ground for gaffes , as politicians battle for airtime and headlines , but then - @entity28 prime minister @entity151 found himself in trouble in 1993 when he admitted he did n't understand why people kept voting for him			1
the day after members of his conservative party had rebelled in parliament over plans to expand @entity28 's links with @entity167 , the normally unemotive @entity151 was heard referring to the eurosceptic mps as " bastards , " and threatening to " crucify " them			0
speaking to a reporter after an interview -- when he thought the microphone had been switched off -- @entity151 said he could not see " how such a complete wimp like me keeps winning everything			2

@entity203 was taped claiming that @entity5 politicians would all be in jail if they worked in @entity217 or elsewhere , as they all sold their votes			0
@entity219 on @entity54 while @entity203 's remarks did not prompt an attack on @entity222 , a joke by @entity5 president @entity219 at the height of the @entity225 could have had much more serious implications			1
