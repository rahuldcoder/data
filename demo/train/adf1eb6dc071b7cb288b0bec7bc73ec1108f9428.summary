@entity0 -- @entity4 @entity3 leaders met thursday night with @entity6 officials to consider including a government - funded public health insurance option , along with a provision allowing states to opt out of it , in a health care overhaul bill			1
sen. @entity13 has been the only @entity14 supporter of health care legislation			0
two senior @entity3 @entity4 sources told @entity1 that @entity4 majority leader @entity17 is leaning toward a public option with the state opt - out provision in the @entity4 health care bill that will reach the full chamber in coming weeks			1
according to one source familiar with the @entity6 meeting , the matter was discussed with president @entity25 but no decisions were made			0
republicans and some moderate democrats oppose a public option , threatening the chances for a bill that includes the provision to get the 60 votes necessary to overcome a @entity4 filibuster			1
the state opt - out provision is considered a possible way to get moderate @entity3 to support a bill with a public option			1
however , the spokesman for @entity3 sen. @entity39 of @entity40 , a key moderate , said @entity39 opposes the idea of a national public option with an opt - out for the states			1
in addition , the idea is opposed by sen. @entity13 of @entity47 , the only @entity14 to support any kind of health care proposal so far			0
@entity13 's spokesman , @entity50 , confirmed to @entity1 her opposition to the modified public option			2
@entity25 and @entity3 leaders say the nonprofit public option will bring competition to the health insurance industry and lower costs while expanding access to @entity59 currently without coverage			1
@entity14 opponents contend a public option would drive private insurers from the market and lead to an eventual government takeover of the health care system			2
of five health care bills approved so far by @entity6 and @entity4 committees , four include a public option			1
the other bill , from the @entity71 , includes nonprofit cooperatives instead of a public option and is the proposal supported by @entity13			2
in recent days , two administration officials have told @entity1 that the prevailing @entity6 opinion is for the @entity4 health care bill to include a so - called " trigger " mechanism proposed by @entity13 that would bring a public option in the future if thresholds for expanding coverage and lowering costs go unmet in coming years			1
the source familiar with thursday evening 's meeting said @entity25 " pushed for a so - called trigger , because it 's the more bipartisan way to go , " due to @entity13 's support for the concept			0
a critical @entity6 goal in passing a health care bill is the ability to call it bipartisan , so @entity25 officials are wary of doing anything to alienate @entity13			0
also thursday , 36 moderate @entity6 @entity3 threatened to vote against the current health care bill the chamber 's leaders are drafting because they do n't believe it will sufficiently reduce long - term health care costs			1
in a letter to house speaker @entity103 , @entity104 , and @entity6 majority leader @entity105 , @entity106 , the fiscally conservative @entity3 cited recent testimony by @entity109 director @entity108 that indicated health care costs under the @entity6 legislation could rise after 10 years			2
@entity108 " has already indicated that the bill does nothing to rein in the costs of health care , and therefore may not be sustainable outside the 10 - year budget window , " the letter said			0
" we will be unable to support any health care legislation that does n't meet the president 's goals of driving down and holding down the cost of health care , as determined by " the @entity109 , the letter concluded			0
a @entity3 leadership aide told @entity1 that final analysis from the @entity109 will be crucial to passing a bill in the @entity6			2
" if we do not get a reasonable sort of indication from @entity109 that we 're going to bend it , that will be a problem , " the aide said of lowering costs in the future			0
@entity6 @entity3 leaders learned earlier this week that the @entity109 projected their bill would cost $ 871 billion over 10 years and also reduce the deficit during that time			2
but the @entity109 was unable to assess what the impact would be in the next 10 years			0
moderate @entity3 have asked leaders for details about the long - term costs from @entity109 , but no final analysis has yet been released			1
rep. @entity143 of @entity144 , a leader of the fiscally conservative " @entity145 " @entity3 , initiated the letter because " the question of cost is n't one that should be swept under the rug , " said @entity143 's spokesperson , @entity150			0
@entity1 's @entity151 and @entity152 contributed to this story .			0

@entity4 @entity3 propose leaving public option up to the states
republicans , moderate democrats oppose any public option
@entity6 said to favor a trigger for a public option
@entity6 @entity3 seek more *information* on long - term costs of bill
