-- @entity6 massacre suspect @entity5 's purported 1,500 - page manifesto paints a picture of a deliberative , driven killer -- not a rambling crazy person , criminologists said tuesday			1
speaking to @entity0 after @entity5 's attorney said his client " may be " insane , @entity11 , a criminologist with @entity12 , @entity12 , rejected the suggestion			1
based on what is known at this point , " he 's not crazy , " @entity11 said ; he is a " sociopath , " but " not crazy			1
" criminologist @entity18 of @entity19 echoed those sentiments			1
" the behavior is crazy , but not necessarily the state of mind of the person committing it , " he said			1
" @entity26 murderers rarely are psychotic			1
they know what they 're doing			2
they do n't hear voices in an empty room			2
they 're mad , but ( mad ) in terms of bitter and resentful -- not how we often use ' mad ' to describe mental illness , " he said			2
both said a " crazy " person can be commonly understood as someone who can not tell the difference between right and wrong and does not understand the nature and consequences of his actions			1
@entity5 , 32 , has acknowledged carrying out a bombing and a shooting rampage friday , a judge said monday			2
authorities say eight people were killed in the bombing of an @entity50 building that houses prime minister @entity52 's offices , and 68 were killed at a youth summer camp run by his ruling @entity54			1
@entity5 said the attacks were necessary to prevent the " colonization " of the country by @entity58 , the judge said			2
experts -- who have not met @entity5 but have examined materials purported to be from him -- had different takes tuesday on whether the manifesto suggests he was motivated more by ideology or by a desire for infamy			1
but several agreed that he seems to have more in common with mass killers , from " @entity68 " @entity68 to @entity71 shooter @entity69 , than with many terrorists and typical right - wing extremists			1
" if you see this killer as only a terrorist , you might see him as exceptional , " said @entity74 , also a criminologist with @entity19			1
" if you see him also as a mass killer , he fits the mold			2
" @entity11 said @entity5 's purported manifesto and the " @entity83 - type photos of himself " -- including one in which he is dressed in a wetsuit with a patch that reads " @entity88 " and holding a high - powered rifle -- suggest a " personal pathology , the need to be a celebrity , to achieve worldwide infamy may have been the real motive for this crime , " more than an effort to cause terror among a specific population			1
@entity69 , who killed 33 people at @entity71 in 2007 , also had a manifesto and took photos and a video of himself , @entity11 said			1
@entity18 , @entity74 's colleague at @entity19 , had a similar view			1
" i think this is more about vanity than insanity ... and in fact more self - promotion than promoting any particular ideology , " he said			1
" the posed photographs , video , and of course the manifesto -- it seems to be all about him			0
and when you consider his background , ( he was ) fairly unsuccessful , which is something you find commonly among mass murderers			2
they see , through their crimes , the opportunity to feel like a big shot			0
" the manifesto vows that a " @entity128 civil war " will lead to the execution of " cultural marxists " and the banishing of @entity58			0
at one point , the writer states that his " @entity131 " took him nine years to complete			0
the document contains a link to a video			0
the writer identifies himself as @entity5			0
@entity0 could not independently verify that @entity5 wrote the document or posted the 12 - minute video , and @entity6 authorities would not confirm that the man in their custody wrote the manifesto , saying it was part of their investigation			0
@entity5 says that he was in touch with two terror cells in @entity6 and in contact with other cells abroad , but that he acted alone in carrying out the attacks , his attorney said tuesday			0
@entity18 noted that " mass murders are typically well - planned executions			0
" @entity18 added that @entity5 's apparent manifesto suggests similarities to @entity156 domestic terrorist @entity155 , who killed 168 people in the 1995 bombing of a federal building in @entity160 , and to @entity68 , who killed three people and wounded 23 others in a string of bombings from 1978 to 1995			1
the @entity165 dubbed him the " @entity68 " because of his early targets : universities and airlines			1
" @entity155 had his own grudge against the government			0
and the @entity68 had his issues with technology			1
and in these cases and many more , they used murder as their means of filing a complaint , " @entity18 said			0
@entity179 , research director of the @entity180 at the @entity181 , wrote in an editorial for @entity0 that @entity5 " represents the exception rather than the norm in right - wing extremist circles			0
" traditionally , right - wing extremism has been disorganized and impulsive , and it has often been manifested through localized hate crimes against immigrants			0
... @entity5 was the polar opposite			0
his nine - year preparation for creating the lengthy manifesto and the violent action that he argues for and documents in minute detail contradicts our traditional view			0
he argues against impulsive acts of harassing foreign immigrants in favor of spectacular , well - prepared attacks			0
" @entity201 , @entity12 , said @entity5 is " much more deliberative " than people " like the impulsive neo-nazi " who goes out and attacks people , and seems to be more similar to @entity155 , who planned his attack deliberately			0
@entity11 said he believes ideology was probably @entity5 's chief motivation -- and seeking personal benefit took a back seat			1
" we 're seeing the rise of the aspirational extremist , " @entity11 said , describing someone who " perceives society as careening out of control off a cliff			0
" " this guy @entity5 had a very tight ideological argument for what he was doing , " the criminologist said			2
setbacks in @entity5 's life certainly played a role as well , @entity11 said			2
" when people face a ruthlessness and some kind of personal setback and they 've already been accustomed to an ideology that gives them comfort , they can ramp it up to violent forms of it			2
" @entity11 warned against writing off @entity5 , with his " islamophobic " writings , as a lone exception who does not reflect broader thinking around him			0
" while the violence was extreme , the actual sentiments are sentiments that are widely expressed in some form throughout the mainstream of @entity128 , " he said .			0

he 's a sociopath , but " not crazy , " a criminologist says
" @entity26 murderers rarely are psychotic , " another criminologist says
experts disagree over whether he was primarily motivated by ideology or a desire for infamy
