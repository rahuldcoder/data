@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 was rocked by a massive earthquake and tsunami in 2004 , @entity3 was glued to her television in @entity8 , @entity9			1
her two daughters -- 14 - year - old @entity11 and 12 - year - old @entity12 -- were vacationing in @entity1 at the time with her ex-husband and his new family , and she had n't heard any news of their whereabouts because phone lines were unreliable			1
with such a lack of information , it did n't take long for @entity22 and her partner , @entity23 , to hop on a plane			1
" i was so sure that when we arrived in @entity1 , i would have a ( text ) message telling me that i could come back home because we missed each other in the air , " @entity22 recalls			1
" unfortunately , i did n't have that message			0
" when @entity22 and @entity23 arrived in @entity32 , the city her daughters were staying in , they learned that it had been one of @entity1 's hardest - hit areas			1
" there was nothing left ... everything had disappeared , " @entity22 said			1
eventually , she had to face a tragic reality : that her daughters had perished along with their father and three other members of his family			1
" when i realized i would n't bring them back home alive , i wanted to die , " said @entity22 , 47			1
grief - stricken , and with no interest in returning to her advertising career , @entity22 was lost			1
but she frequently remembered the support and grace offered to her by the @entity1 people in their time of mutual crisis			1
so when she read that a @entity1 - @entity9 couple she 'd met were building an orphanage in @entity0 for children who 'd lost their families in the tsunami , she decided she wanted to help			1
" i felt a connection with the @entity1 people , " @entity22 said			1
" they had suffered so much more than i suffered			0
here , you had people that lost children , homes , everything , and they were strong			2
so i think that affected me , and their kindness to me was such that i wanted to give something back			0
" in march 2005 , @entity22 and @entity23 returned to @entity1 as volunteers at the orphanage , and in 2006 they made their stay permanent			1
they sold their @entity9 apartment and became the managers of @entity76 , a care home that has helped more than 100 children to date			1
for the first year , the facility cared for children and families directly affected by the tsunami			1
but as relatives reconnected after the tragedy , the original beneficiaries moved on and @entity87 's mission evolved			2
although @entity88 means " orphanage " in @entity9 , @entity22 says @entity88 is no longer an orphanage in the traditional sense			1
" it 's a home for children and ... families actually in need , " she said			1
" we do n't just help children			2
if we can help a child ... by helping mother or grandmother and keep them together , that 's even better than just ( helping ) the child			2
" all of the children at @entity105 come from dire poverty , and they 've often endured abuse , crime or neglect			2
while most have no one else to care for them , some do			0
and whenever possible , @entity22 works to keep families together			1
@entity88 currently houses 24 children , one mother and one grandmother , providing daily ongoing care			2
" love is the first thing they need , " she said			0
" @entity120 ( is ) food ... but then it 's school and education			2
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2011 @entity128 @entity22 and @entity23 have learned to speak @entity1 fairly well , and with the help of their @entity1 co-manager , nicknamed @entity133 , they strive to give the children a real home with all of the love , household chores and homework that come with it			1
" we want to be as close to a family as possible , " @entity22 said			1
" of course , we ca n't do it all the way , as we are a very big family			0
... ( but ) when something is good , we are happy together			0
if something bad happens , we cry together			0
that 's the most important if you work with children			2
not so much head , but a lot of heart			0
" education is also an important part of the @entity105 home , which is funded by charities , foundations and private individual donations			0
@entity22 ensures that a teacher visits after school to tutor youngsters who need extra support			2
" we ca n't decide what they should do with their lives , " she said			0
" but by helping them with education , we hope that we can help them have a choice			0
" in june , @entity88 achieved an important milestone			0
fame , a teenage boy who 's lived at the home since 2006 , started college			2
after he passed his entrance exam , @entity22 found a @entity9 family to sponsor his studies			2
she is excited about what it means for his future and that of the other children in her care			0
" we hope we can help the other kids understand that they actually can change their lives , " she said			0
while @entity22 has made a new life and family for herself in @entity1 , her daughters -- whose remains eventually were found in @entity32 -- are never far from her mind			1
" i think i feel closer to them here than i do in @entity9			0
i do n't know why , " she said			0
" i think of them every day			0
... " my daughters loved their life			0
and i wanted to show them that i would survive this			0
and if ( @entity201 ) could help my new children to love their lives , at least one good thing came out of this			0
" want to get involved ? check out @entity206 's website at @entity207 and see how to help .			0
