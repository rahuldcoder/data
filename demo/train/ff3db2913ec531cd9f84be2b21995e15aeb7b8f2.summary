-- authorities at @entity5 's @entity4 nuclear plant were investigating what caused a weekend radiation leak that resulted in 150 workers being sent home , officials said sunday			1
an airborne radiological contamination alarm sounded about 4 p.m. saturday in the unit 1 containment building , according to a statement from @entity13 , which operates the @entity4 plant near @entity15 , @entity5			1
the unit had been shut down since october 26 for refueling , maintenance and steam generator replacement , the company said			2
" a monitor at the temporary opening cut into the containment building wall to allow the new steam generators to be moved inside showed a slight increase in a reading and then returned to normal , " the company said			1
" two other monitors displayed normal readings			0
" @entity4 was the scene of the worst @entity32 nuclear accident , a partial meltdown in 1979 that resulted in the plant 's second reactor being shut down permanently			1
tests showed the contamination in saturday 's incident was confined to the building itself , and none was found outside , @entity13 said			1
there was no threat to public health and safety , but the workers were sent home because they could not continue until the area was cleaned , @entity42 , @entity13 vice president , said in the saturday statement			2
one worker was found to have received 16 millirem of exposure , and others received lower levels of contamination			2
the annual occupational dose limit for workers at @entity13 plants is 2,000 millirem , the statement said			0
radiation exposure from a chest x-ray is about 6 millirem , according to the @entity62			2
although @entity42 said it was hoped work would resume at @entity66 on sunday , @entity13 spokeswoman @entity63 told @entity0 on sunday it had not resumed , as the cause of the leak was still under investigation			0
two radiation specialists from the @entity62 were scheduled to investigate sunday			0
" numerous work activities were going on in the building at the time the alarm sounded , and @entity13 engineers are working to determine the cause of the incident , " the statement said			1
the march 1979 accident at @entity4 brought the nuclear industry to a standstill			1
the partial meltdown of @entity82 's nuclear core resulted in no injuries to plant workers or nearby community members , but it triggered changes in nuclear power plant operations and emergency planning and led to tighter oversight of the industry by the @entity62			0
the unit 2 reactor is permanently shut down and defueled , the @entity62 said			0
in 2001 , @entity93 acquired it and contracted its monitoring to @entity13 , which owns unit 1			0
the companies plan to keep unit 2 in " long - term , monitored storage " until the unit 1 operating license expires , at which time both plants will be decommissioned , the @entity62 said			0
a new generation of nuclear reactors is being considered in the @entity32 as environmental concerns have intensified about coal - fired power plants			1
