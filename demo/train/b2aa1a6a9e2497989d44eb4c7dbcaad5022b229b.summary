@entity0 -- when @entity3 suffered a massive earthquake two years ago , many people responded by donating money			0
@entity6 responded with a @entity8 post			1
" i 'm going to @entity3			0
who 's in ? " wrote the former @entity9			2
the images @entity6 was seeing on the news reminded him of his tours of duty in @entity15 and @entity16			1
he realized that the skills he had acquired in the service , including the ability to adapt to difficult conditions , work with limited resources and maintain security in a dangerous environment , were sorely needed			0
" those are just lessons that you work at every single day in @entity27 , " said @entity6 , 28			1
" to a veteran , it 's second nature			2
" @entity6 wanted to help , and he persuaded his college roommate , a firefighter , to join him			1
within minutes of seeing @entity6 's @entity8 post , another friend and former @entity9 , @entity34 , signed on			1
interest quickly snowballed , and soon donations poured into @entity6 's @entity37 account			1
three days later , he and seven others were in the @entity39 , heading into neighboring @entity3 with medicine and equipment			0
over the next three weeks , more than 60 volunteers -- mainly from medical or military backgrounds -- followed @entity6 's lead and made their way to the stricken country to join his group			1
they set up triage centers in camps , treating whoever they could , and helped ferry people to hospitals			0
@entity6 estimates they helped thousands of @entity3			1
they called their group @entity57 , in reference to the phrase " crossing the @entity57 , " which means passing a point of no return			1
the moniker turned out to be appropriate			0
@entity6 had planned for the trip to be a one - time mission			1
but during their time in @entity3 , he and @entity34 became aware that they were on to something			0
" we realized we were more effective than many organizations that were down there with us , " @entity6 said			1
" we also realized that most organizations were n't engaging vets on their own			0
so we said , ' let 's try to improve this			2
' " @entity57 became a nonprofit , and @entity6 has never looked back			1
in the past two years , he says , the group has built an army of more than 1,400 volunteers -- 80 % of them military veterans -- who respond to disasters and help those in need			1
the team has conducted 14 missions			2
it ran triage clinics after the @entity86 earthquake and the flooding in @entity88			0
it traveled to @entity90 and @entity91 to help people caught in regional conflicts			0
and last year , it removed debris and assisted in search - and - rescue missions following tornadoes in @entity98 , @entity99 , and @entity100 , @entity101			0
do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2012 @entity105 disaster relief requires springing into action quickly , and @entity57 prides itself on being fast to deploy			1
senior team members monitor severe weather alerts via @entity110 , and when a storm is brewing , they notify volunteers in that region to make sure it 's on their radar			1
when the decision is made to deploy , the team quickly establishes a roster of needs online so volunteers can sign up			1
" we 'll tell them where to be , when , etc. " @entity6 said			1
" for instance , we 'll meet up , convoy in , ( and ) link up with the emergency operations center			0
" @entity6 never envisioned himself running a nonprofit			1
after graduating in 2005 from the @entity128 , where he also played football , @entity6 enlisted in the @entity9 and completed two combat tours			1
when his military obligation was up , he intended to go to business school			0
but a couple of weeks after he finished filling out his applications , the earthquake hit @entity3			0
' a reason to come together ' from the beginning , @entity6 and @entity34 believed that using veterans to respond to disasters made a lot of sense			1
but over time , they realized that the missions were also benefiting the veterans themselves , giving them a sense of purpose and self - worth that they often lose when they transition to civilian life			0
@entity6 believes that today 's veterans enjoy the fellowship that comes from giving back			1
" being able to help people and be a part of a team once again ... i think gives them some of ( what ) they were missing , " @entity6 said			1
" they are almost recharged			0
" @entity6 realized the importance of this after a personal loss in april 2011			2
his best friend , @entity160 -- a fellow veteran and @entity57 volunteer -- committed suicide			2
@entity160 had suffered from post-traumatic stress disorder and survivor 's guilt			0
it was a shock to @entity6 , as @entity160 seemed to be adjusting well			2
he was literally a poster boy for returning veterans , appearing in a public - service announcement for a veterans advocacy group			2
" it was tremendously difficult to feel like i had let him down , knowing that we had survived two wars together but that when things were easy and it had come to peace , that i was n't there enough for him , " @entity6 said			1
" that has been a very tough battle for me , dealing with that			0
" @entity160 's death made @entity6 realize how critically important the connections are that @entity57 enables veterans to build with each other			1
it also made the group refocus its own mission : instead of being a disaster relief organization that uses veterans , @entity57 is now a veterans support organization that uses disasters as opportunities for continued service			1
" we 're giving them a reason to come together ... and that community lasts long after the mission , " @entity6 said			2
" right now , @entity57 is focused on how we can ... get them involved in as many ways as possible			2
" the approach seems to be working			0
@entity203 served in the @entity204 for four years , working as an intelligence officer in @entity15 from 2003 to 2004			0
for her , finding @entity57 has been life - changing			2
" when i got out of the military , it was very stressful , " she said			0
you meet people who do n't understand your background			0
" @entity211 volunteered for the group 's first domestic mission , in @entity98			1
she enjoyed it so much that she helped out in @entity100 less than a month later			0
" i felt that i was doing something meaningful with my life again ... using a lot of the same skills , but in a way that ( was ) constructive instead of destructive , " @entity211 said			0
" and i was with other people who understood me ... focused on a common goal			0
that was really a great feeling			0
" @entity57 is working with several veterans organizations to recruit more volunteers , and @entity6 is aiming to have 10,000 on its roster by the end of the year			1
the group is also working on ways to keep volunteers engaged once they sign up by doing service projects at home and abroad			2
@entity6 believes that giving veterans a chance to give back is a formula for success , and he 's determined to bring his message to as many people as he can			1
" there 's no limit to what veterans can do			2
... they 've already proven that they want to serve ... and when they come home , a lot of them still want to do it , " he said			0
" it 's a win - win situation			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity57 website at teamrubiconusa.org and see how to help .			2

@entity6 started @entity57 to help those in need after natural disasters
most of the group 's 1,400 volunteers are military veterans who still want to serve
the nonprofit also gives veterans a chance to connect and feel part of a team
