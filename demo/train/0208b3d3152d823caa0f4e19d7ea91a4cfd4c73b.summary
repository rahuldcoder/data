@entity0 has some advice for @entity3 owner @entity2 : sell the team , take the money and enjoy the rest of your life			1
a day after @entity2 appeared on @entity9 slamming the @entity12 legend 's character , his battle with @entity14 and his community outreach efforts , @entity0 said tuesday that he feels sorry for the 80 - year - old billionaire			1
i 'm going to pray for this ... man , " @entity0 told @entity9 's @entity19 in an exclusive interview			1
@entity2 's explosive @entity9 interview that aired monday night was the first time he had spoken publicly since audio recordings surfaced last month of him making racist remarks			1
reaction to the taped remarks came fast and furious , and the @entity12 responded with a lifetime ban for @entity29			0
@entity0 became an involuntary figure in the controversy after @entity2 named him in the leaked recording			1
" admire him , bring him here , feed him , f * * k him , but do n't put ( @entity35 ) on an @entity36 for the world to have to see so they have to call me , " @entity2 is heard telling friend @entity33			1
@entity0 told @entity19 he is still waiting for an apology from @entity29 for getting roped into @entity2 's fight with @entity33 , and @entity0 called the monday interview -- in which @entity2 directed another tirade at the @entity12 legend -- " disturbing			1
" " what 's really sad is , it 's not about me , " @entity0 said			1
" this is about the woman you love outing you and taping you and putting your conversation out here for everybody to know			0
... this is between you two , but then he wants to include me			0
" @entity0 said he had only met with @entity2 three or four times , and most of those discussions had focused on basketball			1
@entity0 could n't say if the @entity3 owner has slipped mentally			1
@entity2 " seems like he 's all there , " @entity0 said			1
" but the problem is , he 's living in the stone ages			1
" @entity0 : @entity2 called me @entity2 went on the offensive in his interview with @entity19 when @entity0 's name came up , blaming the basketball @entity69 for @entity2 's delay in apologizing for the racist remarks that have him now fighting to keep his team			1
" wait , be patient , i 'll help you , we 'll work it out , " @entity2 said the @entity12 legend told him			1
not so , @entity0 said tuesday			2
in fact , @entity0 told @entity9 , @entity2 called him recently and asked him to appear alongside him in an interview with @entity81 's @entity80			1
" i said the number one thing you need to do which you have n't done is apologize to everybody , and myself , " @entity0 said			2
" ( @entity2 replied ) ' i 'll get to that			2
i 'll get to that			0
' " the former @entity12 star told @entity29 that the billionaire businessman needed to consult with attorneys , stressing that the controversy was bigger than @entity2 realized			2
@entity0 said @entity2 was adamant about @entity0 doing the interview , even reaching out a second time			1
@entity0 said his attorneys advised him not to have any further conversations with the embattled owner			1
@entity2 never did the interview with @entity80			1
" i 'm really disturbed by the fact that when he called me he should have said , ' @entity35 , i 'm sorry , ' " @entity0 said			2
a sterling solution : start talking honestly about race ' i do n't know that young lady ' @entity0 and the woman at the center of the scandal -- @entity33 -- have met briefly only once , the @entity12 legend said , taking a picture at a @entity109 game			1
@entity0 is a part - owner of the baseball team			1
" i do n't know the young lady			0
i barely know @entity2 , so now i am caught in the middle of this love affair or whatever they had , " @entity0 said			1
@entity33 has denied being intimate with @entity2 , who when asked about the nature of their relationship declined to answer			1
@entity0 said he does n't think @entity2 understands what a big mistake the @entity3 owner 's racist comments were or the number of people who were offended by the remarks -- and by @entity2 's statements to @entity19 that aired monday night , slamming @entity0 again			1
" what kind of a guy goes to every city , has sex with every girl , then he catches @entity14 ? is that someone we want to respect and tell our kids about ? " @entity2 asked @entity19 in monday 's interview			1
" i think he should be ashamed of himself			0
i think he should go into the background			0
but what does he do for the black people ? he does n't do anything			0
" in response , @entity0 defended his charitable work and business investments , saying @entity29 should have done his homework before making the comments			1
" my whole life is devoted to urban @entity145			0
so , you know i just wish he knew the facts when he 's talking , " @entity0 told @entity19			2
" but he 's a man who 's upset and he 's reaching			0
he 's trying to find something that he can grab on to help him save his team			0
and it 's not going to happen			0
" @entity0 says @entity2 disrespected the work he 's done , like helping coffee shops , gyms and theaters open in urban areas			1
" that really makes me upset			0
and then my competitive spirit comes out , because i 've done all this great work			0
all the kids we 've sent to college , and i 've got 150 kids on scholarship right now			0
" he also responded to @entity2 's @entity14 remarks , saying he never hid from the diagnosis when he retired from the @entity12 in 1991			2
" i came out like a man , you know , i told the world			0
i did n't blame nobody else			0
i understood that what i did was wrong , " @entity0 said			2
" ok , so i announced that to the world , and i hoped that i was able to help people in doing that , and i think i did			0
" @entity0 says @entity2 's comments about @entity14 show there 's still a stigma that needs to be fought			1
" i hope this does n't set us back , " @entity0 said			2
" the stigma is still there			0
we 've been fighting it for years , and what we want to continue to do is just educate the world that it 's ok , that you can high - five a person who has @entity14			0
... it 's a shame that @entity2 used this platform with you , instead of using this platform to come out and apologize to the world , which would have been great			2
" opinion : the 5 apology rules that @entity2 broke @entity35 's interest in a basketball team @entity0 , whose ownership interests also include the @entity201 's @entity200 in @entity202 , denied @entity29 's assertion that the former @entity204 was trying to deceive his way into buying the @entity3			1
the accusation made @entity0 laugh			2
" if i was going to trick somebody , deceive somebody , be dishonest to somebody , steal somebody 's franchise , it 's going to be the @entity204 , " said the man who won five league titles while with the team , one of the @entity12 's marquee franchises			0
@entity0 once owned a minority stake in the @entity204 , which have been owned by the @entity221 family since 1979			2
but @entity0 said he would entertain the idea of buying the @entity3 with his five partners who spent more than $ 2 billion on the @entity109			2
he thinks a sale forced by a vote of the @entity12 @entity227 would take at least eight months to complete and would be a $ 1 billion transaction			0
" if it comes out and it 's for sale , and my @entity236 ( @entity237 ) partners and i say , ' ok , we want to take a look at it , we want to buy it , ' of course , we 'll make a run for it , " he said , adding that he has had offers from other @entity12 teams to become a part owner			0
@entity2 's claims vs. reality time for change ? @entity2 , the longest tenured owner in the @entity12 , bought the team in 1981 when it was in @entity249 and moved into @entity202			1
but after his recorded racist remarks were revealed , the @entity12 began the process of forcing him to sell the franchise , which some experts have valued between $ 575 million and $ 1 billion			0
it will take a 75 % vote of the league 's owners to terminate @entity2 's franchise rights			2
the case is with the @entity12 's finance and advisory committee of 10 owners , which talked by conference call on tuesday , but did n't recommend sending the matter to the board			0
@entity2 has n't definitively said if he will sue to keep the team -- which is actually owned by a family trust that includes his wife , @entity267 , as a co-executor -- but many analysts expect him to do so			2
@entity0 noted @entity2 's past legal issues with his real estate business where he settled lawsuits brought against him and his wife with out - of - court payments			1
@entity2 " ca n't buy his way out of this one			2
he has bought his way out of all the other situations			0
ca n't do it this time , " @entity0 said			0
@entity0 said @entity2 should go into retirement			1
" you 're 80 years old			0
you 've had a tremendous life			0
and you 're going to benefit , whatever the price tag is , from this team selling			0
just go ahead and enjoy the rest of your life , " @entity0 said			0
" you 're fighting a battle that you ca n't win			0
" @entity2 asked : what has @entity0 done ? answer : quite a lot			1
