@entity2 's " @entity1 " the moral : never hire a communist to do a capitalist 's job			1
during the @entity8 , @entity7 artist @entity2 was on a roll			1
in 1931 , he painted a massive mural for @entity12 's @entity11			1
and by 1933 , he 'd completed two more enormous murals of @entity15 's assembly line for the @entity16			1
but there was a disconnect in @entity2 's work			1
although the artist was a vocal and committed communist , his art was decidedly capitalist			1
after a few friends pointed out the hypocrisy , @entity2 decided to put his paintbrush where his mouth was			1
@entity27 knocked in 1932 , when the @entity29 family hired @entity2 to create one of his signature paintings in the lobby of the new @entity33 in @entity34			1
their suggested theme for the work was " @entity37 with @entity38 and @entity39 to the @entity40 " -- an allusion to the crossroads between industry and technology			1
@entity2 's final product depicted a crossroads , but hardly in the way the @entity47 had intended			1
instead , the sprawling 63 - foot masterpiece illustrated two alternate futures : a communist heaven and a capitalist hell			1
@entity2 might have gotten away with his political statement if it had n't been for one detail -- he painted his personal hero , @entity56 , into the piece			1
when building managers realized @entity2 was filling their lobby with @entity62 propaganda , they ordered him to cease and desist			1
to preserve the art , the @entity47 asked @entity2 to morph @entity56 's portrait into an unrecognizable worker			1
but when the artist refused ( @entity2 offered instead to balance the picture with a portrait of @entity69 ) , he was paid his full fee , then barred from the site			2
the mural was immediately covered , and months later , workers were ordered to destroy the piece altogether			2
it was n't long before the artist got his revenge			2
later that year , @entity2 re-created the piece for the @entity79 in @entity80			2
only this time , he added a portrait to the capitalist side ; it was of @entity29 , holding a martini glass , under a swarm of syphilitic bacteria			2
@entity0 : 5 geniuses who renounced their work 2			2
@entity90 's " @entity89 " the moral : if you 're going to put the mayor on a pedestal , do n't build that pedestal with @entity96			1
in 1978 , after mayor @entity98 and city supervisor @entity99 were assassinated , the city of @entity12 wanted to commemorate its fallen leaders			2
officials set about building a new convention center in @entity98 's honor , and held a competition for a proper memorial sculpture to be displayed in the lobby			2
artist @entity90 quickly won over the selection committee with his proposal for a grinning , oversize bust of the slain mayor			2
but when the sculpture was unveiled in 1981 , it was met with gasps of horror			2
the audience was n't shocked by @entity98 's smiling head , but by its nearly 5 - foot - tall pedestal , which was imprinted with five bloody bullet holes and graffiti that read " @entity122 " and " @entity123			2
" @entity90 even included an image of a revolver and a twinkie -- a reference to the assassin , @entity129 , who 'd tried to exonerate himself in court by arguing that junk food binges were to blame for his violent mood swings			2
@entity90 claimed he was trying to portray the totality of the crime , but @entity137 would n't have it			2
mayor @entity98 's successor , @entity139 , denounced the work , and the city demanded its money back			0
a handful of people did appreciate the sculpture , though			0
a private collector purchased the piece immediately , and in 1997 , " @entity89 " resold for $ 155,000			0
today , even @entity139 agrees the work would be " appropriate for a museum			0
" just do n't count on it showing up in the @entity153 lobby anytime soon			0
@entity155 's " @entity154 " the moral : founding fathers look less distinguished in the nude			1
in 1832 , @entity159 commissioned a giant sculpture of @entity154 for the 100th anniversary of the president 's birth			1
they tapped artist @entity155 for the job , and he seemed like a perfect fit			0
not only did the @entity168 native come with a great reputation , but he 'd also trained in @entity170 with the best @entity172 artists			1
considering @entity155 's background , @entity159 assumed that his work might be classically influenced			0
what they did n't expect was to see the founding father on a pedestal , almost naked as the day he was born			0
to be fair , @entity155 had good intentions			0
inspired by ancient depictions of @entity183 gods , the artist wanted to portray @entity185 's first president with the strength of @entity187 , bestowing power on the people			0
but when @entity155 unveiled his work in the @entity192 , the audience did n't get it			0
instead of greeting the statue with thunderous applause , onlookers simply gawked and snickered at the half - naked @entity154			1
wrapped loosely in a toga , the president looked out of character with his nipples and belly button exposed			0
worse still , @entity154 's arm was extended outward in a grand gesture , and many in the crowd joked that the embarrassed president was trying to reach for his clothes			1
they tried to relocate the piece , eventually sticking it on the east lawn of the @entity192			0
by 1908 , however , politicians had acquired a sense of humor about the sculpture , and the statue was moved to the @entity215			0
today , it can be seen in all its naked splendor at the @entity218			1
@entity0 : 8 times museum patrons mangled works of art 4			1
@entity223 's " entropa " the moral : not everyone appreciates racist , nationalist humor			1
on january 1 , 2009 , the @entity228 took over the revolving presidency of the @entity230 , and to commemorate the event , the government turned to @entity228 artist @entity223			0
for his piece , @entity232 proposed working with 26 other artists , one from each @entity230 member nation , to create a grand monument			1
but when " entropa " was unveiled on january 12 , the international community was scandalized			0
rather than celebrating @entity172 , " @entity222 " mocked each and every country			0
" @entity222 " is a huge map in which each nation is represented as a stereotype			0
some are silly ; others are blatantly offensive			0
@entity246 is depicted as a @entity248 theme park ; @entity249 is a network of motorways that resembles a swastika ; @entity253 is a large , @entity255 - style box ; @entity256 is a collection of squat toilets			0
upon seeing the work , the @entity256 government immediately issued a formal complaint			0
the controversy grew when newspapers noticed that @entity232 's " team " of international artists was nowhere to be found			1
@entity223 soon admitted that they did n't exist ; his only collaborators were his two assistants			0
outraged , @entity228 officials accused him of misappropriating state funds , but @entity232 insisted that he 'd always intended to return the money			0
three days later , when the work was ceremonially presented to the public , @entity232 formally apologized to the @entity228 government			0
he said his intention was " to see if @entity172 is able to laugh at itself			0
" apparently , it ca n't			0
