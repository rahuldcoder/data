physician @entity7 was confirmed monday night on a 51 - 43 vote despite stiff opposition from the @entity10 , due in large part to @entity2 's unsuccessful maneuver this weekend meant to register @entity14 opposition to @entity16 's executive action on deportations			1
the @entity3 @entity14 kept his colleagues in the @entity19 through saturday , intending to get a vote on whether the president 's move was constitutional			2
with the @entity23 in session , @entity1 were able to clear procedural barriers in the nomination process , originally thought to be too time consuming to finish before the @entity28 recess			1
@entity2 's keeping the @entity23 open allowed @entity1 to clear those steps on a number of presidential nominees , some of them controversial , making it easier for them to win final confirmation this week			0
