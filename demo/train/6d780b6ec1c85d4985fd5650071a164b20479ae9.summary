@entity0 , @entity1 -- homeland security secretary @entity4 has ordered an investigation after a man who was in the @entity7 illegally killed a nun in a car crash , authorities said			1
@entity10 is trying determine why the man was still in the country because he had been arrested two previous times for drunken driving offenses			1
the suspect , @entity16 , driving sunday morning under the influence of alcohol , slammed head - on into three nuns in a @entity22 sedan , police said			1
the three were just a few miles from a monastery in @entity0 , @entity1 , heading for their annual retreat			1
sister @entity27 was killed instantly , and the other two remained hospitalized tuesday			1
the suspect has twice been in custody -- the first time , almost two years ago in october 2008 -- @entity32 officials said			1
but both times , @entity16 was released on his own recognizance pending deportation proceedings , because he was not convicted of a violent felony such as murder , rape , or robbery			1
" he was in removal proceedings , " @entity10 told @entity2 on tuesday			1
" why were the removal proceedings taking so long ? i do not obviously as of today have the results of that , but i will get them			1
" @entity45 , chairman of the prince william county board of supervisors , said he was furious with how immigration officials have handled the case			1
" we identified him as an illegal alien , we told @entity32 that he had twice been convicted now of @entity52 's , that he posed a threat to the community , " said @entity45			2
" and they turned around and they released him right back into the neighborhood			2
" county prosecutor @entity58 said @entity16 has previously been convicted twice for drunken driving , as well as reckless driving , speeding , and public drunkenness			2
he spent 20 days in jail in 2009			2
the suspect , 23 , has now been charged with involuntary manslaughter			1
it was unclear if he has retained a defense lawyer			2
the incident comes amid a contentious national debate about illegal immigration , just days after a strict new immigration law was scheduled to go into effect in @entity73			2
the most controversial provisions of the law have been stayed by a judge , but supporters of the law said a failure by @entity80 to crack down on illegal immigration forced @entity73 to act			0
the @entity82 says record numbers of immigrants who have committed crimes have been removed in the last 18 months			0
" this administration has fundamentally reformed immigration enforcement , " said spokesman @entity86 , " identifying and removing criminal aliens who pose a threat to public safety			0
" but @entity45 said more needs to be done			0
" @entity94 has deliberately understaffed and underfunded immigration enforcement for years , " @entity45 said			0
on tuesday , the @entity1 monastery 's chapel was adorned with flowers , and a vigil and funeral are scheduled for later this week			0
@entity27 , the victim in the car accident , had served as a missionary in @entity103 , and regularly acted as a spiritual mentor to the 30 other nuns at the convent			0
" it 's a great loss , because they depended on her , " said sister @entity107			0
but the convent said in a statement , " the @entity113 are dismayed and saddened that this tragedy has been politicized , and become an apparent forum for the illegal immigration agenda			0
" @entity107 said she would rather focus on the needless tragedies caused by drinking and driving , and on forgiveness , in memory of @entity27			0
" if she had been conscious at the time that she was taken from the wreck , " she said , " if @entity16 had been there , she would have said , ' @entity16 , i forgive you			0
' " @entity2 's @entity127 contributed to this report .			0
