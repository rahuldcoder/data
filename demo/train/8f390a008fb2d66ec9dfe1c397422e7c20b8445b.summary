-- after a year of tumultuous weather and global change , it should not be surprising that 2012 proved to be a transformative period for public opinion on energy			1
changing attitudes on the most hotly debated topics matter a great deal because they set the course for future policy decisions			2
taking a closer look at trends over the past 12 months hints at what to expect in several key areas of the @entity17 energy landscape in 2013			1
natural gas boom -- and controversy hydraulic fracturing , also known as " fracking , " has been around for more than half a century , but recently expanded rapidly because of advances in horizontal drilling deep underground			1
despite this proliferation of new wells , 59 % of @entity17 say they are unfamiliar with the term , down from 63 % in march , according to the latest findings from the @entity28 at @entity30 's @entity29			0
although the majority still does not seem to know much about fracking , a deluge of media attention to this controversial extraction technology has likely raised its profile significantly since last year			2
however , increased awareness is not synonymous with public approval			2
among those familiar with hydraulic fracturing , support decreased from 48 % to 41 % over six months			0
similarly , a december poll by @entity43 reported that 66 % of @entity17 would like greater government oversight of the process , up from 56 % in september			0
when @entity47 's new film " @entity48 " debuts in january , expect public recognition and heated debate over hydraulic fracturing to rise further			2
climate change gets real when gov. @entity59 quipped , " president @entity52 promised to begin to slow the rise of the oceans " at the @entity55 , his audience burst into laughter			1
during the debates that followed , neither party 's nominee mentioned climate change once as a policy priority			1
weeks later , @entity64 ravaged the @entity65 , flooding many parts of @entity67 , @entity68 and other regions along the @entity70			0
both candidates immediately canceled campaign events in the wake of the storm and mayor @entity75 endorsed president @entity52 , citing his commitment to tackling climate change			1
after a summer of record - breaking drought followed by this single powerful hurricane in a major metropolitan area , attitudes shifted			1
in march , 65 % of @entity17 surveyed said they thought that climate change was occurring			1
by september , after the summer drought , that number reached 73 % , with the greatest gains among republicans and independent voters			0
earlier this month , the @entity88 - @entity87 poll followed up , reporting that after @entity64 , 78 % of @entity17 now say global temperatures are rising			0
because weather can influence opinions on climate change , it 's possible that a wet and stormy winter -- ironically , also exacerbated by climate change -- could push attitudes in the other direction			1
regardless , in 2013 expect to hear less argument about whether the @entity98 is warming and a more serious policy discussion by elected officials across levels of government about how we might mitigate the effects of rising seas , changing ocean acidity , agricultural uncertainty and extreme weather events			0
renewables gain ground renewable energy technologies have been available for decades , but 2012 may have been the tipping point for their wider adoption			1
there has been a significant increase in the percentage of @entity17 who say they are likely to buy hybrid or electric vehicles or use " smart " electric meters within the next five years			0
most notably , between september 2011 and september 2012 , the percentage of @entity17 who say they are likely to install solar panels at home increased from 21 % to 28 %			2
these trends may reflect changing attitudes on climate , media attention to energy during the election cycle , rising gas prices or cheaper , widely advertised new alternatives			1
most likely , it 's a combination of all these			0
what 's clear is that we are now on the cusp of a renewables revolution with greater options and cost - saving technologies than ever			0
they are finally becoming more affordable , reliable and practical , with solar power at the helm			0
still , it 's important to note that as we ring in 2013 , @entity140 , not the @entity65 , has taken the lead on renewables			0
the big picture polls tell the story of how attitudes are shifting , but short of having a crystal ball , there is no way to unequivocally predict what major world events will influence our nation 's energy future			2
for example , another nuclear disaster or offshore oil spill could play an enormous role in shaping the next generation of energy priorities			0
what can we count on in 2013 ? in the past year , the percentage of @entity17 saying they consider themselves knowledgeable on how energy is produced , delivered and used has increased from 24 % to 33 %			1
more are likely to seek added information about reducing their own energy use and a higher percentage rate energy issues as important to them			1
amid economic uncertainty , volatile prices and global unrest , @entity17 are paying closer attention to the energy decisions that affect us all			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			2

public attitudes shifted on key energy issues in 2012
@entity178 says controversy has grown over natural gas fracking boom
she says climate change , renewable energy are likely to be on agenda for 2013
