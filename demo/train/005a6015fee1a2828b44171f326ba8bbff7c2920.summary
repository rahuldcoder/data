here is @entity2 's response to comments on the essay he wrote after learning his father was going to become a woman			1
friday night my dad came down from @entity9 to watch her name was @entity12 -- the @entity14 documentary about him -- with our family and some friends			1
it meant a lot to me and my mother that my dad was down at our house , in the room much less where all of this first happened			1
my dad , my mother , some neighborhood friends and my girlfriend @entity28 all sat down saturday night to watch it			1
the next day my dad showed me some of the comments on the @entity14 web site about the essay i wrote about him in 8th grade for a school project			1
these comments were some of the nicest things i 've read about myself in my life			1
as people saw my posting , they started asking me some questions			2
one good question was : " how did my schoolmates react to all of this ? were they supportive or negative towards this ? " well , the night my dad told me about his plans to become a woman was also the same night that the news stations found out and aired the story			1
surprisingly to my parents , i decided to go to school the next day			2
i went to a small school at the time			2
it was a school with grades 4 - 8 and had about 300 kids total			2
i was in the 8th grade			2
as i got dropped off , before i could even walk in the school , some teachers and a bunch of my friends came running out to hug me and say it 's going to be okay			1
i was still in shock from all of this , but i 'm pretty good at hiding my emotions			2
unfortunately having all of your friends hugging you and knowing about this brought out some tears			2
all of my 8th grade friends knew about this , and mostly all of them were supportive			2
now i 'm in the 10th grade at high school with about 3000 students , so it 's a bit different			1
when i started high school , the story of my dad had kind of settled down			0
i 've not really gotten any support from my new high school friends because we do n't talk about it			0
i 've been asked a few times if @entity90 was related to me and i say , " yes , that 's my dad			1
" other than about three of those little " are - you - related " questions from people i partially knew , i have n't been approached by any kids at school			0
yes , some people tell me that my dad is kind of weird and i completely agree			0
when you truly love someone you learn to accept the choices they make			0
it 's no different if your mom said , " i am going to shave off all my hair			1
" would you stop loving her because of that ? hopefully not			0
this is the same thing with my dad , but its i obviously a little more than a haircut			0
one of the comments that i read was that it was selfish for my dad to use the money on his surgery			1
was it selfish of my dad ? absolutely -- 100 percent -- not			0
if you had those feelings , i am sure all of us would do the same thing			0
it would be almost rude to live the rest of his life in pain knowing he was n't himself and not truly who he felt he was			0
money was always a problem ever since my dad got fired			0
like i said in the documentary , the biggest negative change that impacted our family was dad losing his job			0
i know that if we were really down to the last dollars we had , my dad would not have done the surgery until we got back on our feet			0
both of my parents are really financially smart and we have planned ahead to live a comfortable life			0
the more important part is me and my mom still live in our house			0
i 've lived in this house since i was a baby and i ca n't imagine having to move			0
in conclusion , i would like to thank everyone who read my essay			1
the comments i read about myself are some of the nicest things i have ever read about me			1
i love the feedback that i get , good or bad			1
