@entity0 -- five former @entity4 security guards , indicted in a 2007 shooting incident in @entity6 that left 17 @entity7 dead , will surrender to the @entity8 on monday , a source told @entity1 on saturday			1
an @entity7 woman looks at a blood - stained car of two women killed in the 2007 @entity13 shooting			1
the men were identified as @entity15 , 26 , of @entity16 , @entity17 ; @entity18 , 27 , of @entity19 , @entity20			2
; @entity21 , 26 , of @entity22 , @entity23 ; @entity24 , 25 , of @entity25 , @entity20 ; and @entity26 , 29 , of @entity27 , @entity28			0
all have served in the military			0
two people with knowledge of the case said friday that a sixth security guard is in plea negotiations			1
the exact charges handed up by a federal grand jury this week were not revealed , because the indictment remains under court seal			2
it could be made public by @entity41 officials monday			1
sources have said that charges under consideration included murder and assault			2
the @entity41 had no comment on the development friday			0
the @entity49 , which employed @entity4 to protect @entity51 diplomats and other employees , also had no comment			2
@entity4 declined to comment until an official announcement is made			1
@entity4 has been told by the government that the company will not face charges , according to several sources			1
" we strongly disagree with the @entity41 's decision to bring charges against @entity18 , " attorney @entity59 said in a statement			2
" any charges brought against mr. @entity18 are wrong and unjust			0
" @entity26 's attorney , @entity65 , said he is " an honorable young man who served this country with distinction for many years			0
" @entity1 was attempting to contact attorneys for the other men saturday			0
the six guards were informed during the summer that they were targets of the investigation into the september 16 , 2007 , shooting in a @entity6 intersection			1
@entity4 claims that its employees were returning fire after coming under attack from insurgents , but an @entity7 investigation called the killings " premeditated murder			1
" none of the guards has worked for @entity4 since 2007 , company spokeswoman @entity83 said			1
" on september 16 , 2007 , at @entity87 , @entity4 security guards were defending themselves and their comrades who were being shot at and receiving fire from @entity7 they believed to be enemy insurgents , in a place where the enemy has made a major city , @entity6 , the battlefield , " @entity59 said			1
" because of that and because of the deceptive tactics used by these insurgents against @entity51 , civilian casualties tragically occur			0
" we have been and remain determined and prepared to fight these charges , and we are confident that @entity18 will be vindicated			0
" the complex legal case has been dogged by difficulties and may present a major challenge to federal prosecutors			0
among the potential problems is that the law under which the charges are expected to be brought covers contractors working for the @entity51 military , but the @entity4 guards were contracted by the @entity49			1
some independent legal experts have questioned whether @entity51 courts would have jurisdiction in this type of case			0
also muddying the case are assurances of immunity initially given to the guards by @entity49 diplomatic security agents , who were investigating the incident before the @entity8 tried to interview them when it took over the investigation			0
the @entity49 maintains that its agents did not offer blanket immunity from criminal prosecution but only promised that the statements the guards made on the scene could not be used against them in any prosecution			2
but when the investigation was turned over to the @entity41 to examine possible criminal activity , @entity8 agents discovered that some guards believed they were immune from prosecution and therefore refused to be interviewed again , complicating the @entity8 investigation			0
the indictments come within days of a new @entity141 , which pointedly specifies that @entity51 civilian contractors will no longer be immune from @entity7 prosecution for crimes committed in that country			2
the @entity49 renewed @entity4 's contract this year over strong objections from the @entity7 government			1
@entity1 's @entity149 and @entity150 contributed to this report .			0
