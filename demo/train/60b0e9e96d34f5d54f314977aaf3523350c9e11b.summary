@entity0 -- as the dust settles from a third -- more effective and yet miniaturized -- @entity6 nuclear test , the question rings out : what do they want ? what are the intentions of @entity11 , the newest , and youngest incarnation of the @entity13 ? the timing is of course , everything			0
setting the test for the day of president @entity18 's @entity20 address is not random luck			1
it puts pressure exactly where pressure is wanted : in @entity25			0
as the @entity27 doubtless received the news in the early hours of the morning , they would have been scrambling to find out what they do know			0
they will also have been fending off calls from the media along with more than a few concerned senators and congressmen			0
the message from the latter will no doubt have sounded something like the following , " what are you doing about this ? " the call will be to act , but how , what , and where ? doubtless the @entity18 team will be as stumped as the many agitated diplomats rushing around the @entity49 @entity48			1
of course , the @entity51 envoys at the @entity48 will be concerned , but unlike their @entity53 , @entity54 , and @entity55 colleagues , they 'll probably remain seated			1
they 'll have firm orders from @entity57 to keep emotions from boiling over			2
they may even water the sanctions down			0
as if they needed to			0
any sanctions imposed would doubtless lose meaning as the morning trains began their daily shipment of goods and fuel across the border from @entity51 into @entity6			2
@entity69 , @entity51 's new leader , may want a " new relationship " with the @entity55 , but that does n't mean that @entity25 's strategic concerns are @entity51 's			1
and if we did n't already know what @entity74 wants , the @entity18 team will no doubt be consulting its army of @entity6 - watchers from the @entity78 , the @entity79 and the @entity80 for a consensus			1
according to many observers i 've spoken to over the years , @entity6 wants the following ( in order of importance ) : ( 1 ) regime survival ; ( 2 ) acceptance as a nuclear power by the @entity55 ; ( 3 ) a peace treaty between the @entity55 and @entity6 ; ( 4 ) trade and economic growth on their terms , and hey , if we can ( 5 ) @entity6 unification under @entity74 's benign rule			1
of course , @entity18 's team will have been told about the " provocation cycle , " that unfortunate fact that the @entity55 and its allies will sit down to the table with @entity6 within six months of any provocation			1
why will they do it ? because of the heat generated within @entity25 , the demands to " do something , " and to allay regional fears that @entity109 's defenses are n't what they used to be			2
so what can the @entity18 team do if sanctions are ineffective , and if a military response is out of the question ? they can learn the art of pressure from their opponents on this			1
but , of course , the question is what makes @entity74 squirm ? it clearly is n't sanctions on luxury goods , as these have failed to deter endless missile tests			0
the answer to that riddle lies in the recent history of the @entity131 , in which we learned the impact of free information on @entity136 citizens behind the @entity137			1
information is the greatest weapon at the disposal of the @entity18 team , and they should apply it liberally			1
the @entity6 people are their greatest ally and should be messaged accordingly			0
according to a 2011 report on @entity6 susceptibility to outside media , radio and dvds are the most common way for normal @entity6 to hear media from the outside world			0
the @entity18 team should not look to its diplomats in @entity153 for salvation , but rather to @entity78 and to the @entity55 military 's best and brightest on the @entity155			1
each time @entity74 ratchets up the pressure , @entity25 should reply in kind by smuggling in 150,000 dvds about the free world outside @entity6 's humble borders			0
radio stations should work overtime to bring impartial news about the world to the hapless citizens , who still live in the @entity131 , while the rest of us move on			2
let 's not let the pressure be one way			0
@entity55 newspapers and senators may tremble about a @entity6 nuclear - tipped bomb , but certainly young @entity11 must tremble too at the prospect of his citizens awash in the streets , their eyes open to the nature of their lot			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			0

@entity184 : test on day of @entity18 's @entity20 address not by luck
*spotlight* on what @entity51 does , but @entity57 does n't share @entity55 strategic view
" information is the greatest weapon at the disposal of the @entity18 team "
" free information " had huge impact on @entity136 citizens during @entity131
