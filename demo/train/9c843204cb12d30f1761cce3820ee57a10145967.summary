" in a separate letter addressed to the kingdom 's interior minister , prince @entity50 , the group asked the minister to " provide us the opportunity to peacefully express our demand for political reform , on the basis of the requirements of the allegiance : the stewardship of the nation over the ruler			0
because it is the only way to ensure the means to , and the guarantees of , justice and democracy			0
" the letter detailed how , if permission were granted to stage the sit - in , the attendees would " express their feelings peacefully in a very civilized and polite manner			2

@entity72 said that even though @entity10 was denied a permit for the planned sit - in , he does see positive signs in all this			1
" given the fact that we have been reiterating the same demands before and that we 're still free to meet and discuss all this , it 's a good indication of how times have changed for the better , " said @entity72			2
he attributed a lot of the newfound tolerance in @entity2 to its ruler , @entity108 , who is seen by many as a reformer and who has been promoting national and societal dialogue within the kingdom since ascending the throne in 2005			0
" if you think about the atmosphere in the country 10 years ago , " explained @entity72 , " nobody could have put these demands on the table then -- so now , it seems @entity2 has opened up a bit			0

the @entity10 wanted to stage a public sit - in
it 's the third time the group applied for and was denied a permit for peaceful assembly
there are positive signs , though , because the group can still " meet and discuss "
