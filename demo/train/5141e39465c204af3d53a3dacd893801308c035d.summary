federal agents on tuesday raided a @entity2 office of dr. @entity3 , an eye doctor whose past issues with authorities had already entangled sen. @entity6			1
with yellow crime tape strung up outside , men and women lugged box after box of materials from @entity3 's @entity14 office into awaiting minivans			2
both members of the federal @entity18 department and the @entity19 took part in the search , which @entity19 special agent @entity22 said was the second at the same @entity25 clinic -- the other coming last january			0
" as this is part of an ongoing investigation , ( authorities have ) no further comment / information at this time , " said @entity22			0
that means no official details as to what authorities were looking for			0
even if it has nothing to do with his record as a generous political donor , tuesday 's raid suggests @entity3 's legal troubles and perhaps their negative impact on @entity6 , the senior @entity36 senator from @entity37 are far from over			1
confessions show sex claims were ' false smears , ' senator says the doctor 's lawyer contended that tuesday 's search was the government 's way of getting back at @entity3 , after he sued over @entity54 payments			1
even so , @entity55 , the attorney , said that @entity3 will continue to work with authorities			0
" while we believe that today 's intrusion was in retaliation and there was no legitimate need for the search , the @entity19 's actions will not prevent dr. @entity3 from continuing his full cooperation with the government , " @entity55 said			2
the doctor first came to the attention of many around @entity70 when @entity71 , a conservative website , published a report shortly before the november 2012 election citing several @entity76 women who claimed they 'd had sex with @entity6 for money			0
the @entity37 @entity79 staunchly denied the accusation			0
and in march , @entity76 police announced three women had been paid to claim -- falsely -- that they had sex with @entity6			2
while that part of the story died down , the episode raised questions about why and how @entity6 admittedly flew to the @entity76 three times in 2010 on @entity3 's private plane			1
one of those flights was on official business , while two others were for private reasons			0
the now two - term @entity36 senator -- following his re-election last fall -- personally paid @entity3 approximately $ 58,500 for the flights , admitting he had failed to pay in more timely , proper payments because " it unfortunately fell through the cracks			2
" others have also brought up how @entity6 raised concerns regarding a federal audit that showed @entity3 had overbilled the federal government by $ 8.9 million in @entity54 and @entity106 payments when treating patients			1
@entity3 , his wife @entity108 and his daughter @entity109 have been generous donors to @entity6 , his fellow @entity111 and related causes in recent years			2
yet in an interview last spring with @entity114 , @entity3 insisted that he " did not ask sen. @entity6 or any public official to intervene			1
" in the same interview , the doctor said he and @entity6 had " become like brothers , like friends , " talking to each other every week and seeing each other once a month until the first news broke			0
the matter of @entity3 's billing practices , meanwhile , has taken more twists and turns in recent months			1
the doctor sued the federal government in august related to his @entity54 claims , with authorities asking to suspend his @entity54 payments three weeks later , according to @entity3 's lawyer			1
just last friday , @entity3 filed a motion seeking an injunction to stop the government .			0

federal agents raid @entity2 clinic of dr. @entity3 for the second time
they do *n't* say why , but @entity3 is being probed for @entity54 billing practices
he 's also been a donor to sen. @entity6 , who questioned an audit into @entity3
@entity6 flew on @entity3 's plane , paid him back after the fact
