-- @entity2 's @entity1 on tuesday denied the @entity5 clerk 's request to immediately halt same - sex marriages in the state , the latest , if not necessarily last , key ruling in a years - long legal fight			1
the decision was announced in a brief ruling , which said : " the request for an immediate temporary stay or injunctive relief is denied			0
" @entity15 , @entity2 's attorney general , also tweeted the news			2
she is among the state officials who have supported same - sex marriage and opposed the implementation of @entity20 , a referendum that limited marriages in the state to those between a man and a woman			2
the @entity26 @entity1 paved the way last month for gay and lesbian couples to resume marrying in the state			1
in a lengthy court document filed last friday with @entity2 's @entity1 , @entity5 clerk @entity30 asked the court to order gov. @entity33 , @entity34 and other state officials to abide by an " immediate temporary stay " to once again halt same - sex marriages			1
" petitioner has been placed in an unsustainable position because , among other things , he has been threatened with legal action by the attorney general for exercising his public duties consistent with state law defining marriage as the union between one man and one woman , " @entity30 argued			0
earlier tuesday -- before the state high court 's decision came down -- same - sex marriage supporters gathered in @entity5 to decry the efforts by @entity30 and his supporters to continue their fight			2
" your religion , i respect it , i do n't agree with it , " lgbt rights activist @entity56 said			0
" but my religion and your religion do not run this land			0
the @entity64 of the @entity26 runs this land			0
" at one point , @entity30 himself came out to make his case , addressing reporters as his opponents stood around him			0
the clerk said he wanted @entity2 's @entity1 to halt same - sex marriages because of what had happened once before : such weddings took place only to be later ruled to be against state law			1
" i asked for a stay because it 's cruel to set up people , " the county clerk said			1
the back - and - forth over same - sex marriage in @entity2 has been playing out in the courts and in political forums for years			2
fast facts : same - sex marriage in may 2008 , @entity2 's @entity1 struck down the state 's ban on same - sex marriage , ruling that the state 's constitution gives " this basic civil right to ( marry to ) all @entity2 , whether gay or heterosexual , and to same - sex couples as well as to opposite - sex couples			1
" the tide turned a few months later , when 52 % of voters backed @entity20 to halt gay and lesbian marriages			0
yet state officials declined to stand behind the prohibition , even if private parties did			0
a federal appeals court subsequently ruled that @entity20 was unconstitutional , though it still issued a stay on same - sex marriages until the @entity26 @entity1 could weigh in			1
that happened june 26 , when the nation 's high court -- in a 5 - 4 decision -- dismissed an appeal of the earlier lower court ruling on narrow , jurisdictional grounds			0
high court lets same - sex marriages in @entity2 continue two days later , the @entity112 officially lifted the previous injunction and same - sex weddings took place very soon thereafter			1
@entity20 backers tried to get the @entity26 @entity1 to again intervene , but justice @entity117 refused to do so			2
since filing his petition , @entity30 has become a champion for those who favor restricting marriage to heterosexuals			0
in a tweet several days ago , for instance , the @entity124 's @entity123 compared the county clerk to civil rights icon @entity128 for refusing " to violate @entity2 constitution on wedding licenses			1
" gay rights groups , like @entity133 , cheered tuesday 's decision denying @entity136 's request			1
still , @entity137 reported that the long , winding legal battle has n't necessarily come to an end			1
" it 's not over ! " tweeted that organization , which describes itself as " a proud member of the @entity5 lgbt community			0
" " @entity144 still has to has to hear petitions to halt same - gender marriage in august			0

new : gay rights groups cheer the ruling , while adding the legal battle is n't necessarily over
