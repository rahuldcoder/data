-- actress @entity1 volunteers regularly with @entity2 , an organization that enables actors , artists and musicians to share their talents with children who are battling serious medical conditions			1
she was also a presenter at " @entity9 : an all - star tribute " in 2009			1
@entity12 recently sat down to talk to @entity0 producer @entity13 about @entity9 and her philanthropy			1
below are excerpts from that interview			2
@entity13 : what inspired you to get involved with the art of @entity21 ? @entity1 : i 'm a sucker for kids , and i also know the importance of art and what it can do to someone 's life			1
coming from a low - income family , i did n't know that art was this release ... so it 's really important for me to make sure that kids know : " you have a voice			1
you can put this to paper			2
... you can put this to canvas			2
" what we do is we bring the arts , in any way we can , into hospitals			1
some of these children have been bedridden for years , so they obviously ca n't go out and play			1
we read to the children			1
we finger - paint -- that 's a really fun one -- and it 's amazing what you see			1
you get a real direct , immediate result			2
these children , they 're just these beautiful little souls			1
some of these kids ca n't speak , so they really just have their eyes and their souls to communicate			1
and when you finger - paint with a kid or you dance and you see their little eyes light up , it 's pretty incredible			1
and when you start visiting them on a regular basis , you see their growth			0
it 's really quite special			0
@entity13 : has there been a particular child who inspired you ? @entity12 : @entity73 is one of the most creative souls i 've ever met			1
he ends up writing a play every year for @entity77 , and we end up all acting in it			0
@entity73 has now written three plays for me			0
he 's a demanding director			0
@entity73 's face is completely deformed , and he has a lot of internal problems and health issues due to his deformities			0
he 's this awesome kid who 's found a purpose and who 's found a voice through the art of @entity21			1
@entity13 : it sounds like you 're pretty involved			0
@entity12 : i would love to say that i give selflessly , but that 's not true ; what i get back is tenfold			1
my vocabulary does n't even contain the words i feel once i leave the hospital			2
there is total sense of purpose and fulfillment that i feel that i do n't get from any other area of my life			2
it 's a two - way deal			2
it 's just so gratifying			0
@entity13 : do you have any heroes ? what is a hero to you ? @entity12 : charity and giving back begins at home , and that is really important to remember			1
you can be out there saving the world , but if you 're not trying to save your own family and doing the work at home , it does n't really make any sense			2
you asked me who my hero is -- my mom			0
she is a survivor in every sense of the word , and it began at home with her			0
she is a very compassionate woman , and she always taught me to think about other people			0
as bad as things were for us , there was always someone who was worse off			0
that always put me in a state of gratitude , and i thank her for that			0
but that , to me , is a hero			0
a woman who is a survivor and does n't let life beat them down			2
@entity13 : moving onto @entity9 , you were a presenter at " @entity9 : an all - star tribute " last year			1
how did that compare to other awards shows you 've been to ? @entity12 : can i say a bad word ? it was n't full of s ---			1
i left that night feeling like i wanted to change the world right then and there			0
it was beautiful because you have all of these people coming together , swapping stories and ideas			0
it was just amazing to have all of these " good - doers " in one room together			2
it 's a lot of power			0
it 's a lot of energy , and that 's inspiring			0
@entity13 : what was it like to see all of those heroes ? how did it affect you personally ? @entity12 : it makes me realize that , due to this celebrity thing , i do have a light that follows me around			1
so what i choose to do with that light is shine it on other things that are important , not just what i 'm wearing			0
... so it just keeps everything in perspective and makes me realize my purpose as well and the purpose of this crazy thing called celebrity .			0
