@entity69 had high praise for @entity7 's maneuvering of the twin - engine plane			1
" @entity7 learned to fly that plane in 20 minutes , " @entity69 said			1

" and it 's real quiet in that airplane when nobody 's talking to you			0
" his teenage daughter @entity113 said she felt helpless			0
" i mean , what could i do ? nothing , just sit there and pray and , you know , throw up , " she said			0
