the @entity3 @entity2 , led by the pub - clubbable @entity0 , has won a resounding second successive parliamentary by - election and sent @entity3 politics tumbling into an abyss of the unknown			1
@entity9 , the former @entity10 politician who left the party for @entity2 in september , won back his seat in @entity13 thursday in the @entity14 and @entity15 by - election that was triggered by his defection			1
@entity2 is now more than just a fringe group thumbing its nose at the big parties : it is a wild card which can threaten all their prospects			2
few political experts would claim at this moment to be able to predict the outcome of the next general election , which will take place on may 7 , 2015			1
and nobody knows how many of the protest votes @entity2 has been gathering will stay with them when voters are deciding who will govern the country			0
but @entity2 are still advancing : back in may , they won the @entity38 elections with 27 percent of the votes and 24 seats , the first time a party other than @entity42 or the @entity10 has done so			2
what seems almost inevitable is that there will be another " hung " @entity13 after the general election -- meaning no party will win an outright majority of seats			1
but this time neither conservatives nor @entity42 look like being able to build a coalition government without doing deals with more than one other political grouping			0
@entity3 is likely to experience an unstable era of @entity55 - style politics where the chief preoccupation of the political class is not solving the problems of the nation , but putting together deals to enable any decisions to be taken at all			0
reckless was the second former @entity10 to resign his seat and win his way back to @entity13 in the purple colors of @entity2 after @entity67 had done the same in @entity69 in october			1
and although his roughly 3,000 vote majority will be less sustainable at a general election than @entity67 's crushing victory , it keeps @entity2 on track for its ambition of winning enough seats next may to hold the balance of power			1
in @entity14 , @entity2 managed to resist a huge @entity10 campaign that included five visits from prime minister @entity81 , who was desperate to stave off another @entity2 victory that could call his effectiveness as the leader of the @entity85 into question			1
@entity2 also won over a significant proportion of the former working class @entity42 vote -- aided by a @entity42 front - bencher 's online posting of a photo of a house in @entity14 draped in @entity95 flags with a white van in the driveway			2
politicians of all stripes were quick to pounce on shadow attorney general @entity101 's ill - judged tweet as snobbish and derogatory , and @entity101 resigned her position before the night was over			0
@entity2 also reduced the @entity104 vote to a derisory figure : some of their former protest votes on the @entity109 are now going to the @entity110			2
the @entity2 bandwagon is still rolling			2
reckless was a confused candidate who at one stage was slapped down by @entity0 for suggesting that @entity116 immigrants might be sent home , but the party that secured a mere three percent at the last general election in @entity3 has become a significant political player			2
it is now the obvious receptacle for protest votes in the way that the @entity104 used to be			0
but their participation in a coalition government with the @entity10 has shredded the @entity104 ' political appeal			0
@entity2 has successfully harnessed to its bandwagon to the common feeling of disillusion with the two major parties and the @entity134 " establishment			1
" as well as its anti-european stance , it has profited from bringing immigration to the fore as a political issue			0
this has spooked lawmakers in other parties who have demanded that their own party leaders must also get tougher on immigration -- a policy area on which few deal in facts but on which much emotion is expended			0
but the more that @entity42 and the @entity85 rush out new immigration policies , the more the public say : " we thought you told us that @entity2 were a bunch of fruitcakes , but now you are agreeing they were right all along			0
" political strategists used to believe that @entity2 were chiefly a threat to the @entity10 , taking the votes of right - wing euroskeptics away from them			2
but in the recent @entity161 and @entity162 by - election in the greater @entity165 area @entity2 came within a few hundred votes of grabbing a @entity42 seat too			1
with the resurgent @entity168 threatening to grab 30 of @entity42 's 40 @entity170 seats in the @entity13 , and @entity42 's leader @entity171 proving the lowest - rated occupant of his position in polling history , @entity42 too are shivering at the @entity2 intervention			0
so where do we go from here ? @entity2 will revel in its triumph and redouble its efforts to entice more @entity181 conservative mps to jump ship in order to save their seats at the next election			0
@entity81 , his authority badly dented after he promised to throw the kitchen sink at saving the @entity14 seat , will be under massive pressure from his mps to turn the political tide now with the major speech he has for some time been promising on immigration ( and which he postponed for fear of having the @entity14 result taken as a verdict on his efforts )			1
he is handicapped because the @entity10 ' pledge to reduce immigration to less than 100,000 a year has failed because of the @entity116 's commitment to the free movement of people within its borders , and @entity207 chancellor @entity206 is heading @entity209 's refusal to reconsider that principle			0
that again plays into @entity2 's hands			0
right - wing euroskeptic conservative mps insist that their party and @entity2 are part of the same political family , and they will now try to pressure @entity81 into some sort of electoral pact -- arguing that otherwise @entity42 will " win " next may 's election with less than a third of the votes			1
@entity81 will resist , but the irony for @entity2 is that of all the possible election results , the only one that will bring about their chief political aim -- an in / out vote on @entity3 's membership in the @entity116 -- is victory for the conservatives who have promised that referendum .			1

@entity10 defector @entity9 brings @entity2 a second by - election win in two months
@entity236 : second successive @entity2 victory makes it hard to predict the winner of *upcoming* general election
@entity236 : reckless ' win an *embarrassing* blow for @entity81 , who threw kitchen sink at winning vote
@entity236 : @entity2 has successfully tied itself to the bandwagon of *popular* *discontent* with " establishment " parties
