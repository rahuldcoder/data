-- the snow - covered mountains tower above the sub-tropical beach , a stunning vista by any standards -- but what sets @entity7 apart from other seaside resorts is its sheer scale of concrete and steel			2
it 's a grand project that @entity13 hopes will transform an ailing region of @entity15 and make a bold statement of intent , using sport as the fulcrum -- much in the way that @entity21 did with its @entity22 in 2008 and @entity23 hopes to do with soccer 's @entity24 in 2020			1
at a reported $ 50 billion and rising , @entity15 's first @entity22 will be the most expensive in history -- topping the eye - watering $ 40 billion @entity28			1
" i 've heard it 's the world 's largest construction site right now , and i can see that , " says @entity30 official @entity29			2
one of the six new stadiums will be used solely for the opening and closing ceremonies			2
" this is quite a national project , not a regional one , " says @entity29 , who was part of a @entity39 delegation to @entity7 last november			1
" you can sense that this is very much on the happening agenda for president @entity13 and the federal government beyond just the organizing committee and the regional area of @entity7			2
this is a big project for @entity15			1
" spiraling costs with a year to go before the @entity51 , much of the @entity50 city is still a mass of scaffolding			2
" the noise of construction is everywhere , " reports @entity0 's @entity54 from @entity7 , which he describes as " a rundown @entity57 - era resort town crippled by terrible traffic			2
" costs have spiraled since @entity15 was awarded the @entity28 in 2007 , and the stakes are high as the @entity64 makes an ambitious flexing of financial muscle that will also include hosting soccer 's @entity24 in 2018			1
on thursday , @entity13 visited @entity7 to see how construction was progressing and unhappy with ballooning costs and that the ski jump facility is two years behind schedule and is still unfinished , reportedly promptly sacked vice-president of @entity15 's @entity73			1
" part of the investment that @entity15 has made is not only what the world will see in @entity15 , but also they 're building a winter paradise that they hope to showcase through the @entity73 broadcast and attract tourism in the future , " says 2010 @entity75 champion @entity74 , who competed at a @entity77 combined skiing test event in @entity7 last weekend			1
" they have not only connected to @entity7 to the mountains by rail , but also @entity7 to the rest of @entity92			2
" @entity13 's spokesman admitted the enormity of the task ahead			2
" it 's a huge challenge , especially for president @entity13 because he uses this @entity22 as a good opportunity for boosting the economy and developing this region of @entity7 , " @entity96 told @entity0			1
it is opening up a resort city where temperatures reach @entity104 in summer , and will be as warm as 10 - @entity105 by the sea when the @entity22 take place from february 7 - 23 next year -- with organizers already stockpiling snow due to sporadic falls , @entity54 says			1
much of the expense is due to the lack of existing infrastructure at the resort , which is an hour and a half 's flight south - west of @entity117 near the border with @entity119 and the disputed territory of @entity121			2
unlike the last @entity51 in @entity75 , which was integrated within the city , @entity7 has had to start from scratch -- new roads , rail , hotels , as well as an improved power grid			0
" i was impressed with the scale of the project and what they are doing there , " says @entity29			2
" uniquely it 's a summer resort town in @entity15 traditionally , not a winter destination , although they have had skiing there a while			1
the juxtaposition of the @entity50 with the mountains behind is quite stunning in its beauty			0
" the @entity73 events will be split between the mountain resort of @entity142 and a purpose - built @entity143 in the city , connected by a 45 - minute high - speed train line			1
criticisms as with any major project , there have been problems			0
@entity150 put out a report the day before the " year to go " milestone claiming that workers have been exploited by the construction companies			0
@entity0 contacted organizers for comment but has not received a response			0
last year 's high - profile alpine skiing test event -- the @entity22 ' glamor sport -- was marred by criticisms of the course			1
" they 're pretty inexperienced there , they never held the @entity24 so it was really rough and really hard , " three - time @entity73 silver medalist @entity162 told @entity0 's @entity164 show			1
" we had huge jumps and after three days of training , i went for a slalom combined run and i 'm skiing down and i feel like something popped in my knee like ' crack ' and i did n't feel any pain so i just carried on skiing , but later i found out that my meniscus was broken			0
" despite such concerns , most skiers have come out in favor of the venue , designed by former skiing great @entity183			0
" @entity186 itself is amazing but the way they set the course last year was not ideal , " says @entity39 @entity73 hopeful @entity185			1
" i think they learned a lot from that @entity24 and i think they 'll open up the course a little bit and make it more like a downhill			0
it was very turny and a lot of guys did n't like that			0
" they did n't ask for feedback but they heard a lot of it from racers and the coaches , and i think they 're listening , so hopefully we 'll have a more open , faster downhill set for the @entity22			1
" @entity185 says @entity210 skiers might find @entity7 more familiar than their @entity212 counterparts			0
" in the @entity213 they do n't get the same kind of snow			0
@entity7 has the mountains like you get in the @entity213 but the snow that you get in the @entity39 and @entity220 -- it 's pretty amazing , " he says			1
" the downhill course is very challenging and it demands the best skier in the world to perform on that day to win			0
i do n't think you 'll see some unknown people doing well , at least in the downhill			0
it 'll take solid skiing from a very good skier to win			0
" sports mad president winning medals is also among the top goals for @entity15 's sports - mad president , who attended a figure skating test event in @entity7 in december			1
" it was exciting , " says @entity210 skater @entity237 , who won the @entity7 grand prix final with his dance partner @entity239			0
" we had heard reports all week that he was there , not there , so in our five - minute warm - up we heard loud applause and we were able to glance up at the videotron at the top and saw that the video was on him			0
" it 's a big deal to be able to perform for such an important figure			0
it 's great that he cares to come and watch			0
i ca n't imagine how nervous i 'd be in front of president @entity256			0
" @entity237 and @entity257 won silver at @entity75 , and the 2011 world champions are coached by @entity15 @entity260			1
" a lot of successful coaches here in the @entity263 have come out of @entity15 and what they have been able to create in the past six or seven years has been really impressive , " added @entity237			1
" for us it 's exciting because at the @entity22 there 's going to be even more buzz			1
they have had teams who have been able to set a new standard for ice dance , they 've had multiple teams like that			0
" collaboration while @entity15 has a rich pedigree in skating , it is still catching up when it comes to alpine skiing			1
so much so the @entity15 have are working with the @entity39 -- despite the countries ' long years of @entity285 opposition			1
" we actually have a partnership with the @entity15 team where we train with them a little bit and share training space and hill space , " says @entity185			2
" their team is definitely building and gaining momentum			0
i 'm not sure where they 'll stack up for the @entity22 but they 're definitely getting stronger			2
" the @entity7 complex is geared towards spectators , according to @entity74 , whose nordic combined event will start and finish at the same stadium -- which will be adapted between the staging of the jumping and cross-country skiing disciplines			0
" the cross-country course is fairly short , 2.5 km , and will loop through the jump stadium twice -- about half the course is visible from the stands , " says @entity74 , adding that a lack of snow was promptly dealt with by event organizers , who had it trucked in			0
" it 's a very modern setup , it 's a very competition - oriented venue			0
it 's going to be great for an @entity73 venue and for international event - hosting for years to come			0
" while @entity39 flocked across the border to @entity220 four years ago , numbers traveling to @entity15 will no doubt be lower -- but the intrigue is building , @entity74 says			1
" i think this will be a new defining moment for , say , the @entity210 public who do n't travel here often or never have -- it will be a window into @entity15 that will define @entity39 ' perspectives for years to come , " he says			1
" i think that perspective has been acknowledged by the organizing committee , and they 're taking it very seriously , not only in the choice of venues but also in what they 're tackling right now -- it 's probably one of the most massive construction projects in history			2

@entity15 will host the @entity22 for the first time next february
it will spend more than $ 50 billion on the most expensive games in history
test events have been held in recent months despite large amount of work to be done
