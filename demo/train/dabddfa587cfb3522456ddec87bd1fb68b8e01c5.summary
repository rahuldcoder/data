@entity0 -- raw video of @entity4 's last days is not covered by laws protecting journalists from court subpoenas , making it likely that @entity9 will have to let lawyers use its video in their defense of dr. @entity13 , a judge said thursday			1
lawyers for @entity13 , who faces trial for involuntary manslaughter in the pop star 's death , argued that the unseen rehearsal video could show that @entity4 was ill and physically weak			1
prosecutors contend that @entity4 died from an overdose of a surgical anesthetic that @entity13 gave him to induce sleep			0
@entity24 , which bought the video from @entity4 's estate , is fighting the subpoena from @entity13 's lawyers for access to about 100 hours of video that was used to produce the " @entity33 " documentary , released several months after the singer 's june 25 , 2009 , death			1
the judge has given the prosecution permission to show clips from the movie to jurors during the trial , which is scheduled to start in september , but the defense wants to use video left on the cutting room floor			0
since @entity9 was under a contractual obligation with the estate to not use anything that showed @entity4 in " a negative light , " the unused video may be helpful to the defense , @entity46 judge @entity45 said			2
the judge gave @entity9 a week to work out technical details with the defense for a way they can view the raw video without the risk of it leaking			1
@entity9 's lawyer said the public release of the raw video could hurt the studio 's plans to use it in other productions , such as an anniversary edition of the documentary			2
" if they become part of the public record as an exhibit , we have a whole different problem , " @entity9 attorney @entity67 said			0
" that would immediately become viral on @entity75 or some other website			0
" defense lawyers were ordered to narrow their subpoena request for the video , which pastor called " remarkably over-broad			2
" @entity4 hired video photographers to record his rehearsals as he prepared for his comeback concerts in @entity84 , scheduled for july 2009			0
his estate later sold the video and documentary rights to @entity9 for about $ 80 million			0
@entity4 was pronounced dead by an emergency room doctor at @entity89			0
the @entity91 coroner ruled that his death was caused by an overdose of propofol , a powerful surgical anesthetic , in combination with " the contributory affects of the benzodiazepines			0
" @entity13 , who was hired as @entity4 's personal doctor in the months leading up to the concert , was later charged with involuntary manslaughter in his death			1
" @entity4 is not with us today because of an utterly inept , incompetent , reckless doctor , the defendant @entity13 , " @entity91 deputy district attorney @entity102 said in his final arguments at @entity13 's preliminary hearing in january			2
@entity13 's lawyers suggested that a frustrated and sleepless @entity4 may have self - ingested the fatal dose while the doctor was out of his bedroom			1
the defense is hoping the raw video will show @entity4 's weakness and frustration as the concert dates neared .			1

dr. @entity13 's lawyers want @entity9 to hand over all raw video of @entity4 's rehearsals
the judge wants the defense to limit its " remarkably over-broad " request
@entity13 's involuntary manslaughter trial for @entity4 's death starts in september
