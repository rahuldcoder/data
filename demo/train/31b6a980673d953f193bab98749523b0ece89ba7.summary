-- a flood of details has emerged in the past 24 hours about the case of @entity4 and the three women police say he held for close to a decade inside his modest @entity8 home			1
based on an initial incident report obtained by @entity0 , we know the women -- @entity4 , 27 ; @entity4 , 23 ; and @entity4 , 32 -- say they were beaten and sexually abused			1
one says she suffered at least five miscarriages induced by starvation and beating			0
and we know they only rarely , and briefly , left the home on @entity17 that had become their prison			0
but some questions remain unanswered in this case			0
here 's a look at a few of them : did anyone know ? and if not , how could that be ? it seems implausible -- three women , and later a child , held captive for close to a decade within a 1,400 - square - foot home in a densely populated urban neighborhood without anyone else knowing			0
would n't his brothers or other relatives , his children -- somebody -- have noticed something strange going on ? at first , authorities seemed to think so : they arrested @entity4 and his two brothers on monday , saying initially that the brothers were linked to the investigation			1
on tuesday , however , they said that did n't seem to be the case			0
one explanation may be @entity4 's penchant for obsessive privacy around his home , according to the father of his late common - law wife			1
@entity51 once shared a home with his daughter , @entity54 , and @entity4			1
@entity54 lived downstairs , the couple lived upstairs			0
@entity4 , he says , would never let anyone visit the second floor			2
and when @entity4 and @entity54 moved to the house on @entity17 -- where the women were later discovered -- @entity4 would n't even let family members through the front door			2
" @entity4 kept everybody at a distance , " said @entity8 deputy police chief @entity62			2
timeline : from missing to liberated could @entity4 be charged with murder ? it 's an intriguing question			1
@entity68 is one of 38 states with a fetal homicide law , according to the @entity72			0
authorities have searched @entity4 's home and found no evidence of human remains			2
but in her initial interview monday with police , @entity4 told investigators that she had suffered at least five miscarriages , according to the incident report obtained by @entity0			2
@entity4 would starve and punch her in the stomach to induce miscarriage , @entity4 said , according to the document			0
authorities have n't publicly discussed such an idea , but @entity0 affiliate @entity88 -- citing multiple law enforcement sources -- said authorities are investigating the possibility of murder charges against @entity4			1
will anyone get the reward ? @entity95 's and @entity4 ' disappearances were frequently in the news , and a $ 25,000 reward was on offer in the case			1
in the immediate aftermath of @entity95 's daring escape , speculation centered on whether @entity4 , one of two neighbors who came to her aid , deserved the reward			1
@entity4 himself suggested the money should go to the women			0
authorities have n't concluded who , if anyone , should get the money , but are discussing it , @entity62 said			0
" that is going to be up to the entities that put up that reward money and what their protocol is , but mr. @entity4 does deserve something			1
a lot of credit and he is the true key to this case , " @entity62 said .			0

did anyone know ?
could @entity4 face murder charges ?
what about the $ 25,000 reward ?
