-- in the glitz and glamor world of @entity4 , image is everything			2
the leading teams such as @entity7 and @entity8 have built formidable reputations off the back of on - track excellence			0
another constructor with a similarly lofty reputation is @entity14 , a team which has origins dating back to a car made by @entity18 @entity17 which first raced in 1948			0
@entity14 went on to win six drivers ' championships and seven constructors ' titles before withdrawing from the elite division of motorsport in 1994 after entering administration			1
the opportunity to reintroduce such an historic name into @entity4 was one not be missed for a businessman looking to put a car on the track			0
@entity34 @entity33 , the owner of @entity36 and @entity37 football team @entity35 , resurrected the name for the 2010 season with the @entity0 - sponsored @entity14			1
but the issue was complicated in 2011 , when the @entity42 team announced a sponsorship deal which would see them renamed as @entity14			1
so how could a situation arise where two teams were competing under the same name ? " last year we had the weird situation where two teams were calling themselves @entity14 , " associate editor of @entity51 @entity50 told @entity0			2
" @entity14 had the naming rights to use the name ' @entity14 '			0
and of course there was @entity42 which was the @entity42 team that was sponsored by @entity14 the car company			1
" a lengthy legal battle ensued , the result of which saw @entity42 buy the @entity14 name from @entity14 who were subsequently rebranded as @entity62			1
but why did both constructors go to such extreme lengths to secure the @entity14 name ? " it 's a huge name in the history of the sport and they wanted to heighten their profile , " explained @entity50			2
" if you 've got a big name you 'll attract the big sponsors			0
" even if @entity14 was n't at the front of the grid last year , they are still going to attract more sponsors than for example @entity77			0
" nobody knows who @entity77 are outside of @entity4 , however i can ask my mother and she knows who @entity14 is and that 's the big difference			1
they can attract the sponsors , they get the money in and from that they can build a stronger team			0
" @entity14 have a rich history in @entity4 , with a list of former drivers which includes @entity95 double world champion @entity94 , @entity98 1970 title winner @entity96 and legendary @entity100 racer @entity99			1
" certainly @entity14 dominated @entity62 to such an extent in the 60s that it became recognised as the place to go to get a quick car , " explained @entity17 's son , @entity101			0
" my father had the reputation for designing fast cars			0
" understandably , @entity42 , now @entity14 , are delighted to have acquired their illustrious name			1
the two men who will be behind the wheel for @entity14 in 2012 are 2007 world champion @entity113 and @entity115 @entity114			2
" we found a great partnership with a brand like @entity14 which has a huge history in @entity4 , " @entity14 chairman @entity116 said			1
" it made a lot of sense for us to take advantage of that			0

two @entity4 teams have fought over the @entity14 name in recent years
@entity14 won seven constructors ' titles and six drivers ' *crowns* before withdrawing in 1994
@entity34 @entity33 reintroduced the @entity14 name with ' @entity14 ' in 2010
@entity42 have been rebranded as @entity14 for 2012 , while @entity14 are now @entity134
