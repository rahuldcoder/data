-- because you were n't going into botany , the priesthood , or coin manufacturing , you thought you were safe to dismiss @entity5 as a dead language			1
obviously , you did n't graduate cum laude			1
i think , therefore i am the famous statue " @entity9 " by @entity11 sculptor @entity10			1
@entity5 is about as dead as @entity12 ( who , by the way , made $ 54 million in 2004 )			1
whether you 're deciphering a cryptic state seal or trying to impress your @entity15 in - laws , knowing some @entity5 has its advantages			1
but the operative word here is " some			1
" the ability to translate the @entity21 probably is n't going to come in handy anytime soon , so we 'll start you off with 9 phrases that have survived the hatchet men of time ( in all their pretentious glory )			1
caveat @entity28 : ( @entity30 - ee - @entity29 ) : " let the buyer beware " before money - back guarantees and 20 - year warranties , caveat emptor was indispensable advice for the consumer			1
these days , it 'd be more fitting to have it tattooed on the foreheads of used - car salesmen , infomercial actors , and prostitutes			1
for extra credit points , remember that caveat often makes solo appearances at cocktail parties as a fancy term for a warning or caution			1
oh , and just so you know , caveat lector means " let the reader beware			1

the term is most commonly used in diplomatic circles to indicate that a person is unwelcome due to ideological differences or a breach of trust			1
sometimes , the tag refers to a pariah , a ne'er - do - well , a killjoy , or an interloper , but it 's always subjective			1
@entity74 was treated as a persona non grata at the @entity76			1
@entity77 would experience the same at @entity78			1
@entity79 : ( hay - bee - as @entity81 - pus ) : " you have the body " when you wake up in the @entity85 after a foggy night at @entity86 , remember this one			2
in a nutshell , habeas corpus is what separates us from savages			2

it 's also one of the cornerstones of the @entity102 and @entity103 legal systems			2
without it , tyrannical and unjust imprisonments would be possible			2
in situations where national security is at risk , however , habeas corpus can be suspended			2
@entity111 - go some ) : " i think , therefore i am " when all those spirited mental wrestling matches you have about existentialism start growing old ( yeah , right ! ) , you can always put an end to the debate with cogito ergo sum			2

@entity162 ) : " you scratch my back , i 'll scratch yours " given that quid pro quo refers to a deal or trade , it 's no wonder the @entity169 nicknamed their almighty pound the " quid			1
" and if you give someone some quid , you 're going to expect some quo			1
the phrase often lives in the courtroom , where guilt and innocence are the currency			0
it 's the oil that lubricates our legal system			0
something of a quantified value is traded for something of equal value ; elements are parted and parceled off until quid pro quo is achieved			1
most recently , @entity189 senator @entity188 co-opted the phrase to describe campaign finance and influence pedaling because he believes that one does n't give major milk to a campaign without expecting major cheese in return			0

who said the debate team does n't have sex appeal ? @entity227 - yor - em day - ee @entity226 - um ) : " all for the @entity228 " @entity229 is often shortened to @entity229			0
