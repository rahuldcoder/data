-- " the people and the army are one hand , " the chant of @entity2 's january 25th revolution on the eve of president @entity5 's resignation , has yielded in the face of toxic gases , rubber bullets and live ammunition from the security forces , composed of army and police , to " the army and the police are one dirty hand			1
" the trust and gratitude the @entity2 people once felt toward the military for their solidarity in ousting @entity5 has evaporated as the brutality of the army and police has caused scores of deaths and thousands of injuries			1
not only tear gas and rubber bullets , but also toxic gases -- which cause seizures and reportedly led to several deaths by asphyxiation -- and live ammunition have been aimed at the protesters			2
tweets from all over @entity2 reveal the shock at this criminal behavior			1
one said , " i am out of words			0
@entity2 army is murdering @entity2 civilians			1
that 's our worst living nightmare			0
" the november revolution differs from the 18 days that led to @entity5 's downfall not only in the escalating violence , but also in the new coalitions that have emerged as well as the old alliances that have been exposed			2
the @entity53 , the @entity54 opposition group , has fractured : members of its youth have aligned themselves with the protesters , while the leadership has supported the position of the @entity61 ( @entity61 ) that the parliamentary elections , which began today , must go forward			1
banking on a good showing in the elections , the @entity53 leadership stayed away from @entity67 for the first week of this month 's protests			2
@entity70 youths discovered their leadership 's duplicity on the first day of the demonstrations , november 18 , which was called as a day of protest by @entity70			0
the plan to have a contained demonstration backfired and led to the current nationwide uprising			2
@entity78 , a female journalist , activist and member of the @entity53 , said in an interview posted on @entity82 that they were urged to leave @entity67 on the first night of the protests , when a few hundred youth activists moved in to reclaim the square			2
" the @entity53 and @entity88 leaders insisted we go home after the friday protests ...			0
i decided to stay with my brothers and sisters here in the sit - in in @entity67 friday night until our voices are heard			0
then the brutal , deadly attacks on us started			0
i can not help but think now that those @entity70 ' leaders had some sort of a deal with @entity61 , but thank @entity101 it did not work out			1
" after days of equivocating on the violence , the @entity103 first called on the military to halt its attacks on the protesters , and then , in a dramatic change of position , withdrew its support for the @entity61			1
the @entity112 statement , issued early friday morning , called for " full transfer of power to a civilian government " in a " just and inclusive manner			0
" it was greeted with incredulity in @entity67			0
as in the january revolution , the @entity103 government has been perceived as supporting its allies -- the @entity61 as much as @entity5 -- over the democratic aspirations of the people			1
that the tear gas canisters still bear the moniker " @entity125 , " as they did in january , does not help			0
in its support for proceeding with the parliamentary elections , the @entity103 finds itself in an odd allegiance with the @entity61 and the @entity53 and out of touch with the sentiment on the street			1
@entity67 never has been about " free and fair elections first , " although the people have that expectation			2
the revolution of people carrying signs asking for " dignity , " " freedom , " " equality " and " social justice " always encompassed much more than political processes			0
the people dying on @entity2 's streets are fighting for the true conditions of a just society			2
elections , which in @entity2 always can be manipulated , can not be trusted to deliver that goal			1
far from promoting democracy , holding the parliamentary elections on time ignores the will of the people -- not to mention the sacrifices of those who have been killed or wounded -- and plays into the hands of the @entity61			1
many factors taint the elections : -- holding the elections amounts to a forced approval of @entity61 's brutal repressive practices , with the violence still ongoing throughout @entity2 , out of the sight of the cameras in @entity67			1
-- exerting total control over the media , @entity61 manipulates public opinion with unchecked lies about protesters ( think of the three @entity103 college students who were detained ) and bullies independent networks , such as @entity171 , with defamation campaigns , often targeting individual reporters , such as @entity174			1
-- after refusing for months to allow international monitors to observe the elections , @entity61 relented at the last moment			1
but irregularities such as removing the ballot boxes to remote locations remain troubling			0
a full post-election evaluation will reveal the monitors ' assessment of the transparency and honesty of the elections			0
-- governance is in chaos			0
the country , in effect , has three governments , not to mention @entity61 : the new prime minister , @entity192 , appointed by @entity61 and still forming a @entity193 ; the interim prime minister , @entity195 , supposedly still in position ; and a @entity67 - formed @entity197 , led by the former diplomat and @entity200 winner @entity199 , former @entity53 leader @entity201 and others			1
the november protests have shaken @entity2 out of a period of post-revolution stagnation , with serious implications for the future			2
with the exception of those who have joined the protests , the military , from the generals at the top to the soldier on the street , has violated the trust of the people			0
now they are seen in the same light as @entity5			0
many @entity53 youths have broken off and have joined forces with the broad coalition of protesters			0
@entity224 , @entity2 's leading religious institution , has weighed in with the people against @entity61			1
and the " leaderless revolution " now has political backing			0
a coalition of many leaders from the principal parties , called by @entity199 , has formally asked @entity61 to leave			2
also , representatives of the principal revolutionary movements have come together to support @entity199 as prime minister over the @entity61 's choice of @entity192			2
the @entity2 people , who at times since january have seemed apathetic about the future of the revolution , have shown their determination to reclaim it			1
the protesters all determined to stay in @entity67 , and on the streets and squares of @entity2 , until @entity61 steps down , hands power to a civil body , and submits to a public independent investigation into the violence and killings in january and february , the @entity248 protests ( when the police attacked peaceful @entity250 ) and the strife in november			1
as noted by a slogan pasted to the walls at @entity254 ( now turned into a field hospital ) , " you can crush the @entity257 , but it wo n't delay the @entity258			0
" the opinions in this commentary are solely those of the authors .			0

@entity263 , @entity264 : amid violence against protesters , @entity2 have lost faith in military
protesters demand ruling @entity61 step aside , they say
the current parliamentary elections are tainted by the military council , they say
@entity2 are determined to reclaim their country , @entity263 and @entity264 say
