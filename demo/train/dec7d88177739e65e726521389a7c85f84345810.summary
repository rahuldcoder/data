-- top - billed @entity1 is comprehensively miscast in " @entity2 , " the first of the year 's two big - budget , live - action " @entity6 " movies			1
even so , this pretty bauble of a picture -- which looks like it was filmed in a giant snow globe - scrapes together enough invention , exuberance and goofiness to skate over this blatant misstep , and @entity1 herself is so willing to give it the old college try you wind up rooting for her regardless			2
she plays the evil queen , @entity6 's murderous stepmother -- a role that calls for cold - blooded malice , arrogance , cunning and class , qualities conspicuously lacking in this warm , earthy , intuitive actress , and who settles for a snooty ( but inconsistent ) @entity30 accent as the next best thing			1
still , good for @entity1 for having some fun at the expense of midlife vanity			0
as we all know , the queen is hung up on what her mirror tells her about getting old -- she ca n't bear being eclipsed in the beauty stakes by her stepdaughter @entity6 ( @entity41 , @entity43 's daughter )			1
in one of the movie 's funniest jibes , she submits to an excruciating beauty treatment involving bird poop , snails and scorpion stings ( a fairytale botox ) to give her that extra edge -- a regimen that 's probably only a slight exaggeration on what @entity56 royalty routinely puts up with to keep in front of the cameras past a certain age			0
@entity1 , 44 , has never been that kind of glamour - puss			2
it 's her personality that makes her so attractive , so she can afford to smile			0
and she cuts quite a figure in the outrageously decadent dresses , designed for her by @entity68			0
the @entity70 stylist , who died in january , is best known in the @entity71 for her costumes for @entity74 's " @entity73 " as well as pop stars @entity75 and @entity77 , and the opening ceremony at the @entity79			0
@entity68 's aggressively sumptuous , sometimes surrealistic , creations have also been a staple in all three of @entity84 's previous films : " @entity85 , " " @entity86 " and , recently , " immortals			0
" her contribution to " @entity2 " is so pronounced , it 's only fitting the film is dedicated to her			2
@entity1 ' gowns include a vermilion peacock creation so ornate it requires its own tax levy on the hard - pressed peasantry -- but @entity68 's genius is equally well displayed in the perfectly chosen headwear that goes a long way to distinguishing the personalities of the film 's seven dwarfs			1
these pugnacious rogues ( @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and @entity105 are some of their names ) are a very different crew from @entity109 's loveable gold - diggers , but they 're @entity84 's best defense against a wobbly , hit - and - miss script			0
@entity113 bandits , they dress up as bandy - legged giants ( @entity68 provides them with stilts that seem to be made of accordion sleeves ) to set upon unwary travelers , like @entity119 's @entity118			1
in due course , they take in the exiled @entity6 -- in return for housecleaning and cooking services -- and teach her how to stand on her own two feet			0
@entity125 is charming as the innocent princess , the poison apple in her stepmother 's eye , but the film 's real surprise is the tongue - in - cheek tone , a lightness that stands in sharp relief to the turgid breast - beating this filmmaker went in for in " immortals			1
" it 's been a while since @entity140 got this much screen time to camp it up , as the @entity35 's butler , @entity143 ( even if he does spend some of it in the form of cockroach ) , and @entity119 's a hoot as the arrogant -- but oh - so - eligible -- prince			1
" @entity2 " may not add up to the sum of its better parts -- and it 's a curious time of year to release it -- but there should be an audience for a frivolous family film with this many frills and ruffles .			2

in " @entity2 , " @entity1 plays the evil queen , @entity6 's murderous stepmother
@entity41 is charming as the innocent princess
@entity119 's a hoot as the arrogant -- but oh - so - eligible -- prince
