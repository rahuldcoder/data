editor 's note : a nationally syndicated columnist , @entity2 is the author of " listening to the @entity4 " and " speak , @entity5 ! a @entity7 's view of @entity8			1

@entity2 says @entity11 is from a generation raised in a diverse world and open to possibility			1
@entity15 ( @entity16 ) -- there are so many things that we could take away and remember forever regarding the inauguration of the first @entity22 - @entity8 president in the history of the @entity8 , but i 'll always remember the laughter of a little girl			2
shortly after president - elect @entity28 finished the oath and became president @entity28 , he joined hands with his family and waved to the cheering voices of 1.8 million people packed from the @entity34 to the @entity35			0
people cried , others hugged , celebrities and everyday folks snapped photos to capture the moment			0
there really was an amazing energy that permeated the crowd as we all witnessed a barrier come tumbling down before our eyes			0
but what stood out for me was a moment when president @entity11 looked down at his 7 - year - old daughter , @entity51 , and she said something to him , and then let out this huge laugh			1
i do n't know whether it was her statement or his response , but the bubbly child was having the time of her life			0
the sheer joy that was on her face as she grinned from ear to ear caused me to just start laughing as i watched her reaction			0
i was shooting photos from the @entity16 platform just across from where he spoke , and one of the many images was of a beaming @entity51 alongside her mom and 10 - year - old sister , @entity73 can you imagine what was going through this young girl 's mind , to see her father stand there and take the oath of office ? as i saw her that day , and later bouncing along a sidewalk as she walked with her father , my niece @entity86 came to mind			1
their smiles and bouncy walk are so much alike , and both are the same age			0
these young girls , and countless other black children , among others , will grow up in an @entity8 where what they can imagine is backed up by what they see			2
despite the reality that racism has n't left us , these children have the advantage of not being burdened with being separated by race			0
so much has been written about today 's generation living in a world where hip - hop music brought them all together in one room , coupled with the diverse images on television and movies			1
their reality is not the reality of their parents , and we will see that play out a lot in the future			0
what also is most compelling about this age of @entity11 is how he has been received thus far internationally			2
many political experts are simply stunned that a man who has only been on the national stage for five years would have so much good will across the pond			0
of course , a lot of that has to do with the fact that president @entity131 and his team were seen as running roughshod over their international partners , praising them when they needed something , and savaging them when they disagreed with the @entity8 position			2
yet what we also ca n't ignore is that @entity11 's skin tone also plays a central role			1
@entity8 may be shocked to find out that people of color make up two - thirds of the world population			1
they know all too well about @entity8 's pathetic and violent history of enslaving and later oppressing african - americans , and it was always seen as ridiculous for @entity8 officials to condemn human rights abuses abroad while racial and other forms of discrimination existed in their own backyard			1
@entity11 's election sends a powerful signal to the world that @entity8 are backing up their rhetoric and ideals with action , and @entity11 serves as that powerful symbol			1
@entity28 now has the opportunity to show those who voted for him -- and those who did n't -- that the change he often spoke about can come to pass			0
if he is able to fulfill many of the promises he made during the campaign , he will go down as one of @entity8 's most successful presidents , looked at fondly by the @entity8 people			1
and if he does , maybe we 'll end up having the same smile he received courtesy of @entity51			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			2

@entity2 : @entity11 laughed joyously after her father took the oath
he says her generation wo n't have the same racial burden as its parents
@entity2 : @entity51 is growing up in a world of diversity , with great possibilities
@entity2 : in a diverse world , @entity11 's skin tone strengthens @entity8
