@entity1 president @entity0 conceded his party 's defeat tuesday , setting the stage for the nation 's first peaceful , democratic transition through election since the breakup of the @entity9			1
victory in the parliamentary elections went to a coalition headed by billionaire businessman @entity13			2
@entity13 is set to become the next prime minister			1
@entity0 will remain president until presidential elections next year			1
the result of monday 's election means @entity1 will have a multi-party parliament , boosting democracy in the nation , observers said			1
the vote also is a reflection of how the people feel about @entity0			2
he took power in 2004 after the @entity28 , the name given to widespread protests over disputed parliamentary elections			0
@entity0 is credited with having changed the country by moving toward integration with the @entity33 , with steps such as seeking membership in the @entity36 and @entity37			2
he also revamped the nation 's economy , retooling it to reflect a free market system			0
but critics said that beneath the surface , his government was dominated by @entity9 - style " administrative measures			0
" @entity13 , whose @entity45 won a majority of seats in the 150 - member parliament , said the new government would seek to mend the country 's troubled relations with @entity53			1
the two nations fought a brief but bitter war four years ago over the breakaway region of @entity57			0
" restoring relations with the @entity61 is one of our main tasks and we will strive in every way to do this , " he told @entity59			1
" i think it 's achievable but not easy			0
first we have to convince the @entity61 that our strategy toward @entity37 and @entity69 is not harmful to and does not contradict @entity53 interests			1
" @entity37 ambitions his coalition shares the outgoing government 's ambitions to join the @entity37 alliance , he said			0
@entity53 and @entity1 would also need to work together in the future to resolve the issue of separatist territories , @entity13 said			1
" the @entity80 is a very complex and explosive region			0
i think , here , we will find common interests in the future , " he said			0
in a statement released by his office , @entity0 said he would assist the transition to a new government and that his party , the @entity88 , would now assume the role of the main opposition			1
" it is well known to you that for us , and for me personally , the ideas of the coalition are fundamentally unacceptable			0
there are very deep differences between us , and we think that they are extremely wrong , " he said			0
" however , democracy works so that the @entity1 people make decisions by majority and this is what we hugely respect			2
" @entity0 paid tribute to the country 's achievements over the past eight years , citing progress in fighting crime and corruption as well as in building new institutions , and said his party would fight in opposition to protect those advances			1
@entity53 prime minister @entity112 said the results indicate the people of @entity1 want change			1
" if these results become a reality , then the @entity1 political landscape will be more diverse , " he said			1
" it should be welcome because it probably means that more responsible and constructive forces are entering the parliament			0
" @entity123 , 31 , shot video of jubilant opposition voters waving flags and honking car horns near @entity128 in the @entity1 capital , @entity130			2
he said he had voted for @entity0 because he thought the president stabilized the country			2
" many things have changed since he came to power , " @entity123 said			0
" we are more stable and peaceful than before			0
" the @entity136 hailed the election as a " significant step in the consolidation of @entity1 democracy			1
" " @entity1 citizens have set a regional and global example by conducting a competitive campaign , freely exercising their democratic rights , and affirming their commitment to undertake a peaceful transfer of power , " the @entity141 said in a statement , adding that much work remains in coming days and months			1
the vote in the parliamentary election had not been fully tallied , with @entity1 's @entity152 continuing to count			1
the commission 's performance has been lauded as professional and independent , said @entity156 , president of the @entity156 , a democracy support organization funded by the @entity158			2
" there 's no question in my mind ... the election commission can be relied upon , " he said from @entity130			0
ireporter @entity163 , an @entity136 teacher living in the @entity165 region in central @entity1 , said the scene was calm monday night and tuesday morning , despite the large amount of support for @entity0 in the region			1
" it turns out the election was considered free and fair , at least in our little village , " he said			0
" people were gathered outside the local convenience store discussing the outcome			0
" power shift to prime minister the new system will shift power from the president to the new prime minister , according to @entity183 , an expert on @entity1 and a senior associate at the @entity185 in @entity186			2
" the prime minister will be chosen by parliament , which thus hands important powers to whichever political force obtains a majority in parliament in the ... elections , " @entity187 said			0
until recently , @entity0 and the @entity88 have controlled much of the political life in this country of 4.5 million people			2
@entity0 has been praised by @entity136 and @entity69 officials for making progress in the fight against corruption and for continuing economic reform			1
but critics , who coalesced behind @entity13 , said reform was only skin deep , and charged that @entity0 has been pulling all the levers of @entity9 - style " administrative measures			1
" during the election campaign , they raised concerns about a level playing field for the opposition , alleging harassment and limitations over access to the media			0
money was also a major issue during the campaign , experts said			0
observers : @entity1 opposition may be premature in declaring victory for example , the government tried to regulate how much could be spent on corporate contributions and that affected how much @entity13 could spend			1
" i think that the government , at times , overstepped when it created an entity called the @entity233 to watch over these new regulations , " said @entity227 , the director of @entity228 at the @entity156 and an expert on @entity1			2
" this means , overall , that there is a closer approach to democracy which will be felt about one year from now , in october 2013 , when a presidential election happens , " @entity227 added , speaking from @entity130			0
high stakes in polarized election for his part , @entity0 has referred to the opposition leader @entity13 as that " big money guy			1
" the president accused @entity13 of wanting to " buy the whole system , " and said he saw behind him the hand of @entity53			1
the president said he was concerned by the amount of wealth that @entity13 has accrued in @entity53 , and whether that money was used to influence the elections			1
" we know what @entity53 money is all about , " he said			2
" how it was made , what kind of methods were used , and certainly it is a source of concern , " he said			0
false stereotypes , @entity13 says a self - made businessman who made his money in @entity53 after the fall of the @entity9 , @entity13 left @entity53 shortly after @entity262 came to power			1
his staff confirms his status as @entity1 's richest man , with a fortune estimated at approximately $ 6.4 billion , equal to almost half of @entity1 's economic output			1
but he said " it 's not money and wealth which is my capital			0
it 's trust from the people toward me			0
money has nothing to do with this			0
" the billionaire said he had sold all his @entity53 assets , and defended his reputation			2
but @entity0 insisted that not only @entity13 but @entity262 himself was trying to undermine @entity1			1
" @entity262 said clearly that he is interested in the @entity1 election outcome			2
he clearly said that he wanted the @entity1 government out			2
he clearly said that he wanted me to be physically destroyed , he said it publicly , " @entity0 said			0
@entity1 's electoral waters were roiled by a shocking video that emerged last month showing abuse in a @entity1 prison , including one male prisoner being sexually assaulted			1
the opposition claimed the video was proof of a repressive system put in place by @entity0 and his government			2
former @entity1 prison guard : i witnessed abuse for years @entity0 said his government had responded quickly and decisively to the video , citing an investigation that has led to arrests			1
" not only were the immediate perpetrators arrested , " he said , " but two government ministers resigned because they shared political responsibility for allowing the system to fail			0
" read more : @entity1 interior minister quits over prisoner abuse videos the torture shown on the video is no accident , but part of a system that is shameful , @entity13 said			1
@entity313 said the video is significant , as the prison population has quadrupled over the past eight or nine years			0
" i do think it ( the video ) supports the opposition narrative that the government is arrogant and unaccountable			0
and this is obviously a war of two narratives over @entity1 that we 're seeing in this election , " he said .			0

" restoring relations with the @entity61 is one of our main tasks , " @entity13 says
@entity53 's @entity112 says @entity1 's parliament is set to be more diverse
@entity0 says he respects the democratic process , will become leader of opposition
