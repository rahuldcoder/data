the @entity0 continued its recent hands - off approach on gun control , refusing on monday to accept a challenge to @entity6 's restrictions on carrying weapons in public			1
the justices without comment let stand a state law that anyone who wants to possess a handgun outside the home for self defense first prove a " justifiable need " for doing so			1
four gun owners in the state , backed by 19 states and several advocacy groups , argued the measure violated their @entity23 rights			1
the law mandates that local police and a judge first approve such gun permits			1
the court has in the past year rejected similar challenges in @entity30 , @entity31 , and @entity32			0
but all states allow at least some limited ability to carry a concealed weapon in public , often requiring " good cause " by an individual before a permit is issued			1
@entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 , and @entity43 do not require any permit for a concealed weapon			0
there are as many as 275 million guns in the @entity49 , the @entity46 estimates			1
handguns were used in three quarters of the more than 10,000 homicides involving firearms in 2005			0
the current debate follows the @entity0 's landmark 2008 ruling that affirmed an individual 's right to own a gun for the first time			1
but that divided ruling , which struck down restrictions in @entity62 , confined the analysis to the home			0
the justices left in place other gun laws , including those " forbidding the carrying of firearms in sensitive places such as schools			2
" efforts by various groups to expand the right to the streets have mostly failed			0
but a federal appeals court earlier this year ruled @entity78 's limits on those seeking a concealed carry permit was unconstitutional			0
that could lead to a high court examination of the issue in coming months			0
efforts to craft compromise gun - control legislation have stalled in @entity86 despite the @entity89 , @entity88 , school massacre in 2012 and a string of mass shootings since			0
the emphasis has shifted to the states where gun - rights advocates have made legislative gains			2
the @entity6 case is @entity97 v. @entity98 ( 13 - 827 ) .			2

the @entity0 let stand law requiring proof that a gun needs to be carried in public
four gun owners appealed , saying the @entity6 law violated their rights
there are as many as 275 million guns in the @entity49 , according to the @entity46
