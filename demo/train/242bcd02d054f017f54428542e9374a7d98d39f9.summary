-- the @entity3 virus has now become the dominant influenza virus around the globe , with high levels and an increase of activity in many regions , the @entity1 said thursday			1
in a weekly update , the @entity1 's point person on the @entity3 virus , dr. @entity10 , also warned the public not to treat the virus like just another flu			1
like seasonal flu , @entity3 is more active in the winter than in the summer , and a majority of infected people get better on their own , @entity10 said			1
@entity3 also is as transmissible and infectious as seasonal flu , he said			1
but unusually for influenza , @entity10 said , @entity3 continues at high levels over the summer months , and many of the serious illnesses and deaths are concentrated in people younger than 65			1
seven months into the pandemic , the virus commonly known as swine flu remains at high levels and continues to increase in @entity30 , @entity10 said			1
@entity32 , for example , has seen more cases from september to november than they saw in the preceding months from april , when the virus emerged , he said			1
the virus is also becoming more active in @entity36 and @entity37 and @entity38 , @entity10 said			2
health officials this week reported an outbreak of cases in @entity42 , which now has more than 250,000 cases of influenza - like illness , with 235 patients requiring intensive care , the @entity1 said			0
activity is picking up in @entity48 , @entity10 said			0
@entity49 reported " a number " of cases over the past week , he said			0
" @entity48 is one of the parts of the world where seasonal influenza viruses have remained in reasonably high circulation , " @entity10 said			1
" but even in that part of the world , the pandemic virus is becoming dominant			2
" more cases are being reported from a number of @entity63 countries such as @entity64 and @entity65 , he said			0
in @entity37 and the @entity67 , however , activity levels have dropped as those regions enter the summer season , @entity10 said			1
" there are several regions in the world -- @entity30 , @entity36 , @entity73 and @entity74 -- where we are clearly seeing pandemic influenza activity increase , " he said , but " there is no one single place in the world where we are focused on			0
" disease activity has been difficult to predict , @entity10 said			0
" we really are not going to know what the future is going to bring , and so the main focus of our effort here is ... what steps are needed to make sure countries are as prepared as possible to deal with disease levels , " he said			2
@entity3 poses different challenges in different countries , but it does seem to be affecting indigenous groups more heavily than nonindigenous groups , he said			1
in @entity99 , for example , " aboriginal groups are disproportionately represented in people who end up in hospitals from diseases related to the pandemic , " @entity10 said			2
the @entity1 still does n't know whether the effect on indigenous groups is because of the pandemic itself or because of underlying factors			1
because most people infected with swine flu tend to recover on their own and do n't suffer major problems afterwards , some people are tempted to dismiss the infection and think it 's not serious			2
but @entity10 said that 's a dangerous mind - set			0
" at @entity1 , we remain quite concerned about the patterns we are seeing , particularly because a sizable number of people develop complications [ that lead to death ] , " he said			0
" we do see that the serious complications are concentrated in the younger age groups rather than the older age groups			2
" while the complications are most often seen in people who have chronic , underlying health conditions and in pregnant women , they also can develop in people " who are currently healthy and young			0
" but contrary to some reports , @entity10 said , the @entity1 has not seen big mutations in the virus since it first emerged			1
he said viruses being isolated now are " generally similar " to those isolated over the past several months , indicating they have n't changed much			2
the @entity1 also has no evidence of widespread resistance to antiviral medication , @entity10 said			0
there have been sporadic instances of resistance to oseltamivir -- the generic name for @entity144 , one of the main drugs used against influenza -- but such cases are still " isolated and infrequent , " he said			0
" antivirals are quite useful against these infections , " he said			0
@entity10 praised as " innovative " the decision by @entity152 to distribute antiviral medication over the counter for a limited period of time			0
the move can help take stress off the primary health system and allow patients to get the medicine more quickly , he said			0
other useful protections against @entity3 are vaccines , which the @entity1 recommends against pandemic infections , @entity10 said			1
" these vaccines now have been used in a significant number of countries ... and based on this experience , in which millions of people have now received vaccine , we in fact see that these vaccines are very safe , " he said			2
the only side effects are swelling and pain at the injection site , but " these are occurring at rates that are expected and usually seen with seasonal influenza vaccine , " @entity10 said			1
" who , along with other public health authorities , believes that these vaccines are very useful against pandemic infections and [ we ] do support their use , " he said .			0

@entity3 continues at high levels over the summer months , unlike seasonal flu
the flu seems to affect indigenous groups more heavily than nonindigenous groups
the only side effects of the vaccine are swelling and pain at the injection site
