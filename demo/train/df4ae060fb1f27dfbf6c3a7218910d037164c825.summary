-- over the years , the @entity1 has thrown up a variety of competitors that defy logic			1
there was @entity8 's legendary bobsled team , a cross-country skier from @entity10 and @entity11 's @entity12 , whose inept performances in 1988 prompted a change in the qualifying rules			1
now , one of the world 's most famous violinists can be added to the eclectic mix. this weekend , @entity20 -- who has sold over 10 million albums worldwide -- sneaked through qualifying for next month 's @entity1			1
" she 's done it by a whisker , but she 's done it , " manager @entity23 told the @entity24			1
in @entity28 , @entity27 will compete as @entity20 , using the surname of her @entity31 father and representing his homeland as well			1
she may be used to racing through scales , her fingers dancing atop the strings of a violin , but the 35 - year - old must now negotiate a very different rhythm as she is pitched into the giant slalom			2
with the @entity41 starting on february 7 , @entity27 left it late to book her place -- only claiming the relevant qualifying marks this weekend , which the @entity45 ( @entity45 ) confirmed on monday			0
@entity48 qualification rules determine that countries without a skier ranked in the world 's top 500 can send one male and one female competitor to the @entity41 -- to compete in slalom and giant slalom -- as long as the athletes can achieve a second set of criteria			1
this was to produce an average of 140 points or fewer over five recognized races			0
she managed this over the weekend after competing in four giant slalom races in @entity67 , even competing in a national junior championship race where the diminutive @entity27 , 5ft 3in , stuck out by virtue of being 14 years older than her nearest rival			0
" according to the qualification system which we have , which requires her to start at least five slalom or giant slalom races , she has done so , " said @entity72 , the @entity45 's @entity74 media co-ordinator			2
" it also requires her to come below a certain number of @entity45 points , which in this case is 140			0
" @entity84 @entity27 started skiing at the age of four , a year before she took up the violin , and she describes the sport as her ' lifelong hobby '			2
such an attitude fueled her decision to relocate from @entity91 to @entity92 , after buying a house in the @entity95 resort in 2009 , where she lives with long - term boyfriend @entity98 , for whom skiing is also in the blood after growing up in the @entity102 town of @entity103 ¨ re. the musician will become only the second @entity105 to represent @entity31			1
in 2002 , @entity106 was so slow on his debut that he was pulled out of his race , before improving -- as it were -- to finish last in his cross country event at the @entity111 four years later			0
at the age of 10 , @entity27 made her solo debut with the @entity115 in @entity91			2
three years later , she was the youngest soloist ever to record the demanding @entity117 and @entity118 violin concertos			0
born in @entity119 , she grew up in @entity91 where she became famous for what she herself has termed " techno - acoustic fusion " , a mix of classical and modern styles			0
@entity27 has said that she will return to her music once her @entity48 dream is over .			0
