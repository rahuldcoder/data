video analytics company @entity0 - the one we work with to put out our monthly top 10 webisodes chart - curates a list of video called the " @entity5			1
" it includes all the web videos that have exceeded 100 million views			2
@entity9 has long been a staple of the chart , but now she 's essentially in a club all her own : she 's the first franchise to reach one billion views			1
@entity9 's music videos hold three spots in the 65 - video 100 million club - one for " @entity19 " ( 374,606,128 ) , one for " @entity20 " ( 272,941,674 ) and one for " @entity21 " ( 360,020,327 )			1
add them up and you get just over one billion views			1
she wo n't occupy the club alone for long , though ; the twilight saga is close behind with 980 million and @entity27 is at 860 million			0
@entity9 is primarily a hit on @entity29 and @entity30 ; 25 % of @entity29 's visitors only have eyes for her			2
the pop star has attracted @entity35 attention elsewhere , too			0
a @entity37 group of more than 100,000 people initiated @entity39 about a month ago , and her latest internet hit is her " telephone " music video with @entity42			0
the point is , you ca n't escape @entity9 on the @entity35			2
she 's everywhere right now			0
we welcome speculation as to exactly why the web loves her so , so let us know in the comments if you have any ideas			0
