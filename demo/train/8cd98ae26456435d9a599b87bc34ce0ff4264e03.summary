-- one of the @entity2 's basic tenets is that small contributions from lots of people can amount to something powerful in the aggregate			1
fans of the @entity10 band sour contributed images to a music video			0
now , a growing group of writers , musicians , visual artists and videographers is turning this @entity19 - era philosophy into online collaborative art. @entity22 users are banding together to write an opera for @entity25 's @entity24			1
bands like @entity27 and @entity28 , out of @entity10 , are turning to fans to help film their music videos			0
programmers are pulling quotes from online social networks to make automated poems			1
more than 50,000 animators are divvying up work on an upcoming animated film called " live music , " and amateur videographers are re-filming " @entity41 " in 15 - second bites			1
this crowd - sourced creativity online is putting a new twist on traditional ideas of artistic ownership , online communication and art production			1
" what 's exciting is that it 's being tested out by a lot of people who have access to [ the technology ] , " said @entity48 , executive director of exhibitions at the @entity50			1
" i think that we 're in a great communal workshop			0
" in recent months , the collaborative projects have been showing the professionalism it takes to get noticed amid the clutter of content on the @entity64 , said @entity65 , an online personality who orchestrated several early online art projects			1
sign up for a @entity0 art project @entity65 said people have been making collaborative online art " since the beginning of the @entity2			1
" but much of it was n't worth looking at			0
some collaborative books proved to be too much work for even herds of people to tackle			1
efforts to create massive drawings with thousands of contributors sometimes ended up looking like random scribbles , for example			0
but for some reason -- either because people are getting savvier with cameras or because the projects are getting more visibility -- things are starting to click , @entity65 said			1
even if some of the latest collaborative efforts fail to produce masterworks , the real value is the process , he said			2
" even if the [ @entity22 - written ] opera ends up sucking as a performance , the value may have already been played out in the theater of the creation of it , " he said			2
many of the projects aim to hit on universal themes			2
" the little elements that are n't synchronized " in the group art projects remind people that our differences are what make us interesting , said @entity108 , associate dean of the school of film and digital media at the @entity112 , referring to this music video , which features fans of the @entity10 band @entity28			1
" the backgrounds change , the people move differently , the quality and temperature of the photography varies from component to component , " he said			2
" if that phenomenon did n't exist , if we were all the same and we were all uniform , this type of collaboration " would not be powerful			0
@entity127 , of the @entity128 , said the projects speak to how people yearn to communicate and to be heard in these hyperconnected , digital times			1
" it lets you ... meet other people , " she said			2
" we 're not talking @entity136 , but all these things , they 're interesting and they are of the moment			0
when people want to use [ communication technologies ] in a creative way , that 's really exciting			2
" the online art collaborations grow out of a parlor - game tradition called " exquisite corpse , " she said			1
around 1920 , famous surrealist artists gathered to draw portraits in pieces			0
they folded up large sheets of paper so that each artist could see only the edges of what had already been drawn			2
the pictures made sense only after the paper was unfolded			0
the online versions of this concept take the idea further because they involve people all over the world who often know nothing of each other , she said			1
for example , @entity167 's site , inbflat.net , features 20 @entity170 videos of musicians , many of whom do n't know each other , playing various melodies in the key of b flat			1
visitors to the site can play the tunes in any order or combination they choose , meaning that each user in a sense becomes part of the artwork , @entity167 said			2
@entity167 , who once played bass with @entity188 and now writes music for tv ads , said the " in @entity192 " project shows that " the world can come together and we all speak that [ musical ] language			0
" " something about it is very hopeful , " he said			0
one key to the project 's success , he said , is that it takes relatively little effort for musicians to send in web - quality videos of themselves playing a short melody in a certain key			1
" they 're happy to start picking up a video camera and start shooting or they 're happy to pick up an instrument and start playing , " he said			2
@entity167 finds that idea so compelling that he 's participated in other projects			2
with his two sons , ages 7 and 11 , he shot three of the 15 - second clips of the user - generated " @entity41 " that will be stitched together by the site @entity219			1
in one of the videos , he and the boys act out a scene with puppets			0
in another , his sons wear hooded sweatshirts and fight with light sabers in a @entity230 tunnel			0
in some cases , people do n't even know they 're making contributions to online art. @entity235 , a web developer in @entity236 , created the " @entity239 " by aggregating public @entity22 posts and arranging them in rhyming couplets			1
computers add 10 to 20 lines to the poem each minute , he said			0
@entity235 said he does n't consider his work art. " it was just a random idea that popped up and i played with it			0
and it is what it is , " he said			0
art professors said deciding what is and is n't art is a complicated process			0
in some ways , these collaborative projects are fine art , they said			1
in other ways they 're like games or means of communication			0
like all good art , these projects are trying to " stand convention on its ear , " said @entity108 , from the @entity112			1
" that 's going to keep happening , " he said			0
" so as soon as we finally nail this down you 'll have another group of talented artists that are going to say , ' well , i 'm going to do something completely different			0

large groups of people are creating collaborative art projects online
one site wants to re-film " @entity41 " in 15 - second clips , submitted by *viewers*
another has a *customizable* *tapestry* of 20 musicians , each playing their own tune
*experts* say the art comments on digital society and online connections
