@entity6 's @entity5 tours vineyards outside @entity13 , @entity8			1
@entity13 , @entity8 ( @entity6 ) -- i 'm not a wine drinker			1
before today 's excursion , in fact , i could only tell you that on the face of the planet there existed three types of wine : red , white and @entity25			1
the reds are good with meat			1
the whites go with fish			1
and , according to what i learned from my dad , @entity25 goes with a glass of ice			2
so , exploring @entity8 's wine country , just a short drive from @entity13 , seemed like a perfect educational way for me to spend my day			1
i mean , it was that or go to a museum			2
our guide , @entity42 , was amazingly knowledgeable about the subject , but without being a pretentious jerk			2
really , as far as he is concerned , the best wine in the world is whatever wine you enjoy			2
i did n't ask , but was curious if that applied to @entity51 ? throughout the day , we hit four wineries , tasting 23 bottles in all			2
i know because i kept hash marks on my hand			0
now , despite the outstanding info we received from our guide as we sipped and swirled and spat , i ca n't say that i 'm any better at understanding the finer points of wine than i was this morning when i woke up			0
however , i did manage to get a solid buzz			0
and that should be worth something			0
even without the wine , a visit to @entity8 's vineyards is a great addition to a traveler 's to - do list			1
it 's not far from the city and the scenery is beautiful			1
if you need an added incentive , there are even a few cheese farms in the area where you can really crank the whole experience up to 11			0
i personally thanked one of the goats for his contribution			0
he did n't seem to care			0
he also did n't seem physically capable of producing anything that might actually turn into cheese			0
but i thanked him anyway			0
what can i say ? i 'm not a wine drinker .			0
