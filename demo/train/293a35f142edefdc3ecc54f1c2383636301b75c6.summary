@entity0 , @entity1 -- wearing a plaid green a-line spring skirt from her new fashion line , paired with a black patent leather belt and black leather gladiator sandal stilettos , " @entity4 " actress @entity3 is the perfect combination of sweet and fierce when we meet up after her fashion show at the @entity13 department store in @entity0 , @entity1			1
@entity3 surrounded by models and @entity13 store official @entity15			1
it 's a look that totally says her character , @entity18 , with a little bit of screen pal @entity20			0
@entity21 is so much like her character , adorable and upbeat , i expect @entity20 or @entity24 to drop in on our conversation and say something to shock her			1
as any true fan knows ... ok ... as every woman knows , watching " @entity4 " was like being front row at a fashion show with a plot			1
tv show and movie costume designer @entity33 dressed the characters in haute couture as they skipped down the streets of @entity39 in $ 600 stilettos			1
but is this reality ? most sane women would n't choose to walk even one city block in high heels			2
and most women certainly ca n't spend a month 's rent on a belt or bag , even if they have a truly fabulous party to wear it to			2
so , what about us , the fashionistas on a budget ? are we to be ignored , forced to wear boring clothing and practical shoes ? luckily , no ; designers are catching on			2
@entity57 features affordable lines from high - end designers like @entity60 and @entity61			0
all of the pieces in @entity64 's clothing line bitten cost less than $ 20 before the clothing store that carried them went under			2
@entity21 is the latest celebrity to jump on the clothing label bandwagon , designing a line for @entity13 department stores			1
will she meet the same fate as @entity72 ? @entity21 has the following to be successful			1
although her character was by far the most conservatively dressed ( @entity20 strolling through town in just a bra top , anyone ? ) , she had the most wearable wardrobe , and @entity21 became a fashion icon along with the rest of the ladies			1
her favorite piece from her line ? " i ca n't decide , impossible to choose ! " she says			2
so i choose for her : definitely the gladiator heels			0
" it 's important for women to have a strong shoe , " she says			1
" then you can wear anything on top			0
with a strong shoe on , you 're good to go			2
" she admits she did n't have a defined style before meeting field , who bluntly told her that " sexy secretary " was going to be her look			0
@entity21 ' philosophy is a good one : stick with what works			1
she takes the look that @entity103 defined for her " @entity4 " character			2
original it 's not , but everything coming down the runway is something the stylish @entity109 would definitely wear			0
@entity21 is in touch with all of us real women out there , saying , " i do n't want to make clothing that only skinny actresses could wear			1
" her solution ? dresses , shoes and swimsuits worthy of a " @entity4 " episode that you do n't need @entity124 pockets to afford			1
it 's versatile enough to look good on every body type			0
" everyone has body issues			0
i really wanted to create pieces that looked good on different kinds of bodies			0
i had all of my family members trying on the outfits ! " she says with a laugh			0
@entity21 wo n't spill any secrets from the scripts of the " @entity4 " movie sequel , which comes out in may 2010 , but she admits it 's a " happy " movie			1
she does hint that our famous foursome might have to cut back a little on their clothing expenses as art imitates life			0
and she 's willing to share some fashion tips : how to look like you stepped out of the wardrobe room on the set of the next " @entity4 " movie ? @entity151			1
" it 's the color " she says			0
and hey , who does n't need to save some green ? it all works out perfectly			0
i left the meeting with @entity21 to check out her displays			2
then i skipped out into the streets of @entity0 , in a pair of her new gladiator stiletto sandals			0
that i got on sale , of course .			0
