-- hpv - caused throat cancer made headlines this summer when the @entity3 reported that actor @entity4 contracted throat cancer not through tobacco and alcohol , but from human papillomavirus			1
@entity4 later said the statement was a misunderstanding , but doctors say @entity12 could actually contribute to malignant growths in the throat , most likely via oral sex			2
in fact , the @entity16 reports that about 60 % of oropharyngeal cancers â € ” cancers of the throat , tonsils and the base of tongue â € ” are related to @entity12			1
now , a study published in the journal @entity26 reports that poor oral health , which includes dental problems and gum disease , is an independent risk factor for oral hpv infection , and by extension , could also contribute to oral cancers			1
the research team from the @entity35 in @entity36 studied more 3,400 participants between the ages 30 to 69 who were part of the 2009 - 2010 @entity40			0
the volunteers provided data on their oral health as well as on their hpv - infection status			1
@entity0 : yes , you can get throat cancer from oral sex those who reported poor oral health had a 56 % higher rate of hpv infection than those whose mouths were healthy , and people who had gum disease and dental problems had a 51 % higher risk of being infected with hpv than those who did n't have these issues			1
the connection between the virus , which is most often associated with sexually transmitted diseases , and oral cancers only emerged about five years ago , dr. @entity59 , a professor at @entity60 who studies hpv infections in the head , throat and neck , told time in june			2
every year in the @entity71 , more than 2,370 new cases of @entity12 - related oropharyngeal cancers are diagnosed in women and about 9,356 are diagnosed in men			1
white men have the highest rates of hpv - related throat cancer , fueling a recent rise in @entity12 - related oral cancers overall while tumors associated with tobacco have been declining			1
" in the @entity71 , there is an active shift going on , " @entity59 told @entity0			0
" fortunately thanks to tobacco policy and public - health awareness , the incidence rate for the classical head and neck cancer caused by smoking is declining			2
but unfortunately , the rate of oropharynx cancer is still going up and it 's because of the hpv component			0
" some of that rise can be attributed to barriers that public health campaigns faced in addressing a sexually transmitted virus			0
when two vaccines that protect against the most common forms of @entity12 became available after 2006 , for example , political and social resistance to vaccinating young girls as part of the childhood vaccination schedule led to slow uptake of the inoculation			0
parents and politicians worried that the shot would promote promiscuity among pre-adolescents , and were also concerned about reports that the immunizations caused serious side effects such as fainting			0
there were even claims that they also contributed to mental disorders			0
both proved unfounded , as studies verified the safety of the vaccines and the lack of heightened sexual activity among vaccinated girls			0
if left untreated , @entity12 can cause cancers in the cervix , anus , penis , vulva , vagina , as well as in the head and neck			2
some forms of the virus also contribute to genital warts , but the latest studies suggest that the hpv vaccines can lower infection rates and therefore may be important weapons in fighting not just cervical cancer but oral cancers as well			1
that 's important since there is currently no scientifically proven way of testing for oral hpv , which makes monitoring for these virus - related cancers in the mouth more challenging and preventing them more critical			1
@entity0 : new cancer screening guidelines include hpv tests even without a shot , however , the researchers say their results hint that it may be relatively easy to control @entity12 in the oropharynx â € ” by brushing regularly and keeping the mouth environment clean			2
" the good news is , the risk factor is modifiable -- by maintaining good oral hygiene and good oral health , one can prevent hpv infection and subsequent hpv - related cancers , " said study author @entity154 , a postdoctoral research fellow at the @entity35 in a statement			1
and there are other benefits to brushing as well			0
good oral health may also prevent other conditions such as the gum disease gingivitis , which has been linked to heart disease			2
a healthy mouth , it seems can also be a sign of a healthy body			0
