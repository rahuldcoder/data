-- it might be hard to believe , but as difficult as cancer was , in some ways it was good for me			1
do n't get me wrong , i would n't wish it on anyone			0
even the word " cancer " brings back the nausea and pain , the fear i felt and the heartbreak i saw in my parents ' faces			1
the smells that fill hospitals and the constant tired feeling that comes with treatment are also permanently stuck in my memory			0
but here 's the thing : the disease changed the path of my life in some ways that have been really great			0
for one , going home after my diagnosis for treatment at the @entity30 in @entity31 brought me even closer to my parents			0
i always knew they 'd be there for me , but i understood their love in a whole new way once i saw how they cared for me during treatment			0
when i was called up by the @entity39 i thought i 'd always be the one who would be taking care of them , but cancer turned the tables for a bit			1
they were amazing in my recovery , and we 're closer today than perhaps we would have been had i not gotten sick			0
when i recovered , the @entity39 told me i was going to head to @entity49 , @entity50 , to get back in major league shape			1
honestly , i was n't happy			0
once you make the majors it 's never a great feeling to go back to the minors -- no matter what the circumstances			0
but i met an amazing young woman named @entity60 there , and today she is my wife and ( the best ) mom to our son , @entity63			1
who knows if i would have met her -- the love of my life -- if i had not had cancer ? when i hit the five - year cancer - free mark in 2011 , two things happened : @entity60 gave birth to our son and my dad was diagnosed with cancer			2
thankfully , @entity75 is doing fine , but these life events caused me to think about how i should be giving back			0
i could n't help thinking of how i would feel if @entity63 had to go through what i or my dad had to deal with fighting cancer			2
i had visited hospitals on @entity39 trips and met a number of kids battling cancer			1
i knew from speaking with them that my experience mattered to these kids and that the words of encouragement helped			0
together with @entity60 , we decided pediatric cancer research would be our cause and our mantra would be never quit			1
@entity93 , or " @entity94 , " is both a campaign that supports kids in the fight against cancer and funds much needed research			1
@entity93 is embossed on baseballs that can be signed , played with and given to a boy or girl battling cancer			1
they send the message to stick with it and get better because there are a whole bunch of people waiting for them to get back onto the field			0
the funds we raise support the @entity112			2
in addition to the balls , we 're encouraging people to hold @entity93 games in their community to support the children in their area and raise funds for research			1
as i travel the country for away games , i meet kids fighting cancer in almost every city			2
they visit the ballpark , and i invite them onto the field so we can chat and then watch the game			2
i hope the little things i 'm doing really make a difference to the kids in the battle today and the big fundraising events we 're holding will minimize or cure pediatric cancer for the kids tomorrow			1
i 'm proud to do my part to make a difference , and i know i have cancer to thank for my inspiration			2
