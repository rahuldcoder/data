@entity0 , @entity1 -- as discussions swirled about its origins and impact , the @entity4 forest service chief deemed a raging wildfire in southern @entity1 as " the number one priority " for firefighters nationwide			1
" the conditions that we 're dealing with here are as bad as we can get , " said @entity13 , head of the @entity14 , of the combination of high temperatures , low humidity , ample " fuel " and strong winds			2
" it just ca n't get any worse			1
" @entity24 , a spokesman for the @entity25 , said that no cause has been determined for the so - called @entity28 fire , which has spread across the @entity29 and burned 20,956 acres as of saturday afternoon			1
he said authorities likely wo n't state a cause until the blaze is more under control			2
" we know where it started and when it started , but ( the specific cause ) is under investigation , " @entity13 said hours later from southern @entity1			1
" when we do have that information , we will share it			0
" but in a press conference , @entity1 sen. @entity40 blamed illegal immigrants for starting unspecified fires in that area			1
" there is substantial evidence that some of these fires have been caused by people who have crossed our border illegally , " @entity40 said			1
" the answer to that part of the problem is to get a secure border			1
the @entity57 senator said that illegal immigrants set such fires either to send signals , keep warm or distract law enforcement agents			0
but he did not specify which fires allegedly had been started by illegal immigrants , nor identify his sources or provide details of the " substantial " evidence he cited			0
@entity66 , a civil rights advocate who ran unsuccessfully against @entity40 as a @entity69 candidate in 2010 , called @entity40 's remarks suggesting illegal immigrants caused the fires " careless and reckless " but not entirely surprising given the political climate in @entity1			1
" you have to have some sort of factual basis : @entity40 should know better , " said @entity77 , a co-founder of citizens for a @entity79 , which is working to recall state sen. @entity80 , the primary sponsor of @entity1 's controversial anti-illegal immigration law			1
" it 's easier to fan the flames of intolerance , especially in @entity1			1
" @entity77 said it is particularly distressing that immigrants are being blamed for destructive fires , at a time when many are also being targeted given the state 's unemployment , foreclosure and other economic issues			2
" people are looking for someone to blame , " he said , claiming it is too easy and convenient to target what he called one of @entity1 's " most vulnerable populations			1
" @entity101 , the president of the @entity102 , criticized @entity40 for what he called " increasingly blatant " political opportunism			1
" the degree of irresponsible political pandering by @entity40 has no limits , " @entity101 said in an email to @entity2			1
" with the lack of evidence , he might as well also blame aliens from outer space for the fires			0
" while a fire at the @entity116 's @entity115 is 100 % contained , according to @entity117 , the @entity28 fire itself was 27 % contained as of saturday afternoon -- an improvement over the 15 % figure in the morning , but certainly dangerous given the inordinately dry and windy conditions			1
" this has been the number one priority in the country for a couple of days , " @entity13 said			0
" that means this will receive resources before anyone else			0
" @entity117 noted 764 people , including 23 crews , 54 engines and various aircraft were battling the blaze			0
the temperature in that area hit 92 degrees @entity139 during the day , with humidity low at 12 % -- " which is pretty bad , " the spokesman said			2
the @entity28 fire , just south of @entity142 , @entity1 , grew dramatically friday , racing down from canyons and gobbling parched grasslands and brush , not to mention torching at least 40 homes			1
@entity147 , who operates @entity149 nursery in @entity150 , a community just east of the fire , said grasses 2 to 3 feet tall have not seen rain since december , making for a ready fire fuel source			2
@entity142 has had 0.13 inches of rain this year , according to @entity156 of the @entity158 office in @entity0 , compared with 2.5 to 3 inches in a normal year			0
there 's no rain in the forecast			2
" i 'm trying to sit it out , " @entity147 said			0
" this grass is so dry			0
" @entity1 gov. @entity164 has issued emergency declarations for the @entity28 fire and another blaze , @entity168 , making @entity169 eligible for $ 100,000 toward response and recovery expenses			1
meanwhile , residents of the eastern @entity1 community of @entity174 got some good news with the lifting of an evacuation order at 10 a.m. saturday , according to fire spokesman @entity178			2
the community has a population of about 300 , but many more seasonal visitors were forced to leave earlier this month because of the historically large wallow fire			2
the wallow fire , which burned 500,409 acres , was 38 % contained saturday			1
" there have been no surprises , " said @entity178 , of the @entity174 residents ' return			0
" @entity1 was n't the only state struggling with wildfires this weekend			1
the @entity158 had issued red - flag alerts for much of the state , all of @entity192 , and parts of @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and @entity198			0
such alerts indicate firefighting conditions may prove difficult due to low humidity and wind gusts in excess of 40 miles per hour			0
" we are having an extremely dry year all the way across the south , " @entity13 said			0
the @entity14 chief said earlier saturday at the same press conference attended by @entity40 that he was " very optimistic " that damage from future wildfires could be minimized by thinning forests and clearing out biomass -- which did occur , to some extent , in parts of eastern @entity1			1
he noted that 3.2 million acres were " treated " nationwide last year			0
he and senators @entity40 and @entity215 , @entity1 , noted saturday that parts of the wallow fire that had been " treated " appeared set to survive the blaze , which stretched over 40 miles , while those that had not had been wiped out			1
" with the forest restoration work , we can change the intensity of fire behavior , " @entity13 said			0
" that 's forest resiliency -- that 's what we want to work on			0
" @entity215 noted that the estimated $ 64.1 million price for the wallow fire would more than double after the costs of mitigation efforts to prevent mudslides from the summer monsoons			0
" just think that what we could have done using those funds to treat those forests in advance , " @entity215 said			0
but government budget strains have limited the amount of money going to such efforts			0
@entity40 said " the only way we are going to get these ( forests ) thinned is through greater participation of private enterprise " -- adding the government should try to facilitate such initiatives , including by allowing limited logging in national parks			2
" there is simply not enough tax dollars to get the job done without them , " @entity40 said of private companies			2
@entity2 's @entity255 contributed to this report .			0
