" we met with one 20 - year - old woman today who watched her husband get stabbed to death right in front of her , " she said			2
he was " then covered with kerosene and then lit on fire -- literally burned to a crisp before her very eyes			0
" that happened , she said , just last thursday			0

" i agree , " @entity10 said			1
" it really could have descended very , very quickly into a bloodbath			0
" " one of the reasons that the president asked me to take the trip here is to assess the situation up front , to try to look ahead and see what will be needed , " @entity10 said			1
it is important , @entity10 added , that " we walk and chew gum at the same time			1

" the continuing violence , the extensive destruction of property , and the forced displacement of the population in @entity20 are feeding enormous anger , hostility and mistrust , " said @entity168			2

residential neighborhoods must be made safe as an urgent priority in order to allow people to go back to their homes and resume their normal lives			2

both sides have burned down large swaths of villages in the northern @entity259 province , the rights group said , adding that relief workers have found it difficult to provide help , particularly emergency medical aid , as aid workers have also been the targets of attacks			2
