@entity0 -- -- it 's ok for @entity5 to want president @entity6 to fail if they think he 's jeopardizing the country , @entity3 gov. @entity2 told members of his political party tuesday night			1
gov. @entity2 is offering a spirited defense of republicans who say they want president @entity6 to fail			1
@entity2 described the premise of the question -- " do you want the president to fail ? " -- as the " latest gotcha game " being perpetrated by @entity17 against @entity5			1
" make no mistake : anything other than an immediate and compliant , ' why no sir , i do n't want the president to fail , ' is treated as some sort of act of treason , civil disobedience or political obstructionism , " @entity2 said at a political fundraiser attended by 1,200 people			2
" this is political correctness run amok			0
" since conservative radio talk show host @entity29 said that he hoped that @entity6 would fail , @entity5 have been pressed by @entity17 and the media about @entity29 's comments			1
@entity2 , a potential 2012 presidential candidate , told the @entity5 audience he would " not be brow beaten on this , and i will not kowtow to their correctness			1
" " my answer to the question is very simple : ' do you want the president to fail ? ' it depends on what he is trying to do			0
" @entity2 , who served two terms in the @entity44 , returned to @entity0 to help his former colleagues raise more than $ 6 million for the 2010 midterm elections			1
and he likely picked up important political chits , should he decide to run for president			0
so far , @entity2 has sidestepped questions about 2012			1
but on tuesday he seemed to be laying the groundwork in case he eventually decides the political climate is right			0
a video of favorable back - to - back tv reports about @entity2 preceded his introduction to the audience			2
and @entity2 used his remarks to deep - pocketed @entity5 donors to emphasize his vision for how the @entity5 can get back on track			1
he made a point to criticize @entity6 and @entity63 speaker @entity62 for a " spending spree " that he said " is costing the taxpayers more than the @entity67 war , more than the @entity68 , and , near and dear to my heart , even more than the @entity70			0
" @entity2 singled out @entity71 for standing up to @entity6 and helping the @entity5 return to its conservative roots			1
the governor took a controversial stand when he refused to accept $ 98 million in federal stimulus money to expand unemployment benefits in @entity3 , because he said it would force an unfair tax on businesses when the funding ran out			2
democrats and other critics blasted @entity2 's decision , saying he was influenced by presidential ambitions			1
but many conservatives saw his decision as a principled stand			0
moments after @entity2 wrapped up his remarks tuesday , @entity6 held his second prime - time news conference 12 blocks away at the @entity63			1
last month , @entity2 delivered the @entity5 response following @entity6 's joint address to @entity93			1
the governor was widely panned for his performance , which he addressed tuesday at the top of his speech			0
" many of you have asked that i reprise my @entity101 response speech , " @entity2 said			0
" that was a joke by the way			0
it 's ok to laugh about it			0
" i have just learned that because of president @entity6 's opposition to torture , it is now illegal to show my speech to prisoners at @entity112 , " he added			1
the governor 's speech then took on a serious tone when he emphasized the need for @entity5 to put the 2008 election behind them and embrace the role of loyal opposition party			1
" it 's time to declare our time of introspection and navel - gazing officially over , " @entity2 said			1
" it 's time to get on with the business of charting @entity128 's future			0
so , as of now , be it hereby resolved that we will focus on @entity128 's future , and on standing up for fiscal sanity , before it is too late			0
" with the next presidential election three years away and the fact that he has to face @entity3 voters in 2011 if he seeks re-election , it is not surprising that @entity2 does not publicly express interest in running in 2012			1
but if the governor is considering a presidential bid , he must now focus on learning to become a national candidate and building a political operation			0
unlike potential 2012 rivals such as @entity145 and @entity146 , @entity2 does n't have a national infrastructure in place , nor the experience the two men gained crisscrossing the country in their failed 2008 bids for the @entity63			2
and @entity2 lacks the name recognition of @entity155 gov. @entity154 , a former vice presidential nominee who is said to be considering her own campaign in 2012			1
@entity5 operative @entity157 said it is critical for @entity2 or any other @entity5 candidate to begin amassing a list of national supporters similar to what @entity6 created for the 2008 campaign			1
" it is all about data , " said @entity164 , a former senior aide to the @entity165 , the @entity166 and @entity168 majority leader @entity167			0
" the best candidate in the world is only as good as his database			0
how many cell phone numbers , e-mails and mailing addresses can you collect ? you ca n't collect that in a presidential campaign			0
you have to do that now			0
" @entity164 also said that beyond " fine - tuning his message , " @entity2 needs to continue giving speeches , attending political events and appearing on television if he wants to get used to running for national office			2
at 37 , @entity2 potentially has a long political future , whether or not he runs for president in 2012			2
" there is plenty of time between now and the primaries for him to tighten his game , " said @entity190 , a @entity5 strategist who has worked for former house majority leader @entity191 and the @entity166			2
" he obviously has got a long ways to go before he performs at a presidential level , and particularly at the @entity6 level			2
that is a tall order			0
but @entity2 is an above - average political performer now , and he has plenty of room to grow			2

@entity2 : if @entity6 's *policies* jeopardize @entity44 , nothing wrong in desiring his failure
the @entity3 governor addresses fellow republicans tuesday night
@entity2 has sidestepped whether he will make a presidential run in 2012
