-- they say a week is a long time in politics			0
in today 's febrile world of finance , it 's a lifetime			2
@entity7 's leaders may soon learn that lesson the hard way if they continue to dodge the question on everyone 's lips : what to do if @entity14 is pushed out of the eurozone ? no stranger to unfortunate soubriquets herself , @entity16 has repeatedly refused to address the matter of a @entity21 exit -- or " @entity22 , " as it has been dubbed			1
this week , she cited " political correctness " as her logic for skirting the issue			0
either way , the bosses of some of the eurozone 's biggest companies have decided they ca n't afford the luxury of being caught short			1
with a staff of more than 90,000 to consider and operations in more than 80 countries to oversee , @entity33 ceo @entity32 has admitted that he must plan for what the markets say is an increasingly plausible outcome to a tragedy well into its third year			1
speaking on @entity0 's " @entity42 , " @entity32 said that " one obviously has made provisions " at this stage			2
" i still see it as a low likelihood scenario , but we have done our work over the last few months to prepare ourselves , " he said			1
as high as the stakes are for one of the world 's biggest oil companies , the stakes for heads of government , like @entity16 , are even higher			1
about 320 million people use the euro daily , and as the @entity60 chancellor knows , the integrity of the union is crucial for confidence in its economy -- an economy that just flatlined in the first quarter			0
this invites the question : if it 's so obvious to business leaders , why do @entity7 's elected leaders still shy away from the subject ? @entity70 , partner at the law firm @entity71 , thinks he knows the answer			1
having spent the past two years pondering the possibility of a eurozone member dropping out , @entity70 says the existing legal framework does n't offer a formal escape route			0
the @entity78 treaty does give @entity14 the extreme option of backing out of the @entity78 but not out of its monetary system in itself			2
this means any negotiations would have to be kept quiet			0
" one assumes that a certain amount of contingency work has been done , " @entity70 said , " just that it has been kept secret against the political backdrop that the eurozone must hold together			1
" @entity21 set election date amid possibility of bank panic that view is echoed by former @entity93 and one - time @entity95 trade secretary @entity94			0
" i think it would be better to discuss this behind closed doors			0
otherwise , it would create yet more uncertainty , " he said			0
" in theory you might say : ' its face does n't fit , it 's not performing in the way that others need it to do , its politics are falling apart , its people are miserable ... so why not let it go out ? ' but the consequences of that would shake @entity14 for many , many years to come			1
" since @entity14 went to the polls may 6 , as many as six rate - setters from the @entity116 have openly debated the pros and cons of a common currency minus one troublesome member			1
the word " @entity22 " has made the front page of tabloids and broadsheets in non-eurozone nations like @entity95 for two straight days			0
but bookmaker @entity127 has cut the odds it is offering on @entity14 being the first out of the eurozone to 1 - in - 10 from 1 - in - 8			1
@entity132 , co-founder of @entity133 , says it 's a " really tough call			1
" he says @entity14 's chances of keeping the euro are 50 - 50 and hinge less on political goodwill than financial support from the @entity116			1
" @entity14 means throwing good money after bad , but not saving @entity14 means possible huge and fatal capital outflows from the periphery as well , " he said			2
if that 's the case , @entity132 said , the losses incurred by the central bank could threaten the very institutions set up to safeguard the euro			2
which means keeping @entity14 inside the eurozone could mean a " no euros zone " for its neighbors further down the line			2
so can the tide be turned ? @entity70 reckons the dam has burst			0
" for many years it used to be taboo , but so many people are talking about it , it 's not a possibility that can be ignored anymore , " he said			0
either way , lawyers , hedge fund managers and chief executives are discussing the euro area 's monetary fate , even if those in charge of its member nations are not .			0

the eurozone 's biggest companies make contingency plans for @entity14 's exit
" i still see it as a low likelihood scenario , but we have done our work , " @entity33 's ceo says
@entity7 's elected leaders are saying little , but many *suspect* behind - the - scenes talks
@entity132 sees a 50 - 50 chance of @entity14 staying in the eurozone
