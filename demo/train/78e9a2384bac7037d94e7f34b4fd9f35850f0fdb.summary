" take out the champagne glasses -- wedding bells will soon be ringing in @entity2 ! " that enthusiasm was not shared by everyone			0

" the appeal will be heard in january			0
but the state @entity3 on friday declined to delay the september order in the meantime , writing that " the state has not shown a reasonable probability that it will succeed on the merits " of the appeal			0

" under those circumstances , courts do not have the option to defer			0
" @entity2 has recognized civil unions between same - sex couples since 2007 , after the @entity3 ruled that the state must allow same - sex couples all the rights and benefits of marriage			1
