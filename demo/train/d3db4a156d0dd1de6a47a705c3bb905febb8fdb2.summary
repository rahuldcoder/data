-- @entity1 is a dangerous time for pet dogs in @entity4			1
traditionally the time of peak demand for dog meat in @entity16 , the dog smugglers of the @entity7 work deep into the night shipping thousands of animals -- sometimes dozens to a cage -- across the river border with @entity12 to be trucked on to the dinner tables of the nouveau riche in @entity19			1
" i 'd say about 98 % of them are domesticated -- a lot of them are stolen pets , " says @entity20 of the @entity22 - based @entity21			0
@entity21 is a @entity28 word meaning backstreet or alley			2
" they 've been trained and respond to commands , some of them are even still wearing collars , " he says			0
gathering dogs for market was once simply a matter of exchanging plastic buckets for the many soi dogs that live around @entity28 towns and villages			1
but with demand soaring in the winter months -- dog meat is regarded as a " warming " food and one that is believed to confer good luck in @entity16 -- it 's a sellers ' market			1
" the sheer number of dogs required means this method is no longer sustainable and rustlers will travel across most of @entity4 in search of dogs , " says @entity20			2
others are snatched from streets , temples , and even people 's gardens			0
" the recent floods in @entity4 have also been a boon for dognappers for whom lost and displaced dogs are an easy target			2
some operators simply drive around in pickups collecting dogs as they spot them			0
" one pickup truck stopped in september had 130 dogs in sacks piled in the back , " says @entity20			0
" more than 30 of the dogs were already dead from suffocation			0
" the trade is illegal in @entity4 and while authorities have made a number of raids involving thousands of dogs , the @entity78 estimates as many 500,000 dogs are sold across the @entity7 every year			1
this month , a @entity28 navy patrol rescued 800 dogs packed into 40 wire cages on a six - wheeled truck on the banks of the @entity7 in @entity90			1
police said they made one arrest but the other smugglers disappeared into the night			0
@entity7 patrol unit leader captain @entity94 told @entity28 media that more than 100 empty cages were found at the scene of the raid indicating that at least 2,000 dogs had already been shipped to @entity16			1
once the dogs arrive in @entity16 -- if they have n't died of trauma , suffocation or starvation en route -- a painful death awaits them			2
dog meat aficionados claim that stress hormones tenderize the strong - tasting meat , and killing methods range from beatings to being skinned alive			1
the dogs , especially pedigree breeds , are sometimes shipped on from @entity16 to southern @entity113 where a prime animal will fetch a higher price			2
" we know that @entity117 's are highly prized in southern @entity113 , but you can see all types of pedigree animals in these captured @entity28 shipments -- poodles , shih tzus , you name it , " says @entity20			0
with market prices in @entity16 generally at between 500 - 1000 baht ( $ 16 - 32 ) for a dog that can sometimes be picked up for the price of a plastic bucket or even less , @entity4 's @entity125 has a tough job regulating what has become a booming industry			1
dog traders -- who have mounted counter protests in @entity7 region provinces where the trade flourishes -- claim there is no direct law against the practice			1
smugglers are normally prosecuted under laws that prohibit the illegal trade and transportation of animals			0
while there are no direct animal cruelty laws in @entity4 , prosecutors can charge smugglers with cruelty under @entity150 laws			2
the reality , however , is that smugglers often receive light sentences of just a few months in jail and that the thousands of impounded dogs that end up in quarantine centers sometimes find their way back onto the streets and in the dog meat circle again			1
@entity21 and the @entity159 are currently working through the @entity160 to get an @entity161 through the @entity28 @entity162			0
" this is not about whether it is right or wrong to eat dog meat , " @entity20 says			1
" it is about an illegal trade worth millions of dollars per year organized by criminals			0
" the way in which these dogs are transported and , if they survive , killed , is horrific			0

dog smuggling is booming in @entity4 around the @entity7 border region with @entity12
@entity28 authorities say the trade has been growing thanks to a strong market in @entity16
animal *welfare* *groups* say operators often pick up strays off the street *including* pets
dog meat in @entity16 is regarded as an *auspicious* dish to eat around @entity1
