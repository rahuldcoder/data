a @entity2 family 's nanny nightmare may be nearing an end			1
more than three weeks ago the @entity5 family fired @entity6 , 64 , but she refused to leave their home			1
police told the family they could n't force @entity6 out of their @entity12 , @entity2 , home without an eviction notice			1
a judge even ruled in @entity6 's favor , deciding the @entity5 's did not terminate @entity6 's employment in a legal manner			2
the family said @entity6 then threatened to sue them if they tried to force her out			0
now @entity6 has offered to move out , according to @entity21 , but under her conditions			0
@entity6 called the family 's attorney late saturday night " and said she could be out by july 4 , " @entity23 said on " @entity27 " sunday			1
but @entity23 said that wo n't work for her family because they plan to be out of town			2
so it 's still unclear at this point if , in fact , the nanny will leave of her own free will or whether the family will have to continue through with the eviction process , now underway , before they can call their home their own again			1
" this is now by court , by law , this is her domain , " @entity40 told @entity21			0
the family 's saga started in march when @entity23 hired @entity6 as a nanny , who was expected to help out with household chores			1
the family ran a background check on the woman before hiring her , too			0
@entity23 fired her on june 6			2
" she quit working about a month before i ever fired her			0
she would just stay in her room , " said @entity23			0
@entity54 discovered that @entity6 is on the @entity2 's @entity55 , a list of people who continually bring legal action , regardless of merit , against others with the sole intention of harassment			2
@entity54 found dozens of lawsuits filed by @entity6 in @entity2 over the years .			0
