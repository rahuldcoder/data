-- when we think of economic crises in @entity4 , two periods come to mind -- the @entity6 and whatever it is we 're in the middle of right now			1
but the @entity4 stock market has crashed more times than we 'd like to admit			1
historically , our economy has been brought to its knees by everything from greedy bankers to horse illnesses			2
horses , cows , whales and a failed copper scheme caused economic panics earlier in @entity4 history			1
so let 's take a deep breath and remember that panics are just part of the @entity4 way of life			1
the panic of 1873 : @entity4 stops horsing around during the late 19th century , the @entity4 economy relied on horses the way it depends on gas today			1
horses unloaded cargo from ports , transported goods from city to city , worked the farms , supported the army , and served as the emergency vehicles of choice			2
without them , the @entity4 workforce would have ground to a halt			1
and that 's exactly what happened in 1872 , when an estimated 99 percent of all horses in @entity4 contracted equine influenza			1
the highly contagious strain started in @entity52 and spread through @entity53 to the @entity54 in a matter of months , leaving horses across the country too weak to stand and coughing uncontrollably			2
street buggies stopped running , paralyzing commerce in the cities			0
railroads were stymied because trains run on coal -- coal that was hauled out of mines by horses			1
and as the horse flu spread , @entity4 military troops had to go into battle on foot ( they were fighting @entity71 at the time )			1
more tragically , a fire in @entity74 raged for three days because there were no horses to carry water			2
the flames destroyed more than 700 buildings , causing an estimated $ 73.5 million in damages and killing at least 20 people			2
the " @entity83 , " as it was called , spiraled out of control in less than a year			0
at the height of the panic , as many as 20,000 businesses failed , a third of all railroads went bankrupt , and unemployment spiked to almost 15 percent			2
the economy took nearly a decade to recover			2
ironically , nearly all of the horses recuperated by the following spring			0
the winter of 1886 : when the cows do n't come home during the second half of the 19th century , cattle ranches in the @entity97 were thriving			1
from the @entity101 grasslands to the @entity103 prairie , ranches were attracting investors back @entity105 and across the pond in @entity107			0
but by 1886 , things were getting dicey			1
overgrazing , coupled with a hot and dry summer , had left the plains almost bare			1
known as the " @entity113 , " the following season saw one of the worst cold spells in recorded history			0
more than half the cattle in the @entity97 froze to death , unable to move in the thick snow			1
ghoulish firsthand accounts describe the bodies of dead cows stretching for miles across the horizon			0
when the spring thaw and floods came , thousands of bloated corpses floated into the streams and rivers			0
some ranchers quit the business entirely and did n't even bother to round up their surviving cattle			1
@entity0 : bold business scams that failed miserably by the end of 1887 , the disaster had wiped out more than half of the @entity4 ' western cattle and debilitated the national economy			1
most cattle investors went bankrupt , and thousands of cowboys were left unemployed			0
but more than anything , the winter of 1886 put an end to all those turn - of - the - century , idyllic fantasies of open - range ranching in the @entity145			1
the panic of 1907 : captains of industry to the rescue ! the panic of 1907 started the way many panics do , with a greedy capitalist			0
multimillionaire @entity154 , who had made his fortune mining in @entity101 , believed he had enough control over the copper industry to corner the market			0
with the help of several major banks , he concocted a scheme to buy up all the shares of @entity163			1
but @entity154 had overestimated his prowess , and the scheme failed , bringing down @entity154 , @entity163 , the banks , and many , many stockholders			1
@entity0 : who is ponzi and what was his scheme ? the debacle sent ripples of anxiety throughout the market , and investors started pulling their money out of banks altogether			1
after one of @entity180 's biggest trusts went under , panic ensued , and the stock market collapsed			0
at the time , there were no central banks in place , so the federal government had no means of bailing out businesses or injecting cash into the economy			1
it just stood by , idly waiting for a hero to save the day			0
@entity192 , banker extraordinaire , rescued the @entity4 economy			1
he propped up many of the failing banks in @entity180 by twisting the arms of other financiers , and he assuaged investors ' fears by backing up the market with his own vast cash reserves			0
before long , @entity203 was on the mend			0
the government also learned its lesson			0
with the panic resolved , it created the @entity209 , ensuring that it could buttress the economy during hard times			2
since then , the government has taken a more active role in financial matters and relied less on the kindness of robber barons			0
whale of a crisis : the collapse of @entity4 's first oil industry during the early 19th century , @entity4 was one of the top oil - producing countries in the world			2
but it was n't petroleum the nation was exporting ; it was whale oil			0
by the mid- 1800s , the high - risk , high - profit business was the fifth - largest industry in the @entity4			1
mental floss : 6 things you probably do n't know about oil at its height , the @entity4 whaling industry produced more than 10 million gallons of oil a year and sold it for $ 1.77 a gallon ( about $ 35 per gallon today )			1
better still , an @entity4 fleet of 1,000 ships had exclusive access to the @entity244 territories , which ensured profits			2
what could have stopped such a juggernaut of an industry ? for one thing , other sources of oil			0
in 1846 , @entity52 geologist @entity252 developed a technique for distilling kerosene from petroleum , and within a few decades , kerosene had replaced whale oil as the most popular fuel for lamps			0
another reason for the decline was that the whales were dying off			0
the enthusiastic slaughter throughout the 1800s drove some whale species to extinction and put others on the brink			0
with so few left to hunt , the cost of whaling became prohibitively expensive			0
the final blow to whalers came during the harsh winter of 1871 , when the @entity244 ice trapped and crushed the bulk of the @entity4 fleet			1
although @entity4 consumers did n't suffer as the country switched from whale oil to petroleum , coastal towns in @entity53 and the @entity279 languished , and shipbuilders and fishermen found themselves out of work			2
by the time of the @entity289 , whaling ships had become so worthless that @entity291 soldiers loaded a fleet of them with stones and sank them into @entity296 harbor			0
the hope was to blockade the @entity54 from the port , but when the plan did n't work , the ships were no great loss			0
@entity4 's first oil industry had been tapped out			2
