the risk of a nuclear confrontation between nations has gone down , but the risk of nuclear attack has gone up			2

president @entity25 has said that he 'll travel to @entity75 for the president and first lady 's funeral			1
@entity82 @entity83 , @entity14 : see if you can i.d. me ! i was born in @entity86 , @entity87 in 1964			2
i graduated from @entity88 and got my law degree from @entity90			2
i have two daughters : @entity92 and @entity93			2
i 'm first lady @entity94 , the country 's first @entity95 first lady			1
@entity94 @entity37 : right now , @entity94 is on her first official , solo trip as first lady			1
she arrived in @entity5 yesterday for a three - day visit there			1

" while she is there , mrs. @entity94 will meet with the first lady of @entity5 , tour different cultural museums , and give a speech at a local university			1

offer of resignation @entity37 : in @entity121 , @entity120 , the president of @entity6 , says that he is willing to resign , but only if he and his relatives are allowed to leave the country safely			2
@entity6 has been going through some political turmoil recently			0
and when protesters took over the main government building , @entity120 left the capital city and a temporary government took over			0
some officials in that new government would be just fine with @entity120 leaving @entity6			0
others think the president should have to stay and be held accountable for what they say are criminal actions			0
charges have been filed against some of his relatives and associates			0
but @entity120 says he does n't recognize any decisions made by the interim government			0
@entity143 @entity37 : " do n't buy : safety risk			0
" it 's a warning that @entity146 does n't make too often			1
but it is making that warning about a sport utility vehicle made by @entity150			0
the @entity152 , you see right here , during a severe turn , it slides almost completely sideways			0
@entity146 says that 's because a system that should stop the slide does n't kick in in time , and that could cause a rollover			1
that 's why the magazine issued the rare " do n't buy " warning			1
the last one of those was given out , in 2001			0
@entity162 , which owns @entity150 , said it 'll conduct its own tests to see what steps need to be taken			0

april 14 , 1910 - president @entity173 throws out the first pitch at a @entity176 baseball game , starting the tradition of presidents throwing out first pitches			0
@entity180 @entity181 , @entity14 : time for the shoutout ! the word " olfactory " refers to what sense ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity191 , c ) taste or @entity193 ) sight ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! you might have sniffed out that olfactory refers to your sense of smell			0
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! sniffing for explosives @entity37 : it comes in handy with flowers or food			1
but experts say our sense of smell can also work like a warning system			0
kind of an olfactory alarm			0
that 's also why dogs are sometimes used to sniff out danger			1
their sense of smell can be a thousand times more sensitive than ours			0
and as @entity221 explains , what their nose knows could help save lives			0
( begin video ) @entity224 , @entity226 homeland security correspondent : a dog 's nose samples the air many times a second			1
this dog sniffs it for explosives			0
@entity233 is what 's called a " vapor wake " dog , trained to pick up the scent of explosives in the air despite crowds , cross currents and other smells in @entity244 's @entity243			1
her nose can ferret out @entity246 , @entity247 and other explosives in a huge space , even though a person carrying them may have passed by as much as 15 minutes earlier			0
the head of @entity254 's k - 9 program compares these animals to a top athlete			1
@entity258 @entity257 , @entity260 k - 9 program : @entity262 , and the reason why i say that is because @entity262 is one of the best basketball players of all time , and these vapor wake dogs , i put in that same category			1
@entity224 : only 1 or 2 percent of puppies from @entity271 's breeding program have what it takes to be a vapor wake dog			1
@entity275 , manager , @entity276 : they 'll hunt and hunt and hunt and wo n't come back without it			0
@entity224 : they are introduced at an early age to slippery surfaces and a variety of environments before being sent to prisons in @entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 , where inmates begin training the dogs to use their noses			1
back at the @entity271 facility , older dogs are conditioned on a souped - up golf cart to handle the rigors of their future jobs			1
they recognize about a dozen explosives and could be trained to find additional ones in just a day or two			1
i take a backpack containing explosives into a building to test a dog			0
i walk , sit and walk some more			0
so now , i 'm going to hide this backpack full of smokeless powder right here			0
a minute later , @entity307 , still in the early stages of training , tracks the explosive scent right to the source			0
@entity312 , @entity313 : there are certain chefs who 'll smell a pot of stew and say , " oh , that 's oregano , or that 's this type of spice			1
" the dog walks into it , smells this whole thing and says , " oh , that 's @entity324			1
" @entity224 : the @entity325 are just starting to use vapor wake dogs			1
they 've already augmented security at sporting events and other large gatherings			1
but @entity254 has embraced them despite the $ 20,000 price tag per dog			0
the rail carrier believes that in a high - risk , ever - changing transit environment , the dogs have advantages over machines , even though they can only work for about 90 minutes at a stretch			1
@entity341 , @entity342 : there 's nothing like a dog as far as mobility , as far as how quickly it can detect explosives and take us to the source of it			1
and the cost is basically less than any type of technology out there			0
( @entity356 ) blog report @entity37 : @entity358 is a student who 's talking to us on our blog about college			1
we asked what those of you who are planning to go to college hope to get out of it , and @entity358 asked , " how would you like to be operated on by an uneducated doctor or taught by a teacher who did n't go to college ? we need to go to get higher education , jobs and to help others			0
" @entity373 says he wants to go to college so he can get a job more easily and that it could help him make more money			0
he 's right ! so is @entity377			1
she says " college is a place where we learn about what we want to be			1
i 'm not saying it 's the only way , but it 's one way to get a career in life			2
" @entity385 writes , " i do n't just want to go to make sure i get a job right out of college			0
i would go because i want a higher education			0
" what would you want out of college ? tell us , using only your first name -- your first name is all we want to see -- at @entity395			0
before we go @entity37 : before we go , we want you to check out the ultimate garden guardian			0
it 's 15 feet tall			2
the world 's tallest garden gnome ! okay , actually , it 's the second tallest			2
it was designed to be the biggest , but then about a month before it debuted , an 18 - footer showed up in @entity75			0
but wait , all is not lost			0
the other one is made out of fiberglass			0
so , say hello to the world 's tallest concrete garden gnome ! might not be a record			2
goodbye @entity37 : but the thing is still phe - gnome - inaly impressive			0
just your garden - variety pun , but it 'll do			0
