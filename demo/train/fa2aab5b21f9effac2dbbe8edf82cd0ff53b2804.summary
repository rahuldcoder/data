-- if buttons are a thing of the past and touch screens are the present , what are the screens of the future ? it 's not a riddle , but it is a trick question : if the projections of companies like @entity12 are true then the screens of the future wo n't be screens at all but interactive images floating in mid-air			1
according to @entity20 designer @entity19 , creator of @entity12 , high - tech displays made from mist and air are " the next step in visual technology "			1
tired with " electronic junk " such as tv sets and monitors , @entity19 wanted to invent something that would allow people to display and interact with information without cluttering the physical environment			0
his solution ? projecting 3d images onto sheets of mist , giving the illusion of a hologram : " an airstream is created from tiny water drops , similar to the ones in the clouds			2
the water drops are so tiny they do n't have any moisture in them ; you can test it on paper or your glasses -- your piece of paper will remain dry and your glasses wo n't steam up			2
we can then see images that are projected onto these tiny water drops , " he explains			0
with the technology consisting of air , water and light @entity12 is one of the simpler concepts in the burgeoning holographic and 3d projection industry			1
" i realised that everything already exists in nature and everything that people create comes from nature : we just need to watch it carefully and you will soon get your answers			0
" with @entity12 , users need not wear special glasses as with many other new screen systems because the image is being displayed onto an invisible screen ; and that screen responds " intuitively " to hand movements -- 1500 of them -- many of which are similar to those used on our mobile devices , such as pinch - and - zoom			1
today the technology is being used in advertising by big companies such as @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 , but @entity19 can see practical applications elsewhere , such as in medicine			2
" a heart surgeon could see in the air a patient 's heart and could blow it up and search for information immediately without having to wash his hands			0
" the screen - free display comes at a time when concerns are emerging over the hygiene of digital multi-touch displays : " by creating @entity12 we have developed a product which can be used as a public terminal for extracting necessary information such as timetables and restaurant menus , " says @entity19			1
" it means that in the future when bigger displays are created numerous people can use @entity12 at the same time , play games and search for information			1
" projecting forward , @entity19 says that in the future he and his team hope to explore scent , to offer users a multi-sensory experience			0
for now though , he says the basic technology needs further refinement to improve the picture quality and interaction speed			0
