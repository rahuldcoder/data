i know what you 're thinking : what do @entity3 and i have in common ? first , we 're both responsible for bringing sexy back			0
second , we 're both standing up to cancer on friday			1
why ? well , i do n't know @entity3 's connection to cancer , but i do know mine			1
i lost both of my grandfathers , an uncle and numerous friends to cancer			1
additionally , my mother is a cancer survivor			2
( @entity14 , uterine cancer , and then kidney cancer			2
) and i know that all the stars who are coming out friday night and all the viewers at home have been personally touched by cancer in some way			1
they 've seen the havoc the disease can wreak on a person 's life , family , friends and immune system			1
no matter who you are , how wealthy you are , how famous you are , cancer will find a way into your life , affecting you or someone you love			2
every day , 1,600 @entity34 die from cancer			2
eight million people worldwide will die this year from the disease			0
in the @entity34 , one in every two men and one out of every three women will be diagnosed with some form of cancer in their lifetimes			2
@entity42 is a movement designed to get top researchers from the best medical centers focused on highly specialized projects aimed at bringing new treatments to people faster and making everyone diagnosed with cancer a survivor			1
we 're gearing up for a national election , yet it 's rare to hear leaders from either major political party say anything about cancer			1
we , the people , must			0
it 's why for years now , i 've " spontaneously " showed up at baseball games and other events to support cancer research and on the friday after @entity64 , i put on one of those fancy t - shirts and stand up to cancer with my friends from film , tv , music and sports			1
say what you want about the entertainment industry ( and , really , what has n't been said ? ) but on this one , we 're getting it right			1
for all the issues and problems facing us all right now , this is one of the most pressing			0
it 's also one of the most promising			2
scientists and doctors are genuinely excited about the progress in the fight against the disease			0
certain cancers have higher survival rates than others			0
by having dedicated dream teams of scientists collaborating in an unprecedented manner and studying the connections between certain types of cancers , those kinds of cancer with lower survival rates have been put on notice			2
( that 's right , pancreatic cancer , your days are numbered			1
) during friday 's broadcast , you will hear first - hand from patients bravely participating in clinical trials and scientists on the front lines of the war against the disease , and your favorite movie stars will share stories of real people , just like my mom , who went through hell and back because of cancer			1
but after all , we are the entertainment industry , and therefore you will be entertained by the likes of @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 and @entity121			1
( i personally picked the music			0
) but even with an incredible lineup of stars that includes @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 , one of our executive producers @entity130 and @entity34 's newest sweethearts , olympic gold medalists @entity132 and @entity134 , there will still be cynics out there			2
from the hopeless : " @entity42 will never be cured			1
why bother ? " to the apathetic : " the war on cancer is decades old			0
why bother ? " to those whose sole purpose in life is to point fingers : " cancer is all a matter of lifestyle			0
why bother ? " to the conspiracy theorists : " the drug companies do n't really want a cure for cancer			0
why bother ? " to these people , i say , " @entity42			1
" we have been finding cures for diseases since the beginning of time			0
polio was decades old before the @entity162 movement , initially broadcast on radio , galvanized a country to find a cure			0
to those who think cancer is solely a byproduct of unhealthy living , i say healthy people get cancer , too			0
and to those conspiracy theorists out there , i am reminded of something @entity42 's co-founder @entity175 used to say : " the people who work at drug companies get cancer , too			1
so do their mothers , wives , husbands , sons and daughters			0
they want it to end , like the rest of us			0
" so now is our time			0
pull up a chair ( i recommend bringing a box of @entity190 or two with you ) , turn on just about any channel on tv friday night and at some point go to su2c.org and give what you can			1
so that one day your grandkids or your great - grandkids will ask you , " what is cancer ? " and you 'll proudly say , " something of the past			1
and boy , ' @entity204 ' was a helluva show			0
" follow @ @entity206 on twitter			0

@entity211 , backed by entertainment industry , *funds* research
