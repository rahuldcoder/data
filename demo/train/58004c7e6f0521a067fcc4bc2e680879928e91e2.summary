-- i got chills -- not once but several times -- during tuesday 's @entity4 with five women named to the @entity0 10 : visionary women list			1
the panel of women from truly diverse backgrounds provided fertile ground for discussion around the theme : what 's the future of women at work ? @entity17 , who has devoted her life to helping the homeless reenter the work world , got personal about growing up in a family " constantly struggling in poverty " and watching what it does to parents " when they 're constantly afraid			1
" " there 's anger			2
they do n't know when they 're going to feed their kids next			2
they do n't know if they can afford rent , " she said			0
equally powerful was @entity36 , a one - time single mom on welfare now committed to helping struggling women get access to cars so they can work			1
" i know what it 's like to be there and paying for @entity44 presents with food stamps			0
" and , @entity50 , on a lifelong mission to eliminate the pay gap between men and women , spoke movingly about a press conference she attended early in her career about gender bias in the courts			1
" i thought , if we ca n't get justice through the place you 're supposed to go to get justice , there is n't justice for women consistently in a meaningful way			1
" yep , pinch me now , because when you bring five passionate and community - minded women together who are focused on lifting up the lives of other women , you can not help but be inspired about the future for our young girls			1
here are five takeaways from the chat			0
lean on , not only lean in mentoring takes many forms , the women said			1
it may be women who are already in the tech field serving as role models for young girls , said @entity84 , founder and executive director of @entity86 , which teaches coding and entrepreneurship to girls of color			1
but it can also be girls mentoring each other			1
" so the girls that are 9 to 10 become mentors for the girls that are 7 to 8 , and the girls that are 13 to 15 , and 17 and 18 become the mentors for girls that are in middle school , " said @entity95			1
" and we hope that this pipeline will continue to build , and this network and community of support will continue to build once the girls leave @entity86 and go on to college and then enter the work force			1
" @entity114 built her entire organization , the women 's @entity115 , for female tech company founders , around the idea of two people leaning on each other , symbolized by the @entity122 pictograph letter hito , which means human			1
" many of the founders might be going through the same things or same stage , but they have very , very different experiences			0
and ( this ) is a very safe place for them to really open up			0
' hey , i feel like i 'm giving up , i do n't know how to do it			0
' " with mentors , persistence also pays off , said @entity50 , executive director of the women and @entity135 at the @entity136			1
early in her career , when a former @entity139 chief in @entity140 encouraged her to call him about an idea , she did , again and again			0
" i must have called him 20 times before he and i connected ... but i kept at it and i think sometimes it takes just thinking it 's ok to keep at it			1
" you have to see it to be it " to many in the audience , one of the most powerful aspects of the @entity0 10 : @entity153 is how all 10 women are helping other women			1
" so great to see women supporting women instead of impeding their progress by being territorial , " wrote @entity156 , a retired principal who is now ceo of an education consulting firm , on my @entity159 page			2
@entity164 - @entity163 , founder of the @entity165 , believes the way to keep women from getting in each other 's way is by showing what happens when they do n't			1
" success begets success , " she said			0
" you have to see it before you can be it , and so the only way that you can convince women that supporting women is a good deal is to support other women			2
" @entity50 says when she trains students at @entity136 or at other locations around the world , she asks them to take a pledge			0
when someone calls and asks if they know a good person , they pledge to recommend a " competent , qualified woman , " said @entity50			0
the second pledge ? " i will not speak ill of other women , " she said			2
" if you do n't have something nice to say , do n't say it			0
get men involved women supporting women is key , the five innovators said , but so is getting men to understand why it 's crucial they support women too			1
" what i would really love to see is for every man to look at his seven year old daughter sitting across the table from him at dinner tonight and say i want that little girl to do whatever she wants to do			0
i want her to walk into any industry she wants to take on and i want her to thrive because i love that little girl , " said @entity36			0
on a practical note , @entity50 added : " to compete in the 21st century , we are not going to be able to hire just out of 48 or 49 percent of the talent pool			0
" @entity114 says she sometimes faces accusations of discrimination from men for having a women 's startup lab. " it is okay for women to come together and find their strength and the support structure			2
and we 're not making a statement against the men			0
risk - taking and femininity are not mutually exclusive women can also hold themselves back , the women said			1
@entity227 talked of the " stereotype threat that we internalize as women ... when we enter these environments which are not very diverse , and which lack women , that maybe we do n't belong			1
" instead , what she says she finds , especially in industries heavily dominated by men , is that women generally come to the table much more prepared			2
" we 're often more qualified and more competent than our male counterparts by far , " she added			0
@entity164 - @entity163 longs for the day when skills are viewed as gender neutral			2
" i have so many friends of mine who are daring , crazy , analytical ... some of them male , some of them female ...			2
you can be risk - taking and feminine			1
they 're not mutually exclusive			1
" and , when we see a woman feeling true empowerment , there just is n't anything quite like it			2
" one of our women ... she flat out in front of a ( television ) camera said , ' you should be inspired by me			1
do n't pity me because i 've come from being homeless			0
you should be inspired by the fact that i am here standing in front of you right now , ' " said @entity261 , founder and ceo of @entity263 , an organization providing jobs to the homeless			0
the personal is powerful for nearly all of the @entity0 10 : visionary women participating in yesterday 's @entity4 , their professional passions are personal			1
" @entity263 was just me creating something i wish had been given to my parents as an opportunity , " said @entity261 , who has built a business teaching homeless women to sew coats for the homeless			2
she shared a recent success story : a single mom with three kids under the age of 12 who within three months of learning how to sew , moved out of the homeless shelter , found an apartment , and got her kids in charter schools with her youngest learning @entity122			0
" that was just the ' @entity293 ! ' moment , " said @entity261 , realizing she had come full circle			0
" i was that kid who was constantly struggling			0
" @entity164 - @entity163 knows exactly how it feels to struggle as a former welfare mom , trying to find a job and complete an associate 's degree without a car			2
" who better to tell a woman , ' i know you can do it			0
i 've done it ? ' " she said			0
" nobody gets where they are supposed to be by themselves			0
" what do you think are the biggest issues facing women in the work force ? @entity316 in below in the comments of tell @entity318 on @entity319 and @entity320 on @entity159 .			1

women mentoring other women is key for empowerment , the women say
" risk - taking and feminine ... not mutually exclusive , " said one of the women
