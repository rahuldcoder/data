" @entity4 are more than a club and a great team and i want to help @entity6 to continue to be the greatest player in the world , " he was quoted as saying by @entity4 's official website			2
the words may be seen as an attempt to dampen speculation as to how the 21 - year - old signing from @entity2 side @entity18 will fare alongside the four - time @entity19			1
@entity4 legend @entity20 recently stoked the debate when stressing a need to learn from the past as he discussed @entity1 's arrival , saying he would not put " two captains on the same ship			1
" despite his widespread reputation as one of the greatest players in footballing history , @entity6 has not been averse to criticism from some teammates in years gone by			0
in his 2011 biography , @entity33 complained that the end of his @entity4 career began when @entity6 told then coach @entity37 that he wanted to play centrally , rather than on the wing , so forcing the @entity39 to play out of position			0
the striker was an expensive flop after joining in 2009 and the present @entity4 hierarchy will hope that the $ 75 million spent on @entity1 will work out far better than the similar amount splashed on @entity33 , who lasted just a year at the club			1
" there are big question marks as to how @entity1 will fit into the team as there is already one god , or demigod , at @entity4 in @entity6 , " @entity53 football expert @entity52 told @entity0			1
" there is potential tension			0
@entity20 has said in recent days that you can not have two captains but other people are being more generous			0
" i think he is going to introduce a necessary element of dynamism to a @entity4 that showed signs of flagging in the season just past , and who were utterly destroyed by @entity65 in the @entity67 semifinals			2
" beaten 7 - 0 over two legs in the semifinals of this year 's competition by the eventual winners , @entity4 can at least reflect on a more than satisfactory league campaign			1
they reclaimed the title off last year 's champions @entity74 in convincing fashion , winning @entity76 by a record 15 points over their bitter rivals			2
@entity4 also registered 32 victories and reached 100 points for the first time in a league campaign following saturday 's 4 - 1 defeat of @entity84			2
" i 'm very happy to be a @entity4 player			0
i 'm very excited , i 've realized a dream			0
thank you so much , " said @entity1 after walking out into @entity4 's stadium accompanied by a group of children and the club 's hymn			1
" it is an honor to play alongside the best player in the world in @entity6			0
it should be easier to play alongside him because he is the best , " he added later			0
he was greeted by over 56,000 fans , with the @entity4 website commenting that " very few players ( had ) garnered this much attention from the @entity105 faithful			2
" the @entity106 international , who flew overnight from @entity109 after playing in sunday 's 2 - 2 draw with @entity111 , put pen to paper on his contract on monday after passing a medical			0
@entity1 -- whose full name is @entity117 -- signed a deal that is set to keep him at the club until 2018			2
any suitors potentially interested in luring the @entity2 away will have to stump up a staggering transfer fee after @entity4 announced that his buyout clause is $ 248 million			1
@entity4 vice president @entity124 revealed on monday that @entity4 had planned to bring in @entity1 next year only to have to move the deal forward in light of competition for his signature from @entity74 and another unnamed club			1
" the operation has been made more expensive due to the interest of other clubs that interfered in the signing of @entity1 , " he said			0

to bring the move forward , we have had to pay $ 22 million more			0
" in total , the deal cost @entity4 $ 75 million , with the club having already made a down payment of $ 13 million last year			1
@entity1 himself said he had always targeted a move to @entity4 despite the attempts made by their great rivals @entity74			1
