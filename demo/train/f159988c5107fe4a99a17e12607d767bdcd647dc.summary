@entity0 @entity3 's @entity2 turned off its lights monday in a symbolic rejection of an @entity7 rally taking place in its shadow			1
the protest group " patriotic @entity17 against the @entity18 , " or @entity19 , called for people to take to the streets at 5:30 p.m. ( 6:30 p.m. gmt ) monday in the cities of @entity2 , @entity14 and the @entity3 capital @entity16			1
it follows a december 22 protest in @entity22 during which the city 's opera house -- @entity25 -- turned its lights on and off to signify its rejection of @entity19			1
@entity25 has a banner reading " refugees are welcome here " as its main profile image on @entity32			0
in a @entity32 post december 30 , @entity2 provost @entity33 said monday 's protest would " certainly not take place in the light of the cathedral			1
" following the example of the @entity25 , @entity33 said , " the @entity2 will be shrouded in darkness			1
" " @entity41 will not be a backdrop for this demonstration , " he said			0
" as a highly visible protest against xenophobia , racism and exclusion , the outdoor lighting of @entity2 will therefore be turned off on january 5 for the period of the demonstration			1
" on its @entity32 page , @entity19 says citizens should " wake from their slumber " and recognize the " danger in the @entity58 ideology			0
" " stop the radical @entity59 " it urges			0
" as a society , we should give people the chance to integrate , but we should not allow ourselves to be islamized thereby losing our freedom and democracy ! " @entity3 state broadcaster @entity66 reported that more than 17,000 people participated in the @entity22 rally last month , where they were met by some 4,000 counterprotesters			1
police in @entity2 said they would have an increased presence in light of monday 's planned protests , with several hundred officers set to be on the city 's streets			1
meanwhile , @entity1 's @entity78 in @entity16 said that @entity19 protesters in the capital were likely to number in the hundreds and be met by thousands of counterprotesters			1
a poll by @entity3 newspaper @entity84 in december found that 34 % of respondents believed their country was becoming " increasingly islamicized			1
" @entity3 interior minister @entity88 told @entity1 's @entity89 monday that he was " worried by this tendency " but the significance of the protests should not be overestimated			1
" it 's new , it 's concerning , but we should not be dominated by @entity19 when we discuss our political agenda , " he said			0
on the other hand , he said protesters posed some questions that needed to be answered			0
" they ask : ' is there an end of asylum seekers , how dangerous is @entity58 for our society , what about the fight against @entity108 ( @entity109 ) -- can this be successful ? ' these critical questions have to be faced , have to be answered , " de @entity100 said			0
but he said he did not fear a rise of ugly nationalism in @entity3 again			2
" i 'm confident we are strong , " he said			0
" we learned our lessons from the @entity115 years and you can see it 's very interesting that the organizations of @entity19 , they know exactly where the red line is which they should not cross -- this makes me more skeptical but they know where the taboos are in @entity3 so i do n't see a renewal of the @entity126 ( the far - right @entity127 ) -- it 's less than in other @entity17 countries			1
and we are very well aware of it and we will fight against every tendency			0
" @entity100 said @entity3 was in the process of changing its asylum laws : " we say yes to immigration in our interests , we say yes to our humanitarian responsibility towards asylum seekers and we say no to those who only come because of economic reasons , " he said			2
@entity141 said the criminal organizations trafficking people into @entity17 needed to be stopped			2
" we have to get the people ready to welcome real refugees and we have to fight against these criminal organizations			0
" in her @entity148 's speech , @entity3 chancellor @entity146 addressed the issue of xenophobia , urging citizens not to attend such rallies			2
such demonstrations encourage the exclusion of people because of their skin color or religion , she said			2
@entity146 urged people not to attend such demonstrations , where people have " hatred in their hearts , " she said			2
" we know the value of unity in our country , " she said			0
" it is the foundation of our success			0
