@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 and prime minister @entity4 asked their respective parties to shun violence on friday , a rare expression of unity between the political rivals			1
it came after disturbances sunday between @entity3 's @entity14 party and @entity4 's @entity15 in @entity16 near the capital of @entity0			1
about 30 @entity15 supporters were injured after suspected @entity14 militia had disrupted a rally where @entity4 was scheduled to speak			1
the two men have different takes on who might be to blame for the violence			0
@entity4 accused the police chief , @entity24 , an ally of @entity3 , of asking police to protect only @entity14 supporters			1
@entity3 defended police , saying @entity15 had barred officers from attending its events			1
but both want citizens to embrace peace			0
" i am happy the president is with us , " @entity4 said			1
" i have brought before him the issues of violence			0
i have brought before him the blood unnecessarily shed in our communities simply because of one is @entity14 and the other is @entity15 , " he said			1
" i told him about the @entity16 violence			0
... the police watched and to date there is no single arrest			0

the men , now partners in a fragile coalition government , said they want @entity1 's next elections to be peaceful			2
in 2008 , political violence ahead of the presidential run - off resulted in @entity4 pulling out , citing violent attacks and intimidation by the militia of @entity3 's faction			1
