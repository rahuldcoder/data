editor 's note : @entity2 is director of the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5			1
he is the author of " @entity6 : a @entity7 to the @entity8 " ( @entity9 , @entity10 , 2005 ) , " crime signals : how to spot a criminal before you become a victim " ( @entity9 , 2008 ) , and the forthcoming " @entity15 : sightreading the @entity16 , and @entity17			2
" his online nonverbal dictionary is used around the world as a reference tool			2
@entity22 and @entity23 celebrate winning the @entity25 nomination with a fist bump in 2008			1
@entity4 , @entity5 ( @entity27 ) -- the @entity29 swine flu virus is putting our most familiar gesture of greeting -- handshakes -- at risk			1
as an anthropologist who watches people for a living , i can tell you that human beings touch their own faces with their own fingertips hundreds , if not thousands of times a day			1
repeated face touching -- especially finger contact with eyelids , lips , and nostrils -- is as predictable as blinking			2
you 'll observe hand - to - face gestures in every culture and society , as well as in our closest primate relatives , the monkeys and apes			0
there 's nothing wrong with face touching			0
nothing , that is , unless you 're afraid of germs			0
and today , many of us around the world are terrified by these tiny organisms , especially ones that cause swine flu			1
merely by shaking the hand of someone infected by the swine - flu virus , we risk infection each time we inadvertently reach up and touch our faces			1
physicians urge that we wash right after shaking hands			0
but since the anthropologist in me knows that , as a primate , you 'll touch your face before washing , germs will inevitably visit unsuspecting lids , lip , and noses			0
the human handshake itself , meanwhile , is a widespread gesture used for meeting , greeting , and sealing a deal			1
it 's a ritualized gripping of another 's hand , with one or more up - and - down ( or , in @entity91 , sideways ) motions followed by a quick release			0
since the fingertips and palm of the hand are exquisitely sensitive , the shake itself can be deeply personal			0
we instantly feel the warmth or coolness , dryness or moistness , and firmness or weakness of another 's grip			0
sensory input from a hand 's thermal and pressure receptors to the brain 's sensory cortex and then to deeper , emotional brain areas can be intense			0
if you travel to @entity116 , be prepared to shake hands dozens of times a day			0
office workers in @entity121 , for example , may shake in the morning to greet , and in the afternoon to say goodbye , to colleagues			1
outside vendors and technicians will handshake with everyone present when they enter or leave an office			0
the risk of hand - carried flu virus is thus greater here than it is in the @entity130 , where handshaking is far less frequent			1
contrast this to the @entity134 practice of giving fewer handshakes , still , in favor of polite bows of the head			2
in all three nations , casual face touching is frequent , but germs in @entity142 are less apt to spread through handshakes			2
in @entity145 nations , it is strictly taboo for men to shake hands in public with women			0
so , @entity151 couples are less likely to exchange swine - flu germs through manual contact than are business men and women in , say , @entity156 , @entity5			2
since in much of the world a handshake is both a visual and a tactile index of your concern for other people , it 's hard to hold one back			2
in @entity167 , @entity168 , and @entity169 , when someone holds out a hand , it 's difficult not to just take a step forward and shake			0
you do n't want , after all , to seem rude			0
in @entity173 , @entity174 , and the @entity175 , handshaking may be more nuanced than in the @entity176 , or even absent			0
an @entity173 namast√© , with your palms and fingers pressed together in front of your chest , given with a slight bow -- or a @entity151 salaam , in which your right hand touches your forehead , also given with a slight bow , may be proffered instead of a handshake			0
while you 'll see the same incidence of facial touching -- to wipe a lip , relieve tension , or scratch an itch -- the fingertips themselves wo n't carry germs born of handshakes			2
so , what are we face - touchers in the rest of the world to do ? are we doomed to spread flu germs through our practice of ritually of gripping each other 's hands ? the short answer is no. thanks to a pair of the planet 's most well known human primates , we now have a healthier hand sign with which to meet and greet			1
since the @entity23 - lama " fist bumps " have been so well publicized of late , i 'm sure you 've seen it in newspapers and magazines and on web sites and tv			1
primates are the most imitative of all of @entity222 's animals , so do n't be surprised if you find yourself bumping fists -- a lot -- in the weeks and months ahead			0
on september 22 , 2009 , the @entity225 was welcomed to @entity226 , not with a handshake but with a fist bump from interim @entity226 mayor @entity229			1
the exiled @entity231 spiritual leader balled up his fist and reached it forward to make friendly contact with the mayor 's own proffered balled - up fist			2
from his smiling face , i could tell the @entity225 enjoyed his new greeting ritual			1
it looked as if he were playing with the cue			0
though it was unclear if either of the fist - bumpers had flu phobia , that they touched with the knuckles instead of the fingertips rendered disease transmission far less likely			1
a year earlier , on june 3 , 2008 , then - @entity248 sen. @entity247 tenderly fist bumped with his wife @entity249 , in what the @entity250 called " the fist bump heard ' round the world			1
" that a @entity130 president publicly performed the fist bump -- a gesture that originated partly from the sportsman 's palm high - slap of victory and partly from the @entity261 fist of the 1970s -- has given the gesture staying power , even though some people were critical of its use			1
it will last considerably longer than @entity269 's " 15 minutes of fame			0
" thanks to @entity247 , the @entity225 , and the swine flu , the fist bump will surely show up at a greeting near you			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity277 .			1

@entity277 : @entity29 flu is prompting focus on how we greet each other
he says handshakes create risk of spreading the flu virus
fist bumps are a less risky way of greeting people
@entity2 : @entity293 and @entity225 have *popularized* the fist bump
