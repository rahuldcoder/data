-- when a black man dies at the hands of a white police officer , not often is there video evidence that could end the speculation and show what happened			1
in the case of @entity10 , there is video evidence -- and @entity12 needs to release the tape to the public immediately			1
@entity10 was 22 years old when he and his girlfriend went to the @entity12 last month in @entity16 , a suburb of @entity17 , @entity18			1
they planned to pick up the ingredients for s'mores for a family cookout			0
@entity10 had two young children			0
while browsing , he picked up an unpackaged bb gun from one of the store shelves , and continued shopping			2
a man named @entity30 saw him and called 911			0
a black man was " walking around with a gun in the store , " and " pointing it at people , " @entity30 told them			1
a few minutes later , @entity10 was dead -- shot on sight by police			1
his last words ? " it 's not real			0
" the gun was a toy , and it was unloaded			0
( absurdly , if @entity10 had been carrying a loaded assault weapon in a threatening manner , it would have been legal under @entity18 's open carry laws			0
this is exactly why gun safety advocates like myself have so long criticized these laws for creating a culture of fear			0
) was @entity30 more likely to see phantom danger and call the cops because @entity10 was a black man ? were those cops more likely to pull the trigger -- by all accounts , without warning @entity10 -- because @entity10 was black ? in other words , is crawford dead today because he was black in @entity58 ? the answer is clearly : yes			2
but not for the reasons you think -- and that is why it is all the more important that this tape see the light of day			2
our modern conception of racism is as a binary condition			2
you are either racist -- a monster , the epitome of bigotry -- or no racist at all			0
dare i say , black and white			1
but that is not what science tells us			0
flash faces up on a screen and ask people to identify which ones are dangerous , and people will subtly pick those with darker skin			2
ask them to play a video game where they shoot only bad guys wielding weapons , and they are marginally more likely to " make a mistake " when the unarmed figure is black			1
scientists call it " implicit bias			1
" and the shocking thing ? it appears not just in those who are openly bigoted , but even among believers in racial equality ( including many black people ourselves )			1
in other words , when it comes to racial attitudes , science has proven both right and left wrong			0
racism is not a thing of the past ; bias still lurks in our minds , despite ourselves			1
so conservatives are wrong when they insist that race is a non-issue and that everyone should " move on			0
" they should really stop accusing anyone who raises the issue of " just playing the race card			0
" science is not on their side			0
on the other hand , progressives need to do a better job of acknowledging that @entity124 's message of inclusion has had a huge impact -- at least at a conscious level			0
we have moved from a society that condoned slavery and segregation for centuries , to a society in which only a very small number of people are consciously hostile			2
that said : racism is a lingering virus -- alive in all of us , transmitted by a culture that devalues black faces			1
it is too often lethal to those with dark skin on the wrong end of a gun			0
i can not help but think that it could have been me or my two sons shopping for toys			2
would my @entity152 degree stop a bullet ? would the fact that their father is on tv have been enough to save my children ? the only way to overcome this virus is to face its existence openly and honestly			0
that starts with being unafraid to discover what happened to @entity10			0
and step one in that mission is for @entity12 to bow to the request of the @entity10 family , and the thousands who have signed a @entity169 petition , and release the surveillance tape			1
@entity10 's family says the video demonstrates that their son was never a threat , and that he was gunned down in cold blood			2
even @entity30 , the man who called the police , has changed his story -- saying that @entity10 never pointed a gun at anyone -- after seeing this tape			1
ohio attorney general @entity182 claims releasing the tape to the public would bias the jury			1
but he apparently has no problem showing the tape to @entity30 , a witness for the prosecution , to get his facts straight			2
nor is he apparently concerned about rampant media speculation that @entity10 had a criminal record ( the charges were dropped ) , as if @entity10 somehow deserved to be gunned down			0
@entity12 is the largest employer of black people in the country , and black @entity58 make up a huge portion of their customers			1
the retail giant has an obligation to make sure that we feel safe in their stores			1
if @entity203 will not release the video , @entity12 should			1
recently , a young woman in @entity206 crashed her @entity207 into three cars and assaulted a police officer			1
officers did not fire a single shot			2
@entity10 , @entity213 and so many others are not			0
releasing a tape will not bring @entity216 or any of the others back			1
but if it forces us to confront the lingering realities of racial bias , perhaps some good will come of all this .			0

@entity216 , who was shopping , was shot by a white police officer in @entity12
@entity225 : there is video evidence and @entity12 should release the tape to the public
he says racism is not a thing of the past ; implicit bias lurks in our minds
@entity225 : @entity12 has an obligation to make sure that black people feel safe in its stores
