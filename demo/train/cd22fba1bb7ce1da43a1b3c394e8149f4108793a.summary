-- @entity2 's pursuit of @entity4 midfielder @entity3 appears to be coming to an end after the two clubs agreed a fee for the @entity9 international			1
@entity3 had just one year remaining on his @entity4 contract and @entity2 's offer , believed to be in the region of $ 32 million , has persuaded the @entity14 club to cash in , despite manager @entity16 's reluctance to lose the player he signed from @entity18 in 2008			1
the transfer was thought to have hit a stumbling block last week , resulting in @entity3 appearing for @entity4 in their 2 - 0 home defeat by @entity22 on saturday			2
what now for @entity4 and @entity24 ? however , @entity3 has been left out of @entity4 's squad for the second leg of their @entity28 qualifier against @entity29 , meaning he will not be cup - tied for @entity2 's own @entity28 campaign			1
the move , which is now dependent on @entity3 passing his medical , will see the 24 - year - old become the second player to join @entity2 from @entity4 since the end of last season , following defender @entity37 's switch , while @entity38 and @entity39 have also made the same move over the last two years			1
@entity3 follows captain @entity24 , who completed his transfer to @entity42 last week , out of the @entity44 exit door , leaving @entity16 with a massive influx of money available to him to reinforce his @entity4 squad by the close of the transfer window on august 31			1
and @entity24 used his personal @entity51 account to say : " good luck to my friend @entity3 at his new club			2
one of the best players around			0
" the @entity56 have had a shaky start to the @entity59 season , with just one point and no goals from their opening two matches , leaving @entity16 under more pressure than he has ever faced since becoming @entity4 manager 15 years ago			0
" the summer was difficult because we had @entity24 and @entity3 on permanent transfer negotiations and that is draining in the end , " @entity16 told the official @entity4 website			1
" we lost two great players and that 's sad , but at some stage it has to be over because we want to focus on the future			0
" overall what you do not want is to have players who play and think they go the next morning , that is not ideal			0
you want players who are completely committed to the long term , " he added			0
wenger must also take his depleted squad to @entity84 for wednesday 's crucial match against @entity29 , with the @entity86 holding a slender 1 - 0 advantage from the first leg			0
however , @entity89 have confirmed that @entity16 will be allowed to sit on the bench for the match after @entity4 appealed against a two - match touchline ban for breaking the terms of his one - match suspension during the first leg against @entity29			0
in other transfer news , @entity59 side @entity96 have completed their fourth signing of the transfer window , with 25 - year - old @entity101 winger @entity100 joining from @entity102 on a three - year contract for a fee of $ 3m .			2
