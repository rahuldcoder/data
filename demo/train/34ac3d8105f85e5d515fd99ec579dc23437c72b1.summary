-- " @entity1 " is mostly comprised of @entity3 home movies made by three of president @entity5 's closest aides : @entity6 , @entity7 , and @entity8			1
a lot of people have asked us how we got our hands on their home movies , and whether we had to license them			1
the short answer is that we got the films from the @entity16 ( which is part of the @entity18 ) , and we did n't have to license them because they are in the public domain			1
but how they ended up in the @entity16 , why they are in the public domain , and what happened when we found out there were multiple copies of the whole collection ( of widely varying quality ! ) is an interesting story			1
@entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8 were enthusiastic amateur cinematographers			0
between 1969 and 1973 , they filmed more than 500 reels of @entity3			1
and the @entity34 fueled their enthusiasm by providing them with free film and processing , as well as copies of their films to share with each other			0
@entity8 also told us that they had planned to donate copies to the official presidential records			0
four lessons from @entity5 's failed presidency but the home movies took an unexpected path during the @entity51 investigation , when the @entity52 confiscated the contents of @entity7 's office , including a box of a duplicate set ( copies ) of the home movies			1
thus , the home movies were among the evidence given to the @entity51 special prosecutor			1
( we are speculating , but we 're going to go out a limb here and say they were not of any use at all in that investigation			0
) when @entity5 resigned on august 9 , 1974 , he arranged to have his presidential papers sent to his home in @entity69 , @entity70 , assuming that they were his personal property			1
his assumption was warranted , as all his predecessors had taken possession of their papers after their terms of office			0
attorney general @entity79 agreed that the papers belonged to @entity5 , but also concluded that the government had to respond to subpoenas covering the papers			1
accordingly , @entity5 agreed to deposit his papers with the administrator of @entity86 , with the understanding that some of the papers would eventually be donated to the @entity90			1
under the agreement , @entity5 retained title to his papers and could prohibit their use			2
the inner demons that drove @entity5 @entity95 was concerned that @entity5 would destroy papers relevant to the @entity51 investigation , so it passed the @entity98 of 1974 ( " @entity99 " ) , 44 u.s.c. Â § 2111 ( 1988 )			1
the @entity99 authorized the administrator of @entity86 to take possession of and provide access to @entity5 's presidential papers , including the secret @entity104 tapes			1
regulations issued under the @entity99 allowed interested parties to object to the release of particular documents , and authorized the administrator to return purely personal materials to @entity5			2
@entity5 immediately challenged the constitutionality of the @entity99			2
while the @entity113 ultimately upheld the @entity99 , it did not determine whether @entity5 was entitled to compensation for his papers			2
@entity5 v. @entity115 , 433 @entity90 425 ( 1977 )			2
in 1980 , @entity5 filed an action for just compensation under the @entity118 , which he eventually won , after more than a decade of @entity119 v. @entity90 , 978 f.2d 1269 ( 1992 )			2
in 2000 , the @entity120 agreed to pay the @entity5 estate $ 18 million			2
in response to the litigation over @entity5 's presidential papers , @entity95 passed the @entity125 ( " @entity127 " ) , 44 u.s.c. Â § Â § 2201 - 07 , which took effect on january 20 , 1980			1
the @entity127 provides that @entity129 and @entity130 records are the property of the @entity90 , and establishes procedures for their preservation , including eventual public access			0
as a result of the @entity99 , @entity5 's presidential papers became the property of the @entity90 and were deposited in the @entity18			1
the @entity5 collection included 44 million documents , 3,700 hours of audiotapes , thousands of photographs , and -- getting back around to where we come into this -- the box of @entity3 films that came from @entity7 's office ! under the @entity99 regulations , purely personal material was removed from the home movies and returned to @entity6 , @entity7 and @entity8			1
everything that remained was optically printed to 16mm color negative film for preservation			0
serendipitously , we happened to know the guy ( @entity153 ) who had been contracted to make these preservation prints			0
so , that 's how we heard about the home movies			1
just hearing about them from @entity158 was enough to make us think there was a very special film in there , just waiting for someone to make it			0
we paid for the @entity18 to make standard definition video transfers of the preservation negative , and we began editing " @entity1 " with these			2
they were pretty low resolution , being copies of copies , but we decided we could live with the quality since the content was so astonishing			0
but about a year into our edit , we learned that the @entity6 family had donated another set of copies of the @entity3 films			2
consulting with @entity16 archivist @entity177 , we discovered that this collection contained originals rather than copies			0
the difference in image quality , detail and resolution was stunning ! we had actually already locked picture with the lower - quality telecines , but we gulped hard and decided it was worth it , both in terms of money spent and additional work in post-production , to make a whole new set of scans so that " @entity1 " would look as good as it could possibly be			0
since at the time the @entity16 did not have a budget allocated to apply their standard 16mm inter-negative preservation technique to this collection , and since we desperately wanted to use it in our film , we proposed to pay for archival - quality digital scans			0
we hired @entity202 , inventor of the @entity204 film scanner , to travel to the @entity16 and make the scans			0
he scanned every frame of the entire collection at a resolution much higher than hd video , and delivered them to us as digital files			0
this suited both our needs as filmmakers and the @entity16 's interest in experimenting with an affordable method of digital film preservation			0
of course , it also meant we had to manually replace every frame of our film with the new scans -- a saga unto itself -- but it was worth it !			0

three of @entity5 's aides documented their experiences with home movie cameras
between 1969 and 1973 , they filmed more than 500 reels of @entity3
