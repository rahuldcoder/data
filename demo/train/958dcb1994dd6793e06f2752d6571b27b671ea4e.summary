@entity0 -- when @entity4 rocked the @entity5 earlier this week , uncertainty over tuesday 's election began to creep into the minds of those who have spent months organizing it			1
though polling places up and down the @entity5 were still without power friday , @entity4 's impact is most noticeable in @entity12 , @entity13 and @entity14 , scene of widespread flooding , power outages and hurricane - force winds			1
elections officials from counties across @entity12 -- especially in the hardest hit areas on the coast and around @entity23 -- are concerned that turnout in tuesday 's presidential election will be affected by the damage			1
while many county clerk officials reported lobbies full of people waiting to vote early and take advantage of extended registration windows , polling places across the state have been consolidated -- leading some to worry that confusion could reign tuesday			1
powerless in @entity12 " i think it will affect turnout , " said @entity35 , a board of elections commissioner in @entity37			0
" when people are worried about where they are going to live tomorrow , some people have more important things to think about			0
" in an effort to give people more time to cast an early , the secretary of state 's office in @entity12 directed all county clerk offices to stay open this saturday and sunday			0
in @entity49 , 327 locations have been consolidated to make up for those areas that still do n't have power			1
at each displaced polling place , election organizers hope to have officials directing voters to the correct polling place			1
the hope is that these officials will ease confusion and help smooth the balloting process			1
why @entity61 wo n't be postponed " people are interested , " said @entity62 , superintendent of elections in @entity49			1
" we are moving forward the best we can and giving the voters every opportunity to vote in this election			1
" in @entity69 , out of the 76 original locations , 31 have been consolidated and some have been moved to completely new locations			1
@entity72 , administrator of the @entity73 in @entity69 , said there will be notices posted at closed locations about where voters should go			2
" i do think it will affect the way people are voting , " @entity72 said			0
" i think that everyone has their priorities , and for those who have power and have heat , their priority may be different than those who do n't			0
" " we are trying to make it as easy as we can for folks to vote , " said @entity72			0
" that is our no. 1 goal			0
" many electronic voting machines -- used now by two out of every five counties nationwide , according to the @entity97 -- often require consistent power to work for the long hours they are needed on @entity61 , even though some have battery power			1
poll organizers in @entity12 say that generators and battery - powered poll machines will ensure that power is not an issue at polling places			2
admittedly , says @entity108 , deputy administrator of the @entity109 , the batteries " only last a few hours			0
" if electricity remains out in some areas tuesday , officials may have to scramble to find alternatives , including paper ballots			1
@entity116 the vote : internet systems remain insecure that may be the case in @entity13 , another state rocked by @entity4 , where many houses are either without power or underwater			1
@entity13 uses optical scanners , a process that does n't necessarily need power at each polling station -- although that would be desirable			2
if power were not available , voter 's ballots would be kept in a lock box underneath the optical scanner , and at the end of the day the box would be transported to a ballot office with power			2
the issue : that sort of balloting would noticeably delay the reporting of election results			0
" that is unavoidable , " said @entity144 , spokesperson for the @entity145			0
" the local boards are assessing their poll sites as we speak			0
they are looking to see what the power situation is , whether the site is accessible to the general public and whether the board can move voting machines in and out of the site , " @entity144 said			0
" when they are done with that assessment , they will start making plans for alternate poll sties			0
" the state board 's goal , however , is to minimize the number of poll sites that need to be consolidated and moved			2
although moving some sites is " completely unavoidable , " @entity144 said , " even if it is lacking power and we can still use it , we are going to use every effort to do that			0
" like other officials , @entity144 realizes that voter turnout may be affected by the damage @entity4 has left in its wake			1
" i think it is really difficult to predict that , but obviously there are some people who have had a major disruption in their life , " @entity144 said			0
" @entity183 is not going to be the major priority in their life			0
" in @entity14 , between 90 and 95 polling locations were still without power , according to the secretary of state @entity188			2
that number is an improvement : thursday upward of 100 polling locations were out of power			2
" we still have some polling places that lack electricity , and both power utilities have assured us they are working very hard to restore power to these locations as soon as possible , " @entity188 wrote in a press release			1
" we will be ready to vote next tuesday no matter what , and the preferences would be not to move or consolidate any polling locations unless absolutely necessary			2
" @entity203 and her staff have been working with local , state and federal officials -- including president @entity208 -- to ensure the validity of the voting process			2
one concern expressed by @entity203 is that in an effort to get life back to normal -- and get children back to school -- many local schools have decided to open on november 6 , the same day as the election			0
this was " a change from previous plans to close school for @entity61 so the school facilities could be used as polling precincts , " says a press release from her office			1
even with possible problems at the polls , the likelihood that the election will be moved -- or an extension given for the affected counties -- is slim			2
only @entity232 can change @entity61 , according to an 1845 law			1
if it opts to alter the timetable -- something never previously done -- every state would have to be included			0
the same law also says that if a state " shall fail to make a choice " on @entity61 , then electors to the @entity239 may be appointed on a " subsequent day " as determined by state law			1
how secure is your electronic vote ? @entity1 's @entity245 contributed to this report .			0

officials in three states say voter turner may be affected by @entity4
many voters will have more pressing personal matters to attend to @entity61
some polling stations are being consolidated
*technology* , electricity are among the concerns
