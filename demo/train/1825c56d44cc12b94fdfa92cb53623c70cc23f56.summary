-- it may not be " @entity2 , " but the @entity4 team are facing a @entity6 showdown when their two drivers resume rivalries at this weekend 's @entity9			1
@entity10 has been vilified for ignoring team orders and passing his @entity4 teammate @entity12 in @entity13 to whisk the win from under the @entity16 's nose			1
directly behind the dueling @entity18 , the opposite scenario was playing out as @entity19 reluctantly obeyed team orders not to overtake his @entity21 teammate @entity20 for third place , even though the @entity23 appeared to have a quicker car			1
the controversial issue of team orders in @entity27 has once again tested respect between teammates -- and ahead of sunday 's race @entity10 said he would probably do it again given he felt @entity12 had not supported him in the past -- and raised question marks over the purity of the sport 's racing			1
the willingness to accept team orders often relies on a tacit understanding between the drivers , on their status within the team and how the race will be run			1
former @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity46 driver @entity45 -- who spent six years as @entity49 's deputy at @entity50 -- explained : " in the team meeting before the race you have to talk about various situations			1
" obviously there is an interest in doing the best for the team , " @entity45 told @entity0			2
" all the team wants to see is if one driver has a problem he will not make it difficult for his teammate			0
" if it was agreed before by both drivers that they needed to go lower on revs -- and if that is a code for no overtaking -- then that is what they had agreed			0
" @entity12 was told to turn down his engine revs after taking the lead in @entity13			1
he understood that instruction meant -- as @entity45 suggested -- he would not be passed by his teammate			2
but the fact that @entity10 chose to ignore this instruction and run his own race has left serious , unanswered questions over his respect for @entity12			1
taking the low road " i do n't think there 's the same respect now for other drivers , " @entity82 racing legend @entity81 told @entity0			1
during his @entity27 career between 1951 - 60 , @entity81 would only sign contracts that named him as the team 's number one driver			1
in his era of racing , that meant if there was a problem with his speed machine , he could simply call in his teammate and take over his car			0
there was , however , one exception to @entity81 ' rule when , in 1955 , he signed for @entity21 alongside @entity102 great @entity101			2
the pair shared a mutual respect on and off track , says @entity81 , even though it was " @entity110 " who would capture his third world title at the end of the season			2
" when i was at @entity21 with @entity101 there were no pit orders at all until we had a 30 - second lead over the rest of the field , " @entity81 recalled			2
" when a team had the lead , the number one driver would hold position and not pass him , says @entity81			2
" i respected @entity101 so much that i was just as happy to be number two			0
i was quite happy to sit right behind him			0
it did n't worry me , " he said			0
" we were known as the train because i was only about two yards behind him the whole race ! " it 's all different now though , says @entity81			2
" because ( @entity4 ) had specifically said to ( @entity10 ) let @entity12 have it , that made him a naughty boy but he felt , ' well dammit , why should n't i win ? ' i do n't think he 'll ever repair that damage because he probably thinks ' well , that 's the way i race			1
' " career - defining moments on the other side of the garage , the @entity13 team orders drama may have more emotional , career - defining consequences for @entity12 , whose @entity4 contract expires at the end of the season			1
@entity45 can empathize with @entity12 's position as he considers his perpetual role as @entity4 's " number two " driver			1
the @entity146 was famously forced to cede first place to @entity49 by @entity50 in the controversial @entity148			1
it was the start of a long period of reflection for @entity45			2
" in my case in @entity155 there were eight laps of conversation because they told me that i should do something that was not agreed , " he explained			0
because of what happened in @entity155 , people think there was something that was written in his contract			0
but there was n't , says @entity45			2
" the year before in @entity155 i had let @entity49 by when i was second and he was third and i had that conversation with the team afterwards when i said : ' listen , what would happen if i was first ? ' and they said : ' we would never ask you that if you were first , ' " he explains			2
" and then it was exactly the case the following year in 2002			0
i refused to do it until the penultimate corner because it was not agreed			0
" it was very hard , it was absolutely very , very hard			0
i really tried to give my very best to see if the team would ultimately change the philosophy			0
" it was the reason why the @entity146 quit his @entity50 contract one year early in 2005			0
" i saw that there was no winning scenario , the case was lost , " he said			0
that career - defining moment for @entity45 also led to a decision by the sport 's governing body , the @entity188 , to ban team orders that directly affected the outcome of a race			1
ironically , it was another infamous incident between two @entity50 drivers in 2010 -- when @entity196 was told to surrender the lead to teammate @entity198 -- that led to a ban on team orders being stripped from the rulebook in 2011			1
there was simply no point trying to police something that has always been an intrinsic part of the sport			0
teams before drivers team orders have always existed in @entity27 because , in simple terms , teams also want to be happy -- and that often means making money			1
it is , after all , the teams who finance the drivers ' fun and it is their brand and sponsors who they are protecting			0
when the top teams are spending $ 1m a day it makes business sense to protect that investment by not allowing drivers to race freely if there is a danger that in the heat of the moment both cars could take each other out of the race			0
" the team has always been the most important thing , " said @entity81			2
" i drove for teams like @entity21 and @entity233 and at one time i drove my own car which meant i could do what the hell i liked ! " he said			0
" but once you 're with a company you really have to do what they tell you to			0
it 's a professional business with very big money , which it was n't ( when i drove )			0
drivers are being paid like film stars now			0
" this constant clamor of commercial team interests means the men at the wheel of the world 's fastest cars often have to suppress their racing instincts			0
that is exactly what @entity19 did in @entity13 and exactly what @entity10 chose not to do			1
do @entity27 drivers simply have to accept that when it comes to racing it is the team who ultimately decides how a race is run ? " i do n't think drivers accept that , " says @entity45			1
" there are racetracks when one driver can do better than another and there should be freedom for them to decide that			0
they should be allowed to fight			0
" @entity81 , meanwhile , understands @entity10 's racing instincts			1
" i suppose he was a naughty boy , " @entity81 says , " but he is a racing driver who 's paid to go fast			2
" i 'm glad i raced when i did and not now because the pleasure was so much more then and the racing certainly was purer			0
" few of @entity27 's global television audience of half - a - billion fans would disagree with @entity81			1
who wants to watch races that have been massaged and manipulated by team orders ? but the furore across global media outlets and social media sites following the @entity13 gp also proved @entity27 fans balked at the unsporting flavor of @entity10 's victory --- even if he was doing what a triple world champion is supposed to do , race			1
there appears to be a thin divide between team orders that protect a worthy longtime leader and instructions that see him denied the taste of champagne from the top step of the podium			1
@entity10 , @entity12 and @entity4 will begin to find out how much crossing that line in @entity13 has hurt them when they reunite in @entity6 .			1

team orders in @entity27 are a *hot* topic once again following events in @entity13
