-- @entity1 , a soft - spoken man from @entity2 , @entity3 , is passionate about horror			2
" i 've been into the horror world since i was a kid , " he said , dressed in full zombie regalia at @entity6 this past weekend in @entity7 , @entity8			1
zombies have never been bigger , evidenced -- or perhaps caused in part -- by the top - rated tv series , " @entity13			1
" thousands of rabid zombie fans like @entity1 swarmed the @entity6 , hoping to meet " @entity13 " cast members such as @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 , and executive producer / special effects makeup designer @entity19			1
" i 'm 44 years old , i probably look like i 'm 440 years old now , " said @entity1 who sometimes goes by the name " @entity22			2
" it 's extremely rare for a horror series to gain an audience of this size			1
the only thing that comes close is " @entity28 " at its height			2
so why exactly has " @entity13 " infected the country like a zombie plague ? " i think one of the main things very intriguing about the show is it allows you to vent some of your fears and frustrations and gives you an hour of being able to deal with the zombies in your own life , " said @entity33 resident @entity32 , co-founder of @entity6			1
@entity32 and his neighbor @entity43 traveled to @entity44 to watch the filming of the show			2
that led to a podcast which eventually led to a full - fledged fan convention			2
what separates " @entity13 " from similar shows is that it is character - based , @entity32 said			1
" you 're investing in these characters and these people			1
there 's always the threat that someone could die at any moment			0
" bite into the new season @entity62 who traveled to the convention from @entity64 , @entity65			0
" every episode brings new surprises , " he said			0
" you 're living the experience with them			0
" but would some like to go as far as to actually live it ? " i think in the back of some people 's minds , they want the zombie apocalypse to happen , with just the thrill of it all , " said @entity72 of @entity73			1
" they think that 's what really happened , that @entity84 ( @entity16 ) will really show up on their doorstep , or @entity87			0
" then who better to settle this than the series ' star , @entity87 himself ? " i think it just seems to have captured people 's imaginations , " he told @entity0			1
" i 've fallen in love with this ragtag group of misfits and i think that 's possibly what 's happening			0
people are rooting for the characters that they love every single weekend			1
it 's a real thing for them			0
they 're living through this hell with @entity106 and the survivors			0
" @entity87 made a point to attend @entity6 , to thank the fans in a rare convention appearance			1
" the whole point of this is you get a dialogue with the fans			1
i feel more and more this is n't our show , it 's the fans ' show			2
" fans such as @entity122 , a writer from @entity123 , have certainly made it their own			2
" the basis of the show is : ' who are you gon na be ? ' " she said			0
" when your world falls apart -- whether it 's a zombie apocalypse or life in general -- who are you going to choose to be ? are you going to be a good person and try to do the right thing ? are you going to let your circumstances determine who you 're going to be ? " " @entity13 " will pose more intriguing questions this season , @entity87 said			1
" can we ever come back from the things we 've done and seen ? " he asked			0
" after the brutality of the things we 've perpetrated , can we be the same people we once were ? i think that 's a theme interwoven into everybody 's character arcs this season , no more so than @entity106			0
a lot of his sacrifices and him pulling back from the brutality and the leadership role is because of his son			0
that relationship is certainly one of the most interesting relationships this season			0
" suffice it to say , the fans at @entity6 -- from those covered in zombie makeup to those dressed as @entity161 and everyone in between -- will be among those tuning in for answers			1
a few questions with ' walking dead ' special effects guru @entity19 @entity0 's @entity168 and @entity169 contributed to this report .			0
