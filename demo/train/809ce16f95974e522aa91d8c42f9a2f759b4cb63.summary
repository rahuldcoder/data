the @entity1 military races to the moon to build a base -- to beat the @entity4 to the punch			1
maybe test a nuclear weapon on the surface			2
consider a lunar - based bombing system to target earthbound foes			0
that was the plan in the 1960s , according to declassified national security documents released this week -- some of them stamped as " secret			0
" today those schemes may sound as outlandish and dusty as a relic black - and - white episode of " @entity16			0
" but consider this : currently , a vision of sending humans to @entity20 has begun to form in our collective imagination			0
technological advances are swelling our anticipation of touching that dream in a decade or two			0
and already , the wild idea has sprouted of sending up a crew to @entity20 who would die there			0
now , transport it back 55 years to the @entity30 , when rockets born out of @entity32 had grown into skyscrapers with such enormous power that it was becoming clear they would put a trip to the moon within reach			2
it was only a matter of time before humans would set foot on a celestial body for the very first time			0
but the same rocket technology made for intercontinental ballistic missiles tipped with nuclear warheads , propelling an arms race against the @entity48 's opponent , the @entity49			1
one slip could result in a global nuclear holocaust			2
neither side wanted to get behind , and in 1959 , the @entity49 was already ahead in the space race -- putting the first unmanned spacecraft on the moon , the @entity56			1
protecting the @entity1 way the @entity59 brainchild " @entity60 " was born			1
its proposal to leap beyond the @entity49 opened with the line : " there is a requirement for a manned military outpost on the moon			1
" the paper argued that it was imperative for the @entity1 to develop and protect its potential interest on the @entity72 's natural satellite -- and to do so quickly to protect the @entity1 way of life			0
" to be second to the @entity49 in establishing an outpost on the moon would be disastrous to our nation 's prestige and in turn to our democratic philosophy , " the paper surmised			1
it should have the kind of priority and authority given to the @entity85 , which developed the atomic bomb , the @entity59 said			2
" once established , the lunar base will be operated under the control of a unified space command			2
" the space around the @entity72 and moon would be considered a military theater			1
@entity94 nuclear power plants after a thorough justification of the scientific , political and military need for the base , the proposal -- two documents and more than 400 typewritten pages -- calculated out the details of what could be done on the outpost and what it would take to make it reality			1
it offered graphs and mathematical formulas ; considerations for low gravity and magnetic field , lack of water and air , and ballistic dynamics on the moon 's surface ; and design drawings of spacecraft , lunar bulldozers , modular moon cabins and special space suits			1
it contained photos of the moon with desirable spots for a colony mapped out on them			0
@entity60 would start out with 10 to 20 crew members on a mission to build a somewhat self - sustaining colony capable of producing its own oxygen and water			2
supply ships would bring the rest			0
page after page was dedicated to the future capabilities of the @entity140 rockets that would boost the supplies there			0
with expansion would come lunar nuclear power plants			1
construction of the basic outpost would start in 1964 and be completed five years later			0
the visions were a bit ahead of schedule			0
humans did not land on the moon for the first time until july 1969			0
and in the end , it was n't the military , but @entity156 that sent them there			0
@entity94 nuclear detonation the nuclear arms race was omnipresent in the ' 60s , and @entity60 made room for its possible expansion to the moon			1
it pondered the pros and cons -- scientifically , militarily and psychologically -- of detonating a nuclear device on the moon or nearby			1
and it reflected on the possibility of using nuclear weapons in space			2
technological advances accelerated the @entity30 and the space race through the 1960s , and @entity1 military and intelligence agencies expounded in further papers on how the moon could be used for military purposes or intelligence gathering			1
@entity182 has collected the papers and published them on its @entity184 website			0
the @entity1 agencies also documented their space rivalry with the @entity49 , how @entity1 intelligence picked up @entity49 anti-ballistic missile radar images , when their signals reflected off the moon			1
intelligence officers feverishly studied @entity49 space capabilities and intercepted pictures their spacecraft signaled back to @entity72			1
and in 1967 the @entity195 documented how operatives " borrowed " a @entity198 space capsule , analyzed it and returned it to the @entity49			1
the purpose of a nuclear detonation near or on the moon would be for show , a document said			1
its " foremost intent was to impress the world with the prowess of the @entity1			0
" the security archive said that @entity210 leaders scrapped the idea after deciding that it was too risky			0
in 1967 , the @entity213 adopted the @entity214 banning the use of nuclear weapons from space -- including from the moon			2
out of this world : the best selfies from space @entity221 : after moon , next stop @entity20 @entity224 's spaceport ambitions revealed			2

" @entity60 " proposed a leap beyond the @entity49 in the space race
the @entity59 said a military base on the moon was a " requirement "
military officials considered the detonation of a nuclear device near the moon
the military outpost was to have bulldozers , cabins , nuclear power plants
