what happened in @entity1 , @entity2 , was a tragedy -- not a scandal			1
and no amount of @entity7 witch hunting or wishful thinking will make it otherwise			1
now a new e-mail " reveals " what was already plainly known , that the @entity12 participated in crafting talking points in the aftermath of attacks in @entity2 and around the globe			2
@entity17 claim the @entity12 " politicized " the talking points			2
the irony , of course , is that @entity17 have been desperate to politicize @entity1 from day one			1
fueled by the relentless conservative message machine , it can be hard to have a reasonable discussion about @entity1 , one that relies on facts			1
so let 's try to have that conversation here			2
what exactly are the @entity7 accusations regarding @entity1 ? the main @entity7 critique appears to be that the @entity12 and @entity30 politicized talking points given to @entity33 ambassador @entity32 , who spoke about the attacks on @entity35 five days later			1
@entity17 argue the @entity12 deliberately downplayed the involvement of @entity37 and played up the spontaneous nature of the protests as a reaction to an anti-islam video , to avoid tarnishing president @entity43 's national security record in advance of the 2012 presidential election			2
this , despite the fact that the @entity12 talking points matched those produced by the @entity49			2
republicans also have criticized the @entity43 administration for not responding to the attacks more aggressively when they happened , though a bipartisan @entity54 investigation found that military resources simply were n't in position to help			1
similarly , rep. @entity57 , the @entity7 most aggressively pressing @entity1 accusations , says he has " suspicions " that @entity63 gave " stand down " orders to stop military resources from deploying to @entity1 even though a @entity7 report to the @entity60 says that no such " stand down " order was issued			1
in addition , @entity17 have criticized the @entity43 administration for not doing more to prevent the attacks , such as beefing up consular security			1
yet it was the same @entity17 who initially denied the @entity43 administration 's request for additional embassy security funding			2
what do we believe actually happened that night in @entity1 ? the answer to that question depends on when you 're asking it			1
we know that the killing of four @entity80 on september 11 , 2012 , including @entity80 ambassador @entity81 , was in part the result of pre-coordinated terrorist activity			2
according to an extensive investigation by @entity90 , " the attack does not appear to have been meticulously planned , but neither was it spontaneous or without warning signs			0
" the @entity90 also reports that the attack was " fueled in large part by anger at an @entity80 - made video denigrating @entity94			0
" but in critiquing the @entity43 administration 's comments in 2012 in the moments during and after the @entity1 attack , what would seem more relevant is what the @entity12 and intelligence community reasonably believed was happening			1
after all , at the same time as the unrest in @entity1 , violent outbursts very clearly in reaction to the anti-islam video were going on in @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			1
the night of the @entity1 attacks , @entity109 reported they appeared to be spontaneous protests against the anti-islam film			1
of course we do n't know the classified intelligence , but it would not seem preposterous to believe what was happening in @entity1 was more spontaneous protests rather than pre-planned terrorism			1
and even if affiliates of @entity37 were suspected to be involved , it 's not surprising that the intelligence community would not want to show its hand amid active efforts to track and capture those responsible			0
it was the @entity49 that removed the reference to @entity37 , according to e-mails released to @entity126 by the @entity12			0
here is what @entity32 said , four days later , that in retrospect seems so wildly misleading to conservatives : " our current best assessment based on the information that we have at present is that , in fact , what this began as was a spontaneous , not a premeditated , response to what had transpired in @entity140			0
in @entity140 , as you know , a few hours earlier , there was a violent protest that was undertaken in reaction to this very offensive video that was disseminated			0
" we believe that folks in @entity1 , a small number of people , came to the embassy to — or to the consulate , rather — to replicate the sort of challenge that was posed in @entity140			1
and then , as that unfolded , it seems to have been hijacked , let us say , by some individual clusters of extremists who came with heavier weapons , weapons that , as you know , in the wake of the revolution in @entity2 , are quite common and accessible			0
and it then evolved from there			0
" that seems not only responsibly cautious in the wake of a complicated and still - unfolding national tragedy , but strikingly accurate			0
but the talking points were edited ! for political motivations ! that 's what talking points are , they are the way political figures on both sides of the aisle attempt to tell the facts in the most favorable light			0
that said , the @entity49 gave both parties in @entity180 the same " talking points " it prepared for @entity182			0
and , as noted , there are plausible national security reasons for not wanting to show our entire intelligence hand amid an active investigation			0
this responsible caution stands in direct contrast , for instance , to the @entity192 administration deliberately distorting not only talking points but also actual intelligence reports for political purposes to justify the war in @entity197			2
or consider that just hours after the @entity1 killings , even before the @entity12 had made a statement , @entity7 presidential candidate @entity198 condemned the @entity43 administration 's response			1
those talking points were definitely political			0
the talking points not only seem consistent with events on the ground at the time but with what we now know , per the @entity90 and several congressional reports			0
yet that has n't stopped sen. @entity211 from suggesting that editing talking points amounted to a " cover - up " and rep. @entity214 from saying the @entity12 " misled " the @entity80 public			0
ca n't we have an honest , open investigation and settle this once and for all ? we have			0
so far , @entity219 reports , @entity7 congressional investigations on @entity1 have included " 13 hearings , 25,000 pages of documents and 50 briefings			1
" in a letter written in march 2014 responding to a request for information from a ranking @entity228 in the @entity229 , the @entity224 notes : " the department has devoted thousands of man - hours to responding to numerous and often repetitive congressional requests regarding @entity1 , which includes time devoted to approximately 50 congressional hearings , briefings and interviews which the department has led or participated in			1
the total cost of compliance with @entity1 - related congressional requests sent to the department and other agencies is estimated to be in the millions of dollars			1
" a bipartisan report by the @entity244 determined that " there were no efforts by the @entity12 or any other executive branch entities to ' cover - up ' facts or make alterations for political purposes			0
" the report did say the attack could have been prevented and blamed the @entity30 , military and @entity80 intelligence community for failing to do so			0
what difference does it make ? great question			0
and one taken from a quote by @entity63 , made during her testimony on @entity1 to the @entity262			1
conservatives use the line to suggest that @entity265 is callous toward the loss of life in @entity1			2
no. here 's the full context : sen. @entity271 , @entity272 : " no , again , we were misled that there were supposedly protests and that something sprang out of that -- an assault sprang out of that -- and that was easily ascertained that that was not the fact , and the @entity80 people could have known that within days and they did n't know that			0
" @entity265 : " with all due respect , the fact is we had four dead @entity80			0
was it because of a protest or was it because of guys out for a walk one night who decided that they 'd go kill some @entity80 ? what difference at this point does it make ? it is our job to figure out what happened and do everything we can to prevent it from ever happening again			2
" now , honestly , i will do my best to answer your questions about this , but the fact is that people were trying in real time to get to the best information			0
... but you know , to be clear , it is , from my perspective , less important today looking backward as to why these militants decided they did it than to find them and bring them to justice , and then maybe we 'll figure out what was going on in the meantime			0
" " i take responsibility , " @entity265 said four days after the @entity1 attacks , before @entity32 ever said a word			1
" i do feel responsible , " @entity265 reiterated at the hearings in january 2013			2
when things went wrong in @entity1 , the @entity43 administration took responsibility			1
but when republicans have the facts wrong on @entity1 , they do n't do the responsible thing and drop it			1
they keep pursuing their partisan witch hunt , wasting millions of taxpayer dollars desperate to smear @entity43 and 2016 presidential front - runner @entity265 with anything that will stick			0
the facts on @entity1 simply do not undercut the @entity43 administration , but that wo n't stop republicans from digging for mud .			1

@entity333 : @entity7 has been desperately " politicizing " @entity1 since it happened
@entity333 : in the fog of attacks , administration reported what it believed was happening
@entity224 fed up with repetitive , costly @entity7 requests , 13 hearings , 50 briefings , she says
@entity333 : @entity1 investigations proved @entity7 wrong over and over , yet @entity7 will not drop it
