@entity0 , @entity1 -- in the strongest denunciation to date by a @entity6 law enforcement official , attorney general @entity3 on friday labeled the attack on a @entity9 temple that killed six worshippers " an act of terrorism , an act of hatred , a hate crime			1
" @entity3 spoke at an emotional memorial service for the victims of the attack that emphasized healing and forgiveness instead of retribution for the shooting rampage by an @entity24 veteran who killed himself after being wounded by police gunfire			1
since the september 11 , 2001 terrorist attacks , @entity9 in @entity6 have been targeted by revenge - seekers who apparently have mistaken them for @entity30 , perhaps due to the traditional turbans they wear and their dark skin			1
" in the recent past , too many sikhs have been targeted and victimized simply because of who they are , how they look , and what they believe , " @entity3 said			1
and it will not be tolerated			2
" he called for a national discussion on changing laws to prevent future shooting attacks , as well as " how we might change the hearts of those so filled with hate that the despicable act we mourn today could ever have occurred			1
" @entity3 mentioned no specific laws			1
@entity3 also declared the attack at the @entity9 gurdwara , or house of worship , in a @entity55 suburb to be " an act of terrorism , an act of hatred , a hate crime " that is anathema to the founding principles of our nation and to who we are as an @entity6 people			1
" earlier , @entity1 gov. @entity66 said the @entity9 community lived the words of slain civil rights leader the rev. @entity70 this week by responding with love to the attack			2
wearing an orange head covering in keeping with @entity9 tradition , @entity66 quoted @entity70 's assertion that only love can overcome hate , and said he witnessed that truth in the aftermath of sunday 's attack at a @entity9 temple in a @entity55 suburb			1
" this week , our friends and neighbors in the @entity9 community have shown us the best way to respond is with love , " the @entity84 governor told the hundreds of mourners who filled the @entity87 gymnasium for the service			1
as friday 's service began , three @entity9 musicians in dark turbans sat cross-legged on the ground next to a row of six coffins and large , framed photos of the dead			2
mourners slowly walked past , including @entity9 in their traditional turbans and non-sikhs using scarves and handkerchiefs to cover their heads in keeping with @entity9 custom			2
" you have taken this life			2
this is your will , " a prayer leader said between hymns sung over somber music			0
" we accept your will			0
please give us strength to bear this loss			0
" remembering the victims at one point , a group of seven uniformed police officers joined the line to pay their respects , with some embracing family members of the victims			0
overhead , a large video screen displayed projected photos of the dead and wounded in the attack , including police lt. @entity127 , who remains hospitalized from multiple gunshot wounds after being the first responder to the temple on sunday			1
@entity127 's family released a statement friday thanking police and other emergency responders who rushed to the scene			0
" we will never forget their heroic actions and quick thinking that saved so many lives on that terrible day			0
" the family also thanked medical staff and the @entity9 community for including @entity127 in prayers			0
two @entity9 wounded in the attack remained hospitalized , @entity148 in critical condition and @entity150 upgraded to satisfactory , while another was treated and released earlier this week			1
the family of @entity150 said " we are profoundly touched by the outpouring of support from people across the world			0
" killed were five men -- @entity158 , 65 ; @entity159 , 41 ; @entity160 , 49 ; @entity161 , 39 ; @entity162 , 84 -- and one woman , 41 - year - old @entity164			2
at friday 's memorial service , relatives of the slain shared memories of their loved ones and encouraged the @entity9 community to move past a crime that still remained beyond full comprehension			1
" we must not fight fire with fire			0
we must not fight hate with hate , " said @entity158 's son , @entity175			0
" my father used to say that you ca n't put a fire out by pouring gasoline on it			0
" the attacker , @entity183 , was a 40 - year - old former soldier - turned - front man for a white supremacist rock band			0
he killed himself in the parking lot of the gurdwara after being shot by a police officer , the @entity185 said wednesday			2
investigators say they found no clues to explain why @entity183 went on the killing spree			0
former @entity24 colleagues said he espoused racist views during his military stint in the 1990s that became more pervasive after he left the service			2
siblings ran to warn others of shooting the incident occurred slightly more than two weeks after a shooting at a movie theater in @entity205 , @entity206 , left 12 people dead and 58 wounded			1
civil rights leader @entity208 , who visited the gurdwara on thursday , said more massacres will come unless the @entity6 tightens up its gun laws			1
" it 's easy to be polite to say ' we 're so sorry this happened ' and give the same speech at the next killing a month from now , " @entity208 said , calling for a move from " politeness to a change in policy			0
" @entity208 delivered the closing prayer at friday 's memorial service			1
a @entity2 / @entity223 poll released thursday indicates that the public remains divided on gun laws , with 50 % saying they favor no restrictions or only minor restrictions on firearm ownership and 48 % supporting major restrictions or a complete ban by individuals except police and other authorized personnel			0
those numbers are identical to where they were in 2011 , and the number who support major restrictions or a complete ban has remained in the 48 % - to - 50 % range for more than a decade			0
the @entity2 survey was conducted by @entity223 on tuesday and wednesday , after the attack on the @entity9 temple			1
