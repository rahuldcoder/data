-- february 23 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			1
@entity13 , @entity14 : it is wednesday , february 23rd , and we have a lot of international stories to tell you about today on @entity0			1
we 're starting off in @entity4			1
first up : earthquake in @entity4 @entity24 : the earthquake that jolted the @entity27 country yesterday left one of its biggest cities in ruins			1
@entity31 , located on @entity4 's east coast , was badly shaken during lunch hour			1
it was a 6.3 - magnitude quake , followed by strong aftershocks , and it was heartbreaking , according to @entity4 's prime minister			1
parts of the city , as we said , are in ruins			1
rescuers are streaming in from all over the country and all over the region , rescue being the nation 's top priority at this point			1
80 percent of @entity31 is without power and phone lines are down , making communication challenging for many survivors			1
this quake was actually an aftershock itself , according to the @entity57			2
@entity4 's been rattled by a series of earthquakes since last september			1
this one was the worst , causing what could be @entity4 's darkest day , according to its leader			1
yacht hijacking @entity24 : what started off as an around - the - world boating trip ended in tragedy on tuesday			2
four @entity67 were shot and killed by pirates who hijacked their ship in the @entity70 last week			2
the @entity67 military says 19 pirates were involved in the hijacking			2
four of them were killed			2
the other 15 , captured			2
in these photos , you can see the ship , a 58 - foot yacht called the @entity79 , along with its owners , @entity81 and @entity82			2
the couple , with two friends , changed course during their boating rally			2
they ended up in a part of the @entity70 where a lot of pirate attacks happen			2
@entity91 talked with a security expert to get an idea of how these pirates work			2
here 's part of that conversation			1
( begin video ) @entity98 , @entity99 : just walk someone through how pirates hijack ships and , geographically , what do they do and then where do they end up ? @entity105 , maritime underwater security consultants : ok , well , pirates are predominantly based in the area called @entity108 , which is this area here			2
it 's in the the northeast area of @entity111			1
and realistically , what they 'll do is they 'll base themselves out of the pirate towns using mother ships , but disperse themselves			2
but they 'll move further out into the @entity70 using these mother ships until they can find suitable targets			2
and some groups will obviously go further north , as we can see			2
and some will go further down south and stick to the coast of @entity125 or deep into the @entity70			2
what they 'll do is they 'll move further out , they 'll identify the targets and use these small attack skiffs to try and get on board			2
once they 've got on board and they 've seized control of the vessel and the crew , they 'll take the ships back to the anchorages off the coast of @entity111 , and they 'll sit there and negotiate with the shipping companies to pay a multi-million dollar ransom			2
( @entity145 ) @entity146 @entity147 , @entity14 : see if you can i.d. me ! i 'm a country that borders the @entity151			2
i 'm home to part of the @entity154			2
you 'll find me in northern africa , between @entity158 and @entity159			2
we 're talking about @entity5 , a country the @entity161 characterizes as " an authoritarian state			1
" @entity163 @entity24 : protesters in @entity5 have been speaking out against that authoritarian government for more than a week now , and the government has reportedly responded with force			1
a human rights group says at least 200 people have been killed in violence there			0
the target of the protests is @entity5 's leader , @entity174			1
he 's been in power more for more than forty years , as we told you yesterday			1
protesters are calling on @entity174 to step down			0
but during a speech yesterday , he refused			0
colonel @entity174 actually urged @entity180 to go out and demonstrate for him			0
@entity182 filed this report from one of the areas in @entity5 where @entity174 's government is no longer in control			1
( begin video ) @entity189 , @entity190 : we were able to go to the city of @entity193 in eastern @entity5 , where we saw that , despite what colonel @entity174 is saying , he is not in control of the eastern part of the country			1
there 's no army , no police on the streets			1
the @entity204 protesters have been able to burn down the police station , burn down party headquarters , burn down the intelligence headquarters			0
they are in open revolt			0
some of the protesters telling us they not only want to overthrow the regime of @entity174 , they want to see him killed or put on trial in the international court of the @entity216			0
we also heard from some people that they have a plan to cut the export of oil from eastern @entity5			1
@entity5 is where much of @entity5 's oil comes from			1
and this , they say , they will do unless the massacres , as they describe them , committed by the @entity174 regime are put to an end			0
otherwise , the situation in the heart of the country seems fairly calm			0
gas stations are open and some stores are open			0
although clearly , people are not going about their normal lives			0
one of the big concerns here is that the @entity239 , which has been used against protesters in @entity241 , could be used again in this area to punish the people of eastern @entity5 for trying to overthrow the regime of @entity174			1
i 'm @entity182 , @entity0 , reporting from eastern @entity5			1
( @entity145 ) rallies in @entity6 @entity24 : " @entity247 , no @entity248 , only @entity6			1
" that was the chant from this massive crowd marching through the streets of @entity6 's capital on tuesday			1
@entity247 and @entity248 are two of the main sects of @entity255			0
in the @entity259 nation of @entity6 , the majority of the population is @entity247 , while the rulers are @entity248			1
protesters there have been calling for change in their country 's government			1
and some are saying that those @entity248 rulers need to go			0
the king of @entity6 has met with some of the leaders of the groups that are against him and his government			1
and he 's been taking steps to reform the country			1
@entity275 @entity276 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity279 's social studies class at @entity280 in @entity281 , @entity282 ! which of these animals is a reptile ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity289 , c ) @entity292 or @entity293 ) electric eel ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! a sea turtle was the only reptile we listed			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! creative for a cause @entity24 : most sea turtles , including the loggerhead species , are endangered			1
but a group of 8th grade art students got the chance to meet one in person recently			1
this was part of a class project that started with a field trip and ended with a fundraiser that might help save some of these renowned reptiles			0
take a look at this			0
( begin video ) @entity317 , @entity318 : they 're an intricate part of the chain out there , the wildlife out there			0
we would just hate to lose this species completely			0
they 're part of the balance , for sure			0
without them , then a piece would be missing			0
good morning , guys ! welcome to the @entity334 ! @entity336 sea turtles are endangered			0
unfortunately , a lot of their habitats are getting destroyed along the beaches where they like to make nests			0
@entity343 , 8th grader : it was the first time i ever saw a sea turtle in person			0
when we came there , he was so excited to see us			0
@entity352 , 8th grader : sea turtles are actually not only important , but they are really magnificent to look at the way they are in the water			0
@entity358 , @entity359 art teacher : and what are some of the reasons why they are becoming endangered or why they are endangered ? @entity363 , name one			1
@entity365 , @entity366 : because we keep on destroying their habitat			0
@entity370 , 8th grader : we 're gathering sketches of @entity373 over here , and we 're going to make these little clay models that we are going to sell so that we can raise money to actually adopt some sea turtles			0
@entity378 : i really think it 's going to help make a difference because , not only for us , maybe other schools will say , " this pretty much is a good idea , we probably should do the same			1
" you do n't have to be a certain age to help out sea turtles that are endangered			0
@entity387 , 8th grader : i really did n't think i would be actually doing a project of something that is important to the world			0
@entity391 : i think it 's awesome			1
i mean , having 8th graders take such a stance and an initiative to write letters to @entity397 and to care about these animals , i think it 's absolutely great			1
we need all the help we can get			0
king : i can teach the kids that we are a voice for change , that we can make people aware			0
and i think that 's the purpose of an educator , is to make kids know that			1
@entity391 : they should want them for their children , as well			0
they should want them around for future generations , to come for their great - great - grandchildren			0
( @entity145 ) before we go @entity24 : before we go , it might seem a little early to be talking about a presidential race			0
but do n't tell that to these guys			0
they 're not running for the @entity422			0
they 're campaigning to be one of the racing presidents for @entity427 's @entity426			1
@entity428 , @entity429 , @entity430 : these monumental mascots are certainly at the head of the class when it comes to presidential pedigree			0
and after spending a season rounding the bases ... goodbye @entity24 : ... they 'll be in great shape to make a presidential run			0
they just better make sure they follow the rules , though , ' cause no one will root for a commander in cheat			0
okay , we 're gon na strike up another edition of @entity0 for you tomorrow			0
hope you all have a great day			0
talk to you then .			0
