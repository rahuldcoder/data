-- substance abuse is one of the most pervasive and costly problems in our country			1
over 68 million @entity6 adults have some form of substance use disorder and about 25 million are addicted to one or more substances			1
every year , millions of lives are lost because of it			0
what makes substance abuse hard to combat is the fact that addiction plays such a central role			1
addiction is a nondiscriminating and devastating illness , affecting everyone from celebrities to teachers to soldiers to neighbors			1
despite the prevalence of substance abuse , addiction remains widely misunderstood and misrepresented			1
however , major advances in scientific research have given us a much clearer picture of addiction -- what it is , what is is n't , and what causes it			2
addiction is now known to be a chronic illness that affects the brain , behavior and health of people in progressive and lasting ways			1
more importantly , substance addiction is largely affected by genetic heritability			1
dr. @entity48 : the truth about prescription medication addiction everyone has seen firsthand the friends or loved ones who were not equally affected by the same amount of alcohol , cigarette , marijuana or pills			2
these obvious differences between people have been attributed to " character , " " upbringing " or " personal strength , " but they 're actually the result of genetic heritability combined with environmental factors			0
brain imaging has shown us that drugs and alcohol work powerfully on the dopamine system , the reward - driven learning center , by stimulating pleasure that can not be matched in normal human experience			1
this brain jolt results in a compelling desire in a person to repeat an experience , which then leads to signs of addiction : loss of control over use or the inability to temper use once started			1
if a person has untreated mental illness such as depression or anxiety , this effect can be greater			0
once someone has become addicted to a substance , there are significant changes in brain functioning			1
even after three to six months of sobriety , the brain is susceptible to relapses			0
for these reasons , punishments are rarely effective by themselves in reducing addiction			0
most drug - related prison sentences , for example , result in relapse within months after release			0
despite incarceration , the brain chemistry changes so that cravings do not completely disappear and the right environmental cues can trigger relapse			0
family members of addicts know well the mystifying single - minded focus their loved ones show when they are in the throes of a compulsive cycle			1
drug - seeking behavior becomes more extreme , interfering with work , education and family responsibilities			0
in short , users are no longer themselves , as their decision - making process has been short - circuited			1
so there is no " cure " for addiction			2
but the disease can be managed and recovery is possible			2
the most successful treatments are modeled after treatments for other chronic , noncurable , relapsing diseases such as diabetes , hypertension or asthma			0
treatments for these diseases focus on helping patients comply with medications ( which reduce symptoms ) and adopting new health behaviors			0
behavior therapy can help addicts by identifying their triggers and equipping them with coping skills for dealing with the overwhelming urges to use substance			2
@entity147 - approved medications can break the relapse cycle by helping addicts manage withdrawal symptoms and prevent relapse			2
for those addicted individuals with untreated mental illness , we should persuade them to go into treatment early on , because that may be contributing to their urges to use substance			2
it is critical to remember that addiction is a chronic illness and recovery is a lifelong process			1
the likelihood of sustained recovery is significantly improved after a year of continued abstinence			0
the chances of achieving this milestone are greater with the support of family and friends and a " recovery network of peers " such as @entity175 or other self - help organizations			0
most of the public is unaware that relapse rates for all the substance use disorders are about the same as relapse rates for other chronic illnesses such as hypertension , asthma or diabetes , or that there are approximately 20 million individuals who are in stable , long - term ( a year or more ) recovery			1
these successes are not observable in part because those individuals wish to remain anonymous while they look and act exactly like the rest of us			0
addiction is not hopeless , intractable or untreatable			0
millions of people are in recovery from it			0
