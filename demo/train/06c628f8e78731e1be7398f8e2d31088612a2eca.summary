@entity0 , @entity1 -- in some countries , the written word brings more than just readers to those bold enough to publish			1
local journalists who attach their names to scrutinizing articles in @entity1 are often subject to threats of kidnapping , acid attacks and death -- especially if the writer is a woman			1
that 's the daily reality for @entity1 journalist @entity16 , who says she 's been threatened by extremist groups warning her against publishing articles that cast a critical lens on local customs and national politics			1
" you have to fight everyday , " said the former managing editor of the @entity23 , the country 's largest local provider of independent news			1
" you have to accept the risk , and that 's why we face such challenges			0
" the once fledgling news agency began as a small project in 2003 , and later flourished into a nation - wide network of correspondents with eight bureaus and an average output of three dozen stories per day , according to its website			1
@entity16 began as a journalist there , also having worked as a radio reporter			1
earning her stripes covering the local effects of the @entity47 - led war and her country in transition , she took over as managing editor and began training a corps of budding young journalists			0
many of them were women			0
" everyone needs information , particularly women need to know and have information for their awareness , " she told @entity2			0
" i think one of the ways we can do something is by starting with this profession			0
" but after years of receiving threatening e-mails and phone calls , the prospect of violence became reality when a bomb detonated on the driveway of her home			1
" i was displaced from my home for nine to about 10 months , " forced to leave because her neighbors complained			0
they said " you have to leave your building , " according to @entity16			1
leaving @entity80 in 2009 in an effort to lower her profile , the longtime journalist says she sought to avoid the limelight that had brought extremists to her door			0
" the threats and warnings scared me , " said @entity16 , who at the time was pregnant with her daughter , @entity87			2
but she had also laid the ground - work for what would become her next venture , working alongside her husband to set up a separate news agency called " @entity95 , " meaning " @entity96			1
" today , @entity16 is the agency 's director , overseeing a staff of more than two dozen journalists who cover @entity1 's forbidding terrain in an effort to root out stories in all of its 34 provinces			1
and again , many of her reporters are women			0
" she typifies the double jeopardy under which women journalists in @entity1 are forced to operate , " said @entity107 , @entity108			1
" @entity111 and editing and running a news operation is tough enough there , but doing it as a woman makes it much more of a challenge			0
" even after the ouster of the @entity121 from @entity0 in 2001 , social and cultural restrictions against women in @entity1 have remained heavy - handed			1
despite the adoption of a constitution that greatly expands women 's legal rights , most women are never taught to read			2
about 14 % of @entity1 women are currently literate , according to a statement from the @entity129			1
they " are uneducated and away from education , " said @entity16			2
" women need for women to share their experiences , share their problems and share their challenges of how they suffer			0
" but with internet access restricted and its penetration especially low in rural areas , online news agencies -- like @entity141 -- struggle to deliver information beyond the country 's few metropolitan areas			2
still , there are signs afoot of a quietly developing women 's rights movement			2
last week , a handful of women -- mostly @entity0 residents -- marched in the capital streets , carrying placards in protest of male harassment			0
and yet with @entity155 in the process of a drawn - down , handing over the first seven designated areas to @entity158 , many fear the effects of a resurgent @entity121 or a negotiated settlement that allows militants to come back			0
" this is really a very critical question , " said @entity16			2
" the biggest problem is that there is no guarantee ( for women 's safety )			2
" the veteran journalist said that while she supports negotiations that could lead to peace , she questioned " who will guarantee that the @entity121 ... will agree that women should be a part of the activity and a part of the society to work ? " although the troubles of @entity1 women were there prior to the @entity121 's arrival in the mid- 90s , the hard - line group has traditionally taken a tough stance against them			1
" when the @entity121 first entered @entity0 , the religious police beat men and women in public for not having long enough beards or not wearing the burka properly , " wrote @entity182 author @entity181 in his widely - acclaimed book " @entity121			0
" still , the costs of the near decade - long conflict seems to appeal less and less to the war - weary public of @entity194 and the @entity47 , whose electorates are still reeling from the aftermath of recession			0
last month , nearly three - quarters of @entity47 polled said they support the @entity47 pulling out some or all of its forces out of the country			0
how those factors will affect international resolve to promote local institutions and bring about lasting security in @entity1 is still unclear .			2
