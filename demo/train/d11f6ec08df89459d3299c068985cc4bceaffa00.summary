-- when it comes to the fiscal challenges facing our country , @entity1 always insist on taking the hard road			1
they nearly set off a recession by waiting until just after @entity8 to agree to keep taxes from rising for millions of middle - class families			0
they caused the first credit downgrade in our country 's history by threatening a catastrophic default			2
and now they seem ready -- even eager -- to let painful automatic spending cuts take effect , which would result in the loss of at least a million jobs			0
the good news is there 's an easier path			2
@entity25 calls for short - term fix to imminent spending cuts we can stop this self - inflicted wound to our economy -- and we must -- but we have to act fast			2
there are many common sense ways to reduce our deficit and avert the sequester , which would hit defense and domestic programs with $ 1.2 trillion in indiscriminate cuts over 10 years			1
while we have started discussing some of these ideas at the @entity42 @entity41 retreat this week , here are few of mine : -- we should begin by applying the nearly $ 700 billion in savings from ending the wars in @entity46 and @entity47 toward reducing the deficit and avoiding these automatic cuts			1
-- we should let @entity50 negotiate drug prices , which would save as much as $ 200 billion over 10 years and lower drug costs for seniors			0
-- and we should crack down on tax fraud and corporate tax evasion , which could help save more than $ 100 billion a year			1
these three proposals alone could help us save nearly $ 2 trillion over 10 years			0
they are popular with the public and would help us address our long - term fiscal challenges			0
these savings would build on the almost $ 1.5 trillion in spending cuts that we have already approved since president @entity25 took office , which are helping to reduce our deficits to the lowest level in five years			2
@entity65 @entity1 have offered their alternative to avoiding the sequester , known as " @entity68 " the plan would spare the @entity70 any pain , but it would slash investments that benefit the middle class , seniors , children and the poor -- from child lunches to cancer research to meals on wheels programs			1
that 's not a solution -- it 's a recipe for disaster			1
@entity84 got a wake - up call last week when the gdp figures were released , showing that our economy shrank by 0.1 % in the fourth quarter of 2012			0
a massive dose of austerity is exactly the wrong prescription for our country right now			0
the president was right when he said on tuesday that our economy is heading in the right direction and will continue to do so as long as @entity95 does not inflict more damage			0
our top priority should be strengthening the economy , and that includes preserving critical investments in things such as education , transportation and medical research that create jobs			1
when it comes to reducing our debt , let 's take the easy path			0
that means a balanced approach of new revenues and sensible spending cuts that will keep our economy growing and protect @entity84 families			1
