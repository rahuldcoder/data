-- @entity1 may have been gripped by a snowstorm that swept across the capital on sunday but @entity6 's injury time equalizer for @entity7 against @entity8 breathed new fire into the @entity11 title race			1
@entity13 's side looked to have been heading for a crucial 1 - 0 victory after @entity16 's first - half header edged them in front but after surviving a second half onslaught right up until the 92nd minute @entity18 international @entity6 struck to ensure a 1 - 1 draw			1
@entity6 's last - gasp effort saw @entity8 's lead at the top cut to five points after rivals , neighbors and defending champions @entity25 beat @entity29 2 - 0 on saturday but @entity13 was annoyed @entity30 had n't been awarded a penalty after defender @entity32 seemed to trip him			1
he told @entity33 : " i thought we should have had a throw in down our side of the pitch but that linesman never gave us a thing all day			0
for me it was a poor performance by him			0
why he never saw the penalty kick for @entity30			0
" we remember him well from his time in the @entity46 game when ( @entity48 ) @entity47 was three yards offside and he gave onside			1
i thought he had a shocking game today			0
i 'm disappointed in his performance , i really am			0
" you are 1 - 0 up with a minute to go , we were really comfortable at that stage			1
@entity7 worked their socks off , you 've got to give them credit for that and i suppose you ca n't deny them a point			2
they kept pumping the ball in the box and they got their reward for that			0
" the game had been in doubt after persistent snowfall cloaked the @entity67 pitch in white but once it started @entity8 seized the initiative with the first real chance of the afternoon			2
@entity71 's cross to the far post found @entity74 striker @entity73 lurking and he nodded powerfully in at the near post to register his 17th league goal of the season following his big - money move from @entity79			1
@entity7 almost drew level before halftime but winger @entity83 's powerful shot was well saved by @entity84 , after it had taken a slight deflection off defender @entity86			2
with the snow still teeming down in the second half @entity7 cranked up the pressure , though they were fortunate not to concede a penalty when @entity32 looked to have tripped substitute @entity30 inside the area			2
at the other end @entity92 saved superbly from point blank range as @entity6 charged through the middle of @entity8 's defence while @entity83 again went close with another shot that took a nick off @entity86			1
but just as it looked like @entity8 would hold on to record their 19th victory of the season and restore their eight point lead at the top , @entity6 finished from close range after @entity107 's cutback to ensure a share of the spoils			1
earlier on sunday , @entity46 secured only their second home @entity11 win under interim manager @entity111 after beating @entity112 rivals @entity79 2 - 1 at @entity113			1
after losing to bottom side @entity116 and drawing with newly - promoted @entity117 in their last two home games the pressure was on @entity111 to deliver and his side consolidated third place thanks to goals from @entity124 international @entity122 and @entity125			1
@entity46 went in front after just six minutes as @entity122 controlled and finished precisely past @entity126 from @entity128 's pass , with @entity79 claiming a foul from @entity131 midfielder @entity130 on @entity132 in the build - up			1
ten minutes later @entity79 's goalkeeper was shown a yellow card for upending @entity130 inside the area before @entity125 stepped up to score his eighth league goal of the season , prompting @entity46 's fans to implore owner @entity140 to extend the 34 - year - old 's contract beyond the end of the season			1
@entity145 , preferred to new signing @entity146 , continued his stuttering form by blasting over from inside the area as @entity46 dominated right up until half time			2
but it was a different story after the interval as @entity79 hit back immediately with @entity152 and @entity153 both going close			2
but @entity154 international @entity152 eventually found the net , running onto @entity157 pass before firing past @entity158 just before the hour mark			0
then @entity145 again squandered an opportunity to seal the match , overrunning the ball when clean through on goal			0
he was replaced by @entity146 and the former @entity165 striker was only denied a fourth goal in @entity46 colours due to a brilliant goalline clearance from @entity79 's @entity170 skipper @entity169			1
despite late chances for @entity152 and @entity169 , @entity46 held on to move four points clear of @entity7 in third , while @entity79 remain sixth , seven points off a @entity112 spot			1
@entity79 manager @entity175 vented his frustration with referee @entity177 after the game			2
he told @entity33 : " the referee gave a lot of free - kicks today , and some much less than the @entity132 one			0
it does n't mean we should have conceded the goal but , in the big games , these decisions have big implications			0
" we had a similar start to @entity25 last week , did n't defend too well and gave them too much incentive			0
we did n't play well in the first half , but we were much more dangerous in the second half , with a different attitude			0
" unfortunately we did n't make enough of our corners , free - kicks and the chances we created			0
that 's why we lost the game			0
it 's very damaging for our position in the league and difficult to swallow			0
