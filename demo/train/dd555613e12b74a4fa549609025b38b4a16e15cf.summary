-- electrical stimulation from a spinal cord implant , mimicking the signals the brain would normally transmit to move the body , has allowed a paralyzed patient to stand on his own and walk on a treadmill with assistance , researchers said thursday			1
at a news conference in @entity12 , doctors introduced @entity13 , a 25 - year - old , paralyzed spinal cord injury patient from @entity16			1
he received continual epidermal stimulation to the lower spinal cord , researchers said , enabling the muscle and joint movements that are required to stand and , with assistance , to step			1
" this stimulation causes changes in the brain and changes in the spinal cord , " said dr. v. @entity23 , a professor in the @entity24 and @entity25 and of @entity26 at the @entity27 , @entity28			1
" now we need to know how this has occurred			0
" a therapy already in use in a number of @entity40 hospitals is known as functional electronic stimulation ( @entity42 ) , in which stimulants or electrodes are placed on the skin above the muscles to help chronic spinal cord injury patients move their limbs and , in some cases , walk with assistance			1
in the newly unveiled procedure , however , the electrodes are implanted in the patient 's body			0
but even beyond that , there are distinct differences in the two procedures , the researchers said			0
" in our case it 's a constant signal , " said dr. @entity61 , a professor at the @entity62 at the @entity63			0
" @entity42 tries to bypass the circuitry by stimulating the muscles externally with electrodes			0
we allow the spinal cord to control the muscles on its own			1
" the researchers said in the initial phase of their experiment , @entity13 was able to reach a standing position , supplying the muscular push himself while his spinal cord was being stimulated electrically			2
he could stand independently , bearing full weight , for up to four minutes at a time he also began to move his toes , ankles , knees and hips while being stimulated			0
" this does not represent a cure for spinal cord injury , " @entity23 said , " but it 's something to build on			1
" at today 's press conference , @entity13 , who became paralyzed in his lower extremities following a hit - and - run accident in july 2006 , talked about his experience			2
" i was able to stand independently , the third day we turned it on , " said @entity13			0
i use it two hours a day now , and i hope to someday go back to playing baseball			0
" the project , which is outlined in the latest issue of the medical journal @entity98 , was funded by the @entity99 , which provides money for research on spinal cord injuries .			2

paralyzed patient , 25 , said he is able to stand by himself , walk with assistance
@entity13 received continual epidermal stimulation to the lower spinal cord
researcher : new treatment allows " the spinal cord to control the muscles on its own "
though not a cure , " it 's something to build on , " dr. v. @entity23 says
