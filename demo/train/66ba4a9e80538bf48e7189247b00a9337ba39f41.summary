@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is stuck in an ideological no - man 's land			1
the @entity6 senator is not sufficiently liberal for liberals			0
but nor is he conservative enough for conservatives			2
in an extraordinary gesture on saturday , the @entity9 formally censured @entity3 , who is one of the most respected and powerful elected officials in the state			1
those who adopted the resolution cited a legislative record that they say is insufficiently conservative on issues such as immigration reform and funding @entity18			1
they also seem upset that @entity3 has worked with @entity21 to pass legislation dealing with issues such as campaign finance reform			1
@entity3 has always been a hawk on national defense , and his pro-life credentials are solid			1
but , on other issues , he is a moderate -- at least by @entity6 standards			0
@entity9 rebukes @entity3 for not being conservative enough former sen. @entity30 , who represented @entity6 in the @entity31 for three terms and whose own conservative credentials were rarely called into question by @entity35 , stood by @entity3			1
he told the @entity36 that @entity3 's record was " very conservative , " and he called the resolution " wacky			1
" there 's that word again -- or at least a variation of it			2
do you remember when @entity3 got in a rhetoric shoving match with @entity31 rookie @entity45 of @entity46 ? last year , @entity3 called @entity45 , sen. @entity47 of @entity48 and rep. @entity49 , @entity50 , " wacko birds			1
partly , that 's what this vote in @entity6 is about			2
it 's revenge of the wacko birds			2
during that tussle with the @entity59 faction of the @entity31 , many of the @entity35 faithful -- both in @entity6 and around the country -- made it known that they preferred the confrontational approach on issues such as whether to fund @entity18			0
@entity3 and other senators within the @entity35 establishment such as @entity68 of @entity69 were seen as much too accommodating			1
obviously , there are plenty of republicans with good memories			0
during their tussle , @entity45 tweaked @entity3 by appearing to include him in what the @entity59 party favorite called the @entity31 's " surrender caucus			1
" @entity45 later denied using those words , but audio of @entity45 's appearance on the @entity83 radio show proved otherwise			2
for @entity3 , whose record of military service is well - known , any talk of surrender is tantamount to fighting words			1
but i 've seen @entity3 surrender before -- to right - wing republicans in his home state when his political career seems jeopardized			1
that record is also fairly well - known and not nearly as commendable			2
i first met @entity3 in the late 1990s when i was a reporter and metro columnist for the @entity36			1
i wrote some nice things about him and praised his ability to carve out an average of 60 % of the @entity100 vote in his re-election campaigns			0
by the time @entity3 ran for president the first time , in 2000 , i 'd left the newspaper and returned to graduate school			1
i was a big fan of the " maverick " aboard the " @entity107 " who , according to the marketing , had gotten crossways with stuffy @entity31 colleagues by putting solutions ahead of partisanship and working with @entity21			0
twice during the campaign , i bumped into @entity3 , and he recognized me on sight			1
he would shake my hand enthusiastically			0
in 2008 , when he ran again , i interviewed him and wrote a column laying out the case that he was a better choice for @entity119 than @entity120			0
then came the senator 's radical makeover			0
in 2010 , @entity3 found himself running for re-election against @entity124 , a former congressman turned right - wing radio talk show host			1
with polls showing that @entity3 was vulnerable to being turned out of office , the maverick became the conformist			1
he seemed determined to " out crazy " @entity124 on immigration , supporting the @entity6 immigration law			0
that statute was opposed by 70 % of @entity100 nationwide			0
i harshly criticized @entity3 for being so quick to throw @entity100 under the bus			1
i had hoped that someone who withstood five and a half years of torture in a @entity137 prison camp would have been stronger and able to resist those in his own party who tried to pull him to the nativist fringe -- and , by all appearances , succeeded in getting their way			0
the low point had to have been in june 2011 , when @entity3 -- with no evidence to back it up -- blamed some @entity6 wildfires on illegal immigrants			2
the real culprits turned out to be two campers who had been careless about putting out their campfire , and wound up being fined $ 3.7 million in damages			0
the senator wound up with huevos rancheros on his face			0
now , as @entity3 decides whether to run again for re-election in 2016 -- when he 'll be 80 , and for what would be his sixth term in the @entity31 -- he seems to be drifting back to the middle			2
on immigration , he is signaling that he is ready to support the kind of comprehensive solution that he once championed			0
perhaps in response to that , the crazies on the far right are -- through gestures like this resolution -- pulling again			0
let 's hope that , this time , he is stronger and better able to resist			0
it would be nice to have the maverick back for good			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity172			2

@entity9 censured @entity3 for being insufficiently conservative
@entity172 says @entity3 has been *admirable* when he 's been a maverick
his willingness to *challenge* *orthodoxy* is *refreshing* , @entity172 says
@entity172 : but when @entity3 faced right - wing *challenge*r , he adopted wild stands
