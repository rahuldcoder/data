@entity0 -- the @entity4 government is not fully guarding against the contamination of meat by traces of antibiotics , pesticides or heavy metals , a new report warns			1
the @entity4 @entity12 's inspector general said federal agencies have failed to set limits on many potentially harmful chemical residues , which " has resulted in meat with these substances being distributed in commerce			1
" when it comes to pesticide traces , only one type is tested for , according to the report			0
there are also no set limits for some heavy metals , like copper			1
in 2008 , @entity27 authorities turned away an @entity4 shipment of beef , because it did not meet @entity27 's limits when tested for copper traces			1
but the very same rejected meat could be sold in the @entity4 , since no limit has been set , the analysis says			2
that example shows " the government has fallen down on the job here , " said @entity39 of the consumer advocacy group @entity40			0
" some of the residues that the inspector general cited could be carcinogenic , as they accumulate over a period of time in the body , " he said			2
the study focused on contamination by chemical residues , rather than bacteria			1
while bacteria like @entity52 and @entity53 can cause an illness that is acute but brief , chemical residues are more like to build up over time , and no amount of cooking will destroy them			1
the @entity12 pledged to " swiftly implement the corrective actions " recommended by the inspector , which including testing for more kinds of residue and setting limits on how much of each substance is allowable			0
a department spokesman pointed out that this kind of fix , which is expected to require coordination with the @entity69 and the @entity70 , was one of the main reasons president @entity73 created a @entity74 last year			0
the @entity75 said in a statement , " we fully support the critical role of the federal government in ensuring beef safety			2
" " while the @entity4 beef supply is extraordinarily safe by any nation 's standards , " it added , " the beef industry is constantly looking for ways to improve the systems that ensure the safest product possible for our consumers			2
" the study , first reported by @entity91 , also says that when cattle test positive for residue , it is difficult to track back where it came from because it often passes through several buyers and sellers			0
the @entity98 said that problem " underscores the need to implement comprehensive livestock traceback procedures , " with a national animal identification system			0
@entity1 's @entity103 contributed to this report .			0
