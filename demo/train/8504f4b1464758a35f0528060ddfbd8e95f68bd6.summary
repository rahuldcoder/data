@entity0 -- @entity2 thought he had made the right choice when five years ago he escaped war - torn @entity4 and opened a business in sunny @entity7 , @entity8			1
but he and his countrymen could n't escape conflict for long			0
@entity2 never expected himself - or his store -- to become targets of threats and violence in a metropolitan city known for its tolerance			0
his windows were smashed in and his business looted during an anti-immigration protest			0
" now i am afraid here			0
i can not live this way			0
i 'm afraid for my life , " @entity2 , who is an illegal immigrant awaiting refugee status , told @entity1			0
his fear has been growing for many months because illegal @entity27 immigrants have attracted anger in certain parts of @entity8 -- and @entity2 believes the color of his skin makes him vulnerable -- because many here will assume if you 're black in his @entity7 neighborhood -- you are here illegally			1
many @entity8 are frustrated with the estimated 59,000 illegal @entity27 immigrants in the country and @entity8 's inability to deal with them			1
most of the new arrivals are from @entity4 and @entity41 , and the government says they come illegally through the @entity44 border			2
the police say about 700 @entity27 immigrants enter the country illegally every week			1
illegal @entity27 immigrants are blamed by residents in neighborhoods where there is a large @entity27 population for increasing levels of crime , suffocating the infrastructure and changing the fabric of @entity8			1
many @entity8 who sympathize with the plight of african immigrants say they believe racism plays into all this			1
some @entity8 are asking how a country that founded by @entity60 trying to escape persecution could turn against anyone trying to escape danger in their own lands			2
attorney @entity66 , who works with the immigrant hotline in the south @entity7 neighbourhood of @entity69 , trying to sort out immigrants ' legal problems , says : " there is a very big pressure on the neighborhood , and the structures can not support so many people			2
" he adds that the problem is exacerbated because newcomers come from a different background , speak a different language and have a different approach to life as well as by the fact they are a different race			2
the biggest problem that immigrants and @entity8 face , @entity66 says , is the lack of a proper and enforceable immigration policy			1
he says the @entity4 population should be award asylum and given the necessary papers to work			0
his words echo the call from the @entity95 for @entity4 to be given refugee status due to conditions in their home country			0
but @entity8 has no diplomatic relations with @entity41 , the source of the second largest illegal immigrant group in the country , so repatriating those immigrants is nearly impossible			1
the current @entity8 policy leaves the immigrants in an unsustainable holding pattern , says @entity66 : they are not allowed to legally work but do so anyway , leaves residents frustrated as the number of poor grow in certain neighborhoods , putting pressure on everything from housing to hospitals			1
@entity8 prime minister @entity115 says the immigration problem is being dealt with			1
" the problem of infiltrators must be resolved and we will resolve it , " he said last thursday			2
" we will complete the construction of the security fence in several months and soon will start the process of sending the migrants back to their home countries			0
" anti-immigrant sentiment is particularly strong in @entity69 , partly due to the influx of large numbers of @entity27 immigrants who have moved in there			1
in may an anti-immigration protest numbering several hundred demonstrators boiled over into all - out violence bashing in a few store and car windows owned by @entity27 immigrants			1
( try this fix ) @entity8 protesters chanted slogans such as " infiltrators get out " and " @entity7 : a refugee camp "			2
three members of the right wing @entity140 -- part of the governing coalition - were among the politicians who attended			0
one of them , @entity146 , was quoted as saying that " the @entity41 are like a cancer in society			0
" police arrested 17 @entity8 protesters at the demonstration and charged them with property damage			2
in two separate cases in may , two @entity27 illegal immigrants were arrested and charged with raping teenage @entity8 girls , sparking even more tension between the communities in some parts of the country			1
even mentioning the issue of illegal immigration in the neighborhood where the violence broke out causes crowds of residents to form			1
one was close to tears about the situation , saying that people feared the influx of @entity27 -- and sometimes @entity27 themselves			2
" they come by group , by group , by group and i [ am ] alone , i [ am ] afraid , " said long - time resident @entity175 , who has lived in south @entity7 for 40 - plus years			0
he held up a container of pepper spray that he now keeps with him at all times when he is walking around the neighborhood			0
@entity180 , a community activist who has lived in the neighborhood for 45 years , said through tears that he knows the immigrants are human beings and need help -- but that it 's not up to residents to foot the bill for them			1
" the government must , must in every meaning of the word , starting tomorrow morning , " said @entity180 , " gather them all together , build them a tent city and give them solutions , food , medical , everything they need , give it to them			0
" in the aftermath of the attacks and arrests , visual reminders of the tension are gone but not the sentiment			0
" someone has to take over the law , " @entity180 said			0
the day after the attacks , @entity115 denounced the violence and what many described as provocative language used against the illegal immigrants			1
" i would like to stress that the expressions and acts that we have viewed last night are unacceptable , " the prime minister said			1
@entity2 , who works and lives in @entity69 , says that his @entity8 neighbors continue to make threats and intimidate him even after breaking apart his business			2
he says @entity8 in the neighborhood threatened to kill him and burn his place down			1
with no official refugee status he now wants to close his store and move somewhere where he can live in peace			0
so far he ca n't seem to find that , no matter where he goes .			0
