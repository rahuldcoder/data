@entity0 -- @entity0 's highest court on monday rejected the final appeal of two @entity5 workers to gain permanent residency in @entity0 , dealing a blow to thousands of foreign domestic helpers seeking to make the @entity10 territory their permanent home			1
the @entity12 also rejected a request from the @entity0 government to seek @entity16 's clarification on a previous interpretation of the city 's constitution regarding residency rights , in a case that had implications for the independence of @entity0 's judiciary			1
chief justice @entity25 called any ruling on the request " unnecessary " given the court 's decision on the application			2
tens of thousands of domestic helpers -- mostly from the @entity5 and @entity33 - often spend years , and sometimes decades , working and living in the homes of @entity10 and foreigners living in @entity0			1
while other foreign workers can apply for permanent residency after spending seven consecutive years in the @entity0 , domestic helpers are excluded from the law			1
justice @entity25 wrote in his ruling that foreign domestic helpers are " told from the outset that admission is not for the purposes of settlement			1
" the ruling was greeted with disappointment by campaigners			0
" it 's very unfortunate and it 's sad but in a way it will make us stronger as it highlights the social exclusion that foreign domestic workers face in @entity0 , " said @entity47 , general manager of the @entity48 @entity5 in @entity0			1
" this really just reinforces this situation ... that in terms of advocacy ( for foreign domestic helpers ) we need to do a lot more work			2
" lawyers for @entity65 maid , @entity64 , had argued that immigration rules excluding foreign domestic helpers were unconstitutional and that helpers were entitled to the same treatment as professional expatriates			1
one of the lawyers , @entity71 , said that they were " very disappointed " with the ruling but will continue to fight for the rights of foreign domestic helpers in @entity0			1
" we respect it ( the judgment ) but we think our arguments were stronger in the law and in principle , " he said			0
" we will keep fighting both inside and outside the court for human rights			0
" in 2011 , @entity83 came down in favor of @entity64 , ruling that the provision excluding domestic helpers should be struck down			2
but last year , the @entity87 's slammed the door shut again , stating that the @entity0 legislature " has a free hand in defining , refining , elaborating and adapting " the @entity92 's expression of " ordinarily resident , " within certain limits			0
more than 117,000 maids would have been eligible for permanent residency if the appeal had been upheld			0
a total of about 292,000 foreign domestic workers live in the territory			0
domestic helpers are a financial lifeline to their home countries -- remittances from @entity0 to the @entity5 exceeded $ 420 million in 2012 , according to figures from the @entity5 ' central bank , @entity107			1
studies show domestic helpers contribute billions to the @entity0 economy in terms of childcare and care for the elderly			2
the decision by the @entity116 not to refer the case to @entity16 for its ruling was welcomed by @entity0 's legal community , many of whom had expressed concern that the request to send the issue to @entity10 for its decision undermined the court 's independence			1
" on this issue of referral the court has applied exactly the standards it has applied in the past and it reiterates the independence of @entity0 's judiciary , " @entity126 , a lawyer from @entity127 said			2
the @entity0 government 's request for the court to seek @entity16 's interpretation highlighted the sometimes difficult relationship between @entity0 and @entity10			0
any ruling could have affected the status of children born in the city to mainland @entity10 mothers whose husbands are @entity145 residents			0
under @entity0 's constitution these children are granted the right of abode , and in recent years many @entity10 mothers had been coming to @entity0 to give birth			0
in january , the @entity0 government issued a policy that bans @entity10 mainland women with non-local husbands from booking public hospitals in @entity0 to give birth .			0
