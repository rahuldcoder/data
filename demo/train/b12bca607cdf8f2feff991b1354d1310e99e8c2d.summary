-- @entity1 made news recently by discussing , rather candidly , the possible cause of his throat cancer			1
specifically , he told @entity5 that his disease could be caused by oral sex , which could have exposed him to human papillomavirus			1
@entity1 clarified his comments later			1
but it is inevitable that debate would follow : @entity13 -- and the vaccine that is meant to prevent infection -- are surprisingly controversial			0
human papillomavirus is the main cause of cervical cancer in women			1
such cancer still causes the death of 4,000 women each year in the @entity23			1
it 's estimated that about 15,000 hpv - associated cancers could be prevented each year by the vaccine			1
@entity13 is , unfortunately , often transmitted through sexual activity			0
it 's the cause of genital warts , and it 's an extremely common sexually transmitted infection			1
by the summer of 2012 , more than 46 million doses of the vaccine had been given in the @entity23 -- almost all to girls because of early awareness of @entity13 's link to cervical cancer -- and adverse events from vaccines are closely monitored			1
there is n't even any evidence that the vaccine is dangerous if given to pregnant women , but to be on the safe side , it is still not recommended that pregnant women receive it			1
some are concerned that giving the vaccine makes girls more likely to have sex			2
but in 2012 , researchers reported on a group of almost 1,400 girls , 493 of whom had received the vaccine			0
they followed them for three years after ages 11 - 12 to see if girls who received the vaccine differed in sexual outcomes from those who did not			0
girls who got the vaccine were not more likely to be infected with a sexually transmitted infection , get pregnant or seek contraceptive counseling			1
as of 2011 , only about a third of girls ages 13 to 17 had been vaccinated against @entity13			0
that was not much more of an improvement over the 32 % who had been covered in 2010			0
we need to do a much better job of protecting women from @entity13 , and cervical cancer associated with @entity13			2
but what about other forms of cancer ? anal sex can also result in the transmission of sexually transmitted infections such as @entity13			1
data from the @entity78 cancer registry shows that the incidence of rectal cancer has been increasing at a rate of between 2 % and 3 % per year for decades in people younger than 40 without any similar increase in colon cancer			2
it is widely believed that @entity87 , like @entity13 , are partially responsible for this increase			0
moreover , there is growing evidence that the recent increase in cancers of the head and neck are also associated with hpv infection			2
a recent study of more than 1,300 patients with oral cancer found that more than 55 % of them were infected with @entity13			2
it 's a bad virus			0
it 's for this reason , among others , that the @entity104 now recommends boys receive the hpv vaccine as well			1
it seems to cause all kinds of cancer , not just cancer in women			2
of course , we can debate how young kids should be before we vaccinate them			0
today in the @entity23 , it 's recommended that we give the vaccine to girls even as young as 11 and 12			0
to have effective protection , you need to have all three doses before you might be exposed to @entity13			0
since you can catch hpv even the first time you have sex -- including oral sex -- we need to give girls the complete series before that happens			1
research shows that the average age of first intercourse in the @entity23 is 17 for boys and 17Â½ for girls			0
but more than 6 % of kids in the @entity23 have had sex before the age of 13			2
i 'm sure almost everyone reading this thinks that age is too young , and i do n't disagree , but those are the facts			0
it 's important to remember that vaginal intercourse is n't the only type of sex that can result in hpv infection			2
an additional 7 % of girls and 9 % of boys have engaged in oral sex without having vaginal intercourse			1
about half of the almost 19 million new sexually transmitted infections diagnosed each year are in teens and young adults ages 15 to 24			1
should older people get the vaccine ? the vaccine is only effective if you 're not yet infected , and because @entity13 is so prevalent , you really would need to get the vaccine before you have sex			2
that 's why we focus on the young			0
older people have already likely had sex many times and have a high likelihood of already being exposed			0
i ca n't speak to @entity1 ' cancer personally			1
he 's been quite open about his smoking and drinking , both of which are heavily associated with throat cancer , too			1
it would be impossible for me to declare that his sexual activity , and his potential infection with @entity13 , is the true cause of his illness			0
nevertheless , his case sheds light on an important issue			0
@entity13 is a preventable illness			0
we know how to get ahead of it -- by immunizing our children against it			0
to protect them , we need to give the vaccine at an age that is uncomfortable for some , but necessary to prevent initial infection in all kids			1
in the long run , we 're trying to prevent cancer			0
even , perhaps , the cancer that has caused @entity1 so much grief			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity187 .			2

@entity189 : in *interview* , @entity1 says throat cancer may be linked to oral sex
@entity187 : whether or not it was the cause , story points up need for boys also to get hpv vaccine
he says a slew of cancers *affecting* men , women are linked to sexually transmitted hpv
@entity187 : kids have sex younger , and vaccine can help protect them from cancer
