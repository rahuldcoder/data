@entity0 -- @entity2 is a mystery			1
so much so that the presumed leader - in - waiting of the world 's most populous nation could vanish for more than a week without any explanation being given			0
in september this year , @entity2 disappeared			1
it sparked a flurry of rumors : he 'd had a heart attack , suffered a stroke , was injured swimming , and had even gone on strike			0
@entity2 eventually re-appeared and normal transmission was resumed			1
but should we be so surprised ? barely an analyst i 've spoken to can say they really know him , or what type of leader he would be			0
@entity22 , a former @entity1 correspondent and now a senior fellow at the @entity25 's @entity24 , has seen @entity27 's leaders come and go but concedes @entity2 is difficult to read			1
" @entity2 is in many ways an unknown commodity			1
he 's risen to the top of the @entity27 system by being very careful not to disclose what he really thinks , " @entity22 said			1
@entity34 : economy key to @entity27 's transition but this is not an era characterized by leaders such as @entity40 or @entity41 , @entity22 added			1
the @entity27 of the 21st century has no supreme leader			1
the modern @entity43 is run by a small collective , the nine members of @entity46 of which @entity2 is expected to be the next leader			1
this is an opaque system			0
it is a transition worked out behind doors -- nothing is left to chance and little is revealed to the @entity27 people			2
as the @entity55 prepares to elect its next president this week , a very different , more selective " democracy " is taking place in @entity27			2
the 18th @entity59 will come together on november 8 to chart a new course for the country , say farewell to the old leadership and usher in a new generation			2
more than 2,200 delegates from across @entity27 will gather for the @entity59 , and they in turn select the 200 plus members of the party 's @entity68 , who in turn appoint the @entity46 and ultimately the all - powerful @entity46 -- the country 's decision makers			1
but most , if not all , of the outcomes are predetermined			0
the @entity59 itself meets every five years			0
it is designed to assess the country 's progress , and set new directions			0
every ten years it selects the new leadership			0
this year the legacy of the @entity81 years is under the microscope			0
under president @entity81 and his premier , @entity84 , @entity27 's economy has continued to grow , lifting tens of millions of people out of poverty			1
@entity27 is now entrenched as the world 's second biggest economy and closing fast on the @entity55			1
but there are disappointments , and @entity81 's much vaunted " harmonious society " is showing signs of cracking			0
" these ten years without them accomplishing anything but following old customs without innovation can even be described as political backwardness			0
it could be seen as a mark of shame in @entity43 history , " said @entity98 , an analyst from @entity27 's @entity99			2
historian @entity104 is even more devastating in his assessment			0
he believes the very future of the party itself is at risk			2
" i once told someone in the party , ' if your party is to fail one day , when they look for the reason of their failure , this period would be a main part , ' " he said			2
certainly it has been a tumultuous year			0
the veil of secrecy around the party itself has been lifted , with reports of rifts and infighting			0
the purge of party power broker , @entity127 , sparked @entity27 's biggest political scandal in decades			1
@entity127 , once party chief of the massive metropolis of @entity132 , is now in disgrace awaiting trial			0
his wife , @entity135 , is in prison , convicted of murdering a @entity138 business associate			0
the case of human rights campaigner @entity140 made global headlines			0
the blind activist escaped house arrest and took refuge in the @entity146 in @entity0 , before fleeing to @entity55 where he now lives with his family			0
@entity27 is treading many fault lines : a widening gap between rich and poor , rising unrest about everything from pollution to land seizures , and a slowing economy that some say is in need of serious reform			1
to some @entity27 watchers , @entity2 is going to need to be a traitor to his own class if he is to succeed			1
critics say the party and @entity27 's elite have lost touch with the people and are facing a crisis of legitimacy			1
but others warn against looking to @entity2 for radical change -- as first and foremost he is a son of the party			1
" he is part of a consensus to keep the @entity43 as the only ruling party			0
any so - called liberty must only be on the condition of the survival of a one - party dictatorship , " said historian @entity98			0
what happens in @entity27 no longer stays in @entity27			2
in a world still mired in economic crisis , @entity27 is an engine of growth			2
as the @entity27 economy slows , alarm bells sound			1
@entity27 is also rattling nations in its own region			2
territorial disputes with the likes of @entity191 and the @entity192 have made @entity27 's neighbors nervous			1
meanwhile , the @entity55 is pivoting its geo - strategic policy away from the wars in @entity196 and @entity197 to east @entity198 , strengthening key alliances and even boosting its military presence in the region -- much to the consternation of @entity0			0
@entity204 strife and external tensions -- this is the @entity27 that @entity2 stands to inherit			1
@entity206 , a former @entity208 prime minister and once a diplomat in @entity0 , has met @entity2 and says he is a man " you can do business with			2
" yet @entity2 remains largely unknowable , a man who could disappear without explanation .			2

@entity22 : @entity2 is in many ways an unknown commodity
@entity222 is run by a small collective
@entity2 will face slowing economy , *internal* *friction* and regional disputes
