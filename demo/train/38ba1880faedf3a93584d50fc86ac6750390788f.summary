in the neon canyons of @entity2 's @entity1 -- @entity2 's main urban shopping precinct -- the proliferation of one type of shop has cropped up along its bustling streets in recent years			1
slotted in between the malls and luxury brand boutiques , the shops open onto the street and are bathed in a harsh fluorescent light			0
inside , they sell a limited and identical range of dried goods , off - the - shelf pharmaceuticals , dried baby formula -- and very little else			1
" most of our customers are mainland @entity26 , " said one shop employee , who requested anonymity , as he frantically tapped data into the shop 's computer			1
" i do n't know how many we get through here a day -- a lot			0
" for some local @entity30 , the shops represent an assault on the amenity of the city and highlight an economy geared increasingly to the needs of cashed - up @entity26 day - trippers , rather than local people			1
" the truth is that most mainlanders who come are not real tourists , " columnist and tv show host @entity38 wrote recently in an opinion piece for the @entity41			0
" they are grocery shoppers			0
@entity30 have to compete with them not only for daily necessities but also for space on the @entity50 ( mass transit system ) , in restaurants and shopping malls			0
" increasing visitor numbers for @entity2 locals this is not about to change any time soon			1
@entity2 's @entity58 predicted visitor numbers to @entity2 would jump from last year 's 54.5 million to 70 million in three years , the bulk of whom will be mainlanders			1
the figure , he said , is likely to climb to 100 million by 2023			0
last month , about 100 radical @entity30 descended on @entity61 to protest against the growing phenomenon , waving placards describing mainland shoppers as " locusts , " hurling abuse at @entity26 tourists and scuffling with police			1
demonstrators staged a follow - up protest at the nearby @entity72 shopping precinct in @entity73 the following weekend , wheeling suitcases ( viewed as a ubiquitous accessory for mainland @entity26 shoppers ) , causing congestion outside shops by faking " shopping fatigue " and yelling " i have come to buy baby milk powder " in fractured @entity81 at visitors			1
protest backlash the protests , however , also sparked a strong backlash			0
a group calling itself @entity88 of @entity89 organized counter-protests in @entity72 and the @entity2 government has even looked at amending its race hate laws to protect mainland visitors			1
" the government understands that growth in the number of tourists has a certain level of impact on the lives of @entity30			0
but tourism has contributed a lot in creating job opportunities			0
it makes up 4.5 % of our economy , " so @entity58 said			0
nevertheless , some @entity30 have expressed alarm at the strain on its resources from the influx of mainland @entity26			1
even @entity113 's top official on @entity2 affairs this week acknowledged the extent of the problem , telling a closed meeting of of @entity2 delegates at the annual @entity119 in @entity113 that the problem " had been taken note of			2
" laws introduced last march limit the purchase of infant milk formula to just two tins for travelers leaving @entity2			2
a series of mainland food scandals -- most notably in 2008 when milk formula adulterated with melamine caused infant deaths across @entity131 -- has sparked an ongoing run on @entity2 's top brands			1
' zero - birth quota ' the @entity2 government lin 2012 also introduced a " zero - birth quota " policy to curb the number of pregnant mainland women having emergency deliveries in @entity2 in order to gain @entity2 residency and other benefits for their children			1
in 2011 , a record 43,982 mainland mothers gave birth in @entity2 , according to local health officials , placing a massive strain on the city 's hospitals			1
" protests mocking mainland visitors as locusts and protesters mimicking mainlanders by wheeling suitcases in shopping malls are over the top , " @entity38 told @entity151			2
" but although these protests are small , they reflect the genuine feelings of many @entity2 people who do n't join because they do n't want to be seen as anti-mainlanders			2
" i speak fluent cantonese and most people i talk to say they feel overwhelmed			0
so while the mocking protests are not justified , they do send a message shared by most @entity2 people			2
" rising costs in many cases , it is the growing economic strength of @entity131 that has raised tensions			2
@entity30 fear that rising commercial rents and an almost unbroken bull run on residential property prices , fueled in part by mainland @entity26 demand , has priced them out of their own city			1
@entity2 property agent @entity182 , convener of a loose grouping that opposes increased mainland influence in @entity2 , told @entity151 at a small rally at @entity186 in @entity2 's @entity187 that they wanted to strengthen the " one - country , two - systems " policy that underpins the relationship between @entity2 and @entity113			1
" @entity2 is an open society and we welcome everyone , " @entity182 said			0
" the problem is not just housing or education or our hospital and medical system -- it is our whole environment ; it is just so crowded now			0
" @entity202 where i work is the last district in @entity2 before the mainland and we just receive so many people coming down from @entity205 , " he said			2
" even people who do n't care about politics are starting to complain -- they are starting to hate mainland people			0
" catching a train used to take just five minutes but now you need an hour to organize it ; there are just so many people			0
" for those mainland shoppers fortunate enough not to run into the small groups of placard wavers last week , however , @entity2 offered its usual mix of bargains and brashness			2
a @entity221 resident from east @entity222 in mainland @entity131 , who gave his name only as @entity225 , said he 'd encountered no hostility on a day trip to @entity2			1
" @entity2 people have treated us pretty well and the relations between @entity30 and mainlanders are fine , " he told @entity151 .			0
