for decades , @entity1 climate change policy amounted to a hypocrisy associated with bad parenting : " do as i say , not as i do			0
" that began to change monday when president @entity8 's administration announced its boldest step yet to reduce the nation 's biggest source of pollution blamed for global warming -- carbon emission from power plants			1
a proposed new @entity17 rule would reduce such emissions 30 % by 2030 , compared to the levels in 2005			1
the move announced by epa administrator @entity21 was intended to show the world that the @entity1 would walk the climate change talk , and establish @entity8 's environmental legacy as he enters the final third of his presidency			1
" for the sake of our families ' health and our kids ' future , we have a moral obligation to act on climate , " @entity21 said			0
" when we do , we 'll turn risks on climate into business opportunity			0
we 'll spur innovation and investment , and we 'll build a world - leading clean energy economy			1
" @entity8 later made a similar case in a conference call with the @entity44 , noting that power plant pollution contributes to asthma and other diseases suffered by @entity1 kids , especially black and @entity49 youngsters			1
" this beautiful blue ball in space " " this is something that is important for all of us , " he said , urging support for efforts to work together to help protect " this beautiful blue ball in the middle of space there we 're a part of			0
" the announcement , expected for months , prompted immediate protests from the energy industry , republicans and some democrats from coal and oil states who complained the proposed @entity17 rules would harm the economy and raise energy prices			1
" all the major legislative and regulatory proposals to combat global warming kill jobs and disproportionately hurt lower income people and minorities , " the conservative @entity75 argued in a list of " top 10 reasons @entity78 should not impose new global warming laws or regulations			1
" nonsense , @entity8 shot back , noting how similar warnings always greeted major environmental progress in the past , but eventually proved untrue			1
" what we 've seen every time is that these claims are debunked when you actually give workers and business the tools and incentive they need to innovate , " he said , citing previous government moves against air pollution and acid rain			0
carbon pollution that increased dramatically since the industrial revolution of the 19th century corresponds to the warming of the global climate , and scientists predict rising oceans , volatile weather patterns , changing agriculture zones and other impacts in coming decades that will affect everyone on the planet and require an increasing percentage of national budgets to prevent catastrophic results			2
energy industry campaign a multimillion - dollar campaign backed by the energy industry has sought to debunk the science of climate change , but polls show most @entity1 believe the planet is warming			0
almost a third of @entity1 's carbon emissions comes from electricity generation , and the proposed @entity17 rules announced monday would give states a variety of options to meet the goal of an overall 30 % reduction in such pollution by 2030			1
some of the ideas already being used include improving energy efficiency at plants , changing how long they operate each day and increasing alternative energy sources such as wind and solar production			0
@entity17 officials concede some of the dirtiest power plants now operating , such as older coal - fired plants , will end up shuttered as the nation shifts its reliance from traditional fossil fuel sources to cleaner alternatives			1
@entity148 supplied 37 % of @entity1 electricity in 2012 , compared to 30 % from natural gas , 19 % from nuclear power plants , 7 % from hydropower sources such as dams and 5 % from renewable sources such as wind and solar , according to the @entity157			0
by 2030 , just over 30 % of @entity1 electricity will come from coal and about the same amount from natural gas , with wind , solar and other alternative sources providing about 9 % , according to the @entity17 officials who spoke to reporters on monday on the condition of not being identified			1
according to the @entity17 , the proposed new rules would reduce carbon pollution by the same amount as removing two - thirds of all cars and trucks form @entity1 roads			1
it put the cost as high as $ 8.8 billion a year , but noted health gains such as fewer premature deaths and respiratory diseases along with other benefits would be worth tens of billions of dollars to the @entity1 economy			1
higher costs or more opportunity ? while critics contend the @entity17 rules will mean higher electricity costs , @entity8 and members of his administration argued the transformation to a more energy efficient power sector would bring lower electricity bills in the future			1
for @entity8 , another key motivation is to give the @entity1 standing to pressure emerging economies in @entity194 , @entity195 and other countries to also adopt cleaner energy policies			1
until now , @entity1 calls for all players to participate in global climate change agreement went unheeded because developing countries argued @entity1 and other industrialized powers got rich while polluting , and now they should have the same chance to develop			0
at home , enemies of climate change legislation complained any @entity1 steps would be meaningless , putting @entity1 at a disadvantage for policies that would do little on their own to reduce overall global emissions			0
@entity211 spokesman @entity210 told @entity2 on monday that in order to get the kind of global buy - in necessary to achieve the kind of overall cuts in carbon emissions required to make a difference , the @entity1 " has to lead , first of all , and this is an indication that the @entity1 will lead on this very important challenge posed by climate change and global warming			0
" the @entity17 will hold a public comment period and then revise the proposal over the next year			2
under the proposed rule , states would have until june 30 , 2016 , to submit plans for achieving the reduced emissions target			0
states that need more time can submit an initial version by that date and explain the need for more time , with a final version due one or two years later , " as appropriate , " the proposed rule says			0
" this is something we put off " according to the @entity17 , the regulation will " reduce pollutants that contribute to the soot and smog that make people sick by over 25 percent			2
" the agency projects the reductions will avoid 2,700 to 6,600 premature deaths and 140,000 to 150,000 asthma attacks in children			1
" this is something we ca n't put off , and the president deserves huge credit for making this his legacy , " said @entity246 of the @entity247			0
opponents were equally effusive in their condemnation			0
" the administration has set out to kill coal and its 800,000 jobs , " sen. @entity255 said in the @entity257 weekly address saturday			2
the @entity261 , a business federation , estimated the new regulations will cost the economy $ 50 billion a year			1
@entity8 's move could affect competitive @entity266 races in coal industry states such as @entity268 , @entity269 and @entity270 at a time when @entity272 are trying to keep control of the upper chamber			2
" by imposing these draconian new rules on the nation 's coal industry , president @entity8 and every other liberal lawmaker in @entity78 who quietly supports them is also picking regional favorites , helping their political supporters in states like @entity286 and @entity287 while inflicting acute pain on states like @entity268 , " said @entity275 leader @entity275 , who is facing a re-election battle in november in the @entity268			1
" the impact on individuals and families and entire regions of the country will be catastrophic , as a proud domestic industry is decimated â € ” and many of its jobs shipped overseas			0
" some democrats doubting some @entity272 from fossil fuel states who face tough re-election battles , such as sens. @entity301 in @entity302 and @entity303 in @entity304 , expressed concern monday with the proposed @entity17 rule but stopped short of condemning outright the need to address rising carbon emissions			2
@entity272 sen. @entity309 of @entity310 , who also has a tough re-election challenge from former @entity313 sen. @entity312 , took her own regional approach to the matter , saying the @entity17 rule was needed to balance regulation of power plants			2
" for too long , the @entity321 has been allowed to lag behind @entity310 and other @entity323 states in addressing carbon pollution , " she said , referring to acid rain regulations that affected her region			0
" the draft @entity17 rules will get @entity321 power plants to do what power plants in @entity323 have already done and will decrease the air pollution that moves from the @entity321 to our states			2
" @entity309 added that " we are already seeing the impact of climate change in @entity310 , threatening many of our traditional industries and the health of our children , " saying she would " carefully review the proposed @entity17 rules to ensure they protect @entity310 , but the time for national action is long overdue			2
" @entity343 : take the path to clean energy opinion : cleaner air will help save planet @entity2 's @entity349 , @entity350 , and @entity351 contributed to this report .			0

president @entity8 says critics always *wrong* with dire predictions
administration officials say it will build jobs , benefit the economy
the regulations will prevent up to 6,600 premature deaths , the @entity17 says
plan will cost up to $ 8.8 billion annually but bring benefits worth $ 55 - $ *93* billion , @entity17 says
