@entity0 suffered its second high - profile embarrassment in six months when it was forced to cancel trades in @entity3 after a trading glitch caused the company 's shares to soar nearly 30 per cent			1
the error marred the completion of the recently split group 's switch to @entity0 and evoked memories of the exchange 's botched handling of the @entity15 flotation in may			1
the trading error and cancellation came a day after @entity19 regulators met to address concerns about the impact of technology on market stability			1
weeks after @entity0 's bungled handling of @entity15 's public offering , a software error at @entity27 caused the electronic trading and brokerage company to suffer a $ 440m loss , sending it to the brink of bankruptcy			1
@entity3 shares , which together with @entity37 , the global snacks group created in the split , switched their listing from the @entity39 to @entity0 , surged as much as 28.9 per cent to $ 58.54 in the first minute of trading seconds after @entity41 , the company 's former chief executive , rang the market 's opening bell			1
within an hour , @entity0 and other stock exchanges conducted a review of the processed trades , deemed them erroneous and cancelled them			0
initial investigations suggested the erroneous trades were the result of a faulty trading algorithm			0
the episode highlights concerns among some market participants that the speed of transactions , driven by technical advances , often leaves the market susceptible to potentially hazardous errors			0
" that 's the problem with our market structure today , there is no room for any type of error , " said @entity62 , co-head of @entity63 and a critic of high - frequency trading			1
" these electronic trading systems and the @entity75 market - makers are set up to inflict the maximum amount of pain on any mistake			0
" @entity3 's shares quickly retreated after the trades were cancelled and closed down 1.2 per cent to $ 44.87			2

" @entity0 's systems performed normally and the industry 's process for handling these issues worked as intended			0
" the exchange declined to name the company where the trading error originated			0
@entity102 , chief executive of @entity103 , a market data company , said the problem appeared to be an algorithm that was trying to buy 30,000 shares in @entity3 but did not want to skew the market by buying them all at once			2
" the trades were spread out by milliseconds and look to have executed at 11 different trading venues , " mr @entity102 said			0
ms @entity41 decided last year to separate @entity3 into a @entity19 grocery business , which would maintain its name , and an international snacks business to be called @entity37 , which she would lead			0
@entity3 said last june that both companies would be listed on the @entity0 , dealing a blow to the @entity39			2
the move surprised some after glitches occurred during the opening minutes of trading for @entity15 but @entity3 said it was confident in @entity0 and that it had been drawn to the exchange 's liquidity and cost effectiveness .			1
