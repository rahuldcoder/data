-- how is it possible that @entity2 has not managed to come together and build an effective response to gun massacres ? how can that be ? if another country had sent a killer who massacred people at random in the streets of an @entity2 city , @entity5 would have rushed to emergency session and the public would have thrown its support behind forceful action			1
politicians , news media , community groups , everyone would be working in solidarity to combat the evil facing the nation			2
just imagine if it happened again and again			2
in @entity24 , @entity25 , a mass killing has shaken the nation			1
but every time we hear of another gunman 's rampage , @entity2 go straight into their comfort zone			1
for a few days , advocates of gun rights stiffen their spines and vehemently defend their turf			1
on the other side , gun control advocates brandish their arguments while relatives of the latest victims cry out in pain and despair			1
the discussion combusts and burns itself off with the usual ingredients : is the problem too many guns ? is it mental health ? is it guns in the hands of the wrong people ? yes , yes , yes to all of the above			2
each killing spree triggers other discussions			2
is it hatred for women , a breakdown of societal norms , too many video games , violence in movies ? by all means we should study , debate and analyze the many factors that contribute to violence			2
but first , it 's time to take the urgent action needed to stanch the bleeding , to at least slow the hemorrhage			1
opinion : i 'm a gun owner and i want gun control how can a country become accustomed to the idea that children may go to school one morning and never come home ? it happens over and over and over again			1
how can it become routine that anyone , anywhere , for no reason at all , can get killed by a mentally disturbed person ? at times , the entire country 's response to the endless stream of killings resembles the embarrassing stagnation of politicians in @entity91			1
each side self - righteously preaches , firing up its own supporters , and nothing changes			1
politicians , by the way , have become useless in tackling the crisis			2
talking about guns is too risky			2
in 1999 , when two killers massacred more than a dozen , mostly teenagers , at @entity102 , the entire world was in shock			2
since then , the shootings have kept coming			0
at @entity106 , 32 people were killed			0
in @entity108 , @entity109 , 12 people were shot dead , 70 were injured			0
at @entity112 , 20 children and six staff members were killed			0
at a parking lot in @entity115 , @entity116 , a congresswoman was shot in the head			0
luckily , she survived , but others nearby were killed			0
there are two common denominators : guns and mental illness			0
can @entity2 set aside their differences and try to work out an agreement that will address this crisis ? can the two sides recognize the sorrow and pain that are spreading as they shout past one another ? gun enthusiasts do n't support mass murder			1
that 's the fundamental common ground			1
can we have a moment to set aside strategic long - term political objectives -- just a brief interlude -- and work together to try to prevent more people with mental illness from arming themselves and killing the innocent ? here 's what i suggest			1
might the @entity143 , with all its political power , announce it is willing to speak with mental health specialists , law enforcement officials and gun control advocates to focus sharply on just this issue ? hold a summit , form a high - level committee , take the first step on the road to a solution			1
consider a few recent killing sprees			0
the @entity112 killer had serious mental health issues			0
the man who shot rep. @entity159 had dropped out of school after his college required a mental health evaluation			0
the @entity164 killer had been investigated by the university for stalking and had been declared mentally ill by a @entity106 special justice			0
the @entity24 shooter also had a history of mental illness			1
like many others mass shooters , he had given clear signs that he was extremely dangerous , planning to kill			0
he had had several encounters with police			0
his family had alerted the police to the danger			0
still , like all the other mass shooters before him , he was able to build an arsenal as he planned his rampage			0
the threshold for taking someone against their will for psychiatric evaluation needs to be lowered			0
police need better mental health training			0
it must become easier to intervene when there are risks			0
importantly , people who have mental illnesses that put them at risk of violence should be blocked from owning weapons			2
does anyone , even the most avid hunter , the most passionate gun enthusiast , think mentally ill people should be allowed to own semi-automatic weapons , or any weapons at all , for that matter ? opinion : let teens talk about mental illness beyond the area of mental health , there is much to be debated about whether a free society requires that its citizens be allowed to arm themselves so thoroughly , and whether an armed population makes for more or less crime			2
the @entity2 can learn from the experience of other countries where people maintain wide - ranging rights to carry weapons , but have taken measures that effectively brought an end to gun massacres			1
everyone is at risk now , people in every zip code , in every income level , of every race			1
a loved one could die in a random shooting out on the street or in a temple or a movie theater ; in a country club , or on a college campus			1
no one can honestly deny that it is a real crisis			0
@entity2 can take steps to start fixing this problem			1
gun lovers and gun control advocates can come together and craft a solution			1
show @entity91 that it can be done			0
show the world that @entity2 has the power to solve an urgent problem .			1

@entity245 : gun rampages , like the one in @entity24 , have become routine
@entity248 : why ca n't @entity2 come up with an effective response to gun massacres ?
she says the @entity143 should hold a high - level summit with gun control advocates
@entity248 : everyone 's at risk now , anyone can die from a random shooting in the @entity2
