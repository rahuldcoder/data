-- @entity1 , the @entity2 girl who underwent a lung transplant last week following a court battle , is out of a coma and responsive			2
the 10 - year - old woke up friday night , said @entity7 , a family spokeswoman			1
although she remains on a ventilator and is unable to talk , she is nodding and shaking her head in response to questions , @entity8 said			1
prior to her surgery , @entity14 , who suffers from cystic fibrosis , was put in a medically induced coma to allow her body needed rest prior to the transplant surgery			1
her family fought to allow children to compete with adults waiting for lungs based on sickness in a case that has sparked a public debate			2
she received new lungs on june 12 after a six - hour surgery that included resizing lungs from a grownup			1
" we expect it will be a long road , but we 're not going for easy , we 're going for possible			2
and an organ donor has made this possible for her , " the family said in a statement			2
the parents ' push for an organ transplant policy change has thrust the issue of who gets donated organs into the national spotlight			2
this month , the @entity46 and @entity48 's executive committee approved a one - year change that makes children younger than 12 eligible for priority on adult lung transplant lists			1
@entity14 received lungs donated by an adult , according to @entity8 , meaning the lungs needed to be modified			1
she has been in and out of hospitals her entire life , but her condition worsened this year			2
her lungs had been deteriorating rapidly over the past few months -- much faster than anyone in her family expected			0
in may , doctors told her mother , @entity62 , that @entity14 had less than five weeks to live			1
with just weeks left , @entity14 fights the system for life - saving pair of lungs " we knew at some point , she would need new lungs , " her father , @entity66 , said in may			1
" we had hoped it would be much further down the road , but the disease has progressed			0
" at that time , @entity14 had been on the waiting list for new lungs for 18 months			1
the @entity76 were under the impression that the transplant would happen any day , since she was the first candidate on the priority list for children in her region			0
but children 's organs rarely become available			0
in 2012 , there were just 10 transplants in @entity14 's age group , according to the @entity87			1
comparatively , there were more than 1,700 adult transplants in the same year			2
only people 12 years and older qualified for the adult lungs			0
doctors previously have said they believe modified adult lungs could save her life			0
her family contacted a lawyer this month , who petitioned @entity101 secretary @entity100 to change the rules that keep children under 12 from being prioritized for donated lungs			0
@entity100 had previously told the family that she did n't have the authority to intervene in a particular case , but she did also call for a policy review			0
any change in the policy , though , could take up to two years -- time the @entity76 did n't have			0
in a letter before the surgery , the family argued the rule was making it all but impossible for @entity14 to receive a lung ; every adult on the list would have to turn down the lung to let the little girl have it			1
" the under 12 rule is unfair , arbitrary and capricious , inconsistent with the statute and regulations , and stands in the way of @entity14 potentially receiving a set of lungs that she needs to live , " wrote @entity122 , the family 's lawyer			1
dying girl 's plight sparks fight over organ transplants " we have never , ever asked that @entity14 get special attention or be placed in front of anyone more severe than her , " her father said at the time			1
" so if there ... is another adult who is more severe , who has a higher lung allocation score , they will still get their lungs first			0
" several factors determine someone 's place in line on the adult list : distance from donor to potential recipient , a lung allocation score determined by a patient 's diagnosis and test results , and a patient 's blood type			0
several lawmakers also got involved urging @entity100 to act			0
rep. @entity160 and sen. @entity161 , both from @entity163 , co-signed a letter sent to @entity101			0
it read : " you have the ability and authority to intervene to allow for @entity14 and other children under the age of 12 to become eligible for adult organs			1
" on june 5 , the @entity1 family asked a federal judge to issue a restraining order to block @entity100 from having the agency that oversees transplants apply the policy			0
the judge granted the injunction and ordered @entity100 to direct the @entity87 to waive the rule in @entity14 's case			1
@entity100 sent a letter to the @entity87 the following day directing it to comply with the judge 's order			0
