-- next time a friend of yours calls up asking for their spare key , they may be looking for a @entity7 password			2
on thursday , @entity7 began testing a tool called @entity9			0
it lets a user specify between three and five pals on the social network ( no more , no less ) who can be counted on to pass along a special code if the user somehow gets locked out of his or her account			0
it 's essentially another way to regain access to your @entity7 page if you forget your password			0
the option will show up on the " account settings " page for some of @entity7 's 800 million users during the next few weeks , the company said in a statement			1
when someone who has enabled the feature is unable to login using the normal means , they can click " forgot my password " and request that keys be sent to their specified friends via @entity7 message			1
the user must then retrieve all the codes , or keys , and enter them into fields on @entity7 's password - recovery page to log back in , a @entity7 spokeswoman said in an e-mail			1
this makes the process sort of like a scavenger hunt , although one with a less - than - exciting reward			0
the @entity9 feature will not be mandatory			0
it joins other account - recovery features such as the ubiquitous " forgot my password " and security questions , as well as less conventional methods , like identifying friends ' faces in pictures or recovering passwords via text message			1
@entity7 also began testing another security feature on thursday for setting different passwords on each site that takes @entity7 credentials .			2

@entity7 has begun testing new security features
one allows users to specify *people* who can help with account *emergencies*
users must collect three to five keys from friends in order to log in
