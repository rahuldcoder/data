-- @entity1 and @entity2 may have had troubles attracting usage , but the new ability to place calls from @entity7 appears to have caught on quickly			1
" over 1,000,000 calls placed from @entity7 in just 24 hours ! " @entity9 tweeted thursday , evidently pleased with the number			1
for comparison , there are somewhat more than 300 million people in the @entity14			2
if the average person makes 10 calls per day -- research in 2008 put the number at 208 calls per month -- that means about one out of every 3,000 calls in the @entity14 went through the service on its first day			1
the service lets @entity7 users make free calls to @entity14 and @entity26 and inexpensive calls to phones in other countries			1
it uses @entity7 as an interface and optionally can integrate with @entity32 to receive calls as well			1
to be sure , a lot of calls are placed daily in the @entity14 , where the new @entity7 feature was activated initially			1
but the figure indicates that a sizable number of the millions of @entity7 users at least gave it a whirl even if they did n't decide it was time to stop paying for their other phones			1
i had two successes with the service the day it launched , both unplanned			1
first , somebody called my mobile phone and my computer " rang " as well			0
i had the pleasure of conducting an interview via headphones and my computer 's microphone rather than trying to squeeze my mobile phone between my shoulder and ear for an hour			0
i 've done plenty of interviews over @entity61 , but this time the call came in from the phone system without my having to get somebody to sign up for @entity61 or for me to pay for a @entity61 phone number			0
second , i came back to my desk to see a missed call announced on my @entity7 screen			2
i clicked the phone number to call back and had a quick chat through my computer			0
nothing fancy , but no mobile phone minutes were consumed in this process , and i did n't have to tell anybody anything except my @entity32 phone number			0
given the vast number of phone calls made daily , i 'm reluctant to draw any grand conclusions			2
but the fact is that i used the service twice yesterday without actively seeking to do so ( granted , i already signed up for @entity32 and installed the required chat plug - in )			2
that indicates to me that it 's a matter those in the voice over @entity87 ( @entity88 ) realm or more traditional telephony will need to take seriously			0
