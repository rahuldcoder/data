-- it may not be fair , but it 's not illegal -- not in @entity2			0
@entity3 , a worker fired for being " irresistible " to her boss , spoke out saturday about a high court decision that said her termination broke no discrimination law			1
" the last couple of days have just been an emotional roller coaster			0
i 'm trying to stay strong			0
it 's tough , " she told @entity0 's @entity12			0
" i do n't think it 's fair			0
i do n't think it 's right			0
" @entity16 spoke one day after the all - male @entity17 ruled on her case			1
the high court sided with a lower court , ruling that @entity16 's termination did not constitute sex discrimination under the @entity24			1
@entity17 : ok to fire ' irresistible ' worker she was not fired because of her gender , the court decided , but because her boss and his wife felt @entity16 was a threat to their marriage			1
@entity16 was hired in 1999 as a dental assistant for @entity33			1
she stayed on at the @entity35 business for more than 10 years			1
" the court got it absolutely right , " said @entity36 , @entity33 's attorney			1
he said that for the @entity17 to have acted otherwise , it would have had to " ignore every other case we could find " with similar facts			2
at first blush , he said , the result might sound bizarre			0
but @entity36 stressed that if all the facts of the case were known , the court 's decision would seem more fair			0
" he and his wife really agonized about it , " @entity36 said about @entity33			2
" he did n't want to terminate her			0
" according to the high court 's decision , @entity33 complained to @entity16 toward the end of her employment that her clothes were tight and " distracting			1
" @entity36 said @entity33 asked her repeatedly to dress differently			0
@entity16 denied that what she wore was out of place , and when asked by @entity0 's @entity12 whether she dressed appropriately at work , she said she wore scrubs			2
at one point , @entity33 told @entity16 that " if she saw his pants bulging , she would know her clothing was too revealing , " the decision read			2
read the court 's decision ( @entity70 ) at another point , in response to an alleged comment @entity16 made about the infrequency of her sex life , @entity33 responded : [ @entity78 ] hat 's like having a @entity79 in the garage and never driving it			1
" @entity16 and @entity33 , both married with children , also exchanged text messages to each other outside of work			2
neither objected to the texting			0
but @entity33 's wife , who was employed at the same dental office , found out about those messages in late 2009 and demanded he fire @entity16			1
in early 2010 , he did just that			0
in the presence of a pastor , @entity33 told @entity16 that she had become a " detriment " to his family and for the sakes of both their families , they should no longer work together			2
@entity33 gave @entity16 one month 's severance			1
in a subsequent conversation between @entity33 and @entity16 's husband , @entity33 said @entity16 had done nothing wrong and that " she was the best dental assistant he ever had , " the decision read			1
@entity16 filed a lawsuit , arguing that @entity33 fired her because of her gender			1
she did not contend that he committed sexual harassment			0
in response , @entity33 argued that @entity16 was fired because of the " nature of their relationship and the perceived threat " to his marriage , not because of her gender			1
in fact , he said , @entity33 only employs women and replaced @entity16 with another female worker			2
a district court sided with @entity33 ; @entity16 appealed			1
framing the issue for the @entity17 , justice @entity123 wrote : " the question we must answer is ... whether an employee who has not engaged in flirtatious conduct may be lawfully terminated simply because the boss views the employee as an irresistible attraction			0
" answering the question , he continued : " the issue before us is not whether a jury could find that dr. @entity33 treated @entity16 badly			2
we are asked to decide only if a genuine fact issue exists as to whether dr. @entity33 engaged in unlawful gender discrimination when he fired @entity16 at the request of his wife			1
for the reasons previously discussed , we believe this conduct did not amount to unlawful discrimination , and therefore we affirm the judgment of the district court			0
