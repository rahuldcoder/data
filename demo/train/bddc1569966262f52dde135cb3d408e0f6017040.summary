@entity0 , @entity1 -- on a clear morning in @entity0 , i 'm standing on top of a wind - swept mountain , taking in the beauty around me			1
in the distance , i can see the snow - capped @entity9 mountains towering over the sprawling , dusty capital of four million people in front of me			2
the ruins of the @entity16 and @entity17 -- destroyed during the civil war in 1992 -- are within mortar firing range from where i 'm standing			0
this was where @entity21 , the militia leader , and other warlords positioned their tanks against the northern alliance firing relentlessly on the city -- a four - year war that would decimate @entity0 , claiming tens of thousands of lives			0
but @entity1 has a long history of war and @entity21 was n't the only fighter to have stumbled across this strategic position			2
protected by low - lying hills , the crater directly beneath me at the base of the mountain , has been used by the @entity38 , the @entity39 , the @entity40 and now the @entity1 to fight their enemies			1
training side by side in the past seven years , it has been transformed into @entity45 where @entity40 and @entity1 work side by side to produce the country 's best soldiers			1
so far , they 've trained 10,500 @entity50 who proudly wear the red beret			0
among them , 1,000 have gone on to become the country 's elite @entity54			1
as the @entity40 prepares to withdraw troops by the end of the year , the focus has turned to training , advising and assisting the @entity1 security forces			1
second lt. @entity61 , 21 , is currently midway though his four - month training to join the @entity54			2
" when i see the @entity54 , i got an idea to be a @entity54 soldier for @entity1 to help our people in our country so that i can bring peace , " he said			1
he is paid a base wage of u.s. $ 400 per month , but if he qualifies for @entity54 , he will receive an extra @entity40 $ 100 - $ 200 a month in his pay packet			1
@entity40 commander of the @entity73 ( @entity74 ) @entity71 is colonel @entity75			2
born and raised in southern @entity77 surfing up and down the @entity78 , the former @entity54 soldier , who has fought in the @entity81 , @entity76 and @entity1 , is now in charge of making this program a success			2
" these guys who 've done the hard fighting have an incredible track record			0
if there is a campaign or battle in this country that has been hard fought , the @entity1 commandos have had their footprint on it , " @entity75 said			1
combat to training while fighting and tactical operations were once carried out by @entity40 soldiers , @entity40 's role in its longest war has now transitioned into training the @entity102 ( @entity103 ) , made of 350,000 army and police			1
@entity75 acknowledges it 's been a long and difficult journey -- one that is far from over			0
but they are having successes and @entity45 is testament to that			0
the ability of the @entity1 @entity54 is outstanding , he said			2
" when the formation decides to go and attack an enemy position , take a hill , they will be successful 10 out of 10 times			0
but we have to remember that the @entity103 are 12 years into building their army , and only seven to eight years into building special operations capability			0
" so the real treasure is their human capital , " he said			0
" and we have to help them so they can build better systems , better people , better leaders and have the formation so that they can move forward in very tough times and fight and win every time			0
" @entity75 's partner in this mission is major - general @entity137 , commander of the @entity138 ( @entity138 )			1
seven years ago , 95 % of the instructors at @entity45 's @entity140 were @entity40 , he said			1
the overwhelming majority now are @entity1			2
' @entity40 's help essential ' while he believes the @entity103 can stand on its own feet , it still needs @entity40 's help for critical air support , heavy weaponry and intelligence gathering			1
and while he refuses to get caught up in the political debate about the damage caused by president @entity153 's refusal to sign the @entity154 that would guarantee an enduring @entity40 presence after the 2014 pull out , he admits the @entity40 - @entity1 partnership is essential			1
" we still need @entity40 's help , " @entity137 said			1
" if we keep building and improving our forces with their help , one day in the future , we will be part of multinational forces to go somewhere else in the world if there is a conflict			0
that is what i hope for			0
" it 's a partnership that certainly politics pending that we want here			0
we have great partners , long standing partners , " he said			0
" this is a strategic partnership that we think will help the @entity1 government sustain , hold on , govern properly and protect it 's borders			1
so with a small investment here , i feel confident we could keep transnational terrorists or others that would want to harm us			0
i think we could keep them pushed back into their caves			0
" as for a war - weary @entity40 that just wants its troops to come home , @entity75 ca n't help but respond as a man who has loved and lost fellow soldiers across this harsh and inhospitable terrain			1
" for the people back home , i would just have them remember what they felt on september 11 , 2001 , " he said			0
" the attacks on the @entity40 emanated out of this country , not from this country , but from international terrorists who found this to be a hospitable place			2

for seven years , @entity40 and @entity1 work together to produce country 's best soldiers
@entity40 's role transitions into training , advising , assisting @entity1 forces as it prepares to withdraw
