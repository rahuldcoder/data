-- the first " cup " was used in hockey in 1874 and the first helmet was used in 1974			0
that means it only took 100 years for men to realize that their brain is also important			0
that joke 's been circulating on the internet for years			0
and while it is funny , it 's also an embarrassing observation about our past carelessness			0
but before we start congratulating ourselves about how " advanced " we are now , we should make note of this one little factoid : for much of the country , high school football practice started last month , and for much of the country , high school classes start next month			1
given where our high schoolers rank globally in reading , math and science , that is essentially putting the cup before the helmet in the 21st century			1
here again are the numbers : 14th out of 34 nations in reading , 17th in science and 25th in math , according to the @entity32			1
again -- 25th in math. no wonder we keep saying we 're no. 1 ; there 's a chance many of us ca n't count much higher than that			0
opinion : after @entity39 landing , is science cool again ? i do n't enjoy writing about how dumb our kids are			1
but the truth is we live locally and are competing for jobs globally			2
@entity46 , our high school students could skate by and still secure a good paying job later			1
that 's simply is n't the case today			0
part of the reason why the unemployment rate is 8.3 % is because many @entity53 do n't have the technical skills necessary to fill some of the 3.5 million jobs that are available			1
and that 's not me shooting from the hip or apologizing for president @entity59 's economic policies			0
@entity60 , a former @entity62 @entity61 governor and president of @entity64 , wrote in a june op - ed for @entity65 that " even with more than 13 million @entity53 unemployed , the manufacturing sector can not find people with the skills to take nearly 600,000 unfilled jobs , according to a study last fall by the @entity72 and @entity73			1
" @entity74 , ceo of @entity75 , a networking website with millions of resumes on its database , recently said that " at least one major driving factor ( for the 3.5 million unfulfilled jobs ) here is ... the pace with which technology and innovation is now accelerating			2
we are outstripping our ability to educate and train the existing work force			0
" the first step @entity74 prescribed to correct this problem : fixing our education system			2
and by fixing , i would start with our dogmatism			2
studies as far back as 1906 have indicated that over summer vacation children forget significant portions of what they learned during the school year , and yet we keep using the same academic calendar that was instituted in the 19th century -- before schools were air - conditioned or teachers certified			2
that would be like us using leeches to cure diseases -- something else we used to do in the 19th century			0
and high school sports starting before high school classes literally screams misplaced priorities			1
many parents as well as students are against year - round school , noting the lessons that can be learned during summer vacation			0
i 'm fine with that rationale , but why ca n't the first sign of fall be classrooms opening instead of team practices ? my son 's first track meet is in less than two weeks away			0
his first day of school is after @entity122			0
something just seems wrong about that , especially in @entity61 where 48 % of the state 's school districts did not make , what the @entity53 @entity127 calls , " adequate yearly progress			1
" even worse , more than 82 % of the state 's students did not meet the @entity133 benchmark for college readiness			1
but hey , who 's ready for some football ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity139 .			1

@entity139 : high schools start sports practices before classes even begin
@entity53 students *lag* behind many other countries in math , science and reading , he says
unemployment high , yet *population* lacks education , skills to fill available jobs , he says
@entity139 : schools should be making academics , readiness for jobs a priority
