@entity0 -- @entity3 prime minister @entity2 blamed the @entity4 thursday for encouraging opposition protests that have broken out since parliamentary elections sunday			1
his accusation followed comments by @entity4 secretary of state @entity9 this week on @entity3 's election in which she called for a " full investigation " of apparent irregularities			1
the @entity4 had " serious concerns about the conduct of the election , " she said , at a meeting of the @entity15 ( @entity16 ) in @entity17 tuesday			2
speaking on state tv , @entity2 said @entity22 had criticized the elections as " neither fair not free -- even before receiving reports from international observers			1
" this had sent a signal to opposition figures , @entity2 said , who " with the support of the @entity31 " then began " active work			1
" he told representatives of his @entity35 movement there was a difference between criticism from within the country and by outside players , and he said @entity3 should defend itself against " foreign interference			0
" demonstrators have been protesting against what they describe as electoral fraud in sunday 's national vote , which kept @entity2 's @entity46 in power but significantly decreased the number of seats it holds in @entity51			1
more than 20,000 people have signed up via @entity53 for a protest in @entity0 called " saturday in @entity55			1
" if it goes ahead as foreseen , it would be one of the largest opposition protests in the @entity3 capital in years			1
rallies are also being planned via @entity53 in more than 90 other @entity3 cities saturday , as well as in @entity63 , @entity64 , @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , @entity69 and @entity70 , @entity71			1
in his remarks , @entity2 said that " if people are acting within law , they should be given a right to express their opinion , " but he said the authorities should take action " by legal means " if they do breach the rules			1
speaking in @entity17 thursday , @entity22 stood by her comments , while recognizing the value the @entity4 places on its relationship with @entity3 and the " real progress " made in a number of areas			1
but , she added : " at the same time , the @entity4 and others have a strong commitment to democracy and human rights , it 's part of who we are , our values , and we expressed concerns we thought were well - founded about the conduct of the elections and we are supportive of the rights of the @entity3 people to realize a better future for themselves			1
" the @entity16 also raised concerns over the conduct of the election in a preliminary report , saying some political parties had been prevented from running and the vote was " slanted in favor of the ruling party			0
" a draft report by the organization 's election - observer mission detailed alleged attempts to stuff ballot boxes , manipulate voter lists and harass election monitors			0
the group , which monitors and promotes democracy and human rights , cited the lack of an independent body running the election or impartial news media			0
there was also " undue interference of state authorities " in the vote , the 56 - nation organization said in a statement			0
@entity133 foreign policy chief @entity132 gave her backing to the @entity16 observers ' findings in a statement wednesday , and she said she expected @entity3 to act on them			0
she also voiced concern about the detention of hundreds of protesters following the election and " reports of police violence against activists , journalists and bystanders			0
" criticism of the electoral process has also come from within @entity3			0
@entity150 , the last @entity151 leader , called wednesday for new parliamentary elections in @entity3 over concerns about vote fraud			1
spokesman @entity155 told @entity156 was " very concerned about how the situation in @entity3 is developing " and that the @entity3 people did not believe their will was reflected in the results			2
but @entity161 , professor emeritus of international relations at the @entity163 , said it was highly unlikely that any notice would be taken of @entity150 's call			0
" they wo n't re-run the election , " she said , suggesting the @entity3 authorities would instead probably run a case - by - case investigation where there have been specific complaints of irregularities			2
@entity3 's election law does have an appeals procedure in such cases , she said			1
while she considers @entity2 's accusation of @entity4 interference to be rhetoric , there is a widespread fear of @entity184 interference in elections			1
this dates back to the so - called " color revolutions " in @entity188 and @entity66 , when @entity3 believed @entity184 non-government organizations and governments were behind opposition protests , she said			2
@entity192 suggested @entity2 will be able to blame failings in the electoral process and @entity46 's relatively poor performance on president @entity196 , who is " damaged goods " since @entity2 announced he would run for president again next year			2
the election outcome may have given @entity2 a " great fright " ahead of the presidential election in march 2012 , she said , but at the same time there is no other credible candidate to challenge him , so the chances of him losing , even without falsification of the results , is very small			0
many democratic nations are governed by parties , like @entity46 , who have won a plurality of the vote , rather than an absolute majority , she added			0
opponents of @entity2 have vowed to continue protesting the parliamentary election results despite the arrests of at least 250 demonstrators tuesday			2
a planned opposition rally in @entity0 failed to materialize wednesday , however , with a heavy security presence in the square where thousands of demonstrators were expected to march , but no visible protesters			2
rights group @entity224 said in a statement wednesday that @entity3 authorities " must halt police mistreatment of election protesters , journalists and detainees " before further planned rallies			0
@entity224 said more than 1,000 people , including journalists , had reportedly been detained following election protests , of whom possibly more than 100 remain in detention			0
it had received numerous reports of mistreatment of detainees and beatings of peaceful protesters by police , the group said , with some denied medical treatment			0
police said 8,000 people had turned out for a separate demonstration in support of @entity2 's @entity46 party			1
as simmering anger over allegations of official corruption and economic stagnation appear to be boiling over , @entity2 has promised to make changes , including reshuffling his @entity256			0
he has said the losses his party suffered in sunday 's elections were inevitable			0
@entity1 's @entity260 in @entity0 , and senior @entity31 producer @entity261 contributed to this report .			2

@entity22 says the @entity4 values its relationship with @entity3 but is committed to democracy
calls for @entity3 's parliamentary elections to be re-run will go *unheeded* , an *analyst* says
@entity2 says secretary @entity22 's words sent a signal to opposition leaders
more than 20,000 people have signed up via @entity53 for a protest in @entity0 this saturday
