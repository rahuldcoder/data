@entity1 prime minister @entity0 called monday for a new law to give police the temporary power to seize a passport in case a @entity1 citizen is suspected of trying to travel to support @entity8			1
@entity0 told lawmakers meeting in the @entity10 on monday there were two gaps in @entity1 's fight against the threat of terror at home			1
the first pertains to suspects traveling abroad , he said			0
" passports are not an automatic right , " he said			0
" we will introduce specific and targeted legislation to fill this gap by providing the police with a temporary power to seize a passport at the border , during which time they will be able to investigate the individual concerned			0
" this power will include appropriate safeguards and oversight arrangements			0
" work to prepare legislation to allow this will begin immediately , @entity0 said			2
as well as stopping would - be jihadists , @entity0 said @entity1 also needed measures to prevent the return of foreign fighters			1
@entity1 authorities estimate that 500 @entity1 have gone to @entity36 and @entity37 to fight with @entity39 groups			1
" it 's abhorrent that people who declare their allegiance elsewhere are able to return to the @entity1 and pose a threat to our national security , " @entity0 told lawmakers			1
" we are clear in principle that what we need is a targeted , discretionary power to allow us to exclude @entity1 nationals from the @entity1			0
we will work up proposals on this basis with our agencies , in line with our international obligations , and discuss the details on a cross-party basis			0
" @entity0 said existing arrangements on aviation security would also be enshrined in law			0
" @entity61 will have to comply with our no - fly list arrangements , give us information on passenger lists and comply with our security screening requirements			0
if they do not do this , their flights will not be able to land in @entity1 , " he said			0
new powers to bolster older restrictions the prime minister said @entity1 's intelligence agencies and police believed that stronger powers were also needed to manage the risk posed by suspected extremists already in the @entity1			2
@entity0 said he would introduce legislation giving @entity1 authorities new powers that would strengthen their ability to track suspected supporters of @entity8 , by providing " enhanced use of exclusion zones " or " relocation powers			1
" the powers would be in addition to existing terrorism prevention and investigation measures , or @entity88 , which allow restrictions on terror suspects , including overnight residence at a specified address , gps tagging , reporting requirements , and restrictions on travel , movement , association , communication , finances , work and study			0
threat level raised the @entity1 government raised its terror threat level friday from " substantial " to " severe " -- the fourth of five levels in response to events in @entity37 and @entity36 , where @entity8 militants have seized a large swath of territory			1
" that means that a terrorist attack is highly likely , but there is no intelligence to suggest that an attack is imminent , " home secretary @entity113 said			0
the " root cause " of @entity1 's terror threat is " @entity39 extremism , " @entity0 said friday			1
the execution of @entity124 journalist @entity123 is clear evidence that @entity8 ' fight in @entity37 and @entity36 " is not some foreign conflict thousands of miles from home that we can hope to ignore , " he said			1
@entity8 is unlike other @entity39 extremist groups in its primary focus not to find a country that can be its base of operations , but to create its own country			0
and the group has had ample success in that regard , given the vast reach already of what it calls the " @entity143			0
" while it 's been widely reviled internationally , @entity8 has managed to attract some support among @entity145 and drawn foreign fighters , like the masked man with an apparent @entity1 accent who took part in @entity123 's beheading			1
even without specific threats in the @entity152 , @entity8 ' track record in @entity36 and @entity37 -- where it was known to massacre minorities , forcefully institute @entity156 law and stage executions and stonings -- suggests it may be capable of anything			2
@entity0 said the group poses a " greater and deeper " threat than @entity1 has known before			1
@entity0 said military force is among the tools that can be used against @entity8 , while adding that aid , diplomacy and political influence should also be part of @entity1 's response			2
while the threat level just went up friday , @entity1 's national policing lead for counterterrorism , @entity172 , said that police have been escalating their efforts to combat the jihadist threat for months			1
he claimed 69 arrests in the first half of 2014 for offenses ranging from funding " terrorist activity through to the preparation and / or instigation of terrorism acts and traveling abroad for terrorist training			0
" @entity124 terror threat level @entity124 officials said last week there were no plans to raise the @entity124 ' terror threat level			2
@entity190 spokesman @entity189 said he did not anticipate the threat level would rise anytime soon , and @entity124 secretary of homeland security @entity192 said there was no specific threat against the @entity124			2
" the @entity124 and the @entity1 are in constant touch to discuss the threats we face and steps we can take separately and together to address them			2
we 're not going to comment on specific new domestic measures the prime minister proposed today other than to say we will continue to work together closely in the days , weeks and months ahead , " @entity202 spokeswoman @entity201 said in a written statement monday			0
" for our part the @entity206 will continue to take vigorous and prudent steps informed by the latest intelligence , building on our established security measures and potentially through additional efforts , both seen and unseen , to combat any terrorist threat , " she said			1
