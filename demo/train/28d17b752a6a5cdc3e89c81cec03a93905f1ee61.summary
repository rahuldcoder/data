@entity0 , @entity1 -- visiting his former village in rural @entity1 , @entity3 was the epitome of a success story			1
he had escaped poverty , earned a college degree and moved to @entity9 , where he studied at an @entity11 school and planned to put a down payment on a house in @entity14			2
he 'd often come back to @entity1 , passing out school supplies to children			1
but on one particular trip home in 2001 , he realized he had to do more			0
" we woke up in the morning , and grandmothers had lined up all around the house , stretching way back			2
... the whole village had gathered , " @entity3 said			1
" all these women walked miles and miles			0
" @entity26 estimates that 1.2 million children in @entity1 have lost one or both parents to aids - related illnesses , and @entity3 said it 's often grandmothers who have to pick up the slack			1
" you see the grandmothers over and over whose own children have died and left them , " he said			1
" some of them have up to 14 ( grandchildren ) to raise in their homes			0
sometimes the child has @entity41 , they need medication			1
" the grandmothers who gathered in @entity3 's childhood village begged @entity3 to help them			1
and he felt an obligation to give more than just pens , pencils and paper			0
" these are women who had seen me grow up in the village , " he said			2
" they carried me when i was hurt , they prayed for me when i was away studying			0
what was i supposed to do ? " knowing that education had been so key to his success , @entity3 and his wife decided to use their life savings to start a free school in the village			1
they purchased two acres of land and built the @entity69 , brick by brick , with the help of local volunteers			0
when the school officially launched on january 2 , 2003 , 56 @entity41 orphans were the first students			1
" we provide them uniforms			0
we give them shoes , " said @entity3 , 41			1
" everything we give ... is to try and eliminate as many obstacles as possible , so children can be successful and focus on education			0
" early on , it was noticed that many children in the school were falling asleep because of hunger and malnutrition			2
so the school began providing students two meals a day			0
there is also a medical clinic on site			0
meanwhile , @entity3 continued to raise money for the project while he worked full time in the @entity9			2
when he learned that a child had walked more than 30 miles to attend the school , he started a second school , the @entity101 , in the village of @entity103			2
today , between the two schools , there are 587 students -- kindergarten through 12th grade -- receiving a free education and health care			0
nearly all of them have lost either one or both parents to @entity41 - related illnesses			1
the issue hits especially close to home for @entity3 , who has lost his brother , one of his sisters and a 3 - year - old nephew to the disease			1
@entity3 says he felt fortunate to have the financial means to help his brother 's children financially , but in many similar cases , children end up homeless			1
" many of them are on the streets in @entity129 eating from the dust bins , " @entity3 said			2
" you see all these street children because they have no one to help them			0
" it 's these children @entity3 says he thinks about as he raises funds and awareness for his schools			1
" ( we ) take care of nearly 600 children in school , " he said			2
" that leaves all these children who are walking around without an opportunity to get an education , to get health care , to get a meal to eat or even to get somebody to say , ' i love you			0
' " do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2012 @entity153 of the students at his schools , @entity3 estimates that 65 % of them are being raised by their grandmothers , many of whom are often without adequate health care , finances or basic housing			1
so in 2008 , he started a program that offers support and education to the nearly 7,000 area grandmothers who are raising their grandchildren			1
the program teaches the women practical life skills , offering advice on parenting , grief management , basic medical care , gardening and business development			0
@entity3 says that by giving grandmothers access to microfunds , allowing them to start small businesses and make money , more children have access to an education			1
and by giving seeds to the grandmothers to grow , more children have access to food			2
grandmothers " are the pillars in the society , holding the society together , " he said			0
" they are unsung heroes that people do n't recognize			0
" every grandmother in the program , @entity3 said , has received some form of training or household equipment to improve their life			2
and his organization has also opened a library , started a gardening program and installed a clean - water system to benefit the entire village			1
@entity3 , whose organization is based in @entity208 and is funded by individual donations and private foundations , spends much of his time fundraising , speaking and raising awareness			1
he travels to @entity1 about three times a year			2
he hopes this younger generation will lift the country out of poverty and create a better future for their families and communities			0
he says he dreams about building a school in every district in @entity1			1
" i want to be an uncle for many so we can create other children who would be successful and do great things , " he said			0
" it 's giving them a hand up , just holding somebody 's hand , trying to get ( them ) out of the pigeonhole they are in			0
... " i feel humbled looking in the faces of the children smiling , focused on what their dreams are going to be			0
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity242 website at @entity243 and see how to help .			0

it 's estimated that 1.2 million children in @entity1 have lost a parent to @entity41 - related illnesses
@entity3 opened a school in his former village to help many of these children
@entity3 is also supporting area grandmothers who have been raising them
