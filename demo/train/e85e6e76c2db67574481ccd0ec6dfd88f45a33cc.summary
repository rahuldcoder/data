-- @entity1 is billed as the " happiest place on @entity3 , " but it 's anything but in the subversive new film , " @entity6			1
" @entity8 's directorial debut focuses on a man who slowly descends into madness while vacationing with his wife and children : grim reality keeps intruding onto a theme park experience designed to banish every moment of melancholy			1
in @entity8 's vision , jolly @entity18 characters become fearsome ghouls ; an epidemic of " cat flu " threatens to sicken visitors ; an undercurrent of sex runs through this place meant to stand for innocent family fun			1
it 's a darkly comic and unflattering critique of @entity18 culture			1
so why would @entity18 ever allow @entity8 to shoot his movie inside @entity32 and @entity1 ? the answer is it never gave him permission			1
@entity8 , his actors and crew infiltrated the parks without @entity18 ever catching on			1
the cinematic subterfuge went on for weeks ; @entity8 shot for about 10 days in @entity40 , @entity41 and even longer at @entity32 in @entity42 , @entity43			1
" there was high anxiety the entire time while we were making this film , " @entity8 admitted			1
he said the stress was so great , " i lost a ton of weight			2
i was 215 ( pounds ) and slimmed down to 168 by the end of this shoot			2
" pulling it off @entity8 said pulling of his unlikely feat required tremendous planning			1
" we were n't just running in there and improvising , ' oh , here 's a nice place to put the camera , ' " he said			2
" we did a lot of scouting ( in the parks )			2
we walked through the movie at least nine times before we brought in the actors			2
... the position of the sun was charted weeks ahead of time for every shot			1
" the movie includes several images of an eerily depopulated park -- not easy to arrange when contending with thousands of visitors			2
" as soon as they opened the doors we sort of rushed in and got the shot ( of the empty park ) , " @entity8 recalled			1
" we had like maybe 20 seconds before people would get into ( the frame )			2
" why @entity18 might want to ' @entity6 ' technological breakthrough @entity8 understood there was no way he could shoot his movie with anything like a traditional motion picture camera			1
a breakthrough came courtesy of the @entity91 camera -- a digital slr that can shoot high - quality video			0
" the @entity91 's small size and low - light capabilities were what made everything possible , allowing me the freedom to set up shots and move fast without sacrificing picture quality , " @entity8 explained in a " director 's statement " that accompanies press notes for the film ( @entity8 told @entity0 he has n't been paid anything by @entity99 to sing the praises of its product )			1
the innocent looking camera was key to avoiding detection by @entity18 security			1
" the thing about those parks is everyone has a camera there , " @entity8 said			1
" so we were not the few people with cameras in the midst of a crowd of people			0
we probably would have looked out of place if we did n't have cameras			0
" but shooting video was only half the equation ; just as big a challenge was figuring out how to record the actors ' dialogue			2
once again , technology came to the rescue			0
" what we ended ( up ) doing was using these tiny @entity136 pocket recorders that business people use mainly for dictation purposes , " @entity8 explained in his director 's statement			1
" they 're great because they run for 18 hours straight on one battery ; they have an auto - leveler function ; they record almost at cd quality ; and they have a mic input , so i could easily run a standard lavalier mic into them			0
" we had a shot list for every single shot			2
we kept those on our phones , as well as our scripts , " @entity8 said			1
it 's a @entity157 to get the shots of @entity18 attractions that he needed , @entity8 , his crew and actors had to board the rides -- repeatedly			1
" i think we rode ' it 's a @entity165 ' 12 times in a row , " @entity8 said			1
" and it was not a low park attendance day			0
there were a lot of people there			0
so , every time we were in line for probably 40 minutes			0
so that 's all we did that day was ride ' @entity157			0
' that was a rough day			0
" the team used @entity178 whenever possible , but that only helped so much , as when they filmed a sequence at @entity32 's @entity182 ride			2
" it was such a busy day ( at the park ) the line even with a @entity186 was 25 minutes			0
" paying @entity18 back @entity18 has n't filed suit against @entity8 despite his ample use of the company 's copyrighted images ( no doubt concluding a lawsuit would only increase public awareness of " @entity6 " )			1
@entity18 did get something out of it : @entity8 estimates he spent between $ 15,000 and $ 20,000 on season passes to the parks to accommodate his cast and crew			1
and then of course there was food			0
" we ate all our meals in the park , " @entity8 said			1
" it was just easier , more convenient			0
" the director 's favorite @entity18 eatery ? the @entity207 in @entity32			1
" they have these bread bowls with clam chowder or gumbo and they 're fantastic			0
" to @entity18 or not to @entity18 ? the closest call @entity8 said to the best of his knowledge no @entity18 park patrons ever caught on that a film was being made right in their midst			1
he and his crew also managed to escape detection by @entity18 security personnel , until near the end of filming in @entity42			1
then suddenly , after weeks of surreptitious shooting , the game was almost up			1
" there was a moment when the actors had to enter the park through the turnstiles a few times , " @entity8 recalled			1
" we had to do multiple takes of them walking into the park			0
and at one point a security officer came to our lead actor ( @entity236 ) and asked if he was famous			0
... he said no and then they asked , ' why do you have paparazzi following you ? ' " @entity236 and @entity240 , who plays his wife , had to do a quick improv to throw the officer off the scent			0
" i said ( to @entity240 ) , ' hey , honey , they think we 're famous ! ' " @entity236 recalled			0
" yeah , all of a sudden now we 're really acting , " @entity240 said			0
when the officer asked why the pair had entered and then re-entered the park twice within a matter of minutes , they explained they had left their sunscreen in the car and had to go back to apply it on their kids			0
the actors realized it would be tough to explain why they were wearing sound recording equipment , so they said the young actors playing their kids needed to use the restroom			0
they took that opportunity to stash the equipment			0
" i put it in my sock , which i thought was the last place they would maybe look , " @entity236 said			0
" there are n't that many choices when you 're wearing a pair of shorts			0
" @entity236 , @entity240 and their movie kids profited from a passing parade to disperse into the crowd , and then hightail it out of the park			0
a close call , but the actors said by that point they were used to shooting on the sly			1
" it was exciting , " @entity236 said			0
said @entity240 , " luckily that was our only close encounter			2
we pulled off all the other things			0
" all is ( almost ) lost but even after they finished shooting in the parks , the filmmakers ' troubles were n't over			2
screening the footage he had captured in @entity40 , @entity8 's heart sank			2
there was a big blotch on the video -- all of it			0
" it was through every shot , " @entity8 said			1
" i thought , ' the whole film is ruined ! we have a giant black dot near the center of the movie for everything ! ' " the culprit was tree sap that had somehow slimed the camera 's sensor			0
@entity8 still does n't know how it happened , but the digital gods smiled on him and a company in @entity311 was able to remove the blemishes in post-production			2
another escape for " @entity6			2
" @entity8 consistently beat the odds to get his movie made and into theaters : first by eluding @entity18 security , then earning a spot in the @entity320 ( where the film premiered in january ) and ultimately finding a distributor willing to risk the wrath of the @entity18			1
but when he returned to @entity42 for an interview with @entity0 just outside @entity32 property , @entity8 felt understandably apprehensive			2
" it 's strange being back here in the belly of the beast , " he said			0
" i feel like a mouse 's hand is going to cover my face with chloroform at any moment and drag me away			0

" @entity6 " was filmed surreptitiously at @entity18 parks
