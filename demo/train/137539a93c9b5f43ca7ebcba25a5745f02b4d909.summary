-- president @entity1 told @entity3 graduates that the @entity4 faces " difficult days ahead " in its fight against insurgents in @entity7 and said that the threat posed by @entity10 operatives across the globe " will not go away soon			1
" speaking at the @entity3 commencement in @entity13 , @entity1 praised the graduates for their achievements and laid out a scenario of military and societal challenges in what is the ninth @entity3 commencement during the wars in @entity19 and @entity7 and the fight against international terrorism			1
" this time of war began in @entity7 , a place that may seem as far from this peaceful bend in the @entity28 as anywhere on @entity30 , " @entity1 said , referring to a conflict that started after the @entity10 terror network attacked the @entity4 on september 11 , 2001			1
" the war began only because our own cities and civilians were attacked by violent extremists who plotted from that distant place , and it continues only because that plotting persists to this day			0
" while the @entity4 and its allies battled in @entity7 , the @entity4 military launched an invasion of @entity19 in 2003 , toppling the @entity42 regime and battling insurgents for years until that war began to wind down in the last couple of years			2
but the @entity7 conflict persists as the @entity4 and its allies battle tenacious militants from the @entity49 militant movement			2
@entity1 said as the @entity19 war ends , @entity4 is " pressing forward in @entity7 " and faces a " tough fight " against a nimble insurgency			1
" from @entity56 to @entity57 , that is what the @entity49 has done through assassination , indiscriminate killing and intimidation , " @entity1 said , referring to the main militant and two southern @entity7 battlegrounds			1
" and any country that has known decades of war will be tested in finding political solutions to its problems , and providing governance that can sustain progress and serve the needs of its people			0
" @entity1 said that even though the nature of the war has changed in the past nine years , it remains just as important as it was after the 9/11 attacks on the @entity76 and @entity77			2
he said the @entity4 has helped bring hope and sovereign government to @entity7 , but " there will be difficult days ahead			2
" " we toppled the @entity49 regime ; now we must break the momentum of a @entity49 insurgency and train @entity7 security forces , " he said			2
" we will adapt , we will persist , and i have no doubt that together with our @entity7 and international partners , we will succeed in @entity7			1
" as for @entity10 's activities , @entity1 defended the " campaign to disrupt , dismantle and to defeat @entity10 , " saying it 's an " international effort that is necessary and just			1
" while he said there has been " more success in eliminating @entity10 leaders in recent months than in recent years , " the group will continue its recruitment efforts			0
" we see that in bombs that go off in @entity97 and @entity98			0
we see it in attempts to blow up an airliner over @entity102 or an suv in @entity104 , even as these failed attacks show that pressure on networks like @entity10 is forcing them to rely on terrorists with less time and space to train , " he said			0
" we see it in @entity10 's gross distortion of @entity114 , their disrespect for human life , and their attempts to prey upon fear and hatred and prejudice			1
" @entity1 dismissed @entity10 and its affiliates as " small men on the wrong side of history , " but acknowledged that the threat they pose " will not go away soon			1
" " this is a different kind of war , " he said			0
" there will be no simple moment of surrender to mark the journey 's end			0
no armistice or banner headline			0
" the president said @entity4 's " strength and resilience " will counter people attempting to sow fear			0
" terrorists want to scare us , " he said , but " @entity13 go about their lives unafraid			0
extremists want a war between @entity4 and @entity114 , but muslims are a part of our national life , including those who serve in our @entity148			0
adversaries want to divide us , but we are united by our support for you -- soldiers who send a clear message that this country is both the land of the free and the home of the brave			0
" @entity1 made reference to @entity3 's diversity , pointing out that women in uniform are playing " indispensable role in our national defense			1
" they include @entity3 's no. 1 overall cadet and valedictorian , @entity166 and @entity167			1
@entity1 noted it was the first time the academy 's two top awards were earned by female cadets			1
" @entity172 represents the full breadth of the @entity4 experience , " with cadets hailing from all walks of life , @entity1 said			2
the president noted that one thing that sets the cadets apart is that they " have come together to prepare for the most difficult tests of our time " and know they are being sent into " harm 's way			2
" " and through a period when too many of our institutions have acted irresponsibly , the @entity4 military has set a standard of service and sacrifice that is as great as any in this nation 's history , " he said			0
@entity1 also stressed that economic and technological innovation " must be a foundation of @entity4 power " and that the efforts of @entity4 's armed forces must be complemented by effective diplomacy , world development and security			1
" we need intelligence agencies that work seamlessly with their counterparts to unravel plots that run from the mountains of @entity207 to the streets of our cities ; law enforcement that can strengthen judicial systems abroad and protect us at home ; and first responders who can act swiftly in the event of earthquakes , storms and disease			0
" @entity1 said the world 's burdens can not just be @entity4 's , and alliances that has served the @entity4 well must be maintained , strengthened and widened			1
" the international order we seek is one that can resolve the challenges of our times -- countering violent extremism and insurgency ; stopping the spread of nuclear weapons and securing nuclear materials ; combating a changing climate and sustaining global growth ; helping countries feed themselves and care for their sick ; preventing conflict and healing its wounds			0
