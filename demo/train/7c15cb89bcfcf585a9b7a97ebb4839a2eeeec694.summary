@entity0 , @entity1 -- when a 12 - day - old boy died in her arms , @entity3 was devastated			1
she was working as a volunteer in the maternity clinic at one of the largest hospitals in @entity0 , @entity1			1
at that time -- october 2000 -- such incidents were n't that unusual ; on average , at least one infant a day died at the overcrowded and underfunded facility			0
but when @entity3 learned that the baby 's teenage mother had not been able to raise the money for treatment that would 've saved his life , she was crushed			1
" his mother [ needed ] $ 30 that i had in my pocket			0
i will never forget that , " she said			0
" it was a preventable death			0
" less than a week later , @entity3 endured another , more personal loss : her second son , 16 - month - old @entity26 , died in a tragic accident when he fell from the balcony of her home			1
she was overwhelmed by grief			0
" it was agony , " said @entity3			1
" i did n't want any mother to feel the same pain , so ... i took action			0
" the successful businesswoman sold her international trading company and dedicated herself to helping the city 's most impoverished children and their young mothers			1
in the last 10 years , her @entity41 -- named for her late son -- has brought health care to tens of thousands of children in @entity0 and provided more than 2,000 teenage mothers with counseling , education and job training			1
at first , @entity3 focused on lowering the infant mortality rate at the hospital where she 'd volunteered			1
it was more than double the national average			0
she built a state - of - the - art neo-natal unit , brought in experts to train the clinic 's staff and established a program to cover the medical costs for babies born to impoverished mothers			1
five years later , the rate of infant deaths at the hospital had dropped 67 %			0
from the start , @entity3 noticed that 70 % of the mothers she was working with were between the ages of 14 and 16			1
most lived in the slums outside of the city , which have grown during the last decade as people have fled violence in the northern areas of the country			0
" you see these girls , [ with ] their tiny faces ... they 're babies holding babies , " said @entity3 , 42			1
she realized that the only way to ensure the long - term health of the children was to enable these teenage girls to break the cycle of poverty			1
" when a girl gets pregnant , she drops out of school			2
... next year , she 's going to be pregnant again , " @entity3 said			1
" she 's repeating the same patterns of the mother , the grandmother			2
" the @entity1 government reports that nearly 20 % of girls between 15 and 19 years old are or have been pregnant -- nearly triple the @entity91 rate			1
in @entity0 , where one - third of residents live at or below the poverty line , it 's an equation that means these young mothers have very little chance of improving their lives			1
@entity3 is hoping to change that through her teen mothers program , which aims to teach young women how to support themselves and their children			1
it started with just 30 girls in 2002 , but it has expanded in the last decade			2
with the opening of her foundation 's new center last year , 400 pregnant teens and young mothers now enroll every year			1
built in one of the city 's many slums , the center is an elegant , modern structure , equipped with a daycare , medical center , cafeteria and classrooms			2
it 's light years away from the impoverished world of these teen mothers			1
for @entity3 , that 's the whole point			1
" when they come here , this is a piece of heaven [ on ] @entity125 , " she said			0
" they deserve the very best			0
" for the first year , young mothers come to the center every weekday , leaving their babies at the daycare while they attend classes			2
they receive instruction on basic hygiene -- many have never encountered indoor plumbing before -- and learn how to care for their infants			0
because food is often scarce at home , the girls also receive a hearty hot lunch			2
during the first six months , the teens take part in therapy sessions to help them understand their new reality and responsibilities			0
@entity3 says that many of the teens she 's worked with have been victims of rape and sexual abuse , so counselors work intensively with each girl			1
the goal is to help them come to terms with their past so they can focus on the future			0
the center also teaches teenage mothers about reproductive health and contraception			2
" girls tell me they do n't understand how they got pregnant			2
they think it 's from a kiss , " @entity3 said			1
" they do n't know that the option of using condoms exists			0
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity171 while the program aims to prevent future pregnancies , @entity3 also wants to give these young mothers the tools they need to change their lives			1
the girls can finish high school on site , take computer classes or learn vocational skills like sewing or jewelry - making			2
the teens also make and sell products at the center 's bakery , which helps fund the program , and the foundation offers micro-loans to help them start their own businesses			2
the program also helps mothers find jobs or provides them scholarships to help them continue their education at a trade school or university			2
the teens return to the center every week so @entity3 's staff can track their progress and assist with any problems			1
within two to four years , @entity3 wants her girls to be providing for their families and be on their way to a better life			1
she says that two - thirds of those who 've completed the program have gone on to find jobs			0
" i want my girls to be empowered , " she said			0
" earning money provides them with independence and allows them to gain back control of their lives			0
" that 's exactly what @entity219 has been able to do			0
she dropped out of school when she got pregnant at 16 , but through @entity3 's foundation , she enrolled in a beauty salon course			1
she recently earned her diploma , an accomplishment that makes her glow with pride			0
" i feel great , since i was able to accomplish a goal that i had wanted , " @entity219 said			0
" now i am working in the best beauty salon ... earning a good salary			0
" she said @entity3 and the program gave her a new outlook on life			2
" it is better to go forward with my future , to not just sit around like other girls , " she said			0
" because i have been a fighter , i have found a better future for my child			0
... i will keep fighting so he can have everything			0
" @entity3 believes that attitude change is what will help these young mothers have long - term success			1
for her , each girl she helps is cause for celebration			0
" these teen mothers are my own daughters , " @entity3 said			1
" when they get here and they make it through , i feel so proud of them			0
" @entity3 is always looking for more ways to have more impact			2
in 2005 , she established a medical clinic that has provided health care to more than 84,000 low - income residents of the community -- mostly young mothers and their children			1
and she 's planning to build an early childhood education center where the girls can bring their children ages 1 - 5			1
in the coming years , she is hoping to expand her program throughout @entity1			2
while @entity3 has accomplished a great deal in the last decade , one thing is clear : her personal war on poverty has just begun			2
" i 'm so passionate about it because we are seeing progress			0
... we are changing the lives of these girls , " @entity3 said			1
" i wake up every single morning thinking , ' what else can i do to help them ? ' " want to get involved ? check out the @entity41 website at @entity280 and see how to help			0
