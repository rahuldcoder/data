editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity18 , @entity19 ( @entity5 ) -- according to @entity22 's @entity21 , fraud costs @entity22 taxpayers an estimated £ 30 billion ( $ 47 million ) every year ; globally , the figure is a staggering $ 3 trillion , an amount larger than the gdps of the @entity22 , @entity27 , and @entity28			1
in april 2011 , vice was introduced to @entity29 , a convicted fraudster and one of @entity22 's most successful career criminals			1
during his career , sales banked an estimated £ 10 million through various financial scams , ultimately spending six rather luxurious years of his life on the lamb			2
sales introduced us to a number of players in @entity18 's vast underground fraud network , who tutored us in various scams that , cumulatively , cost every adult in @entity22 £ 621 ( $ 1,000 ) a year			1
a number of those we met were young , working - class men , most in their late teens or early 20s			0
one young fraudster explained that he first started scamming online to finance his wrestling action figure collection , though when he discovered how easy it was to obtain purloined credit card numbers , he graduated to more expensive items like sneakers , stereo equipment and large grocery orders ( which , he claims , are then given to local single mothers )			2
we were allowed to watch as he plied his trade , but his identity was never known to us and we were blindfolded for the round trip to his apartment			0
see the rest of @entity22 fraud at @entity5 we also spent time with a @entity67 underworld figure calling himself mr. @entity69 , the purveyor of a strangely ingenious scheme called " wash , wash			1
" gold convinces other criminals -- including , he claims , members of the @entity77 -- that he has obtained large amounts of cash that once belonged to @entity81			2
he then charges his victim thousands of pounds to " wash " the former @entity85 leader 's " dirty money , " which has been stained brown for " reasons of security			2
" the cleaning fluid , @entity73 explains , is prohibitively expensive and can only be obtained by bribing military personnel			0
despite the absurdity of the scam , he claims it has netted him hundreds of thousands of pounds			0
how did we gain access to this world ? well , @entity29 argues that he is now a reformed fraudster , and hopes that this documentary will demonstrate to the @entity22 government that they should employ him to help combat fraud			1
we wish him all the best .			0
