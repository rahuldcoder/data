-- @entity2 's burial was hardly fit for a king			1
the awkward position of the @entity7 monarch 's body , and the inferior quality of his grave , suggests medieval gravediggers placed him there in a hurry or did n't care much for him , according to researchers			1
@entity20 archaeologists , in the first academic paper since the discovery of his skeleton under a parking lot , said @entity2 's body was buried in @entity22 , central @entity7 , " with minimal reverence			1
" the king , 32 , was killed at the @entity25 in 1485			0
it was the last fight in the @entity27 , which ended with the ascension of @entity29 and the @entity30			0
@entity2 's naked body was returned to @entity22 for public display before he was interred three days after death			1
his torso was lowered into a too - short grave , leaving it in an " odd position " that left the head partially propped up against the grave side			0
" only a little extra effort by the gravediggers to tidy the grave ends would have made this grave long enough to receive the body conventionally , " the @entity22 researchers wrote in an article published friday in the journal @entity43			1
" that they did not , instead placing the body on one side of the grave , its torso crammed against the northern side , may suggest haste or little respect for the deceased			2
" they suggested one possible factor			0
" the haste may partially be explained by the fact that @entity2 's damaged body had already been on public display for several days in the height of summer , and was thus in poor condition			1
" @entity2 was discovered buried among the remains of what was once the city 's @entity68 friary			1
other graves were of correct length and neat rectangular with vertical sides , according to researchers			2
" this grave was an untidy lozenge shape with a concave base and sloping sides , leaving the bottom of the grave much smaller than its extent at ground level , " researchers wrote			2
there was no evidence of a shroud or coffin			0
in february , scientists announced that they were convinced " beyond reasonable doubt " that the skeleton belonged to @entity2			1
@entity90 extracted from the bones was matched to @entity92 , a @entity93 cabinetmaker and direct descendant of @entity2 's sister , @entity96 , and a second distant relative , who wished to remain anonymous			1
experts say other evidence -- including battle wounds and signs of scoliosis , or curvature of the spine -- found during the search and the more than four months of tests since strongly supported the dna findings			1
@entity2 met a very violent death some of findings have been publicized before			2
the king 's feet had been lost at some point in the intervening five centuries , but the rest of the bones were in good condition , which archaeologists and historians say was incredibly lucky , given how close later building work came to them -- brick foundations ran alongside part of the trench , within inches of the body			1
archaeologists said their examination of the skeleton shows @entity2 met a violent death : they found evidence of 10 wounds -- eight to the head and two to the body -- which they believe were inflicted at or around the time of death			1
wounds to the face and two other cuts to the body may be " humiliation injuries " delivered after death , scientists said			2
the skeleton also showed marks that could have come from period - appropriate weapons			0
in particular , a large wound at the base of his skull seemed likely to have been made by a blade like a halberd			0
other wounds seemed similar to those inflicted by daggers and knives of the time			0
@entity2 's hands also may have been bound			2
more recent analysis of the remains , using radiocarbon dating , indicates a high - protein diet , heavy on seafood , indicating a high status in society			0
after centuries of demolition and rebuilding work , the exact location of @entity2 's grave had been lost to history , and there were even reports that the defeated monarch 's body had been dug up and thrown into a nearby river			1
" the skull was in good condition , although fragile , and was able to give us detailed information , " bioarchaeologist @entity174 , who led the exhumation of the remains in 2012 , said earlier this year			0
clues coaxed from the skeleton may shed " a new light " on the physical description of @entity2 as a humpbacked man with a " withered arm , " which was used to support history 's evil image of him , professor @entity188 , head of the @entity22 's @entity189 , said then			1
one immediate discovery was that the skeleton does not have a " withered arm " as depicted by @entity193 , researchers said			0
while not humpbacked , @entity2 did suffer from the " severe scoliosis " that appeared to start around the time of puberty , they said			2
the king will finally get respect next year			0
his remains will be reburied in @entity201 , close to the site of his original grave			0
@entity0 's @entity205 , @entity206 and @entity207 contributed to this report .			0

researchers *update* their research on @entity2
they say gravediggers appeared to be in a hurry , may have shown *disrespect*
archaeologists found the body of a man buried *beneath* a parking lot in @entity22
dna tests confirm " beyond reasonable doubt " the identity of the bones
