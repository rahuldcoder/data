@entity0 -- it began when @entity4 's veterinarian recommended she stop feeding meat and dairy to her beloved mutt , @entity8 , to determine whether a food allergy was to blame for the dog 's chronic ear infection			1
@entity4 's interest was immediately piqued			1
she had been a vegan for nearly two years , after deciding to cut meat , eggs and dairy from her diet for health and ethical reasons			1
but she never considered the possibility that she could align her dog 's diet with hers			1
" i 've had animals all my life and when i did look into a vegan diet for my cat , i read that cats ca n't be vegan ... so i went to the conclusion that we ca n't do this for @entity8 , " says @entity4 , an environmental consultant and part - time vegan baker from @entity24 , @entity25			1
with her doctor 's guidance , she began whipping up batches of pinto beans , brown rice and sweet potatoes each week			2
she fed them to 4 - year - old @entity8 , a @entity42 shepherd / pit bull mix , twice daily with a dose of probiotics at lunch to help her digest			1
five months later , @entity8 's ear infection is gone , @entity4 says			1
her coat has taken on a healthy shine and she no longer has bad breath , dandruff or excessive shedding , she says			1
her vet at the @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity25 , suggested incorporating calcium and iron supplements through a diet of leafy greens or a vegan nutritional capsule			1
" her health and well - being is the main thing for us , but that fact we have a vegan option is a double - benefit because it means our dog can live with the same ideology , " she says			2
with the vegan diet enjoying a period of ( mostly ) positive widespread exposure , it should come as little surprise that vegetarian or vegan pet owners might want to project those ideals onto their canine companions			2
celebrities such as @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 ( who discusses her dogs ' vegan diet in her book , " @entity85 " ) have long been touting the health benefits of a vegan diet , along with @entity88 and @entity89 , two doctors who are the subjects of an upcoming documentary extolling the benefits of the plant - based diet			1
a steady stream in recent years of publications , from @entity97 's 2009 book " @entity98 " to this year 's @entity100 bestseller , " @entity101 , " also have lent the movement some credibility			0
read " vegan on the silver screen " it 's even caught the attention of talk show host and professional trendsetter @entity109			0
@entity109 recently challenged her staff to go vegan for a week , with the help of " @entity101 " author and nutritionist @entity114			0
the experiment led to a collective weight loss of 440 pounds and a pledge from @entity109 to go " vegan - ish " and institute meatless mondays at @entity119			0
the notion of a holistic approach that gives pet owners more control over their pets ' diet has been gaining ground since 2007 , when a melamine contamination of commercial pet food caused people to take a closer look at what they were feeding their pets , says @entity134 , a veterinary internal medicine specialist who runs @entity137 , an animal nutrition consultancy			1
" that was a turning point that led to more home - cooked meals and raw food diets			0
vegetarianism is another subset of that backlash , " she says			0
@entity134 and six other pet experts who spoke with @entity1 conceded -- some more reluctantly than others -- that most dogs could biologically live on a vegan diet			1
but doing so requires substantial attention to creating a balanced diet that makes up for the loss of animal protein with substitutions of beans , soy and , to a lesser extent , vegetables and grains			1
dogs are classified in the order @entity163 , but , unlike cats ( a topic for another day ) they have evolved biologically as omnivores , meaning their systems can derive nutrients from a wide variety of sources , including fruits , vegetables , grains , legumes and animal products			1
" the important thing is that you use a diet that has been shown to be nutritionally adequate for whatever stage of life you 're feeding , and it is absolutely possible to find a good quality commercial pet food that does n't have animal products in it , " says veterinarian @entity176 , an associate professor of nutrition at the @entity179 's @entity178			1
she recommended using only commercial pet food that has gone through @entity188 feeding trials			0
or , if you prefer to cook meals from scratch , consult a credentialed expert in dog nutrition to ensure a proper balance of essential nutrients			0
whether dogs can thrive on a vegan diet elicits different shades of responses			1
" if you go to @entity200 you can see dogs living on the scraps			0
they can survive on almost nothing once they 've evolved to living on the streets , but is that what 's best ? " says pet expert and author @entity207 , host of the radio show " @entity210			0
" " if a dog has a choice he 's not picking a pile of beans over chicken or meat , and he 's not going to be lapping up soy , " she says			1
" if you 're going to be harmonious in your choices , be harmonious			0
i say respect each species for what it was meant to be , and if you feel that strongly about being vegan , get a vegetarian animal			0
" dogs have a significantly higher daily protein requirement than humans			2
finding protein sources that provide adequate amounts of nutrients such as amino acids in the sufficient ratio can be difficult under the vegan approach , which relies on plant protein sources that have less biologic value than meat protein , @entity134 says			2
" vegetarian pet foods require the addition of synthetic amino acids to fill nutritional gaps or a much higher overall protein level to supply all of the essential amino acids			0
overall , it is much easier and more reliable to supply a dog 's essential nutrients in a food containing both plants and meat , " she says			1
the vegan diet also lacks some essential fatty acids that are only available in animal products like butter and fish oils , says veterinarian @entity257 , former president of the @entity259 @entity258 and author of " @entity261 , @entity262			2
" @entity257 , a lacto - ovo vegetarian who feeds his dogs an omnivorous diet prepared at home , says the best approach for dogs -- and humans -- is a varied diet from organic ingredients			1
he says some adult dogs do adapt and even thrive on well - balanced vegan diets , but contends that dogs do best with a variety of foods that include some animals fats and protein			1
" dogs have evolved to a degree , but they 've been with us 45,000 years as camp followers , scavengers , village dogs in the third - world countries and they 'll eat just about anything , " he says , adding that dogs could benefit from a vegan meal at least once a week to detox			0
" but then again , we do n't have the real science to back up whether it 's safe enough , so , for dogs ' sake , we need to adopt the cautionary principle			2
" the first thing doctors tend to ask is why someone is considering a vegan diet , @entity257 says			0
in most cases , personal ethics are the primary motivator , followed by food allergies			0
in the latter category , a vegan diet can bring relief , veterinarian @entity301 says			0
" i 've seen many dogs with food allergies , and often switching to a vegan diet can help them , " says may , who is vegan			2
" they also avoid taking in animal by - products from commercially produced dog food , including slaughterhouse waste products and rejects that would n't be fit for human consumption			2
we 've seen a lot of cancer and other degenerative diseases in dogs in recent years so it 's easy to suspect that pet food could be a contributor			2
" for those who have embraced a vegan diet for their dogs , they say they have living and breathing proof that it works			2
@entity331 , an editor for a scientific nonprofit society in @entity0 , has raised her two dogs vegan since she they came to live with her , two and a half years ago			0
she feeds them a prepared blend of dried vegetables , fruits and herbs that she mixes with water and either tofu , beans or textured vegetable protein			0
" i get the occasional weird look , but any doubters seem to feel much better once they meet @entity347 and @entity348 and see that they 're normal , healthy , energetic and rambunctious little dogs , " she says			0
@entity1 's @entity350 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 's vet suggested cutting meat , dairy from dog 's diet to *diagnose* ear infection
five months later , @entity8 's ear infection and bad breath is gone , @entity4 says
vets say dogs -- but not cats -- can adapt to balanced omnivore diet
question up for grabs is whether dogs can thrive on diet free of animal protein
