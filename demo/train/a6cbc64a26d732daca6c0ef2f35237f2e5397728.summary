-- if they were handing out awards for courage in the face of personal trauma , 70 - year - old @entity1 would scoop the lot at this week 's @entity8			1
@entity1 is one of just 13 golfers who have played in all 28 previous editions of the biggest tournament of its type in the world , which brings nearly 3,100 players from 25 countries and 49 states of the @entity18 to the @entity20 area of @entity21			1
his streak was nearly broken last year , and in the circumstances nobody would have held it against him if he had taken time out			1
just before the tournament , @entity27 , his wife of 22 years , was taken ill and passed away just a week later			1
there had been no hint of a problem -- @entity27 taught at a community school in @entity33 in @entity34 and played a bit of golf herself			0
" she mostly just walked the course with me , " recalled @entity1			1
her death hit him hard and he was left with the prospect of raising his then 15 - year - old son @entity40 alone			0
in the circumstances , his annual pilgrimage to @entity20 was low priority			0
" i had no interest in playing golf			0
" but with encouragement from his brother @entity47 , who has also played in every @entity48 , and crucially an intervention from his son , @entity1 did indeed pitch up			2
" @entity54 , mum would have wanted you to play , " said @entity40 and he did , thinking about @entity27 just about every step of the way			0
in retrospect , the stress of dealing with his wife 's premature death and continuing to practice as a business lawyer may well have taken a bigger toll on @entity1 than he was to realize			1
back in april , he was playing @entity63 , a course in @entity34 , when he collapsed with a heart attack			1
" i was on the second hole , felt real dizzy , next thing i know i woke up in the ambulance			0
" thankfully medical attention had arrived quickly			0
" they used cpr and got me back , and thankfully there was no permanent damage to my heart , " said @entity1 in a matter of fact way that belies its seriousness			1
brother @entity47 had suffered a similar problem a few years ago and his advice has helped @entity1 to make a full recovery , but doctors have advised him against playing when the temperature gauge goes into the mid- 90s			2
" the first time i went back on the course it was kind of scary , " he admitted			0
in a hot summer in the @entity88 , this has restricted his practice opportunities , but nothing was going to stop @entity1 from competing in his 29th @entity48			1
the tournament format sees golfers placed in " flights " of around 50 , playing on 60 courses in the @entity20 area ( including @entity96 and the @entity97 at @entity98 ) over four days of competition			2
the top player in each group , after adjustments are made for handicap -- " they are very quick to weed out the cheaters , " said @entity1 -- qualified for friday 's final 18 - hole shootout from which the top prizes are decided			1
remarkably , given the close nature of the competition , @entity108 , a 3.5 handicap player from @entity109 , has claimed the title for the past two years			0
@entity1 's best result is eighth in a flight , but like many others he is there for the enjoyment of golf and the camaraderie , meeting other old friends who come back year after year			1
they might also get the chance to rub shoulders with celebrities , such as baseball star @entity124 who has returned for a second year , while eight golfers have qualified from a regional competition in @entity127			1
the success of the @entity48 has led to a series of tournaments held under a similar format as the golfing industry looks to boost participation at all levels			0
@entity1 is a fully - fledged " @entity142 " and like so many others in the 1960s was inspired to take up golf by the exploits of @entity139 -- a fellow former student of @entity141			2
while not reaching professional standard , in his 20s @entity1 played to a challenging 5 or 6 handicap but is now an 18 - handicapper			2
he has met his hero a couple of times at golf functions and like so many others was impressed by @entity139 's friendliness and easy going manner			0
" he talks to you as if you were a next - door neighbor			0
" @entity1 knew that his recent illness and lack of practice was going to limit his chances of progressing , and a net 96 round on the first day sunk his chances			2
his brother played better but could not qualify from his super senior division			0
the former @entity163 pitcher shot a final round 77 for a net 69 to win his flight and qualify for a shot at the top prizes			0
but given his dice with death , @entity1 was happy to just be teeing it up and meeting old friends , doubtless already planning his 30th straight appearance in a unique event .			1

@entity175 brings together over 3,000 golfers
@entity1 has *battled* personal *adversity* to tee up for 29th straight time
his wife died before last year 's tournament and he had heart attack this year
