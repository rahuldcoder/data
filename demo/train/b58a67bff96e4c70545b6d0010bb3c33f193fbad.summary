-- 2009 has given employers and employees a run for their money -- literally			1
budgets have been cut , layoffs made and furloughs instituted , and benefits and perks have evaporated			1
at the beginning of the year , 38 percent of employers said the economy would force them to make administrative cuts sometime during 2009 , according to a survey by @entity0			1
sixty - five percent of those employers indicated that they would cut back company social events , 61 percent anticipated curtailing business travel , 25 percent expected to scale back on health - care benefits and 11 percent planned to reduce wellness benefits			1
other areas where companies planned to cut spending included special office perks , such as coffee , ice machines or discounted vending ( 34 percent ) , incentive trips ( 28 percent ) and philanthropic activities ( 21 percent )			0
such perks and benefits being taken away make for a tough situation for employees			1
not only are they working harder to keep their jobs , but workers have to do more for less			0
while some argue that it 's hard to keep employees motivated in this situation , others say that they should n't focus on incentives , but rather think about the bigger picture			2
" when perks and benefits are taken away , management often does this to allocate resources where they 're needed , elsewhere			1
the money being saved by not buying bagels every friday or purchasing @entity56 gifts for employees may be going towards your salary , " said @entity48 , founder and ceo of @entity50 , a staffing and recruiting firm			2
" if you had to choose between taking a salary cut and not having free coffee versus being let go , most employees would likely take the former			2
" @entity64 , coordinator for the @entity65 at @entity66 in @entity67 , @entity68 , agrees that it 's important not to focus on what is being taken away			0
she said that due to budgetary constraints , furloughs were implemented at the school ; but rather than get discouraged , she focused on the positive			0
" i reminded myself how blessed i was to even have a job , " @entity74 said			0
" we need to remind ourselves of our priorities in life , placing a greater emphasis on what we have -- not what we do n't			0
" communication is key although it 's understandable for employees to be upset , frustrated and discouraged when benefits or perks are taken away , @entity84 , founder and ceo of @entity85 , which specializes in helping organizations to keep employees engaged , said that employees are less likely to be upset if management communicates with employees			1
in fact , 82 percent of employees surveyed in @entity96 say that it 's important that their organization allow them to choose from a variety of benefits to meet their individual needs			1
the survey consisted of more than 3.3 million responses from 2,400 organizations			2
" if an organization 's leadership team simply decided amongst themselves which benefits would be best to cut , employees will commonly become upset and their engagement will be negatively affected , " @entity84 says			1
" open communication is a key driver of engagement , and employees will immediately recognize the fact that they had no voice in the situation			2
if leadership had simply asked employees which benefits were important to them , this situation may be avoided			1
" attitude is everything despite having to deal temporarily with a few displaced benefits or perks , there are benefits to sticking around with your employer until those things are reinstated			2
" it 's a good time to remember that the perks were never the reason that you liked the job			0
no one gets up in the morning saying , ' i 'm really excited to go to the office because there 's free coffee , ' " said @entity136 , author and management columnist			2
" if people feel that the [ cuts ] are being made in a good - faith effort to save jobs , they will be even more loyal than before , since they believe that the company is working on their behalf -- not just for executives			2
" additionally , according to the @entity85 survey , 37 percent of employees have thought of resigning in the last six months			1
twenty - three percent said they thought about leaving because of pay ; 18 percent because of a supervisor or manager ; 15 percent because of career advancement ; and 5 percent because of benefits			2
thirty - nine percent considered it for other reasons			0
" this statistic is especially important because many organizations have cut benefits over the last six months , and it illustrates that the majority of employees have not thought of resigning as a result of adjusted benefits , " @entity84 said			1
" these employees recognize the advantages of sticking around with a company , benefits or not , for advantages such as career development and compensation			1
also , as soon as the economy picks up , many benefits programs will be re-evaluated ; employees sticking around with these organizations will not remain without benefits forever			1
" workers should also remember that there could be consequences to abandoning a job just because you lost free coffee or a transportation reimbursement			0
if you 're thinking about leaving your job for such reasons , make sure that your missing perks outweigh any possible career advancement or opportunities you would receive if you stayed			0
" in this economy , it may be very hard to find another job , and there 's no guarantee that one will have free coffee , either , " @entity136 said			0
" also , at the new job , even if it is good , the employee will have less tenure and is more likely to be cut in future layoffs			0
" if you 've had benefits or perks taken away in recent months and need help staying motivated , remember these five tips from our experts : 1			0
get over it " the longer you talk about it to fellow employees , the longer you will have bad feelings , cause others to have bad feelings and be less productive yourself , which is not what will help the company be able to restore what has been taken away , " said @entity209 , author of " oops ! 13 @entity210 and money ( and what to do instead )			0
find motivation @entity84 encourages employees to find motivation through career planning with supervisors , interacting with co-workers or being proud of where they work			1
for example , an employee could volunteer to act as a sounding board for job candidates considering employment at the organization			1
create your own perks @entity238 , a motivational speaker and author , said employees can take turns bringing in coffee , bagels or potluck lunches to help fill the void of things that have been cut			0
understand what 's still offered and take advantage @entity249 , president and chief creative officer of coach @entity251 , recalls a client who did n't sign up for a course because she thought training costs had been eliminated			1
she realized that a co-worker was taking the course and getting it paid for from tuition reimbursement , an area that had n't been cut			0
" do a deep dive into your company 's programs , policies and even discounts because there 's probably something you can use now , " she said			0
focus on the solution , not the problem concentrate on actions today that will affect your organization 's success and growth tomorrow , said @entity278 , director of human resources at @entity280 , an interactive advertising company			1
" take this time as an opportunity to offer new ideas to your managers and take an active and entrepreneurial role in helping your company overcome straining times			0
if you do a good job , you may be rewarded for your efforts when things improve , " he said			0
" in addition , by taking on new challenges and opportunities , you can further develop your skills and make yourself a more valuable asset to any organization			1
