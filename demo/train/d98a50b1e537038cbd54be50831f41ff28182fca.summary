@entity0 , the first named storm of the @entity10 tropical cyclone season , is churning up the @entity11 and might be at its most dangerous thursday as it grinds up against the @entity15 coast			1
so far , that is the only part of the country predicted to be hit with hurricane force winds , but the weather system also is causing problems farther north			2
officials said wednesday afternoon that the annual @entity22 , normally held on july 4 , will be moved to thursday because of the potential for bad weather			1
@entity0 is expected to become a category 1 hurricane off the @entity15 coast on thursday , and although the eye might not hit land , the storm could create dangerous rip currents that day along the @entity32 and @entity33 , forecasters said			1
@entity15 's governor issued a tropical storm warning for the entire coast and sent this message to those who plan to hit the beaches : stay out of the ocean			2
" i do n't want you to put at risk not only yourself but also people who may try to help you , especially our emergency operation workers , " said gov. @entity41			2

" we 'll just see what happens			0
" when asked whether he was taking any precautions , @entity58 said he planned to fill up the gas tank on his car " just in case			0
" track the storm strong winds could push water to the point where the underwater sandbars in front of @entity15 's beaches break , creating rip currents that would rush swimmers out to sea , @entity50 meteorologist @entity70 said			0

@entity102 is planning to broadcast the pyrotechnics blossoming over the @entity104 live via 20 cameras			0
those wet roads in @entity108 , officials said there 's a chance of rain thursday , so the city 's music - and - fireworks event might not happen that day either , reported @entity50 affiliate @entity114			2

" the rain is a factor for the orchestra , " event organizer @entity118 told the television station			0
" if the rain is coming down hard enough that it is coming down into the @entity123 then it affects the instruments and these instruments are valuable and old			0
" @entity0 could trigger the wrong kinds of bangs and booms on the roads leading up to the @entity92			1
it is the busiest week of summer travel , according to @entity132			0
most of those travelers will be going by car right around the time eastern @entity137 roads will get soaked			0

@entity142 fireworks still a tropical storm wednesday afternoon , @entity0 was slowly creeping north off @entity142 's northern @entity10 coast , dumping rain there , the weather service said			1
the same @entity142 coast might be an ideal place to spend @entity92 , as @entity0 should be far away from there by friday and fireworks will burst over the beaches from @entity152 to @entity153			1
by late saturday , @entity0 will be gone from the @entity137 coast , providing mostly pleasant weekend weather from @entity142 to @entity156			1
