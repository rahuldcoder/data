@entity0 -- @entity3 's government is missing an opportunity to secure the country 's future and build a coalition of nations to counter increasing @entity10 influence , according to analyst @entity11			1
he says the government , headed by prime minister @entity13 , is letting the dispute with the @entity15 over expanded settlements in @entity17 get in the way of making progress toward resolution of the conflict with the @entity22			1
" the @entity13 government goes on and on about the existential threat that @entity3 faces from @entity10 , the need for the world to mobilize , to put that above all else , " @entity11 said			1
" if that really is the case , should n't @entity3 try to be supportive and deepen the relationship with the one country whose military , political and economic support is going to be absolutely crucial in dealing with this threat , that is , the @entity15 ? " if the @entity10 threat were really the overriding threat to @entity3 , would n't it be willing to subordinate other issues and make some progress on the @entity22 issue because it would help the moderate @entity42 states who also share the worries about the rise of @entity10 , and would allow the moderate @entity42 states to form a kind of tacit alliance with @entity3 ? " @entity11 , author and host of @entity1 's " @entity50 , " spoke to @entity1 on wednesday			1
here is an edited transcript : @entity1 : in your view , how badly have @entity15 - @entity3 relations been damaged by the announcement of the @entity17 settlement expansion ? @entity11 : i think by itself this would be a small friction that could easily be overcome , but it comes on the heels of increasingly tense relations between @entity65 and @entity66 , and because of that , it has become larger than life precisely because it seems to be the straw that broke the camel 's back for the @entity74 administration			1
it became a symbol for the fact that in their view , the @entity13 government is simply not trying to be cooperative in the search for some kind of movement forward on the @entity3 - @entity22 issue			1
@entity1 : and why do they feel that way ? @entity11 : they have been trying to get the @entity13 government to do something concrete that would demonstrate that they are interested in moving forward , whether it is direct talks , whether it 's a settlement freeze or any other such signal that would allow the process to begin moving forward rather than to stay where it is			1
so far , the @entity13 government has done nothing like that , and in fact has taken several steps that would make it difficult to enter into direct negotiations			1
... he has within his coalition members of the orthodox right in @entity3 who still very much hold to a view that the jewish state should be on most , if not all , of the land of greater @entity3 , which includes the @entity107			2
... this government has probably been the least responsive to concerns from @entity65 on the issue of the peace process in 20 years			2
@entity1 : the so - called proximity peace talks were delayed as a result of this dispute ? is that a real step backward ? @entity11 : the whole problem with the peace process is that it 's sort of going around in circles			1
i myself think the proximity talks are themselves almost like a bad joke			0
they 're not actually going to talk to one another			0
the @entity15 negotiator is going to shuttle back and forth between them			2
if everyone agrees that there 's going to be a two - state solution and we kind of know what the plan is going to look like , roughly -- which is to say the plan that was largely agreed upon by the two parties in 2000 under the auspices of @entity138 -- we are now going back to the most tentative steps of circling around each other , barely talking to one another			0
it 's as if we 're at the beginning of a negotiating process when really we should be at the end of one ... @entity1 : you 've laid out the obstacles on the @entity3 side			2
are there obstacles on the @entity22 side too ? @entity11 : there are huge obstacles on the @entity22 side : first of all , the divided @entity22 authority -- @entity157 being in charge in @entity159 and the @entity160 in charge on the @entity107			1
there is the reality that @entity157 is still not reconciled to the idea of a jewish state			0
there is the reality of the corruption and perhaps the lack of legitimacy of the @entity160			0
but one would have to say that these problems have existed for a long time , and it 's not clear to me that these problems have gotten worse			0
in fact , the @entity160 is better functioning than it has ever been under @entity176 , the prime minister			0
there is greater control over the territory by the @entity160			0
there is less of a problem of terrorism , a more serious effort to build from the ground up a modern state ... and there have been some very small hints from the @entity157 leadership that they would be willing to accept the state of @entity3			2
it 's not nearly enough , but the point is , if there 's been any movement , it has not been movement backward in the @entity22 case			2
@entity1 : on the @entity3 side , what 's the significance of expanding the settlements in @entity17 ? @entity11 : there are religious parties in @entity3 who want to create facts on the ground [ that ] make it more and more difficult to trade land for peace			1
it 's also an indication that the broader @entity3 public has sort of lost interest in the resolution of the @entity22 problem			1
i think that many see the wall as essentially ending the problem of terrorism			0
the @entity3 public as a whole has moved right and there is a collective belief that @entity3 can simply kick this can down the road and deal with the problem later			2
i think it 's short - sighted , in terms of demographics , regional politics , in terms of the technology of terrorism , pushing this problem away when there will be more palestinians with the potential for being more radicalized , perhaps a greater international coalition arrayed against @entity3			1
it does n't seem to be a far - sighted way to secure @entity3			1
@entity3 is basically succeeding brilliantly in the economic realm ... in many ways , it is even more productive than @entity242 countries			0
it is a technological superstar			0
what it needs is political stability and to resolve this problem so it can move even more dramatically forward			0
but it has a political system where that kind of resolution becomes politically difficult because of many highly reactionary forces within the system			0
@entity1 : is there a way out of this mess ? @entity11 : the way out would be for the @entity3 to recognize that it is profoundly in their long - term interest to resolve this issue , recognize that they are the stronger party ... and see if there is a possibility of some kind of resolution to get out of the terrible bind it 's in			1
it has 3.5 million people on territory it controls who neither have political rights nor a state of their own			0
nor can they be part of @entity3			0
that 's a structural reality which is terrible for the @entity22 but also terrible for the @entity3 because it undermines @entity3 as a democratic state			1
it 's better resolved soon , and whether that means you give up a few hillsides here or there , strikes me as being far less significant than the gain for @entity3 , which would be to once and for all resolve this issue			2
@entity1 : is the @entity13 government in danger of collapsing ? @entity11 : no , i think @entity13 is playing this juggler 's game to keep his coalition together			1
but it 's a far cry from the man who wants to present himself as an international statesman or even an important figure in @entity3 's history			0
... he 's turning out to be a political hack who spends his time counting the votes in the @entity299 rather than thinking about his legacy in the history books			0
... the image is of a churchillian statesman , and the reality is of a local alderman counting the votes .			0

@entity15 - @entity3 relations are at a low *ebb* over @entity17 settlements issue
@entity11 says @entity74 administration is *frustrated* with @entity13 government
he says @entity3 should show it is serious when it says countering @entity10 is its highest priority
@entity11 : progress with @entity22 would facilitate alliance with moderate arabs
