are you tired of seeing the bumbling , clueless , buffoon - like dads in commercials -- the ones whose biggest contribution to child rearing is uttering " @entity9 " as their partners do all the work ? i am and so are countless other men and women			1
and now , it seems , @entity13 is getting the message			2
in sunday 's @entity15 -- which will be seen by more than 100 million people if last year 's telecast is any indication -- a handful of ads will showcase dads as they really are ( what a concept ! ) -- as loving , caring , supportive , helpful and major figures in their children 's lives			1
" it 's about time , " said @entity27 , a father of two in @entity29 , @entity30 , and founder of the blog @entity33			0
one of the brands is @entity36 , which is re-releasing its widely popular ad that debuted last year for @entity38			1
the ad celebrates fathers with vignettes of children of all ages saluting their individual dad by calling him " @entity45 , " " @entity46 " or " @entity33			1
" it will be showcased in a 60 - second spot during the big game			0
( @entity50 is charging around $ 4.5 million for 30 - second commercials , according to @entity52			0
) i tear up every time i watch it			0
" this provides a counter-narrative to all the action hero , buffoon images that we see , " said @entity55 , professor of sociology and gender studies at @entity58 on @entity59			0
he also heads up the school 's @entity65			0
@entity55 was hired by @entity36 as an adviser to help analyze and build on research that the brand conducted last year on how men view masculinity			1
no more dumb old @entity33 : changing the bumbling @entity33 stereotype the study , which involved online surveys with more than 1,000 men in the @entity76 and 2,000 men in the @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 and @entity81 , found that only 7 % of men can relate to the way the media depicts masculinity			1
men today are spending far more time doing housework , helping with childcare and enjoying more egalitarian relationships than any generation in @entity76 history , and their ideas about what it means to be a man have begun to shift as well , said @entity55 , who is also the author of more than 20 books including " manhood in @entity76 : a cultural history			2
" think about it : @entity101 star @entity100 said there is a chance he could miss the @entity15 if his girlfriend goes into labor on @entity106			1
would that have happened years ago ? @entity55 said his father grew up at a time that very much matched the experiences of the character @entity112 in " @entity113			0
" " i grew up thinking my world would look like @entity112 's but it looked nothing like that , " said @entity55			0
" and my son ( age 16 ) ... absolutely knows that his world will not look like that			0
" other brands getting high marks from fathers craving a realistic portrayal of dads today include @entity127 , which released a preview clip of its ad -- its first @entity15 commercial in 18 years			1
the ad appears to showcase a race car driver balancing his high - stakes work with the birth of a child			0
as @entity52 reports , the soundtrack of the ad is @entity140 's immensely popular song " @entity145 , " which is about a father who is too busy at work and ca n't spend much time with his son			0
@entity127 back in @entity15 after 18 years in advance of the airing of the commercial on sunday , @entity127 also has launched a social media campaign at @entity150 , inviting people on @entity152 to submit videos about what fatherhood means to them			1
@entity157 , co-founder of the @entity158 , one of the largest gatherings of parenting writers , dad bloggers and online personalities and now in its fourth year , says brands are increasingly realizing that dads are consumers and caregivers too			1
" it 's no longer a viable thing to try and hook in the moms by sending a collective eye roll at the dads , " said @entity157			2
he remembered how @entity172 , just a few years ago , released an ad showing how fathers were pretty much incapable of staying with their kids for a week while their wives were gone			2
petitions followed , and @entity172 took action , releasing new ads showing dads caring for their children and attending conferences like the @entity158 , said @entity157			1
" we 've seen the needle move from flawlessness in the ' 50s to absolute helplessness in the ' 90s and now we kind of want the needle to come back down the center where it should be , " he said			2
" we 're not @entity192 , but we 're not idiots either , " said @entity157			0
in conversations with dads , mainly through email , about the new ads , including @entity200 's campaign showcasing former football players talking about the role their fathers played in their lives , they applauded the move by brands and talked about the larger impact especially on boys and young men			1
" while football displays one form of entertaining masculinity , it is important for boys to see that masculinity or being ' like a boy ' also includes caregiving , compassion and sacrifice for family , " said @entity210 , a former professor , writer and stay - at - home father of two girls , who is currently working on a memoir about gender and parenting			2
@entity27 , the father of two in @entity29 , said " good positive portrayals " of modern fathers are needed because they are " a legitimate driver of public opinion and attitudes			1
" " when commercials say gay couples are ' ok ' or interracial marriage is ' ok ' or involved fathers are ' ok , ' then people come out of their shell and buy in , " said @entity27			2
" advertising does n't just sell products , it very much shapes public opinion			0
" how to @entity15 # @entity245 @entity246 , a father of three and a radio host , writer and founder of @entity33 and spokesman for the @entity36 + care brand , said there remains a " big gap " between what men see on the screen and how they feel in real life			1
" caring for my family is the most important thing in my life			0
it defines me as a man , " said @entity246 , who said it is " refreshing " to see " a little bit of reality " in @entity15 commercials			1
" our self - worth is wrapped up in the people we love and our ability to care for them			0
it 's the new definition of strength for a men , " he added			2
of course , brands are ultimately driven by profits , and so those that reflect men as they are today stand to earn more than just a feeling of goodwill			1
" people who get it right are going to reap major benefits , " said @entity157 of the @entity158			0
@entity283 , a single father of a 7 - year - old in @entity285 , summed it up this way			2
he 's received some attention from single women who are taken with his involvement in his daughter 's life			0
" it makes sense that advertisers would follow the trend			0
" what do you think about the way dads will be portrayed in some @entity15 ads ? share your thoughts with @entity303 on @entity304 or @entity305 on @entity306 .			1

a handful of brands will be showcasing modern dads in @entity15 ads
fathers *embrace* the move and say the ads could help change *perceptions*
