@entity0 -- republicans led by presidential challenger @entity3 served up a heaping helping of political red meat on friday , launching a salvo of attacks on president @entity8 that called him a liar and a failed leader			1
@entity3 told an interview broadcast on @entity12 that his biggest concern about the three upcoming presidential debates is that @entity8 will be untruthful			1
" the president tends to , how shall i say it , to say things that are n't true , " @entity3 said , contemplating whether he would spend debate time " correcting things that are n't quite accurate " or " talking about the things i want to talk about			1
" in an already nasty and bitter campaign , @entity3 's pre-emptive strike less than three weeks before the first debate on oct. 3 signaled more personal attacks to come as the election campaign gallops toward the november vote			1
@entity8 appears to have maintained a narrow edge in most polls , with a new @entity32 / @entity31 survey released friday giving him a slight 49 % -46 % advantage over the former @entity35 governor			2
while the president 's margin was within the survey 's sampling error , making the result statistically even , the new survey continued a trend reflected in other polls of @entity3 failing to gain ground on the president after the recent political conventions			1
with less than eight weeks until the election , the @entity3 campaign and @entity49 political machine have raised the urgency of their efforts			2
this week , @entity3 took on one of @entity8 's perceived strengths -- his foreign policy record after ending the war in @entity57 and ordering the mission that killed @entity60 leader @entity59 -- by saying a lack of @entity63 leadership has weakened the nation 's influence throughout the world			1
in particular , @entity49 politicians and conservative commentators have cited the killing of @entity63 ambassador @entity70 and three other @entity63 amid anti-american protests in @entity72 this week as an example of the nation 's weakened stature around the world			2
at a ceremony friday to bring home the remains of the slain @entity63 , @entity8 acknowledged the unrest in @entity72 and other @entity81 nations , saying " these are difficult days			1
" " @entity63 will never retreat from the world , " @entity8 declared , vowing that the killers will face justice			2
secretary of state @entity85 also sought to project @entity63 strength and determination , labeling as " senseless " and totally unacceptable " the @entity90 unrest she blamed on an " awful " anti-islam video on the @entity93			0
" the people of @entity97 , @entity72 , @entity98 and @entity99 did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob , " @entity94 told the somber ceremony			0
" reasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts			0
and we will , under the president 's leadership , keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the world			2
" both @entity3 and his running mate -- rep. @entity117 -- mentioned the four slain americans at separate campaign events later friday , asking for a moment of silence after reciting the names of the dead			1
earlier , @entity117 kept up the attacks on @entity8 's foreign policy at a @entity125 in @entity0 hosted by social conservative groups			1
referring to the anti-american protests in the @entity129 world , @entity117 complained that @entity8 has failed to assert @entity63 influence and values that could have brought a different result			1
" the slaughter of brave dissidents in @entity135			0
mobs storming @entity63 embassies and consulates			0
@entity139 four years closer to gaining a nuclear weapon			0
@entity141 , our best ally in the region , treated with indifference bordering on contempt by the @entity8 administration , " @entity117 said			1
" amid all these threats and dangers , what we do not see is steady , consistent @entity63 leadership			0
" calling for " moral clarity and firmness of purpose " in @entity63 foreign policy , he added that " only by the confident exercise of @entity63 influence are evil and violence overcome			0
" as he spoke , three protesters shouting about hiv / aids funding and corporate money were escorted out as the crowd chanted " @entity63			0
" the protesters were from the " @entity170 " group opposed to the @entity167 's @entity166 ruling that permitted unlimited private funding of election campaigns			0
the @entity8 campaign responded to @entity117 's speech with a statement that called it " a series of over-the - top , dishonest attacks " that showed the 42 - year - old congressman was " just not ready for prime time			1
" meanwhile , an array of other speakers at the conservative summit accused @entity8 of weakening the country			2
" it is my belief and my opinion that @entity8 has been the most dangerous president we have ever had on @entity63 foreign policy , " said @entity49 rep. @entity184 of @entity185 , a tea party favorite who ran unsuccessfully for the party 's presidential nomination			1
@entity198 majority leader @entity197 , @entity199 , told the gathering that the upcoming election " is going to determine whether or not the very moral fabric of our country will be upheld or whether it will be torn apart			0
" also friday , a top foreign policy adviser to @entity3 's campaign stood by his argument that this week 's attacks on @entity63 diplomatic posts in @entity72 and @entity97 could have been averted if @entity3 were president			1
@entity210 , a former assistant secretary of state in the @entity212 administration , said @entity3 's policies would have led to a better standing for the @entity63 in the @entity81 countries of recent years			2
" a @entity3 administration would be there , would be more active trying to work with civil society , with reformer movements , so we would be partners in this evolution , not running behind , " @entity210 said on @entity1 's " @entity216			2
" regarding @entity97 , @entity210 cited what he called a lack of @entity63 involvement after the @entity97 protests of 2011 , which ultimately led to the resignation of president @entity228			0
in @entity72 , @entity210 argued , the @entity63 should have been more active in " reconciliation and reconstruction " after a multi-country coalition took military action against @entity72 forces with @entity63 help			0
@entity3 drew criticism for blasting the @entity8 administration on tuesday night -- the 11th anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity63 -- for a statement by the @entity240 in @entity241 that condemned the anti-islam video			1
however , @entity3 's statement inaccurately said the embassy statement -- which came out before protesters invaded the compound -- was in response to the demonstration			2
@entity3 has since toned down his sharpest rhetoric on the matter but kept up the main theme , telling a @entity253 fundraiser on friday that " there have been , over the years , confusing messages sent by the president of the @entity63 to the world			2
" in particular , @entity3 argued that @entity8 " had nothing to say that sent a message to the world " during the 2009 anti-government protests in @entity139 , adding the president should have given direct assistance to the demonstrators			1
at the time , several months into his presidency , @entity8 condemned violence against the @entity139 protesters but not did lead or call for @entity63 involvement in @entity139 's post-election unrest			1
foreign policy was not the only @entity49 focus on friday			0
@entity117 maintained the @entity3 campaign 's criticism of @entity8 's record on economic issues as part of an effort to frame the november vote as a referendum on the president 's performance			1
" after four years of economic stewardship under these self - proclaimed advocates of the poor , and what do they have to show for it ? more people in poverty , and less upward mobility wherever you look , " said the conservative @entity293 chairman from @entity294			0
" after four years of dividing people up with the bogus rhetoric of class warfare , just about every segment of society is worse off			0
" in the @entity12 interview , @entity3 conceded a rare shared stance with @entity8 , saying the two would draw the same " red line " on nuclear weapons in @entity139			1
" my red line is @entity139 may not have a nuclear weapon			0
it is inappropriate for them to have the capacity to terrorize the world , " @entity3 said			0
" @entity139 as a nuclear nation is unacceptable to the @entity63			0
" @entity8 has used almost identical language to describe the situation in @entity139 , and @entity3 said " yes " when asked in the interview if the two candidates would have the same " red line " going forward			1
@entity1 's @entity317 , @entity318 , @entity319 and @entity320 contributed to this report .			0
