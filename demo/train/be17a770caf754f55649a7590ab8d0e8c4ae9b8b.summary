-- it was the soccer foul seen round the world -- a knee to an opponent 's groin			0
it did n't earn a red card and an ejection for @entity10 president @entity9 , but it was caught on video -- and in this viral world of @entity13 , it got him a lot of unwanted attention			0
@entity16 apologized thursday for his intemperate action , saying he had fallen into a trap			1

" the player who kicked me started to insult me and offend me and i very much regret my reaction , " @entity16 said			1
" i ask forgiveness to the sportsmen , to the players , to the player			0
but after kicking me , it was another insult , a reaction			0
" again , i ask for forgiveness			0
sport is integration , but later i realized it was a trap , " @entity16 said			1
@entity43 mayor @entity42 disputed that assertion thursday , assuring that there was no trap , according to the @entity48 news site			1
nor did the player in question insult @entity16 , the mayor is reported to have said			1
" it was simply a soccer game that because of those incidents became a situation that drew much attention , " the news site quotes @entity52 as saying			2
" but i hope there are more soccer games between authorities and institutions to ratify that sports integrate , that it can be beneficial for all citizens			0
" the action unfolded sunday in game between a team put together by @entity16 and a squad of city workers from @entity43 , the capital of @entity10			1

he also said the foul against him was intentional because it happened within two minutes of the game starting			2
he said he went to speak with the referee after he was kicked to ask why he would allow such rough play			0

the president said he has an agreement that when his team plays friendly games against squads from institutions or other agencies , the other side must consist of officials from those places			2
but @entity78 reported that local media said many members of the team that played against @entity16 on sunday -- including @entity112 , the kneed player -- were not government workers and were brought in just for the game			1
and , @entity16 indicated , at least one member of the opposing team was trying to goad him			1
" after that happened , i thought about what a great error it was , " @entity16 said			2
" not so much for the kick he gave me , which he made me feel -- sure there was pain -- but for the insult			0
i complained because his spikes left a mark			0
i think it was the second time			0
but it remains clear that i fell into a trap			2
