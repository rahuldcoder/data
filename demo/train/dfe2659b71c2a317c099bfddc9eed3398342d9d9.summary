-- any kid can dream up a roller coaster			0
but those who visit a new exhibit at @entity7 's @entity6 theme park can actually take a ride on their fantasy creations			1
an artist 's rendering of the " @entity13 " interactive ride , opening wednesday at @entity7			1
@entity6 on wednesday opened a new attraction called " @entity13 , " which lets kids use computer tablets to design a virtual roller coaster , bobsled track or plane ride			1
after inputting their designs , kids climb into a robotic carriage that uses virtual - reality technology to help them experience the ride they 've created			1
" this is really the next generation -- where there 's a lot more personalization involved " in the amusement - park experience , said @entity26 , @entity7 's lead project manager on the ride			2
this make - your - own - ride approach appears to be a growing trend in the world of amusement parks and museums			0
taking cues from the video game industry , park and ride designers have realized that people -- especially young ones -- want to interact with and even design their own thrill rides			1
in addition to the new @entity6 ride in @entity49 , @entity50 , two @entity7 theme parks feature a ride called " @entity52 , " which lets riders shoot at targets as they roll down the track and , in doing so , shape their own ride experience			1
another @entity7 attraction , @entity58 , caters to adults and kids by letting them customize their own virtual ride from a menu of drops , loops and other features			2
@entity66 in @entity50 opened a roller coaster in august called the " @entity68 , " which lets people create their own personal musical soundtrack for their ride			2
interactive rides are in the " baby stages " so far , since roller coasters and theme - park attractions are so expensive to build , but interaction and personalization promise to be running themes in the industry , said @entity80 , president of @entity81 , which has has helped design rides for @entity7 , @entity66 and others			1
@entity84 was not involved in the new ride at @entity6			0
he said theme park designers frequently bring up ideas such as roller coasters with three possible endings , allowing riders to choose which path to take			2
but those big ideas quickly hit a roadblock : the high costs of implementing such a project , he said			0
@entity96 , vice-president of marketing and business development at @entity99 , another amusement - park design firm , said this desire for interactivity in amusement parks takes its cues from video games			0
" there 's also a definite need to compete with video games or the gaming industry -- where [ players ] have control over all of the elements , from the environment to the players ' movement , " he said , noting that museums and zoos also are taking notice of the trend			0
the " @entity13 " ride at @entity6 employs a robotic arm -- more commonly seen assembling cars at an auto plant -- to let kids experience their roller coaster creations			1
sitting in a carriage with their legs and arms outside the ride , kids watch a video version of their ride while the arm moves them from side to side and up and down to simulate the feeling of a real roller coaster			2
fans blow air at the riders at various speeds to give people the sensation that they 're moving forward			0
@entity26 , the @entity7 designer , said the robotic arm and carriage come " pretty darn close " to replicating the real roller coaster experience			2
kids design their experience on touch - screen computers , using a digital ruler and pre-selected track options to construct their rides			1
if a person tries to build something physically impossible -- a hill that 's too steep for the cars to climb , for example -- then they 're asked to retool their ideas			0
@entity7 hopes the interactive nature of the @entity6 ride also helps kids learn that math and science can be fun			1
" i think it 's really empowering for the kids to realize that the math does n't control them			0
they get to control the math , " @entity26 said			0
the @entity168 , a maker of weapons and defense systems , said it sponsored the exhibit as a way to get middle - school aged kids more interested in careers in math and engineering .			0
