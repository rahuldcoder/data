-- in 2010 , the @entity2 , about 3,600 of the majestic predators remain in the wild , their existence threatened by habitat - loss and poaching			1
if there is one man who can give hope to a species whose numbers have plummeted from 100,000 only a century ago , it would be @entity14 prime minister @entity13			1
beginning sunday , @entity13 and the @entity15 will co-host the @entity16 on @entity17 , bringing together the leaders of 13 nations to discuss what could be the best and last chance to save the wild tiger			1
the summit will feature high level officials from every major tiger country , a first in the history of tiger conservation			1
@entity13 , the former @entity28 officer , has a tough political image			1
but in the conservation community , he is first and foremost a champion of the tiger			2
for him this is personal			0
in 2008 he received a female tiger cub as a birthday gift			2
@entity35 spent at least three days sleeping in a wicker basket at @entity13 's home before being given to a zoo			1
the pair met the @entity14 press and images of @entity13 with @entity35 flooded the media			1
in the same year , @entity13 ventured to @entity44 's conservation area where he got between a rampaging tigress and some volunteers			1
after tranquilizing the animal , he helped put a tracking collar on her and she is now featured on his personal website			0
" does she see anything ? " an official asked of the tranquilized tigress			0
" yes , she does			0
and she 'll remember you , " @entity13 joked			2
@entity57 , the head of the @entity60 @entity59 @entity58 said the scale of the summit is " almost solely down to @entity13			1
it is he who is reaching out , turning this from technical meetings into a real political event			0
" " it 's not often that heads of government do get involved to this degree , " said @entity68 of @entity69 , an organization trying to halt illegal trafficking and poaching			0
@entity13 will be joined in @entity89 , @entity14 , by the leaders of the last remaining countries where tigers exist in the wild , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , and @entity88			1
that is less than 7 percent of their historic range			0
" @entity14 is well placed to host the summit			1
they are already a leader in terms of taking steps to try and save their own species			0
the @entity104 tiger is one of few success stories , " @entity68 said			2
@entity14 's far east is now home to roughly 400 @entity104 tigers , accounting for 9 percent of wild tigers in the world			1
and conservation experts agree , the world needs to know that @entity14 's conservation formula -- strict legislation targeting poaching and illegal trade in tiger parts -- can find success elsewhere			1
but @entity14 too must remain vigilant , experts say			2
it has recently come under fire for relaxing patrol efforts against poachers			0
hunters caught with slain , endangered tiger " we know how to save tigers			2
what we do n't know how to do is keep the political will and financial support going			0
we can get a large scale reaction when a population is at the brink , but when recovery starts the pressure comes off , " said the @entity60 's @entity57			2
@entity80 , too , has had some success in recovering wild tiger populations			1
a recent @entity69 report credits @entity80 with the most seizures of illegal tiger parts in the past decade , representing up to 533 animals poached , but numbers are increasing			0
" in @entity14 and also southwest @entity80 we have seen that with a clear focused effort there is solid evidence of tiger numbers going up , " said @entity143 , president of the @entity144			1
but the tiger country with the richest economy , @entity79 , still fuels the market for tiger parts despite government efforts to curb the trade , experts say			0
in 1993 the @entity157 government banned domestic trade in tiger bone			0
and tiger - based remedies have officially been taken out of medicine books			2
but devotees of traditional medicine linger , and demand has grown to include an array of tiger - based luxury products for @entity79 's elite			2
@entity69 's @entity169 suggests that a lack of dedication from high level officials means that @entity79 is still a prime destination for poachers trying to make a quick profit			0
in poorer nations like @entity81 and @entity85 , sparse resources outweigh political will , experts say			0
" these countries may have the will but not the means to put the boots on the ground			0
poachers drive around in suvs with advanced satellite equipment and often police have to catch a bus , " @entity68 said			0
conservation officials are hoping for remedies to emerge at @entity13 's four - day summit			1
if not , experts say , the wild tiger will be extinct by the next @entity2 in 2022 , and that wo n't bode well for wildlife overall , said @entity57			1
" if we ca n't rally to save the world 's most iconic animal , how are we going to save the rest of the planet ? "			0
