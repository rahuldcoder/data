-- when it comes to health care , @entity1 disagree about much , but we do agree that our $ 2.7 - trillion - a - year health care system is broken			1
although fixing the system will be difficult , there is one inexpensive , readily available , and highly effective way to prevent illness while drastically reducing skyrocketing health care costs : let 's help each other exercise more			1
in fact , it 's what we evolved to do			2
the essential role of physical activity in promoting health has deep evolutionary roots			1
prior to a few hundred generations ago , our ancestors were hunter - gatherers who trekked at least five miles every day as well as ran , dug , climbed , and did all their work by hand			2
although the origin of agriculture transformed our diets , farmers also had to toil long , hard hours			0
until recently , all of us were athletes			0
today , most @entity1 seldom , if ever , have to do much physical work			1
cars , elevators , escalators , shopping carts , and other labor - saving innovations allow us to exist for days without ever significantly elevating our heart rates or breaking a sweat			0
few jobs require physical activity and most of us have little inclination to exercise in our spare time			1
as a result , a majority of @entity1 fail to meet the @entity46 's recommendation to exercise at least 150 minutes per week			1
being physically inactive is not only abnormal , it is also pathological , because the old adage " use it or lose it " is really true			0
our bodies evolved to require the stresses inherent in physical activity to grow and function properly , and our bodies never evolved to cope with persistent inactivity			0
@entity58 exercise is vital for developing a strong and healthy circulatory system , durable bones safe from osteoporosis , a vigorous immune system , a properly functioning brain and more			1
almost every organ and body system benefits from regular exercise and is compromised by its absence			1
how to fix health problems with exercise no health problem illustrates the benefits of exercise more acutely than heart disease , which afflicts more than 15 million @entity1 and is our nation 's leading cause of death			1
yet of all the diseases we face , heart disease is one of the most preventable and treatable through exercise			1
men who are unfit but then improve their fitness lower their rate of death from heart disease by about 50 % , research shows			0
because treating a patient with heart disease costs more than $ 20,000 extra per year , we could save almost $ 40 billion a year by getting just 25 % more @entity1 to exercise moderately			1
those savings are actually a big underestimate , since studies show physical activity also substantially reduces the prevalence and severity of many other costly diseases , including @entity99 , breast cancer and colon cancer			0
to be sure , exercise is not a panacea			1
regular physical activity does not guarantee good health , and it has only limited effects on weight loss			2
yet , even though exercise wo n't solve the obesity epidemic , it confers so many health benefits regardless of one 's weight , the question we should ask is not whether more @entity1 should exercise , but how can we help them do it ? again , the human body 's evolutionary story provides useful answers			1
we evolved to be physically active not because we wanted to but because we were obliged to			0
our @entity121 ancestors who struggled to survive had no alternative to being active for many hours a day , but they also benefited from taking it easy whenever possible to avoid wasting scarce energy			0
even though cars , elevators and shopping carts are recent inventions , the instincts to use them are ancient and powerful			0
as a result , we need motivation to exercise			2
would you like 2 hours of exercise with that ? how can we help each other exercise ? in the case of children , exercise needs to be fun , playful , and as much a daily priority as brushing one 's teeth and getting enough sleep			2
it also needs to be mandatory			0
just as we mandate car seats for children and prohibit minors from purchasing alcohol and tobacco , we need to implement regular , meaningful levels of fitness - based physical activity in school			0
by failing to do so adequately , we are robbing millions of children of healthy futures , and we are guaranteeing enormous future medical bills			0
what about adults ? although adults have the right to be inactive , most of us wish otherwise but we require nudges from friends , families , health care providers , businesses , and other social institutions , including government			2
on the local level , we need communities to promote non-motorized transportation and to encourage fitness activities like walking , cycling , jogging , and soccer			0
businesses , both large and small , need financial incentives to encourage employees to exercise and to build the infrastructure necessary for people to do so safely and conveniently			2
doctors , health care providers , and insurers should be rewarded for helping patients become more active			2
in short , promoting fitness has to become a collective responsibility			0
can we do this ? if history is any guide , the answer is yes			0
through collective action over the last 50 years , we decreased by 50 % the number of @entity1 who smoke , as well as the number of @entity1 who die in motor vehicle accidents			1
have you quit smoking ? share your story finally , can we afford not to become more active ? because of many advances , @entity1 no longer need to be physically active to survive on a day - to - day basis , but our @entity121 bodies still require exercise to thrive as we age			1
for the sake of our bodies , our economy , and our country , the consequences of inaction are too great to accept			0
why @entity1 are dying earlier than their international peers see @entity209 and dr. @entity210 show how anyone can run faster and longer with less effort on " @entity213 , " saturday at 4:30 p.m. and sunday at 7:30 a.m.			1

exercising for health has deep evolutionary roots
most @entity1 do n't exercise enough
we should help each other exercise more often , *authors* say
