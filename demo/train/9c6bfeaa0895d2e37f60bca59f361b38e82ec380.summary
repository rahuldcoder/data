-- in the @entity2 , it 's easier than ever to steal and publish data			1
corporations and governments have to adjust to their secrets being exposed , regularly			1
when massive amounts of government documents are leaked , journalists sift through them to determine which pieces of information are newsworthy , and confer with government agencies over what needs to be redacted			1
managing this reality is going to require that governments actively engage with members of the press who receive leaked secrets , helping them secure those secrets -- even while being unable to prevent them from publishing			1
it might seem abhorrent to help those who are seeking to bring your secrets to light , but it 's the best way to ensure that the things that truly need to be secret remain secret , even as everything else becomes public			1
the @entity32 cables serve as an excellent example of how a government should not deal with massive leaks of classified information			1
@entity32 has said it asked @entity38 authorities for help in determining what should be redacted before publication of documents , although some government officials have challenged that statement			2
@entity32 ' media partners did redact many documents , but eventually all 250,000 unredacted cables were released to the world as a result of a mistake			1
the damage was nowhere near as serious as government officials initially claimed , but it had been avoidable			2
fast - forward to today , and we have an even bigger trove of classified documents			1
what @entity57 took -- " exfiltrated " is the @entity60 term -- dwarfs the @entity62 cables , and contains considerably more important secrets			1
but again , the @entity38 government is doing nothing to prevent a massive data dump			1
the government engages with the press on individual stories			2
the @entity69 , the @entity70 , and the @entity71 are all redacting the original @entity57 documents based on discussions with the government			2
the @entity38 press regularly consults with the government before publishing something that might be damaging			2
in 2006 , the @entity71 consulted with both the @entity60 and the @entity78 administration before publishing @entity79 's whistle - blowing about the @entity60 's eavesdropping on @entity82 trunk circuits			1
in all these cases , the goal is to minimize actual harm to @entity38 security while ensuring the press can still report stories in the public interest , even if the government does n't want it to			1
in today 's world of reduced secrecy , whistle - blowing as civil disobedience , and massive document exfiltrations , negotiations over individual stories are n't enough			1
the government needs to develop a protocol to actively help news organizations expose their secrets safely and responsibly			1
here 's what should have happened as soon as @entity57 's whistle - blowing became public			1
the government should have told the reporters and publications with the classified documents something like this : " ok , you have them			2
we know that we ca n't undo the leak			0
but please let us help			0
let us help you secure the documents as you write your stories , and securely dispose of the documents when you 're done			0
" the people who have access to the @entity57 documents say they do n't want them to be made public in their raw form or to get in the hands of rival governments			1
but accidents happen , and reporters are not trained in military secrecy practices			0
copies of some of the @entity57 documents are being circulated to journalists and others			0
with each copy , each person , each day , there 's a greater chance that , once again , someone will make a mistake and some -- or all -- of the raw documents will appear on the @entity136			1
a formal system of working with whistle - blowers could prevent that			0
i 'm sure the suggestion sounds odious to a government that is actively engaging in a war on whistle - blowers , and that views @entity57 as a criminal and the reporters writing these stories as " helping the terrorists			0
" but it makes sense			0
@entity153 law professor @entity152 compares this to plea bargaining			1
the police regularly negotiate lenient sentences or probation for confessed criminals in order to convict more important criminals			2
they make deals with all sorts of unsavory people , giving them benefits they do n't deserve , because the result is a greater good			0
in the @entity57 case , an agreement would safeguard the most important of @entity60 's secrets from other nations ' intelligence agencies			1
it would help ensure that the truly secret information not be exposed			0
it would protect @entity38 interests			0
why would reporters agree to this ? two reasons			0
one , they actually do want these documents secured while they look for stories to publish			0
and two , it would be a public demonstration of that desire			0
why would n't the government just collect all the documents under the pretense of securing them and then delete them ? for the same reason they do n't renege on plea bargains : no one would trust them next time			2
and , of course , because smart reporters will probably keep encrypted backups under their own control			0
we 're nowhere near the point where this system could be put into practice , but it 's worth thinking about how it could work			2
the government would need to establish a semi-independent group , called , say , a @entity210 unit , which could act as an intermediary			0
since it would be isolated from the agencies that were the source of the leak , its officials would be less vested and -- this is important -- less angry over the leak			0
over time , it would build a reputation , develop protocols that reporters could rely on			0
leaks will be more common in the future , but they 'll still be rare			2
expecting each agency to develop expertise in this process is unrealistic			0
if there were sufficient trust between the press and the government , this could work			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity236 .			1

@entity236 : in today 's world , massive leaks of secrets should be expected
it may seem odd , but governments should negotiate with leakers , he says
@entity236 : it 's in everyone 's interest to avoid *unnecessary* *disclosure* of secrets
governments could negotiate what amounts to a plea bargain
