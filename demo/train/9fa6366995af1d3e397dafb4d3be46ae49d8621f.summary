-- there will be less boobs at next year 's @entity3			1
@entity4 , whose irreverent hosting performance at the @entity6 was controversial but a ratings hit , announced today that he would n't be taking the stage again next year			2
" traumatized critics exhale : i 'm unable to do the @entity3 again			1
tried to make it work schedule-wise , but i need sleep , " he tweeted monday afternoon			1
" however , i highly recommend the job , as @entity15 and @entity16 are two of the most talented producers in the business			0
my suggestion for host is @entity21			1
" @entity22 is currently directing and appearing in " @entity23 , " a stud - studded @entity24 headlined by @entity26 and @entity27			0
@entity22 's withdrawal will likely appease some members of the @entity31 community who did n't appreciate his humor â € ” which drew criticism that his jokes ranged from juvenile to misogynistic			1
but despite the tsk - tsking by some , ratings for the show were up significantly , including an 11 percent jump in the demo			0
@entity21 is likely not in the mix to succeed @entity22 ( unfortunately ) , but the @entity45 is now free to go in a different direction			0
perhaps they could appease some of last year 's critics with a female host ... or two			2
