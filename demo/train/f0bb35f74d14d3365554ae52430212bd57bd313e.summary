-- when was the last time you looked at the label on your clothes to check where they were made or what they are made of ? a few years ago , i was living a paradox familiar to many @entity11 : eating local and organic food , carrying reusable bags to the grocery store and choosing eco-friendly products wherever i could			1
this mindfulness was in no way extended to my closet -- i owned more than 350 items of clothes , every single bit of it cheap , trendy , poorly made and assembled in low - wage factories in other countries			0
see the lifecycle of your cotton t - shirt fashion today has a here - today - gone - tomorrow mentality , where the latest look , lowest price or the hottest designer are paramount and quantity is valued over quality			1
for the first time in history , we are consuming clothes as a disposable good , buying a cheap dress for a date night and wearing it but once or twice			0
these changing attitudes prompted me to write my book , " overdressed : the @entity45 , " and what i learned about the fashion industry during the process compelled me to change			1
complete coverage : @entity50 our consumption of clothing is growing at an alarming rate			0
most @entity11 have closets brimming , if not overflowing with clothes			1
few of those purchases are made here -- 3 % of apparel is produced in the @entity11 , down from about half in 1990			1
while @entity11 factories sit empty , our thirst for cheap imported clothing has kept the cash registers at many stores humming throughout the recession			1
fashion 's environmental footprint has also mushroomed			1
there are more than 80 billion garments produced around the world today , and according to a study by the @entity75 's @entity74 , the industry is creating 70 million tons of waste water as of 2006 in the @entity75 alone			1
in @entity80 , the largest clothing manufacturer in the world , the textile industry is also a major polluter			2
last year , i traveled undercover to southern @entity80 and saw smog enshrouding a landscape of factories and , more shockingly , hundreds of factory workers wearing cheap , trendy clothes			2
as @entity80 's consumer class grows , already - scarce resources like water and petroleum may soon buckle under all of this shopping			1
in july , when it came out that the @entity96 uniforms were made in @entity80 , @entity11 were outraged , making it clear that we 're growing weary of soulless consumption			1
i believe we 're ready for more meaningful wardrobes , and to support our amazing clothing heritage			0
my mother recently gave me a dress that she wore in high school in the 1960s			0
it was made by @entity107 , a juniors brand that was considered cheap for its day -- the dress is 100 % wool , fully lined , finished with @entity110 seams and made in the @entity11			1
what 's so wonderful about locally made fashion is that it offers designers tight control over their product , has a lower environmental footprint and makes it easier to keep an eye on any labor problems			2
and according to a @entity123 survey , approximately 55 % of consumers agree it is " very / somewhat important " that their clothing is made in the @entity11 i was recently in @entity126 , @entity127 , and met with the owners of @entity129 and the @entity130 , two small shops that have opened recently in a city that had very little existing garment industry infrastructure			1
they were able to build profitable manufacturing businesses from scratch			0
just imagine what other @entity11 cities could do with the right government and consumer support			1
major fashion brands also have an obligation to dramatically reduce the amount of water and energy used and waste emitted in making and selling their clothes , as well as to offer consumers more stylish products that are made out of recycled and eco-friendly materials			1
@entity152 is creating athletic team uniforms out of recycled pet bottles and has recycled more than 28 million pairs of athletic shoes through their @entity157 ; @entity158 has just released a beautiful line of bluesign - certified silk shirts dyed without hazardous chemicals ; and @entity162 has agreed to stop using toxic and nonbiodegradable perfluorinated compounds , called @entity164 , in their outerwear by 2013			0
these efforts need to be expanded			0
clothing designers also need to rethink the materials they 're using and how they 're sourced			0
fortunately , eco-friendly textiles have improved so much in recent years that luxurious eco-friendly fibers like @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173 have far more in common with silk than a hemp sack			0
some emerging designers are eschewing new textiles altogether for upcycling , which means taking waste and reclaimed textile material and turning it into a product with higher value			2
i recently bought a lovely red tunic upcycled from a men 's dress shirt produced by a small @entity188 designer called @entity189			2
designer on the rise : @entity193 's moment according to the @entity195 , we are throwing away 68 pounds of textiles per person per year and donating such a staggering volume of clothes that a majority of our donations to charity have to be sold to textile recyclers who then sell more than half of our used clothes overseas , largely to @entity207			2
retailers like @entity158 and @entity209 are accepting returns of their worn products -- @entity212 resells them in her @entity215 retail store , while @entity209 recycles theirs into new products			0
fast - fashion stores need to start these types of recycling programs			2
consumers can also take more responsibility by repairing and caring for the clothes they own , trading their duds at clothing swaps and , for the particularly creative , refashioning last year 's styles into fresh looks			2
now for the million - dollar question : how can you afford this ? it all starts by taking an honest look at how you 're spending money on clothes			0
the average @entity11 consumer spends $ 1,700 a year on apparel			1
most of us own more clothing than we know what to do with , so i encourage people to first of all buy less clothing and to try to limit trendy , throwaway purchases to only one or two a season			0
divert the rest of your clothing budget to clothes that you truly love and are going to wear for several seasons			0
if just a quarter of our purchases were put toward locally made or eco-friendly fashion and fashion companies with a commitment to sustainability , we could change the face of the industry			2
i also believe we 'd be happier with our clothes			0
see what a cotton t - shirt goes through before it gets to you			0
