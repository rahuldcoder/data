in order to understand the turbulent world of @entity4 politics , you have to start with one name : @entity6			1
the former prime minister has dominated the country 's political scene for more than a decade despite going into exile after his ouster in a 2006 coup			1
back in 2010 , deadly clashes took place between security forces and @entity6 supporters who had occupied central @entity17			1
they were demanding his return			0
now , his sister is in power and she recently tried to pass an amnesty law that could have allowed his return			1
the attempt failed , but it provided fuel for the current protests shaking the capital			0
here 's a quick primer to make sense of it all			2
who is @entity6 ? he 's a deeply polarizing figure -- a billionaire telecommunications mogul who built his political power on policies popular with @entity4 's rural villagers			1
his success ruffled a lot of feathers among the country 's established elites , and critics accused him of corruption and autocratic rule			1
he was prime minister between 2001 and 2006 , when the military deposed him in a bloodless coup			1
what happened in 2010 ? @entity6 's ouster spurred the protest movement that developed over the years into the widespread " red shirt " demonstrations that occupied upscale parts of @entity17 in 2010			1
by that stage , the movement had broadened to represent other issues , including resentment at the military 's involvement in politics and economic inequality			2
the crackdown by security forces on the red shirts resulted in clashes that left around 90 people dead			0
it has been described as the worst civil violence in @entity4 's history , and the country remains severely scarred by the experience			2
could the current protests lead to a repeat ? the situation is different this time			0
those protesting are opponents of @entity6 rather than his supporters			1
his sister , @entity77 , is now prime minister			1
her government is under pressure after widespread anger over its recent failed attempt to pass a bill that could have granted amnesty to @entity6 and others			1
although the public has generally moved on from the conflict over the amnesty bill , the opposition @entity85 is trying to use the issue to bring down @entity77 's government , says @entity91 , director of the @entity17 - based risk assessment firm @entity92			1
" the government is facing probably a countdown until it will have to dissolve and hold new elections , " @entity91 says			0
" but it does n't look like it 's a replay of 2010 when we 're going to see violence in the streets and an extended takeover of central @entity17			1
what has @entity6 been up to ? he has been living in exile in a number of different places , most recently @entity105 , while continuing to play an active role in @entity4 politics			1
he briefly returned to @entity4 in 2008			0
later that year , he was convicted by a @entity4 court of corruption and sentenced in absentia to two years in prison over a controversial land deal			0
courts have also frozen billions of dollars of his assets , but he is believed to still have a great deal of money held elsewhere			0
he 's also stayed heavily involved in @entity4 politics over the years , communicating with supporters via social media and video messages			2
with his younger sister in power since 2011 , his influence remains strong			2
critics say @entity77 is @entity6 's puppet , but she insists she has always been independent			1
what is happening this week ? after weeks of demonstrations , thousands of protesters have gathered around government buildings in central @entity17 , occupying some of them for varying periods of time			2
@entity77 has expanded the area in and around @entity17 covered by an internal security law that gives police extra powers to disband protesters			2
in parliament , the prime minister is facing a " no confidence " motion against her			1
and police have issued an arrest warrant against protest leader , @entity144			0
for most of @entity17 , business as usual despite protests 6			0
what 's at stake for the region ? the demonstrations are bringing instability once again to @entity4 , a key regional economy and popular tourist destination			2
the protests are centered on @entity17 , a vital transportation hub , especially for air travel			0
so far , the protests are concentrated in specific parts of the city			0
more than a dozen countries have issued travel warnings for citizens to avoid areas near protests in @entity17			0
what do the demonstrators want ? @entity144 , a former deputy prime minister under the previous @entity168 - led government , has said the demonstrations " will not stop until @entity6 's regime is wiped out			1
" such an aim seems ambitious			0
@entity77 's government was democratically elected and her @entity173 retains support in its core areas			2
the current protests have echoes of 2008 when demonstrators opposed to a @entity180 government occupied @entity17 's main airport and government offices			2
where are the protesters getting their support from ? opposition to @entity6 and @entity77 is strongest among the urban elites and middle class			1
" @entity17 is the ground zero for @entity193 protest movements , " @entity91 says			0
" the rest of the country , other than southern @entity4 , is either in his camp or sort of politically neutral			0
" that 's why the recent demonstrations have been concentrated in the streets of the capital			1
what 's the government 's support base ? @entity6 's traditional support comes from the populous rural areas of north and northeast of @entity4			1
the government 's botched amnesty move may have hurt its standing in those areas , but not fatally			1
" despite the pictures of thousands of people in the street that does n't necessarily mean the government will go -- or if it does go , that it will lose the next election , " @entity91 says			0
what is likely to happen next ? questions remain over the ability of @entity77 's government to maintain order in the capital and weather the heavy political pressure in @entity224			0
some observers are concerned that government supporters , tens of thousands of whom rallied in @entity17 on sunday , could clash with opposition demonstrators			0
@entity77 has said authorities would " absolutely not use violence " to disperse the demonstrators			0
even if @entity77 survives the " no confidence " motion against her , the situation appears unlikely to calm down soon			0
" we 're going to see political instability here for some time , " @entity91 says .			0

at the heart of the *unrest* is the polarizing figure of @entity6
his sister is now prime minister , and critics say she 's his puppet
a recent move to grant amnesty to @entity6 and others caused anger
protesters say they wo n't stop until " @entity6 's regime is wiped out "
