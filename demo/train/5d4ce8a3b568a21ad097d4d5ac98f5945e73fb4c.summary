@entity0 -- at the @entity5 @entity4 strategy session in january , i stood before the @entity6 and said , " i am your worst nightmare			1
" it was a figure of speech , of course , but my point was that our campaign helped change the political equation for winning elections			2
no longer is it enough to have big - name identification and big money to win			2
we demonstrated that principles and policy matter , and if you combine that with hard work and dynamic new media , young upstarts can beat incumbents in a big way			1
( i beat a 12 - year incumbent in my own party , winning by 20 points			2
) in order to survive in the current political climate , it 's paramount to be on the cutting edge of technical trends			2
as a young freshman , it is challenging to distinguish myself among 434 other members			2
if i want to be relevant and productive , i have to work hard to get my message across			1
using social media is a great way to do just that			1
i stay in contact with people through @entity45 , @entity46 and @entity47			2
other members of @entity49 have also jumped aboard the @entity50			2
these days , even @entity51 is all - a - twitter over new social media			1
see the latest episode of " @entity54 " granted , my " tweets " will not replace town hall meetings or direct mail , but social media is an important outreach supplement			1
people like feeling connected to their elected officials			0
residents of my district want their voices to be heard and want to be a part of the political process			0
it has been very important to me that my constituents do n't have to wade through layers of bureaucracy to reach me			1
my @entity45 page , for example , hosts hundreds of interactions each week from " supporters			0
" i post frequently and engage in the comments			0
i never outsource this type of communication to staff			0
it 's done entirely by me			0
that kind of attention builds trust with people			0
they know what i really think , and they develop a connection with me -- even if we disagree			0
@entity46 has become a particularly useful tool for me			0
i often tweet several times a day			0
followers get an inside look at not only my job , but also my personality -- and sometimes my appetite			0
when i came to @entity0 as a newly elected member of @entity49 , i got a few headlines for bringing a cot to sleep on in my office			0
taking my inspiration from @entity101 's @entity100 in the 1930s and ' 40s , i began producing " @entity103 " that are featured on my web site			0
these chats give me the opportunity to talk directly with my constituents about the issues i think are important			1
social media is a two - way street			1
it 's a great way to deliver a message , and it 's free			1
it also provides me with opportunities to listen to what is going on in the real world in real time			0
with today 's easy internet access and the surging popularity of social networking , there 's no excuse for politicians to remain in the 20th century			1
for me , embracing new media and increasing the accessibility for my constituents is a winning formula			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity130 .			1
