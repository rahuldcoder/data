ex-college football player @entity15 clings to an overturned boat monday in this @entity6 photo			1
and such incidents happen all too often			0
the capsizing of the 21 - foot fishing boat carrying the four men to a favorite fishing spot in the @entity23 was the latest of 200 such incidents reported to the @entity6 in the past five months			1
" the oceans are an unforgiving environment , " said @entity6 lt. cmdr			2
" weather can be unpredictable			0
any time you are in an open environment , you are taking a certain amount of risk			0
" that risk includes being lost at sea like @entity36 , an @entity37 linebacker ; @entity38 , a @entity40 free - agent defensive end ; and their friend @entity41			0
the fourth member of the group , @entity15 , a former @entity44 football player , was found around noon monday clinging to the upturned boat in rough seas about 35 miles west of @entity47 , @entity14			2
the four men had left for a fishing trip from @entity49 in @entity50 on saturday			0
the @entity6 is unable to provide specific numbers of how many people go missing from boating accidents like this past weekend 's , but officials say that since last fall there have been three people who have not been found after triggering @entity6 searches			1
those incidents can range from an unaccounted swimmer to a passenger gone missing after a boat sinks , said @entity27 , at the @entity6 headquarters in @entity63 capsizing is one of the leading boating accidents , according to the @entity6 's most recent report on recreational boating in 2007			1
officials report there were 398 accidents from capsizing , causing 204 deaths and 284 injuries in 2007			1
capsized boats cost nearly $ 1.8 million a year in property damages , officials say			1
collision with vessels or fixed objects and falling overboard are other major boating accidents			0
last weekend , @entity14 state officials recovered the bodies of a 48 - year - old man and his 7 - year - old granddaughter after their 15 - foot bass tipped over in @entity85 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity86 in @entity87 , @entity14			2

to remain safe on any body of water , @entity6 officials stress having the proper safety equipment and being wary of changes in the weather			1
the @entity11 players ' boat capsized off @entity14 in waves up to 10 feet high while being buffeted by winds up to 45 miles per hour , @entity6 officials said			1
they reported 110 cases since this fall where a boat has been beset by weather			0
boaters should wear a life jacket at all times , officials say , because an accident can occur so quickly that passengers may not have time to put their life jackets on			2
a life jacket that is bright or has deflecting tape to help catch the eyes of rescuers is recommended			0
boaters should also keep a bag with flotation and communication devices , officials said			1
the @entity6 encourages boaters to purchase @entity122 ( @entity123 ) that can cost between $ 200 to $ 1,500			1
this technology enables emergency signals to be sent out automatically or manually when a boat sinks			2
some @entity127 have global positioning devices that can help provide the rescuers with a more exact location			2
after a boat capsizes , passengers should always stay near the vessel to make it easier for rescuers to find them , especially in waves and high winds			2
whitecaps on waves can also confuse @entity6 searches			2
@entity15 , who was rescued on monday , was easier to find because he was near the boat , @entity6 officials say			1
@entity142 says he and six of his friends were in a similar situation in 1993 when their boat capsized during a spear fishing trip in @entity148 in @entity14 , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity149 in @entity150			0
the group was stranded for 18 hours before being rescued by a helicopter			0
" we all had to cling on to the hull of the boat for the whole time until we were finally rescued , " @entity142 said			0
" you never leave the largest object in the water , " he said			0
" i mean that 's what you stick with			0
" sticking with the overturned vessel also helps the @entity6 use advanced computer technology to find it , officials said			1
called @entity166 , or @entity167 , the program takes into account external conditions such as weather , ocean patterns and information available about the case such as which dock the boaters departed from to map locations in the ocean where officers can search			2
the program , which has been used by the @entity6 's @entity181 for nearly two years , helps officers narrow down the location , especially critical during the beginning of a search , said petty officer @entity186 of the @entity187			1
for the program to work best , @entity6 officials say , boaters need to be sure to tell people where are they leaving from and their final destination			1
even with the technology , a sea rescue is no easy feat , @entity186 said			0
" it 's very difficult to locate someone ...			0
it 's like trying to find a basketball in the ocean			1
