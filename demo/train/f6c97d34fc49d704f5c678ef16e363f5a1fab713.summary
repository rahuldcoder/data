while reporting in @entity1 in november 2011 , i came across a black flag fluttering atop @entity4 's courthouse			1
the flag was imprinted with a yellow moon and the @entity8 declaration of belief , " there is no god but @entity12 , and @entity13 is the messenger of @entity12 , " a design used by some extremist groups , namely @entity15 , to represent @entity8 culture in the status of war ( i.e. @entity19 )			2
i quickly took some photographs and sent the images to vice			0
an article was posted later that day and drew a fiery response from some corners of the media world , questioning my findings and accusing me of doctoring the photos to serve a hidden agenda			1
to prove what i 'd seen , i paired up with @entity30 , an @entity31 cameraman , and together we began our investigation into extremism in @entity35			1
it would be unfair , however , to claim that the black flag had been the only sign that radical figures were angling for a seat of power in the new @entity1			2
at the capitol , a high - ranking member of the now - defunct @entity43 , @entity44 , had been appointed the leader of the @entity47			0
in the early days of the @entity48 , the @entity43 had declared their support for @entity15 and had been reported to share forces with the group for several years			2
@entity44 , after a stint in the @entity31 's rendition program and @entity55 's @entity54 , now sits in a miniature throne of power within the @entity58 and is running as leader of his own political party in the upcoming elections			1
see the rest of @entity63 at @entity64			0
over in @entity1 , where we traveled to meet a group of weapons makers and the @entity8 cleric @entity69 , there are concerns that large numbers of the weapons used in the revolution are now being sold to extremist groups like the @entity76 fighters of @entity77 and @entity15 in @entity78			0
and since @entity1 is traditionally known as the more radical region of the country , it 's feared that powerful religious leaders like mr. @entity69 are encouraging fundamentalist religious groups to take root in these sparsely regulated lands			0
our dealings with many of these characters did n't conjure up a nest of card - carrying @entity15 operatives , but they did confirm that @entity1 has made itself very vulnerable by not filling the power vacuum created by @entity55 's ouster			1
if their transitional government does n't become a functioning government soon , @entity1 may indeed be waiting for @entity15 .			0

after @entity55 's ouster , vice **correspondent** spots black flag of @entity15 in @entity4
**correspondent** snaps photos that draw fiery response *fom* those questioning his findings
