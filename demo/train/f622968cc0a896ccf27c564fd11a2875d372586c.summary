@entity0 -- @entity2 2008 shows where @entity3 has been			1
the @entity5 have played at home every @entity2 since 1934			1
it is the city 's greatest football tradition			2
yet instead of a source of great pride , the game had become an embarrassment , as well as representative of everything going horribly wrong in @entity0			2
the auto industry melted down with alarming and unprecedented speed			2
the @entity17 of @entity0 was rife with political scandal that eventually put mayor @entity19 and several other prominent public officials behind bars			2
all this turmoil came while the @entity5 were poised to be the only team in @entity25 history to go 0 - 16			1
the sentiment ? the @entity5 were viewed as incredible losers in the @entity25 landscape , so we must be incredible losers , too			1
however , the fans maintained their love for the team in spite of their obvious difficulties			2
the @entity35 ended up thrashing the @entity5 , 47 - 10			1
@entity35 's defensive coordinator that day was @entity37			0
less than two months later , he was the @entity5 ' head coach			1
" i do n't remember much about the game other than we had our concerns about winning it , but i do recall the drive into the city			1
" you could just see and feel what was happening at the time			0
it was eye - opening			0
" that was in stark contrast to what is happening in @entity0 three years later			0
in 2011 , the @entity5 are 4 - 0 for the first time since 1980			1
their matchup monday night against @entity54 at @entity55 is perhaps the most anticipated football game the @entity5 have played since they advanced to the @entity58 championship game in 1991			1
meanwhile on the mound in @entity0 , the @entity59 are also showing amazing promise			1
in a thrilling game , the @entity59 beat the @entity63 3 - 2 on thursday to advance to the @entity64			1
the @entity59 did capture the @entity66 pennant in 2006 -- eliminating the @entity63 -- but had been a high - payroll , low - achieving club since until this summer , when they ran away with the @entity71 title			1
the pressure to deliver the division title this season was so intense that on the night the @entity59 clinched , tears welled in manager @entity77 's eyes as he was interviewed by @entity3 team broadcaster @entity78			1
" at times like this , sports teams can lift the spirits of their fans , " @entity77 said , his voice cracking			0
" i hope we uplifted their spirits , because they deserved it			0
" at this moment in @entity0 , it seems like both teams , the @entity5 and @entity59 , are lifting each other 's as well as this city 's spirits			1
" we 're all allies , " @entity77 said			0
" we 're pulling for one and another			0
good atmosphere for the city			2
makes people forget about their troubles with good times with sports			2
" the success of the @entity5 and @entity59 has hardly made the city 's problems go away.the 2010 census numbers revealed that @entity0 's population dropped to 713,777			1
@entity3 had once been the nation 's fourth largest city , with more than 1.8 million people			1
@entity109 was the only state in the nation to have a net loss in population since the 2000 census			2
there are entire blocks of @entity0 that are nothing but vacant houses			0
violence is also a major issue			0
in one 24 - hour period on an august weekend , 16 people were shot and seven killed			2
yet there are some signs of hope in the economy			0
the auto industry seems to be doing better			0
@entity130 stock is up nearly 11 times its value at the depths of the meltdown , while @entity134 is trading publicly again and reporting profits			0
@entity136 is reportedly turning a profit , too , and is still reaping the benefits from its @entity140 commercial featuring @entity0 's own @entity141			0
the ad references " hard work , conviction and a know - how that runs generations deep in every last one of us			0
" it seems to sum up the feelings of pride in spite of circumstance felt by the residents of the state			0
history has shown that when the city 's sports teams start doing well , it 's a sign of healing in @entity0			2
in 1968 , when the @entity59 won the @entity160 , it brought a racially divided region together after race riots			1
in 1984 , the local economy rebounded from the recession at the same time the @entity59 again won the @entity160			1
what makes 2011 different ? the @entity59 ' magical summer is being followed by a surprisingly solid performance from the usually underperforming @entity5 , behind a triple threat of quarterback @entity169 , wide receiver @entity170 and defensive tackle @entity171			1
it 's not just that the @entity5 are winning but how they 're doing it			1
they were down 20 points against the @entity173 on the road september 25 and then , the following sunday , down 24 points against the @entity176 on the road			0
the @entity5 won both games , representing the city 's come - from - behind spirit and fight to win in the midst of adversity			1
this tenacity is not lost on @entity37 , the coach , who has seen the @entity5 at their worst and now their best			2
" when i became the @entity5 coach , it did n't take me long to understand what the team means to the people here , " @entity37 said			1
" no matter how bad it has been , they have never stopped caring			0
they are vocal but never apathetic			0
it 's like a lawn that has been dormant			0
it just takes one good watering , and it 's back			0
" @entity141 's tag line in january 's @entity136 ad -- " that 's who we are			0
that 's our story " -- sums up the motivation for these teams who know that the wins are helping @entity3 's image and giving residents a sense of hope and pride that 's been missing			2
it seems that @entity0 is back -- for now .			0
