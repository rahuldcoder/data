-- sad face of the day : adulthood is just an endless string of irritating to - dos			1
they hang over your right shoulder in an angry gray cloud , extending in billowy tendrils into your consciousness whenever you begin to think about sinking into a lawn chair in the backyard or inviting some neighbors over for a themed poker night			1
" you should be productiiiiiive , " they nag you in a sibilant whisper			2
" to be fair , technology has done a decent job of cutting down on said inconveniences			2
at one point , you had to use your own two feet or hitch up a carriage to go into town and pick up some edibles			2
then : the car ! and now : @entity25 , which has made us so immobile we actually roll our eyes when we have to get up to let the delivery boy inside			2
so he can deliver our groceries directly to our kitchens			2
still , there are plenty of bothersome tasks that technology has n't yet eliminated			2
it 's done its best , though , to at least make the odious tasks less so			2
with that in mind , we give you : three major drags , and the apps that 'll make them ... well ... if not fun , a bit less miserable			0
the drag : losing those last 10 pounds ... or the first 10 pounds , as the case may be ( and probably is )			0
lucky for you , some new - ish gadgets and tools stoke your competitive streak to get you out of that permanent , butt - shaped indentation you 've left on your @entity51			1
witness up by @entity53 , a bare - bones bracelet ( ok fine , insecure men , " wristband " ) that tracks your activity levels and sleep by sensing movement and lets you sign up for organized challenges ( e.g. , " get 49 hours of sleep per week			1
" ) the @entity63 , a little chapstick - sized clip , has almost identical claims , plus it awards you @entity69 - like badges for hitting fitness milestones ( 15,000 steps in a day ... yahoo! )			1
both gizmos are $ 100 and encourage you to compare your totals with other users , though there probably are n't really enough people in the communities yet to compete with anyone you know			1
if you 're thinking , " one hundred clams for a fancy - pants pedometer ? ! what am i , a sultan ? ! " -- you are probably a miser , in which case , have we got the app for you : @entity89 asks you to predict how many times you 'll make it to the gym in a week			1
check in appropriately , and you 'll earn cash			0
fail miserably , and you owe the site money			0
hey , it 's only annoying if you remain glued to that recliner , butterball			0
the drag : saving up for a trip / surgery / down payment on that @entity103 watch yes , you could spend your tax return on a wild spree at the mall , spittle collecting in frothy flecks on the corners of your mouth as you breathlessly vault from store to store			0
but there 's that hissing conscience again , urging you to sock away the funds instead			0
look , 9 times out of 10 , not spending is way less fun than spending			0
but free personal finance site @entity119 makes saving -- if not enjoyable -- at least candy - colored and pleasant - looking			1
use the " goals " function to map your progress in a bar graph and you might even be likelier to hit the target , according to research from the @entity129			1
when people were more than 60 % to their goal and could see the progress visually , they were more motivated than those who just saw the growing dollar amount			1
the drag : going to the dentist the thing you have to bite on to take x-rays will hurt , your gums will bleed when the dental hygienist goes to town with that little metal weapon , and the dentist will absolutely give you a look when you lie through your filmy , yellow teeth about how often you actually floss			0
these things we can not change			0
but we can encourage you to at least find a hot dentist -- a little eye candy to deliver that message about how you need to cut back on the sweet stuff			0
online directory @entity154 lets you browse health care practitioners by location and the types of insurance accepted			1
you can book an appointment online , read reviews , and -- this is critical -- view pictures of the smiling physicians			1
the service is free for patients ; doctors pay a fee to be listed			0
sure , you would n't want to select your heart surgeon based on his winning smile , but there 's really no harm in choosing a gorgeous dental doc to take care of your pearly whites .			0
