-- more than 2,000 lives lost			0
a vast and unfolding humanitarian crisis			0
and the downing of a civilian airliner that shocked the world			0
it 's hard to imagine -- but true -- that the raging conflict between @entity9 and @entity10 , or at least @entity9 and pro-russian rebels , all started with a humble trade agreement			1
as tensions run high over a @entity10 aid convoy described by @entity17 leaders as a provocative incursion , reports of direct @entity10 military activity inside @entity9 and @entity9 fears of an outright invasion , it 's time to look back on how we got here , and where things are headed : how it started while the roots of the crisis run quite deep , what 's happening now began to unfold in earnest in the fall of 2013			1
that 's when then - @entity9 president @entity34 scuttled a trade deal with the @entity36 that would have pulled the country , so recently a satellite of the @entity39 , toward @entity40 in the latest twirl of a dance that has lasted centuries			1
instead , @entity34 jumped at @entity10 president @entity45 's offer to buy $ 15 billion in debt from his cash - strapped government and cut the price of vital natural gas to the country			1
@entity34 's decision set off protests in @entity9 's more @entity40 - leaning west calling for the government 's ouster			1
security forces responded harshly , beating protesters and firing live ammunition into demonstrations , resulting in several deaths			0
as clashes spread , so did international anger over the situation			0
by late february , @entity34 had fled to @entity10 , the government had fallen and a new @entity65 government had formed to replace it			1
that , in turn , set off @entity69 demonstrations in @entity70 , a semi-autonomous @entity9 republic and the location of a major @entity10 navy base			1
after thousands of @entity10 troops filtered into the territory -- purportedly at the invitation of @entity9 's self - exiled president -- @entity9 's regional parliament called a referendum on secession , and before you could say " borscht , " @entity70 was part of @entity10			1
and it 's here that things turned even uglier			0
pro-russian fighters occupied government buildings in the country 's east , demanding a referendum on independence			0
before long , rebel forces -- believed to be supported by @entity10 -- had taken control of major cities in @entity9 's east			1
fighting broke out between the rebel groups and @entity9 's military , fighting that continues today			1
in a major and likely inadvertent escalation in july , a suspected surface - to - air missile believed to have been operated by @entity69 rebels shot down @entity103 17 , killing all 298 people aboard and hardening @entity17 opinion , particularly in @entity40 , against @entity10			2
what 's happening now @entity9 's military has been on the offensive recently against the @entity69 forces , but those successes seem to have slowed			1
@entity10 troops remain camped along the @entity9 border , @entity17 leaders say			1
and @entity9 officials said tuesday that they had detained 10 @entity10 soldiers in the @entity116 region of eastern @entity9 , further evidence , @entity118 says , of direct @entity10 involvement in the conflict			1
meanwhile , the @entity121 has warned of a growing humanitarian crisis sure only to get worse unless something is done to stem the fighting			0
what 's next a full - scale invasion is unlikely			0
while @entity45 's approval rating among @entity10 is sky - high , recent polling shows the @entity10 people are n't wild about an out - and - out invasion of @entity9 , said @entity132 , the chief geopolitical analyst for @entity133			1
" he may be a dictator , but dictators care about public opinion as much as democrats , " he said			0
but any talk of peace from @entity45 is likely a stalling tactic			0
@entity45 is buying time so that he can continue slipping arms and aid to help rebels recover from their recent losses , said @entity145 , senior vice president of @entity40 and @entity146 at the @entity147			0
" his best option is to have a permanent frozen conflict , " she said			0
fall and winter will slow the fighting			0
@entity151 said the colder seasons in @entity9 mean mud and mud means a slower tempo for military operations			2
just do n't expect total silence , he says -- there will still be fighting			0
@entity160 will try to squeeze @entity9			2
@entity45 will slow the flow of crucial natural gas and goods into @entity9 , putting further pressure on @entity118 's economy and war - fighting ability			2
" the @entity10 will try everything to weaken the regime in @entity118 , " @entity151 said			2
the @entity169 has some soul - searching to do			0
sanctions applied by the @entity172 and @entity40 against @entity10 have so far only played into @entity45 's playbook , enhancing the image of an aggrieved @entity10 trying to shake off its detractors , @entity170 said			2
@entity45 's strategy of assembling a larger @entity10 empire has significant ramifications for @entity179 and @entity180 , @entity170 said , raising questions about just what the @entity169 will do to stop @entity10 if @entity45 chooses to further extend his reach			2
and what will it take to end this ? @entity9 is a linchpin of @entity45 's plans for @entity10 , whether it 's reassembling a historical empire or shoring up the @entity10 economy , @entity170 says			1
so whatever happens must support that			0
@entity151 says @entity45 ca n't pull back without gaining assurances that @entity9 will never become part of @entity195			1
@entity9 , he said , needs assurances about its sovereignty and energy security .			2

the @entity9 conflict started with a dispute over a trade deal
that *ballooned* into protests , then @entity10 *stepped* in
looking forward , an outright invasion seems unlikely , analysts say
it wo n't be easy to unravel the *complex* political and economic forces *tugging* at @entity9
