@entity8 said he trusted @entity20 's advice on how to get the items back			1
he said he believed the items were stolen and he wanted to give them to his children someday			0
" the overall advice that he gave me is that you have a right to get your stuff			0
he gave me an example that if you 're walking the street and you see your laptop in a car , you can use force to break the window of the car , " @entity8 told the court			1
" @entity40 is a pretty forceful guy , and he sort of takes over , " @entity8 said			1
when @entity8 expressed concerns about going to trial and possibly being convicted , " he said , ' relax , relax , @entity0 i got it , i got it			1
i will get you out of this , ' " @entity8 testified			2
@entity20 frequently stated " i got it , i got it , " @entity8 continued			2
" you could never really say what you 're feeling because he got it			0
" the 65 - year - old former football star was convicted of leading a group of associates into a room at the @entity60 hotel and casino and using threats , guns and force to take back items from the two dealers			1
@entity8 testified that @entity20 advised him that he could demand his property back from the dealers , and if they refused to return it , he could use some force , but he could not trespass			2

@entity8 and co-defendants would later be accused of using a weapon			2
galanter is scheduled to testify friday in the proceedings on @entity8 's new trial request			1
on wednesday , @entity8 testified he did n't know of any weapons being present when he and five co-defendants confronted the memorabilia dealers in the hotel room			2
" but i suspect " there were , he testified			0
of the five men who went with @entity8 to the room , four pleaded guilty to reduced charges in exchange for their testimony at trial , but @entity94 faced a jury conviction alongside @entity8			1
@entity94 later won a court order for a new trial			0
in 2011 , @entity94 was sentenced to three years ' probation after entering an @entity101 plea to robbery and conspiracy to commit robbery , meaning he did n't admit guilt but acknowledged that prosecutors could prove their case , the @entity98 reported then			2
by testifying against his former attorney , @entity8 waived his right to the attorney - client privilege in the 2007 case , but his attorney in this week 's court proceedings said @entity8 has no concerns about losing those protections			1
" i am confident mr. @entity0 has not told him anything that would inculpate him because i 'm confident the truth is he did not intend to commit any crime			0
so , no , i 'm not worried , " attorney @entity121 said			2
a deputy escorted @entity8 to the stand wednesday and unlocked the manacles binding his hands to his waist			2
his feet were also shackled			0
the former @entity129 player was heavier and had more gray hair than when he gained notoriety in the mid- 1990s in his trial on charges of killing his ex-wife and her friend			2
a jury acquitted him in that case			0
in court wednesday , @entity8 recounted his working relationship with @entity20 , who he said had a conflict of interest in the case and failed to mount an effective defense			2
" @entity40 had a relationship with the media and he would go on various shows to refute the tabloid stories , " @entity8 said			0
" he had a good relationship with the media and consequently i was in the media a lot , and that gave him an opportunity to go on tv			0
" under questioning by his attorney , @entity8 seemed relaxed , alert and attentive to each question			1
his voice was low and at times raspy			0
his left wrist manacled to his waist , creating an image of a one - armed man as he gestured only with his right hand in animated moments			0
the courtroom gallery is small , occupied mainly by journalists , and the hearing lacked the big media spectacle of prior @entity8 court appearances			0
the proceeding is being heard by @entity171 district judge @entity170 , who will also rule on @entity8 's request			1
in documents filed requesting the new trial , @entity8 argued that @entity20 prevented him from testifying on his own behalf , leaving nothing to challenge evidence put forward by prosecutors of criminal intent and other issues			1
because @entity8 did n't testify in the 2008 trial , he now " wants to tell his story , " attorney @entity181 said tuesday , the second day of the hearing			1
" there are 19 issues here in our writ and all you need is one of them to be granted and mr. @entity0 gets a new trial , " @entity181 said			0
" it just seems overwhelming that more than one of them should or would be granted and i 'm confident he 'll get a new trial			0
" @entity8 is serving a 33 - year prison term and is eligible for parole in 2017			1
