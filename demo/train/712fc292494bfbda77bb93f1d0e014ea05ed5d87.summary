@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 president @entity3 officially named @entity4 to a second term as prime minister in a televised ceremony thursday			1
@entity3 gave a speech and handed a letter to the prime minister , asking him to form a new government after a months - long political stalemate that drew fears of a resurgence in sectarian and insurgent violence			1
@entity4 has 30 days to work with rival factions and form a government or face the prospect of losing the president 's nomination			1
" i know very well , as do you , that the task i have been designated with is not an easy one , especially with @entity1 's current circumstances , " @entity4 said			2
" so i urge the great @entity1 people ... and my brothers the politicians to work on getting past all the disputes that had dominated the past stages			2
" @entity4 's nomination came after months of delicate power - sharing negotiations within @entity1 's fledgling democracy			1
earlier this month , former @entity1 prime minister @entity34 offered a grim prediction for the future of @entity1 's government after a dramatic walkout staged by @entity40 lawmakers in the @entity42 bloc			1
" we think the concept of power - sharing is dead now , " the secular @entity43 said			1
" the @entity42 bloc , led by @entity34 , had threatened to shun negotiations on sharing power with @entity50 and @entity43			2
but just days after the walkout , the principal political blocs agreed to establish a committee to negotiate aspects of the deal			0
@entity56 , an @entity42 member of parliament , said the walk - out was a " misunderstanding			0
" his bloc will take a " real part " in the government , he said , and will play the role of " positive opposition " by monitoring the performance of the government			0
@entity66 , an @entity1 @entity67 lawmaker , said mediation efforts by @entity67 officials , @entity70 and the @entity71 began after the walkout			0
president @entity73 and other @entity70 officials praised the new power - sharing agreement			1
" there are still challenges to overcome , but all indications are that the government will be representative , inclusive and reflect the will of the @entity1 people who cast their ballots in the last election , " @entity73 said at the @entity77 summit in @entity78 , @entity79 this month			2
under the proposed deal , the three major governmental positions were to be filled by three members of the country 's largest ethnic groups : the @entity43 , the @entity50 and the @entity40			0
the deal also intended to create a powerful new office -- expected to be headed by @entity34 , @entity4 's rival -- that would serve to check the new prime minister 's influence			1
but @entity34 rejected the office , saying he would no longer take up the position			0
" i personally have made up my mind			0
i will not be a part of this theater , " @entity34 said			0
