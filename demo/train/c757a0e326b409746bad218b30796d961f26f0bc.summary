@entity0 , @entity1 -- an @entity5 cleric was arrested monday for playing a key role in the establishment of a militant training camp in @entity1 's @entity10 region , authorities said			2
@entity11 -- a religious leader known for his anti-western rhetoric -- has been arrested twice previously for his activities in connection with militant groups			1
he was detained early monday in @entity16 and was later brought to the @entity17 for further questioning			0
authorities have strong evidence that @entity11 played a role in establishing a terror cell and a militant training camp in @entity10 province , said @entity17 spokesman inspector general @entity25			1
police raided that camp in february and arrested dozens of militants who were allegedly planning terror attacks in @entity1 similar to those that took place in @entity32 , @entity33 , in 2008			1
@entity11 knew about that camp , helped fund it and appointed religious teachers to provide the militants with spiritual guidance , officials said			1
he also allegedly appointed an extremist fugitive known as @entity41 as the field commander			0
@entity41 was killed in another police raid shortly afterward			0
in may , several members of a hardline organization @entity11 founded -- the @entity46 , or @entity46 -- were also arrested and charged with raising funds for the training camp			1
following months of speculation on @entity11 's involvement , police said it 's clear he played a key role in setting up the terror sell that wanted to base itself in @entity10			1
police also uncovered a new plot by a terror cell to launch fresh attacks on the national police headquarters and several unnamed hotels and embassies in @entity0			1
this information came about after the arrests of four people over the weekend in @entity16			0
and police said the terror cell put up a laboratory to test bombs and twice blew up explosives in a remote area in @entity70 , @entity16			1
a @entity72 national allegedly supplied a car to the suspected terrorists to use for a car bomb , according to authorities			0
the @entity72 national is still at large			0
@entity11 was first arrested after the @entity78 bombings in 2002 where more than 200 people were killed			1
at the time , he was the spiritual leader of @entity80 , whose stated goal is to create an @entity5 state comprising @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity1 and the southern @entity85			1
he was charged with rebellion , terrorism and immigration violations			0
prosecutors convicted of him of immigration violations and rebellion , but the latter conviction dismissed on appeal			0
@entity11 served 18 months in jail			2
two years later , before his expected release in 2004 , @entity11 was arrested again on charges of helping incite the august 2003 bombing of the @entity96 in @entity0			2
he served two and a half years in jail and was released in june 2006			0
in 2008 , @entity11 established @entity98			2
" i 'm sure the police have a very strong case			0
they would not arrest him for the third time otherwise , " said terrorism expert @entity101 of the @entity102 , a non-profit that works to prevent and resolve deadly conflict			0
" it 's a mark of police confidence that they would go forward with this arrest , and attests to the weakening of the radical networks			2
but @entity11 's influence has been declining			1
so , the fact that he 's been taken out of circulation again will not have a major impact one way or another on the security situation			0

police : @entity11 funded and *approved* of a terror plot
@entity11 is the one - time leader of @entity80
he now heads another hardline group
police raided the second group 's headquarters in may
