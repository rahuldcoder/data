-- a federal judge has allowed @entity6 to enforce the most controversial part of its politically charged immigration law , the so - called " show me your papers " provision			1
in an order on tuesday , @entity10 district judge @entity9 upheld the section allowing authorities , while enforcing other laws , to question the immigration status of people who may be in the @entity10 illegally			2
the @entity17 in june tossed out most other aspects of the tough new law but said the part known by critics as the " show me your papers " provision could go into effect , at least for now			1
the hot - button immigration issue is a major attack line in this year 's presidential campaign with @entity28 , led by @entity29 , accusing president @entity30 of failing to devise a comprehensive strategy to deal with illegal immigration			1
@entity6 is the nation 's most heavily traveled corridor for illegal immigration and smuggling			1
the @entity36 said @entity6 's population of two million @entity38 includes an estimated 400,000 there illegally , and 60 % to 70 % of deportations or " removals " involve @entity42 nationals			2
the @entity43 recently issued a report that found that @entity42 immigration to the @entity10 has come to a standstill			0
however , the debate continues as more than 10 million unauthorized immigrants -- from @entity42 and other countries -- continue to live in the @entity10			0
@entity51 's decision was in response to a suit that followed the @entity17 ruling by a number of individuals and civil rights groups who said enforcement would lead to racial profiling			0
it would be up to @entity6 to decide when to enforce the measure and there was no sign that would occur immediately			2
it was not clear if the coalition of civil rights groups and individuals would appeal tuesday 's ruling or wait to see how the law is enforced			0
what 's next in the @entity6 immigration battle ? " there is a basic uncertainty about what the law means and how it will be enforced , " said @entity17 @entity72 in late june , making clear that @entity6 authorities must comply with federal law in conducting the immigration status checks or face further constitutional challenges			1
@entity6 gov. @entity81 , a @entity28 who led the fight to pass the overall law , applauded the latest court order , saying it gives law enforcement " one more tool " to use " in collaborating with federal authorities to reduce the crime and other impacts associated with illegal immigration			1
" she said the law " must be enforced efficiently , effectively and in harmony with the @entity93 and civil rights			0
" the @entity98 , which had asked @entity51 to block the provision , said it was prepared to continue challenging the law by documenting instances of racial profiling throughout the state , @entity96 , executive director of the legal group in @entity6 , said in a statement			1
the @entity17 struck down other challenged parts of the @entity6 law , upholding the broad authority of the federal government to set immigration policy and laws			1
among provisions tossed by the high court was a measure that authorized police to arrest illegal immigrants without a warrant where " probable cause " existed that they committed a public offense making them removable from the country			0
the @entity6 law generated immediate controversy after it was signed by @entity123 in april 2010 , prompting an @entity30 administration challenge			1
supporters of the @entity6 measure contend the federal government has failed to enforce existing immigration laws , leaving it to states to take their own steps to deal with mounting economic and social problems caused by illegal immigrants			2
administration officials have said the @entity135 expects increased requests from @entity6 police to check the immigration status of suspects			2
however , they said the department will get involved only in high - priority cases			0
several other states followed @entity6 's lead by passing laws meant to deter illegal immigrants			0
similar laws are under challenge in lower courts in @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and @entity152			0
@entity6 's appeal is the first to reach the @entity17			0
at issue was whether states have any authority to step in to regulate immigration matters or whether that is the exclusive role of the federal government			0
in dry legal terms , this constitutional issue is known as pre-emption			0
the district court case is @entity10 v. @entity6 ( 10 - cv - 1413 )			1
undocumented immigrants face arrest as they proclaim , ' no papers , no fear ' @entity149 appeals ruling on immigration law immigration lawsuit revives @entity172 debate			1
