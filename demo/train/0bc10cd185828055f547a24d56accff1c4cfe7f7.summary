in an odd way , i sense calm as cars and buses whiz by at rush hour			2
it is a sign of normalcy			0
the snow has stopped falling and more people are out and about on this afternoon			0
@entity9 almost looks like it did before that august day when @entity10 was shot and killed			0
except the reminders that are hard to miss. the burned and looted @entity13 gas station			0
and on @entity15 , a block away , a memorial to @entity10			0
businesss owners covered up windows and doors with plywood after protesters clashed with police on @entity9			1
some had taken the plywood down but have put the boards back up , ahead of a grand jury decision on whether to indict police officer @entity26			1
it is as if they are readying for a storm			0
they scribbled the word " @entity32 " on the plywood			1
and neighborhood kids wasted no time making their mark with spray - painted graffiti			1
but on thursday , artist @entity37 was out covering up some of the scars , creating beauty amid the ugliness			1
i watch as he picks up a roller and applies a layer of glue on the plywood covering up a window to @entity47			1
he positions one of his photographs and sticks it on			0
" the plywood is so ugly , " he says			2
@entity37 was among those who took to the streets to demand accountability for @entity10 's death			1
what happened in @entity56 , he says , should never again happen anywhere in @entity58			0
it is personal for him			0
he is a 29 - year - old black man who was born and raised in impoverished @entity61			2
racial inequities have always been big in his artistic expressions			0
he took photos of the hands of the people around him at the @entity56 protests			1
old ones and young ones			0
and he made them into posters to display in public			0
" we have a lot of people from a lot of backgrounds coming together , " he says			0
" people look at the hands and kind of get it instantly			2
" hands have become a big symbol for @entity56 protesters who allege that @entity26 shot @entity10 even though he was unarmed and , they say , had his hands up in the air			1
some @entity26 supporters , however , say @entity10 was a thief and a thug who scuffled with the officer and provoked him into shooting			0
@entity37 ' art caught my eye instantly as i drove down @entity9 , past fast food shops , beauty stores , laundromats and convenience stores , all made ugly by the plywood			1
@entity102 and @entity103 help @entity37 put up his work			1
@entity37 is only 14 and in the eighth grade			1
but he says he wants to be out here , helping the cause			0
a local store donated a cooler full of peanut butter and jelly sandwiches and milk			0
it is the only food the crew had eaten since morning			0
@entity37 is grateful that local businesses are supportive , especially since they paid a heavy price in lost revenues after the protests erupted			1
as a young artist , @entity37 hoped to retain a fascination and wonder for the process of storytelling			1
that 's what his web page statement says			2
but never did he expect to find himself walking @entity9 , plastering his art over boarded - up shops			1
now his hands stand as memorial			2
and , he says , as hope amid despair			2
he has many more sheets of plywood to cover as i leave him for the justice center in @entity136 where the grand jury decision is expected to be announced at any moment			1
in the rear view mirror , @entity9 fades , just for a minute , and i see only the prints of hands on paper .			2

@entity37 saw the hands of fellow protesters as a symbol of unity
he is covering the plywood on boarded - up businesses with photos of those hands
he wants them to signal hope in a town on edge , awaiting a grand jury 's *verdict*
