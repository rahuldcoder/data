editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			0
@entity9 is @entity5 's site devoted to the overlap between culture and technology			0
the reports , which are being produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- video game pioneer @entity24 resides in a castle - like mansion outside of @entity28 , @entity29 , that would be the fantasy dwelling for any grown - up kid			1
but his favorite place to live is a five - bedroom fixer - upper some 250 miles up			0
in 2008 , @entity24 parlayed his success in the video game industry into a lifelong dream : to fly to the @entity37			1
" literally , throughout my entire professional career , i 've been investing in the privatization of space , " says @entity24			2
" helping to unlock the gates of private space travel			0
" life back on @entity44 is far from boring for lord @entity45 , as he 's known to video game fanatics the world over			1
over the years , he 's amassed a spectacular array of toys , ranging from medieval weapons to a fully - functional observatory dome			0
@entity55 , @entity24 's haunted house / amusement park residence in @entity28 is a veritable shrine to discovery , teeming with sentimental and inventive nods to the importance of science and curiosity			1
in 2009 , @entity63 producer @entity62 traveled to @entity24 's home to learn how his whimsical yet inherently scientific modus operandi is helping to usher in a new generation of exploration			1
not to mention , securing his seat as " nerd par excellence " for brandishing an impressive collection of rare and unreleased versions of " @entity46 " series			0
@entity24 is perhaps most famous for developing the seminal video game series , " @entity75 " and coining the term @entity76 , or @entity76 , under his lord @entity45 moniker			1
his success as a game developer earned him a stately fortune , with which he had long hoped to become the first private citizen to go to space			2
he was n't the first -- the burst of the dot - com bubble led @entity24 to sell his spot to @entity86			0
@entity24 would become the sixth private citizen to reach space , a distinction held only by a handful of people , including engineer and first self - funded woman and @entity95 citizen in space , @entity96 and entrepreneur / philanthropist / poker player @entity97			2
but do n't call them space tourists -- they 're " spaceflight participants " who 've paid millions and spent years in training ( and learning @entity104 ) in preparation for orbit			2
see the rest of " @entity108 " @entity24 's salad days were spent nearby @entity29 ' @entity110 , where his father , scientist and early space shuttle astronaut @entity111 was stationed			1
he grew up in a community of astronauts and rocket scientists , nurturing his belief that space would become a common destination for everyone -- sooner rather than later			1
with the space shuttle program gearing up for its last two scheduled flights , @entity24 has become an ambassador of the next monumental relationship between mankind and the cosmos -- the privatization of space			1
when the space shuttle program does finally end in june , leaving behind an exciting 30 - year history , some of @entity133 's facilities will be turned over to @entity136 ( @entity136 ) , the leading contender in an industry poised to help @entity133 send astronauts and materials to the iss. meanwhile , an important corollary to missions contracted by the government are those with more regal intentions , such as sir @entity145 's @entity144 , which aims to offer sub-orbital spaceflights to anyone who can shell out $ 200,000 for a flight			0
somewhere in between this new spectrum of chartered space flight sits pioneers like @entity24 , who is showing that even without @entity133 's support , everyone should get excited outer space , and have a chance to get there too .			2

video game pioneer @entity24 is also avid space fan
was one of world 's first space tourists and is ambassador for space privatization
@entity24 's *vision* is for space to become common destination for everyone
