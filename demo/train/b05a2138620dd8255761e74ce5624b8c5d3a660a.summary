-- i hope president @entity2 called to congratulate @entity3			1
the way he called college student @entity6 after @entity7 called her a " prostitute			0
" the way he called the @entity12 's first openly gay player , @entity13			2
the way he called the @entity15 after they won the @entity16			0
i hope he called @entity3 because her story is every bit as unlikely , courageous and yes , inspirational , as his own			1
love -- the first black @entity21 woman elected to @entity22 -- will not be his political ally and that 's ok			1
i spoke with membership services and blacks are no longer revoked for voting @entity21			1
if you do n't believe me , please note the most popular black television character on network television is @entity31 's " @entity30			1
" she worked to elect a @entity21 president twice and no one on # blacktwitter calls her an @entity36			2
love is progress , whether so - called progressives want to embrace it or not			0
her election is a reflection , yea an extension of the rev.			0
the daughter of @entity49 immigrants , born in @entity50 , living in @entity51 , a state that is less than 1 % black , judged by the content of her character			0
and because of that , she is coming to @entity57			0
if that is not what the dream is all about then we truly have lost our way			0
as @entity64 spend the remainder of the week infighting after losing the @entity67 , licking wounds from gubernatorial defeats in blue / purple states such as @entity71 and @entity72 , and searching for survivors in what can only be described as a midterm slaughter , i ca n't help but wonder if the victor with the most influence on 2016 is @entity3			1
for if the sexist / racist / anti-immigration narrative that has long dogged the @entity21 can , at the very least , be challenged by her presence at a campaign , what will @entity64 use to fire up low - information liberals ? the blue 's yin to the red 's " @entity2 is the worse president ever " yang			1
not to mention that @entity3 ( along with @entity92 's @entity91 , the first black senator elected in the @entity93 ) is an affront to those @entity21 voters who do harbor racist thoughts			1
whether @entity3 and @entity91 will go along to get along when the conversation regarding immigration or public assistance starts to sound a little too much like the @entity21 of the 1990s remains to be seen			1
but what is clear is that @entity3 knows how to overcome adversity			2
her father worked as a janitor , among other jobs , to put her through school at the @entity106			0
after speaking at the @entity109 in 2012 , where she said " my parents immigrated to the @entity113 with $ 10 in their pocket ... when times got tough , they did n't look to @entity57 , they looked within " as well as that @entity2 's " policies have failed			2
" afterward , her wikipedia page was vandalized , as those who did n't approve of her brief address called her a " whore , " " sellout " and " @entity122 -- r. " insert " war on women " joke here			0
the first time she ran for @entity22 , she lost			2
yet through it all , she persevered			0
perhaps when sen. @entity129 said the @entity21 had a shot to attract a third of the black vote in 2016 , he had @entity3 in mind			1
folks can identify with the pull - yourself - up - by - the - bootstraps narrative that is often embraced by @entity21 minority candidates in one way or another			2
for more than 40 years , @entity64 presidential candidates have enjoyed the support of more than 80 % of black voters , and yet the community 's unemployment rate remains twice that of its white counterpart			1
the wealth gap between blacks and whites has grown			0
the criminal justice system is riddled with discrepancies along racial lines			0
@entity129 has spoken about these concerns with compassion , albeit clumsily at times			0
newly elected @entity71 gov. @entity153 , a @entity21 , aggressively went after the black vote in @entity155 â € ” despite it being president @entity2 's backyard â € ” with a message that he could turn around the economic woes that have hampered the community			1
and in turn he did manage to receive endorsements from numerous pastors and high - profile blacks			0
of course it did n't hurt that the wealthy @entity21 invested $ 1 million of his own money in the @entity167 , which is in a predominantly black neighborhood			1
" ( he 's ) taking the black vote for granted , " @entity153 said in a debate with @entity170 that was sponsored by the @entity171			2
while he ended up with only 6 % of the black vote , the fact that he would be so bold with his intentions shows the days of republicans ignoring the black vote may in fact be gone			2
just south of @entity180 , @entity179 incumbent gov. @entity178 received 26 % of the black vote			0
if blacks are willing to buck the trend and vote @entity21 , then it would only make sense that the @entity21 would have black candidates			1
and black elected officials , like @entity3 , an outsider who came out of nowhere to shock the world and claim her own piece of the dream			1
sort of like another history - making black elected official we know .			0

@entity3 became the first black @entity21 woman in @entity22
@entity195 says her life story is inspirational and reflects @entity46 's dream
he says @entity3 's story shows that @entity64 do n't have *exclusive* right to black voters
