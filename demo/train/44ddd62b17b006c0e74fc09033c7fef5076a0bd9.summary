-- that was an interesting week ! on wednesday , @entity2 brought me a piece of startling news : a lawyer speaking to a tribunal of the @entity8 had accused me of acting as a paid agent of the government of @entity11			1
no , seriously , that 's what the man said			2
from @entity11 's @entity15 on may 23 : " counsel @entity16 had claimed in a statement that a @entity11 embassy provided funds to @entity20 and @entity21 for damage control after the memo controversy			1
" i was so taken aback by the claim that i telephoned @entity16 to ask whether it was true			0
we had a short but intense exchange			0
@entity16 flew immediately into a rage at me , accused me of harassing him , insisted that i was somehow violating @entity11 law by telephoning him , refused to confirm or deny the @entity15 account and ended by inviting me to sue him for defamation			1
my confidence in the @entity11 system of justice not being very high , i declined the latter invitation			1
but given that @entity16 's charges have gained a hearing inside @entity11 , some kind of answer seems due			1
@entity16 's charges are false , of course			2
more surprising than the falsehood , though , is the sheer laziness of the charge			2
where is the fake evidence ? the forged check , the bogus wire transfer , the suborned courier ? money always leaves a record			2
can you really stand up in front of a @entity11 tribunal and spout whatever fool nonsense pops into your head ? apparently so			1
yet as ludicrous as are @entity16 's statements about me -- i 'll leave @entity20 to speak for himself -- this small comedy is a piece of a much larger drama			2
on october 10 , @entity63 's @entity62 printed an opinion piece that contained an arresting claim : the author said he had personally conveyed a memo from the @entity68 in the @entity69 to the chairman of the @entity71 , requesting @entity69 help to prevent a military coup			2
the story was dramatic and important , but there was one troubling element : the byline on the piece			0
the author was @entity80 , a writer with a long , long history of discredited assertions			0
remember the story about the @entity85 administration rejecting a 1996 offer by the government of @entity88 to extradite @entity89 ? that story , investigated and debunked by the @entity91 , continues to circulate among the @entity69 right to this day			0
that story was the work of @entity80 , the first -- but not the last -- of his disproven allegations			0
( click here for a comprehensive list by @entity0 's @entity98 and by @entity99			0
) yet despite the dubious source , the @entity62 story ignited a firestorm in @entity11			1
@entity11 's ambassador to the @entity69 was forced to resign			1
not content with his first success , @entity80 added further allegations , including one that the government of @entity11 had been tipped off the to @entity89 raid			1
that latter claim was even more explosive : @entity109 only last week , a @entity11 court sentenced to 33 years in prison a local doctor convicted of helping the @entity69 track @entity89			1
@entity80 : @entity11 is stronger after ' memogate ' now to my part in the story			1
writing here at @entity0 in december , i ridiculed @entity80 's suggestion that the @entity69 government would ever have shared such information with the government of @entity11 , and reminded readers of @entity80 's history of unreliability			1
this column caught the attention of authorities inside @entity11			1
@entity11 had convened a special commission of its @entity8 to investigate @entity80 's memo allegations			1
on march 15 , that commission asked @entity80 to answer my column			0
@entity80 , who was under oath , told the tribunal that he had sued me for libel			0
he said , " in view of the fact mr. @entity21 defamed me , my lawyers in @entity135 informed him that if he does not retract , i will be taking legal action against him			2
" ( you can read the transcript here			0
this exchange is on page 43			0
) this statement was untrue			0
no lawyer for @entity80 had ever contacted me , i was never threatened with legal action over the column , and i did not retract it , points i made in a follow - up column march 21			0
@entity16 is @entity80 's counsel before the investigating commission			0
i surmise it was irritation with my march 21 column that led @entity16 to concoct the new accusation that i was a @entity11 government spy			1
my sense , from the distance of @entity135 , is that @entity11 are slowly coming to the realization that the memo controversy was a hoax			1
yet as with the false charges against @entity85 , the damage to @entity11 civil institutions from the memo controversy will not soon be undone			2
those western media organizations that enabled the hoax have a reckoning to do			0
@entity80 has a long and proven record of false reporting about some of the most serious issues of international security			0
it seems only elementary editorial prudence to decline to put media institutions ever again at risk of publishing further false stories , by closing their pages and their tv studios against such a man with such a record			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity21 .			2

@entity21 : lawyer in @entity11 accused him of being a paid agent of that country
he says the lawyer offered no evidence to back up the *spurious* charge
@entity21 says the context of the accusation is @entity11 's " memogate " *scandal*
he says the evidence makes it seem likely that " memogate " is a hoax
