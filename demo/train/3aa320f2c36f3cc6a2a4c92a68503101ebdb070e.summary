@entity0 -- tens of thousands of anti-government protesters took to the streets of @entity6 's capital sunday , some surrounding the home of prime minister @entity9 , whom they want to oust			1
an estimated 90,000 protesters were marching in @entity0 , lt. gen. @entity11 , @entity6 's national security chief , told @entity1			2
he said that number rose to 150,000 at the peak of the rally in the late afternoon			0
he earlier said 10,000 had surrounded the premier 's home while she tours the northeast provinces			1
the demonstration there was later disbanded			2
in a bid to cool tensions , @entity9 dissolved the nation 's parliament earlier this month and called for new elections , to be held on february 2			1
but the move has done little to appease anti-government protesters , who remained on the streets by the thousands			2
the main opposition party , the @entity30 , has said it will boycott the polls			1
speaking on one of the main stages set up at the rally , protest leader @entity32 asked demonstrators to surround a sports complex where candidates seeking to put themselves forward for the election will have to register their names			1
candidates have from monday to friday to do so			0
@entity42 beefed up security at the complex was being stepped up ahead of the start of registration , @entity11 said , but he could not give figures			0
during the weeks of demonstrations , protesters have occupied various government offices			1
the rallies have been mostly peaceful , but there have also been deadly clashes between protesters and government supporters			2
protest leaders have said they want to rid @entity6 of the influence of former prime minister @entity58 , the older brother of @entity9			1
that 's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with @entity58 , who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to @entity6 's rural heartland			0
@entity58 was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas			0
if he returns , he risks a two - year prison sentence on a corruption conviction , which he says was politically motivated			0
the current protests in @entity0 were prompted by a botched attempt by @entity9 's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother 's return			1
that move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother 's puppet , an allegation she has repeatedly denied			0
@entity1 's @entity88 contributed to this report			0
