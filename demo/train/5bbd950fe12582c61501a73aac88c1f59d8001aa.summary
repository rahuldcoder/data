-- the death toll in @entity4 is probably now approaching 70,000 , @entity2 @entity1 said tuesday			1
in early january , @entity1 said that 60,000 people in @entity4 had died , a figure that she called " truly shocking			1
" she blamed the international community for failing to act			2
at that time , @entity0 tried to put the number in perspective			0
sixty thousand people is roughly the population of @entity12 , @entity13 ; or @entity14 , @entity15			0
it 's how many people would fit in @entity18 , and it 's more than the 50,000 - plus @entity21 combat deaths in @entity22			2
the war in @entity4 has been raging since march 2011 when protesters , partly inspired by @entity26 uprisings in the region , began demonstrating for more freedom			1
that movement quickly morphed into a movement against president @entity31 , who was appointed president by @entity4 's rubber - stamp parliament in 2000 after his father died			1
the largely amorphous group of anti-al - @entity31 rebels who have been trying to oust @entity31 , the @entity37 , has had many casualties , but many innocent civilians have died			0
no area of the country seems safe			0
the opposition activist organization @entity42 ( @entity42 ) said 136 people were killed in war - related violence across @entity4 on tuesday , including 47 in @entity46 and its suburbs , and 32 in @entity48			1
@entity0 can not independently verify those figures			0
in mid-january , @entity50 was the scene of horrific violence			0
one student described to @entity0 his dizzying attempt to help another after bombs exploded at the school , saying that he reached out his hand to help only to wind up grasping a fellow student 's severed hand			2
every day looks the same in @entity4			1
@entity62 's forces bombard neighborhoods			2
body counts are recorded by anti-government rebels and activists			0
@entity2 envoys -- two of them so far -- have tried to negotiate to end to the fighting			1
in late january , envoy @entity70 tried to persuade the @entity71 to do something			1
" @entity4 is being destroyed bit by bit and , in destroying @entity4 , the region is being pushed into a situation that is extremely bad and extremely important for the entire world , " he said after meeting with the body in private			1
throughout the war , there have been several instances in which observers have surmised that the bloodshed might be near an end			2
they 've been wrong every time			0
@entity62 has made those predictions seem even more foolish when he 's given speeches in which he says all his government is doing is fighting back " terrorists			2
" there are @entity4 who still very much support @entity31 , too			1
for example , in a recent @entity0 exclusive , @entity0 's @entity91 reported from @entity94 , a predominantly @entity95 town outside @entity46 that is standing firmly behind @entity31			0
" i do n't know why , but we love the president very much , " said @entity96 , a @entity94 resident and organizer of the town 's militia			0
" sure , there have been mistakes , but we love the president a lot			0
