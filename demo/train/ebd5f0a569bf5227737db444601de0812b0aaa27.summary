for the first time in what seems like ages , @entity0 has passed a government spending plan without resorting to last - minute brinkmanship such as midnight negotiations to prevent an imminent government shutdown			1
the @entity8 voted 64 - 36 on wednesday to send the compromise federal budget framework to president @entity10 , who has signaled his support			1
last week , the budget plan easily passed the @entity13 on a 332 - 94 vote , with solid majorities of both parties supporting it			1
while wednesday 's @entity8 vote was closer , nine @entity17 joined the majority @entity19 to provide the required majority of at least 51 votes to pass			1
the plan guides government spending into 2015 , defusing the chances of a shutdown like the one in october that generated public anger against @entity0 , particularly conservative @entity17 blamed for the impasse			1
budget deal : winners and losers @entity17 rep. @entity33 of @entity34 and @entity19 sen. @entity35 of @entity36 , the budget committee leaders in both chambers , negotiated the deal that eliminates some forced spending cuts known as sequestration that both sides disliked while reducing the deficit by more than $ 20 billion in coming years			1
mixed opinions an @entity47 / @entity46 poll released tuesday showed that 50 % of respondents supported the budget plan while 35 % opposed it			1
according to the survey , a majority of @entity19 and independents backed the proposal , while only 39 % of @entity17 liked it			2
some @entity8 @entity17 have said the most important issue at the moment was to lower the budget deficit , even if only by a small percentage , and avoid another damaging scenario like the 16 - day government shutdown in october			1
@entity17 sen. @entity60 of @entity34 said he wanted " to make sure we avoid any additional government shutdowns			2
" " the federal government does enough harm to our economy , " @entity60 said			0
" we do n't need to add additional harm by this crisis management			0
" poll : @entity0 neck - and - neck with car salespeople , lobbyists for least honest conservative @entity17 sen. @entity71 of @entity72 said in a statement that " sometimes the answer has to be yes			2
" " ultimately , his agreement upholds the principles conservatives stand for and , with @entity19 controlling the @entity13 and the @entity8 , it is the best we can hope for , " he said of the plan			1
other republicans who voted " yes " on wednesday were @entity84 of @entity85 , @entity86 of @entity87 , @entity88 of @entity89 , @entity90 of @entity91 , @entity92 of @entity85 , @entity93 of @entity94 and @entity95 of @entity96			0
@entity19 sen. @entity97 of @entity98 said his side dislikes some elements of the agreement , but that 's life in divided government when the @entity8 and @entity13 are controlled by different parties			1
" we need to get some certainty , and that 's what this does , " he said tuesday night on @entity105 , adding : " nothing 's going to be perfect in this world			0
" budget compromise final congressional approval was a rare example of budget bipartisanship after two years of seemingly endless confrontation and acrimony reflecting the differing ideologies of the two sides			2
republicans , especially the conservative tea party wing that emerged in 2010 , want to drastically shrink the government as the main tool for reducing federal deficits and debt			0
@entity19 insist on protecting the social safety net for the most vulnerable @entity130 , such as @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133			0
with midterm elections next year , the @entity36 dysfunction has spawned public disgust reflected by polls showing support for @entity0 around record low levels			0
@entity10 called the deal " a good first step away from the shortsighted , crisis - driven decision - making that has only served to act as a drag on our economy			2
" the plan the budget agreement , which was months in the making , eases spending caps while softening the impact of the sequestration cuts on defense and non-defense programs			1
it sets overall spending figures through fiscal year 2014 , which started on october 1 , as well as fiscal year 2015 , with the intent of putting off any further congressional budget stalemate until after the november election			2
the strong vote in the sharply divided @entity13 last week brought a collective sigh of relief among supporters , who initially thought it would sail through the @entity8 , where bipartisanship has been more the norm			1
however , some @entity8 republicans -- including several in leadership positions -- came out against the bill			2
" i 'd really like to stay within the ( spending ) caps , " complained @entity17 sen. @entity170 of @entity171			1
" this busts the caps , and as a result , i 'll vote against it			0
" @entity177 sen. @entity177 of @entity178 and others complained that the plan reduces some military pension benefits			1
he called for @entity10 to hold the bill until a bipartisan fix can be found			0
other senators from both parties called for going back later to replace the $ 6 billion in cuts to future cost - of - living increases in military pensions with reductions elsewhere			1
" these heroes lay their lives on the line for us and they deserve us to fix this provision , " @entity92 said before voting for the budget agreement			0
three leading tea party - backed senators with 2016 presidential aspirations -- @entity199 of @entity200 , @entity201 of @entity202 , and @entity203 of @entity204 -- also have come out against the budget compromise for similar reasons			0
democrats wary , too while @entity19 support the bill , many had concerns			0
more liberal senators -- like @entity212 of @entity213 -- complained that an unemployment benefit extension was not included in the deal			0
" there 's over a million people now who can not find a job , out of work , and right at this time of year their unemployment insurance is being cut off , " he told @entity217 last week			0
" it 's really unconscionable			0
" do n't expect @entity224 to totally change his tune			0
