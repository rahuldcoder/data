@entity0 -- @entity2 in @entity0 , one of the last outposts of the global protests sparked by the @entity7 movement , has been ordered to clear its encampment outside one of the world 's largest banks			1
for ten months , protestors have gathered at @entity14 's headquarters in the heart of @entity0 's financial district to air their grievances against corporate greed and social inequality but on monday , a @entity0 court ruled in favor of @entity14 's request to remove protesters camped by the entrance of its @entity26 headquarters			1
although the bank is required by law to provide a passageway for pedestrians at its headquarters , the court ruled that protesters have no legal right to stake their ground			1
" we welcome the decision of the court , " @entity14 spokesperson @entity34 wrote in an email , adding that protesters will have two weeks to clear out before the bank intervenes			1
while the number of active protestors has dwindled , more than a dozen tents remain at the site			0
@entity42 , one of three defendants who appeared in court on monday , has camped under the bank since november			0

he plans to leave the encampment , but hopes to find an alternate place to protest			1
" nowadays , most @entity0 people are n't happy , " @entity42 said			2
" the workers work for their whole lives for @entity0 but they do n't have money to buy food			2
" @entity55 , an active @entity2 member who works as a freelance graphic designer , said the protest sends a crucial anti-capitalist message to a city that is fueled by finance			0
" we plan on coming back if they decide to evict us by force but we 're not going to leave voluntarily , " she added			0
the order to evict occupy protestors in @entity0 comes a week after police cleared @entity69 's encampment outside the @entity71 's headquarters			1

protestors at @entity7 -- where the first occupy protest took place -- were evicted by police from their @entity80 grounds two months in			1
@entity82 's iconic protest at @entity83 was removed by the local council after eight months			2
the @entity85 , which grew to encompass 900 cities , stemmed from a call for an " occupation " of @entity90 's financial center , published in @entity91 , an anti-consumerism magazine based in @entity92 , @entity93			0
the grassroots movement has attracted a disparate group of protesters , bound by grievances toward socioeconomic inequality .			0
