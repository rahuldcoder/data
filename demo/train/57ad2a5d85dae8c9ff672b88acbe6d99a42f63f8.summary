-- " mittens do n't clap , " is how @entity3 - based cowbell importer @entity2 explains it			2
and if you are the proud owner of a cowbell in @entity7 , chances are it passed through her hands en - route to the @entity10 " bells have been used , especially in downhill skiing , for a long time			1
it started in @entity14 , where in summer the cows all walk around the mountains with bells on , " added @entity2			1
" but in winter they are in barns , and the bells are hung up			1
all the farmers were also the ski racers in the old days , so their families went in the barns and grabbed the bells			1
" olympians have told me that when they 're at the bottom of the hill , they can hear a little shouting but they can really hear the cowbells			1
" @entity32 icon watch any ski race on television and you will hear the same dull , persistent background clanging			1
turn up in person and dull is the wrong word : stand in the right ( wrong ? ) place and it 's more a cacophony			2
already steeped in @entity45 history , cowbells have become a global success and @entity32 icon over the last two decades			1
@entity2 got into the business ahead of the @entity48 of 2002 , where the golden , oblong bells became a sought - after souvenir			1
" it 's really a @entity53 cultural thing that , in the past 15 years or so , has grown here in the @entity55 , " she told @entity0			1
" if the @entity14 are coming to an event they 'll bring really big bells , a foot high or more			1
@entity60 has some good bells too , and they come with sheepskins on			1
" how many do we sell ? i quit counting when we reached 70 tons -- and that was before the @entity65			2
" @entity2 imports bells manufactured in @entity67 by a small family business @entity69 , based in a factory south - west of @entity71			1
" my grandfather started it in 1922 , " says head of the company @entity74			2
" he began producing bells for his neighbors ' domestic animals and sheep			1
" the company has changed with the times -- it now makes gps tracking devices for livestock -- but when a @entity32 is within sight , cowbells become their hottest commodity by far			1
" we produce approximately 30,000 bells each year , " says @entity74			1
" for us , it started before the @entity32 in @entity91 in 1994			0
the fans saw it as the only souvenir that let them take the spirit of the @entity32 back home			0
" for the @entity97 , we produced 68,000 bells -- more than two years ' production -- in two months			1
when there is a @entity32 , it dominates our company			0
" i remember producing the bells for @entity105 , working late at night and listening to the @entity48 on the radio			1
i could hear the bells being rung in @entity7 as i was engraving them in @entity67			1
" changing fabric like brass bands , or singing at football matches , the ting - a - ling sensation of a cowbell feels warm and traditional -- part of the very fabric of sport			1
but that fabric is changing			0
where once making noise at events was the responsibility of the fans , clubs and venues increasingly see the atmosphere as theirs to generate , maintain -- and police			1
go to most major sporting events in 2013 and the ambiance will be provided by vast , booming speaker systems			0
in a world of @entity135 , endless tv channels and bewildering freedom of entertainment choice , sports reach out and grab their audience by the ears			1
so is the cowbell a relic of an age when fans were left to their own devices ? " sport now sells music and music sells sport , " says academic @entity143 , who researches the relationship between the two at @entity147 's @entity146 in @entity148			2
" the links are getting stronger and stronger and that is partly commercial			0
" music is pumped out to encourage chanting and singing and there is a sense that , for example , football clubs are intruding into what was once a fairly spontaneous part of fan culture			2
" records of chanting at football matches go back to the @entity167 , with famous songs such as @entity170 's " @entity169 " and @entity171 's " on the @entity172 " dating to the late 1800s			0
a century earlier , says @entity143 , early books on cricket described a " rambunctious crowd culture , a little like the ( present - day @entity147 supporters ' ) @entity177 "			2
contrast that with an example from 2004 , he says			0
" the @entity180 actually paid someone ( @entity182 fan @entity181 ) $ 16,000 to write chants for different clubs			0
" people said that typified the sterile , corporate atmosphere -- supporters are not trusted to come up with their own songs any more			2
it was an organic relationship in the past , and now things seem terribly forced			0
" indoor sports arenas , in particular , now batter occupants with wall - to - wall music during stoppages in play			0
extreme outdoor pursuits emerged hand - in - hand with a youth culture of music and video , while football teams have been known to play recordings of chants to get a crowd going as sports establish which techniques work , and which simply alienate their fanbase			0
" @entity209 is one way by which sports are now constantly reinventing themselves , " concludes @entity143			0
cowbell in vogue yet diehard ski race fans still stand on a slope and ring bells from a small @entity67 factory , in the tradition of @entity45 farmers			1
and that tradition spreads by the month			0
@entity74 recently packed off a shipment of bells with @entity67 fans heading to the @entity225			2
cycling and triathlon are increasingly the domain of the cowbell			0
tennis racket manufacturers gave away branded versions at the @entity232			0
@entity2 denies any suggestion this last example is a sign that even the cowbell can go corporate			2
" what 's happening is they 're becoming collectible			0
a guy once called me , saying : ' my wife and i just got divorced			0
the wife got the cowbells			2
do you happen to have this one ? this one ? how about this one ? ' " they did n't make a cowbell for @entity248 but they did one for the @entity250 , then for @entity91 , @entity105 , @entity251 and @entity252			0
the @entity252 one is very hard to find			0
" but what we sell is fun			0
that 's what we sell			0
a cowbell is simply an interaction between athlete and spectator			0

cowbells represent a *defiant* clanging in a world of corporate glitz
@entity270 skiing season brings with it sound of bells on slopes of @entity53 and @entity7
noise has become part of global entertainment industry that is 21st century sport
it grew from @entity45 traditions where farmers would take bells along for winter ski racing
