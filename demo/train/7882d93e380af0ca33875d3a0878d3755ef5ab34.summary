all antidepressant drugs are not created equal , according to the authors of one of the few studies that have ever systematically analyzed and compared " new generation " medicines for treating depression			1
what qualities are important in an anti-depressant ? efficacy ? tolerance ? side effects ? cost ? in the analysis of 12 drugs , two came out on top as the most effective and best tolerated as first - line treatments : sertraline ( @entity17 ) and escitalopram ( @entity19 )			1
@entity20 ( @entity20 ) and mirtazapine ( @entity22 ) rounded out the top four for effectiveness , but venlafaxine was also among the four drugs patients were most likely to quit taking because of side effects			1
@entity27 ( @entity27 ) was less effective than the rest			1
while psychiatrists treating depressed patients every day have had a sense of which medications are best , the current study " nails it , " says @entity33 , @entity34 , of the @entity35			0
@entity33 , who wrote a comment accompanying the study that is published in the current issue of @entity42 , says the findings have " enormous implications " because , for the first time , they offer doctors an evidence - based , unbiased way to recommend treatment			2
and , he adds , they give patients a " gold standard of reliable information , " especially since the study 's authors plan to make their findings available free on the @entity55			0
not so fast , says @entity58 , @entity34 , @entity59 , who coauthored a review of the benefits and risks of the same 12 drugs published last november in the @entity64			0
he and his colleagues concluded , based on their review done while @entity58 was at the @entity68 - @entity67 in @entity69 , @entity70 , that there was no clinically meaningful evidence that any one of the drugs was better than the rest			2
instead , they argued , decisions on which drug to use should be based on factors such as cost and side effects			1
in the current study , @entity81 , @entity34 , of the @entity82 in @entity83 , and colleagues used a new technique called multiple - treatments meta - analysis to make head - to - head comparisons among the 12 drugs , incorporating 117 randomized controlled trials including 25,928 patients in all			1
there has been little scientific evidence of the relative effectiveness of these drugs , because most studies compare one against a handful of others or a placebo , and are often funded by the maker of a particular drug , which can bias the findings in its favor , the researchers note			1
@entity104 : how to brighten your winter mood they used two measurements to gauge a drug 's effectiveness and tolerability : the percentage of patients who showed at least a 50 percent improvement in their symptoms as measured by one of two scales , or who scored " much improved or very much improved " after eight weeks of treatment ( or from six to twelve weeks if eight - week data were n't available ) and the percentage of patients who dropped out of the study before eight weeks for any reason			2
the 12 drugs included bupropion , citalopram , duloxetine , escitalopram , fluoxetine , fluvoxamine , milnacipran , mirtazapine , paroxetine , reboxetine , sertraline , and venlafaxine			0
the authors did not use any funding from drug manufacturers to conduct their study			0
" this is an unbiased approach to combining the maximum possible data and comparing a large number of drugs rather than one versus a select handful , so there 's much more confidence in these findings , " says @entity33			0
basically , @entity33 explains , @entity81 and colleagues were able to make comparisons among drugs that had n't been studied head - to - head by using their effectiveness as compared with @entity155 -- the best studied of these drugs -- as a kind of common currency			1
" there are limitations to the indirect approach used -- nonetheless , we think its the best available at present			0
the analysis will need to be updated regularly to include all new upcoming evidence , " @entity81 and coauthor @entity164 , @entity34 , director of the @entity165 at the @entity166 in the @entity167 , said via e-mail			2
the findings do n't mean that everyone should be put on @entity17 or @entity19 , and they should n't be seen as suggesting that people who are on other drugs should go off them , @entity81 and @entity164 say			0
@entity104 : 3 signs you should stop , adjust , or switch antidepressants while it 's good to have choices available since not everyone will benefit from a particular drug , there also seem to be a lot of " me too " products out there that offer no additional benefit but cost more , the authors add			1
they suggest that future studies should compare new antidepressants with sertraline , rather than to a placebo or a cherry - picked selection of other drugs			1
" requiring new treatments to show either greater efficacy or acceptability than an existing standard therapy would serve as a disincentive to the development of me - too agents that offer little to patients other than increased costs , " they write			2
but according to @entity58 , who is now with the @entity207 in @entity208 , @entity209 , the approach @entity210			0
used has " serious downsides " that they did not acknowledge			0
also , he argues , their use of odds ratios rather than relative risks led to overestimations of the differences among the various drugs			2
@entity104 : head - to - toe solutions for stress " most of these differences are statistically significant , but they 're probably not clinically relevant , " @entity58 said			1
" it 's quite a stretch to say that ... clinically important differences exist between commonly prescribed antidepressants			2
" he and his colleagues did see differences among the drugs in side - effect profiles that could in fact be relevant to patients , @entity58 said , and he argues that the finding that venlaxafine caused more nausea and vomiting while sertraline was associated with diarrhea , as well as the fact that some drugs must be taken several times a day while others can be taken less often , are important considerations , along with cost			1
but for @entity33 , the differences in effectiveness and tolerability that @entity81 identified can make a real difference to patients			0
" the magnitude of these differences is not huge in terms of effectiveness			0
it 's genuine , but it 's modest , " @entity33 said			0
" you can say to a patient , ' do you want the strongest possible drug or do you want the one that 's least likely to give you side effects , or do you want some balance ? ' " @entity265 : boost your mood naturally he added , " it allows a dialogue to say , ' what suits you ? ' and if you 're able to engage a patient in that dialogue , there 's a much better chance of a patient sticking to that treatment because they 've been able to tailor that treatment to their individual preference			1

according to analysis of " new generation " antidepressants , some are more effective
since few head - to - head studies exists , researchers used @entity155 as *benchmark*
cost , side effects should be considered as well , argues another *reseacher*
