@entity0 began as the home of an ancient empire and grew into a massive , modern metropolis			1
with more than 20 million people pulsing through its streets , it 's one of the world 's largest cities			1
that big - city bustle brings with it delicious food , massive markets and more cultural events in a day than anyone can ever keep track of			2
there 's lavish wealth , devastating poverty and a lot to discover in @entity0 's sprawling capital : 1			1
looking to set a quirky record ? @entity0 might be the world 's best place to do it			1
one big perk of having so many people in the same place : it 's easy to set a record if you can persuade enough of them to do the same thing at the same time			1
records for the most people kissing simultaneously ( 39,879 ) , the most people dancing to @entity35 's " @entity34 " at the same time ( 13,597 ) and the world 's biggest enchilada ( weighing nearly 1.5 tons ) have all been set inside the @entity42 capital , according to @entity39			1
gays and lesbians are welcome			0
for years , @entity46 's deep - rooted ties to the @entity47 meant much of the region tended to take a more conservative tack when it came to homosexuality			1
but that 's started to shift in recent years , and @entity0 has been at the forefront			1
same - sex marriage is legal there			2
so is adoption by same - sex couples			2
and the city has marketed itself as a destination for gay tourists			0
in 2010 , the city offered a free honeymoon to @entity46 's first gay couple to wed. 3			2
you might have heard about the smog			2
they 're working on it			0
pollution in @entity0 used to be so bad that children painting pictures of the sky reportedly would color it gray , not blue			1
because of its geographic location -- in a valley between mountains -- and the sheer number of cars traveling its streets , smog is a problem the city is still battling			2
but with government programs that encourage bike - riding and limit the number of days motorists can take to the streets , longtime residents say the pollution problem is much better than it used to be			2
another innovative solution debuted last year : a hospital tower covered with a facade designed to " eat smog , " breaking down pollutants when the sun hits it			2
designers say the tiles on the facade of the @entity97 neutralize the effects of 1,000 cars every day			0
the city was built on a lake			0
it 's hard to imagine now , but much of the sprawling concrete jungle that now makes up @entity0 was once a large lake			1
the @entity104 constructed a massive civilization there , with @entity107 serving as the capital			0
that city , which started out on an island and expanded to include reclaimed parts of the lake , thrived until the @entity114 conquest			0
after winning the battle for control of the area in 1521 , @entity115 destroyed @entity107 and built @entity0 on top of its ruins , using canals and roads from the @entity104 city as the basis for new streets and eventually draining the lake			1
but they did n't entirely erase the past			0
that 's made for some fascinating ancient finds as @entity0 grew into a modern urban metropolis			1
in 1978 , electrical company workers digging near the city 's central square came upon an @entity104 relic			2
that led to archaeologists unearthing ruins of the @entity138 , an @entity104 temple that 's now a popular tourist destination in @entity0			1
it turns out the dried - out bed of a big lake is n't the best foundation for building construction			2
if you want proof , take a look at some of @entity0 's most iconic structures			1
the sloped floor and a swinging pendulum inside the @entity153 show that the building is decidedly tilted			0
@entity155 to the @entity156 , and you 'll need to walk up steps that the city built over the years as the area around the 1910 monument sank			2
government officials have estimated that the city is sinking at a rate of 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) per year			0
a recent government report ( @entity165 ) estimated that @entity0 has sunk 10 meters ( 32.8 feet ) in the past 60 years			1
one of the world 's richest men lives here			1
@entity42 telecom mogul @entity168 topped @entity170 's list of the world 's richest men for four years			1
@entity173 founder @entity172 reclaimed the no. 1 spot this year			0
but @entity168 and his family , with an estimated net worth of $ 71.4 billion , are still sitting comfortably in second place			0
@entity168 lives in @entity0 , and many of the companies he controls are based there , too			1
even if you 're just passing through the city , you 're bound to come across his holdings			0
talking on a @entity42 cell phone ? it 's pretty likely that it 's tied to @entity168 's company , @entity186 , which controls 70 % of @entity0 's wireless market			1
swinging by a department store ? if you spend any time in @entity0 , you 'll probably find a reason to stop at @entity190 , @entity168 's ubiquitous chain that contains restaurants , pharmacies and retail goods			1
admiring beautiful buildings in the city 's historic center ? @entity168 helped finance a major facelift there in recent years			2
it 's safer than some parts of the country			2
many @entity42 used to fear traveling to their nation 's capital , concerned about crime			1
street assaults and kidnapping are still major worries for residents and visitors			0
and in high - end neighborhoods , you might find a store selling bulletproof glass near a designer clothing boutique			2
but the city 's homicide rate is on par with other major metropolises around the world			1
and with drug violence plaguing other parts of the country , @entity0 has actually earned a reputation as one of the safer places to go			1
it 's not just tacos and tequila			0
do n't expect to find much cheesy @entity232 fare here			0
the @entity0 culinary scene is muy caliente , with fancy restaurants in posh hotels and top chefs saying they come here for inspiration			1
@entity239 , a restaurant in the city 's posh @entity242 neighborhood , ranks among the world 's top eateries			1
but it 's not all about fine dining			0
market stalls and street stands serve up some of the city 's most delicious food			0
if you 're looking for tequila , it 's not hard to get it			0
but if you want to drink like a local , try mezcal or pulque			0
all three drinks are made from agave plants			0
@entity260 comes from blue agave			0
@entity262 can be made from different types of agave plants and has become a popular drink for hipsters in @entity0 's capital			1
so has pulque , a 2,000 - year - old @entity104 drink made from fermented but undistilled agave juice			0
the subway is fast , cheap and fascinating			0
while many businessmen and foreigners who live in the city rely on taxis and car services , @entity0 's metro is still the most popular way to get around for the masses			1
protests after authorities announced plans to raise fees last year were n't successful			0
but taking the subway is still pretty cheap : just 5 pesos ( about 40 cents ) for a ticket			0
and it 's not just a way to get from point a to point @entity291 for some people , stations on the city 's 12 subway lines are a destination			1
there are shops , libraries , art exhibits and even computer labs inside			0
a pedestrian tunnel between two subway stations in the heart of the city boasts more than 40 bookstores			0
it 's not all loud noise and concrete			0
if you need a break from the bustle , it takes only a short subway ride in @entity0 to reach places where you 'll feel like you stepped back in time			1
neighborhoods like @entity314 and @entity315 ( where artists @entity316 and @entity318 made their home ) have cobblestone streets , beautiful buildings and quaint cafes that will give you a chance to catch your breath .			0

@entity0 's metro area is one of the world 's largest , with more than 20 million people
the huge population makes for interesting record - setting
there 's still smog and crime , but it 's not as bad as you think
