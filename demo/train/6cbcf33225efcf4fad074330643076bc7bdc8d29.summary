-- could search crews be just a few hundred feet from solving a mystery that has riveted millions for 76 years ? that 's the question raised by tantalizing evidence published this week by teams trying to find out what happened to famed aviator @entity7 , who vanished along with navigator @entity8 during a doomed attempt to fly around the world in 1937			2
yet that evidence has been met with skepticism in some quarters			2
debate about the mystery gained new currency this week after researchers publicized images recorded by search teams scanning the ocean floor nearly a year ago near @entity21 in the @entity22			2
the @entity23 raised the prospect of a big break in the case by publishing an image online			1
it showed something -- hard for the layman to size up -- on the ocean floor			2
the group said , " it 's the right size , it 's the right shape and it 's in the right place			1
" could it really be a piece of @entity7 's @entity40 plane ? @entity41 , caretaker and historian of the @entity43 in @entity44 , @entity45 , chose her words carefully on friday afternoon			1
" we do n't want to shrug off the hard work anyone is doing			2
we do like the idea that people are still interested , " she said			2
" but we 're skeptical			1
" opinion : will mystery of @entity7 be solved ? she said there have been other theories that have emerged			0
one is that @entity7 's plane was forced down by the @entity57 around the @entity58			1
another is that @entity7 secretly returned to the @entity60 and the government gave her a new identity			0
there are people out there who buy those theories			0
but in reality , @entity41 said , " no one has yet to come up with anything conclusive			1
" it was n't until march that one analyst made a possible connection to @entity7 in an online forum for the @entity23			0
the group said experts have offered various interpretations			1
some think the sonar image could be a man - made object , and others say it could be a geologic feature			1
@entity7 : the evidence we almost lost " so did ( last summer 's ) expedition actually succeed in locating the wreckage of the world 's most famous missing airplane ? or is this sonar target just a coral rock or ridge ? " the organization says on its website			1
" of course we 're not going to know until we can get back out there , but until then the anomaly is worth close study			0
" @entity96 , executive director of the @entity97 , a trade group , said that " almost anything is possible " these days with advanced technology			1
and that includes locating a lost airplane			0
he cited technology such as side - scan sonar and magnetometers but said finding a lost plane such as the @entity7 craft is " more a function of funding than technology			1
" money is needed to invest in expeditions , he said			0
the @entity23 on its website is asking for contributions to continue its work			0
@entity41 said she 's heard all of the evidence and nothing solid has risen to the surface			0
and that includes the latest foray into the @entity22 deep			0
" we do n't expect anything , " she said			0
photo may be key to finding what happened to aviator			0
