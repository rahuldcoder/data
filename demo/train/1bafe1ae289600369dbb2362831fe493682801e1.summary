@entity0 -- imagine playing an intense , high - speed game while tumbling over your teammates			2
now , do it all while holding your breath			0
welcome to the madness of underwater hockey , a decades - old sport that boasts an international following -- but still draws disbelief and chuckles in the @entity12			1
" i think most people hear ( about it ) and think , ' oh that 's not really a sport , ' and brush it off , " said @entity13 of the @entity14 in @entity0			1
" maybe that 's why it 's not heard of as much			2
" far from a joke , underwater hockey combines speed , agility , strength and strategy -- several feet below the nearest oxygen supply			1
the underwater hockey glossary " this is for people who are true athletes , " said @entity30 , @entity31 's teammate			1
at 52 , @entity30 is almost twice the age of @entity35			0
but here , age , size and gender do n't matter			2
the water is the great equalizer			0
playing under pressure play begins when two flipper - donning teams line up along opposite ends of a pool and race toward a puck submerged in the middle			1
some splash and tear across the surface like speed demons , while others disappear immediately underwater			2
if you dive under right away , you might reach the puck first -- only to realize you 're out of oxygen and need to come up for air			2
sprinting across the surface allows you to breathe through a snorkel ; but someone else will probably reach the puck first			2
what happens after the initial face - off can only be described as elegant chaos			2
the neon - finned players flip around and over each other like a sphere of tropical fish circling prey			1
in this bizarre , three - dimensional playing field , attackers can sneak in from above , the side and even underneath			2
at 3 pounds , the puck is about eight times heavier than an ice hockey puck so it can stay grounded underwater			1
but such density , combined with the surrounding water pressure , also makes it that much harder to push with a 12 - inch stick			1
at the bottom , @entity13 whips his body around in a tight circle to defend the puck from swarming opponents			1
" a lot of ( technique ) comes from experience -- asking people , ' how did you do that ? ' and a lot of it is muscle memory , " @entity13 said			1
moments later , as two opponents battle for the puck midwater , @entity93 zips across the pool floor like a caffeinated eel and steals the puck from underneath the players			1
she scores a goal as stunned defenders watch behind goggles			0
silent strategy unlike in other team sports , players ca n't hear what their teammates might say			1
the deep sounds of swooshing water drown everything out			0
" i guess there is no way to communicate in the water			0
you just develop an intuition of what to do when , " said @entity116 , co-founder of the @entity14 team			0
that intuition is particularly important because no single player can swim to the bottom and wage battle without needing to come up for air -- and needing an astute teammate to take over the play			1
" a big part of the strategy is to determine when to go down , and when to come up , " @entity116 said			0
" anticipation is key , especially with the lack of oxygen			0
" in just a few months , he and @entity13 have already established a silent rapport			0
" i know how long @entity116 can hold his breath for , and i know when he 's going up , so i have to go down , " @entity13 said			2
" i have an idea of when my teammates are going to be running out of breath			0
" that makes it pretty hard to check someone against a pool wall			0
but that does n't mean the sport is void of incidental contact			0
@entity13 said he 's suffered plenty of bruises			0
" you get kicked underwater , sometimes you get hit by the puck , " he said			1
" we have mouth guards on the snorkels so if you take a puck in the mouth , you do n't hurt yourself			2
" but @entity93 said the playing environment mitigates any pain			0
" because you 're underwater , the impact of getting hit is almost dulled down			0
" underwater , but still underground despite its relatively low profile in the @entity12 , the sport started almost 50 years ago as a way to keep a @entity164 sea - diving club together during the frigid winter months			1
" the whole club could disintegrate if the members were only able to plod up and down a swimming pool for six months , " founder @entity165 wrote			0
" i had to put something together to keep the branch up to strength for next summer			0
" his desperation spawned octopush , a game with eight players pushing a lead disc underwater			2
the sport later became known as underwater hockey			1
it 's now a fiercely competitive sport in countries such as @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , the @entity186 and @entity187			1
later this month , elite players from 19 countries -- including the @entity12 -- will compete at the @entity190 in @entity191			1
despite its international popularity , underwater hockey has yet to rise to the surface of mainstream sports in the @entity12 -- perhaps because it ca n't draw thousands of spectators like football or basketball			1
" underwater hockey is not a great spectator sport			1
you can not see the game from above water , and good underwater video coverage is difficult , " said @entity201 , a board member with @entity202			0
and , unfortunately , " the game can not be ' picked up ' on the corner lot			1
" but it 's gaining popularity in places like @entity211 , which has a @entity213 program and two city youth programs , @entity201 said			1
@entity215 in @entity216 , @entity217 , has one of the few -- if not only -- high school underwater hockey teams in the country			1
nationwide , roughly 1,000 players participate in about 50 clubs , all of which are co-ed , @entity201 said			0
it took awhile for @entity116 and @entity225 to get the sport going in @entity0			0
exactly two players showed up to the @entity14 team 's first practice : the two founders			2
now their club has a roster of dozens , including @entity30 , a grandfather who won a gold medal in his division during the national championships in @entity237 last year			0
at 52 , he was n't even close to being the oldest competitor on his championship team			0
now @entity30 is bent on becoming the oldest championship player in underwater hockey , which means playing for at least another 24 years			1
" somebody 's got to take that record away from him , " he said			0
in the meantime , he serves as an unofficial ambassador for the sport whenever people ask about his team t - shirt or the bright fins he carries around			2
he said the reactions run the gamut -- from " ' oh you 're kidding me , that 's not a real sport , ' to ' oh , that sounds way cool -- i want to try that ! ' " best places to swim with sharks @entity262 's retractable roofs to protect from weather woes train like a horse jockey @entity267 woman becomes country 's first to conquer @entity269			0

underwater hockey is popular in @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 and @entity187
it 's gaining popularity in the @entity12 , but ca n't be " picked up on the corner lot " like other sports
players try to push a 3 - pound puck at the bottom of a pool into goals
" this is for people who are true athletes , " one player says
