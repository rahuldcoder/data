-- earlier this year , sociologist @entity1 , ph.d. , watched president @entity2 return to his hometown of @entity4 to celebrate his 50th birthday			2
in the days that followed , @entity1 was struck by the amount of media coverage dedicated to a single question : when did @entity2 's hair get so gray ? being president is a demanding job -- especially in times like this -- and it seems plausible that the stress of juggling politics , the economy , and the military could literally take years off a person 's life			2
@entity22 , @entity23 , a doctor at the @entity24 , in @entity25 , even suggested on @entity2 's birthday that presidents age twice as fast as normal while in office			2
but @entity1 , a professor of public health at the @entity31 , was n't buying it			0
wealth , access to healthcare , and education are all closely linked to longer lifespans , and presidents have all three resources in abundance , he reasoned ; if anything , presidents should age slower than the average person			1
@entity0 : 30 stay - healthy tips for men to test his hunch , @entity1 collected the birth , death , and inauguration dates of every @entity51 president that died of natural causes			1
( he also included living presidents			2
) then , based on their time in office , he estimated their projected lifespans under dr. @entity22 's " accelerated aging " theory			1
two - thirds of presidents lived ( or are living ) longer than their projected lifespans , @entity1 found			1
what 's more , two - thirds also made it past the average lifespan of men in their age group			1
" the first eight presidents lived an average of 79.8 years during a time when life expectancy for men was under 40 , " says @entity1 , whose findings were published today in the @entity70			1
" it seems like most presidents live exceptionally long lives			0
" @entity0 : how to live to 100 if that 's the case , what explains the rapidly graying hair and premature wrinkles that seem to beset presidents ? ( @entity2 is n't the only president whose visible aging has attracted attention : in years past , the media has n't failed to note that @entity87 was white - haired by the time he left office , that @entity89 had baggier eyes , and that @entity91 developed new lines across his forehead			1
) the obvious answer is that @entity51 presidents are simply older when they leave the @entity96 as when they enter			1
they also take office in their mid- 50s , on average -- a stage in life when the external signs of aging tend to become more pronounced in men			0
in addition , @entity1 suspects , high levels of stress may indeed contribute to superficial aging , even if they do n't shorten lifespan			0
" there is good , strong literature to suggest that stress can lead to accelerated graying of hair , " he says			0
" there 's no question that stress has a powerful effect , but at least with regard to the presidents , it does n't appear to be making them die sooner			0
" @entity0 : job killing you ? 8 types of work - related stress @entity126 plans to study people in other high - stress jobs -- like @entity129 of insurance companies -- to test whether stress really does influence how old they look			0
either way , he says , @entity2 and other stressed - out workers should n't fret over their appearance			0
" no one dies from gray hair and wrinkles , " he says			0
