@entity10 grew up in @entity8 and @entity14 across the border in @entity20 , and says violence is now a normal part of life on the border			1
" every time you have a conversation here violence is brought up			0
it 's on the front page , it 's part of everyone 's life , it 's a reality			2
i decided to use a piñata because it 's a way to identify with my culture , " @entity10 said in a phone interview			2
the collection , which @entity10 describes as post modern conceptualism , contains four individual piñata sculptures in the shape of cartoon heads a bit larger than life size			1
the heads look as if they have been severed at the bottom of the neck and they are adorned with red paint and shot wounds on the forehead			1
they are all men -- one has glasses , one a golden tooth , one is smiling , and one has a mustache			0
" they do n't represent anyone in particular , just the violence in the border , " @entity10 said			1
" i got a pressure gun and shot each piñata so it would look like a gunshot			1
i also filled the pressure gun with red paint so it would drip down the face , " @entity10 said			1
the pieces , which took @entity65 six months to complete , were received with mixed emotions			0
" i have had all kinds of responses			0
people like them , they think it 's a great idea			0
people think its offensive , sad , it 's humorous , but people say it 's the truth			0
in art i 've learned that everything everyone says , it 's an opinion , " said @entity10			2
@entity81 spokesman @entity80 said the library had only one official complaint -- a man said he was " very offended " by the pieces			0
the library receives around 1,592 visitors per day			0
" as a person living here in the community , as an artist , this is my opportunity to speak , and it 's tragic			2
my family and friends have had to move , it 's tragic			0
i feel it 's my responsibility as an artist to represent those feelings , " said @entity10			1
@entity101 , spokesman for the @entity20 state of @entity104 's @entity103 said the violence is as brutal as ever			2
" we have anything from one dead a day to six or seven			0
criminal groups have changed their strategy			0
they used to operate in high profile vehicles and large caliber weapons , now they use low caliber weapons and older model compact vehicles which are harder to detect , " said @entity101			0
@entity104 's @entity103 oversees 7,000 @entity20 soldiers operating in @entity14 working alongside 2,300 federal police and local police forces			2
