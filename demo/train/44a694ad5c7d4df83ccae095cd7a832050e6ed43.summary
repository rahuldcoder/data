@entity0 -- in direct and emotional terms , president @entity2 informed the nation and the world sunday night that a @entity7 operation in @entity8 earlier in the day killed @entity10 leader @entity9 almost 10 years after terrorist attacks that killed thousands			1
" i can report to the @entity7 people and to the world that the @entity7 has conducted an operation that killed @entity9 , the leader of @entity10 , and a terrorist who 's responsible for the murder of thousands of innocent men , women and children , " the president said , looking directly into the television camera in the @entity15 of the @entity16 for the statement broadcast nationwide on short notice			1
it was a triumphant moment for @entity2 and @entity7 security forces , particularly an intelligence community that has been maligned for its failure to head off the 2001 attacks and subsequent breakdowns in cohesion			1
" on nights like this one , we can say to those families who lost loved ones to @entity10 's terror : justice has been done , " @entity2 declared			1
he called @entity9 a mass murderer and said that " his demise should be welcomed by all who believe in peace and dignity			1
" as he spoke , top officials including vice president @entity49 , secretary of state @entity50 , cia director @entity51 and @entity52 chairman adm. @entity53 looked on in the @entity15			0
" for over two decades , @entity9 has been @entity10 's leader and symbol and has continued to plot attacks against our country and our friends and allies , " @entity2 said			1
" the death of @entity9 marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation 's effort to defeat @entity10			1
" the president described the intelligence process that culminated in acquiring actionable information on @entity9 's whereabouts in recent months			1
" last august , after years of painstaking work by our intelligence community , i was briefed on a possible lead to @entity9 , " @entity2 said			1
" it was far from certain			0
and it took many months to run this thread to ground			0
i met repeatedly with my national security team as we developed more information about the possibility that we could locate @entity9 hiding within a compound deep inside @entity8			2
" according to senior administration officials , @entity2 chaired five @entity85 meetings in recent months , with the two most recent ones on april 19 and april 28 , before giving the order friday -- a day he spent in @entity88 visiting storm - damaged areas of the state -- to proceed with the mission			2
last week , @entity2 said , " i determined that we had enough intelligence to take action and authorized an operation to get @entity9 and bring him to justice			1
" " today , at my direction , the @entity7 launched a targeted operation against that compound in @entity101 , @entity8 , " the president continued			1
" a small team of @entity7 carried out the operation with extraordinary courage and capability			2
they took care to avoid civilian casualties			0
after a firefight they killed @entity9 and took custody of his body			1
" senior administration officials told reporters on condition of not being identified that the surgical strike involved a helicopter raid on the heavily secured compound that lasted less than 40 minutes			0
the @entity7 forces engaged in a firefight with @entity9 and others that killed five people -- @entity9 , three male accomplices and a woman whom one of the male combatants used as a human shield , the officials said			1
one @entity7 helicopter crashed due to a mechanical problem and was destroyed , the officials added			2
in his remarks , @entity2 recounted the 2001 terrorist attacks , referring to the clear blue skies that day and the horror of planes slamming into the @entity134 and the @entity135			2
he also spoke of families who lost loved ones that day , the intelligence community that finally tracked @entity9 down , and " the men who carried out this operation			2
" " it was nearly 10 years ago that a bright september day was darkened by the worst attack on the @entity7 people in our history , " @entity2 said			1
" the images of 9/11 are seared into our national memory -- hijacked planes cutting through a cloudless september sky ; the @entity134 collapsing to the ground ; black smoke billowing up from the @entity135 ; the wreckage of flight 93 in @entity155 , @entity156 , where the actions of heroic citizens saved even more heartbreak and destruction			0
" he went on to describe the worst images -- " those that were unseen to the world			0
" " the empty seat at the dinner table			0
children who were forced to grow up without their mother or their father			0
parents who would never know the feeling of their child 's embrace			0
nearly 3,000 citizens taken from us , leaving a gaping hole in our hearts , " @entity2 said			2
" tonight we give thanks to the countless intelligence and counterterrorism professionals who have worked tirelessly to achieve this outcome , " @entity2 said			2
" the @entity7 people do not see their work nor know their names , but tonight they feel the satisfaction of their work and the result of their pursuit of justice			0
" thanking the @entity7 forces in sunday 's operation , @entity2 said they " exemplify the professionalism , patriotism and unparalleled courage of those who serve our country			1
and they are part of a generation that has borne the heaviest share of burden since that september day			0
" " let me say to the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 , that we have never forgotten your loss , nor wavered in our commitment to see that we do whatever it takes to prevent another attack on our shores , " he said			0
" and tonight , let us think back to the sense of unity that prevailed on 9/11			0
i know that it has , at times , frayed			0
yet today 's achievement is a testament to the greatness of our country and the determination of the @entity7 people			2
" @entity2 also repeated the longstanding @entity7 contention that originated with former president @entity221 after the 2001 attacks that the fight against @entity224 was not a war against @entity226			1
" i 've made clear , just as president @entity221 did shortly after 9/11 , that our war is not against @entity226 , " @entity2 said			1
" @entity9 was not a @entity230 leader			0
he was a mass murderer of @entity230			0
indeed , @entity10 slaughtered scores of @entity230 in many countries including our own			0

president @entity2 tells the nation that a @entity7 operation killed @entity9
@entity2 : @entity9 's death should be welcomed " by all who believe in peace and dignity "
the president reiterates that the @entity7 war against @entity10 is not a war on @entity226
