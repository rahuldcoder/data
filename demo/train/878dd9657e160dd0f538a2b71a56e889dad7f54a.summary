fragments of humans ' ancient relatives are scattered across the globe			1
sometimes a tooth or a few bones are all we have to tell us about an entire species closely related to humans that lived thousands or millions of years ago			0
so when anyone finds a complete skull of a possible human ancestor , paleoanthropologists rejoice			1
but with new knowledge comes new controversy over a fossil 's place in our species ' very fuzzy family tree			0
in the eastern @entity25 nation of @entity26 , a group of researchers has excavated a 1.8 million - year - old skull of an ancient human relative , whose only name right now is @entity31			1
they report their findings in the journal @entity35 , and say it belongs to our genus , called @entity39			0
" this is most complete early @entity39 skull ever found in the world , " said lead study author @entity40 , researcher at the @entity41 in @entity42			1
skull 5 is the fifth example of a hominid -- a bipedal primate mammal that walked upright -- from this time period found at the site in @entity50 , @entity26			2
stone tools and animal bones have also been recovered from the area			0
the variation in physical features among the @entity50 hominid specimens is comparable to the degree of diversity found in humans today , suggesting that they all belong to one species , @entity40 said			0
but " if you will put separately all these five skulls and five jaws in different places , maybe people will call it as a different species , " he said			2
now it gets more controversial : @entity40 and colleagues also propose that these individuals are members of a single evolving homo erectus species , examples of which have been found in @entity75 and @entity76			1
the similarities between the new skull from @entity26 and @entity80 remains from @entity81 , @entity82 , for example , may mean there was genetic " continuity across large geographic distances , " the study said			2
what 's more , the researchers suggest that the fossil record of what have been considered different @entity39 species from this time period -- such as @entity92 , @entity93 and homo habilis -- could actually be variations on a single species , homo erectus			1
that defies the current understanding of how early human relatives should be classified			1
because of @entity31 and the other @entity50 fossils , scientists are " rethinking what happened in @entity75 , " @entity40 said			1
the @entity50 individuals appear to have long legs and short arms , based on the fossils that have been found , said study co-author @entity108 , of the @entity109 at the @entity110 , @entity111 , at a press conference			2
the braincase of @entity31 is 546 cubic centimeters , which is smaller than expected			0
the biggest brain case found at @entity50 is 75 % larger than the smallest one , which is consistent with what is observed in modern humans , said study co-author @entity119 of the @entity109 in @entity120			0
at @entity50 , researchers believe carnivores and hominids were fighting over animal carcasses			0
the stone tools appear to have been used in butchering , based on the cut marks on animal bones , @entity40 said			0
they are comparable to tools that have been found in @entity75			2
" it 's a real snapshot in time , " @entity40 said of the @entity50 site			2
@entity31 , excavated in 2005 , was matched to a jaw discovered in 2000			0
the first example of a hominid fossil at @entity50 was discovered in 1991			0
so what species came after @entity80 in the history of human relatives ? scientists have no idea , @entity119 said			1
" it would be nice to say this is the last common ancestor of @entity143 and us , but we simply do n't know , " @entity119 said			0
the @entity50 fossils are a great find , say anthropology researchers not involved with the excavation			0
but they 're not sold on the idea that this is the same @entity80 from both @entity75 and @entity76 -- or that individual @entity39 species from this time period are really all one species			1
" the specimen is wonderful and an important contribution to the hominin record in a temporal period where there are woefully too few fossils , " said @entity151 , paleoanthropologist at the @entity152 in @entity153 , in an e-mail			2
but the suggestion that these fossils prove an evolving lineage of @entity80 in @entity76 and @entity75 , @entity161 said , is " taking the available evidence too far			1
" @entity161 led the team that discovered @entity167 , a possible human ancestor that lived around 2 million years ago in @entity75			1
he criticized the authors of the new study for not comparing the fossils at @entity50 to @entity167 or to more recent fossils found in @entity173			1
ancient fossils question human family tree @entity40 said he and colleagues consider a. sediba to be earlier and more primitive than the @entity50 hominids , and that there 's " no doubt " the @entity41 fossils belong to the @entity39 genus			1
but the selectivity of fossils compared to them in this study may have artificially biased the results toward the researchers ' hypotheses , @entity161 said			2
@entity190 , curator emeritus at the @entity192 's anthropology division , said in an e-mail that there 's " no way this extraordinarily important specimen is @entity80 , " if the skull fragment discovered in @entity196 , @entity81 , @entity82 , defines the features of the homo erectus group			1
the @entity203 museum 's @entity201 takes visitors on a tour through human evolutionary history , showing distinct @entity39 species reflected in major fossil finds such as @entity209 ( homo ergaster ) and @entity211 ( @entity80 )			1
the @entity50 discovery may find a place there too , but it 's probably not going to result in relabeling other species , @entity190 said			0
" right now i certainly would n't change the @entity201 -- except to add the specimen , which really is significant , " he said			0
there is an area of about 50,000 square meters at @entity50 still to be excavated , so @entity31 5 may have even more company			0
ancient creature had spider - like brain follow @entity221 on @entity222 at @ lizlandau .			0

1.8 million - year - old fossils are a " snapshot in time , " researcher says
fossils call into question the classification of distinct species of ancient human relatives
study authors argue there was one homo erectus lineage that left @entity75 for @entity238
other anthropologists do n't *buy* the argument but say skull is important
