-- when i was a child i had an illustrated chart of all the kings and queens of @entity5 on my bedroom wall			0
i loved that poster : there was moody @entity14 sighing over burnt cakes , fat , arrogant @entity8 , queen elizabeth i with her inscrutable half - smile , @entity11 hiding in the tree			2
they were live and vivid stories of heroism , frailty , failure , fealty , attached to real ruins that real families ( including ours ) seemed to trudge off to engage with at weekends -- thanks to the @entity27			2
to me they were a kind of half - fantasy			2
factually real , but entirely constructed in my imagination			0
no wonder then , that historical novels have such an enduring appeal -- the latest blockbuster on the life of @entity36 is about to hit our shelves			0
for the writer imagining what it must have been " really like " back then is a huge part of the appeal			0
the late author @entity44 called the royal family our " national fetish			1
" shrunk now from the awesome @entity49 kingdoms , the current royal family now has a largely " soft " social and tabloid power , and any negative mention of the royals , especially by someone who has been as handsomely rewarded as @entity54 by the establishment , is met with screams of utter hysterical disapproval			1
read more : author 's description of @entity60 as ' machine - made ' doll sparks angry reactions if you read the original article it 's an erudite , writerly essay that speculates about the national drama that is the royal family , and acknowledges -- much like the spectacle that is playing out at the @entity69 -- that the royal family is pure theater with real living human beings playing out these arcane rituals stuck in the middle			1
@entity54 is not actually calling @entity75 a " jointed doll , " she is suggesting that the duchess 's public image -- the role she plays in the collective psyche -- has overtaken the real person , much like it did with @entity82 , @entity83			1
but the fact that the @entity85 and other conservative commentators have broken out in such a bad case of shrill hysteria in the face of this examination of the author 's mixed feelings about the royal family is quite amusing , actually , because it sounds so utterly insincere			1
aside from the fact that @entity75 is pregnant and the @entity85 needs to keep her in the headlines , such is their fawning need to be seen as the courtiers - in - chief , there is also a question of why @entity54 's essay has caused such a fuss			1
it 's almost like someone has just told all the children that @entity104 is not real			0
@entity105 is merely pointing out that @entity60 is not really a duchess , just a woman who agreed through marriage to play this role , which few would wish to have for all the kingdoms in the world -- all that suffocating attention			2
read more : duchess of @entity113 -- from college sweetheart to queen in waiting @entity105 , like all good novelists , understands the power of the imagination to create reality : all she is doing is pointing out the drama that the royal family play out on a national stage			1
we agree as a nation , to believe in the royal family -- why ? because we always have ? this is the really interesting question and the one that @entity105 was asking			1
that she should be met with such opprobrium for asking it suggests something interesting about the national psyche			0
in the absence of any real national culture the royal family is increasingly the obsession of the @entity5 -- the @entity136 and the @entity137 would take independence if they could have it			2
they are expensive , anachronistic , a sentimental link in a chain to a collective history -- a bit like a living breathing monument			0
but the issue about whose nation they represent , and what they are really for remains louder than ever			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			0

award - *winning* novelist @entity105 described the @entity75 as " machine - made "
@entity105 's comments have sparked *criticism* , including from @entity159 prime minister @entity158
@entity161 argues that @entity54 has been *misinterpreted* by a press wanting headlines
she says the novelist was asking why @entity159 needs to " believe in " the royal family
