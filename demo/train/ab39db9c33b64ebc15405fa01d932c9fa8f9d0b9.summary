-- it 's december 23 , so " let 's rumble ! " as last - minute shoppers fueled on eggnog scramble for those final gifts for relatives thrice - removed , there 's another celebration afoot tuesday : @entity9			1
@entity9 was introduced in the ninth and final season of " @entity12 " as a holiday that @entity14 , played by @entity15 , begrudgingly grew up with as an antidote to the season 's growing focus on consumerism			1
while the episode originally aired on december 18 , 1997 , the holiday and its eccentric customs -- like the " feats of strength " and " airing of grievances " -- live on with much fanfare			2
" many christmases ago , i went to buy a doll for my son			0
i reach for the last one they had -- but so did another man			0
as i rained blows upon him , i realized there had to be another way ! " @entity14 's father , @entity37 , played by @entity38 , explained in the episode			0
and so a " @entity9 " was born			1
the @entity40 is rife with @entity9 references this time of year			2
" @entity42 ! " @entity15 exclaimed tuesday on the site			0
" may ur pole be straight , ur feats be strong & your grievances be few			0
with love from the @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity14			0
" @entity9 has even spawned literature like a 2005 guide to the holiday called " @entity9 : the holiday for the @entity55			1
" despite the absurdity of it all , @entity57 writer @entity56 said he , in fact , grew up with this peculiar holiday of his own father 's creation , and the " airing of grievances " into a tape recorder was a real part of it			1
however , the pole and the father - son wrestling match were made for tv			0
" i was not forced to wrestle my father			0
if i had , i would 've been raised by the state of @entity78 , " @entity56 told @entity0 in a 2013 interview about the " feats of strength " that appear in the episode			2
much like @entity14 , @entity56 did n't want the tradition to leave the family circle			1
" i did n't want to put it on tv because it was sort of a family disgrace , " @entity56 joked			1
but when the show 's other writers and @entity57 caught wind of it from @entity56 's brother , majority opinion prevailed			1
fellow writer @entity90 came up with the @entity9 aluminum pole , which fans can now purchase online			1
the real symbol was a clock in a bag nailed to the wall , which @entity56 says his father still has n't explained to him			1
" i thought it was going to be the most forgettable part of it that was cut out for syndication , " @entity56 said			2
instead , the pole and the holiday took on a life of their own			0
and that is a @entity9 miracle			2
