earlier this month , the @entity1 majority leader , @entity0 , rolled out to much fanfare a new " branding effort " for the @entity4 , focused on broadening its appeal and helping the middle class			1
it seemed hopeful at the time			0
sadly , today it is laughable			0
we are days away from severe forced spending cuts that will do nothing but hurt the very people the @entity4 is trying to win over			1
gov. @entity16 of @entity17 recently declared that @entity4 had to stop being " the stupid party " if they were ever going to put together the long - term winning coalition they needs to reach the @entity1 in 2016			2
sorry , governor : your party did n't listen			0
if the forced cuts , known as the sequester , go through , 14,000 teachers could get laid off -- affecting thousands of middle - class families , including many african - american and @entity29 families			1
construction jobs , manufacturing jobs , first - responder jobs -- all well - paying middle - class jobs , will get cut			2
@entity35 : on cuts , @entity36 throws a tantrum domestic violence programs will be slashed as $ 20 million gets cut from the @entity40			2
public safety in many ways will suffer			0
food inspectors will get laid off			0
up to 5,000 @entity45 agents will be called from the border -- the mother of ironies for the @entity4 who complain that the administration is n't doing enough on border security			2
this is not what was supposed to happen			0
sequestration was designed to be a bipartisan stink bomb so noxious to both parties that neither would allow it to happen			0
it was a release valve that allowed the parties to reach a deal on the debt limit in the summer of 2011 to avoid sending the nation into default , with the understanding that a broader agreement on the debt and deficit would be reached			0
if it was n't , off went the bomb			0
what happened between then and now ? president @entity70 won reelection by voters who support his idea of dealing with the debt and deficit -- by asking everyone to put some skin in the game			1
he was seen as the protector of the middle class , and importantly , as the one who understood that government is not the enemy			1
that in fact , a lean , efficient , smart government , can help level the playing field and help all @entity86 and businesses get ahead			0
opinion : cuts too deep ? no , not deep enough this argument was overwhelmingly supported by @entity90 , african - americans , women and young people and helped propel the president to a second term			2
then came the fiscal - cliff debacle , where again , majorities of @entity86 sided with the president on how to fix it			0
republicans acquiesced , and it seemed they knew they had to change their tune			0
in his @entity4 rebranding speech , @entity0 said : " we will advance proposals aimed at producing results in areas like education , health care , innovation and job growth			1
" that sounded smart enough			0
but in this current showdown du jour , @entity4 have proven they are unserious			2
the party can not see beyond its insistence on protecting the rich from paying even a single penny more , while welcoming draconian cuts to programs that hurt the middle class and the most vulnerable , especially in the areas of education , health care , innovation and job growth			1
@entity125 : if spending is cut , @entity4 will get the blame instead of trying to find a way to avoid these steep cuts , and to keep faith with their newfound concern for the middle class , @entity4 are doubling down on the " my way or the highway " mentality that put them in an electoral hole to begin with			1
the party 's deficit among these key voting groups will only get bigger if the @entity4 allows the spending cuts to go through			1
the risk to their standing among the @entity146 people is quite real			0
they are making a choice to protect loopholes for millionaires and their corporate jets while kicking 70,000 kids off critical @entity154 programs -- and many of these kids come from low - income @entity146 and @entity29 families			0
thousands of middle - class @entity146 jobs are on the chopping block because the @entity4 did not learn the lesson of the election			1
while there is political risk for everyone , including @entity70 , if these cuts happen , he enjoys something the @entity4 does not : the trust of the @entity146 people			1
recent polling suggests up to half of @entity86 would blame @entity4			1
less than a third would blame president @entity70			1
polls also show that an overwhelming 76 % of voters , and 56 % of @entity4 , agree with the president that the solution to our fiscal woes should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases			1
@entity70 's approval rating is at 55 % , a three - year high			1
he is at 73 % of support with @entity90 , up 2 points from his 71 % election victory -- not a promising trend for @entity4			2
when you are in a hole , the best advice is to stop digging			0
the @entity4 seems to prefer to grab a bigger shovel .			2

@entity196 : *looming* cuts make @entity0 's strategy to draw middle class to @entity4 laughable
she says forced *budget* cuts will hurt thousands of the very people @entity4 wants to attract
she says voters elected @entity70 to boost programs all *threatened* by cuts
@entity196 : @entity70 approval rating high . not so @entity4 's . if cuts happen , voters will blame @entity4
