@entity0 -- some @entity2 spent friday night worrying about their next mortgage payment			2
many prayed for loved ones serving in @entity6 and @entity7			2
others continued to clean up spilled oil in the @entity2 @entity10			2
@entity11 , meanwhile , was tooling around the @entity12 with a male friend in a black @entity14 , until a traffic cop thought he smelled marijuana and pulled them over			1
as the incident unfolded , passing cars slowed down and a crowd of about 100 gathered to take photos and witness @entity22 make news yet again			2
just before a supervised bathroom break at the @entity25 , @entity22 asked to get lip balm from her purse			0
as she opened the purse , an officer noticed a " small bindle " in a " clear baggy " fall out , according to the police report			0
@entity22 , who was arrested on suspicion of possessing less than a gram of cocaine , said the purse and powdery substance were not hers , the report says			0
this was not the 29 - year - old heiress socialite 's first brush with the law			0
media outlets , bloggers and @entity47 pundits will surely scrutinize the arrest in great detail and speculate for days to come about whether it will be her last			0
with all the problems the world faces -- climate change , terrorism , economic malaise and more -- why do we care so much about celebrities such as @entity22 getting into trouble ? " in the last four years 28,000 people have been killed in a country that shares our border , and the country that is supposed to be our safest ally in the @entity68 has now got 20 million displaced people , '' said @entity60 , a former child actor in the 1970s sitcom " @entity62 , " referring to the drug wars in @entity71 and recent floods in @entity73			1
" the news is bad			0
who wants to know that when we can watch @entity80 drown in a sea of @entity83 ? " said @entity60 , host of his own radio talk show on 94.1 @entity77 in @entity78			1
from @entity22 to @entity86 to @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89 to @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94 and even going all the way back to @entity96 , the appetite for celebrity misbehavior seems insatiable			1
these days , @entity2 and cultures around the world never get bored of dishing on celebrity mayhem and may even prefer it to pondering more pressing matters			1
" it 's just way more fun than facing what is actually happening out there , '' said @entity60 , 51 , who openly speaks about the '' mountains of drugs '' he has done over the years and the times he was caught on the wrong side of the law			0
people have always been captivated by royalty and celebrities are the new royalty , says @entity114 , an author and host of " issues " on @entity117			1
but there 's a darker side to focusing on misfortunes of the rich and famous and the thrill that comes with it , says @entity114 , who writes and often speaks about her successful battle with years of alcoholism			0
" i think there 's a certain perverse satisfaction that everyone experiences when they see somebody who has everything -- money , fame , power , good looks , the world at their feet -- and yet it seems like they 're just as miserable as the guy next door or even oneself			0
'' @entity22 , better known as @entity22 and somewhat famous in his own right as a celebrity blogger , compares the compulsion to follow celebrity mischief to rubbernecking during a car accident			1
" it 's on a bigger scale and more people can see it , therefore more people are prone to slow down			1
'' the main point is familiarity , says @entity152 , a professor of popular culture at @entity154			1
when strangers gossip they often need a more common bond than friends or family can provide , @entity152 says			1
" i do n't know your @entity159 and you do n't know my relative who 's in trouble so there 's no kind of connection there , '' @entity152 said			1
" we can talk about the latest tape from @entity86			1
he 's all of our relatives			0
he 's all of our crazy @entity171			0
'' watching celebrities fall from grace or go wild makes the rest of us feel better about ourselves , says @entity176 , a @entity0 - based standup comedian			2
" it 's just that we like feeling better than them			0
we live these kind of mundane , lame lives or at least that 's how we feel most of the time , '' said @entity176 , 25			0
'' then when somebody [ famous ] curses off their girlfriend or somebody ends up in rehab or somebody gets a @entity189 all of a sudden we 're like , ' well , i did n't mess up my life that much			0
'' ' still , fame carries privilege , and sometimes the ability to get away with more than the average person			0
the fact that celebrities are much harder to replace in their work than a janitor or computer technician , for example , could be a key reason they may not pay the full price for misbehaving , according to a 2004 @entity206 study by @entity207			2
but there 's no red carpet treatment for @entity47 on its own turf , according to the @entity211 , which handles its fair share of famous people flouting the law			1
" from a law enforcement perspective , we treat everyone the same , '' says officer @entity215 , a spokesperson for the @entity211			1
" when an arrest becomes a media event , the @entity211 deploys sufficient resources to ensure the safety of the public and the individual			1
" while it 's clear millions like to kick back by picking up the latest magazines , clicking on countless blogs and watching tv shows rehash celebrity antics , is this form of escapism safe ? yes , but in moderate doses , says @entity233 , a @entity0 clinical psychologist who teaches at @entity234			2
" if you do something that is much more related to your own life rather than comparing yourself to someone else , then that would be the highest rung of healthiness , '' @entity233 says			0
" going to a museum , learning a new sport , taking up a new hobby , going to a cooking class -- any of those things certainly are healthier than looking at someone else 's life , whether it 's your neighbor or a celebrity			2
