-- they lined up hundreds strong to touch the dirt			1
some fell to their knees , clutching the gritty stuff as though it were a long - lost child			0
others lifted it to their lips to savor a taste of the home they left behind decades ago			0
exiles -- who face never returning to @entity14 as long as it is under @entity16 rule -- stood on @entity18 soil this week , fulfilling a desire that has burned within since they fled westward across the @entity21			1
only , this week , they were able to do it in @entity24 , the @entity25 hilltown that functions as the de facto capital of the refugee community			1
the display was the work of @entity31 artist @entity30 , 29 , who clandestinely trucked in sacks containing 22 tons of dirt from @entity14 to @entity24 to construct his installation			1
he did not want to disclose details of the soil 's journey , fearful of the repercussions of the act of smuggling			2
all he would say is that it was a " complicated process that took 17 months			0
" @entity30 then spread the dirt over a stage the size of a basketball court and called it " our land , our people			1
" he invited @entity18 to walk on his dirt , write on it or pick up a microphone to express themselves			1
he knew it could never be the same as actually returning to @entity14 , but perhaps , he thought , it would spark a sliver of that feeling			2
he thought of his father on wednesday when the installation opened and people lined up , many overwhelmed with emotion			0
the only wish his father had was to see @entity14 one more time			1
but he fell ill in 2007 and died			0
a father 's unfulfilled wish drove his artist son to create something that would allow the displaced to be able to " return " home again			1
and others like him , who were born outside of @entity14 , to finally feel native earth they have never had under their feet			1
" there are so many like my father who wanted to return , " @entity30 said			1
" and many more who have never been to @entity14			2
" @entity74 , 31 , remembers receiving cell phone texts at 4:30 in the morning when his excited friend first came up with his idea			0
the message was so long that it got broken into three			0
" he was saying he had this idea to transport a large amount of soil from @entity14 , " @entity74 said			1
" i was blown away			0
my first reaction was : how is that possible ? " but then @entity74 began visualizing the project and how much of an impact it was sure to have on @entity18 exiles			2
" the implications , " he said , " seemed historic			0
" known as the " roof of the world , " @entity14 is a remote @entity92 region governed by @entity16			2
@entity93 claims its sovereignty over @entity14 goes back centuries and views the @entity18 spiritual leader , the @entity96 , as a separatist			1
about 150,000 @entity18 live in exile , a majority of them in @entity24 , according to their governing body			2
the @entity96 set up residence there after @entity16 forces crushed a 1959 @entity18 uprising			2
the @entity96 summoned @entity30 to his residence after the opening of the installation wednesday , @entity30 said			2
@entity30 carried with him some of the @entity18 dirt			1
using his index finger , the @entity96 , wrote @entity14 in the dirt and blessed the soil			1
meanwhile , monks in their flowing maroon and saffron robes queued up , as did parents holding babies			0
" it was very exciting , " said @entity116 , 22 , a monk who was a baby when his family left @entity14			2
he touched the dirt and felt a connection like no other			0
" i felt i was back in my own country , " he said			0
@entity123 , 17 , has never been to @entity14 -- he was born and raised in @entity25			1
he has longed to go to @entity14 , feel the air there , drink the water , see the land that possesses his soul			0
" today , ( @entity129 ) made it a little bit possible , " @entity128 said			0
for @entity133 , 35 , a @entity134 visiting family in @entity24 , the installation was bittersweet			0
it was completely inspiring at one moment and in another , as she watched elderly tibetans fall to the ground , sadness overcame her			0
" i am normally better with words than this , " she said , unable to complete her sentence			0
there was no overt political statement in @entity30 's art , but some @entity18 hoped it would inspire resistance to @entity16 rule			1
@entity16 blames @entity18 unrest on the exiled community			0
but no matter the consequences , @entity30 's art will carry on			1
the installation will stay up until friday			0
but when it closes , @entity18 exiles will be allowed to take some of the dirt with them , a reminder always of the land they long to see .			1

tibetans who long to see their *homeland* were able to touch native soil again
artist @entity30 smuggled the soil in sacks from @entity14 to @entity25
the dirt was spread on a stage so @entity18 could walk on it
@entity30 's father died without ever seeing @entity14 again
