frightening government overreach or valuable law enforcement tool ? that 's the question politicians in @entity4 , and millions of citizens around the @entity6 , asked thursday thanks to a jolting report suggesting the government has been collecting millions of @entity6 ' phone records			1
@entity11 direct @entity10 will be asked about the matter -- revealed after a @entity14 newspaper , the @entity9 , published a @entity16 ( @entity16 ) court order that applied to phone data from @entity18 -- when he appears next week before the @entity19			0
the panel 's chairman @entity20 , @entity22 , issued a statement thursday saying he was " very concerned that the @entity24 may have abused the intent of the law , and we will investigate			1
" reports : @entity6 spy agencies mined @entity31 data the report will also be the subject of an upcoming classified briefing by attorney general @entity35 to the @entity36			1
its chairman , sen. @entity37 , is calling for a similar closed - door briefing for the entire @entity40			1
when she read the news thursday morning , the @entity42 @entity41 said , " it was like , ' oh , @entity45 , not one more thing ... where we 're trying to protect @entity6 and then it looks like we 're spying			1
' " what does the @entity18 order mean for me ? an author of the @entity54 -- the legislation used to justify the program -- added he is " extremely disturbed by what appears to be an overbroad interpretation of the act			2
" " these reports are deeply concerning and raise questions about whether our constitutional rights are secure , " rep. @entity60 , @entity61 , wrote in a letter to @entity35			0
but not everyone in the nation 's capital is outraged or even concerned			2
some say the real travesty would be if the program , which they describe as valuable , is halted			2
sen. @entity73 , chairwoman of the @entity74 , said the @entity9 story refers to a " three - month renewal of what has been the case for the past seven years " -- so that while the uproar may be new , the program is not			1
in that time , it 's helped to disrupt " terrorist plots " on @entity6 soil , she said			1
" it is lawful , " the @entity83 @entity41 insisted			0
" it has been briefed by @entity86			0
" rep. @entity90 ( @entity91 ) and rep. @entity92 ( @entity93 ) , two key members of the @entity89 , both stressed that " this important collection tool does not allow the government to eavesdrop " and that it is routinely reviewed by @entity86			2
@entity97 spokesman @entity96 also made those points , adding president @entity102 " put in place a stronger regime of oversight " when he took office			2
he further stressed the importance of ensuring " we have the tools we need to confront the threat posted by terrorists ( and to ) protect the homeland			0
" " that is his top priority , " @entity96 said of domestic security			1
" but ... we need to balance that priority with the need to protect civil liberties and constitutional rights of @entity6 people			1
and that is the subject of a worthy debate			0
" what 's been happening , and for how long ? in 2006 , it was reported the @entity123 was secretly collecting telephone records in an effort to root out terror plots			1
" @entity18 's wireless and wireline companies did not provide to @entity123 customer records or call data , local or otherwise , " the company said at the time			2
like the @entity11 and the @entity123 , @entity18 declined comment to the media thursday on the @entity9 report			0
but company vice president @entity137 , in a note to employees , did say the newspaper 's story may spur the company to respond in defiance of a promise of secrecy			2
the newspaper published the four - page , top - secret government order requiring " originating and terminating " phone numbers plus the location , time and duration of calls from the communications giant			2
it lets the @entity11 and @entity123 to obtain the records from april 25 to july 19			0
7 things to know the order applies to @entity18 , an operation not described on the company 's website			2
its scope was not immediately clear , though the @entity9 claimed " millions of @entity6 customers of @entity18 " were affected by the collection of information " regardless of whether they are suspected of wrongdoing			1
" in his letter to @entity18 employees , @entity137 said that his company would not provide the contents of any communications " or the name , address or financial information of a subscriber or customer			0
" an @entity102 administration official said any such order would relate " exclusively to metadata , such as a telephone number or the length of a call			2
" this kind of information " allows counterterrorism personnel to discover whether known or suspected terrorists have been in contact with other persons who may be engaged in terrorist activities , " the unnamed official said in a statement to media			1
controversy over the @entity9 report comes as the @entity97 fends off privacy complaints on other fronts as well			0
the administration is under fire following revelations the @entity24 seized two months of phone records from @entity202 reporters and editors -- something done as part of an investigation into leaks of classified information			2
@entity209 , the @entity210 and the @entity9 reported that @entity6 intelligence has a broad secret data mining program that allows access to central servers of nine leading @entity6 internet companies -- among them @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 and @entity220 -- to extract e-mail , photos and other private consumer communications			1
director of national intelligence @entity224 challenged the @entity210 and @entity9 reports in a statement thursday night , saying " they contain numerous inaccuracies			2
" specifically , he emphasized the section of the law tied to that reported program " can not be used to intentionally target any @entity6 citizen , any other @entity6 person or anyone located within the @entity6			1
" in statements on that and reports about collecting phone data , @entity224 also called out those behind the apparent leaks -- saying it " will have an impact on the behavior of our adversaries and make it more difficult for us to understand their intentions			0
" speaking specifically about collecting personal phone records , privacy advocates called the practice perilous and claimed it gives authorities access to information of many @entity6 who are n't terrorists			1
in fact , they might not necessarily be @entity18 customers , and similar orders might also apply to other telecommunications companies			0
" there is no indication that this order to @entity18 was unique or novel , " said the @entity262 , which fights to protect privacy			0
" it is very likely that business records orders like this exist for every major @entity6 telecommunication company , meaning that , if you make calls in the @entity6 , the @entity123 has those records			1
and this has been going on for at least seven years , and probably longer			0
" opinion : @entity123 's phone snooping a different kind of creepy @entity280 : ' secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous ' this group is hardly alone			1
the @entity283 called it " beyond @entity285 ( in allowing ) basic democratic rights ( to be ) surrendered in secret to the demands of unaccountable intelligence agencies			0
" the @entity290 blasted it as " the broadest surveillance order to ever had been issued : it requires no level of suspicion			0
" many in president @entity102 's own party spoke forcefully against it as well			0
three @entity299 representatives -- @entity300 of @entity301 , @entity302 of @entity303 and @entity304 of @entity22 -- said the program is " highly problematic and reveals serious flaws in the scope and application of the " @entity54			0
" ( the revelations ) confirm our fears -- that the law would be distorted to allow for ongoing , indiscriminate collection of data , " they wrote			0
sen. @entity315 , who serves on the @entity74 , described the program as " the kind of government overreach i 've said @entity6 would find shocking			1
" one of them : former vice president @entity280			1
" is it just me , or is secret blanket surveillance obscenely outrageous ? " the 2000 @entity299 presidential nominee wrote on @entity322			1
senator says ending program would be ' catastrophic ' opinions were also strong on the other side of the debate			0
" terrorists will come after us if they can , and the only thing that we have to deter this is good intelligence to understand that a plot has been hatched and to get there before they get to us , " said @entity73			1
her intelligence committee 's ranking @entity337 , sen. @entity339 of @entity340 , concurred in stating the program has let authorities gather " significant information on bad guys and only on bad guys over the years			1
" former @entity11 assistant director @entity346 , a @entity348 contributor , said that if a phone number comes up that 's linked to someone suspicious , they can go back and get information tied to that number			0
" it 's not that someone or some group of analysts can sit there and monitor 50 million phone calls going through the computers , " @entity346 explained on @entity348 's " @entity361			0
" " but it would create the ability to go back and see if you could connect phone calls			0
" rep. @entity366 said that , as a @entity18 customer , " it does n't bother me one bit for the @entity123 to have my phone number			0
" the @entity371 @entity337 said he 's confident the government wo n't monitor his and other innocent @entity6 phone calls just because their " number pops up on some terrorist 's phone			1
" " the consequences of taking these tools away from the @entity6 people through their government would be catastrophic , " he said .			1
