-- " ninety percent of the people that live in this holler are coal miners or retired coal miners , " 48 - year - old @entity0 explains as he winds his pickup through the mountains of southern @entity3			1
the rear window of the truck is emblazoned with large decals of a @entity14 truck , a mountain peak and a bulldozer			0
he is a proud coal miner			2
" as far as i can remember , i never dreamed of being anything else , " he says			0
he grew up in tiny @entity19 , @entity3 , where he fished for trout , hunted deer and rode motorbikes around @entity23			0
his extended family still lives here , and he has no intention of leaving			0
" if i were to leave here and go to a city , i would be lost trying to do factory work , " says @entity0 , the son and grandson of coal miners			1
" i 'm not going to say i would n't try , but i probably would n't stay with it			0
" but @entity0 , who loves this quiet , small - town , country life , finds himself in the middle of a loud , high stakes fight between coal companies , politicians , environmentalists and impassioned activists			1
the debate is over mountaintop coal removal , or @entity42			1
see how contentious the battle for @entity23 became @entity44 , a civil and environmental engineer who teaches at @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity3 , explains the process of coal companies cutting off the top of a mountain to remove coal : " they will take hundreds of feet off the top of a mountain to get to a few feet of coal			2
" see the impact of mountain top removal from both sides in 2009 , @entity61 , then the newly appointed administrator of the @entity60 , placed @entity42 permits under review so her agency could determine if the projects would pollute area water			1
" they need to understand , " she says , referring to the coal companies , " yeah you can mine coal , you can give jobs to people , but you ca n't do it at the expense of their lives , their health , their water , their air , that 's too much			1
" since then , nearly all new mountaintop removal permits have been frozen			1
poll : majority oppose mountaintop removal coal mining the environmental agency 's permit review set off a battle for the future of mountaintop mining in @entity3 : the coal industry and its supporters on one side , environmentalists and people concerned about the health effects of mining on the other			1
@entity0 works mainly in mountaintop removal , driving a rock truck and helping rebuild the mountain slopes destroyed by blasting			1
to him , @entity42 permits mean more work			1
no new @entity42 permits means jobs like his will eventually dry up			1
read more about the march on @entity23 @entity108 public health associate professor @entity107 has been studying the health effects of mining in @entity111 for five years			1
" i think it really is the biggest public health problem that @entity3 faces , " he says			2
recent studies he 's published linked " multiple illnesses and multiple health outcomes that are problematic in mining areas			1
higher rates of cancer is one of them			0
higher forms of chronic heart disease , heart attacks , and lung disease like ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ) , kidney disease , " he says			0
" we have found evidence for all of those			0
" but @entity130 , president of the @entity131 and a lobbyist for the coal industry , takes issue with @entity107 's studies			2
" i think what you find is there is a correlation as opposed to a causation and it 's got to be analyzed , " he says			0
he believes the studies raise more questions than answers			0
the answer to this fight in @entity3 might be easier to find if there were other opportunities for men like @entity0			2
" that 's the only jobs in the area , " says @entity0 ' wife , @entity150			1
there are no other jobs in the area for men with his experience and education that would provide his current salary , about $ 65,000 per year			2
activists against mountaintop coal removal often say diversifying @entity3 's economy is a way to increase jobs in the area			1
but the @entity167 believe that is not a short - term solution			0
" there are factories everywhere shutting down , " @entity170 says			0
" what could they put here that would even come remotely close to being what coal and the industry of coal can do for the people of @entity3 ? " the unemployment rate in @entity3 is 8.5 %			0
even if @entity0 was willing to move from southern @entity3 -- he 's not -- recent @entity183 findings say there are nearly five unemployed people for every one job available nationally			2
historian @entity187 , an instructor at @entity188 , believes he has the answer			0
" they can mine the coal around @entity23 and they can get all the coal out without using mountaintop removal , " he says			1
@entity195 prefers underground mining to mountaintop removal and is a leader in the fight to save @entity23 from the mining method			1
the mountain was the site of a massive coal miner uprising in 1921 , one that eventually allowed the coalfields of southern @entity3 to be unionized			0
" they may not make as big a profit ... , " he says , referring to the coal companies , " because they will have to hire more miners			2
" while underground mining jobs do employ about 25 % more miners than aboveground -- or surface mining -- jobs , not all @entity42 projects can be carried out by traditional underground mining			1
sometimes the coal is too close to the peak to be reached safely that way			0
but there is a larger trend : coal jobs in the state are drying up			2
in the 1940s , about 130,000 men made their living by mining " black gold			0
" now that number is around 22,000 , according to the @entity233 government 's @entity231			0
the administration 's projections show that by 2035 , coal production in @entity3 will decrease by 40 % and require thousands fewer miners			2
improved technology has led to the decline			0
so has economics : it 's cheaper and easier to mine in @entity244 , which is now the top coal state , producing 400 million tons a year , four times what 's mined in @entity3			0
so what 's a man like @entity0 supposed to do ? " i 've got to work , " @entity0 says			1
" that is the bottom line , i have got to work			1
" @entity251 and @entity252 contributed to this report .			0

miners like @entity0 say mountaintop removal coal mining preserves jobs
health *researchers* worry about the effects of mining ; the @entity60 has frozen mining permits
environmentalists and historians say the mountains should be preserved
" that is the bottom line , i have got to work , " @entity0 says
