-- the current @entity4 outbreak is " running much faster " than the international response to it , the co-discoverer of the virus said thursday			1
" this is the first @entity4 epidemic where entire nations are involved , where big cities are affected , " @entity7 , a microbiologist and a former undersecretary general of the @entity9 , told @entity11 host @entity10			1
" and i continue to be worried that the response to the epidemic is really running behind the virus			1
" according to the @entity20 's latest update , there have been almost 9,000 confirmed and suspected cases , with almost 4,500 deaths			2
however , the @entity20 warned there could be as many as 10,000 new cases per week in @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 by the end of this year			1
@entity7 , a member of the team that discovered the virus in 1976 in what is now the @entity32 , made headlines earlier this month when he told @entity35 newspaper he feared an " unimaginable catastrophe " if the virus became lodged in a mega-city such as @entity38			1
" the three countries that are affected are being totally destabilized , not only in terms of people who are killed by @entity4 -- their families , the orphans that now are coming up because the parents died -- but the economy has come to a standstill , " @entity7 said thursday , speaking from @entity40			1
" people are massively dying from other diseases that are normally treatable , like malaria , or women die while giving birth because hospitals are abandoned or are full with @entity4 patients			1
so that 's a very , very destabilizing factor , " he said , adding that the impact of its spread is " beyond @entity4			1
" watch the full interview on " @entity11 , " this sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. et on @entity0 @entity7 said that it is impossible to predict the number of cases			1
asked about the @entity20 projections , he said : " 10,000 per week , or 1,000 , we do n't really know			1
" " at the moment , there are about 1,000 , " he said			2
" it 's still expanding , that 's for sure			2
and it probably will continue to grow until all the measures have been put in place in a more efficient way			2
" @entity7 's comments came on the same day as @entity75 , the chief clinical officer for @entity76 , apologized over mistakes he says were made in the care of @entity79 , a @entity26 national who became the first person in the @entity81 to die from the virus			1
@entity79 was sent home despite saying he had a fever and that he had visited @entity85			1
" unfortunately , in our initial treatment of mr. @entity79 , despite our best intentions and a highly skilled medical team , we made mistakes , " @entity75 testified to @entity86			0
" we did not correctly diagnose his symptoms as those of @entity4			1
" writing for @entity0 earlier this month , @entity94 chief @entity93 said one way for the @entity81 to prevent the disease spreading in the @entity81 is to tackle it at the source , in @entity85			1
" after all is said and done here , that is the only way to truly and completely protect the health security of @entity81 -- and the world , " @entity93 wrote			0
this view was echoed by @entity7 , who added that there were some encouraging signs from two of the countries in the region that have been worst affected			2
" as long as there is a major epidemic in @entity85 , the rest of the world is also at risk			2
that is an additional reason for providing assistance to stop the epidemic			0
and because there will be people who will show up -- be it in @entity122 , in the @entity81 or in @entity123 , " he said			0
watch the full interview on " @entity11 , " this sunday at 10 a.m. and 1 p.m. et on @entity0 " the good news is that both @entity126 and @entity127 have been able to contain a number of important cases , " @entity7 said			1
" in @entity127 , there was never even any secondary case			0
in @entity126 , there were a number of people who were infected and died , but it has not given rise to an outbreak in @entity38 , after all , a city of more than 20 million people			2
" " that shows that if you act decisively and early enough ... it can be controlled			0
" asked by @entity10 what steps he would like to see taken to try to halt the spread of the virus , @entity7 suggested that it is particularly important to focus on protecting health workers			1
" something that we 've learned through @entity149 is how to treat patients , to care for them and isolate them so that they do n't infect others			0
but also to reduce , more or less , mortality , " he said			0
" we need to protect health care workers			0
we 've seen it in the @entity81 we 've seen it in @entity122			0
but above all , in @entity85 , where over 200 nurses and doctors and lab workers have died from @entity4			1
and that can be done by protective care			0
" but he added that the biggest challenge in slowing the spread of @entity4 is changing the kinds of behaviors that allow it to spread			2
" stopping the transmission in the community around funerals -- that is still going on			0
and so we have to change people 's behaviors and beliefs and also what to do with all the patients who are still at home , who can infect people while they 're being transported to hospital units			0
" " so that 's going to be a massive undertaking of behavior change			0
and it will have to come from within , where their beliefs are influenced and where safe behaviors have to be introduced			0
and that can come from traditional chiefs , from the opinion leaders in each community			0
" asked whether he believed the @entity81 was overreacting to the potential spread of @entity4 , @entity7 said he hoped the extensive media coverage of the virus would ensure that people are more aware of how to protect themselves			1
but he said he also believed it was possible to get the current outbreak under control			2
" i 'm not worried about an epidemic in the larger population , " he said			0
" there will be cases			2
i think we should not be naive about that			0
but i think it can be contained			0
