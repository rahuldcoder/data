@entity0 has issued a defiant message to his rivals for the @entity5 presidency and challenged @entity7 governing body @entity6 to put up a candidate of its own in the election later this year			1
@entity0 , who is seeking a fifth term at the helm of world football 's governing body , told @entity1 in an exclusive interview that he still had unfinished business and would not step aside without a fight			1
" i have to say i have not finished my mission because it 's a mission to be in football			2
we have started in 2011 with the reform process			2
the reform process is not over			2
i would like to have these four years to finish it and to show that football is more than a game			1
" but @entity5 has been mired in controversy since its decision to award the 2018 and 2022 @entity30 to @entity31 and @entity32			1
criticism reached a fever pitch when the man hired to investigate the bidding process for those @entity30 , @entity38 lawyer @entity37 , resigned in protest last year , unhappy that the published summary did not accurately reflect his findings			2
@entity0 has faced calls to stand down and although @entity6 is yet to declare its official position , he clearly believes they are campaigning behind the scenes to depose him			1
" they want to get rid of me , " he told @entity1			2
" all this opposition is coming now it 's unfortunate to say it , it 's coming from @entity51 , from @entity6			1
they do n't have the courage to come in			0
" so let me go ( on ) - be respectful ! because in football you learn to win but you also learn to lose			0
so i 'm going now			0
if i win the better , if i lose ok ! " a @entity6 spokesman told @entity1 sunday that they had no immediate comment to make over @entity0 's remarks			1
three candidates have so far stated their intention to challenge @entity0 ; @entity63 @entity62 , @entity64 of @entity65 and former star footballer @entity66			1
all must get the backing of at least five of the 209 member associations of @entity5 by a deadline of january 29th to get on the ballot paper for the election on may 29			1
@entity0 appears unfazed by his likely opponents , with or without another candidate throwing their hat into the ring at this late stage			1
" i have been asked by the national associations to be our candidate again because nobody that is strong was in			1
so i go there , " he said			0
he also appears to be relishing the fight ahead , despite closing on his 79th birthday in march			0
" i 'm now 40 years in @entity5			1
i 've been the president since 1998			2
" you know it is impossible to make everybody happy			0
" if i would have only positive press then it would not be good			0
and i like criticism as long as the criticism is ... i would say fair criticism			0
i like the discussion to go with that			0
but listen i 've been there such a long time now and i just want to finish that , " he added			0
but perhaps at odds with his other comments , @entity0 also called for unity in football , effectively inviting @entity6 to put up or shut up			1
" football is a team sport			0
let 's go together with the team			0
i invite the confederation of @entity6 and especially the leaders of @entity6 that are so bitterly attacking me : join ! join ! football is a unity			1
and we need this unity in this world			0
" and if he can not find the necessary level of support and extend his tenure as the most powerful in world football , @entity0 came up with a surprising choice of new career			1
" the day i 'm going to retire the first thing i 'm going to do is radio			2
i always said i will do radio			2
" because radio is even more popular than television , than all electronics ... i said one day - this was my boy 's wish - to be a radio reporter one day			2
i do n't know but i 'm not so bad			0
" the first indication of whether @entity0 will be seeking out new horizons may well come on february 7th or 8th , the date he revealed to @entity1 when @entity5 will make public the full list of qualified candidates for the election			1
" anyway , i 'm in and i do n't mind			0
it 's not my first battle for the presidency			0
i still have the conviction and i believe in myself and i believe in football , " the @entity137 said .			0
