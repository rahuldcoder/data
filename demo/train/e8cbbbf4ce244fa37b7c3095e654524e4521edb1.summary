@entity4 said he endured hours of questioning over several weeks in sound - proofed rooms by interrogators he could not see			2
" i was heading to the gate , " the @entity13 - @entity12 journalist said			1

i said ' yeah that 's me			0
' he said ' please step to the side ... you 're not going to be flying tonight			0
' " it was an ominous introduction to @entity25 's security apparatus			2
@entity4 spent the next 21 harrowing days in @entity25 prisons , accused of espionage , subjected to interrogations and , on several occasions , beatings			1
the journalist , a freelance writer and gifted photographer who had been on assignment for the @entity35 newspaper at the time of his arrest , spoke to @entity2 by phone from his parents ' home in @entity41 thursday , several days after an extraordinary international lobbying effort helped secure his release			1

the reporter resisted , and began yelling to crowds of nearby passengers that he was a journalist			0
" i got kind of pulled kicking and screaming and getting punched behind an escalator , " @entity4 recounted			2
while being dragged outside to an unmarked car , the journalist said he managed to get the attention of a @entity64 - looking woman waiting in the airport			2
to this day , @entity4 says he does not know the woman 's name			2
but he believes she was instrumental in helping spread the word of his detention			0
" she was the best thing that happened to me that day , " @entity4 said			2
" i just said ' i 'm a @entity13 reporter for the @entity35			1
' and she ran after me with a note pad and pen and asked me to spell my name			0
" international human rights organizations estimate thousands of @entity25 have gone missing , since the @entity25 government launched its crackdown on opposition activists and journalists following the disputed june 12 presidential elections			1

but in @entity4 ' case , the @entity13 @entity89 announced it was working for the journalist 's release just days after his arrest			1
that night , @entity4 says security officers forced him to ride into @entity7 from the airport , with his head buried in his lap. later , when he tried to make a phone call from a police station in @entity7 , @entity4 said security forces tackled him , threw him to the ground , beat him with a club and pepper - sprayed him			1
eventually , they transferred him to @entity7 's notorious @entity105 , where he witnessed new @entity25 prisoners being delivered by the busload to the prison gates			1
that is where the interrogation began			0
dressed in a prison - issue uniform , @entity4 endured hours of questioning over the next several weeks in sound - proofed rooms where he was never allowed to see his interrogator			0
" i just sat in one of these school desk situations , a chair with a desk extension , " he explained			0
" i was told to face the wall ... and they sat behind me and they crooned into my ear			0
" on the second day of his incarceration , a prosecuting judge told @entity4 , a fluent @entity125 speaker , that he was facing charges of espionage			1
since incumbent president @entity130 was declared the winner of the june 12 election , opposition candidates and their supporters have accused the @entity25 government of falsifying election results			1
in response , the @entity25 government has accused @entity64 governments , particularly @entity12 , of organizing large protests in the streets of @entity7 and other cities			1
" the lesson i take from this is that the @entity25 , " @entity4 said , " have decided to start arresting foreigners			1
" last may , an @entity25 - @entity143 freelance journalist named @entity144 , was released after being detained for four months on charges of espionage			1
this week , @entity147 president @entity146 demanded the release of 23 - year old @entity149 , a @entity147 academic reportedly arrested last week on charges of spying			0
meanwhile @entity152 , an @entity25 - @entity153 who freelanced for @entity155 , is another prominent intellectual now sitting in an @entity25 prison			0
according to the @entity158 - based organization committee to protest journalists , @entity25 is now the " world 's top jailer of journalists , " with at least 30 reporters and bloggers in prison			0
unfortunately , few of these prisoners enjoyed the international support that was rallied on behalf of @entity169 , said @entity170 , a @entity13 journalist and vice president of the @entity172 in @entity173			1
after learning of his colleague 's arrest , @entity170 launched a @entity177 page titled " @entity178			0
" meanwhile , the spiritual leader of the @entity180 , the @entity181 of @entity0 , also intervened			0
he sent a high - ranking cleric and a letter to the @entity184 in @entity0 , to plead for @entity4 ' release " on humanitarian grounds , " said father @entity187 , an adviser to the patriarch			0
" @entity25 has separate nodes of power , " @entity170 said			0
" the patriarch 's statement appealed to one node with religious sentiments			0
" @entity4 says the lowest point came 19 days after his arrest , when it appeared he would be released			1
" they took me to the airport , the @entity13 ambassador met me with a ticket			2
we started heading towards the gates , then we suddenly veered off to the escalator , " the 30 - year old journalist said			0
" i promptly got re-arrested and spent this very strange night in a windowless room listening to bags thumping through the chutes and listening to departure announcements ... it was the most scary time			0
" it took another 24 hours of intense diplomacy led by @entity13 ambassador @entity212 before @entity4 finally flew safely out of @entity7			1
throughout his ordeal and the countless accusations of spying , @entity4 said he realized one thing about his captors : they had never bothered to read any of the articles he has published over the years about @entity25			1
" i was shocked that they would arrest someone who had lived in @entity25 and had such a record of trying to introduce @entity25 society to an outside audience			0
