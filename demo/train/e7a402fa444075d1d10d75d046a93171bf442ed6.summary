the rare moments @entity2 can take a break from running his own painting business , he can be found toiling away on his family 's dream house in the suburbs of @entity8			1
" i 'm a working guy			2
i work every day , six days a week , even seven if i have to , " @entity2 says			1
one day this past march , without warning , the government took his house away , even though he and his wife , @entity12 , have never been charged with a crime or accused of any wrongdoing			1
" i was so upset thinking somebody 's going to take my house for nothing			1
that makes me crazy , " @entity2 says , shaking his head			1
the nightmare began when police showed up at the house and arrested their 22 - year - old son , @entity23 , on drug charges -- $ 40 worth of heroin			1
authorities say he was selling drugs out of the home			2
the @entity30 say they had no knowledge of any involvement their son might have had with drugs			1
a month - and - a - half later police came back -- this time to seize their house , forcing the @entity30 and their children out on the street that day			1
authorities came with the electric company in tow to turn off the power and even began locking the doors with screws , the @entity30 say			2
authorities wo n't comment on the exact circumstances because of pending litigation regarding the case			2
police and prosecutors came armed with a lawsuit against the house itself			1
it was being forfeited and transferred to the custody of the @entity8 district attorney			2
authorities said the house was tied to illegal drugs and therefore subject to civil forfeiture			1
in two years , nearly 500 families in @entity8 had their homes or cars taken away by city officials , according to records from @entity66 's attorney general			2
authorities use a civil forfeiture law that allows them to seize people 's property when that property is connected to the sale of illegal drugs			1
@entity74 legal analyst and consumer attorney , @entity75 , says the law is intended to protect the public			0
" it discourages crime and it takes the ill - gotten gains away from the bad people			0
" but not all people who have their property taken away are charged with a crime			0
unlike criminal forfeiture , the civil law allows authorities to seize property without the owner ever being convicted or even charged			1
in @entity91 property can be forfeited only if the property owner is actually convicted of a crime			1
this is not so in other states			0
civil liberties attorneys with the @entity97 , who recently filed a class action lawsuit against @entity8 authorities for abusing the law , say , " civil forfeiture is something that is an assault upon fundamental notions of private property ownership and due process			1
" but @entity75 disagrees , " it 's a good law			0
that does n't mean that it does n't sometimes have issues that need to be corrected			0
the system constantly has to change			0
" in @entity66 , the @entity8 is far and away the most aggressive in the state when it comes to people 's property			0
over a four - year period , @entity117 , the second largest county in @entity66 , filed about 200 petitions for civil forfeiture			1
@entity8 filed nearly 7,000 petitions in one year alone , according to the class action lawsuit , in which the @entity30 are plaintiffs , along with other @entity8 citizens			0
@entity8 officials seized more than 1,000 houses , about 3,300 vehicles and $ 44 million in cash , totaling $ 64 million in civil forfeitures over a 10 - year period , according to the lawsuit			0
the very authorities taking the property appear to be profiting from it , according to @entity66 state records			0
the @entity66 attorney general 's office says about $ 7 million went straight to the salaries for the @entity8 district attorney 's office and the police department in just three years			0
in that same time period , records show the @entity138 's office spent no money on community - based drug and crime - fighting programs , according to the @entity147 's office			1
the @entity8 district attorney 's office told @entity74 it seizes property only as a last resort , and added that it is limited in what it can currently say because of the pending litigation			0
" in most cases the @entity152 does n't pursue forfeiture because the underlying issue with the real estate is resolved when a settlement agreement is reached with the property owner in which he or she agrees to take reasonable efforts to prevent future narcotics dealing from the property			1
" the da 's office also says it works directly with citizens , the police , government agencies , and community groups in an effort to abate or close drug properties			2
civil forfeiture can be used on the federal or state level			2
only eight states -- @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity177 , @entity91 , @entity178 and @entity179 -- require seized funds be placed in a neutral account			0
other states allow law enforcement to directly profit from the civil forfeitures or put proceeds into a special crime fighting fund			0
in some states , like @entity66 , the burden is on the property owner to prove their innocence			0
the @entity30 say they had to go to a courtroom and fight to get their home back where , instead of facing a judge , they faced a prosecutor from the @entity138 's office			0
there was no courtroom or judge , @entity197 says			0
" there 's just one guy telling us to sign these papers			0
" after eight days of sleeping on a family member 's couch , the @entity30 were let back into their house , but only on the guarantee they would ban their son from the house -- a heartbreaking decision , they say			1
( their son pleaded no contest to the drug charges			1
) still fighting the city to resolve their case and stay in their home permanently , @entity217 says : " to me i 'm home , but i feel violated at this point			0
i 'm doing things in my house , but i worry is it always going to be my house ? are they going to take it one day like that ? " the @entity8 district attorney 's office told @entity74 it strictly follows the state law in an effort to crack down on drug abuse			1
" in these efforts we will follow applicable law to protect the rights of those involved -- not only drug dealers and those associated with them -- but the law - abiding citizens who are negatively affected by them			2
" authorities : drug ring targeting top suburban @entity8 schools busted			2

@entity2 family ousted from their house
