@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's decision to expel @entity6 's diplomats from @entity7 ensures that the bloody test of wills in @entity1 will grind on for weeks , if not months to come			1
barely 15 days ago , there was optimism from regime insiders here in @entity0 that a deal was in the works to resolve the five - month conflict			1
perhaps this was because the @entity19 holy month of @entity20 was fast approaching , and with it , an anticipated slow - down in fighting on the front - lines			0
also , the regime was engaged in talks on multiple fronts with its @entity28 , @entity29 , and @entity1 opponents			1
developments over the last two weeks appear to have killed those hopes			0
first , the @entity29 joined the growing list of countries officially declaring the rebel council based in @entity35 the " legitimate governing authority for @entity1			2
" a day after secretary of state @entity37 made the announcement in @entity39 , @entity40 , the message was personally delivered during a round of secret talks in @entity44			0
the @entity29 said they had one message for the @entity1 , " @entity6 must go			1
" at roughly the same time , the @entity35 - based rebels mounted an attack on the eastern front , against the long - contested oil town of @entity50			2
@entity6 's main spokesman accused the @entity53 military alliance of assisting rebels in the assault			1
he also drew a rhetorical line in the sand around @entity50 , declaring dramatically , " we will kill , we will die for oil			0
you come to get our oil , we will destroy you			0
" since then , the rebel advance on @entity50 has slowed , reportedly due to deadly fields of land mines			0
the rebels admit hundreds of their fighters were killed and wounded during a week of fighting around @entity50 , which @entity68 grandiloquently re-branded " @entity1 's @entity69			1
" meanwhile , the @entity0 regime has been staging large rallies in support of its embattled leader			1
enthusiastic , flag - waving crowds thronged the central squares of different regime - controlled towns and cities			2
partisans swore allegiance to @entity6 and defiantly fired volleys of gunfire in the air			2
@entity84 provided blanket coverage of the events , labeling them " million man marches			0
" the size of the rallies has been the subject of heated debate between foreign journalists and government officials			0
but there is no question that @entity0 has been shoring up popular support for the man who has ruled this country for more than 40 years			2
government officials argue that the rallies prove @entity6 is the democratic choice of the @entity1 people , a position that the rebels have fought and bled to refute			1
therein lies the main sticking point			0
the regime insists cease - fire first , then talks , while also adding that @entity6 's position as " @entity109 " is non-negotiable			1
@entity35 and @entity53 say no talks until @entity6 goes			2
in recent days , both the rebels and officials in @entity113 , @entity7 and @entity114 softened their demands			0
they indicated one possible way out of the stalemate could include @entity6 remaining in @entity1 , rather than going into exile			1
but wednesday 's announcement by @entity4 's top diplomat marked yet another escalation against @entity6 and his cohorts			1
@entity123 announced he would hand over @entity0 's embassy -- as well as some of its frozen funds -- to the rebels in @entity35			1
@entity6 has never been this internationally isolated , even in the dark days of the eighties when @entity130 famously labeled him " mad dog of the middle east			2
" @entity40 and even @entity134 , which abstained from the @entity136 resolution authorizing the @entity53 operation in @entity1 , have both pledged to hand over hundreds of millions of dollars worth of regime assets to the rebels			1
even tiny @entity140 , long described as the " gateway to @entity1 , " has all but broken with the @entity0 regime			1
this week , the @entity136 special envoy to @entity1 seemed to kill all hope for peace			0
after yet another round of shuttle diplomacy between the rebels and the regime , @entity146 offered this grim assessment : " both sides remain far apart on reaching agreement on a political solution			0
" a senior @entity19 cleric told @entity2 that in the month to come , loyalist soldiers could break their daily @entity20 to better fight against what the regime calls " the colonialist , crusader aggression			0
" @entity20 begins in just a few days			0
expect @entity1 's holy month to be a bloody one .			0

there was optimism recently from regime insiders in @entity0 that a deal was in the works
@entity4 move seen as escalation against @entity6
@entity1 insists that a cease - fire must come first
rebels and their @entity176 allies say @entity6 must go
