a handshake is just a handshake			0
fifty - year - old geopolitical conflicts do n't turn on a dime			0
@entity6 foreign policy is n't an @entity7 where you get to wipe the board clean in every news cycle			0
between countries , as with people , grudges and hard feelings do n't fade easily			0
these things are true no matter how eager some in the media are to give president @entity19 's sagging job approval rating -- just 41 % in a recent @entity20 -- a boost by likening him to @entity22			1
seriously ? there is far - fetched , and there is farcical			0
comparing @entity19 to @entity22 falls into the latter category			2
and all because of a simple handshake ? @entity19 briefly shook hands with @entity29 president @entity28 at the memorial for the former @entity32 president			1
now everyone in the media wants to know if there is a thaw in @entity38 - @entity29 relations			1
the preferred narrative is that as @entity22 healed the breach between white and black @entity32 , perhaps @entity19 will now heal the relationship between the @entity38 and @entity29			1
a columnist has to know his limitations			0
whenever i write about @entity29 , the first thing i have to overcome is my sense of ambivalence			2
i 'm a @entity48 - @entity6 living in @entity49 , not a @entity29 - @entity6 living in @entity51			1
the only @entity28 brothers i get worked up about -- @entity54 , the mayor , and @entity56 , the congressman -- live in @entity57 , not @entity58			2
not that i do n't understand why my @entity29 - @entity6 friends still hold a grudge and take a hard line against the @entity28 regime , just like their parents and grandparents before them			1
for instance , i was n't at all surprised that @entity67 sen. @entity66 of @entity68 -- whose @entity29 - born father was imprisoned and tortured in the years before @entity70 rose to power and who traveled to @entity32 to pay his respects to @entity22 as a champion of freedom -- walked out during @entity28 's speech			1
nor was i surprised when @entity77 rep. @entity77 , who was born in @entity29 , cross-examined secretary of state @entity78 during a congressional hearing			2
" mr. secretary , sometimes a handshake is just a handshake , but when the leader of the free world shakes the bloody hand of a ruthless dictator like @entity28 , it becomes a propaganda coup for the tyrant , " she said			1
" @entity28 uses that hand to sign the orders to repress and jail democracy advocates			2
" @entity78 insisted that there was no change in @entity38 policy toward @entity29 , and that @entity19 had been clear in his remarks at the memorial that all nations had the duty to uphold " the basic human rights of their people " and that @entity29 is n't doing that			1
@entity29 - @entity38 are right to keep up their efforts to draw the attention of the international community to the atrocious human rights record of the @entity29 government and the systematic abuse that the regime inflicts upon its own people			1
eventually , as i thought more about the handshake felt around the world , i finally put my finger on what was bothering me about the @entity19 - as - @entity117 - in - chief storyline			1
first , are n't liberals and other @entity19 supporters -- the very people who are now advancing the idea that the handshake was an example of " @entity22 - style " reconciliation -- the same folks who have spent the past few weeks focused on the botched rollout of @entity128 complaining that the expectations on @entity19 are too high ? so now what do they do ? they raise expectations even higher			1
next , i 'm not even sure that @entity19 knows how to bring people together			2
in his five years in office , he has mastered the art of division			0
he pits the poor against the rich , the elderly who help run up staggering deficits against the young who will someday have to pay them off			0
finally , i think of one other handshake between @entity19 and a @entity6 leader that led , well , nowhere			1
in april 2009 , just a few months into his presidency , @entity19 shook hands with @entity149 president @entity148 at the @entity150			2
@entity148 clashed often with @entity151 , and so he probably could n't have been happier to be rid of him			0
but , just a little more than two years later , in december 2011 , @entity148 attacked @entity19 as a " clown " and an " embarrassment			0
" he also sent a message to @entity19 , telling him that he should " focus on governing your country , which you 've turned into a disaster " and " leave us in peace ... go after your votes by fulfilling that which you promised your people			0
" what set @entity148 off were comments that @entity19 made during an interview with the @entity170 - based @entity169 newspaper in which he criticized @entity149 ' business and political ties to @entity173 and @entity29 and raised concerns about the @entity149 government , which had , @entity19 said , " restricted the universal rights of the @entity149 people , threatened basic democratic values and failed to contribute to security in the region			1
" @entity19 was in the right			0
everything he said in that interview was true			0
and , unlike handshakes that quickly fade from memory , the truth endures			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			0

@entity188 : make no mistake , a handshake is just a handshake
@entity188 : president @entity19 's handshake with @entity28 is no big deal
he says it does not mean that @entity38 - @entity29 relations will change for the better
@entity188 : let 's keep in mind the atrocious human rights record of @entity29
