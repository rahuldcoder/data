the @entity0 is suspending all fraternities and associated parties until january 9 following a @entity4 magazine article that described a student 's account of being gang raped and her frustration at trying to bring her alleged attackers to accountability			1
" the wrongs described in @entity4 are appalling and have caused all of us to re-examine our responsibility to this community , " school president @entity11 wrote in a statement to the university community			1
" rape is an abhorrent crime that has no place in the world , let alone on the campuses and grounds of our nation 's colleges and universities			0
" student leaders will hold a news conference at 10 a.m. monday on the campus to " give voice to the student perspective , " according to a @entity32 news release			1
participants include the @entity32 president , the leader of the @entity38 and the presidents of one in @entity40 and @entity41 , support groups for victims of campus sexual abuse			0
rape is a longstanding issue on college campuses , but in recent years student activists , survivors and faculty have portrayed sexual violence as a cultural problem on campuses nationwide -- not just a series of isolated incidents			0
in september , president @entity56 launched " it 's on @entity61 , " a campaign aimed at tackling the problem of campus sexual assaults			0
several days ago , @entity11 asked the @entity62 to investigate the alleged rape			0
" there are individuals in our community who know what happened that night , and i am calling on them to come forward to the police to report the facts , " @entity11 wrote			0
" only you can shed light on the truth , and it is your responsibility to do so			0
" in " a rape on campus : a @entity85 and @entity86 at @entity0 , " the student told @entity4 an upperclassman invited her to a party at the the @entity82 house in fall 2012 and seven men raped her over a three - hour period in a bedroom she did n't want to go to law enforcement but told the school 's @entity88 what happened , @entity4 reported			1
she said she became discouraged because she had difficulty obtaining statistics about campus sexual assaults and learned other students said they were raped at fraternities but with little or no discipline handed out , the magazine said			1
the article said , " at @entity0 , rapes are kept quiet , both by students -- who brush off sexual assaults as regrettable but inevitable casualties of their cherished party culture -- and by an administration that critics say is less concerned with protecting students than it is with protecting its own reputation from scandal			1
" @entity4 said the school did n't decide to investigate the fraternity until administrators learned the magazine planned to write an article			1
the journalist who wrote the story , @entity120 , said sunday on @entity121 that the student she interviewed , identified in the article as @entity124 , was still traumatized but that the national response " has been really gratifying for her			2
" after the first story ran , other students contacted @entity4 to say they 'd also been sexually assaulted at the @entity0			1
those responses ran in a story with the headline " rape at @entity0 : readers say @entity124 was n't alone			2
" students will be on their @entity135 and winter holiday break during much of the fraternal organization suspension			2
classes for the spring semester start january 12			0
@entity11 said she was " suspending all fraternal organizations and associated social activities			0
" before the suspension is lifted , the school will assemble students , faculty , alumni and others to talk about " our next steps in preventing sexual assault and sexual violence , " @entity11 said			2
she also said the university 's board of visitors will meet tuesday to discuss the situation			1
university spokesman @entity154 told @entity121 in an email saturday that @entity11 's order affected about 3,500 students in 31 fraternities , 16 sororities , seven multicultural @entity161 fraternities and sororities and eight @entity164 fraternities and sororities			1
the school has 21,238 students total , about 15,000 of them undergraduates , according to the school website			0
the fraternities and sororities are on private property , so the members living in the houses will not have to seek new living arrangements during the suspension , @entity154 said			0
the university is also hiring an attorney to review the school 's policies on handling sexual assault complaints			1
the national office of @entity82 issued a statement decrying all forms of violence but noting that , " to our knowledge there have been no criminal investigations or charges of sexual assault brought against any member of the chapter			0
" it said the @entity0 chapter will respond to authorities			2
