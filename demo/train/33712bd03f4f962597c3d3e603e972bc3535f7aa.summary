a great crack in @entity2 's middle class came to light recently : while our country continues to lead the world as the richest nation , our middle class , once the most affluent in the world , has fallen behind			1
according to an analysis by @entity13 , @entity11 's middle class is now the wealthiest , and working families in many countries have seen their incomes rise much faster than those in the @entity2			1
the hollowing out of @entity2 's middle class has been years in the making , but it was n't inevitable that working families would fall further and further behind			1
instead , it was the direct consequence of deliberate choices @entity24 has made over the past generation to put the rich and powerful first and to leave working people to pick up whatever crumbs were left behind			1
it did n't have to be this way			0
@entity2 knows how to build a middle class that is the envy of the world			1
after the @entity33 , @entity2 made two critical decisions			1
first , it put in place strong rules to level the playing field for families , putting more cops on the beat to monitor financial markets and passing basic safety rules to temper the boom - and - bust financial cycle			0
second , the country made building a future for our children the priority			0
we invested powerfully in our education system , and we made sure that people who worked full time would stay above the poverty line			2
we built infrastructure -- roads and bridges , our power grids -- so that we had the right foundation for businesses to build jobs here at home			0
we also invested in basic medical and scientific research , confident that if we built a great pipeline of ideas , our children would have opportunities their parents could only dream about			0
these steps were aimed at building a strong middle class , and they worked			1
for a half a century , as the country got richer , our middle class got richer			1
@entity2 built a middle class that promised a bright future to each succeeding generation , a middle class that inched its way toward building opportunities , not just for some of our children , but for all our children			1
i lived this firsthand , growing up in a country that invested in its children			0
after my dad had a heart attack , my mom worked a minimum - wage job at @entity88 -- and that was enough to save our house			1
i went to a commuter college that cost $ 50 a semester , and my first husband worked on the moon shot			0
@entity2 was full of promise			2
about 30 years ago , @entity2 began to move in a different direction			2
@entity24 took financial cops off the beat by slashing funding of our regulators , letting big banks load up on risk and target families with dangerous credit cards and mortgages			2
@entity24 also worked feverishly to cut taxes for those at the top , opening huge loopholes for big corporations and billionaires			2
eventually , the loopholes got big enough to drive a truck through			0
according to the nonpartisan group @entity114 , by 2008 - 2012 , while the corporate tax rate on paper remained 35 % , 26 @entity118 companies paid $ 0 in taxes			0
that 's right -- zero			0
and how did @entity24 propose to balance a budget with lower taxes ? stop investing in the future			2
instead of supporting college kids who are trying to get an education , the government now uses them as a source of revenue , making billions of dollars in profits off student loans			0
investments in roads and bridges have nearly ground to a halt			0
and government research -- the great pipeline of ideas that led to the creation of the @entity142 , nanotechnology , gps and a million medical advances -- has had its legs cut out from under it			0
today , the director of the @entity146 says there 's only enough money to fund one out of six @entity146 research proposals , and our investments in scientific research do n't reflect the values of a nation that plans to lead the world in new discoveries			2
the impact of these policies has echoed through the economy			0
big banks , powerful corporations and billionaires -- people who can afford to hire armies of lobbyists and lawyers -- have amassed more and more wealth			2
meanwhile , the foundations of our once strong middle class have begun to crumble , and families have been caught in a terrible squeeze			1
starting in the 1970s , even as workers became more productive , their wages flattened out , while the costs of housing , health care and sending a kid to college , just kept going up and up			0
in 1980 , the minimum wage was at least high enough to keep a working parent with a family of two out of poverty			1
now , the minimum wage is n't even enough to keep a fully employed mother and a baby out of poverty -- and on wednesday , @entity189 @entity188 filibustered a bill to increase the federal minimum wage modestly			1
we know how to strengthen the middle class in this country because we have done it before			1
we need a level playing field to make sure everyone follows the rules -- and that breaking the law has the same kinds of consequences for bank ceos who launder drug money as for kids who get caught with a few ounces of pot. we need to decide that our children -- not our biggest corporations -- are our first priority			0
we can take on the student loan problem that is crushing our kids , and to rebuild our roads and bridges , upgrade our power grids and expand our investments in basic research			0
and we can pay for that by putting an end to the tax loopholes and subsidies that go to powerful corporations and the wealthiest @entity2			1
we can repair the cracks in the middle class			1
we can strengthen our foundations and make sure that all of our children have a fighting chance			0
but it means changing who @entity24 works for -- and does n't .			1

@entity229 : @entity2 middle class , once richest in world , has fallen behind other nations
@entity234 : @entity24 puts rich and powerful first and leaves working people behind
minimum wage is n't enough to keep employed mom and baby out of poverty , she says
@entity234 : we strengthened the middle class before and can do it again by putting people first
