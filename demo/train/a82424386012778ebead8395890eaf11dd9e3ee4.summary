@entity5 , now 9 , had been in the @entity27 ' care since before she was 2 , and was adopted by the family in 2008			1
before the adoption was finalized , her birth father pleaded guilty to transporting firearms -- a felony -- and was sentenced to 15 years in federal prison			1

screaming bloody murder , ' please do n't let them do this , @entity62 , please , @entity61 , do n't let ' em take me , ' " said @entity22			0
" they took her bags , and that 's the last that i 've seen her , " said @entity8			0
a father 's fight @entity5 now lives in @entity71 , @entity72 -- a world away from the 40 - acre farm she called home in @entity1			1
@entity2 went to @entity71 , hoping @entity46 would answer questions about his daughter and his past			0

but his attorney said -- for now -- @entity46 is forbidden by the @entity82 to speak publicly about the case and about his daughter			0
a spokesman for @entity86 released a statement			2
" so many times , foster parents come to love the children who stay in their homes , " @entity88 said			2
" we see that every day in @entity1			2
