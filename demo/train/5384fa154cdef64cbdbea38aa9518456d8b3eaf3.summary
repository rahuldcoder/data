-- a move is afoot to make the oil - rich province of @entity3 a more potent political and economic power in @entity5			1
along with provincial elections in @entity5 , residents in @entity3 may also be voting to become an autonomous region			2
lawmakers have started a drive that would give the @entity12 - dominated province the status of a federal region -- the same legal power as the multi-province autonomous region of @entity17 in northern @entity5			2
the move would usher in self - government and could boost oil income in @entity3 , although the organizers of the drive have indicated they would be more cooperative with the central @entity5 government than @entity17 is on oil matters			1
@entity5 affairs scholar @entity25 suggests the autonomy initiative -- which he notes is the first of its kind outside the @entity31 areas -- " shows that the inhabitants in @entity3 may care more for their local patriotism than for their religious identity as @entity12			2
" " @entity3 holds perhaps 60 percent of @entity5 's oil reserves , whereas most of the other @entity12 areas of @entity5 have only insignificant amounts of oil , " said @entity25 , a research fellow at the @entity36			1
@entity41 -- a @entity3 member of parliament and a former @entity3 provincial governor -- is leading the drive and has hinted that he wants the region to receive its own share of the oil income generated there , @entity25 said			1
the effort is also backed by a powerful local movement called the @entity51			0
@entity5 is a collection of ethnicities and religions , and there has been a tug of war between a central government attempting to tie the country together and various groups pursuing their own interests			0
the @entity17 have had their three - province autonomous region in the north for years , and the central government and the @entity17 have had their disagreements : the @entity17 have used their autonomy to pursue oil contracts that are n't recognized by @entity5 's central government			1
but @entity68 said his @entity3 initiative is not seeking " to interfere with the central government when it comes to the administration of the oil sector and the signing of contracts			1
" " the federalists in @entity3 appear to be more prepared to work with @entity77 than the @entity17 have been so far , " @entity25 said			2
a monthlong petition drive started monday for a @entity3 region referendum -- which would be held if at least 10 percent of the more than 1.4 million registered voters in the province sign up , said the @entity82 , or @entity82 , which is helping @entity5 with its electoral process			1
residents have until january 14 to go to 34 locations in the province to submit their signatures			0
a referendum could be held two to three months after @entity5 election officials certify that the required number of signatures was gathered , a @entity82 source told @entity0			0
the voting age in @entity5 is 18 , but anybody born in 1991 will be allowed to register and submit signatures after january 1			0
under the country 's constitution , any of @entity5 's 18 provinces may form federal regions , either alone or as a group			0
regions have the right to create their own constitutions , have separate executive , legislative , and judicial branches of government , and have security forces under their control			1
" in the case of a contradiction between regional and national legislation in respect to a matter outside the exclusive authorities of the federal government , the regional power shall have the right to amend the application of the national legislation within that region , " the constitution says			0
" what rights the regions will have with regard to the oil sector remains controversial , " said @entity25 , also the editor of @entity122 -- where he posts scholarly papers about @entity5 , including one on monday about the @entity3 region			1
another idea for an autonomous region has emerged from the @entity132 , one of the parties in the ruling @entity135			0
it is looking at a nine - province federal region in the south			0
@entity3 is the only @entity5 province that borders a body of water -- the @entity141 waterway near the @entity142			1
the province also borders @entity144 and @entity145			0
cities in the province include @entity3 city , @entity149 and @entity150 .			2
