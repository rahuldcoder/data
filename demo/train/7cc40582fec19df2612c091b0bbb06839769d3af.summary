-- i do n't care much for @entity3 's politics , but i do like her word " refudiate			1
" as i just typed the word , a squiggly red line appeared under it with a suggestion that i change the word to repudiate			2
well , for the record , i repudiate that suggestion and refudiate it			1
people who do n't like political figures often make fun of their language			1
@entity16 said of a @entity18 speech : " it is rumble and bumble			1
it is flap and doodle			2
it is balder and dash			0
" @entity25 's enemies portrayed him as a hick from the sticks , not just because of his brother @entity28 , but for his @entity30 speech , including his pronunciation of nuclear			1
it does n't seem to matter whether you have a reputation as brainy and articulate			0
@entity38 's @entity37 dialect created a cottage industry of comic impressionists			1
at the other end of the spectrum was @entity43 , whose @entity44 were legion			0
opponents of president @entity46 attack his use of language as elitist , professorial or passionless			0
in other words , @entity3 stands in good company			1
and i stand with her			0
what was her crime ? she made up a new word -- unintentionally perhaps , but it does n't matter			0
i once referred to a highly paid athlete as a godzillionaire			0
i meant to say gazillionaire , but when i caught myself , i realized my " mistake " was better : the athlete 's wealth was ginormous , as big and monstrous as the @entity61 icon @entity60			1
i 'm all for coining neologisms , the technical name for a new word minted into the @entity67 language			1
one type of neologism is called a blend , as when two words are joined to form a third			2
the words web and log gave birth to blog			1
the merger of gigantic and enormous gave us the increasingly popular ginormous , which i thought was a kid 's malapropism until i read it on a billboard			1
there 's a chance that @entity3 , who compared her language creativity to @entity87 's , may in fact be more in tune with mrs. @entity89 , a famous theatrical character who appeared in @entity91 's 1775 play " @entity92			1
" the great lady would lend her name to the confusion of language , as when she meant to say pinnacle but referred to another character as " the very pineapple of politeness			0
" i knew a burned - out teacher who would collect and publish his student 's mistakes , such as a passage in which a young woman was said to " tilt her head with a delicate air of expectoration			2
" @entity110 ! children 's mistakes are often among the most creative			2
my niece @entity113 electrified her family by referring to something as an obstacle illusion			0
this seemed amusing but useless until the recent day when i thought i saw an orange cone blocking my exit from a casino parking garage			0
well guess what ? turned out to be an obstacle illusion			0
@entity123 made great use of blends in poems such as " @entity127 , " in which slimy and lithe collide to form slithy			0
a @entity130 radio word contest invited listeners to coin a word for that straining sound a @entity130 car makes on a frigid morning ? the winner was a blend : cranksinatra			0
the most popular guess is that refudiate was an unintended blend of refute and repudiate			2
i like the fact that the sound " feud " rests in the middle because that seems to define @entity3 's form of maverickism : feudish			1
and let 's not forget the verb refuse , meaning to reject			2
there may even be a historical allusion here ( perhaps an obstacle allusion ) to @entity155 , those disgruntled @entity150 citizens not permitted to emigrate			0
perhaps another influence is radiate			0
maybe if you radiate refusal , perhaps can be said to refudiate			2
i 'm for more fun and more color in political speech , including the occasional swing and miss that turns into a home run			1
the alternative is all script and spin , all euphemism and disclaimer , all flap and doodle , signifying nothing			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity177 .			1

@entity177 : @entity3 's creation of a new work , " refudiate , " was *inspired*
he says blending words has a long history in @entity67
the words " web " and " log " gave birth to " blog , " @entity177 says
@entity177 : " i 'm for more fun and more color in political speech "
