the @entity0 said thursday it had heard enough from @entity1 , the non-profit group at the center of a @entity4 gun printing controversy			1
the department sent a three - page cease and desist letter dated wednesday to @entity8 , the organization 's 25 - year - old founder and self - described anarchist , demanding that the group remove instructions for printing a handgun with a 3 - d printer from its website			1
earlier this week @entity8 posted a video online showing a single shot being fired from " @entity18 , " a plastic handgun that , with the exception of a metal firing pin and a piece of metal included to comply with the @entity24 , was assembled entirely from parts made with a @entity4 printer			1
on the @entity1 website , a one - line banner read , " @entity30 files are being removed from public access at the request of the @entity34 @entity33			2
" the site had been scrubbed of the documents by thursday afternoon			0
@entity8 later tweeted " # @entity30 is going dark at the request of the @entity37 @entity33			0
some shapes are more dangerous than others			0
" at issue was whether @entity8 had violated @entity41 by posting files on his website allowing users to download and print firearms with @entity4 printing technology			1
" @entity1 may have released @entity41 - controlled technical data without the required authorization from the @entity50 , a violation , " the @entity0 's letter to @entity8 said			1
@entity53 printed guns are a boon for criminals regulations that the government alleges @entity8 violated would require approval for the design , development , production , manufacture , assembly , operation , repair , testing , maintenance or modification of firearms including blueprints , drawings and plans , or just about every aspect required to print a gun using a @entity4 printer			1
the letter also said that @entity1 likely did n't get the proper approval to release the technical data it had posted online			2
@entity8 says he founded @entity1 as a non-profit and posted the documents in the public domain			2
" i have never had to consult them , so i had n't , " @entity8 told @entity82 by phone			0
a @entity0 spokesperson who declined to be named confirmed that the department had been in contact with @entity1 but would not comment further on that particular case			1
regulating the export of defense items is a national security issue , the spokesperson said			0
@entity8 , a law student at the @entity92 in @entity93 , has made no secret of his disdain for the @entity34 government in particular and all governments in general			0
( @entity1 makes and sells components with names like " @entity100 " and " the @entity101 , " to tweak politicians who support gun control )			2
@entity8 told @entity82 he had complied with the @entity0 's requests but acknowledges his next step will be to find an attorney who can help him fight for what he believes is a battle about the future of the @entity110 and the future of information control itself			2
" for me , it 's important as a symbolic political statement , " he told @entity82 monday			0
" and that statement is something like , ' no , the future we imagine is one of personalized manufacture and access to objects			0
it does n't matter what the decision is on @entity128 ... in this future , people will be able to make guns for themselves			0
' but for federal authorities trying to put a stop to @entity4 gun files , sharing it might already be too little , too late			1
the files have been posted on international servers outside the reach of the @entity34 government 's authority , and @entity8 notes , " ( the files ) have been downloaded from our website more than 1 million times			1
" since monday , politicians nationwide have moved swiftly to attack @entity146 guns			0
lawmakers in @entity148 , the @entity149 , as well as a handful on @entity151 said they intend to fight block @entity4 gun printing technology .			1

@entity0 demands that group remove @entity4 gun printing instructions from its site
@entity1 may have run afoul of @entity41 , letter says
the group 's founder complies but notes that the plans have more than 1 million downloads
the @entity167 group released a video of a shot fired from a plastic handgun
