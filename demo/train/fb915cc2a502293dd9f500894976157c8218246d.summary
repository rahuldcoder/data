-- in a bid to end rampant poaching , @entity1 is implanting microchips in every rhino nationwide , an extensive process that will include sedating hundreds of animals			1
decimated by illegal killings , the endangered rhino is increasingly under attack by poachers using high - tech , sophisticated technology			1
the microchips will allow wildlife officials to track the animals and trace poached horns			1
" it 's a costly and time - consuming process to get the chips on the rhinos , " said @entity17 , the @entity18 communications director for eastern and southern @entity19			1
" the rhinos have to be tracked , identified , sedated , fitted with two chips each ( on the horn and on the animal ) , revived and finally released			0
" @entity1 has 631 black rhinos and a total population of 1,030 rhinos , he said			2
the animals are part of the big five that draw tourists , a major source of revenue for the east @entity19 nation			2
the other four are the lion , elephant , leopard and buffalo			0
more money , more problems poaching of the rhino horn is a lucrative industry , with much of the loot sold to the affluent in @entity48 , particularly @entity49 and @entity50			1
in those countries , some believe the horns can cure a series of ills , including cancer and hangovers , and can boost virility			0
a kilogram fetches about $ 20,000 , according to a report by @entity61 , a criminology professor at the @entity62			0
a single horn weighs about 10 kilograms ( 22 pounds )			0
in @entity1 , each rhino will get two microchips -- one in the horn and another one in an unidentified part of the animal			1
the microchip is less than 2 inches long and can barely be traced by poachers , @entity17 said			0
the fitting process is expected to take up to four months			0
" with poachers getting more sophisticated in their approach , it is vital that conservation efforts embrace the use of more sophisticated technology to counter the killing of wildlife , " @entity71 said in a statement			2
struggling to keep up organized crime syndicates are using military - grade helicopters , night - vision equipment and guns fitted with silencers , taking rhino poaching to a whole new level and leaving conservationists struggling to keep up			1
@entity89 such as @entity19 and @entity1 have invested in unmanned drones , sniffer dogs and increased security , but have failed to halt the rising tide of rhino slaughter			1
in addition to the microchips , the organization will use forensic dna technology to identify the animals			0
" this will serve to strengthen rhino monitoring , protect the animals on site and also support anti-trafficking mechanisms nationally and regionally , " @entity71 said			0
evidence of poaching once the systems are set up , every rhino nationwide will be traceable , providing investigators with evidence in cases of poaching and making it easier to prosecute suspects			2
