-- new details are emerging about the agent sent by @entity4 counterterrorism agents into @entity5 to track a plot by @entity7 to bomb a @entity9 - bound airliner			1
the agent is of @entity11 origin but holds a @entity13 passport , according to @entity14 , director of security studies at the @entity16			1
@entity14 was briefed on the operation by @entity4 counterterrorism officials			2
the agent , whom another source said had @entity4 roots , lived for a long time in the @entity13 and at some point fell in with jihadist sympathizers , @entity14 told @entity0			1
that made him an attractive target for @entity4 counterterrorism agencies , which recruited him about a year ago , @entity14 said			2
his background gave him the credibility to infiltrate @entity7 , the @entity5 - based branch of the terrorist organization , which is exceptionally careful about whom it accepts and trusts			1
at the same time , his possession of a @entity13 passport enhanced his appeal to the terror group -- because he could travel without a visa to the @entity9			1
according to @entity14 , the agent was sent into @entity5 as a potential suicide bomber after the @entity4 heard from other informants that a new @entity7 plot was in the works			1
the agent enrolled in an arabic language school in @entity5 in the hope of being talent - spotted by the group			2
@entity7 fell for the bait and the mole connected with the group			2
after he joined them he had to handle the tremendous pressure of what discovery by @entity7 would entail , said @entity14			2
two or three months ago , the agent learned that the group was working on a new device to bomb a @entity9 - bound airplane , and he contacted @entity4 counterterrorism officials from @entity5			1
at this point they informed the @entity9 of the potential threat , and that they had a mole inside the group , according to @entity14			2
the agent was later provided training in how to use the explosive device in a training facility in @entity5 , possibly inside a safe house , according to @entity14			2
" he received instruction how to how to avoid detection at the airport , how to behave , " @entity14 told @entity0			0
" apparently he was able to convince @entity7 that he is genuinely ready to carry out the mission			0
" @entity14 said his understanding was that @entity7 intended the would - be suicide bomber to fly through a @entity71 country to connect to a @entity9 bound flight			1
the @entity4 operation culminated with the agent and another @entity4 informant -- likely his handler -- being whisked out of @entity5 , @entity14 said			1
the @entity4 knew they would never be able to use the agent again , and they and smuggled him through a number of @entity80 countries to protect him from @entity7 retaliation , @entity14 told @entity0			1
" my information that he was pulled out after the device was handed to him , and they ordered the green light to carry out the operation			0
i do n't think he was pulled out prematurely , " @entity14 told @entity0			0
" the family is secure , and the man is outside the @entity80 , " @entity14 told @entity0			0
the device that @entity7 bomb - makers had built for the mole was flown from @entity5 to @entity4 by @entity4 counter-terrorism agents and handed over -- around april 20th -- to @entity9 intelligence officials			1
they subsequently took it to the @entity9 for forensic analysis , @entity14 told @entity0			0
he also said the intelligence community remained deeply worried that similar devices might be unaccounted for and that @entity7 may be planning a similar operation			0
the details collected from the device brought out of @entity5 could allow for important counter-measures to thwart @entity7 's next operation			1
the recovered device had two triggering mechanisms -- one involving a chemical reaction and one designed to be set off manually -- to maximize the chances that the device would work , said @entity14			0
it contained 250 - 300 grams of the high explosive @entity112 , a slightly smaller amount than that used in two printer cartridges for an october 2010 plot aimed at blowing up cargo planes en route to the @entity9			0
those devices were intercepted after a tip by @entity4 counterterrorism , and had the potential to bring down a plane , according to @entity13 and @entity9 officials			1
the underwear device used in the attempt to bring down a @entity9 airliner on christmas day 2009 contained about 200 grams of the same explosive			0
@entity4 counter-terrorism officials believe the device was likely constructed by a team working under the supervision of @entity131 , @entity7 's chief bomb - maker			1
when the device used in the @entity137 plot was examined , a set of fingerprints matched those of @entity131 held in a @entity4 database			0
@entity14 said @entity131 was the target of a drone strike last year after @entity5 and @entity4 intelligence developed information about his possible location			1
the @entity5 , he said , subsequently established that another member of the group and not @entity131 was killed in the strike			0
meanwhile , a source working closely with @entity9 intelligence agencies and the military told @entity0 that @entity7 's @entity5 affilliate now has " a whole outfit designated to target the @entity9 homeland			1
" the @entity9 believes @entity7 is working on " several types of bombs " that could get past airport x-ray screening machines			1
counterterrorism officials in the @entity71 and the @entity9 say that @entity7 's expansion in @entity5 over the past two to three years has given it greater breathing room and resources to plot attacks against the @entity9			1
" this is going to give them a major advantage in future operations , " @entity14 told @entity0			0
the group operates out of rudimentary training camps in southern @entity5			0
thought it has not yet succeeded in any bomb plot targeting @entity9 , observers say there are several bombmakers and a group of would - be suicide bombers working inside the group			1
" what i think is concerning to myself and other people is that it seems the talent of the organization is getting better , " said @entity175 , a @entity176 studies scholar at @entity177			0
" that is , they are much more capable of carrying out attacks			0
so when something fails , like the @entity137 plot in 2009 or again , the cartridge plot in 2010 , the organization is able to adapt			0
and the next time they come back , they present a better and more lethal threat			0
i think that 's what has a lot of people in @entity9 and @entity4 intelligence quite concerned			1
" @entity0 has previously reported that @entity131 has been involved in training both bombmakers and suicide bombers			0
the @entity9 - affilliated source said @entity131 is now not making all the components himself , giving the group extra security and the advantage of having multiple manufacturing capabilities if @entity131 were to be killed			2
the source also confirmed that the device the mole turned over had no metallic parts and an advanced detonation system to improve the chances the entire bomb would explode			2
@entity7 bomb designs are aimed at hiding explosives in clothing , camera lenses and animals , according to the source			1
and the fundamental growth in @entity7 's ability to control territory has made them tougher to target since the 2009 incident , @entity175 said			1
" @entity7 at that time was about two to three hundred members , and it controlled no territory in @entity5			2
now , two and a half years later , the terror group has more than tripled in strength to over a thousand members and it controls a great amount of territory in southern @entity5 , " @entity175 said			0
he said the group controls towns , is running its own police department and in some places has established court systems			0
" it 's providing services -- electricity and water -- to some of the citizens , and really it sees itself in parts of southern @entity5 as a government , " he said			2
@entity0 @entity246 correspondent @entity245 contributed to this report .			0

new : the mole studied @entity11 in @entity5 to draw @entity7 's attention , analyst says
new : @entity4 agents smuggled him out of @entity5 and *separately* retrieved the bomb , he says
the man was a @entity13 citizen of @entity4 descent who had fallen in with jihadist sympathizers
@entity263 's @entity5 branch has " a whole outfit " targeting @entity9 , source says
