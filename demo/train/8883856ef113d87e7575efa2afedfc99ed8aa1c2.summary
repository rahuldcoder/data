@entity0 , @entity1 @entity4 chief @entity3 denied knowing that prostitutes were involved in sex parties he joined , as he took the stand tuesday for the first time in his high - profile trial on pimping charges			1
the trial of @entity3 , who saw his stellar career plummet to earth after a separate sex scandal that resulted in his arrest in @entity18 in 2011 , opened in the northern @entity1 city of @entity0 a week ago			1
@entity3 , who 's 65 , is charged with aggravated pimping on the grounds that he organized or encouraged group sex parties in both @entity23 and the @entity24			1
he has denied aiding and supporting the prostitution of seven women			0
asked by the judge tuesday if his position had changed , @entity3 said he knew nothing of the " prostitutional nature " of the parties in which he took part			1
he also faced questions over claims by one of the sex workers that he had brutal sexual relations with her and must have known she was being paid			2
other defendants insist @entity3 was n't told			1
in @entity1 , prostitution is legal , but pimping is not			0
the trial is being closely watched both in his homeland , where @entity3 is commonly known as @entity3 , and around the world			1
there were dramatic scenes as @entity3 's car arrived at court tuesday , when topless protesters with @entity52 slogans painted on their bodies clambered onto his car			1
the activists , from the feminist group @entity56 , were then bundled away by police			0
prosecutors say the operations of the prostitution ring , organized from the @entity61 in @entity0 , stretched all the way to @entity18 and @entity63			0
sex workers involved in the parties said they were like orgies			1
@entity3 , who was married to @entity1 tv journalist @entity67 until their divorce in 2013 , has never denied that he took part in the parties			1
but the crux of his defense is that he did not know prostitutes were involved			0
if the court finds @entity3 guilty of the charges , the former @entity75 director could be sentenced up to 10 years in prison and fined 1.5 million euros ( $ 1.7 million			1
) a former sex worker who 's one of the plaintiffs in the case , named only as @entity83 , described an encounter with @entity3 at the @entity85 in @entity86 when she took the stand tuesday			1
she told the court she had indicated that she did n't like the sexual practices in which they were engaging and that @entity3 registered this			2
he remained smiling when she cried , she said			0
however , she said , she consented to the brutal sexual act because she needed the money			0
the woman also said that her presence at the hotel was " essentially for @entity3 , " adding , " i was told we were there for him			1
" the former sex worker contended that none of the participants in the parties could have been unaware that the women involved were prostitutes			1
questioned by the judge , @entity3 denied having seen @entity83 crying while they were having sex , and he said he would have been petrified if he had noticed			1
he also said he 'd been given no sense of refusal by her			0
referring to other testimonies in the case , he said other women had refused to have sex with him at the parties and that he 'd accepted their decision			2
" when others said no , it was no , " he said			0
asked why fellow defendant @entity118 , a friend and businessman , would not have told him the women were being paid for sex , @entity3 said @entity118 knew he did not like prostitution			1
his friend wanted to please him by telling him the women were just " libertines , " @entity3 said , and did n't realize the risk this represented for him			2
as to @entity83 's claim that he must have been aware she was a sex worker , @entity3 said that she had provided no concrete evidence to demonstrate that he knew			1
another defendant in the case , businessman @entity130 , denied having told @entity83 that she was essentially there for @entity3 , also a friend of his			2
prosecutors say @entity130 and @entity118 picked up the bills for the sex parties for their influential friend			1
another defendant , @entity137 , an occasional sex worker who 's also accused of being a pimp , also testified tuesday			1
@entity118 said she was introduced to @entity3 as a restaurant owner and the prostitute she accompanied to a party as a restaurant employee			2
@entity118 reiterated that the former @entity75 director was not supposed to know the status of the women			0
the judge asked @entity118 and @entity147 , a former senior policeman also accused in the case , if they were expecting professional benefits from their friendship with @entity3 , whom many people once saw as a future president of @entity1			1
they denied that was the case			0
@entity118 and other defendants have previously been adamant that @entity3 was unaware the women were prostitutes and that he never paid them			1
the prosecutor 's office in late 2013 asked for @entity3 's case to be dismissed , citing lack of evidence			2
however , the investigating magistrates did not follow their recommendations			0
altogether , there are 13 defendants in the case besides @entity3 , said @entity168 from @entity169 , one of the plaintiffs in the case			2
a biographer of @entity3 , @entity174 , told @entity2 that he believes the former @entity75 chief 's story in what is known in @entity1 as the " @entity179 affair			1
" " if he knew that the girls were prostitutes , i think he would not have made them come to @entity63 and he would not have had a picture of one of them in his office , " said @entity174			0
in the years since his @entity18 arrest , @entity3 has spent much of his time trying to clear his name			2
he has tried to revive his reputation and start a new career by creating an economic consultancy , taking on both private and governmental clients			0
he needs these clients , according to @entity174 , in order to pay his legal bills			0
@entity174 says he does not believe @entity3 can or will ever be directly involved in politics or policy making again			2
" he is a father , a grandfather , he has suffered a lot , his family has suffered a lot			0
and i do n't think he will have the energy or the will to come back in politics , you know , " the biographer said			0
@entity3 said almost as much himself in an interview with @entity2 's @entity206 , long before the trial opened in @entity0			2
" so i made this mistake to believe that you could have a public life doing what you had to do in the public life			0
... and that you can have a private life , " he said			0
" and my mistake was certainly to believe that you can have these two things together without any connection between			0
it was wrong in the way you say because people are not expecting this kind of heterodox behavior from somebody having public responsibility			0
" the may 2011 sex scandal not only ended @entity3 's tenure as @entity75 director -- a role that gave him huge influence on the economies of countries around the world -- but dashed his presidential hopes			1
he was the leading prospective @entity239 candidate in the @entity1 presidential elections of 2012 , an election his party won			0
@entity3 could well have taken the presidency , which instead was claimed by @entity242			2
the scandal erupted when @entity3 was arrested at @entity18 's @entity244 on charges he had sexually assaulted a maid , @entity246 , at a hotel where he had stayed			1
he resigned in disgrace from the @entity75 , and months of legal battles followed			0
in the end , he was cleared of the charge and allowed to return to @entity1 , only to find that his name had come up in connection with the alleged @entity0 prostitution ring			0
' i do n't think i have any kind of problem with women , ' @entity3 says @entity2 's @entity259 reported from @entity86 and @entity260 from @entity0 , while @entity261 wrote from @entity262 .			1
