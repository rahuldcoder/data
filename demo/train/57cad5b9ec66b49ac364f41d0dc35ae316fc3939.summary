-- move over @entity1 , your crown as queen of reality tv has been stolen by rednecks			1
and not just one redneck , but many of them			2
@entity10 ca n't get enough redneck culture			1
why ? because shows about rednecks are making @entity10 a lot of money			1
the most popular reality shows on cable no longer star " beautiful people " like the @entity19 or " @entity20			2
now that title is held by the likes of the men from @entity25 's " @entity24 , " who make duck calls for hunters and look like a @entity30 cover band			1
also sharing that crown is 7 - year - old @entity32 , better known as " @entity33			0
" she has coined expressions like , " you 'd better @entity36			0
" her show even featured a visit to the " @entity39 , " which her mother described as , " a lot like the @entity42 but with a lot of missing teeth and butt cracks showing			2
" then there 's @entity48 's smash hit , " @entity52 , " which features alligator hunters in the @entity51 bayou			0
also , do n't forget @entity54 's " @entity53 " and @entity56 's new show , " @entity57 , " which stars @entity59 teens and has been dubbed the " @entity60 of @entity61			0
" a quick look at the ratings for these programs makes it clear why the networks are red hot for rednecks			1
the third season of " @entity24 " premiered on february 27 and the episode set the record for the highest rated show in the history of @entity25			1
amazingly , the premiere actually beat " @entity75 " and " @entity76 " that night in the coveted 18 - to 49 - year - old demographic			0
add to that , just last week , " @entity24 " held four of the top 20 spots on all of cable , while " @entity52 " came in as the 14th highest rated cable show			1
comedian @entity81 once joked : " you may be a redneck if your lifetime goal is to own a fireworks stand			2
" but now that line might more accurately be revised to , " you may be a redneck if your goal is to have a hit reality tv show			1
" what makes @entity10 's current love affair with redneck culture so intriguing is that it has demonized these folks for years			1
@entity10 has portrayed rednecks almost exclusively via a parade of inbreeds , morons and bigots			1
the film " deliverance " is the most famous over-the - top example of this trend			0
there are also lighter redneck caricatures such as those in " @entity105 " and " @entity106			2
" the list goes on			0
when @entity10 has n't been demonizing rednecks , it has simply been dismissing them as being part of the " flyover " people who live between @entity112 and @entity113			1
some people in the @entity116 are understandably not happy with these new reality shows because they may be propagating negative stereotypes			2
in december , @entity120 sen. @entity119 of @entity59 called on @entity56 to cancel " @entity57 " for fear it would present " shameful behavior " and advance negative stereotypes about people from his state			0
object all you want , but the tv executives truly do n't care			2
how can i say this ? i 'm from @entity130 , where we were subjected to an onslaught of similar reality shows			0
" @entity60 , " " @entity137 " and " @entity138 " are our equivalent of the horsemen of the apocalypse			0
" @entity60 " did n't end because @entity130 residents complained about the negative depiction , especially of @entity141			0
( i 'm half @entity142 so i was keenly aware of this issue			0
) no , the shows ended when @entity145 got bored with seeing people covered in self - tanner get drunk and hook up in a hot tub or punch each other in a @entity150 bar			0
with the redneck shows , there is a silver lining that was absent with " @entity60			1
" most of us have never seen rednecks be themselves			0
we have only seen @entity10 's interpretation			1
so while i 'm sure there are things that " @entity33 " says or does that make some cringe , there are also real moments with her and her family that are endearing			0
in the " @entity52 " episodes i 've watched , the hunters are portrayed as resourceful people trying to outwit their hunting opponents			0
with " @entity24 , " i 'll be honest , i truly have no idea what the fascination is , but i 'm sure many from other parts of the country asked the same thing about " @entity60			1
" in time , redneck reality shows will pass			1
a new group of @entity145 will become the focus of @entity10 's reality show factory			1
i 'm not sure who that will be but i 'm confident that before the reality show craze ends , every profession , race and culture in the @entity145 will get their 15 minutes of fame			0
but as long as redneck shows get ratings , @entity10 will keep pumping them out			1
to them , it 's not about the " red " of the people 's neck , it 's only about the green			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity195 .			2

@entity195 : shows about rednecks are making @entity10 a lot of money
@entity195 : for years , @entity10 has demonized rednecks in movies , tv shows
he says now the networks like shows such as " @entity24 , " which gets high ratings
@entity195 : in time , redneck shows will pass and @entity10 will focus on other groups
