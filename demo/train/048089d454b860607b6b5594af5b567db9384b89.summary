-- @entity1 is not afraid of reinvention			1
while other boy - band heartthrobs were still recycling the same hooks , the multitalented 30 - year - old had moved on to a solo @entity7 career , fighting his own label to do non-bubblegum songs like " @entity10			0
" now , @entity1 has decided to let his grammys collect dust while he makes yet another leap : pop star to movie star			1
" @entity20 , " opening today , marks the first time @entity1 's name has seen the top of a cast list			1
and it wo n't be the last			0
what 's the secret to @entity1 's crossover success ? no doubt he 's talented , hard - working and easy on the eyes			1
but there 's something else at play here , something rarely acknowledged in articles about @entity1 's stylish clothes and beautiful girlfriends : @entity1 is a nerd			1
that 's not to say he is n't cool			2
he 's the cool nerd , the guy who makes cool seem attainable			1
remember that popular guy in high school who was n't a quarterback or homecoming king , whose sheer likability gave him a spot at the cool kids ' table ? @entity1 is n't so far removed from that kid			1
take a look at " @entity48 , " the facebook - origin movie that put @entity1 , @entity50 , on the map			1
@entity1 plays @entity53 founder @entity52 , the closest thing the film has to a rock star			2
when he saunters into a @entity59 restaurant , heads swivel			0
as @entity52 , @entity1 is charismatic and convincing , but what makes his performance great is a deep , intense vulnerability			1
@entity52 , we realize , is only a celebrity in the insular tech world ; in the real world , he 's just an asthmatic college dropout			0
he 's a person who has carefully crafted his own hyper - cool image , an impersonation of what he thinks a tech - world celebrity ( had there ever been such a thing before ? ) should be			2
at the end of the film , the cracks start to show , and our hearts break a little			0
perhaps @entity1 played @entity52 so well because he , too , is a guy who has carefully curated his own image			2
try to isolate him for a moment from his hit songs , his " snl " skits , his movie trailers			0
would you cast a guy like @entity1 -- the puppy - dog screen presence , the high breathy voice , the @entity88 pad of hair -- as a leading man ? @entity1 knows he 's an unlikely candidate to fill @entity92 's shoes , which is why he 's played his acting career like a chess game : making under - the - radar indie films and popping up casually on " @entity97 " until he was suddenly on every movie screen			1
these days , @entity1 is frequently compared to @entity99 , another @entity100 teen idol who gave it up for a film career			1
but beyond the obvious , it 's not a good analogy			0
@entity99 was born a leading man , buff and intimidating with a sly smile and a natural swagger			2
when he became a movie star , he cut himself off completely from his now - embarrassing foray into rap			0
it 's now amusing to think of @entity99 and @entity99 as the same person , because the differences are so striking			2
@entity1 has a leading - man swagger , too -- but his seems carefully practiced , the way @entity116 would rehearse behind closed doors for hours to make his dancing seem effortless			2
his gestures , his jokes , appear as carefully chosen as his impeccable wardrobe			0
remember , this is the guy who became a decent facsimile of a young @entity126 through sheer hard work and force of will			0
unlike @entity99 , @entity1 has never tried to distance himself from his teenybopper days			1
he knows we 've all seen him as a 14 - year - old in blond dreadlocks and head - to - toe denim			0
and that , too , is part of his charm			0
he makes cool seem attainable for the rest of us geeks			1
when his @entity141 awkwardness shows through his @entity143 persona , he 's the first person to laugh it off			0
he 's not the guy you 'd expect to " have you naked by the end of this song , " as he sings in " @entity149 " -- and that 's why he pulls it off so well			0
all of this makes @entity1 the perfect star for a time when the line between geeky and cool has become more of a zigzag			1
like those @entity159 glasses he wears in interviews , @entity1 has found a way to be the best of both cultures			0
and two weeks ago , the teen - star - turned - pop - star - turned - film - star announced that he would be reinventing the social networking site @entity166			0
it 's life imitating art -- and of all people , @entity1 knows a little something about doing a great imitation .			1

what makes his " @entity48 " performance great is a deep , intense vulnerability
unlike @entity99 , @entity1 has never tried to distance himself from his teenybopper days
he 's the cool nerd , the guy who makes cool seem attainable
