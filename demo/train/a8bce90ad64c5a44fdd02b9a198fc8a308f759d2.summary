-- the immediate destruction from the typhoon are visible and palpable			2
but after the body bags are removed , the deceased mourned and debris cleaned , what happens next ? the toll from typhoons can linger long after and is linked to disproportionate deaths of @entity11 baby girls two years after a storm , according to a recent report			1
in comparison , male infants were not affected to the same extent			2
the authors posit that female infants in the @entity11 suffer " economic deaths , " resulting from economic hardships to households and impacts on how families allocate resources			1
these female infant deaths is 15 times greater than typhoon exposure deaths			1
" a lot of times when you think about climate change or disasters , we focus on obvious immediate damage , " said @entity27 , assistant professor at @entity28			0
" when you look at the enduring legacy of the events , the lag damage is diffused , long - lasting , but serious -- it takes a long time to show up			0
" long before @entity40 , the authors , @entity27 and @entity42 , conducted research on the cost of climate change			1
they chose the @entity11 because of the frequency of typhoons			1
the working paper was completed earlier this year , and is now in peer review for an economic journal			2
it does not examine @entity40 , which hit the @entity11 on november 8 and killed more than 4,000 people			1
the authors had collected economic and health data from the @entity11 government spanning from 1979 to 2008 on how households were affected by typhoons			1
the annual average typhoon exposure deaths was 740 and their analysis found about 11,261 " economic deaths " of female infants in the year after the storms			1
" we saw the big spike in mortality in female infants , " said @entity64 , assistant professor of public policy at @entity66			1
" what was confusing was the mortality emerged a long time after the storm			0
" roughly half of the dying female infants were n't even conceived before the typhoon , so they were not even exposed in the womb			1
the authors found that families reduced health - related expenditures such as nutritious foods and medical visits after a typhoon			2
being struck by a colossal storm can upend a household 's finances			0
for example , a family could lose its roof , toilet and walls , the authors said			0
and the local economy may be devastated as it 's hard for adults to recoup jobs , find income and rebuild homes			0
" the storm is having an impact in the first year of life , " @entity64 said			0
" it 's the fact the storm destroyed the family livelihood , they have to rebuild and get their economic foothold back			0
in that process , they have to cut back in what they spent			0
" @entity11 households reduced spending by 7.1 % , and the average income per household dropped by 6.6 % a year after a typhoon			1
" we see every sector deteriorate after the storm , " @entity64 said			0
" people working in agriculture and services , people working in construction suffer income loss			0
it 's hard for families to get back on their feet after they 've lost their ability to make more money to rebuild their lives			0
" their research suggested that baby girls may inadvertently be bearing the brunt of the economic devastation as families cut back			2
" we think what happens is they cut corners , try to use money to rebuild , but that 's cutting back and damaging people 's health particularly the most vulnerable -- most likely the infant , " @entity64 said			2
but boys were not affected like girls			0
" the big thing is we do n't think it 's active , malicious poor treatment of the girls , " said @entity27			0
" we suspect it 's something more diffuse , something subtle about family 's resources in sons versus daughters			0
" worse health outcomes for female children in times of economic hardships are common patterns , generally thought to occur as parents allocate less resources to girls in their household in countries like @entity163 , @entity164 and @entity165			1
but what perplexed the authors is that the @entity11 is considered an egalitarian society in terms of gender			2
it ranked as the top performer in @entity173 in terms of gender equality , coming in as fifth overall in this year 's @entity178 's report			0
the authors found that mortality among first - born females were moderate , but their risks doubled when the girls had older sisters , and doubled again if they had older brothers			2
" we interpret these findings as strong evidence that female infant mortality is driven by resource scarcity within households and not by physical exposure to typhoons themselves , " the authors wrote			1
with @entity40 , it 's difficult to determine whether the female infant mortality could be much worse the storm exposure deaths , as researchers found in previous years			1
" it 's almost certainly the case there 's a risk of high death toll of female infants in the @entity11 that 's easy to miss if you 're not looking for it , " @entity27 said			1
the authors say relief workers and government officials should pay attention to the impact on infant mortality especially in the next few years in the typhoon - devastated areas .			1

economic research : researchers find spike in mortality in @entity11 female infants after typhoons
research looked at typhoons in @entity11 and impact on household economics and health
report does not *include* @entity40 , but authors say attention needed in infant mortality years after typhoon
