editor 's note : bishop @entity2 is founder and senior pastor of @entity4 of @entity5 , @entity6 , a multiracial , nondenominational church with more than 50 outreach ministries			1
bishop @entity2 says the church must sound the alarm to wake @entity11 from its slumber			1
( @entity13 ) -- the blood - washed church for which @entity15 died is not relegated to one group or another , nor is it held hostage by politics or ethnicity			1
it is a breathing , living testament to @entity24 's love and grace			1
it serves its community where it is located and is aware of the needs and nuances of that community			0
however , its relevance and vision must go beyond its community and reach the world for which @entity15 died			0
today as the church moves from its introspective posture to a broader role in politics , business , media and impacting societal ills , it has the dubious and daunting task of doing so without losing its core function			1
like all such organizations that cease to be intrinsically focused , it runs the risk of being totally misunderstood and misaligned			0
i have listened and watched the events of the last few days with great disappointment as the church and the so - called @entity54 church , in particular , has been painted rather negatively with a broad , wide - ranging brush			1
i personally wish the distinctions of the church by ethnicity would one day become an antiquated idea			2
but this will require more people moving from a segregated worship experience			0
until then , the church is becoming increasingly bruised by those who seek to move it from its core principles and make it an instrument of division rather than a catalyst for unity ! to say the current picture in the media of the institution that i have loved all of my life is less than flattering would be an understatement			1
and because i know that many @entity11 unfortunately do not venture outside of the comfort of their own groups for worship , the only understanding some will have of who we are is based largely on sound bites and media portrayals			0
i want to set the record straight ! i am afraid that once again our churches will be victimized by stereotypical ideas and opinions that are based in whole or in part by the extreme and not the norm			2
the church i have read about in the media -- a church filled with divisiveness , a lack of tolerance for other ethnic groups , a church not focused on helping the downtrodden and less fortunate , a church filled with hostility -- does not remotely resemble the churches that i grew up around and have loved for more than 50 years			1
most , if not all , predominantly @entity54 church doors are open to all , not just to blacks , but to anyone who is seeking a spiritual home , guidance , support , direction , faith and a feeding of the soul in the purest sense			1
many of us have worked with other organizations , different cultures and denominations believing that there is more to unite us than there is to divide us			0
the @entity54 church i know is filled with programs designed to address the many ills that inflict our society : @entity135 / @entity134 , homelessness , reducing the rate of recidivism , assisting with employment and job training , economic development and financial management classes , home buying seminars , food banks to feed the hungry , schools to educate and an active plan to guide our youth			1
those outreaches have been colorblind , passionate depictions of @entity15 's love for all humanity ! the predominantly @entity54 church may be founded by an @entity54 , it may be led on sunday by an @entity54 , but as you look through the crowd of these beacons of hope and faith , you will see an increasing audience that is much more reflective of our world than many would have you to believe			1
@entity159 , black , @entity161 , @entity162 -- nationalities from all across the world come together -- some to visit our churches , to enjoy our music and ministers and still others are gradually starting to join our churches			2
gradually race fades into the fabric of faith and becomes less central to the overarching core of human needs in general			2
is it a perfect union ? of course not			0
is there work to do ? absolutely ! but the core message is not one that enrages , but one that encourages people to change and grow , and any other depiction is distorted and inaccurate			0
the @entity4 , though largely @entity54 , is composed of 20 different nationalities and growing in diversity			1
it is designed much the same way sen. @entity187 has built his campaign : on a strong commitment to reconciliation , the admonition for unity and strong desire for the continuation of diversity instead of exclusion			1
while i have not endorsed any candidate , who can ignore the hunger of @entity11 for change ? no matter who your political choice may be , it is hard to remain ambivalent to the tone that @entity187 sounded , igniting a national response from people of all walks of life , crowding into stadiums openly weeping -- like they were in church -- at the very idea of a nation that reflects the best of our ideals ; not the divisive ranting and bickering that may drive up ratings but threaten the cannibalization of our dreams and the demolition of our hopes			1
as a child , i grew up in a neighborhood back in @entity227 where blacks and whites helped each other in times of need and despair			0
now that i am in @entity5 , @entity6 , i have seen our city struggle to its feet in times of dire desperation			0
i was there when the buses came in to the @entity240 in @entity5 loaded with mostly people of color who were hungry , weak and tired , and needing human dignity			0
they were unloaded -- covered with the stench of the atrocities of the superdome in @entity249			0
i saw blacks , whites and hispanics driving up with bags of clothes and food and crying together , trying to accommodate whomever they could , wherever they could			0
this is the @entity11 i want my grandson to grow up in			0
i am wondering who will get the message that our nation 's citizens are by and large looking for a voice that will unite us , clothe our naked , feed the poor and help our diminishing middle class before we self - destruct like many great empires of the past			1
who cares what color they are , what banner they fly , what gender they are , or how they pronounce their names ? this is a defining moment in our history , and we are about to destroy greatness with petty self - aggrandizing egotism ! i implore you to not take the words of a few and depict the thoughts , hearts and motives of many			2
at the end of the day , dr. @entity288 proved with his nonviolent approach that hate - filled words will not liberate anyone			1
to be sure , there is still work to do to defeat racism and to attain justice in our country for all			0
we continue to need someone who will hold us accountable to our best practices and not our worst			0
but there is no liberation without love , no prosperity without philanthropy and no hope if the church becomes immersed in the quagmire of pettiness			2
as an @entity54 i plead with you that we are running out of time			1
it is critical that we dislodge ourselves from political distractions			0
we must return to the task of looking for the right man or woman who can answer the bloodcurdling cry of a nation that is in search of a leader with a courageous effective plan for the war in @entity323 , and the medical , moral , economic and security issues that are being ignored by these distractions			2
if we do not , we will have done a terrible disservice to our coming generations			0
the @entity328 said that while good men slept , evil ones came and planted tare , a noxious weed , among the wheat ! the tare of a hate - filled church image is a tactical distraction planted to divert our attention from choosing our next president			1
let 's get back to listening for leadership strategies from our best and brightest before there is no country left to lead			2
my hope is that the church remains a vibrant part of our process , sounding the alarm that warns : @entity11 , please wake up out of our sleep ! e-mail to a friend			2
