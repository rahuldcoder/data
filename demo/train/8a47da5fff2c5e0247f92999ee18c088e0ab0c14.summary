@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity1 @entity3 claimed responsibility friday for suicide attacks on a military training facility in the nation 's northwest , saying they were carried out in retaliation for the killing of terrorist leader @entity11			1
the twin suicide bombings killed at least 80 people , nearly all of them military recruits who had just completed their training , said @entity15 , a senior provincial minister			1
about 140 others were wounded			0
" @entity1 and the @entity19 forces should be ready for more attacks , " said @entity17 , a spokesman for the @entity1 @entity3 , who accused the @entity1 military of having alerted the @entity19 to @entity11 's location			1
" @entity11 was our great leader and the killers of @entity11 will have to pay its price , " he said			2
the back - to - back explosions took place shortly after scores of recruits had left the @entity31 , a training facility in the district of @entity34 , said @entity35 , a senior police officer			1
afterward , video of the blood - soaked ground outside the training facility showed it littered with burned vehicles and broken glass			2
the recruits had just completed a nine - month training program when the attackers struck			1
the district of @entity34 borders @entity43 , one of seven districts in @entity1 's tribal region along the @entity48 border			2
@entity49 is believed to be a hideout for @entity3 fighters and @entity53 - linked militants fleeing last year 's military operation in the district of @entity56 and ongoing @entity19 drone strikes in @entity58			1
the @entity1 army has carried out numerous ground and air operations in @entity49 but it has not been able to stamp out the militants			2
the @entity1 @entity3 represent a confederation of @entity3 groups in northwestern @entity1 , where they are based , said @entity65 , military - affairs analyst who is managing editor of @entity67			1
those fighters attack targets in @entity1 and across the border in @entity48			2
the group , which is headquartered in @entity72 , is different from the @entity48 @entity3 , which has been focused on re-establishing the @entity73 in @entity48			2
both groups swear allegiance to @entity3 leader @entity77 and have close ties to @entity53 , he said			2
last december , some 150 militants ambushed six security checkpoints in @entity49 , killing 11 @entity1 soldiers , officials told @entity2			0
earlier in december , a twin suicide attack targeting a government building in @entity49 killed at least 40 people			0
" they 're clearly trying to disrupt our bilateral relationship through this attack , " @entity87 spokesman @entity86 told reporters			0
" but it 's also clear that they are going to carry out these kinds of attacks no matter what			0
" but @entity98 , a @entity1 opposition party leader , said the attacks show that the @entity1 government is doing a poor job managing the crisis			1
" unfortunately , we do not have a trustworthy , credible government , " the chairman of @entity1 's @entity104 ( @entity105 told @entity2			1
" that 's why i 'm calling for the resignation of our own government , free and fair elections and a new , credible government , " he said			0
he cited government figures that cite 34,000 deaths and a $ 68 billion loss to the nation 's economy as a result of terrorism			0
" the people of @entity1 are dying under this war on terror , " he said			0
@entity35 said @entity1 would be in a better position if it would simply decline @entity19 aid			1
" unfortunately , if @entity1 is considered a hired gun of the @entity19 , it reduces its capability to win this war on terror , " he said			1
" if this becomes @entity1 's war , i think @entity1 will win the war			0
but if it 's perceived that the @entity1 army is a mercenary army of the @entity19 , we have no chance of winning			1
" he added , " they target @entity1 because @entity1 is perceived as @entity19 's agents			1
that 's why you see the sort of carnage that 's taking place today			0
" prior to 2004 , there were no suicide attacks and no militant @entity3 in @entity1 , he said			1
" here 's a country that had 500 bomb blasts last year			0
" the vast majority of the fighters are tribal people who are neither terrorists nor religious fundamentalists , he said			0
" they are fighting as a result of @entity1 military operations in the tribal area			0
so a credible government should have peace talks with them and then isolate the @entity53 , which has worried the @entity161			0
" @entity2 's @entity162 and journalist @entity163 contributed to this report .			0
