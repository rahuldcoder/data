editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8 is @entity5 's broadband television network			2
the reports , which are produced solely by @entity5 , reflect a very transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity19 ( @entity20 ) -- @entity22 's photography captures a longing for the space age that lives somewhere between the recently made - possible and the science fiction of the ' 70s and ' 80s			1
inspired by trips to the @entity29 museum of science , @entity22 has been fascinated by the machine world since his youth and incorporates it into most of his work			1
his first project , " @entity36 , " presented a global vision of domesticated landscapes where humans appear slightly out of step with the environment they created			2
in " @entity43 , " he gained access to robotics laboratories and staged a series candid portraits featuring the latest in artificial intelligence going about " their daily lives , " such as responding to e-mails or taking a trip to the water cooler			2
in his " @entity54 , " @entity22 pays homage to the world 's great centers of space exploration and study : @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity62 in @entity63 , various observatories and antenna arrays , and , most recently , the @entity66 in @entity67			1
just this past month , @entity22 finally got permission to shoot in @entity70 's @entity69 in @entity71 , home of the soon - to - be - closed space shuttle program , and @entity22 's holy grail			1
@entity22 ( with us tailing him ) was graciously afforded an almost all - access behind the scenes tour of @entity69 -- mission control was a no - go , unsurprisingly -- which included a pilgrimage to launchpad @entity79 , site of the impending @entity82 mission , @entity70 's last in the @entity84 ( @entity82 , or @entity85 ) era			1
he also got a peek at the @entity70 engine shop , shuttle landing facility and control tower , vehicle assembly building , and mobile launch platforms , as well as several other difficult - to - remember locales			0
see the rest of @entity94 : @entity22 at @entity20 throughout our visit , @entity22 kept asking the kind @entity70 public affairs officers if there were " clean rooms " or " white rooms " he could photograph in , and they were generous enough to let him navigate his way through a handful			1
at one point , we entered an enormous three - chambered room full of men and women working on towering rocket engines			0
it was akin to stumbling on to the set of @entity111 : the movie but with the people in miniature			0
@entity22 snapped a few photos but pressed forward quickly , as he was more interested in the adjacent airlock room with its almost fully white aesthetic			1
here he had a little more more freedom to let his cinematic imagination take hold , as well as the option of positioning a worker in a clean room suit ( aka " bunny suit " )			0
the images are reminiscent of some he took at @entity126 in @entity67 , with their stark empty spaces broken up by vivid lines and colors			0
while the trip represented a longtime goal for @entity22 , there was an overwhelming sense of nostalgia to almost everything we saw			2
it was bittersweet to visit @entity70 while workers were getting their layoff notices and the shuttle program , with all its attendant promise and tragedy , was in its final days			0
viewing the @entity147 orbiter perched on the launch pad and protected by the service structure made it seem very fragile , even though it was made to travel over 100 times the speed of sound			0
to see more photos from @entity22 's shoot at @entity69 , visit @entity155			1

photographer @entity22 *granted* access to shoot at @entity69
stop was part of @entity22 's project paying homage to the world 's centers of space study
@entity22 's fascination with machines is *evident* in most of his work
