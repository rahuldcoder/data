that nine states and the @entity1 have legalized same - sex marriage is encouraging progress for those of us who believe that everyone deserves to have basic civil rights			1
but , even if every state in the country could pass a similar legislation , it would not be enough			0
what we need is for our federal government to step up and make this basic right a law of the land			1
beyond the social discrimination , the refusal of our federal government to legally recognize same - sex marriages imposes steep financial penalties on same - sex couples			1
that two of the most costly penalties are triggered upon the death of one partner just adds to the ache of the senseless discrimination			0
i have been with my partner , @entity28 , for 12 years			0
if i am lucky i will spend the rest of my life living and sharing my joys and happiness with her			0
we have worked very hard as a team to save for our future together and consider everything we have as equally owned by the other			0
if the federal government recognized same - sex marriage , then when one of us dies our assets would seamlessly transfer free of tax to the survivor			1
that 's a basic right that every heterosexual married couple has			0
but because there is no federal recognition of same - sex marriage , if i die first , or vice versa , before either of us can inherit what is now jointly our assets , there would be a federal estate tax bill that one of us would currently have to pay			1
again , to be clear : if we were a heterosexual married couple , there would be no estate tax regardless of the size of the estate or who died first			0
this spring , the @entity64 will weigh in on the constitutionality of the federal @entity66			0
the @entity64 needs to do the right thing and end discrimination against gay couples			1
we all have 83 - year - old @entity70 to thank for in pushing the issue of same - sex marriage equality on to the national front			1
@entity74 and her partner @entity75 were together for 40 years			0
how many marriages do you know that have lasted that long ? but when @entity75 died in 2009 , @entity74 was hit with a $ 363,000 federal estate tax bill because as a same - sex couple they were not eligible for the unlimited marital deduction			2
are we really a nation that says it is fair and just to demand @entity74 pay a $ 363,000 penalty because she is gay ? there 's another penalty that 's even worse			0
regardless of the size of their estates , every gay couple is discriminated against when it comes to @entity94 benefits			1
married heterosexual couples can maximize their @entity94 retirement benefits by taking advantage of the highest - earner 's benefit			2
when both spouses are alive , the lower earner can opt to collect a monthly benefit check that is equal to 50 % of his or her spouse 's benefit			0
for many married couples , that 50 % spousal benefit is often much higher than what the lower - wage - earning spouse could collect based on his or her own earnings record			2
most important , when the high earner dies , the surviving spouse is allowed to collect 100 % of the deceased 's higher benefit			0
because same - sex marriages are n't recognized on the federal level , gay and lesbian couples are not eligible for @entity94 spousal benefits			1
the lower earner can not claim any benefits based on the higher earner 's benefit			0
a heterosexual couple married for just a few months is able to collect a federal benefit that same - sex couples who have been together for decades ca n't			1
are we really a nation that says that is fair ? beyond those two glaring death penalties , health insurance is another area of severe federal financial discrimination against gay couples			1
i am so glad to see more employers extending health insurance benefits to same - sex partners			2
but because same - sex couples are not considered legally married under the eyes of the federal government , the dollar value of the health coverage is considered taxable income			1
a 2007 study estimated that this gay health insurance penalty costs same - sex couples an aggregate $ 178 million ( $ 1,069 per household ) , while employers paid an additional $ 57 million in payroll tax on that taxable income			2
no heterosexual married couple or their employers pay that penalty			0
again , are we really a nation that says that is fair ? the social and civil discrimination that persists as long as our federal government does not recognize same - sex marriage is inexcusable			1
add in the financial discrimination gay and lesbian couples face and the current policy becomes all the more indefensible .			2

@entity164 : it is progress that a *handful* of states have legalized same - sex marriage
@entity164 : the federal government should make this basic civil right a law of the land
she says gay couples are penalized when it comes to taxes and @entity94 benefits
@entity164 : when will our government end financial , social and civil discrimination ?
