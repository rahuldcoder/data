-- african - americans deserve reparations			1
the idea of reparations -- that the descendants of slaves should be compensated by the national government for the wrongs and the legacy of slavery -- has always been controversial			1
when @entity12 of the @entity13 wrote the june cover story , " @entity15 , " he set a traffic record for the magazine 's website			1
he provoked responses from across the political and ethnic spectrum			0
some of his critics did him the courtesy of reading the entire 16,000 - word piece			0
others , particularly in the @entity26 , reacted viscerally to the headline and to reactions to the headline			1
through many of these responses , whether thoughtful or tossed - off , there 's been a certain thread of uneasiness ; a reflexive move to find reasons why reparation could n't be done or why it would n't be workable or fair			1
to me , this reflex is as interesting as the original argument			0
and it suggests that before @entity43 could ever actually do reparations , @entity43 would have to first be able to imagine the necessity of reparations			1
the greatest obstacle to considering reparation is n't practicality ; it 's a dearth of moral imagination			1
@entity12 makes a powerful and persuasive case			0
he describes not just the obvious injury that demands redress -- namely , slavery -- but also the way in which whites after emancipation systematically and over most of the ensuing 150 years built a nation premised on second - class status for blacks and on supremacy for whites			0
the obvious example is the latticework of code and custom that we call @entity69			0
but as @entity12 reminds us , white supremacy was not just about measures of outright racial subjugation ; it was also baked into measures intended to create wealth and opportunity , like parts of the @entity77 , which contained many devil 's bargains with conservative @entity80 to exempt african - americans			1
and it plays out in today 's criminal justice and incarceration regimes			1
what @entity12 recounts in painstaking detail is an un-whitewashed history of @entity89 citizenship			0
it comes as revelation only if you really did n't want to know the truth			1
anyone black , by telling their family history , could have told you this history and anyone not black could have read about it			0
but his article is in some ways mistitled			0
@entity12 is not quite making a case for reparations			2
he 's making a case for a discussion of reparations			1
he does n't pretend to spell out all the operational policy choices that would have to be made to put reparations into effect			1
the closest he comes to a legislative recommendation is to tout a perennially neglected bill that rep. @entity112 , @entity113 , introduces every session of @entity115 , which calls simply for a public study of the possibility of reparations			2
this is n't a shortcoming of @entity12 ' argument ; it is its purpose			2
what we need to do is to study the issue in earnest			2
to have a hearing , in the deepest sense			2
to listen to the difference between americanness and whiteness , and to notice the manifold ways that whiteness was ( and is ) an identity fabricated from the myth of blackness			0
to be sure , every ethnic group that 's not called white has experienced suffering in @entity89 life			2
but the experience of african - americans is exceptional in its systematic , multigenerational , reverberating effects			0
and it 's exceptional in its centrality to the founding and building of our nation			2
no experience reveals more than the @entity89 - @entity89 experience both the hypocrisy and the possibility of our national creed			0
does any of this answer the question everyone wants to rush to , the question of implementation and how reparations would actually work ? how to decide which people are called " black " or " black enough " to get compensation ? how to allocate reparations ? how to decide how much ? how to decide who decides ? how to begin the process without it leading to the unraveling of every aspect of institutional wealth , privilege and power in our country ? no , @entity12 does n't answer these questions			1
he asks for a hearing			0
and the point of a hearing on reparations -- and making it a civic experience as profound and prismatic as the @entity184 hearing -- is not to get the @entity89 public to " how			2
" it 's to get us to " why			0
" for only when we understand why reparations are justified , even if in good faith we can not yet figure out how or even whether they could be feasible , will we have a shot at being " beyond race			1
" @entity193 said , " teach thy tongue to say ' i do not know ' and thou shalt progress			0
" on a topic as charged as race , and as woven into the warp and woof of @entity89 identity as whiteness , the temptation is always to speak emphatically from fear or pain			0
but if more of us in reaction to reparations simply say , " i do not know -- but i wish to understand , " then we will be making true progress .			1

the @entity13 's june cover story about reparations generated *strong* reactions
@entity215 : there 's a reflexive move to find reasons why reparation could n't be done
he says whether reparations are feasible or not , we should at least discuss the issue
*liu* : when we understand why reparations make sense will we get to " beyond race "
