think the only world - class @entity1 carnival takes place in @entity4 ? not even close			2
@entity7 ' vibrant @entity6 summer festival , which once marked the end of the sugar crop harvest and a celebration for slaves , has evolved into the greatest representation of the island 's saucy spirit			1
this year 's party wrapped on august 4 , with the usual smash of color , costumes , music , food and unique history from one of the @entity24 's easternmost islands			1
crop over events range from historic remembrances such as the @entity28 of the @entity29 , where plantation - era traditions are on display , to @entity32 , in which participants slather each other in mud , paint and powder , to @entity37 , in which revelers wine the day away in scanty costumes of feathers and beads , grooving to soca music			0
as the photo gallery above shows , the 21 - mile - long island of @entity7 may be small in size , but its unique spin on carnival is proof of its fervor .			0
