@entity0 -- after two days of meetings and talks led by president @entity7 and secretary of state @entity8 , @entity3 and @entity4 leaders leave @entity0 deadlocked over the contentious issue of @entity3 settlements			0
@entity3 prime minister @entity11 and @entity13 president @entity12 met alone behind closed doors for more than an hour and a half thursday in a @entity17 room just outside @entity19 's office			1
the one - on - one meeting followed their on - camera pledges to move the peace process forward and their hardy handshake with @entity19 in the middle			0
but several diplomatic sources involved in the summit said the two leaders emerged from their meeting in a stalemate over whether @entity3 settlements should continue			1
the two leaders met with @entity19 to give a readout of their meeting			1
according to @entity33 , who accompanied @entity12 , the two leaders were very blunt about their opposing views			1
@entity11 is under pressure from the @entity4 and the @entity7 administration to extend a 10 - month moratorium on building @entity3 settlements in the disputed @entity39 territory			1
that moratorium is set to expire september 26			0
@entity11 's conservative coalition government wants the @entity3 prime minister to end the moratorium			1
@entity33 said that during the leaders ' private discussion , @entity12 asked @entity11 to extend the settlement freeze			1
@entity11 reportedly said , " i can not extend			2
" @entity33 says @entity12 responded , " then i can not continue			2
" before the summit even began , @entity12 had threatened to abandon final status talks if @entity11 allowed @entity3 settlements to go forward			1
the @entity4 leader is trying to show he 'll keep his word			0
@entity33 said @entity19 was asked about what would happen if @entity3 continued to expand the controversial @entity52 settlements			0
@entity33 said @entity19 responded , as @entity7 had publicly stated , " then all bets are off			0
" despite the standoff between the @entity4 and @entity3 leadership , @entity33 said that starting sunday , their chief negotiators will meet on a daily basis to try to entertain compromises			2
according to @entity62 , @entity3 and @entity4 officials , the hope is that during those talks , some trust and confidence will be developed , and some of the other issues will be settled , possibly making it easier to find a formula for extending the moratorium			0
the issue could then be discussed when @entity11 and @entity12 meet again in @entity72 on september 14 and 15			1
both sides , and the @entity62 , fully expect some formula to be found at the last minute to extend the moratorium , the officials said			2
@entity7 told the leaders not to ruin this opportunity , according to the sources , and to make sure the 26th of september goes by quietly without incident while nothing was agreed to , officials from both sides said the tone of this week 's talks was fairly decent , and they expressed cautious optimism			0
@entity11 was apparently in a good mood after the meetings , and @entity12 , who was nervous and tense the night before the talks , seemed to come away from them in a better mood			1
he did n't feel pressured as he has been recently and was appearing to aides to be a little more relaxed and confident , they said			0
@entity33 said @entity12 would be visiting @entity93 and @entity94 to drum up support for the @entity4 people			2
