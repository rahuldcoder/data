investigators with the @entity45 announced sunday that the @entity47 - era plane was equipped with data and video recording devices that they hope to use to help determine what happened and why			1
@entity45 member @entity51 described the devices , as well as the discovery of information and pieces that may have come from the devices , as " significant new information			1
" it was also not entirely expected , given the relatively small size and nature of the p - 51 aircraft			0
" i 'm not aware of a lot of aircraft having it ; this is the first one i came across , " said @entity62 , the @entity45 official heading the investigation			1
@entity67 was referring to a " box " that recorded key variables such as altitude , latitude and oil pressure			0
in addition , there was an outward - facing video camera on the plane , according to @entity51			1
several memory cards have been found at the wreckage site that may have come from either device and will be sent to the @entity45 laboratory in @entity31 for a full analysis , @entity51 said			1
they may belong to some of the 200,000 spectators who were at the annual @entity86 and @entity87			0
investigators do have a copy of the " box " data , since it was sent in real time by telemetry to sources outside the aircraft			1
besides the cards , @entity51 said , parts of a plane 's tail , an " elevator trim tab " and video camera fragments have been found			1
" there were thousands of pieces of debris , " @entity62 said , explaining how the site had been laid out in a grid system to help organize the investigation			0
as with the memory cards , one of the authorities ' first goals will be to determine whether these came from the plane			0
countering earlier reports , @entity51 said sunday that @entity19 did not send a " @entity114 , " indicating he was in distress			0
investigators have repeatedly stated that it is not known why the aircraft nosedived			1
some speculation has surrounded the elevator trim tab , which was breaking apart prior to the crash , a photograph shows			0
investigators also will pore over " a tremendous ( amount of ) video that was captured " at the scene , according to @entity51			1
a preliminary report will be available friday , but @entity51 has said the full investigation could take six to nine months			0
" it 's not just what happened , it 's why it happened , " he said sunday			0
" ( we 're ) trying to make sure this does n't happen again			0
