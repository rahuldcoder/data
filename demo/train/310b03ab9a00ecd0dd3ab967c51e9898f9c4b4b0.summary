the war 's anniversary provided an opening for leaders of the two nations to begin a new round of verbal sparring , which has erupted over the islands in the past several months -- with prince @entity46 's six - week deployment to the islands in february and march as a high - profile backdrop			1

" i think it 's a mistake for @entity7 to be protectionist			2
i think it 's a mistake for @entity7 to start trade wars			2
i think it 's a mistake for @entity7 to have any sort of suggestion at all that they are considering coercing the people of the @entity5 into a political arrangement against their will , " he told @entity0			1
" i think @entity7 ( is ) making a number of political miscalculations , but obviously that 's the choice that they 're making			2
it 's not a choice that we 're making			0
