@entity0 -- it 's been widely reported			1
the @entity3 is locked in battle			1
establishment @entity3 are being challenged by insurgents hoping to purify the brand and return the @entity3 to small government , free market principles			1
the conservative grassroots are organizing this election season to elect their preferred , ideologically pure candidate , even if that means unseating @entity14 and @entity15 incumbents			1
it 's a strategy they had in 2010 and 2012 with mixed results			2
but too much emphasis might be placed on the internal strife			1
because if money has anything to do with it , which it does , the battle is more like a fight between @entity25			2
@entity3 establishment chooses electability over purity the three main groups working to unseat a handful of incumbents are the @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			1
a few of the incumbents they want to unseat : sens. @entity38 of @entity39 , the chamber 's @entity3 leader , and @entity42 of @entity43			1
also on their list is rep. @entity46 of @entity47			2
@entity49 's re-election bid one of the key 2014 races they have raised a nice chunk of cash			2
combined , the groups ' super pacs , which have different agendas and are only being lumped together because of their influence and effectiveness and their ability to raise unlimited amounts of campaign cash , have spent about $ 15 million in the past 15 months			1
that 's not an insignificant amount and that 's a good portion of the nearly $ 50 million spent by all outside groups combined this midterm election season			1
but @entity67 of the @entity68 said campaign spending is already ahead of this point in 2012 , the most expensive campaign season in history			1
" no matter of how you look at it , we 're well ahead of where we were at the last midterms and also the last election , " he said			2
but the thing is that the incumbents they are trying to beat are raising even more cash			2
political strategists agree that incumbents are much more prepared this time around			2
for instance , @entity49 has amassed a war chest of $ 20 million and he 's already spent $ 10 million -- that 's almost more than the three groups combined - for his may 20 primary			2
and those groups are involved in a dozen different races			0
making it that much more difficult in the money race is that @entity49 's cash does n't include the outside groups that support him			0
" sometimes we can compete against them and sometimes we ca n't , " @entity100 , the @entity101 of @entity34 , said			0
" sometimes we win and sometimes we do n't			0
" while @entity49 has raised and spent an enormous amount so far -- more than any other candidate , @entity3 incumbents with more modest resources are still operating at an advantage			1
2014 @entity108 : what 's at stake of all the incumbents being challenged , @entity42 is expected to be in the most danger of losing			0
he is currently winning the cash contest , however			0
he and the flushest super pac backing him have spent about $ 2.6 million ahead of the june 3 primary			0
his challenger , @entity118 , and the groups backing him have spent about $ 1.7 million			0
and in @entity47 , where rep. @entity46 is facing off against @entity121 , @entity120 has spent more than $ 1 million while @entity121 , who has received the endorsements of many non-establishment groups , has spent only $ 550,000 for their may 20 primary			1
people who financially back efforts to oust incumbents they consider unfit believe their money is well - placed , even if their candidate does n't win			0
@entity100 refers to @entity49 's race : " he 's going to spend $ 10 to $ 15 million in this primary convincing the voters he 's the person we want him to be			0
his voting record has become more conservative			0
his rhetoric has become more fiscally conservative			0
in my mind that 's a win			0
" incumbents have built - in advantages			0
senators have a six year campaign cycle and raise money for their next election for all six years			1
in addition , they often have access to the established network of party donors and influence peddlers			0
many independent groups , such as the super pacs and 501c4s , did n't even exist in 2010 when the @entity155 opened the flood gates to independent spending with the @entity159 decision			1
but they are learning quickly and each campaign season the top groups raise more			1
@entity67 said the influx of cash into campaigns has adverse consequences			0
" it 's basically become the permanent campaign , " he said			1
