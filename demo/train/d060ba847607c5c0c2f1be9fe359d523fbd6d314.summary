@entity2 , are you getting a new sex theme park or just teasing us ? the word on the street -- or on the internet at least -- is that plans are afoot to develop an erotic entertainment attraction on the island 's @entity10			1
after interest was aroused by details posted on the region 's official website , however , the page was quickly taken down			1
the park 's administration director , @entity17 , confirmed with @entity1 that the proposal is real , but he insists it 's just a concept at this point			1
" the ideal plan is to realize the proposal within this year if we can gain support from the local government , " said @entity17			2
details of the plan , circulated by a user on @entity2 's popular @entity32 online bulletin board , outlined a " @entity34 " sightseeing route with four zones stretching across three counties			1
each stage has a different theme : " dating paradise , " " scenic spot for wedding gowns , " " silk road of love " and a proposed 10,000 - meter - square " sex theme park			1
" the sex theme park -- or " @entity47 " as it 's called in the proposal -- will be modeled after other erotic parks around the world including @entity51 's @entity50 in @entity52 and @entity53 in @entity54 , @entity55			1
claiming to be educational , the park will serve as the final stop of the four - stage journey of love			2
it 'll be divided into different sections , covering topics including sex positions , unusual sex lives and sex toys			1
" the dating paradise is perfect for those who are more than friends but are n't officially a couple yet , " the proposal said			2
@entity17 said that the proposal should n't have been made public before being finalized , but insisted , if realized , that it will help regenerate a neglected area			2
" the southwestern coast of @entity2 has been an important salt farm since the @entity75 , " he says			2
" it has a unique background , culture and ecological value			0
yet , a decade after it was declared a national scenic area , it still has n't received much attention from tourists			0
so we thought to ourselves , is it time to try a new mode of thinking ? " the white powdery salt hill and salt farm have always emitted a romantic feeling for visitors coming to the area , " said @entity17			0
" that 's why we came up with the idea to be the first dating / wedding - themed park in @entity2			1
" the proposal generated heated debate online			2
" this is the first time i find a government proposal interesting , " said one online critic , according to @entity2 's @entity99			1
another said : " we surpass @entity103			0
" " this is too out of line , " posted another			0
" and soon the government will start promoting sex tourism			0
" @entity109 , the deputy commissioner for @entity110 , the sex park 's proposed home , told the @entity112 that the idea may not be suitable for traditional - minded locals			1
@entity17 said he 'd received mostly supportive comments , but he welcomed different opinions			0
" sex has always been a taboo in @entity120 society , " he added			0
" but it 's a part of our lives and a very natural thing -- why ca n't we discuss it openly and generously ? " aside from the sex park , the rest of the proposal makes use of existing attractions			1
" we 're planning to add around 100 landmarks and installations to each of stage to enrich the experience , " said @entity17			0
the proposed route starts at the scenic six - story - high salt hill in @entity138			0
it then leads to @entity140 , a place famous for its vibrant pre-wedding photo - shooting industry , where " churches " and dozens of other romantic landmarks are built for that purpose			0
the third destination , @entity147 , is a fishing town in @entity149			0
the proposal calls it the right place to take your oath before heading to the sex theme park .			1
