-- @entity1 overcame adverse weather and fading light to secure his first tour triumph since 2011 at @entity5 at @entity6			1
the 29 - year - old @entity7 was on the 14th green and three shots ahead of second - placed @entity10 at 15 - under - par when play was suspended due to heavy rain and thunder late on sunday			1
a double bogey on the 15th when play resumed 90 minutes later , however , made for a tense finish			2
but @entity1 held par and his nerve with a monster putt on the 17th , a score he matched at the 18th as darkness descended to secure a 13 - under - par one shot victory			2
" it was difficult to come back after a little break , " he told @entity24 as he reached the clubhouse			0
" you are really disappointed when they call it ... and then you 're a little cold			0
" " i made a couple of wrong decisions on 15 and 16 but what a putt on 17			0
" @entity1 had golf 's led " fifth major " all week having carded a record equaling round of 63 on thursday			1
but he was clawed back by the young @entity37 , @entity38 , on saturday and the pair started level on sunday at 13 - under - par. @entity38 , who lit up the masters where he finished in a tie for second earlier this year , had not dropped a shot all week on the challenging @entity46 course but came unstuck at the fifth hole sunday where he carded his first bogey			0
the 20 - year - old @entity49 then dropped two further shots on the eighth and the tenth and appeared to grow frustrated as the day wore on , falling away to finish in a tie for fourth with @entity53 's @entity52			0
@entity10 was coolness personified by comparison , shooting six birdies in a round of 66 to move into second place give himself a chance at 12 - under - par as @entity1 headed back out onto the course			1
alas , it was not to be as @entity1 held his nerve to take the @entity63 glass trophy and $ 1.8 million first prize			2
@entity38 's disappointing final round meant @entity67 's @entity66 was able to sneak into third position with a birdie at the last			1
elsewhere , @entity70 failed to overtake @entity71 atop the world rankings after a final round of 73 ensured he finished outside the top 30			1
the @entity75 required at least a top 16 finish to become world no. 1 this week but will now likely claim the top spot next week without playing due to the way the rankings are calculated .			0

@entity1 wins at @entity6 after *dramatic* final days play
@entity7 *won* by one stroke from @entity10
rain delay meant @entity1 was playing in the dark by the time he finished his round
