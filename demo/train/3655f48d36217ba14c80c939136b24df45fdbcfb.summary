-- if you 're going to photograph @entity3 , she 's going to make sure you get the full picture			1
so , in the september issue of @entity7 , that meant getting in a breast - feeding photo as well			1
the 30 - year - old actress attended the shoot with her infant son , @entity12 , whom she welcomed with fiance @entity13 in april			1
in one image , she feeds her firstborn in a diner while wearing a @entity18 gown -- which , ok , is n't exactly how she does it at home			2
@entity3 , @entity13 welcome baby boy " being shot with @entity12 is so perfect because any portrait of me right now is n't complete without my identity as a mother being a part of that , " @entity21 explained			1
" breast - feeding is the most natural thing			1
i do n't know , now it feels like @entity12 should always be on my breast			1
" to @entity21 , the photograph depicts " that multifaceted woman " that " we know we can be , " she went on			2
" you can be someone who is at once maternal and professional and sexy and self - possessed , " @entity21 said			2
" ( but ) i mean , i certainly do n't really look like that when i 'm ( typically ) breast - feeding			1
and there 's usually a diaper involved			2
" after the pictures were shared online , @entity21 joked via @entity43 that " @entity12 ordered milkshakes			1
luckily i had some on me			0
then he peed on my dress			0
" she also thanked @entity7 for " knowing there 's nothing indecent about feeding a hungry baby			1
" as far as her relationship with @entity12 ' dad , actor and " @entity56 " alum @entity13 , @entity21 sounds just as content as she looks in her photo			2
" we 're engaged , but no specific plans yet , " @entity21 said			0
" we just have to find the time to put it together			0
in many ways , a child is more of a commitment			0
we are fully committed and really happy as a family			0
and there 's no definition of the ' normal family ' anymore			0
kids today are growing up with so many different definitions of family			0
i guess what i 'm saying is that i do n't feel any pressure to do it			0
but i think it will be really fun			0
