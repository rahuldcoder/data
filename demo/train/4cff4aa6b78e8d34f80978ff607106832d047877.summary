in the run - up to the @entity4 elections , two pieces of conventional wisdom were making the rounds among analysts , diplomats and experts : first , @entity9 would win big , and second , the victory would propel him on a collision course with @entity12 , a second term president seeking to do something serious on the peace issue			1
the first proved to be dead wrong			0
the second will probably follow suit			0
" @entity9 " @entity9 has just been re-elected prime minister , no less for the third time			1
but do n't get out the popcorn and turn out the lights just yet			0
the sequel to the @entity12 - @entity9 wars is n't about to begin			1
sure , their relationship has been perhaps the most dysfunctional in the history of @entity28 - @entity4 ties			2
and there are bound to be plenty of downs in the next several years , particularly if @entity9 is forced to form a narrow right - wing governing coalition			2
but the @entity28 - @entity4 relationship is simply too big and important to fail , particularly now			2
@entity9 's party wins but centrists flex muscle , polls show indeed , given the real prospects that the new @entity4 coalition will include @entity42 's centrist party ( whose surprise showing of 19 seats may make him a coalition lynchpin ) and maybe another moderate faction if @entity42 wo n't sit with other right - wingers in the coalition , the two leaders may have less reason to fight and more reasons to cooperate			1
second term illusion the notion that a second - term president freed from the constraints of re-election will now hammer an @entity4 prime minister with a big peace initiative just does n't add up			1
first , there 's no precedent for such a thing in @entity28 policy toward the @entity63 - @entity4 negotiations			1
@entity65 's push at @entity66 in july 2000 -- the precedent most often cited -- came not from @entity65 , but at then - prime minister @entity69 's urging			1
second , it 's the presence of opportunity , not the absence of political constraints or the desire to get even and settle scores , that leads a @entity28 president to act			0
a quick look around and any sentient human being would see that a grand deal between @entity4 and @entity80 is n't possible now			2
@entity42 's presence in the coalition may restrain some of the @entity4 right 's ambitions to expand settlements , but it is n't enough to support a full - scale push toward a comprehensive peace			1
@entity42 's focus was on economic issues and national service , not on negotiations with the @entity80			0
the suspicions between @entity4 and @entity80 are too deep , the gaps on the issues too big , and the political houses on each side too divided			2
more likely , the new @entity9 government will focus on some kind of interim accord with the @entity80			2
and that leads us to the second reason that a big fight is likely not in the offing			0
why fight about nothing ? fighting with an @entity4 prime minister ( and the @entity63 , too ) is a part of the job description of serious @entity28 mediators			1
but the fight needs to be productive and worth the effort			0
right now , there 's nothing to fight about because there 's no conceivable @entity4 - @entity80 agreement in the offing			1
you fight when you think there 's a way to produce an agreement that would justify the risks of a confrontation , not when you 're certain to fail			0
for @entity12 , whose domestic agenda will require an enormous expenditure of political capital at home , neither fighting with @entity129 and @entity130 over pressure on @entity4 nor launching an initiative that fails is smart politics			1
@entity134 needs a friend we are going to have a new secretary of state who will have responsibility -- assuming he can convince the president to let him handle the issue -- for dealing with the @entity4 - @entity80 problem			2
the last thing @entity134 wants is a worsening of ties between @entity12 and @entity9 that makes it impossible for him to do his job on such a key issue			1
if @entity134 wants to have a chance of succeeding -- even to manage the problem -- he 'll need a relationship with @entity9 based on some measure of confidence and trust			2
this is even more important given the absence of such trust between @entity12 and the prime minister			1
@entity157 41 and then - prime minister @entity158 did n't get along			1
@entity159 managed to hammer out a working relationship with @entity158 , tense at times but functional			0
without it , there would have been no @entity164 peace talks			0
if @entity134 is smart , he 'll keep the door to @entity9 open and try to see if he ca n't reach some understanding with the prime minister			1
if he ca n't , there will be plenty of time to fight later			0
the @entity173 issue the big reason why @entity9 and @entity12 will likely have a stake this time around in more cooperation and less friction is @entity173			1
the fact is neither @entity12 , the mullahs , nor @entity9 wants a war over the nuclear issue			1
but avoiding one will require the closest of cooperation between @entity185 and @entity186			0
there 's an expectation that 2013 will be the year of decision on the @entity173 nuclear issue			0
maybe yes , maybe no. but that expectation alone will require intimate coordination to prevent a unilateral @entity4 strike , to see whether diplomacy can produce an @entity173 - @entity28 deal and to determine whether it can be sold to @entity4			2
if not , and no diplomatic fix to the nuclear issue is possible , @entity28 - @entity4 understandings will be required on a military option			0
either way , neither the @entity28 nor @entity4 can avoid a public falling out over @entity173 or a major split over how to manage the problem			0
simply put , the @entity28 - @entity4 relationship is too big to fail			0
that does n't mean there wo n't be real differences over settlements , for example , that wo n't cause friction			0
but on the two biggest issues of the day , how to manage @entity173 and the @entity80 , there ca n't be solutions without close @entity4 - @entity28 cooperation			1
this is @entity12 's last term as president and perhaps @entity9 's last term as prime minister			1
@entity12 does n't want to be the @entity28 president on whose watch @entity173 crossed the nuclear weapons threshold and certainly neither does @entity9 want to be the @entity4 prime minister held responsible			1
it would be nice to imagine that the two can sit down and reach a broad strategic understanding -- first we deal with @entity173 , and if we succeed through diplomacy or even war , then let 's find a way to preserve the two - state option for @entity4 and the @entity80			2
but even if this does n't happen , these two leaders are inexorably bound together			0
they 're never going to love each other			0
but i 'm betting they 'll find a way to get by without a major fight neither wants			0
the fact is the protection of @entity4 and @entity28 interests and regional stability in a volatile , turbulent @entity243 depends on it .			0

@entity9 is headed for third term as @entity4 's prime minister
@entity249 : results of election mean he will likely ally with moderate faction
he says that *dynamic* will *reinforce* need for close cooperation between @entity12 , @entity9
@entity249 : the two leaders may not like each other , but they need each other now
