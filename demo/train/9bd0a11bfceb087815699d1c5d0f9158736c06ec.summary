for one , it was a health scare			1
for another , the words of a friend hit him in an instant			1
and for another , it was the loss of a dear relative			2
many ex-smokers can remember their last cigarette , and the moment when they decided to quit the habit for good			1
on the occasion of thursday 's @entity14 , an annual event sponsored by the @entity15 , here 's a look at nine former smokers and the moment they decided it was time to say goodbye			1
' smoked out of good health ' @entity22 's 66 - year - old grandmother had just died			1
@entity22 took one final drag on a cigarette			1
it was 2000 , and she decided this would be her last smoke			1
" i was shocked because this woman was an ox who smoked four packs of @entity36 cigarettes a day and worked full time as a nurse , " said the @entity29 resident , who was 23 at the time			2
" i always felt safe that this blood line relative could smoke like a chimney and still be ok all these years later			1
she looked 100 but acted 60			2
" but , " the reality of it is that she fell ill with pneumonia and her lungs could n't support her any longer			2
" as she finished her last cigarette , @entity22 reflected on how she got there			1
the social aspect of it , the taste of it , the way it made me feel -- everything about it was romantic to me			2
" but the death of her grandmother was the " straw that broke the camel 's back " soon after @entity22 herself was diagnosed with an aggressive form of strep throat , and she has n't looked back for 13 years			2
" i 've had smoking dreams that felt so intimately real that the line of reality and fantasy blurred out my memory			2
i know i did n't smoke but sometimes those dreams feel really good and sometimes with real regret			1
" when ' trying to fit in ' led to a health scare @entity73 ' last cigarette is a blur compared to the " health perfect storm " she was hit with in 2005			1
at first , it seemed like a winter flu , but as the new year came , she found she could n't breathe unless she sat in a chair			2
she was almost too late to be treated			2
" i ended up in the hospital for 12 days with two chest tubes and the potential of having my chest cracked open just to get the ' gunk ' out of my chest			0
i was lucky to get back to health and avoid surgery			1
my recovery was long and tedious			0
" her husband had never seen her so sick			0
" the look of panic and helplessness convinced me that i had to stop			0
" like many former smokers , it was the last of many potential turning points for the @entity29 health care consultant , who started smoking as a teenager to fit in			1
the first was having a baby , the second and third moments were her mother 's stroke ( at age 50 ) and grandmother 's heart attack			0
" it took me a while to realize i was a stress and social smoker , " she said			0
" pressure from work and going out to happy hours fueled my habit , but smoking made me feel better for just a moment			0
what is worse is that i knew better			1
i worked in health care and saw the effects of long - term smoking			1
" " i ca n't say that i do n't crave it - especially when i am stressed out			0
i do have to constantly remind myself of the pain and the feeling of drowning because i could n't breathe to keep me from running out and getting a pack			0
it is a very mental game i play every day but i get stronger and stronger every day without a cigarette			1
" words that changed his life when @entity131 smoked his last cigarette , he knew right away that this was it			1
the words from one of his friends " hit me like a ton of bricks			1
" after a gradual process of trying to quit in 2006 , she said , " you know , @entity131 , there never is a good day to quit smoking , is there ? " the @entity147 , @entity148 , assembly instructor admits , " there are still times when i think that i would like a smoke but there is no way that i will do it			1
... i do feel better and definitely smell better			0
" quitting ' at any age ' @entity156 ( the @entity157 did not want her last name revealed ) of @entity159 , @entity160 , smoked her final cigarette as soon as she learned that airlines were banning it			1
a frequent flier , she could n't bear to remain addicted while flying , and knew she was unable to do anything about it			1
so on july 9 , 1992 , after seven years of smoking two packs a day , she quit for good			1
" i have not had a cigarette since that day , but when someone lights up near me i take a deep breath , " she said			1
" that first puff of smoke off a cigarette still gets me , but then everything afterwards repels me			1
i am the worst ex-smoker , i ca n't stand to be around anyone who smokes or has smoked nor get into an enclosed space with a smoker			0
" she was very concerned when her daughter took up smoking , afraid she would fall into the same habits			0
but as we reported this story , she had good news to share			1
" i am elated to report that my daughter has quit smoking and using the new electronic vapor cigarettes that are out there			2
she is not coughing as much as she used to and her voice is clearer			0
i really hope that these vapor cigarette products do not create any health hazards that have not been discovered yet			1
in the meantime i encourage her to stick with the vapor and stay away from the cancer sticks			0
" a @entity194 's present to himself pizza restaurant owner @entity196 makes themed pies to show how he feels about a certain topic			1
he recently made one with a " no smoking " symbol to remind himself of february 14 , 1985			0
on that @entity201 , @entity196 tossed his final cigarette into a barrel			1
he was quitting a habit of smoking two packs a day for 20 years , going back to age 13			0
" i was positive and determined that this would be my last cigarette , " he said			2
" i would buy two packs a day and sometimes run out			0
then i would bum some from my co-worker			0
one day , i asked to bum a cigarette from her and she said to me , ' why do n't you just buy more cigarettes ? ' that 's when i really realized that i had a serious problem			2
i said to myself , that 's it , i have to do something about this			0
" so why @entity201 ? " i picked this day because i knew if i succeeded i would always be able to remember the day i stopped smoking , " the @entity219 , @entity220 , resident explained			1
he felt a weight lifted off his shoulders and still feels that way 28 years later			0
" when i was smoking and played sports my chest felt like it was going to cave in and it was hard to breathe			0
now i do n't get that bad feeling because i do n't smoke anymore			2
needless to say , i have a lot more money in my pocket than i would if i had to pay the high price of what cigarettes cost			0
" cinnamon and cigarettes her final cigarette was one she saw coming , and @entity240 was ready to take the dive			1
after a three week course sponsored by the @entity243 , she had to give up her cigarettes and her lighter			0
she took that final smoke , then moved on to cinnamon hearts , jawbreakers and the like to fulfill the need for the hot cigarette sensation			1
she was determined to do it , though , after her mother received her sixth pacemaker and her father was diagnosed with prostate cancer			0
her son had been diagnosed with @entity256 , which affects the hips			0
doctors told her it may have come from her smoking			0
" my first two weeks ( not smoking ) were easy but then on the third week , i felt like i was going to die			0
i had n't slept much , was n't dreaming , was super irritable and ate like a pig			0
" that was 20 years ago			0
yet she continued to struggle for many of those years			0
" it took me years to stop dreaming about having a cigarette and sometimes i would wake up and not be sure if i had smoked , " she said			2
" luckily , i have never had another cigarette , not even a puff			2
" the retired @entity268 , @entity269 , resident told herself she could return to smoking at age 65			0
yet @entity272 just turned 65 this month			0
" it was too difficult to quit and the damage smoking does is n't worth the pleasure it provides			2

on the annual ' @entity14 , ' ex-smokers share the story of their last cigarette
health scares , *pregnancies* and words of *advice* were among the reasons for the final smoke
@entity196 chose @entity201 to quit because he knew he would always remember it
