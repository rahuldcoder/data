-- the @entity1 on sunday condemned the weekend massacre of more than 100 civilians in @entity4 , with members casting blame on government forces for the deaths , while violence continued to rage on the ground			1
@entity1 military observers said the toll from the friday assault on the village of @entity15 included dozens of women and children			2
after consultations sunday afternoon , @entity1 members condemned " attacks that involved a series of government artillery and tank shellings on a residential neighborhood , " as well as the killings of civilians by close - range gunshots and " severe physical abuse			1
" " such outrageous use of force against the civilian population constitutes a violation of applicable international law and of the commitments of the @entity4 government under @entity39 2042 and 2043 to cease violence in all its forms , including the cessation of use of heavy weapons in population centers , " said @entity30 's deputy ambassador @entity29 , who presided over the meeting			1
the members demanded that @entity4 troops immediately pull its troops and heavy weapons back from cities in accordance with an april cease - fire			2
@entity54 's letter to the @entity1 @entity55 , @entity4 's @entity1 ambassador , told reporters the statement was n't blaming his government for all the killings , since the statement left the cause of most deaths ambiguous			1
he said most of the deaths were caused by gunfire , and the council statement did not specifically assign blame for those fatalities			1
and @entity67 , a longtime ally of @entity4 president @entity69 , believes " it still remains unclear what happened and what triggered what , " as @entity67 charge d'affaires @entity73 put it			2
but @entity77 ambassador @entity76 said there was " clear evidence " connecting the government to the deaths			0
" the evidence is not murky , and there is a clear footprint of the government in this massacre , " @entity76 said			2
and @entity85 , the @entity86 deputy ambassador , said a briefing by the head of the @entity1 observer mission in @entity4 " clearly shows the responsibility of the @entity4 government in failing to protect its civilians as well , as attacking them directly			1
" @entity1 observers in @entity4 said the toll from the @entity15 massacre had risen to 108 on sunday , including 34 women and 49 children under the age of 10 , said @entity101 , the observer mission 's spokeswoman			1
horrific images of the bodies in @entity15 spread across the internet , fueling fresh protests by @entity4 opposition groups in several cities			1
videos posted sunday on @entity110 show demonstrations in cities around the country , including @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 , and the suburbs of @entity118			0
" @entity15 , we are with you until death , " protesters chanted in @entity115			0
and a demonstration in @entity116 showed a @entity1 vehicle among protesters			2
in the @entity118 suburbs , demonstrators called for president @entity69 to step down			0
but the 14 - month - old clampdown continued , with opposition activists reporting another 51 people -- including 11 children and four women -- killed across the country on sunday			1
twenty - five of those deaths took place in @entity118 , where heavy shelling was reported , they said			0
opposition activists said killings began with a mortar bombardment following friday prayers , followed by a rampage by government - allied militias			1
@entity144 posted over the weekend showed opposition activists displaying the bloodied remains of more than 10 children , including some with limbs blown off or skulls torn open			1
in another , medics treated a crying infant whose chest was covered in bandages			0
@entity4 has denied its troops were behind the bloodbath in @entity15 , and @entity156 denounced what he called a " tsunami of lies " against his government			1
he called the deaths " an appalling , horrific unjustified and unjustifiable crime " and vowed @entity4 's government had launched a national commission to investigate them			1
" whoever committed these crimes will be held accountable by the @entity4 authorities , by the @entity4 government 's law , " he said			1
in state - run media , the @entity4 regime said " @entity173 - linked terrorist groups committed two horrible massacres against a number of families in the towns of @entity178 and @entity179 in the countryside of @entity182 province			2
" the state report also showed gruesome images of children spattered with blood			0
@entity0 can not independently confirm details from @entity4 nor the authenticity of videos , however , as the @entity4 government strictly limits access by foreign journalists			1
but @entity193 , a reporter for @entity196 's @entity195 television network who was in @entity15 , said its residents appeared to be voting with their feet			0
" there are lots of civilians in the rebel - held areas			0
they are not apparently frightened of the fighters			0
they are speaking openly to the @entity39 , " @entity193 told @entity0			0
" in the areas of the town held by the army , there is nobody -- it 's a ghost town			0
" @entity1 human rights chief @entity215 called for the situation in @entity4 to be referred to the @entity217			1
" there should be an immediate and unfettered investigation of the incident by an independent and impartial international body , " she said			0
" the @entity4 government has a legal and moral responsibility to fully assist such an investigation , and to take concrete steps to prevent any similar acts			1
" the @entity227 - based @entity226 similarly demanded an investigation and echoed the call for the @entity1 to refer @entity4 to the @entity217			1
citing survivors to the violence in @entity15 , the group reported that armed men dressed in military clothes attacked homes and executed families , though witnesses did not know whether the men were members of the army or a pro-government militia			0
the group recounted the experience of a 10 - year - old boy , who saw his 13 - year - old friend shot			0
the @entity4 crisis began in march 2011 , when peaceful demonstrations modeled on the " @entity250 " uprisings in @entity248 and @entity249 sprang up across @entity4			2
@entity252 's government responded by turning police and troops on demonstrators -- but the protests spread across the country , with defecting soldiers taking up up arms on behalf of the opposition			2
a cease - fire agreement , brokered by former @entity263 secretary - general @entity263 's office , has been in place since april 12 as part of a six - point peace plan			0
but col. @entity267 , a spokesman for the rebel @entity268 , said saturday that it was " no longer possible to abide by the peace plan " after the @entity15 killings			0
@entity1 officials say more than 9,000 people , mostly civilians , have died and tens of thousands have been uprooted since the uprising began in march 2011			1
opposition groups report a death toll of more than 11,000 people			2
sunday 's @entity1 session came a day ahead of a scheduled meeting between @entity4 officials and @entity263 , the joint @entity1 - @entity282 special envoy on the crisis			1
meanwhile , @entity196 foreign secretary @entity284 was headed to @entity285 for talks in hopes of putting @entity67 pressure on @entity69			0
" we have had many differences of view with @entity67 at the @entity1 , but @entity67 does support the @entity263 plan , " @entity284 said in a statement from his office			1
" and so i hope @entity67 will redouble its efforts to get the @entity69 regime to implement that plan			0
it 's not in the interests of @entity67 , just as it 's not in the interests of anybody in the world , for @entity4 to descend in to an even bloodier situation and into full scale civil war and that is now the danger			2
" a @entity1 report issued friday said @entity4 forces are still using heavy weapons in many areas despite the april cease - fire , and " the overall level of violence in the country remains quite high " despite the presence of @entity1 monitors			1
monitors have heard the sound of shelling in cities and towns and seen the aftereffects , their report states , while @entity4 authorities say they were coming under fire from rebel troops			2
meanwhile , opposition groups effectively control " significant parts of some cities " the monitors state			0
but the government 's stepped - up security crackdown " has led to massive violations of human rights " by @entity4 troops and pro-government militias , the report states			2
the @entity337 joined the condemnation of the sunday afternoon			0
@entity340 spokesman @entity339 said the @entity337 was horrifed by " credible reports " of the massacre , " including stabbing and ax attacks on women and children			0
" " these acts serve as a vile testament to an illegitimate regime that responds to peaceful political protest with unspeakable and inhuman brutality , " @entity339 said in a written statement .			0

more than 50 people are killed throughout @entity4 on sunday , opposition activists say
@entity1 singles out " government artillery and tank shelling " in massacre
" severe physical abuse , " gunfire also blamed
@entity4 says the statement leaves blame ambiguous , promises to investigate
