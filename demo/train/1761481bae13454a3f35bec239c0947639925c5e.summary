this is what an @entity2 rout looks like in @entity4 : up to 300 troops killed			1
others missing , possibly dead or having fled			0
dozens of military vehicles , from tanks to ambulances , destroyed or seized			0
and the @entity4 military in disarray , so much so the country 's prime minister has sent " anti-terrorism forces ... to hold the negligent ( military ) leaders responsible			1
" what happened sunday east of @entity19 , around military encampments in @entity21 and @entity22 , is bad enough for the @entity4 government			1
yet what makes it worse is that it 's happened before			0
this latest incident was particularly galling because , according to surviving @entity4 soldiers , military commanders did n't follow up on troops ' pleas for airstrikes or other help , and instead stranded them			1
and the fact this is n't an isolated episode raises big questions about whether the @entity4 military is up to the fight against @entity2 and whether other nations -- the @entity40 being chief among them -- should devote manpower and air power to supporting them			1
@entity46 -- the editor of the @entity47 , which provides information and analysis on terrorists and efforts to combat them -- said thursday that those who believe @entity4 troops , like moderate @entity55 opposition forces , can beat back @entity2 fighters on the ground , on their own , are in " for a very rude awakening			1
" " i think the events since the @entity61 invasion , " said @entity46 -- using the term that @entity2 calls itself -- " have shown the @entity4 military is incapable of going toe - to - toe ( with @entity2 )			1
" @entity4 's military has been overrun before @entity2 , which is also sometimes referred to as @entity2 or @entity64 , is n't new to the fighting game			1
it emerged in the early 2000s as @entity66 in @entity4 , developing a grisly reputation for attacking @entity40 and allied forces , assassinating officials and beheading hostages			2
a @entity40 - led push significantly weakened the @entity73 extremist group , which contains some former members of ousted @entity4 dictator @entity76 's military , but did n't wipe it out entirely			1
instead , the group was reborn as @entity2 , then the @entity61 , with a new mission to control as much territory as possible under its strict interpretation of @entity82 law , or @entity83			2
in many ways , @entity2 has succeeded			2
it took advantage of instability in @entity55 to take large swaths of that country			0
and the group advanced into @entity4 , bringing with it its brutal tactics of killing men , women and children who did n't subscribe to its extreme beliefs or just got in the way			2
@entity4 , though , was n't supposed to be @entity55			2
it 's not in the middle of a bloody , complicated , years - long civil war			0
it has a large military that is not being challenged by opposition forces on all sides			0
and , in theory , this armed forces should be somewhat battle - tested from the 2000s			0
yet @entity4 's military has n't always fared well against @entity2			1
the most glaring example came in june , when soldiers and police dropped their weapons and fled their posts in @entity114 , @entity4 's second - largest city			1
militants overrun @entity114 , as @entity4 soldiers flee since then , a lot has changed			2
chief among them : international forces have gotten involved			0
a @entity40 - led coalition has conducted airstrikes against @entity2 targets in @entity4 , and more recently in @entity55 , while calling on allied @entity4 troops to do their part on the ground to turn back the terrorist group			1
but one thing that has n't necessarily changed much is the @entity4 military 's capability to do just that -- as this week 's incident showed			1
soldiers : no response to requests for help in a statement , @entity2 explained that its mobilized fighters overran an @entity4 military checkpoint , destroyed several tanks and cut off the @entity4 military 's supply routes			1
then , its attack really began			0
an injured @entity4 man -- apparently recounting the ordeal in a video posted to @entity146 , though his account could n't wholly be confirmed by @entity148 -- said he was stationed with eight other soldiers on a school 's rooftop when he saw two black humvees drive in and several men , all dressed in black , get out			1
" thinking it was @entity4 special forces , i called my commander ... and he said , ' let me check , ' " the man said			0
@entity157 were n't @entity4 special forces			2
the @entity4 soldier said he eventually engaged the men , claiming he killed four militants before getting shot himself			1
he stayed there for hours , waiting for support			0
" from 2:30 a.m. until 10 a.m. , no one came to help us , " the man said , claiming he kept calling his commander			0
" ... no one responded , and they sent us nothing			0
" another man who said he is an @entity4 soldier , featured in a video posted sunday to @entity146 , described how militants blew up two humvees			1
( @entity2 credited one of these blasts to a @entity176 man who detonated an armored vehicle with two tons of explosives			0
) this second @entity4 soldier said he alerted an @entity4 military leader about the suicide bombing			1
" he said , ' yes , yes , air support is on its way , ' " he added			0
" since i made the call to him until i reached ( a ) base about three hours later , i did not see a single plane			0
" two senior @entity4 senior security officials in @entity190 told @entity148 that 113 troops died in the @entity2 attack on the @entity194 military base and the fate of 78 others is unknown			1
@entity4 security forces tried , but failed , to deliver food and water to nearly 300 more stranded @entity4 soldiers , the officials said			0
@entity2 , meanwhile , claimed that nearly 300 @entity4 troops were killed in the onslaught			1
it also reported destroying 65 @entity4 military vehicles , including 41 humvees , and seizing 37 others			1
can @entity4 forces defeat @entity2 on the ground ? the whole ordeal spurred @entity210 -- who , as @entity4 's prime minister , is also commander in chief of its military -- to issue " orders to detain and interrogate the army commanders of the regiments who showed negligence , " according to a statement issued through his military spokesman			1
@entity220 also called for reinforcements and supplies to the affected area , as well as intensified airstrikes			0
" the ... commander praises the sacrifices made by the security forces stationed in combat positions and defending the homeland against terrorists , noting the battle with @entity2 will end in victory , @entity233 willing , for @entity4 and its people , " the statement said			2
" and @entity2 will be defeated at the hands of the brave men of our security forces			0
" not everyone agrees -- at least given how things stand now on the ground			0
@entity46 notes @entity2 has managed to defeat @entity4 troops , @entity55 troops , other anti-government fighters in @entity55 , " and they 've done it all at the same time			1
" one big thing these militants have going for them , especially compared to @entity4 's military , is their ruthlessness and drive			1
" it 's a level of commitment the @entity4 forces do n't display , " @entity46 said			2
" you ca n't coach aggressiveness			2
" yet the @entity40 and others are counting on what @entity40 rear adm. @entity258 called " competent partners on the ground " to finish off @entity2 and keep it at bay			0
he characterized the @entity4 security forces capabilities thursday as " a mix , " with some doing well and others not			0
but even if there are failures , that does n't mean @entity40 combat troops will be fighting in @entity4 anytime soon			2
" it 's going to be the @entity4 security forces and the @entity274 forces , " said @entity258 , who is @entity270 spokesman			2
" we 're continuing to strike targets in @entity4			0
" how effective will airstrikes be in " degrading and destroying " @entity2 , as @entity40 officials have repeatedly stated is the end goal ? can local ground forces be counted on to do their part ? and how long will this all last ? " we can continue indefinitely , " said retired @entity284 col. @entity283 , a @entity148 analyst who was gen. @entity285 ' executive officer in @entity4 in 2007 and 2008			2
" but ( battling militants like @entity2 ) is like mowing the grass			0
the grass will come back			0

@entity2 fighters attack , overrun @entity4 troops stationed east of @entity19
an @entity4 soldier claims " no one came to help us " for hours after request
another says an @entity4 military leader promised airstrikes that never came
expert : instances like this show @entity4 's military ca n't go " toe - to - toe " with @entity2
