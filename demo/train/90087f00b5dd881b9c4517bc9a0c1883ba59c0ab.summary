-- with pollen and other spring allergens in the air , researchers investigated whether place of birth affected the risk of developing allergies , and the answer turns out to be — yes			0
having an allergic reaction — with its sneezing , wheezing , itchy eyes and runny nose — is an all too familiar experience for many @entity16 , particularly children			1
about 11 % of youngsters suffer from asthma , and up to 20 % may experience some immune - based reaction to allergens such as pollen , dust , animal hair and even foods			0
but this relatively high prevalence seems to be unique to the @entity16 , so researchers delved into whether different environmental exposures , dictated by where children were born , could affect risk of allergic disease			1
reporting in @entity33 , the scientists studied 91,642 kids between the ages 0 to 17 , all currently living in the @entity16 , who participated in the 2007 - 2008 @entity37			1
the children or their parents answered questions about where they were born , and if they were born outside of the country , they were asked to note how long they had lived in the @entity16			1
the researchers also collected medical information about the children 's allergic diseases , including asthma , eczema , hay fever and food allergies			0
@entity0 : bullying over food allergies when they compared place of birth with allergic - disease prevalence , the scientists found that children born outside of the @entity16 were less likely to develop asthma or allergies compared with those born in the @entity16 : 20 % of foreign - born kids developed allergic diseases compared with 34 % of the @entity16 - born children			1
the prevalence of asthma was even lower , with those born outside of the country 47 % less likely to develop the condition than those born in the @entity16			2
even after the researchers accounted for factors that could affect rates of allergies , such as race or ethnicity and socioeconomic status , the strong association between being born in the @entity16 and the higher risk of allergic diseases remained			2
@entity0 : why we 're going nuts over nut allergies in fact , it was clear that the @entity16 environment played some role in the trend , since foreign - born children who had lived in @entity16 for more than 10 years were three times as likely to develop allergic diseases as those who spent less than two years stateside			1
and foreign - born children whose parents were also born outside of the @entity16 seemed to benefit from additional protection from these conditions : 18 % of these children developed allergic disease compared with 33 % of foreign - born children whose parents were born in the @entity16			2
the results confirm those of previous studies that found higher rates of asthma among @entity16 children compared with kids from other countries , and investigators have also reported similar differences in allergic diseases between immigrants and native - born citizens in @entity104 , @entity105 and @entity106			2
what does birthplace have to do with how the immune - system functions ? the most likely explanation could involve the " hygiene hypothesis , " which suggests that improved sanitation methods and efforts to keep germs at bay may deprive young , still - developing immune systems from being trained to recognize and react appropriately to the right types of irritants			1
" the hygiene hypothesis suggests that early - life exposures to infection or an unclean environment may protect against allergies			1
children born and raised outside the @entity16 likely have more and / or different infectious exposures than those born in the @entity16 , " says study author dr. @entity124 of @entity125 in @entity126			2
" that @entity16 cities are ' too clean ' may be overstated			0
however , previous studies suggest that rolling in the dirt from time to time may be a good thing for kids			0
" @entity0 : why kids with known food allergies are still at risk parental behaviors and cultural practices may also play a role			1
" parents born and raised outside the @entity16 may , for example , follow a healthier diet or have foods with a different antigenic profile than typically encountered in the @entity147 diet , " the authors write			0
" some cultures more commonly use spices , such as curcumin , and green tea that have antiallergy and inflammatory properties			0
" such factors could explain why having foreign - born parents seemed to lower risk of allergic disease in their children even further ; the finding held even after the researchers accounted for differences in race , ethnicity , socioeconomic status , and whether or not the child lived in a metropolitan area			0
sneezing and wheezing solutions : surprising ways to relieve spring allergies in terms of what features of the @entity16 lifestyle or culture could be contributing to an increased risk of these diseases , previous studies from the same team of scientists suggested that factors such as climate , obesity , the @entity147 diet and various types of infections could play a role			1
the current study was n't designed to identify which specific environmental factors might be the most influential , but @entity124 says , " one of our goals is to determine which factor [ or factors ] have the greatest impact on allergic disease , and to help develop public - health interventions to decrease rates of allergic disease in the @entity16 " — because those influences would likely be far easier to change than where you 're born			0

the @entity16 environment seems to play some role in the allergy trend
' hygiene hypothesis ' may have something to do with it
parental behaviors and cultural practices may also play a role
