-- with rates as low as $ 36 , these flashy new @entity2 hotels take the convenience of the pod concept and expand it with style			1
qbic hotels have a clever lighting concept -- @entity9 , anyone ? you can pick the color you like , or turn them off altogether			1
@entity14 where : inside terminals at @entity20 's @entity18 and @entity19 airports ( in @entity21 ) , and @entity23 's @entity22			1
the concept : catering to those with a long layover , these glossy , no - nonsense capsule hotels are small but convenient for business travelers -- or someone just looking for a nap and a shower			1
what you get : a windowless room ( about 75 square feet ) that looks like a cruise ship cabin -- there 's a shower , a tv , a fold - out work desk and an overhead storage rack ; @entity42 is free			1
bonus : a 24 - hour room - service menu of snacks and drinks delivered within 15 minutes			2
what it 'll cost : there 's a four - hour minimum , which costs about $ 36 for a standard cabin in the @entity20 locations			1
after that , pay by the hour ( about $ 10 )			1
premium cabins are probably better for shares -- those start at $ 57 for four hours			1
@entity57 where : @entity59 , @entity60 ; @entity61 and @entity23 , the @entity62			0
the concept : a completely self - service hotel			2
you check yourself in at the kiosk and buy everything with your hotel key card			0
what you get : in the center of each room is a @entity72 , a 75 - square - foot enclosed platform for the bed , a bar - like work - and - dine space and the bathroom			2
the lighting is at your discretion -- @entity81 , @entity9 -- it 's all pretty club - like			1
there 's a vending machine in the lobby filled with drinks , locally made snacks such as organic bread and things you may have forgotten -- like neckties			2
what it 'll cost : from $ 91			0
@entity94 where : near @entity23 's schiphol airport and in central @entity23 's posh @entity98 neighborhood , which started taking guests this april			0
the concept : keeping prices down by using prefabricated everything -- the 150 - square - foot rooms are built in a factory , stacked up and then shot through with plumbing and electrical wiring			1
@entity0 wrote about @entity94 in a february 2009 story on boutique hostels			0
@entity0 : see photos of the boutique hostels what you get : only single - bed rooms are offered , each with an ultramodern cylindrical shower			1
use a control panel ( called a moodpad ) to manage the room temperature , blinds , alarm clock , stereo and lighting -- there are clever choices like " i 'm here to party , " with intense colored lighting and dance music			0
there 's also a 24 - hour self - service cafeteria ; if you 're craving a martini , a bartender is on duty in the evenings			2
what it 'll cost : from $ 109			0
expansion plans all three of these mini chains have plans to expand -- some more than others			0
