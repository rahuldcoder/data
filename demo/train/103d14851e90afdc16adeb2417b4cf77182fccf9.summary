@entity0 -- president @entity2 said tuesday that he invited @entity4 and @entity5 leaders from both chambers of @entity7 to the @entity8 for a meeting thursday to discuss deficit reduction and the need to raise the federal debt ceiling			1
@entity2 said he wanted the meeting to " build on the work that 's already been done and drive toward a final agreement " that would address expanding federal deficits and bring congressional approval for increasing how much money the government can borrow			2
senate minority leader @entity20 , who earlier invited @entity2 to come to @entity7 to discuss the issue , will attend the @entity8 meeting , his office announced			2
senate majority leader @entity23 also plans to attend , and @entity8 speaker @entity24 indicated that he will take part but warned that @entity7 will not accept tax increases sought by @entity2 and @entity4			1
" i 'm happy to discuss these issues at the @entity8 , but such discussions will be fruitless until the president recognizes economic and legislative reality , " @entity24 , @entity27 , said in a statement			1
he added , " i 'm pleased the president stated today that we need to address the big , long - term challenges facing our country			0
" according to @entity2 , who made an unscheduled appearance in the @entity8 briefing room , talks on deficit reduction over the @entity39 weekend with congressional leaders from both parties made progress , but " we still have to work through some real differences			1
" both parties need to come out of their " comfort zone , " @entity2 said			0
but " this should not come down to the last second			0
" @entity8 spokesman @entity50 later said @entity2 believes that everyone knows the issues involved in forging a comprehensive agreement to reduce federal deficits by as much as $ 4 trillion in the coming decade			1
now it is time make hard decisions , with both sides compromising in order to reach an agreement that benefits the nation as a whole , @entity50 said			0
" the ideal will never become law , whether you 're a conservative @entity8 @entity5 or a @entity65 or the president of the @entity67 , " @entity50 said			2
" you 're never going to get everything you want , because our system does n't work like that			0
" the @entity72 returned to work tuesday , cutting short the planned weeklong @entity39 recess , with its leaders resuming their tough talk on negotiations to cut federal deficits amid a looming deadline to raise the government 's debt ceiling			1
the three - day @entity39 weekend did little to change the rhetoric of recent weeks over deficit reduction talks and the need for @entity7 to increase the amount of money the government can borrow			0
in his opening remarks after the @entity72 reconvened , @entity23 , @entity87 , accused @entity5 of putting the nation 's economic recovery at risk by threatening to oppose an increase in how much money the government can borrow			1
@entity95 , @entity96 , followed @entity23 by accusing @entity4 of wanting to increase spending to solve a deficit problem			0
before @entity2 's invitation , @entity95 repeated an invitation for @entity2 to come to @entity7 and hear from @entity5 why they wo n't support any agreement that includes tax increases			1
@entity23 said his side was willing to compromise but would not allow republicans to put the needs of " a few millionaires and billionaires " ahead of the rest of the country			2
with @entity8 members scheduled to return wednesday , congressional leaders remain at sharp odds over what sort of conditions should be attached to a hike in the current $ 14.3 trillion ceiling			1
@entity5 are refusing to go along with any increase unless it includes deep spending cuts and avoids any tax increases			1
@entity4 are trying to minimize the impact of cuts to social services and are calling for the elimination to certain tax breaks and loopholes benefiting wealthier @entity67			2
@entity128 officials and leading economists have warned of potentially catastrophic consequences if the ceiling is not raised by august 2 , at which point the country could default on its debt obligations			1
among other things , the country could face skyrocketing interest rates and a plummeting dollar			0
increasing the debt ceiling will allow the government to borrow more money in order to pay for spending already accrued			1
given the short time frame , @entity7 and the @entity8 may be forced to agree to a relatively small increase in the debt ceiling covering only a few months			1
such a compromise -- including cuts already agreed to on both sides of the aisle -- would give leaders more time to negotiate serious budget reforms , including possible changes to popular entitlement programs such as @entity153 and @entity154			2
however , @entity2 said he 's opposed to a short - term increase in the debt ceiling			1
" i do n't think the @entity67 people sent us here to avoid tough problems , " @entity2 said			2
the debt ceiling dispute is a " ' unique opportunity to do something big " and put the " economy on a stronger footing for the future			1
" over the weekend , top @entity4 and @entity5 gave no public indication that a potential compromise is in the offing			0
talks led by vice president @entity169 recently collapsed over the tax dispute			2
" the principle of not raising taxes is something that we campaigned on last november , and the results of the election was the @entity67 people do n't want their taxes raised and they wanted us to cut spending , " sen. @entity171 , @entity172 , said sunday on @entity1 's " @entity173			0
" " they do n't want compromise			0
" various frameworks for a possible deal have been floated			0
conservatives demand deep spending cuts , caps on future spending and a balanced budget amendment to the @entity191 in return for their support to raise the debt ceiling			1
both the @entity8 and @entity72 are planning votes on a balanced budget amendment in coming weeks			1
however , with such an amendment requiring approval from a two - thirds majority in both chambers and then ratification by at least 38 states , eventual approval is unclear in a process that can take years			0
for his part , @entity2 has chided congressional republicans for refusing to make " tough decisions " at odds with their conservative base			2
he calls for what he characterizes as a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes more revenue for education , infrastructure and clean energy , areas he considers critical to long - term economic growth			0
the @entity4 position includes spending cuts elsewhere , including the military , as well as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as @entity153 and @entity154 , the government - run health care programs for senior citizens , the disabled and the indigent			0
@entity5 seek more sweeping entitlement reforms that @entity4 contend would eliminate the safety net the programs were intended to provide			0
@entity1 's @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 and @entity234 contributed to this report			0
