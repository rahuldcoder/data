@entity0 , @entity1 -- in august last year , @entity4 prime minister @entity3 was not happy with @entity5			2
he complained that the @entity5 appeared to be funding an opposition candidate , @entity6 , in upcoming elections			0
what 's more , the @entity4 authorities suspected two senior @entity5 princes of involvement			0
the @entity5 launched an investigation , and uncovered something very different -- and more alarming			0
a secret report seen by @entity2 concludes : " there is no evidence any @entity5 official ever supported @entity6 " and " claims of support from the @entity5 royals named in the initial report [ names redacted ] were found to be without basis			1
" but the investigation found that hundreds of millions of dollars of @entity5 money had been funneled to leading @entity27 politicians and political activists overseas			1
it also found that @entity30 and the @entity31 were still able to use @entity5 for fund - raising , despite numerous measures to choke off those sources of cash			1
according to a @entity5 source who is not authorized to speak publically , " people close to the senior leadership of the @entity31 live in @entity5 and send money back " [ to the @entity31 ]			1
today he estimates the money reaching @entity30 is " in the region of tens of thousands of dollars possibly hundreds of thousands			1
" the nine - page summary of the secret report states that the @entity45 , an @entity27 political group present in many @entity45 countries , was trying " through its many affiliated charities and organizations -- often with the funding of unwitting private @entity5 citizens -- to spread its influence by providing support for candidates in @entity56 democracies			1
" according to the report the payback was simple			0
" once in power these candidates are expected to further the @entity45 's goals			0
" @entity30 was able to benefit from these secret funding mechanisms , according to the source , because some in the @entity45 had " historic sympathies and connections " with members of the terror group -- dating back to when @entity5 and the @entity68 covertly funded the @entity70 mujahideen to fight the @entity72 occupation of @entity70			1
the connections meant that money in @entity45 hands was " occasionally " given to @entity30 , the source said			1
the report reveals a complex web of @entity56 charities and banks -- often involved in funding legitimate humanitarian projects -- as unwitting facilitators of the illicit transfers			1
and it says that over several decades " a handful of @entity5 and other @entity87 individuals and organizations " were supporting " the same groups that @entity87 , @entity91 and @entity92 governments have long suspected of having close ties to extreme militant organizations that have been accused of supporting terrorist activities around the world			0
" the problem facing @entity5 authorities is huge , the source told @entity2			0
" eighty - six percent of all @entity56 charities are based in @entity5 " making " monitoring all their activities difficult			1
" the problem was compounded by several other factors , he said			0
@entity5 " has the world 's fourth largest migrant workforce , 7 million legal workers , 3 million illegal			0
" many of them use unregulated @entity56 @entity111 money transfer banks where a deposit in one country can immediately be picked up in another with no paper trail to trace it			2
the @entity111 networks were identified by the @entity117 last year as a significant channel for funding the @entity31 and other insurgent groups			0
funds are also collected from innocent unsuspecting pilgrims on the hajj that attracts millions of @entity124 to @entity125 , @entity56 's holiest site every year			2
the report says @entity5 has made a major effort " to block terrorist financing " that has been " monumental in scope and far reaching in their success			2
" but it concluded : " increased diligence and efforts are warranted			0
" the @entity5 source tells @entity2 that the country still has a fundamental problem which shows how money channeled through the @entity45 could evade detection for so long and why @entity30 can still get funding from the desert @entity141			1
" despite promises since 2002 that @entity5 would put in place institutions to thwart funds getting to @entity30 , nothing has happened to build an oversight agency , " he says			2
the money being funneled illegally he says is " not the amount of money it was 4 or 5 years ago , " but without a national agency " like the @entity151 " to oversee the charities further progress is going to be limited .			0
