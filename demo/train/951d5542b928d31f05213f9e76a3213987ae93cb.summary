-- @entity3 , the goalkeeper for the @entity5 national football team who killed himself on tuesday , was suffering from depression , his widow has revealed			2
@entity8 , a doctor who treated @entity3 , said the goalkeeper first sought treatment in 2003 , when he lost his starting place at @entity11 and developed anxieties and fear of failure			0
the couple 's biological daughter died three years ago from a heart problem when she was aged just two			0
dr. @entity18 , clinical director of the @entity19 at @entity20 , in @entity21 , answers some key questions about some of the issues associated with depression			1
what are the signs or symptoms that someone is suffering from this illness ? the classic symptom of depression is feeling emotionally down or blue , but when humans start feeling this way a whole bunch of other symptoms usually tag along			1
when people feel emotionally depressed they tend to lose interest in the world around them and their ability to experience pleasure withers			1
they often become very hopeless and feel overwhelmed by responsibilities that would normally be no problem for them			2
they have trouble thinking and concentrating , and when depression is severe they can feel like they are losing their minds			1
depressed people often feel very badly about themselves			1
they can be haunted by guilt and consumed by negative thoughts that run over and over again like a bad movie			0
this level of psychic misery begins to make death seem like a form of relief , so it is not surprising that most depressed people spend at least some of their time thinking about suicide			1
depressed people almost always have changes in their sleep and appetite			1
in addition , people with depression typically experience tremendous fatigue and are often plagued by aches and pains in their bodies for which no bodily cause can be found			1
what causes depression ? @entity77 is caused by an interaction between genes and environment			1
some people carry genes that make them so prone to depression that almost any degree of hardship will bump them into depression			1
at the other extreme there are environments that are so terrible that all but the most resistant people will develop depression			1
psychological stress and medical illness are the two royal roads to depression			2
almost all episodes of depression are set off by one or the other of these factors , although the more often a person is depressed the less adversity is needed to set off a new episode			1
that is one type of answer to the question of what causes depression			2
scientists are discovering a different kind of answer which has to do with the types of abnormalities in the brain and body that are characteristic of people with depression			1
we might say that depression is caused by hyperactivity of body - brain danger pathways and not enough activity in brain areas that help us get a grip on our emotions			2
in this way depression is very much a physical illness			2
what can be done to treat it ? the short answer is " many things "			0
in general , treatments boil down to either pharmacological or behavioral			0
in the pharmacological category are numerous antidepressants and other psychotropic drugs , such as lithium and atypical antipsychotics			0
in the behavioral realm are a number of psychotherapeutic techniques , ranging from psychoanalysis to behavioral therapy			0
overall , medications and therapy appear about equal in efficacy			0
recent data suggest that therapy might have a longer - lasting protective effect than medications once treatment has stopped			0
in addition to medications and therapy , recent studies suggest that vigorous exercise is also an effective treatment for depression			0
have attitudes within the medical profession changed ? no one in medicine -- in my experience -- questions either the reality or validity of major depression			0
in fact , far from disputing the importance of depression , what i usually find is a huge hunger on the part of the medical profession to learn more so they can better help their patients			0
the @entity161 now places depression as the fourth most disabling medical condition worldwide and estimates it will rise to number two by 2020			0
the days when doctors looked askance at depression as a clinical entity are long gone .			0
