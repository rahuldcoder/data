@entity0 , @entity1 -- the police investigation into the killing of @entity10 by @entity11 sounded like a catalog of bumbling , bad judgment , poor memory and petty theft in court on friday , and it was the commanding officer on the scene the night of the killing who was testifying			1
former police col. @entity18 was on the stand all day , first for the prosecution and then being cross-examined by the defense			0
he described finding a police ballistics expert handling @entity11 ' gun without wearing gloves and reprimanding the officer , who apologized and put on gloves			1
and he said he was " furious " when at least one of the @entity33 athlete 's valuable wristwatches disappeared from his bedroom as police investigated the crime scene			2
he " body searched " his fellow officers , their bags and their vehicles but was unable to find the watch , which was worth several thousand dollars			0
he also said he had ordered the bathroom door through which @entity11 shot @entity10 removed from the house , placed in a body bag and taken to his office , explaining , " the door is the most valuable evidence because the deceased was behind the door			1
" earlier in the week , the defense attacked police handling of the door , implying that the evidence was unreliable because it was contaminated			0
@entity53 resigned from the force in december after three decades , under fire for his handling of the door			0
asked what he now did for a living , he choked up and said , " i am now coaching sports , and sports is my life			0
" golden boy turned defendant he 's the 13th witness to testify for the prosecution in the murder trial of @entity11 , once @entity1 's golden boy for the stellar track success that made him the first double amputee runner to compete in the @entity33			1
the sprinter admits that he killed @entity10 , his girlfriend of about four months , on @entity72 2013 but says it was a terrible accident , not premeditated murder			2
he shot her through the locked bathroom door in his house , saying he thought she was an intruder , and then broke the door down with a cricket bat to get to her when he realized his mistake			0
@entity11 , 27 , is pleading not guilty to murder and three other weapons charges			2
on friday , his lawyer @entity84 ripped into @entity86 's chronology of events on the night of the killing , presenting witness statements from three police officers whose accounts differed from @entity18 's			2
the former officer was so startled by the statement of police sgt. @entity94 that he stared at @entity84 and said , " @entity96			0
" later , @entity84 rattled van @entity18 so severely , pointing out clear differences between two pictures that the former officer said were the same , that @entity18 refused to answer a question about how many keys were in another photograph			0
" it 's not a trick question , " @entity84 said			0
" there 's one key there			0
" gruesome images the former police colonel first took the stand thursday and said paramedics were there when he arrived at @entity11 ' address about 3:55 a.m. , but @entity10 was dead			1
as he testified , the prosecution showed more than 100 police photographs taken at @entity11 ' house after the killing , including the sprinter 's 9 mm handgun , still cocked and ready to fire , on a bloody towel or bathmat on a blood - spattered floor			1
both prosecution and defense accidentally displayed photos of @entity10 's dead body and mortal wounds thursday , prompting the man who killed her to be violently sick			1
@entity11 threw up after both defense and prosecution lawyers scrolled through evidence photos on monitors to find the ones they wanted to discuss , flashing past the gruesome images as they did so			1
there 's a monitor directly in front of @entity11 as he sits in the stand , on trial for murder			1
on friday , the court was shown a photo of a toilet covered in blood , but only @entity86 saw photos of @entity10 's body and closeups of her injuries			1
those gruesome pictures were not displayed on courtroom monitors			1
even so , @entity11 kept his head down , shielding his eyes with one hand , while prosecutor @entity155 talked the former police officer quickly through the sheaf of photos on the witness stand			1
air rifle , bat kept by bedroom door on thursday , the prosecution talked @entity18 through police photographs of the athlete 's house taken on that night			2
they showed some small spots of blood on chairs in the downstairs sitting room and a trail of blood that led upstairs			0
@entity11 appeared calm and took notes as the police photographs of the gun were shown			1
a black cell phone lay on the floor next to it			0
another image showed a bloodstained towel in the bathroom , as well as a cricket bat and bullet cartridge on the bathroom floor , next to large bloodstains			1
the photos also indicated that @entity11 kept an air rifle and baseball bat by the bedroom door			1
other police photos included one of a magazine with bullets and pouch taken from the right - hand bedside drawer and a closeup of the magazine with a hollow - point bullet , the kind that killed @entity10			1
some of the photographs appeared consistent with @entity11 ' version of events that night			2
one showed a fan by the right - hand side of the bed , which may gel with @entity11 ' account that he went out to get the fan from the balcony before hearing noises he thought were made by an intruder			0
gun at his bedside the case against @entity11 is largely circumstantial , @entity155 said in his opening statement last week			2
@entity11 and @entity10 were the only people in his house when he killed her			1
@entity155 has been building a picture of what happened through the testimony of experts , neighbors who heard screaming and bangs that night , current and former friends of @entity11 ' and a security guard who sped to the scene because of reports of gunshots			1
many prosecution witnesses ' accounts are consistent with @entity11 ' version of events : that he got up in the night , went out to his balcony to get a fan , came back inside and heard noises in the bathroom that he thought came from an intruder			1
he said he took the gun and fired while calling for @entity10 to call police			2
when she did n't answer , he realized it could have been her in the bathroom , he said			0
neighbors said they heard a woman screaming before the shots were fired			0
but the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was @entity10 screaming in fear for her life was in fact @entity11 when he realized what he had done			1
@entity11 and at least two neighbors made phone calls to security after the shooting , allowing the defense to use phone records to establish a timeline of events			2
judge @entity259 will decide the verdict			0
@entity1 does not have jury trials			0
in @entity1 , premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years			0
@entity11 also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces			2
if he is n't convicted of premeditated murder , the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide , a crime based on negligence			0
the sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge 's discretion			0
the trial is expected to take at least another week .			0
