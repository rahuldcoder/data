@entity0 , @entity1 -- under pressure to preserve the environment while at the same time ease the poverty of his people , @entity1 president @entity3 has come up with an unusual solution			1
president @entity3 has startled @entity10 with talk of not paying @entity1 's $ 10.3 billion foreign debt			1
@entity3 wants wealthy nations to pay @entity1 $ 350 million a year in exchange for leaving an estimated 1 billion barrels of oil under the ground in the pristine @entity19 rain forest			1
" i think oil has brought us more bad than good , " said @entity3 during a recent visit to the bustling @entity22 oil town of @entity0			1
" we need to do something about it			0
" environmentalists around the world have celebrated the idea , apparently the first of its kind , as a way to preserve a delicate environment without creating an economic burden for the cash - strapped nation where six in 10 people are poor			0
the move come amid growing popularity of " carbon offsetting , " in which first - world residents concerned about climate change make donations to compensate for the environmental damage their consumer habits cause			1
but critics wonder if the politically unstable @entity1 , which relies on oil for nearly half of its export revenues , can keep this promise to the international community or whether authorities are trying to have their cake and eat it , too			2
the plan involves creating a trust fund for donations or accepting debt pardons from other countries or multilateral lenders such as the @entity60			0
the $ 350 million would constitute about half the annual revenues @entity1 thinks it could make from extracting oil from the field , partly located inside the 2.4 million - acre ( 982,000 - hectare ) @entity63			1
former energy minister @entity64 has pointed out that all the oil in the @entity68 - @entity67 field would only be enough for 12 days of global crude consumption			0
government officials say @entity71 , a group of @entity74 lawmakers and even one undisclosed oil company have inquired about the plan			2
" it sounds ridiculous , but when you compare that money with @entity1 's foreign debt it 's actually a small quantity , " said @entity77 a scientist with @entity81 - based environmental coalition @entity80 's forests			2
" @entity87 nations have to chip in			0
" the @entity19 is home to species ranging from endangered white - bellied spider monkeys to rare jaguars that live alongside indigenous groups that live isolated from the outside world and still hunt with spears and blowguns			0
@entity3 , a close ally of @entity97 leftist president @entity96 , has startled @entity10 by threatening not to pay @entity1 's $ 10.3 billion foreign debt			1
he is embroiled in a power struggle with @entity99 and opposition lawmakers who say he is scaring off oil investment			0
he also openly backs a $ 6 billion lawsuit filed by indigenous groups who accuse @entity81 - based @entity106 of polluting a large swath of the @entity1 @entity22			1
the proposal 's detractors say @entity1 can not ensure the park 's sanctity given political turmoil that has at times halted oil operations and has made @entity3 the eighth president in 10 years			1
" @entity3 is asking the international community to dive in to see if there is water in the pool , " said @entity116 , an analyst with the @entity117 , a @entity118 - based think tank			0
@entity3 has said @entity1 will begin oil development next year if the government can not secure the funds by then			1
even if @entity1 can promise to halt the contamination of multinational oil behemoths , it may struggle to control an equally serious contamination threat to @entity19 -- migrants already setting up farms and shantytown dwellings there			2
but supporters of @entity3 's idea say the best way to limit the migration to the park is to ensure there are no oil - field jobs to draw them there			2
" oh @entity145 , what i would n't do to halt oil development , " said @entity140 , chief of eight rangers that watch over the park , roughly the size of @entity144			0
" i shake every time i hear about new oil development in my park			0
" e-mail to a friend			0
