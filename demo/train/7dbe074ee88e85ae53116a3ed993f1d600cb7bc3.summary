-- age has slowed @entity2 , the beloved blue hero from an earlier generation of video games , but @entity6 may have finally rehabilitated the venerable hedgehog			1
" @entity8 , " which arrives in stores tuesday for the @entity10 and @entity11 , comes at an opportune time			2
with a crucial holiday season imminent , @entity12 has n't produced a stellar @entity2 game in about a decade , and the company 's game division has performed especially sluggishly this year			1
but " @entity8 , " coming on the 20th anniversary of the franchise , looks like a promising candidate to buck these trends			1
the first batch of reviews have been positive , and the game has received more preorders than any previous @entity2 game , which is an early barometer for success			1
@entity6 also managed to build some buzz for the game at video game expos like @entity30 , although those conventions have not been particularly kind to other @entity2 games			1
encouraged by the favorable feedback , @entity6 is throwing its marketing weight behind the game			2
these initiatives include traditional advertising , constructing a @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , and a balloon in the @entity42			0
the original " @entity45 " debuted on @entity6 's @entity44 game system in 1991			2
since the heydays of @entity6 going head - to - head with @entity49 for home console domination , the company has ceased selling hardware , started @entity52 for multiple systems and merged with @entity12 , which makes pachinko slot machines in @entity56			0
perhaps as a result , @entity6 's flagship franchise , which is developed by the aptly named @entity58 , has slumped			1
@entity2 's and @entity61 's " platformer " genre -- in which cartoonish characters navigate increasingly challenging maze - like levels -- was once a blockbuster seller , but it 's been surpassed by first - person shooters such as " @entity68 " and " @entity69			0
" @entity49 has managed to maintain the high quality of @entity71 over the years , but @entity6 has struggled to remake @entity2 for the fast - paced 21st - century game industry			1
" @entity8 " is designed to " take @entity2 back to the pure elements , " @entity73 , a senior producer who led development on the @entity76 version of the game , said in an interview			1
some previous games in the series became preoccupied with elaborate story lines and slower - paced exploration			0
@entity85 and @entity86 players may have been put off by elements of the plots that were geared toward audiences in @entity56 , where @entity58 is based			0
" the team tries very hard not to bias it for a particular territory , " @entity73 said			0
" they do n't necessarily do stuff that is very , very specific to , say , their home territory			0
that 's one of the learnings that has kind of informed their development dna in the last 20 years -- that @entity2 is loved internationally			0
" for " @entity8 " and its predecessor , " @entity102 " for the @entity103 , @entity6 recruited writers from the television show " @entity106			1
" they pen straightforward scripts that they hope will resonate with players outside of @entity110 , where @entity2 's market is bigger			0
however , the writers must also adhere to standards set by @entity6 's @entity56 - based @entity113 , which is tasked with upholding the integrity of the @entity2 brand			1
" @entity2 is a beloved franchise , " @entity73 said			2
" @entity116 has @entity117 , and we have @entity2			0
" " @entity8 " is looking to polish the franchise 's legacy and reverse the recent decline of @entity2 's popularity , said @entity123 , a @entity85 - based development director for the company			1
" i think that fans recognize that as far as the quality , @entity2 is moving in the right direction			0
" the game melds the classic two - dimensional action with three - dimensional exploration			0
" we 're truly bringing the ' a game ' on ' @entity8 , ' " @entity73 said			2
" in some ways , it is sort of a celebration and a sendoff for the first generation of @entity2			0
" " @entity8 " will dip into past successes in its attempt to rebuild the franchise			2
levels from classic @entity2 games , such as the memorable @entity146 , have been remade in 3 - d. a dash of nostalgia may be just what @entity6 needs to reinvigorate its aging hedgehog .			1

@entity6 is looking to revive its flagship franchise with " @entity8 "
@entity6 has not *released* a stellar @entity2 game in about a decade
" @entity8 " celebrates the series ' 20th anniversary
