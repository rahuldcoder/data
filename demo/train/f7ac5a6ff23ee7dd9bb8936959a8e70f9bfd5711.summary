-- @entity2 's stars may have moved on from the red carpets of @entity4 , but the real " jet set " -- the @entity6 and executives who decide how , when and what we fly -- are heading back to @entity10			1
the a-listers of global aviation will be at @entity13 from june 17 to 23 for the 50th @entity14 -- the biggest and most important event in the industry 's calendar , where billion - dollar deals are done at the edge of the runway as stunt pilots swoop through the skies overhead			1
more than 2,100 companies from 44 countries around the world will fly in to showcase their wares at @entity13 ; from jumbo - sized jets and massive manufacturing tools to the tiniest springs , cogs and other components , as well as high - tech concepts which may not see the light of day for decades			1
in years gone by , the show , held at the airfield where @entity36 landed after his pioneering transatlantic flight in 1927 , has seen the debuts of some of aviation 's key developments -- from @entity42 to the @entity43 and the @entity44			1

with just days to go before the visitors arrive , it is still unclear whether the industry 's two most eagerly - awaited new planes , @entity44 ' @entity55 and @entity57 's @entity56 , will be at the show			2
both companies have warned the planes will be too busy carrying out flight tests to attend -- but industry experts say there 's an outside chance they may still be spotted in the skies above @entity66			2
" we 're still waiting to find out whether the @entity55 will put in an appearance , " said @entity67 , editor of aerospace industry magazine @entity68			0
" that certainly would be a highlight -- it 's one of the newest and most exciting aircraft , but it and @entity57 's @entity56 are at a critical point in their development			2
" it becomes a bit of a fight between the marketing people , the publicists , who want the company to get all the best headlines , and the engineers who are working to critical deadlines to get the plane ready to fly as soon as possible , " he explained			0

" with or without the @entity56 and the @entity55 , there will be plenty to look at , with flying displays , aerial acrobatics and all manner of military and commercial hardware ranged around the airfield for visitors to get up close to			0
@entity43 is flying in not one but two 787 @entity105 , and @entity44 says that visitors will still be able to explore a full - size model of the @entity55 's cockpit and cabin -- whether or not the real thing arrives			1
show organizers say one of the highlights of the show for the general public ( 204,000 of whom visited in 2011 ) is likely to be the flying demonstrations by a @entity119 @entity118 fighter jet			1
and fittingly , given that 2013 's event will be the 50th @entity14 , there will be some looking back : homegrown @entity10 plane manufacturer @entity122 will celebrate the 50th anniversary of its @entity126 business jet -- the first of which will be on display at @entity13			1

throughout the show , the conference rooms and chalets lining the runway will play host to scores of high - powered briefings and meetings ( in 2011 there were 151,000 trade visitors and 290 official delegations from around the world ) at which aerospace movers and shakers will shape the future			0
" the real reason the @entity14 exists is the industry side of things , the chance for face - to - face talks between suppliers and potential customers , the ' down - in - the - weeds ' business discussions , " he said			2
" for some manufacturers the show is all about the race for orders , how many deals they 've signed , and others make a point of avoiding that			0
but nobody really goes to @entity66 and decides there and then , ' i like that , let 's buy two , ' -- it 's the meetings that matter			0
" it 's not about past glories , it 's all about looking to the future : where the industry is going , rather than where it 's been			0
