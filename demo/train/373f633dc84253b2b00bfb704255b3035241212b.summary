-- whether you 're into lazy - day floating or rip - roaring rapids , there 's a river out there for you			1
compare these two trips to get a better idea of your taste			1
the @entity10 trip : the @entity11 , @entity12 day 1 the launch : at the tiny , woods - ensconced @entity15 , the damp air smells like a sharpened pencil			1
it makes me think of @entity20			2
for some people , that first whiff of the uncorrupted outdoors might trigger a set of survival instincts			2
but i have none of those			2
what i have are ephemeral associations with lesser - known @entity31 wine varietals			1
and so here i am , on a wine on the @entity11 tour with a winemaker , a pair of chefs , a nimble river crew and a handful of fellow fortunate souls			1
we get the necessary primer before putting in : drink lots of water , they tell us			2
always , but especially on this trip , what with the three cases of wine being loaded onto the rafts			1
" @entity50 " : that 's the answer i get when i inquire about the time			2
days here are measured in meals			1
we 've lounged away the morning on a people - free , rapids - free stretch of river in a thickly forested gorge , under a cover of damp fog -- like drifiting through a rain cloud			1
even with limited visibility , we 've seen a great blue heron , a kingfisher , @entity68 geese , an osprey , a quick glimpse of an otter and a bald eagle			2
the river is calm , and we do n't have to paddle if we do n't want to			2
yet , somehow , a stretch and a bite to eat are in order			1
the chefs have managed to pack all our food , gear and elegantly rustic table settings on the rafts , leaving the rest of us to kick back while they set up and break down each feast			2
@entity84 : mild and wild defined , plus more rafting trips wine - thirty : after several miles of floating , we pull off at the @entity89 , a woodsy gravel bar			1
for the first time in my life , i must assemble a tent alone			2
but the payoff is grand : i sit down to cumin - grilled @entity97 lamb chops with apricot - jalapeno chutney , assorted @entity12 cheeses , fruit , eggplant puree , green olive tapenade , cucumber salad and red pepper relish with wontons and flatbread ; followed by pan-seared king salmon with @entity12 wasabi - thyme aioli , lemongrass cous - cous and ginger - citrus slaw ; and finally topped off with @entity112 chocolate s'mores with homemade marshmallows -- each course paired with wine			1
it 'll go on like this for two more nights			0
@entity84 : the @entity120 's best dude ranches day 2 splashing around : i try out one of the inflatable kayaks we 've been towing			1
nobody , including me , seems to care that i can barely steer			0
it could just be hypothermia from playing in the 58º water , but i 'm feeling close to the river			0
group bonding : this evening 's icebreaker involves a spree of mutual toenail painting			0
maybe it 's the @entity137 talking , but i like these people			0
after dark , the stars go so many layers deep that a few of us decide to sleep directly under them , and our tents become mere storage units			0
day 3 campsite gourmet : at the grassy , rolling hillside of the @entity148 , we dine under an old oak tree : smoked steelhead with cream cheese , capers and onions ; roasted beets with sheep 's - milk feta ; greens with candied hazelnuts ; grilled @entity162 @entity161 - style flatiron steak with caramelized onions and housemade @entity164			1
the brussels sprouts sauteed with andouille win multiple approvals , including several from people who thought they did n't like brussels sprouts			0
day 4 the last toast : one last bracing swim and one final meal , when we compare favorite flavors : the @entity176 , the @entity177 , the @entity178 , which worked so well with that asparagus ; the crawfish cakes with remoulade , the seared duck breast , the lemon sponge cake with huckleberry compote , the everything else			0
it 's safe to say that the uncorrupted outdoors has heightened my sense of deliciousness			0
@entity84 : the @entity120 's best food towns the @entity193 trip : @entity194 , @entity195 day 1 entry : my first glimpse of the @entity198 is from 15,000 feet up in a tiny 10 - seater plane , looking down the longest raftable stretch of continuous @entity202 whitewater on the continent			1
did i mention this is my first - ever rafting trip ? beer talk : our guide @entity208 has a shaggy river - rat beard and a @entity68 lilt , and he 's as skinny and spritelike as he is ruggedly reassuring			1
he instructs the eight of us -- a motley crew of three businessmen , a doctor , a lawyer , and a ranching couple -- on what to do if we run into a bear , how to tell a grizzly from a black , and how to prevent @entity221 mishaps			0
we 're introduced to the @entity222 ( a portable toilet )			0
@entity84 : top wow spots of the @entity226 volcanoes day 2 calm water : after a paddling 101 , our three rafts head out through the riffled water that the guides -- @entity208 , @entity231 and @entity232 -- refer to as " calm			0
" which makes me and @entity236 , the other whitewater rookie , mighty nervous about the hardcore rapids to come			1
we ride 22 miles , dipping our water bottles into the 50º glacier water on the way			0
the landscape looks surprisingly like @entity242 , with pine - covered mountains and mesas -- plus moose ! we spot a chocolate - hued mother with calf and two bald eagles			1
day 3 rapids ! : here they come			1
we don our helmets , wetsuits and life jackets , and practice paddle maneuvers			0
hard forward ! we vanish into the rapids , as the raft bends and catapults and the waves pound through us on the famous great @entity260 : 12 miles of rapids in 55 minutes -- yes , that longest stretch of continuous @entity202 on the continent			1
@entity208 slides our 18 - foot - 2 - inch raft through an 18 - foot - 4 - inch gorge			1
we officially become whitewater junkies			0
at camp : tents are pitched while the guides set up and find a scenic spot for the @entity222			0
dinner is grilled chicken , fresh veggies with ginger butter , tiramisu , and five bottles of well - deserved wine			1
@entity84 : best national parks -- avoid the crowds day 4 an " easy " day : our raft gets hung up on a protuding log inside a rapid			0
ever been inside a washing machine ? on the " very cold " cycle ? @entity232 deftly extricates us , and we lay out clothes to dry on the rocks			0
we 've entered hoodoo country			0
day 5 @entity288 cakewalk : @entity288 ? no sweat			0
we talk politics as we run them			0
@entity293 goes up at @entity294 , with 200 - year - old pines and grassy meadows			1
@entity208 reads stories about spectacular @entity299 mishaps ( picture it overturning while you 're in the way )			0
@entity84 : the top 26 wilderness experiences day 6 the gaping jaws of death : hang on ! hard forward ! ! time for the 8 - foot waves of the daunting @entity308 , and i 'm paddling too intently to see past the waves			1
we just clear the foam when @entity231 yells , " @entity313 ! " and a young black bear runs up the cliff			0
after lunch , we take the two final , gargantuan rapids called @entity318 and brains smashed in			1
we high - five with our paddles , and pull up to the raft carrying the beer cooler for a toast			2
later , there 'll be @entity325 and reminiscing on a sandy beach under a red sky at our last campsite			0
