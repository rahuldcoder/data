-- in business , it 's all about location , location , location			1
even 12 - year - old @entity6 knows that			1
since 2013 , he has been manning a lemonade stand at the corner of @entity10 and @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , about 25 miles west of @entity14			1
he lives a few houses down the street from the junction , but got permission from the owners of the corner house to set up shop with his homemade sign at the higher traffic area during summer breaks and after school during the school year			2
but another neighbor on the street has been trying to put a squeeze on the kid 's sweet operation , saying @entity6 's operation is a public nuisance			1
@entity35 manager @entity34 told @entity0 that the first complaint was lodged by 61 - year - old @entity37 in 2013			1
in at least four e-mails to the city since then , @entity37 complained that @entity6 's stand caused excessive trash , traffic , noise , and affected the property value of his home , which is next door to where the stand is set up			1
" if this were a once a year event by a couple kids to earn a little money for a holiday or something , i would not have a problem with it , " @entity37 wrote			2
" i am very worried about the value of my home , which is why i built in a residential area , not a business area			0
" a community police officer has been sent out at least twice to survey the claims , and found it to be a non-issue after polling neighbors			2
" we respect his right to have an opinion and took it seriously enough to do an investigation , " said @entity34 , who added that there has only been one person who has submitted complaints			2
this summer , when another complaint rolled in , @entity71 once again inquired into the complaint			0
" same results , same investigation , " @entity34 said			0
since @entity37 's stand against the stand gained local and national attention , the city of about 37,000 has rallied behind the budding entrepreneur , including local radio personality @entity81 of 102.5 @entity82			1
on monday , the station surprised @entity6 and sent an employee to work the lemonade stand until he got home from school			1
it also urged listeners to pay the boy a visit			0
" this is amazing , i definitely did not know they were doing this , and i just got a call from a friend saying they were , so i just ran over here and it 's amazing , " @entity6 told @entity0 affiliate @entity92			0
the stand made an estimated $ 600 in two hours , according to @entity92			0
" i think it 's really good when young people get a chance to learn what it 's like to earn some money for themselves , " said mayor @entity100 , who happens to live right around the corner from @entity6			0
neighbors like him do n't want to vilify @entity37 for complaining			0
" sometimes you just have to step back and get a little perspective , " @entity100 said .			0
