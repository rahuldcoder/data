-- this weekend , the @entity1 proved that cave people have more pop culture appeal than just @entity5 commercials			1
the $ 135 million film , which features vocal performances by @entity8 , @entity9 , and @entity10 , bashed up a strong $ 44.7 million in its first three days — the second best debut of 2013 behind @entity13 's $ 79.1 million bow			1
the colorful family film was produced by @entity15 , whose last film , @entity16 , severely underperformed and forced the company to take an $ 87 million write - down			2
thus , the @entity1 ' success ( for reference , rise opened with just $ 23.7 million on its way to a $ 103.2 million domestic finish ) is vindicating for the @entity25 - owned studio			1
for distributor @entity26 , who inked a five - year distribution deal with @entity15 last year , the @entity1 is poised to become a massive success			1
the film opened in the same range as 2012 ′ s @entity32 : @entity33 ( $ 46.7 million ) and higher than the studio 's 2011 release , @entity36 , which began its flight with $ 39.2 million			2
with an " a " @entity38 and @entity40 / @entity39 ahead for many young school - goers — plus the fact that there are literally no family or animated films hitting theaters until @entity47 on may 24 — the @entity1 could evolve into a box office mammoth			1
a $ 200 million domestic finish would n't surprise me one bit			2
internationally , the @entity1 proved equally appealing , bowing with $ 63.3 million for a sizzling $ 108 million global total after its first three days			1
in second , @entity55 's @entity54 thriller @entity53 scored an impressive $ 30.5 million from 3,098 theaters , making its debut the best action start of 2013 — ahead of @entity60 , which took in only $ 24.8 million in its first weekend			1
@entity62 , which stars @entity63 , @entity64 , and @entity65 , cost @entity66 $ 70 million to produce , but with an " a- " @entity38 , the presidential thriller may enjoy better - than - expected legs			2
interestingly , @entity62 is n't the only @entity54 action movie hitting theaters in 2013			0
@entity75 's @entity74 / @entity73 vehicle @entity72 is currently slated for a june 28 release			0
@entity62 arrives on the heels of numerous older - male - targeting action flops like @entity79 , @entity80 , and @entity81 , which makes its success all the more impressive			2
@entity55 did manage to reach men , who made up 53 percent of the opening weekend audience , with television ads on @entity86 , @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity93 tournament coverage , and @entity26 's sunday animation block , but it 's also telling that women comprised 47 percent of the audience			0
according to exit polling , crowds were 73 percent above the age of 25			0
the film also marks a return - to - form for leading man @entity102 , whose last three wide releases , chasing @entity105 ( $ 6 million total ) , @entity107 ( $ 13.1 million ) , and @entity108 ( $ 8.8 million ) , have all badly flopped			2
@entity53 's strong opening weekend is @entity63 's career second - best behind his breakout 300 , which bowed with $ 70.9 million in 2007			1
down two spots to third place , @entity116 's $ 215 million @entity115 - directed adventure @entity13 fell 47 percent to $ 22 million in its third weekend , lifting its total to $ 177.6 million overall			2
worldwide , the film has earned $ 356.4 million , though international receipts ( $ 178.8 million ) have n't been as robust as most were expecting			2
@entity122 's schlocky thriller @entity123 dropped 49 percent in its second weekend to $ 8.7 million , giving it a respectable $ 30.9 million ten - day total			0
the $ 13 million production , distributed by @entity75 's division @entity126 , has now earned more than the last film starring @entity128 in a leading role , @entity130 , which tanked with only $ 27.8 million against a $ 100 million budget			0
rounding out the @entity132 was the @entity135 / @entity134 comedy admission , which only earned $ 6.4 million from 2,160 theaters in its first weekend			1
audiences rejected the @entity140 film , which fortunately cost just $ 13 million to produce			0
admission marks the first real bomb for @entity135 , who previously found success with @entity144 ( $ 86.1 million ) , @entity145 ( $ 60.5 million ) , and @entity146 ( $ 98.7 million ) — all sharper , edgier comedies than this			1
for @entity134 , on the other hand , @entity141 is the fourth bomb out of his five last releases			0
though the actor 's previous film , this is 40 , quietly blossomed into a mid-level hit at the holiday box office with $ 67.5 million , his other recent efforts all began in the same sad range as admission			1
2010 @entity160 ( $ 7.5 million debut , $ 30.2 million finish ) , 2011 ′ s @entity163 ( $ 7 million debut , $ 24.8 million finsh ) , and 2012 ′ s @entity166 ( $ 6.5 million debut , $ 17.5 million finish ) each hurt his box office credibility			0
@entity134 tends to fare better in dude - movies like @entity171 , @entity172 , which each earned about $ 70 million domestically			1
the @entity1 -- $ 44.6 million 2			1
@entity53 -- $ 30.5 million 3			1
@entity13 -- $ 22 million 4			0
@entity123 -- $ 8.7 million 5			0
admission -- $ 6.4 million 6			1
@entity174 -- $ 5 million in sixth place , the @entity116 - girls - gone - bad film @entity174 found $ 5 million from 1,102 theaters			1
the @entity180 release has garnered massive publicity thanks to the allure of seeing onetime @entity116 starlets like @entity184 and @entity185 ( who , granted , did n't have a squeaky clean reputation ) traipsing about in bikinis while wielding guns , but the deeply strange r - rated art piece , which also stars @entity191 , confounded many young moviegoers this weekend , and word - of - mouth is destined to squash @entity174 ' hopes of mainstream success			0
still , the film cost only $ 2 million to produce , and it should ultimately become a profitable venture for the fledgling studio			0
way , way further down the chart , @entity203 's latest , @entity200 , which was directed by @entity201 shiller @entity201 , had one of the worst debuts of the year			0
