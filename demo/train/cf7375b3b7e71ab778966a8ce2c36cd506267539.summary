in a 2011 conversation about the @entity1 , @entity3 economist @entity2 , one of the architects of the law more commonly known as @entity1 , talked about how the bill would get rid of all tax credits for employer - based health insurance through " mislabeling " what the tax is and who it would hit			1
in recent days , the past comments of @entity2 -- who in a 2010 speech noted that he " helped write the federal bill " and " was a paid consultant to the @entity21 administration to help develop the technical details as well " -- have been given renewed attention			1
in previously posted but only recently noticed speeches , @entity2 discusses how those pushing the bill took part in an " exploitation of the lack of economic understanding of the @entity31 voter , " taking advantage of voters ' " stupidity " to create a law that would ultimately be good for them			1
the issue at hand in this sixth video is known as the " @entity40 tax , " which was represented as a tax on employers ' expensive health insurance plans			0
while employers do not currently have to pay taxes on health insurance plans they provide employees , starting in 2018 , companies that provide health insurance that costs more than $ 10,200 for an individual or $ 27,500 for a family will have to pay a 40 percent tax			0
" economists have called for 40 years to get rid of the regressive , inefficient and expensive tax subsidy provided for employer provider health insurance , " @entity2 said at the @entity53 for public policy research in @entity55			1
the subsidy is " terrible policy , " @entity2 said			1
" it turns out politically it 's really hard to get rid of , " @entity2 said			1
" and the only way we could get rid of it was first by mislabeling it , calling it a tax on insurance plans rather than a tax on people when we all know it 's a tax on people who hold those insurance plans			2
" ( the @entity76 press secretary said at a press briefing in 2010 : " i would disagree with your notion that it is a tax on an individual since the proposal is written as a tax on an insurance company that offers a plan			0
" ) the second way was have the tax kick in " late , starting in 2018			0
but by starting it late , we were able to tie the cap for @entity40 to @entity89 , not medical inflation , " @entity2 said			2
@entity89 is the consumer price index , which is lower than medical inflation			0
@entity2 explains that by drafting the bill this way , they were able to pass something that would initially only impact some employer plans though it would eventually hit almost every employer plan			1
and by that time , those who object to the tax will be obligated to figure out how to come up with the money that repealing the tax will take from the treasury , or risk significantly adding to the national debt			0
" what that means is the tax that starts out hitting only 8 % of the insurance plans essentially amounts over the next 20 years essentially getting rid of the exclusion for employer sponsored plans , " @entity2 said			2
" this was the only political way we were ever going to take on one of the worst public policies in @entity31			0
" unions and employers who object in 2018 , he noted , " at that point if they want to get rid of it they 're going to have to fill a trillion dollar hole in the deficit ... it 's on the books now			2
" ( when the @entity40 tax was first rolled out , it was explained by @entity1 backers as a tax that would only impact those with " high end plans " -- not all employer sponsored plans			2
a @entity76 economic adviser in 2009 set " the record straight " by saying " the excise tax levied on insurance companies for high - premium plans , the so - called ' cadillac tax , ' will affect only a small portion of the very highest cost health plans -- a total of 3 % of premiums in 2013			0
" ) @entity2 's are at about the 30:38 mark here			1
former @entity76 press secretary @entity145 told @entity146 that @entity2 's remarks in general were " very harmful politically to the president			1
" @entity2 " speaks from the @entity151 with remarkable hubris about the @entity31 voter and by extension the @entity155 , " @entity145 told the lead with @entity150			2
" any health care reform that sought to control costs and expand insurance would involve winners and losers			0
and that 's always going to be the case			0
" many of the videos were discovered by a @entity166 - area financial adviser named @entity167 who has spent the last year researching @entity1 after his family insurance premiums doubled			1
@entity167 told @entity146 that he had assumed , incorrectly , that since he liked his health insurance plan and he had insurance , he would n't be much impacted by the new law .			0

@entity3 economist @entity2 is considered the architect of @entity1
videos where @entity2 insults voters and explains the law have recently emerged
*opponents* of @entity1 see this as *evidence* of the law 's ill will
