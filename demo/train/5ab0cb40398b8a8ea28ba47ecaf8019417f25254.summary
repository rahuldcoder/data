-- @entity1 ended @entity3 's eight - year stay in the @entity4 with a ruthless 4 - 1 victory at the @entity6 to keep their @entity8 dreams alive and relegate the @entity10 winners			1
the result had numerous repercussions but @entity1 coach @entity13 will concentrate on the fact that his side can secure a 16th successive season of @entity8 football by taking three points at @entity19 on sunday			1
goals from @entity21 ( 2 ) , @entity22 and @entity23 moved the @entity24 up to fourth in the @entity4 with 70 points , crucially one more than @entity27 rivals @entity26 with one game of the season left			2
" we 've got another big game on sunday and we 'll give it all again , " @entity30 , whose side trailed @entity26 by eight points in february , told @entity33			0
" it is sad ( @entity3 ) go down because they play good football with intelligent players			2
" the defeat that sent @entity3 back to the second tier championship came just three days after @entity42 's side won the @entity10 , stunning @entity43 with a 1 - 0 victory at @entity45			1
in the long history of @entity48 football , @entity3 become the first side to be relegated in the same season as winning the @entity10 , a tournament that was first contested in 1871			1
nonetheless , the @entity45 win means @entity3 garnered more silverware during their eight years in the @entity4 than rivals @entity1 , whose last trophy came when winning the @entity10 at the end of the 2004 - 2005 season			1
" i never expected this to happen , " said @entity42 , whose side briefly rallied when @entity57 made it 1 - 1 on the stroke of half - time			0
" the group of players we have at the club are an incredible bunch , and we did n't deserve this			2
i am glad they showed what they were capable of -- winning the @entity10 was an incredible achievement -- but this is a tough day for the club			1
" despite the disappointment , @entity42 -- who has been heavily linked with taking the vacant @entity74 job in recent days -- preferred to focus on the positives of his side 's top flight adventure			0
" we had an incredible eight years in the @entity4 and we need to build for the future , " the @entity79 added			0
" it 's great to win the @entity10			1
it 's an achievement that will live forever			0
the relegation is something we can rectify			0
" the club is on a fantastic financial footing			2
we are stronger than ever			0
it 's important we make our fans really proud			0
they supported us like they always do			0
" it 's a difficult time			0
it 's a time to look forward to the future			0
" as the @entity97 joined @entity98 and @entity99 , who lost 2 - 0 at home to @entity43 on tuesday , in the @entity102 , fans of @entity95 and @entity96 all breathed a huge sigh of relief as their @entity4 survival was ensured			2
during their spell in the @entity4 , @entity3 often flirted with relegation -- twice surviving on the final day -- but the 2012 - 2013 season proved a step too far			1
one of the @entity45 heroes , goalkeeper @entity111 , was in tears at the final whistle			0
@entity99 were another team departing the @entity4 and they ended their home campaign with their 21st defeat of the season , as visiting @entity43 fans thanked @entity119 for his tenure at the club			1
the @entity122 was dismissed on monday despite delivering @entity43 's first major trophies in over three decades , with assistant coach @entity124 taking charge of the team at short notice			2
goals in each half from @entity130 and @entity131 saw @entity43 finish the season in second place , with the victory ensuring that wednesday 's @entity135 finalists @entity136 could no longer catch them			1
with @entity140 @entity139 strongly tipped to take charge of @entity43 , the club 's supporters unfurled banners and sang songs in praise of @entity119 -- who delivered the @entity146 and 2012 @entity4 title during his spell in charge .			1

@entity1 maintain @entity8 bid with victory that relegates @entity3
@entity3 become first club to win @entity10 and be relegated in same season
*managerless* @entity43 begin life without @entity119 with a win
