-- former @entity2 assistant @entity1 believes the @entity4 club will re-appoint @entity5 as their new manager			1
@entity1 worked alongside @entity5 in 2009 , when the @entity7 took over from @entity8 , and the pair helped @entity2 lift the @entity10 that season			1
@entity5 's temporary reign ended before the start of the 2009 - 2010 season and @entity15 then took the @entity17 side to a league and cup double , before a trophy-less season just gone resulted in the @entity21 losing his job			2
since then , @entity5 -- who is currently in charge of the @entity25 national side -- has been linked with a return to @entity27 and @entity1 , who was controversially sacked by @entity2 last season			1
believes he will be appointed by the @entity17 club very soon			0
speaking to @entity0 , @entity1 said : " it seems to be heading towards @entity5			1
he has been there once before , only for four months , but we won the @entity10 and also reached the @entity35 semifinals in that time			0
" the @entity35 seems to be the holy grail for @entity2 and if they are to go one stage further in that competition , @entity5 would be the man to do that			1
" @entity1 added : " @entity5 knows the way @entity2 think and knows everybody at the training ground , so it would just be like slotting in the last piece of the jigsaw puzzle			1
" meanwhile , @entity46 have confirmed the appointment of former @entity49 manager @entity48 on a three - year contract			1
@entity48 led @entity49 to victory in last season 's @entity53 final , but the club were also relegated out of the @entity4 for the second time under his control -- and he quit his position under a cloud last week			0
@entity49 and @entity46 are bitter city rivals and @entity48 's appointment has resulted in fan demonstrations			2
however , @entity48 told the official @entity46 website : " i know some of the fans have voiced concerns and i can understand why			2
but it is up to me to convince them that i am the right man to take this club forward			0
" elsewhere in the @entity4 , the fixtures for the forthcoming 2011 - 2012 season were released with champions @entity71 facing a trip to @entity73 in their opening match			0
@entity71 won 2 - 1 there last season , but @entity73 were the only team to come away from @entity77 with a point in a 2 - 2 draw			0
@entity81 travel to @entity82 , where they squandered a four - goal lead to draw 4 - 4 , while new big - money @entity85 signing @entity87 faces a dream home debut against the club he has just left , @entity89			0
new boys @entity90 face a daunting trip to @entity93 , while fellow - newcomers @entity94 are at home to @entity97 and @entity98 must travel to @entity99 .			0

@entity1 believes @entity5 will be re-appointed as @entity2 manager
@entity1 tells @entity0 that @entity5 will be the *perfect* manager to return to the club
@entity48 is named new manager of @entity46 on a three - year contract
