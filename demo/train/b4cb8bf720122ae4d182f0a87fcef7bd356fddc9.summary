mr @entity6 resigned as @entity7 's chairman on monday night , saying it had been transformed from " a world leader in the aluminium industry into a company overburdened by debt and involved in a huge number of legal battles and social conflicts "			1
@entity20 , @entity7 's controlling shareholder and chief executive , hit back at mr @entity6 on tuesday			1
" there is no crisis , either deep or shallow			0
there is a difficult situation on the market which determines the economic results , " he said , adding that @entity7 would replace him with an independent chairman			0

a spokesman for mr @entity6 declined to comment on @entity7 's accusation			1
@entity7 's shares were down over 3 per cent as trading resumed wednesday morning in @entity32			2

the stock is now 43 per cent below its @entity56 price			0
@entity7 's ipo was controversial in the @entity58 territory because of corporate governance concerns , and regulators initially restricted its sale to retail investors			1
