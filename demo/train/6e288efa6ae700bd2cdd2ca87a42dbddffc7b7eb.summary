@entity1 , @entity0 -- when @entity5 appeared on the @entity7 roundtable last year , his company @entity3 was best known for cranking out wind - up radios you could , well , crank up			1
last year , former principal voice @entity5 and his wife @entity10 were named @entity11 ' @entity12			1
' @entity13 was the main beneficiary of its best - known product , the @entity16			1
this year , the emphasis is on @entity18 , where , like @entity13 , millions of rural poor live without access to electricity			1
" when you 've got one billion people and that kind of energy poverty it 's almost a perfect storm for us , " @entity5 says			1
@entity3 started manufacturing its first products in @entity18 in february			1
so far , around 6000 " @entity33 ' lights " and " farmers ' torches " have been distributed in @entity29 , @entity30 and @entity31			0
by the end of the year , it hopes to be supplying lights , radios and other products to the rest of the country			0
entering @entity18 for @entity3 , the move into @entity18 has been a long time coming			1
it took years of research			0
eventually the decision hinged on finding a " first - rate " partner			0
@entity5 says he found just that in @entity49 , former chairman of the @entity51			1
one of @entity18 's oldest industrial houses , the group was founded by @entity55 's great - grandfather in 1905			1
" in my mind this is the business of the future , especially for @entity18 , " @entity56 says			2
" there are 600,000 villages , out of which 40,000 will never get electricity in our lifetime			2
the cost of transition is very high , it 's prohibitive			2
" in the poorest villages , families use kerosene to power traditional @entity72 lamps			2
fire is n't the only risk			0
kerosene is known to cause health problems , and its cost can be excessive for local people			0
while the official rate for one liter of kerosene is 11.5 rupees , or 28 cents , on the black market it can sell for as much as 90 rupees , or more than two dollars			0
the lantern costs a lot more -- around 800 rupees -- but @entity86 hopes it will replace the two to three liters of kerosene used by each family every month			0
by that measure , after 13 months , the power created by the " @entity90 " would effectively be free			0

" it 's an extremely well known program now and to be a part of it implies a certain gravitas , " he adds			0
" ultimately the recognition of the whole issue of energy poverty has helped to push it into the world scene			0
" at last year 's @entity99 , @entity5 asked : " how can we enable access to self - sufficient energy by those who need it the most yet can afford it the least ? " with the help of local partners in @entity13 , and now @entity18 , he 's going some way to finding the answer .			1
