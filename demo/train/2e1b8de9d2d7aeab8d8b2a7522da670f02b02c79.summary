@entity0 -- human error and system lapses , rather than deliberate concealing of information , allowed a terror suspect with explosives to board a @entity12 - bound airplane on christmas day , president @entity3 's terrorism czar said sunday			1
@entity13 , the assistant to the president for homeland security and counterterrorism , said on @entity1 's " @entity17 " that the security breakdown in the failed bombing of the @entity21 flight was different from the september 11 , 2001 , terror attacks			1
" it 's not like 9/11 , " @entity13 said , adding that the " system did n't work as it should have " due to " lapses " and " human error			1
" " there was n't an effort to try to conceal information , " he said , referring to the well - chronicled competition and turf wars among security agencies prior to the 2001 attacks , which was later blamed for the failure to prevent them			2
" there is no smoking gun piece of intelligence out there , " @entity13 said of the failed @entity35 bombing , allegedly planned by a @entity37 man who boarded the flight from @entity39 , @entity40 , to @entity41 , @entity42 , with explosives in his underwear			2
meanwhile , the @entity49 announced sunday new security measures to be implemented by domestic and international air carriers on flights bound for the @entity12 , effective monday			0
the suspect 's father , a leading banker in @entity37 , warned @entity12 authorities before the attack that his son might be involved with @entity59 extremists			1
@entity13 said the father 's information was part of " bits and pieces " of information that were never connected by intelligence officials to properly target the suspect			1
" that was certainly an alert that came to our attention , " @entity13 said of the father 's warnings			1
" he said , ' he 's consorting with extremists in @entity75			0
' " however , @entity13 rejected another potential warning sign -- that the suspect purchased the airline ticket with cash in @entity80 before traveling to @entity37 for the first leg of his journey			1
" a lot of people buy their tickets in @entity86 with cash			0
that is the way , in fact , things are done , because there 's so much fraud there			0
so that was n't a necessary [ warning ] bell , " @entity13 said			1
" people in the @entity39 airport did n't even know that he had bought the ticket for cash			1
he did bring on carry - on luggage			0
so there were a lot of things that were out there			0
" at the same time , @entity13 conceded " there was information that was in the system that should have allowed us to stop it			2
" " a number of pieces were out there that were n't brought together , " @entity13 said			2
on the same program , however , the @entity115 chairman of the 9/11 commission said @entity13 was " wrong when he says this was n't like 9/11			1
" @entity120 , a former governor of @entity121 , said both events occurred because the @entity12 intelligence community failed to piece together various bits of information it already possessed in the weeks and months prior to the attacks			2
if the information had been properly shared and analyzed , " then this guy would 've never have gotten on a plane " on christmas day , @entity120 said			0
in announcing the new security measures sunday , the @entity49 stressed in a statement that " effective aviation security must begin beyond our borders			0
" as a result , any individual flying into the @entity12 who is " traveling from or through nations that are state sponsors of terrorism or other countries of interest will be required to go through enhanced screening , " the statement said			0
" the directive also increases the use of enhanced screening technologies and mandates threat - based and random screening for passengers on @entity12 bound international flights			0

@entity13 : " system did n't work as it should have " due to " lapses " and " human error "
suspect 's cash *payment* for *airfare* " was n't a necessary [ warning ] bell , " says @entity13
@entity120 of 9/11 panel says @entity13 " wrong when he says this was n't like 9/11 "
