-- @entity2 " @entity1 considers himself a " truther			1
" the 37 - year - old rapper , producer and one - half of the legendary hip hop group @entity7 said his grandmother once told him his position as a public figure was to bring valuable information to his audience and community			1
" there 's facts right there in your face , " @entity1 said			2
" they 've got a cure for cancer , they 've got a cure for @entity24 , cure for everything , but they make so much money off the medicine you 'll never see it			0
the people have to understand that			0
" @entity0 @entity31 : @entity1 on @entity1 talking about life according to @entity1 the average person is living an illusion and accepting false information			2
hence the name of his latest solo album ( he counts it as his third , calling " @entity39 " his actual first album ) , " @entity41 , " which he has called an overall " search for truth			1
" released via @entity44 , " @entity49 " is a follow - up to @entity1 's 2010 release , " sir @entity47 : the @entity57 , " and comes from a title his grandmother had for her ( planned ? ) autobiography in which she would air the family 's dirty laundry			2
@entity1 's latest musical effort is his way of exposing himself and the world around him			1
" i 'm talking about life , " he said of the 14 - track disc ( 17 if you nabbed the deluxe version )			0
" some people do n't get that because they 're so numb to what the mainstream media is pumping into their head with these reality shows and a certain type of song that 's played 1,000 times on the radio every day and i refuse to do that			0
" so what did he do ? if you were to ask the music critics , @entity1 just released his most complete work to date and the closest fans will get ( for now ) to an @entity7 album in terms of it 's boldness in sound and creative risks			1
but before @entity1 could ever move forward carving out his legacy , he had to shake an old stigma from his past			2
' the player and the poet ' shortly after the success of their first hit single , " @entity95 " in 1993 , @entity1 and his partner - in - rhyme @entity92 were dubbed " the player and the poet , " with @entity1 playing the role of the former			1
through marketing and promotion , @entity1 was cast as the bad boy , while @entity92 was the thoughtful , creative one			1
@entity1 maintains that he has never liked the moniker			2
" everybody thought i was just a @entity104			0
i 'm just selling dope and getting laid all day , " he said			0
" i think when they put that title on it people kind of took it and ran with it			0
" @entity7 went on to sell more than 20 million records , earning multiple @entity111 , including album of the year in 2004 , and the group has since been hailed as creative geniuses and one of the greatest hip - hop groups of all time			1
search for truth while " @entity49 " has a lot of @entity122 - style funk and features indie rockers @entity125 and @entity126 , it also carries the political punch of @entity128 , with songs like " @entity130 , " which some might say borders on conspiracy theory			2
one of the track 's opening lines is : " i wish they could send me to the moon and back with a cure for cancer and save the lives of my great grandmomma and great granddaddy now that 's the answer to the question / but they make money off the medicine leaving us all stuck in elections with no progressions just recessions			0
" and so back to that whole " truther " thing , which @entity1 said is just his taking the time to find information and share it with anyone who will listen			2
he is also quick to strike down the conspiracy theorist label			0
" i mean its drone strikes , @entity159 killing kids overseas every day , they 're not telling you about that , " he said			0
" why not ? are our kids ' lives more valuable than the ones ' overseas ? a child is a child			0
there 's no conspiracy in this			0
" best friends another theory @entity1 finds himself dealing with is the status of @entity7 and his relationship with @entity92			1
there was the whole @entity178 " diss " and the apology @entity92 made to @entity1 via @entity180 's " i 'm sorry			1
" or could it just be the fact that since , really , 2000 's " @entity185 , " the duo has more or less not made an album together ? if you listen carefully , @entity1 addresses the matter on " @entity49 , " but he does n't hold back if asked about it , either			1
" people do n't know or they do n't catch all of the interviews and then ( there 's ) all the sensational headlines , but you 've got to really understand that me and @entity92 have a relationship that 's bigger than music , " he said			2
" we 're best friends			0
music just came along because it 's what we 're put here to do and what @entity199 brought us together to do			0
but that 's my brother ; you know what i 'm saying ? there 's no beef , no nothing			0
" in fact , not one song made it to the final cut of " @entity49 " without a listen from @entity92 , @entity1 said			1
verbal exercises fans and the @entity213 were abuzz when word got out @entity1 and @entity92 would be " reuniting " for @entity217 's " @entity216 , " and @entity180 's i 'm sorry , " both tracks that already featured @entity92			1
in a text message , @entity1 responded to the idea of these songs being @entity7 reunions			1
" they are n't , " he wrote			0
" i 'm just verbally exercising			0
" to the folks calling for a new @entity7 album , @entity226 's answer is , well , honest			1
" if we did records like what i 'm doing right now , if i go so deep y'all will never get an @entity7 album , " he said			1
" we ai n't excited about doing an @entity7 album because people ai n't going to understand it			2
