@entity1 football fans have been warned they face criminal prosecution if they continue to chant a word which has been deemed anti-semitic			1
the @entity4 ( @entity4 ) have told fans to stop using the word " @entity11 " , a term which at different times throughout history has been used by @entity10 and also to abuse them			1
@entity12 , a @entity13 - based club , are known for having a large number of @entity10 supporters			1
a section of @entity12 fans have attempting to reclaim the " @entity22 " by referring to themselves as the " @entity19 " and chanting it at matches			1
but the @entity4 has warned that such practices are no longer acceptable as it continues its fight against discrimination in the @entity1 game			1
" we are committed to tackling discrimination in all its forms and that includes anti-semitic behavior in football , " @entity4 general secretary @entity27 said in a statement			1
" the y - word has no place in our game and its use in stadiums can result in a football banning order			2
we are determined that everyone can enjoy football in a fan friendly and safe environment			2
" the @entity4 also stated that , while it understands the motives of fans attempting to reclaim an offensive term , it still deems the word a discriminatory slur			1
" the @entity4 appreciates that language is a complex issue : the use and meaning of words is constantly evolving , " read a statement			2
" this means that , over time , sometimes neutral words or phrases can come to be understood as offensive ; and , similarly , words or phrases previously considered as offensive can become more acceptable			2
" although the term derives from the @entity67 word for a jew , its use in the @entity1 language has been , both historically and in contemporary use , derogatory and offensive			1
" it is noted that many minority communities have sought to reclaim historic terms of abuse such as this as a means of empowerment			0
the process of empowerment through reclaiming language is complex and can often divide opinion within the same community			0
" in light of the historic and contemporary use of the term , the @entity4 considers that the use of the term ' @entity11 ' is likely to be considered offensive by the reasonable observer			1
" speaking on behalf of @entity91 , a @entity92 charity aimed at promoting @entity10 participation in sports , @entity90 declared the word does not have a place in modern language due to its associations with fascist views of @entity100 , a politician during the early decades of the 20th century			1
" the y - word causes offense to many people , @entity10 and @entity104 , however it is intended , " said @entity90			1
" its historic association with @entity100 's fascists and continued use by antisemites outside football mean that it has no place in football grounds or anywhere else			0
" @entity114 , chief executive of the @entity115 in @entity13 , says he has no problem with fellow @entity12 fans using the word , although he can not bring himself to say it out loud			1
he told @entity120 : " i 've had that word spat at me in the street , had the word scrawled over my exercise book at school and been held up by the scruff of my neck and had that word shouted at me			0
" that word has a lot of meaning for me and it 's the reason i ca n't say the word			0
" the problems with words which have racist connotations is that it 's about context			0
" when i go to football matches and i have to listen to fans , a minority mind you , hissing to make the sounds of the gas chambers , i do n't believe anybody can tell me the reason they do it is because some @entity12 fans are singing a song about @entity149 which rhymes with the '' y " word			1
" @entity12 explained how the uses of the term by their fans was a " defense mechanism " rather than a deliberate attempt to insult the @entity10 community			1
" last season saw a number of incidents where fans were targeted by allegedly far - right activists on the continent and subjected to anti-semitic abuse by opposition fans , " said a club spokesman			2
" subsequently , the debate on this issue has two key considerations			0
" firstly , whether or not its use now plays a role in deflecting or attracting unjustified abuse , abuse that is inexcusable on any grounds ; and secondly , whether it is liable to cause offense to others even if unintentionally			0
our fans have themselves engaged in this debate following the events of last season			0
" we recognize that this is a complex debate and that , in the interests of encouraging a positive and safe environment for all supporters , consideration should be given to the appropriateness and suitability of its continued use			0
" we are already in the process of engaging with our fans and shall be consulting more widely in due course			0
" but @entity191 , chairman of the @entity192 , believes @entity12 supporters must take more responsibility in tackling the issue			2
" we 're not blaming @entity12 fans , " he told @entity120			2
" but they have to take responsibility			0
those same fans would not dare use that word on a saturday afternoon outside the ground			2
you can not have an area of @entity13 which is ring fenced for racism or anti-semitism			0
" in recent years , the @entity4 has shown its sensitivity to the concerns of the @entity1 football 's jewish community			1
the @entity212 national team paid a visit to the @entity215 concentration camp @entity216 in @entity217 ahead of the @entity219 tournament in @entity220 and @entity221 last year			0
in october , @entity212 manager @entity222 will open the " four four jew " exhibition at the @entity225			0
the exhibition celebrates the jewish community 's contribution to @entity92 football .			0

@entity1 football fans could face criminal charges for using an offensive term
the @entity4 is warned fans not to use the term " *yid* "
the word has been used by @entity10 and to insult them throughout history
@entity241 club @entity12 has a large @entity10 fan base
