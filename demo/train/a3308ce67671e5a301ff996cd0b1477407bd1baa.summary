-- there may be a little bit of panic that sets in as you approach a toll booth and you realize you do n't have any money on you			0
but apparently not for some people in @entity8			2
take , for instance , a man and woman from @entity12			0
according to the @entity15 , their vehicle has passed a toll booth without someone paying more than 14,000 times			1
make that 14,358 , to be exact			0
and the state really , really wants them to pay their bill -- $ 236,026.32 -- for the unpaid tolls and fines ( the fines always get you )			0
@entity8 gave the duo and other toll scofflaws until wednesday to pay up or else			1
the else turns out to be the state publicly releasing the names of the people it says are the top 25 violators			1
congratulations , @entity35 ! all 25 are from your area			1
sixteen drivers owe more than $ 100,000 , the state says all told it is owed $ 27 million from across the state -- at least 28,000 drivers owe more than $ 100 in unpaid tolls			0
there is good news ; @entity8 is willing to negotiate a settlement or give violators the option of a payment plan			1
@entity0 affiliate @entity49 reported officials said they have already sent letters and made phone calls to people in advance of wednesday 's deadline			0
by the way , if you were wondering , if someone drove twice each day on a toll road without paying , it would take 19Â½ years to amass 14,000 violations			2
@entity8 also says if violators are pulled over for a traffic violation , they can have their cars impounded .			2

one vehicle has used @entity8 toll roads 14,000 times without paying
@entity8 now publishes the names of the top violators
all of the top scofflaws are from the @entity35 area
at least a payment plan is available
