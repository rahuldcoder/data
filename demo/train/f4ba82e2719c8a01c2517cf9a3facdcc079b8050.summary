-- a 10 - month - old @entity4 boy born with a fatal genetic disorder died sunday at a @entity7 hospital where he had gone in hope of receiving a potentially life - saving organ transplant , his parents said in a @entity11 post			1
@entity14 , after having open heart surgery when he was about 2 1/2 weeks old , was diagnosed with complete @entity16 syndrome , a rare disease that left him with no immune system			1
however , it was not @entity14 's heart or the complete @entity16 syndrome that ultimately caused his death , his mother said in the same @entity11 post			1
@entity14 died from complications resulting from a problem with his airway			2
@entity14 went to @entity28 to receive a thymus transplant			1
the procedure was pioneered by @entity28 's dr. m. @entity31 , the only doctor at the only hospital in the @entity33 that performs the surgery			2
@entity14 's condition resulted from the absence of a thymus gland , which produces t cells , a type of white blood cell that helps protect the body from infection , @entity31 told @entity43 in a television interview in december			2
without t cells , @entity14 had no way to fight infections , @entity31 explained			0
sixty infants with complete @entity16 syndrome have received transplants and 43 , or 72 % , survived , according to @entity28			0
but @entity14 's family hit a roadblock when coverage for the transplant was denied by @entity55 , an @entity56 administrator that was their insurer , because the surgery was considered experimental			1
the cost of the surgery was an estimated $ 500,000 , which @entity14 's parents told @entity0 they could not afford			1
@entity14 's plight became the focus of many media reports			1
@entity55 eventually reversed its decision and agreed to cover the transplant			0
" based on @entity14 's unique and compelling story , we believe making a compassionate allowance in this case is appropriate , " said @entity69 , @entity70 chief medical officer , in a press release issued after the reversal of its decision			0
but last week , doctors determined @entity14 had a severe tracheomalacia , meaning his airway was so floppy it could not sustain itself			0
@entity14 would have needed to be on ventilation for years , and he would not have been eligible for the thymus transplant during that time because of the ventilation			1
it would have been impossible for @entity14 to stay free of infections and viruses for those years , @entity14 's mother , @entity84 , explained on the @entity11 page			2
" " he was such a little fighter			0
it was an honor to be his mom for 10 months , " she wrote			0
@entity14 's funeral will be saturday morning in @entity93 , @entity4 .			0

@entity14 went to a @entity7 hospital in hope of an organ transplant
he became the focus of media reports when a @entity56 *provider* denied coverage
coverage was granted , but another complication *prevented* the surgery
" he was such a little fighter , " his mother says
