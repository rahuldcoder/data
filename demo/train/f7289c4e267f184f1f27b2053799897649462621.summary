-- @entity1 emailed , tweeted and blogged monday about a may 3 event in which reporters are being invited to " come and meet the next @entity4			2
" at this shindig in @entity7 , we expect @entity1 to unveil the @entity8 -- though where this smartphone sits in @entity1 's larger handset ecosystem is n't entirely clear			1
the @entity8 would be the successor to the @entity13 , which was never a single phone , but rather a lineup of devices with varying internal specs and exterior designs for different countries and carriers			0
shoot , even the @entity13 's display sizes varied , with both 4.3 - inch and 4.5 - inch screens			1
and while the @entity13 has been the flagship @entity1 @entity22 device for @entity23 , @entity24 and @entity25 , the nation 's largest carrier , @entity27 , has avoided the @entity13 altogether			1
instead , @entity27 has gone all - in with the @entity29 , the first handset to boast the @entity22 4.0 operating system			1
by all accounts , the @entity29 is currently @entity1 's best @entity22 phone , its single - carrier limitation notwithstanding			1
but what will happen when the @entity8 is released ? this question , too , is complicated by the 5.3 - inch @entity35 , which has been a surprise hit for @entity1			1
more than 5 million @entity35 units have shipped worldwide -- and this is a phone that runs on the horribly antiquated @entity22 2.3 ( @entity39 )			0
with @entity1 making so many phones for different markets , carriers and countries , it 's difficult to figure out just where the @entity8 will reside in @entity1 's line - up , says @entity46 , executive director of the @entity48 market research firm			1
" @entity1 is producing a number of of high - end smartphones with leading - edge specs and , yes , that does make it tough to figure out which one their flagship phone is , " @entity46 told @entity0			1
" but @entity1 is one of the few companies out there that can make a lot of different phones with different functionality , geared toward different markets , that can all be considered flagship phones somewhere			0
" regardless , when the @entity8 is unveiled , the smartphone will be worthy of flagship status for at least a few carriers , @entity46 said			1
" the idea behind the @entity29 is to provide a pure @entity22 experience , " he said			2
" the @entity35 , which has the largest screen size of any handset in a major @entity69 carrier portfolio , is clearly about maximum screen real estate and the @entity35 for notes , annotation and drawing			0
each device has its trade offs and @entity1 is trying to have something out there for most anyone			0
" @entity46 says the @entity78 and @entity13 have been about reaching as many consumers as possible , and the @entity8 will likely be that type of phone as well , @entity46 said			0
" the reason there are so many versions of the @entity13 , and the @entity78 before it , is because the @entity78 line is about establishing a high - end baseline and having broad carrier reach , " he said			0
" the whole point is to sell as many of those phones as possible , so what they 're going for is top - of - the - line specs , but also mainstream consumer needs			0
" @entity94 , a @entity95 analyst , says @entity1 should be less worried about where the @entity8 lives in its broader line - up than how it stacks up against the @entity13 , which hit @entity69 shores last fall			1
conventional wisdom says the @entity8 will have a 4.7 - inch screen , quad - core processor , an 8 + mp camera , 4g connectivity and ( of course ) a custom , @entity1 - skinned version of @entity22 4.0			1
the @entity13 had almost - as - large screens , a dual - core processor , an 8 - megapixel rear camera , and @entity112 data support			0
" if the @entity8 is just like the @entity13 , but with slightly better specifications , then i think @entity1 will have a tough time selling it as differentiated product , " @entity94 said			2
" if that 's what @entity1 releases , the question will be , can @entity1 do what @entity120 does so well , with a refresh of an existing phone ? " she makes a compelling point : when you compare the @entity128 to the @entity129 , @entity120 's hardware specs are remarkably similar			2
in effect , @entity120 's most successful phone launch ever was built on the back of an extra cpu core , an improved camera , and a clever voice - recognition system with natural language comprehension ( @entity137 )			2
" @entity1 's brand is not @entity120 - strong yet , " @entity94 said			1
" i do n't know if @entity1 will ever reach that emotional level for the brand from the consumer standpoint			0
and that 's what makes this question of ' will the @entity8 be a big flagship phone ? ' so tricky			2
the @entity13 already has what most consumers are looking for from an @entity22 phone			2
" @entity1 's best chance at making the @entity8 a success would be introducing a ground - breaking new technology , she said			1
" i do n't think phones can get that much thinner , and i do n't think they need to get much bigger , " @entity94 said			0
" if @entity1 can release a phone with a flexible display , something they 've been experimenting with for awhile now , then they 'd be far ahead of the curve			0
if they do n't do something like that , they might have a hard time getting enough people to see the @entity8 as a truly differentiated product			0
