-- when it comes to buildings , they do n't come much different than a mosque and a nightclub			1
in @entity7 , these two structures have more in common than you might think			0
@entity10 is the designer behind both , her elegant creations blending sleek modernism with traditional ornamentation			1
crafting the inside of a building is hard enough , without also having to meet religious requirements , and @entity10 consulted @entity19 authorities throughout the construction of the spectacular @entity21 -- co-created by architect @entity22 -- and opened in 2009			1
it is believed to be the first time a woman has designed a mosque			1
the 59 - year - old has also designed two other mosques , both opened in @entity30 , @entity31 , in 2010			0
but regardless of religion , every place of worship has one thing in common , says the mother - of - one from @entity7			0
" " i think when you step inside a mosque , like any other religious building , you leave everything to do with the outside world , outside the door , " says the head of an interior design and architecture firm which has delivered over 350 projects across the globe			1
when not creating grand places of worship , @entity10 -- who has degrees in both computer science and art history -- turns her hand to everything from @entity58 restaurants , to @entity60 retail stores , and most recently her own line of furniture			1
divine design but when it comes to religious architecture , how do you design the inside of a building worthy of the divine ? " beneath the big dome you feel humility , " said @entity10 of the @entity21 , commissioned by a wealthy @entity70 family and built in one of @entity7 's oldest cemeteries			1
" at the same time , the beautiful chandeliers are much lower than normal , allowing people to feel more secure having this low light above their heads			0
" rather than walls , huge windows covered in intricate metalwork allow light to stream in , " caressing you much like the pages of the @entity84 , " explained @entity10			1
" it might be a color , it might be a texture , it might be a form			0
but each and every piece i have designed in the mosque has some kind of connection with tradition			2
" women worshipers when the time came for @entity10 to craft the inside of @entity21 , she purposely placed the women 's section in one of the most beautiful parts of the light - flooded dome			2
" i positioned them on the upper balcony , because during prayer the women must be behind the men , " she explained			0
" but i also decided to make the balcony level one of the most beautiful areas , with the chandelier crystal droplets just in front , and where you can see the mihrab [ an alcove pointing towards @entity117 ] from the best angle			0
" @entity119 growing up in @entity7 , a city which straddles both the continents of @entity121 and @entity122 , @entity10 was influenced by a rich mixture of modern and traditional buildings			1
and while she always admired the craftsmanship of the metropolis 's @entity127 era mosques , @entity10 had also become fed up with cramped and dark " bad copies			2
" " i wanted to be very contemporary with my design , " she said			2
" up until recently , modern architects did n't design mosques -- it was always religious architects			1
" a mosque is n't for a certain type of person , or certain type of area			2
it 's supposed to be used by anyone and everyone			0
that could be foreign @entity19 , or even @entity144 visitors coming to look at the building			0
" @entity10 might have made a name for herself designing mosques			2
but you need n't be religious to admire their beauty			0
art and culture : the enduring allure of @entity154 entertainment : @entity157 actress turned @entity159 recruiter science : the woman planning for a space catastrophe			0
