-- the leaders of the world 's arguably two most powerful nations are due to meet friday in southern @entity4			0
president @entity5 of the @entity6 and president @entity7 of @entity8 will hold talks that could shape relations between @entity11 and @entity12 for years to come			1
" this is an attempt to set out the ground rules for how our two countries will work together in the 21st century , " said @entity13 , who recently served as @entity6 assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs			2
officials in @entity12 are also trumpeting the potential importance of the event , the first time the two leaders have met in person since @entity7 became @entity8 's paramount leader			1
the meeting is of " profound historic and strategic significance , " @entity25 , a spokesman for the @entity8 foreign ministry , said thursday			2
the setting of the meeting , in the @entity31 estate outside @entity32 , is unusually informal and a far cry from the elaborately choreographed summits typically held between @entity8 and @entity6 leaders			1
" this is the first time in 50 years that leaders will sit down , somewhat unscripted , to have a real conversation about our relationship , " @entity13 said in an interview with @entity0 's @entity37			0
" it 's long overdue and important			0
" @entity45 allegations the issues of cybersecurity and @entity48 are expected to top the agenda			1
the @entity6 has recently become more vocal about linking cyberattacks on @entity6 businesses and government agencies to @entity8 authorities			1
the attacks allegedly to involve attempts to steal secret military and corporate technology and information			0
@entity12 has repeatedly denied the accusations , saying that hacking is a global problem , of which @entity8 is also a victim			0
but the chorus of voices arguing that the @entity8 stance is untenable is growing			0
" in the past , rogue behavior such as cybertheft may have provided a shortcut to greatness , " the editorial board of the @entity68 wrote this week			0
if @entity8 fails to evolve toward more responsible behavior both abroad and at home , a backlash that is already forming in the @entity6 and among its neighbors will swell			1
" some observers , however , have noted that @entity5 will have to raise cybersecurity and spying issues with @entity7 against the unflattering backdrop of recent reports alleging widespread surveillance of phone and @entity85 data by @entity6 intelligence agencies			1
@entity48 the two leaders may make progress on the @entity48 question , according to @entity13			2
" i think the @entity8 have just about had it with @entity48 , " he said			1
" they recognize that the steps that they have taken -- nuclear provocations -- are creating the context for more military activities on the part of the @entity6 and other countries that ultimately are not in @entity8 's best strategic interests			2
" tensions spiked on the @entity102 in march and april as the @entity48 unleashed a torrent of dramatic threats against the @entity6 and @entity105			2
the menacing rhetoric came amid @entity6 - @entity105 military drills and after the @entity108 had stepped up sanctions on @entity110 in response to the latest @entity113 nuclear test in february			1
the @entity6 officials called on @entity8 , @entity48 's key ally , to rein in the provocative behavior of @entity117 's regime			1
the situation in the region has become calmer in recent weeks			0
the clearest sign of a possible thaw in relations came thursday when @entity48 agreed to hold talks about reopening their shared industrial complex that @entity110 shut down in april			2
opinion : what @entity5 should tell @entity8 's @entity7 about @entity48 previous meeting friday is n't the first time @entity5 and @entity7 have met			1
the two leaders held talks in @entity11 last year , while @entity7 still held the title of vice president			0
during that visit , in addition to the more formal engagements , the @entity8 leader visited a small town in @entity138 , where he had stayed in the 1980s , when he was a provincial official			0
he also took in a @entity140 game in @entity32			0
opinion : ' @entity141 ' looking for trust at the top rights group : @entity5 must turn up the heat on @entity146			0

@entity5 and @entity7 are meeting at an estate outside @entity32
the setting is less formal than *traditional* summits between top leaders
observers say it is a *chance* to set the agenda for *future* @entity6 - @entity8 relations
cybersecurity and @entity48 are seen as the key issues
