-- if only what happened in @entity2 had stayed in @entity2			1
everything that made " @entity4 " such an unexpected hit -- its bold , brilliant pick - up - the - pieces story structure ; the way it reveled in exposing the wild side of its outwardly conventional ( if mismatched ) buddies ; and the big dose of strange that was @entity13 in his breakthrough movie role -- has been squandered and cheapened in two uninspired , largely mirthless and meretricious sequels			1
at least this time @entity18 and co-writer @entity19 have come up with some new beats in " @entity21 , " instead of presenting a carbon copy of the first film			1
( original writers @entity25 and @entity26 are long gone , of course			1
) if you 're looking for plot , they 've got one			1
it 's lazy , but at least it 's straightforward			1
@entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 ( @entity33 , @entity37 and @entity38 ) are escorting their emotionally volatile buddy @entity39 ( @entity13 ) to a rehab clinic when they 're forced off the road			2
crime boss @entity44 ( @entity45 ) explains -- at length -- how their old sparring partner @entity47 ( @entity49 ) has escaped from a @entity51 prison			2
@entity44 means to hold @entity36 captive until the @entity52 produces @entity47 and the gold bullion he stole			2
the hunt for @entity47 takes them to @entity56 , for no very good reason , then back to @entity58 , for closure ( we hope )			1
if @entity45 seems subdued after his big , boisterous turns in " @entity63 " and " flight , " it could be because the writing is so hack -- or maybe he figured there was just no way anyone was going further over the top than @entity49 , whose angry cokehead / rabid degenerate shtick is way beyond funny			2
his seething hatred for man and beast ( " make sure you kill the guard dogs , " he insists at one point ) is so venomous it smacks of some kind of warped integrity			2
not that @entity18 and company are aiming for warm and fuzzy here			0
the movie begins ( you probably saw a @entity87 version in the trailer ) with a giraffe coming to a sticky end on a highway overpass			0
after buttering us up with this grotesque roadkill , the writers follow through with a scene of @entity39 blithely badgering his father into a fatal heart attack			0
it 's daring , i suppose , almost a form of anti-comedy			0
it 's so divorced from anything you would want to laugh at			0
except that almost none of the audience i saw it with was laughing			0
too often , in " @entity21 , " profanity passes for wit and bad taste is equated with taboo - busting			0
if there is something subversive about @entity39 's man - love for @entity34 -- and @entity13 ' presexual overgrown adolescent remains the movie 's closeted comedic focal point -- it 's all bound up in an ugly tangle of homophobic taunts , male bonding cliches , and the virtual exclusion of the opposite sex ( @entity122 's solitary scene very much included )			0
for a series built on friendship , this is one cold and alienating movie , a comedy for sociopaths			1
the longer we hang out with these guys , the less fun they are to be with			0
and judging by the way he seems to be edging out of the frame all the time , i 'm guessing @entity33 feels the same way			1
it may represent a marginal improvement on the disastrous second film , but there must be a hole in the desert somewhere big enough to bury this sorry , sordid franchise once and for all .			0

the gang is all back for this " @entity148 " sequel
this time the *action* takes them to @entity56
critic calls it " a comedy for sociopaths "
