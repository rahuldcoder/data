-- the rumor blowing up saturday was that day 2 of the @entity2 could feature a surprise appearance by electronica icons @entity5			1
according to the @entity7 , it would probably take place during the set of headliners @entity10			1
but when the special guest finally materialized on the main stage , it was n't @entity5 , it was @entity15			2
the controversial @entity20 legend 's unexpected appearance prompted festival - goer @entity21 to reference last year 's popular @entity24 appearance on @entity25 : " production value has really gone up at ( @entity27 ) , it felt like @entity15 was really there ! # rkellyhologram " taking the stage near the end of night , @entity15 joined the headliners for a mashup of their " 1901 " and his " ignition			1
" @entity15 was n't the only @entity20 artist to make a cameo at @entity27 on saturday			1
@entity36 premiered his @entity47 - produced single " @entity46 " in the @entity38 tent during the @entity40 's set , and @entity41 made a guest appearance during the performance of her friends the xx			1
their special @entity27 remix of their cover of @entity51 's " @entity50 " and @entity41 's " locked in closets " injected an upbeat energy into an otherwise moody set			1
other saturday crowd - pleasers included the @entity56 , who had fans dancing and singing along to their 1983 hits " @entity58 , " " @entity59 " and " @entity60			2
" although the songs were released before most of the festival - goers were born , they were familiar because of their ubiquitous presence on @entity66 radio station @entity65			2
another day 2 favorite was @entity68 , the @entity69 rapper best known for the tracks " i 'm different " and " @entity71			1
" @entity27 organizers obviously underestimated his rabid fan base , and instead of slotting him onto the main stage , they relegated him to a much smaller tent			2
admirers spilled out the back and sides of the tent as puffy clouds of smoke rose from the crowd			0
@entity84 made his first appearance at @entity27 since 1999 , the festival 's debut year			1
even though he 's branched out as a musician in recent years , he returned to his @entity40 roots , playing the dance tent accompanied by visuals of outer space -- courtesy of his friends at @entity95			0
" when i was growing up , i was obsessed with science fiction , " he said			0
" and then i became obsessed with space and science , but i was a college dropout , so i was never smart enough to be a scientist			0
as a musician , i 've made friends with people at @entity95 , so every couple of years , i find myself doing something with them			0
this is my hometown festival in some ways , and i only get nervous performing when i know people in the audience			0
" on the flip side , @entity110 trotted out her retro soul revue			0
the singer / funktress was eager to kick off her debut			0
" i 've heard a lot about the festival			0
