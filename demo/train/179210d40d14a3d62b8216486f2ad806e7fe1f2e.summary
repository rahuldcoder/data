-- we 've come to know her as @entity3 , but before the world tours , " @entity6 " or even the dress made of meat , photographer @entity4 knew her simply as her restaurant co-worker , @entity3			1
in the summer of 2005 , @entity4 , who goes by @entity9 , happened to be tending bar at the same @entity12 restaurant where the 19 - year - old soon - to - be star worked as a waitress			1
just 24 at the time , @entity4 had moved from her native @entity16 to the @entity17 two years prior with dreams of becoming a photographer			1
but to support herself , " i started working as a bartender , " she recalled			2
" it was definitely a money thing			2
i did want to go to school , but i did n't do research on photography , my focus was to make better money			2
" keeping an eye on her bank account is what drove @entity4 to study accounting , leaving photography to become an amateur pursuit for a while			1
she went from taking landscape photos of @entity37 to setting up her own shoots , with @entity3 being among some of her first ones			1
" we were colleagues , we did n't hang out really heavily , but she 's the nicest girl ever			2
... she 's down - to - earth , " @entity4 said			1
" at that time , she gave me a cd of her first single , and i listened to it and i was really impressed			2
and she 's a beautiful girl			0
based on her looks and her personality i thought ( a photo shoot ) would be great fun			1
" @entity0 photos : @entity53 's exclusive and unseen photos of @entity3 back then , @entity3 " played piano and sang			1
this 19 - year - old girl , she was really talented			0
she did n't talk about it a lot , ( but ) she did say that she studied music			0
... i can not even explain to you what she sounds like with just a piano , then or now , " @entity4 said			1
" i offered her the photo shoot , and she said yes right away			1
" @entity3 had the perfect location in mind : her parents ' place on the @entity67			1
( @entity0 has reached out to @entity3 's rep for comment			2
) the two young women hopped on a train and headed over there , and set to work creating what @entity4 says became @entity3 's first photo shoot , although @entity4 did n't know that at the time			1
" the house was empty , it was just the two of us , " @entity4 said			2
" i knew she was a singer , so our focus was her and her very first piano			0
we just hung out in her parents ' living room , and the piano was right by the window			0
" " she 's a good model , obviously , " @entity4 added with a laugh			2
armed with just her first point - and - shoot camera , @entity4 let the intimate shoot unfold organically			1
" we had no plan			0
" " we basically walked into her house , she did hair and makeup , picked out the clothes and we started , " she recalled			0
the lighting was natural : " no strobe lights , nothing special , no tripods , " she said			0
" it was hand - held			0
" @entity4 , who 's never been formally trained , said she shot around 200 photos that day			1
after culling through the resulting images , choosing the photos with the best natural lighting , she presented @entity3 with a cd of the pictures			1
the burgeoning singer was happy with them , and used some of the art for her own promotional materials			0
of course , there 's no way @entity4 could have known that the young woman she photographed on a summer day in 2005 would become the international superstar she is today			2
as a matter of fact , @entity4 says that at first , when she saw her as @entity3 , she did n't recognize her , having been accustomed to her as a long - haired brunette waitress			1
even as @entity3 's fame continued to grow , @entity4 kept those early photos to herself " out of respect , " she said , particularly because she was n't in touch with her			1
and then , she just so happened to bump into her old colleague in 2010			0
" i actually ran into her in the @entity123 , and she came up to me			0
she was already @entity3 , and we spoke a little , and she leaned on me , and she said in my ear , ' did you know that this was my first photo shoot ? ' i had no idea , " @entity4 said			1
" she was really excited			0
from that moment on i figured i could do something about it			0
and she 's ok with it			0
" @entity4 hopes that those viewing the photos will get to see another side of @entity3 , a peek at who the star was before the world knew her name			1
but even with all the fame , to @entity53 , she 's " still the same girl			0
the fact that we ran into each other and she came up to me - she did n't say ' hi ' and run off			0
she stood there for 15 minutes , just chatting			0
she remembered my name , she remembered who i was , and she had so much to say			0
she 's still the same person to me			0

@entity4 worked at the same restaurant where @entity3 worked
" i offered her the photo shoot , and she said yes right away , " @entity4 said
@entity4 kept those early photos to herself " out of respect , " she said
