@entity0 -- a few days before the runoff elections that brought the @entity5 candidate to the presidency , i was invited along with other civil activists to meet @entity8			1
he did not show up , but his top advisers were present			0
after the long speech they gave about how @entity8 will empower the civil society and that the @entity5 will respect human rights including women 's rights , a colleague of mine raised his hand to ask a question			1
" i saw in your booklet that you respect human rights and women rights according to @entity24 , " my colleague asked			2
" is it different from the rights mentioned in the international conventions that @entity28 has signed ? " the answer given by one of the leader of @entity8 's campaign was shocking			1
" @entity24 values women more than the international conventions , " the @entity8 adviser said			1
" do you know that according to @entity24 the woman may choose not to breastfeed her child or clean the house until her husband pays her for doing this ? " he added confidently , to much laughter in the room			0
this simple conversation , more than anything , sums up how the @entity5 views women 's rights and what the status of women is likely to be under its rule			1
for while it may use the same terminology that we do , its perception of what those terms mean is completely different to that of liberal activists like me			0
they can not see a woman outside the biological stereotypes as a mother , child - bearer , and housewife			2
on the other side , activists like myself are working to establish women rights and gender equality in social , political , and civic spheres			2
actually , they always describe " women 's rights " as a western value and used to call it " women 's issues			1
" the space provided for women on the @entity5 's @entity5 website , for instance , is called " family oasis " and is full of stories about bringing up children , making your husband happy , the proper dress for the woman , and such topics that views women 's role exclusively within the family			1
the @entity5 in fact has a shameful record of marginalizing women in the group , until it needs to abuse them to beautify the group 's image			1
all through its history , the @entity5 sisters have never been allowed access to the leadership office of the @entity5 group			2
the @entity5 have changed this only in the past year by establishing the @entity103 political party			2
it hired some women in the supreme committee of the party , but they are the wives , daughters , or relatives of leading brothers			0
we do not know much about them and they rarely -- if ever -- appear in public to speak on behalf of their party			0
although the @entity5 allows women to run for parliamentary elections , they put them at the bottom of the ticket or support them with weak campaigns			1
the women chosen are merely the wives of the leaders , regardless of their skills or qualifications			0
thus , their chances to win are limited			0
this makes the group appear to be respecting women rights ; in reality it is doing the opposite			2
regardless of the fact that @entity5 declared in 2007 that they may never allow @entity28 " women or @entity138 " in decision - making positions , they did not hesitate to exploit women to appear more moderate than other @entity142 groups and appeal more to the political scene			1
in 2005 parliamentary elections , they put three women among the 133 candidates on their parliamentary election campaign platform			0
these women were the wives of prominent members in the group			0
they were politically weak and generally unpopular			0
one of them was @entity153 , who included many items in her political agenda that were clearly discriminatory towards women			0
her equivalent in the post-revolution parliament is @entity159 who has been lobbying against the 2003 legislation that criminalizes the savage practice of female genital mutilation			0
a few weeks after her statements , the @entity5 ' @entity163 launched a medical convoy that roamed upper @entity28 cities looking to circumcize girls			1
the @entity5 can not be solely blamed for the marginalization of @entity170 women , whose rights are almost grinding between two large stones			1
the first is the patriarchal mind - set that traps women in stereotypical female roles and stigmatizes any woman who tries to break out of this mold			0
the second is the rise of political islamists who encourage this patriarchal mentality and are wrongly interpreting religion to justify the social and political marginalization of women in the name of @entity187			0
one month after the revolution , we had a referendum on the constitutional amendments			0
massive number of @entity28 motivated by their hunger for democracy participated in the poll			2
as a woman rights activist , i seized the opportunity to test people 's willingness to include women in their vision of democracy			1
i ran a survey about whether " it is good for @entity28 to have a woman president " outside polling stations in three areas @entity209 , @entity210 , and @entity211			1
with the help of two interns , we surveyed 1453 people , including 634 women			0
the answer for my survey question was " 100 % no. " ironically , most of the words that followed this extreme " no " was loaded with much hatred and derision toward women			0
despite the impressive role of women in the revolution , most @entity28 still believe that women are made for kitchen not for office			1
i do not know @entity8 to pre-judge how women will be treated under his rule			1
yet , i know the history of the @entity5 that our new president came from			2
i know that they show respect to women rights only to hunt a political gain and then go back to mistreating them			2
if this happened this time , they will not be abusing the group 's women , they will be abusing @entity28 's women			1
i hope and pray every day that @entity8 will prove me wrong and does his best -- despite the @entity5 attitude toward women -- to empower @entity28 through empowering its women in their non-biological roles			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			0
