-- once the most popular smartphone , the @entity1 has been losing ground in the past year to @entity4 and @entity6 models			1
so @entity7 is trying to carve out a new market with the @entity9 ( the upcoming @entity1 tablet ) due to hit stores in the @entity11 and @entity12 on april 19			1
prices start at $ 499 , same as for the ipad 2			1
however , the @entity1 operating system is definitely not on the cutting edge of smartphone platforms			0
so there 's been ample skepticism about how attractive a @entity1 tablet might be to consumers , especially compared with slick offerings such as @entity23 's @entity14 and the growing array of @entity6 tablets			1
on march 24 , in a move apparently aimed at compensating for the weaknesses of the @entity28 and relatively lean @entity30 offerings , @entity7 announced that the @entity9 will support @entity6 apps , as well as the @entity33 - based apps that currently run on @entity1 smartphones			1
according to the news release , " @entity7 will launch two optional ' app players ' that provide an application run - time environment for @entity33 apps and @entity6 v2.3 apps			2
these new app players will allow users to download @entity33 apps and @entity6 apps from @entity30 and run them on their @entity9			1
" however , the release also notes that " the new app players for the @entity9 are expected to be available from @entity30 this summer			0
" so if you rush out to buy a @entity9 this spring , you 'll have to wait a few months to get those @entity6 apps and see how well they run			1
@entity1 clarified , " this does n't mean that @entity7 is working with @entity48 to bring @entity6 marketplace to @entity1 , but rather that developers who have made @entity6 apps can sign up as @entity30 developers ( which is now free of charge ) and distribute their apps to @entity9 owners via @entity30			1
" and as to the user experience , @entity1 notes , " because these @entity57 and blackberry smartphone apps will be running in a sandboxed environment , to use @entity7 's vocabulary we can likely expect the experience to be more along the lines of simple open - and - use ' apps ' rather than the deeply integrated ' super apps ' that @entity7 often likes to talk about			1
" media analyst @entity66 sharply criticized @entity7 's app strategy for the @entity9 , as well as @entity7 's entire business approach of late			2
he points out that touting the @entity9 as running @entity6 apps is misleading , since consumers wo n't be able to download apps from the @entity6 app market and run them on the @entity9			1
rather , developers will have to adapt their @entity6 apps to run within the @entity9 's app player and then get them approved to be offered in the @entity30 , a hurdle few developers are likely to be willing to jump for a new , unproven tablet with established competition			1
" launching what is clearly an immature product and trying to compensate for a dearth of applications with a misleading claim of compatibility with the wrong version of @entity6 is insane , " @entity66 wrote			0
i 'm puzzled by the market strategy here			0
clearly , @entity7 is using the @entity9 to push hard to get more users in the consumer media and gaming market			0
but that represents a huge away shift from the company 's original ( and still strong ) market base , which is mostly corporate users focused on messaging services			2
on that front , there 's a further complication : the @entity9 reportedly falls short in terms of supporting the integrated messaging services that die - hard @entity1 fans love			1
according to @entity110 : " @entity104 will first launch in a @entity106 only configuration ( @entity107 will sell a @entity109 version this summer )			0
that means the @entity9 can only snag emails and other data when in range of @entity106 hotspots			0
email , contacts , and calendar data are not ' live ' on the @entity9 as they are on a regular @entity1			2
in fact , the only way to access live corporate pim data is to tether a @entity1 to the @entity9 via @entity122			2
the @entity9 will then mirror whatever data is on the @entity1			2
" this sounds like a huge drawback for @entity7 's existing business users			0
it means that in order to take advantage of the features @entity1 users love , they 'll have to carry around both devices and take the time to tether them			0
it 's good that @entity7 is branching out in new directions , and a tablet makes sense			0
but why not build on the company 's strengths to create a robust tablet experience for business users rather than go flailing after the consumer and gaming markets , a strategy that pits the @entity9 squarely against the @entity14 ? does n't sound like a fair fight			0
the opinions expressed in this post are solely those of @entity149 .			0

@entity1 's @entity9 tablet hits stores april 19 and will start at $ 499
in an effort to make the @entity9 more attractive , @entity1 is opening it to @entity6 apps
but few @entity6 app developers may be willing to jump through hurdles for an unproven tablet
the @entity9 also falls short in terms of supporting integrated @entity1 messaging services
