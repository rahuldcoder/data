@entity0 , captain of the wrecked @entity3 cruise ship , took the stand for the first time tuesday , combative and contradicting the testimony of not just his first captain but also what he has said in the past about the deadly shipwreck			1
@entity11 -- who is charged with manslaughter , causing a maritime disaster and abandoning ship with passengers still on board -- denies wrongdoing			1
he faces up to 23 years in prison if convicted			0
he remained defiant even while painting a picture of confusion on board the ship as the disaster unfolded , pointing the finger at others for the chaotic evacuation of the ship 's passengers			1
five of the captain 's co-workers have already entered guilty pleas in the case , including officers who were on the ship			1
these pleas may work against @entity11 as he answers questions with regard to the co-workers ' testimony before the court in @entity42			1
when shown the deposition given by his first captain , @entity44 , who pleaded guilty to manslaughter in exchange for a lighter sentence , @entity11 was argumentative and gesticulated wildly			1
what @entity44 told the court in his testimony is similar to the version of events @entity11 has given in past tv interviews , but the captain contradicted that version in his testimony tuesday			1
@entity11 's attorneys argued that what the captain has previously said on @entity61 tv can not be used as evidence in court			1
the disputed testimony deals with such details as radar readings , who was on the bridge at the time of the accident and where those people were positioned			1
speaking to @entity72 during a court break , @entity11 said he was confident about how his trial was progressing			2
" it is exhausting , but i think it is going well , " @entity11 said of tuesday 's hearing			1
" it is important because this is the only chance i have to tell my version of events			1
" asked if he thought the court was sympathetic to him , he said , " this is the first time i have had a chance to officially address the court personally so this should be the first time they should be judging me			2
" his testimony is expected to continue wednesday and probably one day next week			0
the cruise liner capsized after it struck rocks off @entity91 's @entity90 in the @entity92 on january 12 , 2012			1
no one died on impact , but 32 lives were lost during the subsequent chaotic evacuation of some 4,200 people on board the ship			1
chaos on the bridge @entity11 was sworn in under a giant sign reading , " the law is equal for everyone , " in a makeshift courtroom in @entity105 's red velvet @entity106			1
as assistant prosecutor @entity110 questioned @entity11 , the captain described a scene of utter chaos on the bridge both before and after the accident			1
at one point he explained how it was common to invite passengers and guests on the bridge , and said they often tipped him			0
" i said there could n't be more than 12 people at a time , " he said			2
" and they would bring 20 , 30 , 70 euro a tour			0
" he acknowledged frequently conducting flyby activities -- deviating from the planned route to go closer to certain places -- with his cruise ship			0
" it was favorable from a commercial aspect , " he said			0
when the prosecutor asked if he had ever done a flyby past @entity90 before , he said he could n't remember but might have passed close by			0
' not trying to blame anyone ' @entity11 also explained why he chose @entity90 on this occasion , telling the court that he thought retired @entity136 capt. @entity136 was on the island			2
when the prosecutor asked @entity11 why he called @entity139 and then why he asked @entity136 how deep the coastal waters were , he said he was just making conversation			2
@entity11 recounted how he gave the orders to the helmsman , @entity143 of @entity144 , to go off course after using his binoculars to look ahead			2
when asked if his helmsman caused the accident , he said : " i 'm not trying to blame anyone			0
i 'm just trying to explain the circumstances			0
" the captain has suggested @entity143 did not speak @entity151 or @entity61 well enough to understand his orders -- although audiotape played in court tuesday appeared to contradict that			0
pushed as to why he used his binoculars instead of relying on the radar , @entity11 said , " it was my habit to take my binoculars and look first			2
not that i did n't trust the radar , but it was how i did it			0
" he was confident that the ship had enough room for the maneuver , he said			0
in an audiotape played over the radar from the bridge extracted from the ship 's data recorder , @entity11 told his helmsman to turn , " otherwise we go on the rocks			1
" asked why he made that comment , he said he was being ironic			0
" a few minutes later , i was told the danger we were in			0
" alarm bells @entity11 appeared visibly shaken , putting his head in his hands , shortly after radar and audio recordings of the moment of impact were played in court			2
bells and alarms rang , and then the recording went offline			0
the prosecutor asked @entity11 about his last words captured on tape			2
" but where did we touch ? " the captain asked , to which someone said , " oh my dear @entity192			0
" @entity11 also will be cross-examined by a number of civil parties at the court			2
they include the attorney for a @entity199 dancer who dined with the captain and was with him on the command bridge at the time of the shipwreck			1
' ready to defend his honor ' before the hearing began , @entity11 's attorney , @entity205 , told @entity72 his client was ready to tell the truth			1
" we have waited a long time to set the record straight , " he said			0
" he is ready to defend his honor			0
" @entity11 has repeatedly presented a defiant face over the shipwreck			0
he has pointed the finger at the @entity216 cruise company for not providing maps with the rocks he hit appropriately marked			0
@entity11 has also blamed the ship , saying generators did not work so the elevators did not function , which hindered some people 's escape .			1
