-- it has only ever happened between two sets of sisters in the history of tennis , but @entity6 and @entity7 could yet become the next female siblings to meet in a major final			1
way back in 1890 , in only the fourth edition of what would become today 's @entity13 , @entity14 -- a first cousin of future president @entity16 -- beat her sister @entity17 , a feat that would be unmatched for more than a century			2
when it did happen again , at the @entity13 in 2001 , it marked the first of eight grand slam finals between the @entity23 sisters -- with @entity24 beating younger sister @entity23 on the first occasion , but losing six of seven since			1
with @entity7 having risen from 109th to 31st in the rankings during the 2012 season , her trajectory suggests there is every chance that the @entity7 sisters -- both of whom won @entity33 as juniors -- could one day meet in a grand slam final			1
they have met in a grand slam before , with @entity7 -- the younger at 22 -- briefly losing her usual cool en route to defeat in the first round of the @entity41			1
" i do n't ever want to play her in the first round , but in the final -- no problem , " laughs 24 - year - old " @entity45 , " whose total prize money of $ 12 million dwarfs that of her sibling 's $ 1 million , reflecting her higher status as world no. 4			1
almost identical while the @entity56 ' less powerful version of tennis will never be a match for the record - breaking @entity23 duo , one thing they do share with the @entity54 is a tight bond			1
" we are best friends , we are so close , " @entity7 told @entity0 's @entity61			1
" we have always been together -- participating , living and traveling together -- so it is nice to have my sister on tour			0
" we share things , we go shopping and we have a good time , so sometimes when i am traveling alone without her i feel so lonely			0
" the feeling is so mutual that precisely the same words come out of her elder sister 's mouth			2
" my sister and i have been traveling everywhere together for the last 18 years -- the same school , same practice , " @entity6 says			0
" we are best friends , we are so close			0
" save for their hair color -- with @entity45 a brunette and @entity7 a blonde -- and the 21 months that separate their dates of birth , there is little between them , says the firstborn			1
" we are very similar personalities -- we like to have fun , " says one of the female circuit 's most popular players			0
" when we are on court , we like to work hard			0
but off the court , we try to have fun and relax , go to the cinema and forget about tennis			2
" what 's different about us ? we like some different food ! there 's not much difference			0
" pride of @entity56 unlike the @entity23 sisters , whose homeland had been previously represented by such greats as @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110 ( and that 's not even mentioning the men ) , the @entity104 are putting their country on the tennis map			1
prior to them , just two @entity56 had made noteworthy contributions to international tennis			2
in the late 1970s , @entity118 reached the @entity119 on the men 's @entity120 while much further back , @entity122 reached three grand slam finals in the 1930s which -- even if she did n't win one -- is still the @entity56 record for the @entity104 to beat			2
@entity45 made her own slice of history in 2007 , becoming the first pole to win a @entity131 singles title when as an 18 - year - old she beat @entity134 's @entity133 in @entity136 's @entity135			1
she has pressed on since , adding a further 11 @entity131 titles and reaching her highest ranking of no. 2 in 2012 , a year when she reached her first grand slam final -- albeit beaten by ( who else ? ) @entity23 at @entity33			2
nonetheless , she was the first pole to contest a grand slam final since the @entity143 began in 1968 -- even if her defeat meant she missed out on a long - held dream			0
" i was really close to being world no. 1 a few times in 2012 but unfortunately i did n't make it , " she says			0
" hopefully , i will have another chance in 2013			0
that is the goal i have been working for for so many years -- to be number one , even for one week			0
" after a slower start , @entity7 -- currently ranked 37th -- may feel as though she is beginning to make her mark , with 2012 having proved a breakthrough year following a back problem that hindered her early progress as a professional			2
she may never have progressed past the second round of any grand slam singles event , but she did break into the top 30 for the first time and reached her first @entity131 final at the @entity162 in the @entity163			1
" i am very happy for her that she is doing well , " says @entity6			0
" she is working really hard for that , she has been through a lot of things and i am happy that she has made the top 30 already			0
" hopefully , i 'll see her in the top 10 very soon -- there 's a big chance			1
" fatherly guidance much like @entity23 and @entity24 , the @entity56 were first taught by their father -- although in contrast to @entity174 , @entity175 did have a coaching background prior to his daughters ' births			1
those searching for differences can point to @entity6 's birthplace of @entity182 differing to @entity7 's in @entity183 , since her father was then working in the north - western @entity186 town as the local tennis pro. his profession meant the girls were surrounded by tennis from birth , with early images showing the sisters in the midst of bats and balls -- and one memorable picture showing them tottering around like ballerinas , albeit with their feet squeezed into tennis ball canisters			1
their father coached @entity45 and @entity7 from the ages of five and four respectively but he stopped traveling last year , and both are now working with @entity203 ( @entity205 's former coach ) as well as @entity56 @entity207 coach @entity206			1
nonetheless , @entity175 still trains his girls whenever they go home to @entity182			2
" this is our home so we love coming back , " says @entity7 of @entity56 's second largest city			1
" our family is here but it 's good that i have a sister so i can always practice with her			2
i do n't have to find a hitting partner and also our coach is our dad , so it 's perfect			0
" the historic city is by no means perfect for the tennis professionals -- it has no hard court , for example -- but its enduring appeal for the girls more than makes up for that			0
" it 's always a great feeling to be here , especially since we are traveling 10 months a year , " says @entity45			1
" even if i can only go home for two days , i will as it 's always nice to just sit on my couch , watch tv and be in my kitchen			0
those two days make a huge difference -- it feels like i have a normal life			0
" for the rest of the year , the sisters are largely on the road -- sometimes together , sometimes not -- and they always find a way of staying in contact			0
" when something 's happened to me , @entity45 is the first to know , " says @entity7			1
" we talk to each other all the time -- on @entity244 , over the phone , texting			0
we are always in touch			0
" sister act more often than not , they are normally in the same place -- and not just playing singles , but also teaming up for doubles together			0
in @entity257 last year , where @entity253 was honored to be @entity56 's @entity256 flag bearer , they had mixed fortunes , exiting the @entity259 in the second round before withdrawing from the third round at @entity33 to help @entity45 , suffering from illness , in her singles bid			1
with a @entity131 doubles title already to their name , at @entity268 in 2007 , the next step is to join the select band of sisters to have won a grand slam doubles title -- with the @entity23 and @entity273 joined only by @entity275 @entity274 and @entity276 in the history books			2
even if they fail , one thing is for sure -- the @entity7 sisters are inspiring the next generation of @entity56 tennis players			1
" i can clearly see that tennis in @entity56 is getting better			2
a lot of kids are trying to play right now and trying to be professionals -- so it 's nice to see that -- and people are talking more about tennis so it 's becoming more popular , " says @entity7			1
" and when i see @entity45 having great results , i want to be the same or even better			0
