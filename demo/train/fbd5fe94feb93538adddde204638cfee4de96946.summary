-- @entity2 biologist @entity1 is taking " waste not , want not " to a whole other level			0
@entity5 discovered first hand how damaging the @entity8 crayfish can be			1
she says crayfish carcasses the part of the crustacean that humans often throw away are for the birds			2
as higher chicken feed costs push multi-national chicken firms like @entity16 and @entity17 to report losses this year , @entity1 says crayfish waste is an alternative source for the protein and minerals necessary to raise chickens			1
@entity1 earned her phd exploring the use of crayfish as chicken feed			1
her studies included comparing chickens fed with fish meal , with those raised on meal made with crayfish waste			2
" the group of chickens [ that we raised ] on crayfish have stronger bones , have a higher optical density of meat			2
the color of the meat is better , the taste is better , it looks better , " she says			0
the crayfish carcass is largely shell and skeleton			0
feed nutritionists say crayfish - sourced feed would therefore contain high percentages of calcium and minerals			1
as a result , @entity1 says , her experiments show that chickens raised on a crayfish feed diet lay more , stronger , higher - protein eggs			2
but poultry nutrition experts warn that chicken farming is a complex science that involves multiple nutrition and energy needs			0
" the challenge has to do more with genetics , and the right balance for this fast growing bird , " says @entity63 , @entity64 for an @entity66 specialist poultry feed supplier			0
" crayfish heads will have some meat in there for protein			0
crayfish skeletons will have calcium and i 'm sure there is a nutritional value but perhaps [ feeding crayfish to chickens ] is a leap too far for now , " @entity63 says			0
@entity82 is experiencing a crayfish invasion along the @entity8			1
scientists like dr. @entity85 , who also works at @entity2 , say there are unprecedented numbers of crayfish thriving in the @entity8 with no natural predator , from the @entity90 or from the south of @entity82			1
the crayfish that have a penchant for clawing into fishermen 's nets and eating their catch are causing problems for fishermen			1
but are there enough crayfish to sustain a chicken feed industry ? @entity102 , a spokesman with the @entity104 's largest feed manufacturer @entity103 is unsure			1
" theoretically , it is possible to use crayfish remains , but they would be in such short supply it would not be a feasible solution			0
for manufacturers who make any kind any business on a large scale , there 's not enough [ crayfish ] supply to be a viable business			2
however , it could be better for a niche market , " he says .			0

@entity0 's @entity5 spent time with @entity8 fishermen in @entity82
@entity82 is experiencing a crayfish invasion along the @entity8 .
crayfish have been a problem for fishermen , but now used in chicken feed
