-- with its approximately 480 million adherents , @entity1 is home to an overwhelming plurality of the world 's @entity4			1
but no one from this region ( or hemisphere , for that matter ) has been ever been chosen to lead the church as pope			1
as the church 's cardinals gather in the @entity16 to select a new pontiff , the idea of a @entity1 pope rises again			1
there was talk of a @entity1 pope in 2005 -- the last time there was a papal conclave -- but secrecy surrounding the process made it difficult to discern how seriously those candidacies were taken			1
live blog : picking a new pope @entity29 , a political science professor at the @entity30 who researched this question , said he believes there was really no serious candidate from @entity1 at the time			1
this go - round is a different story , he says			2
a number of cardinals from the region have been suggested as pope candidates , according to @entity41 , and they include the @entity43 @entity42 and @entity44 , @entity46 's @entity45 and @entity47 , and @entity48			1
a look at papal contenders @entity43 and @entity51 have the two largest @entity53 populations in the world , with more than 133 million and 96 million believers , respectively			1
however , those numbers have been on the decline , while @entity58 and evangelicalism are on the rise			2
" i really think that in choosing someone from the global south , there is important symbolism , but also , their life histories are very different " from previous popes , @entity41 said			2
@entity69 from @entity1 have seen the tremendous inequalities that exist in their countries firsthand , and many played a role in their nations ' transition to democracy , he said			1
" it would be an enormous gesture to name a @entity1 pope , " said @entity77 , a professor of history and religious studies at the @entity80			1
precisely because @entity53 is losing ground in the region , a pope from there could be a boost for the faith , she said			1
@entity42 , the archbishop of @entity90 , is an especially intriguing possibility , as he is a @entity92 insider and of @entity94 descent , which ties him to the traditional @entity97 papal picks , she said			2
even though about 39 % of all @entity4 live in @entity1 , only 17 % of the cardinal electors hail from there , according to the @entity99			1
selecting a pope still , the cardinals listed above appear on many of the speculative lists of top contenders for the papacy			1
" in terms of trying to prognosticate who the next pope will be , that is a hazardous enterprise , " said the rev. @entity106 , professor and coordinator of hispanic / latino programs at the @entity109			1
still , he says , " the choice of a pope from the @entity116 or @entity117 would be quite appropriate			1
" the fact that the last two popes , @entity120 and @entity121 , were not from @entity122 showed the " internationalization " of the papacy , he said			2
a pick from the @entity126 would extend that reach , he said			2
as it is , a growing @entity129 population in the @entity130 has led the church to put a greater emphasis on @entity135 populations , @entity106 said			0
" the selection of a @entity1 pope would be particularly welcomed by @entity138 and @entity135 in the @entity130 , " he said			1
candidates from @entity1 , however , are not free from criticism and face challenges			1
in the region , as elsewhere , sex scandals have rocked the church and raised questions about how the incidents were handled			0
there is also the lingering criticism that the church was too passive during the repressive dictatorships in the region			0
a look at some of the names suggested as papal candidates from @entity1 : @entity42 , @entity43 : at 63 , he is one of the youngest candidates			1
@entity42 , the archbishop of @entity90 , is known as warm , funny and gregarious			0
as one of the few cardinals who uses @entity159 , he is seen as having a connection to young people , as well			1
he worked in the all - important @entity162 from 1994 to 2001			0
" so he 's both an outsider and an insider			0
that 's a pretty good position heading into this conclave , " @entity0 @entity92 analyst @entity165 said			0
@entity44 , @entity43 : as a young priest , bullets riddled his chest and face as the young priest was caught in the crossfire of a robbery			0
he still carried bullet fragments			0
he entered the seminary at age 11 and rose up the ranks to become the archbishop of @entity180			0
" he is sweet and open and gentle , " @entity165 said			0
" i think the big question mark about him is precisely because he 's such a nice guy : does he really have the steel and the spine to be able to get his hands around the very complex bureaucracy of the @entity92			0
" @entity47 , @entity46 : a veteran diplomat of the @entity92 who has served in high - ranking posts , @entity47 is considered serious but friendly			0
he became known as the " voice of the pope " when he spoke for @entity120 after the pope lost the ability to speak due to his health			2
@entity47 was the one who announced the pope 's death to the world			2
@entity45 , @entity46 : until last year , @entity45 was the archbishop of @entity200 before stepping down because of his age			0
@entity45 is considered a straight - shooter who calls things as he sees them , and a follower of the church 's most conservative wing			0
he has clashed with the government of president @entity209 over his opposition to gay marriage and free distribution of contraceptives			0
@entity48 , @entity214 : the @entity214 was elevated to cardinal by @entity120 , and his name had been suggested in 2005 as a possible successor to the papacy			2
he speaks eight languages , holds degrees in theology , clinical psychology and psychiatry , and is a pilot			0
he is 71 years old			0
@entity0 's @entity224 and @entity225 and journalist @entity226 contributed to this report .			0
