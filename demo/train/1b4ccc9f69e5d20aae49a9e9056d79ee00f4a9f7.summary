-- @entity1 bet big on the @entity2 -- and 350,000 apps later , competitors are struggling to catch up			2
now , there 's @entity7 's @entity6 , @entity9 's @entity8 , @entity11 's @entity10 , and @entity13 's @entity12			0
but while @entity1 still leads the pack with an astonishing 82.7 % market share , the app race is far from over			1
according to a new report by @entity19 , the app market will explode to a $ 38 billion industry by 2015 , riding the huge growth in popularity of mobile devices from smartphones to tablets to whatever @entity1 dreams up next			2
in 2010 , apps on these devices pulled in $ 1.7 billion globally , meaning the market will blossom exponentially in the coming years			1
" the explosion of app development that started on the @entity31 only scratches the surface of what 's about to emerge , " the report says			0
what 's more , the average cost of paid apps is only $ 2.43 , with just 33 % of smartphone users downloading apps on a monthly basis , says @entity19			1
once more smartphones from @entity7 , @entity13 , and @entity41 roll out , and more tablets from @entity43 and @entity44 , app sales and volume will only increase			0
the question now is whether any of those competitors will be able to catch up to @entity1 by 2015 , or whether they 'll only create a fractured marketplace			0
and if @entity1 were able to retain just a 50 % market share in the coming years , it 'd be pulling in close to $ 20 billion from app sales -- roughly a third of its current total annual revenues			1
