" i could have been @entity2 manager			2
i was , at that time , maybe the proudest manager in the world because , especially for a foreign coach , to have the possibility of leading a country like @entity2 , i was the proudest man in the world , " he said on tuesday evening			1
" i thought and thought and thought , and i was fighting with myself because one side wanted and the other side knew it was not the job for me , for my mentality , for my passion of football , for training every day			0
