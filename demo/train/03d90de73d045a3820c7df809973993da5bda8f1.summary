@entity1 prime minister @entity0 has laid out his battle plan to counter the threat posed by @entity5 extremists returning to @entity1 after fighting with terror groups overseas			1
but already there are questions about how effective those measures would be , whether they are legal and whether @entity0 , who heads a coalition government , can push them through @entity11			1
" dealing with this terrorist threat is not just about new powers , it is also about how we combat extremism in all its forms , " he said as he announced his plans monday			1
his proposals , which come after the @entity1 government raised its terror threat level friday from " substantial " to " severe , " include a radical new measure to ban @entity1 from coming home once they join jihadi ranks abroad			1
" what we need is a targeted , discretionary power to allow us to exclude @entity1 nationals from the @entity1 , " he said			1
@entity0 wants to confiscate passports from would - be fighters , before they travel , and ban other suspects from boarding planes			1
" passports are not an automatic right , " he said			2
" we will introduce specific and targeted legislation to fill this gap by providing the police with a temporary power to seize a passport at the border , during which time they will be able to investigate the individual concerned			2
" this power will include appropriate safeguards and oversight arrangements			2
" work to prepare legislation to allow this will begin immediately , @entity0 said			1
civil liberties issue as well as stopping would - be jihadists , @entity0 said @entity1 needed measures to prevent the return of foreign fighters			1
@entity1 authorities estimate that 500 @entity1 have gone to @entity51 and @entity52 to fight with @entity5 groups			1
but opposition lawmakers question whether some of the toughest plans are legal			0
" we very much want to see the detail of that because some of our mps say to do that would breach a whole number of legal and international obligations this country has , " said @entity57 , a @entity58 lawmaker and shadow @entity60 minister for security and crime			0
she backs tough action but insists there must be a balance			0
" i can categorically say that civil liberties is a big issue in any debate we have about any new powers			2
" the head of @entity1 's counter-terrorism efforts , assistant commissioner @entity79 , said in a statement tuesday that in response to the raised alert level , more police would be seen on the streets and that there would be an increase in vehicle searches and other security measures			1
secret evidence pledges to safeguard citizens ' rights ring hollow to @entity94 - convert @entity95			2
in 2006 , he was detained by @entity1 security agents under anti-terror laws			1
he told @entity99 he was headed to @entity51 to volunteer helping orphans			1
the @entity51 civil war had n't started , and @entity102 did n't yet exist			1
" suddenly you go on the basis of secret evidence from being an ordinary member of the public to the worst of the worst , " said @entity103			0
" terrorism and terrorists are some of the most heinous and horrible of people			0
i did n't even know what i was accused of			0
" he believes he came under suspicion because he had unwittingly , he says , become friends with the brother of a jailed terrorist			0
@entity103 was never arrested , never convicted of a crime , nor told what evidence security services had against him			0
the @entity1 government imposed a " control order " on him , banning him from traveling or meeting friends and subjecting him to a curfew			1
" a couple of times a week the police would come and you ca n't stop them and they would search your house , " he added			0
two years later , a top court exonerated him			0
@entity103 : bring suspects to trial as part of his new anti-terror drive , @entity0 proposes beefing up existing terrorism prevention and investigation measures , or @entity136 , which allow restrictions on terror suspects , including overnight residence at a specified address , gps tagging , reporting requirements , and restrictions on travel , movement , association , communication , finances , work and study			1
@entity0 said he would introduce legislation giving @entity1 authorities new powers that would strengthen their ability to track suspected supporters of @entity102 , by providing " enhanced use of exclusion zones " or " relocation powers			1
" but @entity103 opposes that approach			0
" if somebody is a danger to the @entity1 public , then they need to be in a @entity1 prison , " he said			2
" the only way to do that is to bring charges and a trial in an open and fair court			0
if they 're not a dangerous person , then you 're oppressing them for no reason			0
" far from defending against radical @entity175 , @entity103 fears tougher government powers risk turning @entity1 into a police state			1
analyst : @entity1 threat is greater officials in the @entity181 say there are no plans to issue a terror alert there , despite the activities of @entity102 , also known as the " @entity187 " or @entity102 , in @entity52 and @entity51			1
" the most detailed intelligence assessment that i can offer from here is that there is no evidence or indication right now that @entity102 is actively plotting to attack the @entity181 homeland , " @entity189 spokesman @entity188 said			0
@entity181 secretary of homeland security @entity196 also pointed out there is no specific threat against the @entity181			2
that said , @entity57 noted that @entity102 has proved to be a threat to @entity181 overseas -- notably the execution of @entity181 journalist @entity203 and the threats of more killings to follow			2
@entity206 , a @entity99 terrorism analyst , said , " the threat is much greater in the @entity1 , and that 's why you are seeing a raft of new measures in the @entity1 to try and tackle this problem			1
they are very , very worried that @entity102 may try and retaliate in some form or way			0
" @entity1 pm : police need power to seize passports of would - be jihad suspects opportunity for @entity221 ? while the world 's attention is focused on @entity102 , a suspected @entity181 drone strike against senior leaders of @entity226 in southern @entity227 on monday has highlighted continuing concern about extremists elsewhere			1
@entity230 , a security analyst and managing director of @entity232 , told @entity99 that the merging and consolidation of different @entity5 militant groups around the world were of big concern			0
" you will have various groups working together , sharing resources , sharing capability , and in this particular region , it 's important to try to dismantle it where possible , " he said			0
@entity227 's porous borders mean it presents a particular risk , he added			0
@entity247 , a senior fellow at the @entity249 - based @entity248 , said it would be " a mistake to take our eye off the ball when it comes it @entity221 " and warned that the rise of @entity102 could aid the terror network			2
before his death , @entity258 wanted to rebrand @entity221 , @entity247 said			0
" he believed that its brand had been very much diminished by the excesses of @entity263 , who had led @entity221 in @entity52 , which became @entity102 later on , " he said			2
" with @entity102 's rise , it gives @entity221 a prime opportunity to rebrand itself as being a more rational , more moderate voice of jihadism , and as a result i think there 's a lot of risks of more money channeling into the @entity221 network			0
" some will come from quite moderate countries in the region who are looking at whether or not @entity221 and some of its offshoots , such as @entity278 in @entity51 , could be viewed as a counterweight to @entity102 , @entity247 said			2
" it will be seen , i think , as a real problem for us in the longer term , " he added .			0
