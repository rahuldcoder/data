@entity3 and @entity6 : how the conflict reignited what is it ? the name @entity2 evokes an image of a protective bubble over a city			2
in practice , @entity2 is a defense against short - range rockets and mortar shells : the system targets incoming rockets and fires an interceptor missile to destroy them midair			1
each battery has a firing - control radar to identify targets and a portable missile launcher			0
the system is easily transportable , with just a few hours needed to relocate and set up			0
the missile is highly maneuverable			0
it is three meters , or almost 10 feet , long ; has a diameter of about six inches ; and weighs 90 kilograms , or 198 pounds , according to the security analysis group @entity37 's			0

@entity2 confronts multiple threats simultaneously , in all weather conditions , the @entity3 military said			1
" the radar detects a rocket launch and passes information regarding its path to the control center , which calculates the predicted point of impact , " the @entity11 said			0
" if this location justifies an interception , a missile is fired to intercept the rocket			0
the payload of the interceptor missile explodes near the rocket , in a place that is not expected to cause injuries			0
" each @entity2 battery costs $ 50 million , @entity38 's said			1
a missile costs at least $ 62,000 , @entity3 officials said			2
@entity80 : photos from inside the protests in @entity3 is the @entity83 involved in @entity2 ? yes			1
