-- ever since the 2003 invasion of @entity3 exposed deep - rooted religious and ethnic divisions , analysts have suggested giving up on the colonial - era borders of modern @entity3 and dividing the country			1
jihadists have felt the opposite , that the region should be united into a new caliphate -- indeed that is precisely what the militant group the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) declared this week			1
the lines drawn by the @entity18 and @entity19 colonial powers in 1916 became , after the collapse of the @entity21 , the borders of new @entity24 states			1
over the years , these lines splitting the @entity26 into @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity3 have been enormously contentious , to the extent that it is often argued the region might be better without them			1
either removing these lines altogether and returning to the world of the early 20th century , or drawing them smaller and tighter still			0
certainly the idea of closer union among the @entity24 countries has been tried , in various forms , over the decades since the close of the @entity40			1
but what should work in theory has n't worked in practice -- the most ambitious attempt , the @entity45 , practically destroyed liberal , secular politics for a generation			1
conversely , the lines in the sand of @entity50 , which should not have worked in practice , have held , broadly , for decades			1
that does n't mean they are perfect			0
but at a time of immense upheaval in the @entity57 , they may be better than the alternative			0
the end of the caliphate necessitated a new search for political organization in the region			2
but if the joining together of all the @entity24 lands in a new caliphate is not a realistic answer to the real political questions of the @entity57 , nor is the oft - proposed division of @entity3 into smaller statelets			1
dividing @entity3 ever since the invasion of @entity3 in 2003 , the division of @entity3 into three parts -- roughly , a @entity73 north , a @entity75 middle and a @entity76 south -- has been proposed earnestly , often by people with barely any knowledge of the region , its peoples and societies			1
the casualness with which the suggestion of such an immense change is made mirrors the callous approach taken by the colonial surveyors who first drew these borders , seeking to change the lives of nations with the stroke of a pen			1
as recently as 2006 , the @entity95 vice-president @entity94 argued that @entity3 should be partitioned , and even the @entity97 foreign minister , two weeks ago , in a tone that suggests he was simply exasperated with the complexity of the situation , said it might be difficult to prevent @entity3 splitting apart			1
such a project , however , faces immense technical as well as human challenges , which are rarely addressed			0
any division of @entity3 has to take into account people , politics and economics			1
in the most often suggested scenario , the northern @entity73 region would take the oil - fields around @entity111 in the north , the @entity76 state would take the capital @entity114 and the main port in the southern city of @entity117 , leaving a @entity75 rump state in the west , denuded of resources with which to survive			0
moreover , the new smaller @entity76 state in the south would come under @entity124 's influence , extending @entity126 's reach into a state that would now border @entity128 and @entity129			2
the idea that this division would solve anything is a dangerous fantasy			0
as things stand today , an attempt to divide @entity3 would not occur calmly but would be a furious scramble for the country 's resources , as well as a rush by @entity3 's neighbors for influence over the three new states in their midst			1
it would not solve the problem			0
rather it would entrench the failures of politicians , writing failed policies across the lines of a map			0
mass migration moreover , drawing new borders along religious lines would mean a mass movement of hundreds of thousands , perhaps millions , of people			0
an estimated one million @entity3 are already on the move within @entity3 , internally displaced from their homes			1
any attempt to divide @entity3 into different countries would mean many more			1
to ask or force so many to move , even from , say , @entity114 to @entity117 , would mean uprooting them from jobs , friends and families			0
it would need a strategy to ensure that there are sufficient jobs waiting , that there are schools for the children to attend , that there are apartments and houses for people to live in			0
mass migration can not be accomplished safely by speeches alone			0
even with the most extensive planning , the results would likely be chaotic			0
as @entity183 , former deputy @entity3 ambassador to the @entity185 , pointed out two weeks ago : " if @entity3 falls apart , it will not fall apart into three neat pieces			1
what you 're much more likely to see is a @entity188 in @entity3			2
" @entity3 are simply too mixed together			2
even today , more than a decade after the invasion of @entity3 , the same mistakes of understanding are made			2
one is to imagine a neat division of @entity75 , shia and @entity73 , mixing up ethnic and religious categories			0
the @entity73 , after all , are mainly @entity75 and both @entity75 and @entity76 and @entity195 are @entity24			2
add to that mix the other minorities of @entity3 , the @entity197 , the @entity197 , the @entity198			2
in a divided @entity3 , where would they go ? if the answer is that they could stay as minorities in the areas they currently live , why could n't that formulation equally apply to @entity75 in @entity76 areas and @entity76 in @entity75 areas ? another is to imagine that such neat distinctions continue in real life			2
in fact , until the @entity3 war unleashed political forces that fanned the flames of sectarianism , the idea of division along sect or religion was broadly unknown in @entity3			1
@entity114 , like most of the big cities , was religiously mixed			0
' @entity3 must make decision ' it was n't a utopia -- it was , after all , ruled by @entity224 's iron fist -- but to imagine that life , for decades , was merely a bubbling cauldron of resentment waiting to explode is to do a great disservice to @entity3 society , defining it solely by its divisions , as if the lines of religion or ethnicity could never be surmounted			1
in fact , they were , both individually -- sunnis and @entity76 married each other , as did @entity195 and @entity76 -- and city - wide			0
divisions in @entity3 were , as in most countries of the world , more about economics than race or religion			2
none of that means that partitioning @entity3 should not be considered			2
but it has to come with the understanding that it is @entity3 themselves who must make the decision and that rearranging what were lines in the sand is a serious business , because the new borders will have to be drawn across the bodies of real people			1
it is always easier to speak of division than to speak of good policy			0
but that is what is needed now			0
the colonial - era divisions were a mess			0
but seeking to change them now , at this moment , is a recipe for a generation of war			1
for better or worse , the @entity57 is stuck with the lines drawn by @entity50 .			0

@entity3 's borders were mapped out by the @entity18 and @entity19 colonial powers during @entity274
@entity276 writes that the borders -- though contentious and flawed -- have broadly held
plans for an @entity24 caliphate or dividing @entity3 into statelets are not realistic , he says
seeking to change them now is a recipe for a generation of war , @entity276 writes
