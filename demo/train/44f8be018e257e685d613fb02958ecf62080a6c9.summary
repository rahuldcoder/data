-- in an industry known for elevating a certain look , prizing a certain age and sticking to the script , @entity1 is exceptional			1
at 52 , the 6 - foot - tall comedienne and actress has experienced more success in the last five years of her career than most actors could dream of for their entire life			1
her role as @entity13 on the hit television series " @entity16 " has won her critical praise and accolades including a @entity19 , @entity20 and @entity21			1
likewise , @entity1 's personal life is experiencing its own renaissance			1
in 2010 , she married dr. @entity24 and in doing so became a second mom to daughters @entity27 and @entity28			1
with the ease of a seasoned vet , @entity1 masterfully balances bawdy with heart			1
if you missed her outrageous turn as a lesbian dog trainer in " @entity38 " or lampooning fellow funny lady @entity35 during a @entity37 roast , you might have caught her as the voice of @entity40 in the recent @entity42 movie " @entity41			1
" for her next adventure , @entity1 moves from the screen to the page , hoping to entertain kids of all ages with the new holiday book " @entity49			1
" @entity0 : tell me about " @entity51			1
" @entity1 : oh , it 's great ! it 's an audio book that @entity54 is offering			1
it 's a great reverse @entity55 story where the toymaker wants to become a toy			1
it 's a lot of fun			2
we 're hoping to start a holiday tradition			1
@entity0 : and i hear it 's a family affair ? @entity1 : yes , my daughter @entity27 is on it			1
actually , we all know each other very well , and @entity67 is on it			2
the director is my best friend			2
@entity0 : is it scary or exciting to see your child possibly getting into showbiz ? @entity1 : scary			1
there 's a part of me that had to find my own way			2
i started from kind of an obscure place , and i really wanted it			2
i think that adds to my level of professionalism			2
... but , i just have to have faith in the goodness of my kids , and she 's a great kid			2
i have this thing about me , because i came up from nowhere , that she should too , but you know what , that 's not her path			2
@entity0 : you have come a long way , all the way from @entity96 , @entity97 , to the red carpets of @entity99			2
do you still pinch yourself ? @entity1 : every day ! and it 's a plethora of things			1
i pinch myself every day , and there 's a part of me that 's always like , " wow ! " @entity0 : when you hosted " @entity107 " and went completely nude for that digital short , i remember thinking , " this woman is fearless			2
" was there a moment in your life when you just decided to be completely unapologetic for your creative choices ? @entity1 : oh , absolutely			1
it was when i was doing improv at @entity114			2
you 're doing these sets afterwards , and sometimes it 's like the bigger choice you make , the bigger you fall on your face			2
i think my work started to seem profound when i started making huge choices			0
yes , some of them were too huge , where you lose people and you lose reality , but i think you have to go that far in order to know what you can do -- what 's inside of you			0
@entity0 : i hope someone was recording those big moments			0
@entity1 : i remember playing @entity132 @entity131 in " @entity133 " in @entity135 's @entity134			1
usually , that character is cut because she is so bombastic			0
well , i wanted to keep her in ! so i did and a review came out that said when i was finished , there was no scenery left ! so yeah			0
@entity0 : cleared the room , did you ? @entity1 : exactly			1
@entity0 : @entity13 knows how to clear a room			0
what 's going on over at " @entity16 " these days ? @entity1 : well , we have these new kids , and i 'm absolutely floored by their talent			1
i love the fact that we 're following the gang in @entity152 , you know , @entity154 and the kids			0
the writers have really stepped up			0
it 's a new show this year but with all the same principles			0
it 's all about raising your voice in song and having each other 's back , and i think that 's why it 's resonated so strongly			1
@entity0 : the show 's diverse themes have been a lightning rod for praise and criticism			0
it reminds me of a modern " @entity173			0
" do you ever feel like @entity175 has taken the baton from @entity177 ? @entity1 : you know , i had n't made that connection , but i think that 's really apt. @entity177 was really ahead of his time			1
" @entity173 " was all about progress and was so groundbreaking			0
why did n't things take off from there ? but , i think you 're absolutely right			0
@entity175 is on the line and pushing people			0
we have a transgender character on " @entity16 , " and we 're showing the realism in that -- the struggle with the kids and the parents to accept him			1
ultimately , they do , and they cast him as @entity199 in " grease			0
" and , of course , i ruin it all ! you know , it 's @entity13 's own prejudice , her own fear that someone will be ridiculed , whereas the kids feel strong enough			0
@entity0 : you 've become a role model to millions of people but especially gay women			0
did you set out to champion gay rights ? @entity1 : it 's not something i ever set out to do , but i 'm glad i can			1
i really have to thank all those that came before me			0
people like @entity221 and @entity222			0
there are so many people out there every day working for all of us			0
@entity0 : it sounds like the themes of acceptance and inclusiveness on " glee " really line up with your own personal views			0
@entity1 : oh , very much ! i always wished i had something like " @entity16 " when i was growing up			1
i 'm glad there are kids living out there in not - so - friendly parts of the country who have " glee " to watch			0
they can see that there is hope and that it does get better and that there are people who have your back			0
you just have to find them .			0
