-- gotcha ! that 's how many motorists feel when they see a little bright flash , which they know means an unwelcome fine and points on their license are heading their way			2
motorists are debating whether speed cameras like these make roads safer or just stick people with useless fines			1
but how has the steadily increasing rollout of speed cameras in some 35 cities and more than 300 communities nationwide affected drivers ? do motorists welcome the safety enforcement or think they 've been conned into paying a needless fine ? more importantly , do speed cameras make our roads any safer ? perceptions in the press speeders that make the nightly news are either famous or unusual			1
like @entity26 , 24 , of @entity27 , who was arrested in june in @entity28 , @entity29 , over some 22 speeding tickets issued in her name in just two months on one stretch of @entity33			0
or the @entity35 ' no.1 draft pick , @entity36 who was fined more than $ 1,000 in july for broaching 100 mph on a @entity38 freeway			0
or the @entity40 motorist who gained international notoriety in may due to speed - camera pictures of him -- perhaps unadvisedly -- mooning the camera			1
@entity44 autos : celebrity cars you can afford but the speeding issue , while occasionally titillating , is deadly serious			0
the @entity48 reports that speed is a factor in about a third of all traffic deaths , which total about 13,000 annually			1
speed cameras , as @entity53 points out , were first used in @entity55 in 1986			1
in 2006 , @entity28 , became the first @entity57 location to demonstrate the effectiveness of fixed speed cameras on a major highway , according to the @entity61			1
@entity44 autos : fast , fuel - efficient cars empirical studies @entity64 , spokesman for the @entity65 , which is funded by auto insurers with the mission of researching ways to reduce crashes , says the group is widely in favor of speed cameras			1
he said @entity61 studies , and many similar reports conducted overseas , have proven their effectiveness			0
" what the study found in @entity28 , was that after they began the implementation of the pilot program , which is now a permanent program , the proportion of drivers traveling more than 10 mph over the speed limit dropped by 90 percent , and we found similar a response in @entity85 in @entity86 , [ where it ] declined by 70 percent			1
" @entity44 autos : cars with the most thrill per gallon " it 's human behavior 101 : if drivers believe there 's a high likelihood of getting a ticket , they 're more likely to slow down			0
speeding is a major factor in highway crashes			1
" the flip side common arguments against the cameras suggest that while speed cameras will cut speeds , this can lead to " bunching , " which can result in more accidents if drivers are taken by surprise by others slowing down quickly to avoid a fine			1
anecdotally , this argument sounds convincing			0
empirically , however , the argument is nearly impossible to prove			0
a 2005 review from the @entity61 analyzed data from 14 studies and found crash reductions in the immediate vicinities of camera sites , ranging from 5 to 69 percent for all crashes , 12 to 65 percent for injury crashes , and 17 to 71 percent for fatal crashes			1
@entity44 autos : fast cars over 600 @entity124 @entity125 , formerly of the @entity126 and now head of the @entity129 - based @entity128 , an advocacy group for " fact - based safety policies , " disagrees			0
" there 's a direct correlation between congestion and flow factors and accidents , " he said			2
" [ the ] biggest problems are where backups occur			0
cameras destroy the flow of the road			2
any time a driver hits the brake , and the one after him , you completely destroy the flow and capacity of the road			0
" he said that most speed cameras are catching drivers driving fast at night , which is the safest time of the day to drive since here is less traffic and roads frequently are clear			1
@entity125 cited @entity155 autobahns as an example of safe , uniform , free - flowing traffic			2
" everybody is worried about speed cameras and how they are used , " he said			1
" none of it has anything to do with safety			0
bottom line is : it 's all about money			0
" enforcement as well as raising revenue , a speed - camera system can free up officers from patrol duties to concentrate on other beats ( which leads to criticism that police may be less inclined to patrol a section of road with a camera , leading to fewer arrests of drunken or reckless drivers )			2
@entity44 autos : 10 hot , small cars of course , the volume of fines usually has to pay court fees and cover the installation of the expensive network and its upkeep			0
where camera systems are illegal in @entity190 , photographic speed camera systems are illegal			1
this year , the city of @entity192 was ordered to abandon its system as it relied on an image of the driver , which is proscribed by state law as a result of privacy concerns , leaving the city to settle millions of dollars of fines it handed out			2
photo imaging is also illegal in @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206 , @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and @entity210			2
red - light cameras at junctions are generally permitted in these states			2
this ban is under threat in @entity190 , according to watchdog site @entity216 , which says an @entity227 state senator 's bill introduced in february " will remove from @entity218 the requirement that an automated enforcement device be at an intersection , and that will allow the devices to be put on freeways			1
that change is accomplished by the repositioning of a 7 - word phrase in @entity218 ( a ) ( 2 )			0
" that bill is still making its way through the state legislature			0
concerns over speed cameras extend to more privacy issues than just photos			1
a recent @entity239 story detailed the fact that many convicted for speeding in @entity242 had complained about their @entity244 records appearing online alongside their driver 's license number and citation record			0
the records have since been removed			0
driver perceptions the @entity40 - based @entity250 reports that a perception among motorists of unfair camera policy can seriously damage relations between drivers and police			0
but @entity61 spokesman @entity64 said perceptions in the @entity57 are surprisingly positive			0
" in the @entity57 the assumption is that people do n't like speed cameras			1
but we found in our surveys that , in @entity86 , 51 percent of drivers favored [ speed cameras ] and 36 percent apposed them , " he noted			1
" in @entity85 , 62 percent supported them			2
in @entity28 , 63 percent said they were in favor			2
after the operation began , 77 percent of drivers supported their use			2
drivers support programs that make the road safer			0
" for better or worse ? speed cameras remain a contentious issue across the @entity57 and internationally , where debate still rages in the @entity40 and @entity279			1
one thing is clear : legislatures and city governments are increasingly expressing interest in speed cameras , seeing them as both increasing safety and revenue in a time when many are facing budgetary holes			1
and while the general motoring public can probably see both sides of the issue , it may be merely that the system is perceived as being inaccurate or unfair that leads to such fractious debate ... rather than the actual system itself being unfair .			0

speed is a factor in a third of all traffic deaths , national highway administration says
study finds cameras reduce speeders by more than 70 percent in some areas
expert says cameras lead to " bunching , " which increases accidents
photographic speed cameras are illegal in @entity190 for privacy reasons
