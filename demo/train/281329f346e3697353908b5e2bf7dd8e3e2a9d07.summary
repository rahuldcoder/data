@entity0 , @entity1 -- as the chairwoman of @entity1 's @entity4 , @entity5 , faces business challenges few other executives can imagine			1
the former housewife took over the company in 2003 after the death of her husband , who faced allegations he transferred millions to @entity13 to help arrange the historic 2000 summit			1
in addition to managing massive operations in finance , manufacturing , and transport , she oversees operations in the secretive state of @entity13			1
subsidiary @entity22 has led efforts to build economic ties between the @entity25 , so @entity5 is not only managing a multinational through a recession but also through global tensions over the @entity30 's nuclear program			1
@entity22 has invested $ 272 million in @entity13 , in projects like the @entity32 and tours to @entity34			1
@entity5 traveled to @entity13 in august to secure the release of a @entity4 worker who was detained on accusations he insulted the government			1
while there , she spent more than four hours with the state 's reclusive leader - @entity40 -- who was said to be recovering from a possible stroke			2
as part of @entity2 's @entity45 , @entity43 sat down with @entity5 at @entity4 's @entity46 in @entity0			1
here are edited excerpts from the conversation			0
@entity2 : what was your impression of @entity40 as a man ? does he look healthy ? was he mentally very aware ? @entity5 : when i first saw him i thought he had lost a lot of weight than before , but once we started talking , his voice was strong and he talked a lot about things that had happened in the past			1
he talked about my father - in - law [ @entity4 founder @entity64 ] , my husband and a lot of things from the past , and it seemed like he still had a good memory and had no issues with carrying out his work			1
he seemed to be in good health			2
when you were talking with @entity40 , was it your impression that he wants more investment from @entity1 ? that he wants to do more business with your country ? he showed a lot of enthusiasm			2
he said he hopes the @entity30 and @entity1 government can talk things through so to have a lot of @entity1 companies enter the @entity30 , and he also said that since they have the natural resources and the @entity1 has the skills to sell , if both sides work together he expects the @entity25 to prosper			0
is @entity40 a tough business negotiator ? he seems to be very honest and straightforward when he speaks			0
so i believe that if direct talks with the leader @entity40 are possible , a lot of good results will come out of it			1
i personally think that if president @entity97 and @entity40 meet , things can be worked out quite easily			0
the @entity32 industrial complex , the joint facility run by @entity25 , what is the future of that complex ? currently we are only operating the first block , but i am sure that once things get settled down by both governments , we have many plans for the second block as well			2
a hotel needs to be built			0
we need to have hospitals , post offices , so i am expecting gradually that we will expand business there			0
what is it like to manage them ? do they have the skills ? do they understand the technology ? @entity13 employees work very hard , and i heard that women work especially hard , so all the factories want to take in the female workers			2
in the beginning , because the workers had n't used things like sewing machines before , i heard they would come to work an hour early to practice and that they work with great enthusiasm and work very hard			0
@entity13 workers are also good at holding small meetings and they talk things through during those meetings			1
so the factory owners seem to be very pleased with it all			0
when you have a factory in @entity142 , if there 's a problem it 's hard to fix it because of the language , but in this case , since you can communicate freely , the employers find it much easier to do things			0
why invest so much in @entity13 ? what is the upside for @entity4 ? it all started with the project of my father - in - law			1
because he was born in @entity13 he always had a great love towards @entity13			2
he met some of his relatives there			0
i think personally , he was saddened by the economic poverty that people were experiencing in that country			0
so this is n't a business mission , it is a personal mission ? i think for my father - in - law , a lot of it was started for personal reasons			0
for me , of course i do it for business , but also because my husband experienced bad things due to operations in @entity13 , i feel like it 's my duty to continue this business to ensure his death does not go to waste			2
is the @entity1 government supportive of @entity4 groups operations and interests in @entity13 ? not really at the moment because of the nuclear issue at the middle			1
things are not going that smoothly at the moment			0
but we are hoping in the future that they will help and cooperate and be supportive and i guess they will .			0
