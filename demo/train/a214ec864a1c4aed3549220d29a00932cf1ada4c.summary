-- @entity3 , who worked as a globetrotting foreign correspondent during the flush decades of network news , has died at age 74 of prostate cancer , his wife of 40 years said friday			1
" he has been fighting -- as you always call it -- prostate cancer for two years , " @entity8 said			2
" he had a very , very rare , very aggressive kind			2
" he died thursday night at his home in @entity15 overlooking @entity16 , she said			2
" he was really the old kind of journalist , " she said of her husband , who reported from more than 75 countries			1
" he was the old kind of trenchcoat - clad journalist who wrote his own copy -- always wrote his own copy			1
" during his early years at @entity25 , the network did not scrimp on devoting resources to newsgathering , she said			1
" that 's what he always talked about : the early days were the lucky days			2
" born in @entity31 in 1939 to a radio and television news couple , @entity35 and @entity36 , @entity3 graduated from @entity37 and studied at the @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , before winning a @entity41 and moving to @entity42 to study @entity44 relations , she said			1
in 1963 , @entity25 's @entity45 -- who had worked for @entity3 's father -- hired him as an office assistant in the network 's bureau in @entity50 , @entity51 , she said			1
after @entity54 's " @entity53 " expanded that year from 15 minutes to half an hour , the network was looking for more material , and @entity3 caught the eye of the brass			1
" he covered a couple of stories for the @entity64 , as it was called then , " she said of what is now the @entity59 , and did some work in @entity61			2
" but mainly , within the year , there was this little war going on , and they did n't have a journalist there			2
so @entity3 started the @entity25 office in @entity71			1
" when he arrived in @entity73 , the newsman was the bureau 's sole occupant			1
by the time he left a few years later to report from capitals around the world , 20 people were staffing it , @entity8 said			2
he went on to serve as bureau chief in @entity42 from 1966 - 68 and then in @entity80 , where he met his wife in 1971			1
from 1973 - 79 , he was chief foreign correspondent for @entity82 and the @entity83			2
but he returned several times to @entity71 for such key events as the @entity86 and the pullout of @entity89 troops in 1973			1
they were heady days for foreign correspondents			0
it was not unusual for @entity25 to send @entity8 for three weeks to report a story in @entity94 or for two weeks to cover a story in @entity96 , his wife said			1
" it was still the journalism where you actually had to have the knowledge and explain a situation			0
" @entity8 prepared to be a man of the world , becoming fluent in @entity103 and @entity104 and developing a working knowledge of @entity107 and @entity108 , she said			0
he was a ubiquitous presence on the network , serving as a weekend anchor of " @entity112 " and a moderator of " @entity114 , " in addition to his work as a correspondent			0
but over the years , the network cut its newsgathering resources , she said			0
" today , journalism is somebody telling you what you see behind them , " she said			0
" @entity3 still gave the background of the political situation and why it is that way			1
i 'm sorry , this is a proud widow talking			2
" after @entity133 bought @entity25 in 1986 , " he really witnessed the decline , " and @entity8 went briefly to @entity134 as its chief foreign correspondent , but left after it was bought by @entity136 in 1996 , when its news division endured similar cuts			1
in 1997 , he moved to @entity0 as a contributor			0
" and what a presence he was , " @entity0 editorial director @entity141 said in an e-mail to colleagues on friday			0
" in his calm , measured , voice anchoring on 9/11 and in countless pieces , @entity3 delivered thoughtful analysis that always raised the bar			1
" @entity3 was the consummate gentleman in every encounter			1
he was relentlessly curious , passionate about storytelling , and unafraid to take on the controversial topics			0
" those here in those days learned so much from @entity3			1
... he left a mark			0
we can all hope to do the same			0
" but the network did not embrace @entity3 's tone , his widow said			1
" he actually was reprimanded for it : ' @entity3 , why do you have to be so serious ? ' " he carried a serious demeanor throughout his life , said his sister - in - law @entity164 , a @entity31 journalist who is married to @entity3 's brother @entity165			1
" he was always kind of the grownup in the room , even when he as much younger , " she said			2
" i really think he had a kind of dignity			2
we saw it in his death , and we knew it in his life			0
" when he left @entity0 in 2002 , @entity3 's farewell note cited advice he had received more than four decades before from @entity45			1
" keep your voice low and your sentences short			0
" " i am not sure how much of a place there is for low , quiet voices in our chosen field today , but brevity is still a virtue , " @entity3 wrote			1
" for a journalist , there are few joys greater than the opportunity to craft and contribute reports on subjects ranging from the weighty , to the ephemera of a changing culture			2
@entity0 has offered me the opportunity to do so , and for that i am grateful			0
i will continue in various guises			0
" i could go on , but i wo n't			0
" @entity3 's producer at @entity0 recalled him as a mentor			1
" he was a journalistic giant , who took me under his wing as a researcher and producer when i first started with @entity0 , " @entity200 said in a @entity202 posting			0
" @entity3 taught me how to write for television and helped me develop an eye for pictures ... my fondest memories are chats we had in his office late in the day			1
i would pick his brain about his long , storied career			2
" @entity200 noted @entity3 's love for his wife , who called him " @entity219 , " and for the opera broadcasts he hosted for @entity221 , but he said it was something else that most impressed him			1
" @entity3 loved to laugh , and that 's what i will miss most			1
sometimes he would laugh so long and hard and start shaking			0
it was just the funniest thing in the world			0
i will miss that man			0
such a tremendous loss today for journalism and for me personally			0
rest in peace , @entity219			0
" after departing @entity0 , @entity3 went into academia , helping create the @entity234 at the @entity235 and serving as professor of broadcasting and journalism at @entity239			1
during his career , he received a number of honors , including an @entity243 and a @entity244			2
he also served on the boards of the @entity246 , @entity37 and @entity247 , the board of advisers of @entity249 and as chairman of the @entity251 on @entity103			0
the couple had no children			0
" i always thought it was because @entity3 traveled so much , " @entity8 said			1
but they were " blessed with " several godchildren and found happiness in other ways , she said			0
" if you never become parents , you remain lovers , " she said			0
@entity3 's 2000 memoir , " you should have been here yesterday : a @entity270 in @entity271 , " was described by the @entity264 as " a moving account of @entity3 's experiences in the business " and a history of television news			1
" he openly acknowledges his frustrations at both the limitations of reporting and television 's corporate parents ' squeezing of foreign news in the name of profits , " it says			2
" still , he chooses to see the positive			0
and while he regrets the decline of traditional foreign news reporting , he remains optimistic about new media taking up the slack , writing that all the new sources will offer ' more in both breadth and depth			0
that is what makes the future in electronic and digital journalism so exciting			0
' " " he was a big , big guy , " @entity25 's @entity294 said on friday 's " today " of the 6 - foot - 6 - inch man			1
" he was an imposing figure physically , but also intellectually			0
he was a smart man			0
