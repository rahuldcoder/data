-- world no. 1 @entity1 is looking to win her first grand slam crown			1
@entity4 , one of her predecessors as the top women 's tennis player , is returning to the scene of her breakthrough title			1
both players are adamant that their biggest obstacles to success at @entity13 this year will be the @entity14 sisters @entity14 and @entity16			1
the @entity17 are back on the scene after varying but significant absences			2
@entity14 , a four - time champion at the @entity22 grass - court grand slam , is playing just her second tournament since winning last year 's final -- her second triumph in a row in south - west @entity26			1
can @entity14 succeed in her comeback bid ? the 29 - year - old has spent the past 12 months recovering from a freak foot injury , cutting it in a restaurant and then facing a near - death situation as blood clots formed in both lungs			2
her return at @entity36 last week ended in a second - round loss to @entity38 , who avenged her 2010 @entity13 final defeat			2
@entity16 , a five - time @entity13 champion , reached the quarterfinals in her first tournament since retiring hurt with a hip injury at january 's @entity43			1
both sisters are predictably rusty , but are still among the bookmakers ' favorites to reach the final on july 2 along with @entity4 , @entity49 champion @entity48 and -- further down the list -- @entity1			1
@entity4 , who stunned @entity14 as a 17 - year - old in the 2004 final , is wary of the @entity14 ' vast experience at the tournament			1
" they 've been champions here for many years			0
they 're obviously the ones to beat on grass , " the @entity56 told reporters ahead of her bid to win a fourth grand slam title			1
" they 've been out for a while so it 's definitely great to have them back			0
" @entity14 ' back from death bed ' fifth seed @entity4 could meet @entity14 -- who is no. 7 despite her slip in the rankings -- again in the semifinals , though she may have to beat @entity1 to get that far			1
the 20 - year - old @entity71 is a former junior @entity13 champion but has never made it past the fourth round in the senior ranks			2
" we all know that the game of the girls is perfectly suited for the grass			0
it 's good that they got a higher seeding than their rankings because no - one wants to play them in the early rounds , " @entity1 said of the @entity14 duo			1
" i 'm very happy that @entity14 's doing well again			2
i do n't wish for anyone to be in that situation because it 's scary			0
@entity14 and @entity16 are great girls , i have a good relationship with them			0
" @entity1 begins her campaign against @entity96 's 107th - ranked @entity95 , who has never made it past the second round at @entity13			1
" i 've had a good year and won five tournaments so far			0
i know i can play really well on grass			0
i 've won @entity36 before , i won the junior title			0
i know that i can play really good tennis			0
" @entity4 will open against compatriot @entity103 , once ranked as high as fifth in the world after reaching the semifinals of the 2007 @entity106 but now 50th as she seeks to rebuild her career			2
" i 'm playing a lot better			0
i played a lot of matches on clay , which i really wanted to do			0
one of the reasons i love the transition is because i feel like you learn so much about the game when you 're on the clay courts , " said this month 's @entity49 semifinalist			0
" this is one of the best parts of the year for me			0
it 's one of the toughest transitions from clay to grass , but for me it 's a lot of fun			0
" seventh seed @entity14 has been handed a potentially tricky tie against @entity128 of @entity129 , while 23rd seed @entity16 faces @entity131 of @entity132 in the other half of the draw			1
meanwhile , @entity135 boosted her hopes of a repeat of her 2007 @entity13 exploits by winning her first grass - court title at @entity36 on saturday			1
the @entity129 world no. 9 , beaten by @entity141 in the final that year , defied an potentially worrying leg injury in cool , windy conditions to beat @entity146 fifth seed @entity147 6 - 1 4 - 6 7 - 5			1
due to friday 's washout , they both played two matches as @entity135 beat @entity152 seventh seed @entity153 6 - 3 6 - 1 and @entity147 went through when @entity155 's @entity154 retired with a stomach injury while trailing 7 - 6 ( 11 - 9 ) 4 - 2			2
in the men 's final , @entity158 's @entity157 earned his first @entity162 title as @entity164 third seed @entity163 retired hurt in fading light while trailing 6 - 7 ( 5 - 7 ) 6 - 3 3 - 5			0
@entity163 , the world no. 30 , is in doubt for @entity13 after injuring his groin , the @entity167 @entity166 reported			1
at the @entity173 warm - up event in @entity174 , @entity158 seventh seed @entity171 claimed her fifth @entity176 title and first on grass by beating former world no. 4 @entity178 , 6 - 7 ( 7 - 9 ) 6 - 3 7 - 5 in saturday 's final			1
now ranked 59th , @entity178 will play @entity49 runner - up @entity180 in the first round at @entity13 , where she reached the semifinals in 2000 , while @entity171 takes on @entity56 's @entity184			2
in the men 's final , @entity56 's @entity185 beat @entity188 fourth seed @entity189 6 - 3 6 - 2 to claim his first title since @entity36 last year .			0

@entity14 and @entity141 are the players their *female* rivals hope to avoid at @entity13
@entity17 sisters have won the grass - court grand slam nine times between them
world no. 1 @entity1 is drawn to potentially meet @entity14 in semifinals
@entity4 , the 2004 champion , is in the same half of the women 's draw
