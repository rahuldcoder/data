-- @entity2 side @entity1 are pondering proposing a ground share with city rivals @entity4 following the rejection of plans for their own 50,000 stadium			1
@entity1 had proposed the new $ 660 million combined stadium and shopping complex for @entity10 , located north - east of the city , but were rejected by the local council			1
chief executive @entity13 admits the club could be interested in teaming up with their city neighbours at @entity16 , the planned location for @entity4 's new 61,000 stadium			1
" we are going to look forward and look forward positively , " @entity19 told the @entity20			0
" a shared stadium is perhaps an option if it 's affordable			0
" @entity1 are keen to take advantage of the increased revenue a bigger stadium would bring over their current 40,000 - capacity @entity28 ground			1
with their @entity10 proposal , which was to be co-funded by @entity33 supermarket chain @entity32 , looking unlikely to get the go - ahead a ground share with @entity4 would seem an obvious solution especially with the @entity36 struggling to raise the necessary money to get the development going			2
" we have to look at where we can raise money , because potentially @entity4 will have to obviously contribute to that , and @entity43 perhaps might need to find some money , " added @entity19			0
" we 're going to have to start to have those conversations ; we 're not going to have to be open - minded about solutions			0
" @entity4 's @entity48 owners @entity49 and @entity50 however have previously said they were opposed to such plans as they did not want to lose out on the revenue streams which come from sole ownership			1
the @entity56 club 's position seems unlikely to change , at least in the short term , with their deputy executive director @entity58 telling @entity59 : " it 's not on our agenda at the moment			0
@entity4 are progressing forward with our own stadium			2
that is the position we are still in			0
" the rejection of the @entity10 stadium proposal is a major blow to @entity1 's future plans with the club hoping the development would have encouraged much needed investment			1
" that was the big attraction to @entity10 , that it was affordable , " added @entity19			0
" then it 's about reviewing alternatives and sitting down with partners , all the stakeholders in this region and anybody who can help @entity1 deliver what it needs -- which is a world - class stadium that 's going to secure our future for years to come			2

@entity1 are considering *enquiring* with city - rivals @entity4 about a possible ground - share
this follows the rejection of plans for their own new stadium by local council *officials*
@entity4 's owners have previously said they would not be keen on sharing with @entity1
