-- as the family of a late @entity4 linebacker pursues a lawsuit against his former employer , claiming that effects of multiple concussions caused @entity9 to kill his girlfriend and himself , we are left to consider a larger legal question : how liable can a negligent employer be for a suicide ? @entity14 , the @entity15 social psychologist of the early 20th century , observed : " each victim of suicide gives his act a personal stamp which expresses his temperament , the special conditions in which he is involved , and which , consequently , can not be explained by the social and general causes of the phenomenon			1
" culturally , we have long - viewed suicide as the most personal of decisions			1
the law has mostly followed suit			1
legally , suicide is like murder in that it 's a specific - intent killing			1
there are many degrees of intent in criminal law , and specific intent is the highest level			1
it means the killer acted intending the specific outcome -- the death of the victim			0
the only practical difference is the inherent complication in prosecuting the completed suicide			1
your defendant is also your victim , and in any event , he is no longer subject to the state 's jurisdiction			0
so then how can we suggest that @entity9 's employer negligently caused him to do the most independent , intentional act of all ? the legal question is better framed like this : negligent parties are generally liable for all the harm that is foreseeably caused by their negligence			1
when a person is negligent , it means they undertook some activity , and their conduct fell below a standard of care in performing that activity			0
sometimes , however , a defendant can act negligently , but the subsequent harm to another person is caused by a completely independent intervening cause			1
this will break the original chain of causation , absolving the defendant of liability			0
suppose , for example , the @entity4 were found to be negligent as to @entity9			1
( the team has n't commented on the lawsuit			2
) @entity9 's body exhumed for brain study suppose the plaintiff proves all their allegations and then some : imagine an e-mail surfacing where the team president knowingly and mockingly writes after reviewing medical evidence of concussions : " time for some concussions in @entity90 ! " to which another executive , aware of the potential harm to players , writes : " is it wrong that i 'm smiling ? " of course , no such evidence is known to exist			1
but suppose @entity9 's family can also show that he suffered concussions and emotional problems as a direct result of the ( fictional ) team officials ' negligence			1
but then imagine that @entity9 's death was actually caused by an errant bolt of lightning in the parking lot			1
that bolt of lightning -- an " act of @entity110 " -- would be considered something unexpected that was wholly unrelated to his employer 's negligence			0
none of us would expect the @entity4 to be liable for @entity9 's death by electrocution in this hypothetical			1
so what about the alleged murder committed by @entity9 ? could the @entity4 be liable ? traditionally , an unforeseeable , willful criminal act that intervenes between the negligent act and an intentional killing breaks the causal connection			1
similarly , courts traditionally held that suicide was an " independent intervening cause , " so that there was no liability for negligence that resulted in a suicide			1
but the times are changing			0
the recent trend is to permit these cases if the plaintiff can " prove " that the negligence caused the suicide			1
this development appears completely inconsistent with centuries of jurisprudence			0
but it may be very consistent with the current direction of our culture : holding others responsible for our own behavior			2
in @entity150 , a wrongful death plaintiff has the burden to show that the decedent 's death was " a direct result " of a defendant 's negligence			0
more specifically , if the plaintiff can show that the death was the " natural and probable consequence " of the injury that the defendant caused by his negligence , then the plaintiff can win			2
now , this is no easy case to make and likely would require expert medical evidence to draw a scientific relationship between one man 's carelessness and another 's suicide			2
fortunately for the @entity9 family and plaintiffs at large , @entity150 courts acknowledge that the science , like the law , is increasingly on their team			1
according to @entity150 courts , modern psychiatry supports the idea that suicide sometimes is a foreseeable result of traumatic injuries			2
and if a qualified expert takes the stand and tells a jury that , to a reasonable degree of medical certainty , a concussion directly caused a suicide , well that jury has something on which to hang a verdict			1
we should n't be shocked			0
after all , as a society we 've been tinkering with holding people responsible for another 's suicide for some time now			1
in @entity199 in 2012 , @entity198 student @entity196 was convicted of invasion of privacy and more than a dozen other charges by using a webcam to peek ( into his own room , that he would have had an absolute right to walk into at any time ) at his roommate @entity208			0
when @entity210 learned of the immature and cruel prank , he was upset			0
in gauging @entity213 's responsibility , we should have considered the " natural and probable consequence " of @entity213 's juvenile acts on @entity210			2
we should have asked : what would we have expected @entity210 to do in this instance ? perhaps we 'd expect him to sucker - punch @entity213			0
maybe we 'd expect @entity210 to fling @entity213 's laptop out of their dorm window			0
but can any of us say the " natural and probable " consequence of @entity213 's stunt was @entity210 's suicide ? the clever reader will point out that @entity213 was not prosecuted for the death of @entity210 , and that is true			2
but let 's face it : the main reason @entity213 was in criminal court was because @entity210 committed suicide			2
@entity213 was prosecuted because of the independent act of a very upset young man			0
( @entity210 's family decided not to file a lawsuit and instead to focus on working with the @entity238 to support gay and lesbian youths			2
) we 're entering a new cultural era			0
now , when a tragedy occurs , heads must roll , no matter what			0
now that appears to include suicide , that most personal , independent decision to end one 's own life			2
our mind may tell us that the deceased is the only party liable for his suicide			2
our grief , however , speaks louder , and it calls out for retribution			0
modern jurisprudence appears to join in the public sentiment ; we are moving toward the idea that for every tragedy , every social wrong , every inequity , that someone must be held responsible			0
perhaps it 's socially cathartic , or perhaps we are devolving to our bloodier @entity265 days , where we are sated as long as a lion eats someone			0
even though it goes against centuries of legal precedent , cases such as @entity213 's and other civil cases are suggesting a cultural sea change			0
when someone commits suicide , it 's someone else 's fault			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity280 .			1

family of @entity9 sues team , says concussions led him to kill girlfriend and himself
@entity280 : traditionally , law has *declined* to hold others responsible for a suicide
suicide and murder are acts that might be caused by many different things , he says
@entity280 : @entity297 and the law are beginning to accept others can be blamed for suicide
