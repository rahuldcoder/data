when i was at @entity2 or @entity3 , my public affairs staff would sometimes enlist me to intervene with an editor to stop the publication of what we viewed to be classified information			1
i would invariably begin the conversation with the journalist by pointing out that i knew that , " we both have a job to do protect @entity14 security and liberty , but how you 're about to do yours is going to make it harder for me to do mine			1
" that introduction reflected my true feelings , so — like most @entity14 — i am conflicted about the current row over protecting press freedom and protecting national secrets			1
the two prominent cases being debated were indeed serious leaks , because they touched upon sources , not just information			1
in the case of the @entity32 report on a @entity34 - based bomb plot , the source had apparently penetrated an @entity36 network and there were hopes that he could continue to be exploited			1
in the @entity42 report on @entity44 's intention to test a nuclear weapon , @entity40 told us not just that the @entity14 judged that @entity47 would respond to impending sanctions with a test			1
he pointedly added that a source in @entity44 had told us so			1
these kinds of stories get people killed			1
while at @entity2 i recounted to a group of news bureau chiefs that , when an agency presence in a denied area had been revealed in the media , two assets had been detained and executed			2
the @entity2 site there wrote : " regret that we can not address this loss of life with the person who decided to leak our mission to the newspapers			2
" and , since the @entity34 source appears to have actually been recruited by a liaison partner , the impact of a leak goes far beyond our own service			2
in that same talk with bureau chiefs , i pointed out that several years before 9/11 , one chief of station reported that a press leak of liaison intelligence had " put us out of the ( @entity78 ) bin laden reporting business "			1
in both stories , investigations were in order			2
journalists , of all people , should understand the need to protect sources and relationships			1
but the investigations have been very aggressive and the acquisition of journalists ' communications records has been broad , invasive , secret and — one suspects — unnecessary			2
a quick survey of former @entity96 administration colleagues confirmed my belief that a proposal to sweep up a trove of @entity32 phone records or @entity40 's e-mails would have had a half - life of about 30 seconds in that administration			1
and , although @entity40 seems to have worked his source with tradecraft and elicitation techniques more reminiscent of a case officer than a press conference , charges of co-conspiracy and flight risk are quite a stretch			2
if this had been a @entity116 strike rather than an investigation , we would have judged the target ( leaks and leakers ) to have been legitimate , but the collateral damage ( squeezing the @entity122 and chilling legitimate press activity ) to have been prohibitive			1
which brings me back to being conflicted and to a sense of resignation that this legitimate free press - legitimate government secrets thing is a condition we will have to manage , not a problem that we will solve			1
when the press decides to publish something that the government considers classified , it is assuming for itself an inherently governmental function			2
and as @entity137 once pointed out , " we journalists usually try to argue that we have carefully weighed the pros and cons and believe that the public benefit of disclosure outweighs any potential harm			2
the problem is that we are n't fully qualified to make those judgments			2
" true enough , but no one who has served in government would claim that the public release of every document marked with a classification stamp would actually harm @entity14 security			0
government confuses things further with controlled releases of formerly classified data for both policy and political reasons			0
so many anonymous government officials have commented on drones and targeted killings in recent years that i told a @entity164 committee last summer that i simply did not know what of my personal knowledge of those programs i could or could not publicly discuss			0
if there exists a body of information that can fairly be labeled " publicly known but still officially classified , " the protection of truly secret data will be eroded			0
when lines are not bright , it is more likely that even well intentioned people will end up on the wrong side of them			0
the problem promises to get harder , not easier			0
while at @entity2 i asked my civilian advisory board to consider whether @entity14 would be able to conduct espionage in the future within a political culture that seemed to every day demand more transparency and more public accountability from every aspect of national life			0
beyond this cultural trend , modern technology arms inquisitive journalists with powerful tools to gather and link disparate data , to turn what were once globally dispersed shards of glass into revealing mosaics			0
many things intended to be secret , like the airlift of @entity199 weapons to @entity200 , simply do n't stay that way			0
so , how do we limit the damage ? well , journalists will have to expand the kind of sensitivities to the national welfare that some already show			0
in those calls i made to slow , scotch or amend a pending story , most on the other end of the line were open to reasonable arguments			0
in one case a writer willingly changed a reference that had read " based on intercepts " to " based on intelligence reports , " somewhat amazed that that change made much of a difference			1
) the government may also want to adjust its approach to enforcement			0
the current tsunami of leak prosecutions is based largely on the @entity228 , a blunt @entity230 statute designed to punish aiding the enemy			0
it 's sometimes a tough fit			1
the leak case against former @entity3 employee @entity234 collapsed of its own overreach in 2011			0
perhaps in many of these cases the best approach is not through the courts or the @entity240			0
intelligence agency heads should be urged to make fuller use of their administrative authorities to suspend or dismiss employees or to lift clearances — actions with a lower threshold than criminal prosecutions but whose promptness , frequency and certainty could still deter many unauthorized disclosures			1
finally , we should ( belatedly ) admit that there is some common ground here			0
intelligence agencies often act on the edges of executive prerogative and move forward based on a narrow base of lawfulness and limited congressional notification — and these are often sufficient to underpin a one - off covert action			1
but democracies do n't get to do anything repeatedly over a long period ( like drone strikes and targeted killings ) without political support — and political support is the end point of a process that begins with informed debate			0
informed debate depends on information , the kind that most journalists seek			0
we can not make public the nation 's legitimate secrets , but @entity14 need a broad outline of what is being done on their behalf			1
ironically , the public dialogue generated by a free press may be one of the best guarantors that the @entity285 will , in the future , be able to act boldly ( and occasionally secretly ) in its own defense .			0

*ex-cia* *director* @entity288 says the @entity32 , @entity42 leaks were serious , and related to sources of intelligence
he says even though leaks were damaging , @entity294 administration went too far in its probes
he says there 's a need to *balance* protecting secrets against @entity302
