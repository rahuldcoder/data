@entity0 -- from earthly orbit to the deepest reaches of the @entity5 , @entity2 has notched up two more firsts for the country 's ambitious sea and space exploration programs			1
on sunday , the three @entity2 astronauts on board the @entity10 - 9 manually docked their spacecraft to the @entity14 1 , an orbiting space lab. on the same day , a @entity2 manned submersible vehicle set a deep - diving record when it descended 7,020 meters into the @entity18 in the @entity5			1
the three men on board the sub -- dubbed oceanauts in @entity2 -- sent greetings to the three astronauts on the @entity26 spacecraft			1
" we wish for a great success of the manual docking and brilliant achievements in @entity2 's manned space and manned deep - sea dive causes , " @entity27 quoted @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 as saying			1
@entity2 sends first woman into space both endeavors have been a source of pride for @entity2 and could help bolster support for the @entity42 as it undergoes a once - in - a - decade leadership transition later this year and handles the fall - out from the demise of former politician @entity46			1
" scientific achievements like this allow the party to again remind the population of what has been achieved under their leadership , " said @entity47 , a research follow at @entity49 in @entity50			0
" it buys credibility and justification for their continued rule , even as scandals like @entity46 eat away at their authority			0
" i would expect additional such displays in the coming months , especially if reports of a troubled succession are correct			0
" mastering the technique of joining spacecraft together manually is also seen as an essential step toward @entity2 's goal of building a space station in 2020			1
until now , the docking had been done by remote control from the ground			0
local media reported that @entity2 also plans to start building a deep - sea station to accompany its march into space			1
the three - man sub @entity80 , named after a mythical sea dragon , worked for three hours on the sea floor , collecting water samples , sediments and placing markers at the bottom of the sea			2
@entity27 said the 11 - hour dive " enabled @entity2 to join the ranks of deep - sea faring countries " like the @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 and @entity94			1
@entity47 said that the ability to undertake such deep - sea dives also had commercial applications and would help @entity2 drill for oil and undertake deep - sea mining			1
will @entity2 overtake @entity91 in space ? @entity2 has been funding oceanographic research for more than a decade after it was added to the country 's 9th five year plan in 1996 , he added			0
meanwhile , a spokeswoman for @entity2 's manned space missions said the program , which began in 1992 , would cost a total of almost 40 billion yuan ( us $ 6.27 billion )			2
" these programs are emblematic of sustained @entity2 investments in the human capital and infrastructure of science , " said @entity47			0
" this should be a warning call to the @entity91 and @entity117 that their traditional dominance in science is in jeopardy			0
" but some @entity2 internet users , while lauding the achievements , questioned whether these exploits were the wisest use of @entity2 's new - found wealth			2
" diving into the sea and flying out to space			0
@entity2 now can do them both , " said one user of the @entity131 - like portal @entity130			2
" it marks the development of technology and we are proud of it			0
but can the government care more about its people 's well - being too ? " @entity138 in @entity0 contributed to this report			0

@entity2 spacecraft makes first manual docking
on same day , deep - sea dive record is set by manned sub
both feats seen as source of pride for @entity2 as leaders seek to bolster support
