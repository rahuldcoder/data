sometimes it takes a disaster to inspire innovation			0
there is a major drought in @entity5			1
it 's not the first state to face a water shortage recently , and it 's definitely not the first time @entity5 has had to battle drought , but it could drag on for a decade and have a significant impact on all @entity12 who rely on @entity5 farms for food			1
residents , the government and the agriculture industry are hoping for some high - tech solutions for a very old problem			1
surprisingly , given its @entity5 location , @entity19 is n't a hotbed of drought and water research			1
most local investors and venture capitalists are n't looking to invest in something that will take at least 10 years to pay off			0
they want software , cheap - to - make mobile apps that gather and monetize data about people , and consumer goods like phones , smart watches and futuristic thermostats			0
" water does n't always fit the venture capital model , " said @entity35 , coo of @entity36 , a @entity37 nonprofit focused on helping water - technology companies get their ideas off the ground			1
as the @entity44 observes @entity45 on saturday , it 's fitting that the biggest water research and innovation hubs are scattered around the globe			1
@entity49 , @entity50 , the @entity51 and @entity52 are global leaders in the industry out of geographic necessity			0
in the @entity12 , there are water - research centers clustered in @entity58 and @entity59 in @entity5 , and in @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			1
in @entity63 , the roots of the water industry go back 100 years and are tied to the city 's big breweries			1
now there are 150 water - tech companies in the region , and five of the 11 largest companies in the world either have their headquarters or a major operation there			1
green roofs and tree trays @entity79 runs @entity80 , which has created the @entity81 , a @entity63 complex with almost 100,000 square feet of research space , labs , offices and conference rooms			0
researchers and entrepreneurs come together to collaborate on water - technology issues			1
the space houses intriguing startups such as @entity92 , which builds " green " roofs that help collect storm water			1
there also are products that help detect leaks , waste - water treatment research , and tools for better tracking water usage and waste			1
agriculture accounts for 70 % of all our water usage , so much of the current technology focuses on helping farms use water more efficiently			1
solutions range from the high - tech , like using big data and infrared aerial monitoring to give farmers more precise water information , to the simpler but ingenious , such as specialized plastic trays that fit around the bases of young trees			1
imagine @entity118 's latest class has a crop of promising agriculture technology companies			2
@entity121 wants to be the @entity122 of agriculture			2
the @entity125 - based company was founded by a former @entity127 employee and a former @entity129 employee			0
they 're using their experience working with big data sets to scrape together all the available information that might be useful to water and wastewater systems in @entity136			2
getting better information is also what inspired the two founders of @entity140			0
they have invented a monitor that gathers real - time data from water wells using sonar			2
farms or rural homes with wells on their property can choose to keep their information private or share it anonymously with @entity140 , which uses the data to help government agencies and others see the bigger picture of water shortages			1
then there 's the plastic tray , the brainchild of an @entity52 company called @entity160 which claims it can reduce water consumption by up to 50 percent			2
the lightweight square funnels rainwater or irrigation water toward the base of a tree and blocks sunlight , which kills weeds			2
it also captures any evaporating soil moisture , condensing it and trickling it back to the roots			0
as a bonus , the reflective surface redirects light back to the plant to aid in light absorption			0
all the companies have seen a recent uptick in interest in their products			0
" everybody for the most part has been tuned out on water ( shortages ) because within the @entity12 it 's not really been a big issue , " said @entity79			1
" the situation in @entity5 has raised huge attention to the fact that we actually do have a problem			1
" ' forcing innovation ' companies and industrial farmers have financial incentives to test new water - saving technologies			2
but convincing regular consumers to change their ways is trickier			0
one part of public awareness means doling out practical advice on how to save water at home , such as only watering lawns at night , not running the dishwasher until it 's completely full , and taking shorter showers			2
oftentimes , people wo n't be spurred to action without some sort of incentive , or at least evidence that a lack of water has a negative impact on their lives			2
eventually , the fruits and vegetables people expect to get in grocery stores wo n't be there , or they 'll be much more expensive because they 're imported from other countries			0
saving money on water bills is n't going to be a big motivator , according to @entity223			0
" right now water has been cheap and it will continue to be cheap , " he said			0
" it 's not the price , it 's whether its even going to be available			0
" @entity229 sells equipment to farms and vineyards and works with @entity160			0
he sees first hand the steps the agriculture industry is taking to combat a looming water shortage			1
the drought has inspired many companies to test out new solutions			0
" it 's forcing innovation , without question , " he said			0
how oceans can solve our freshwater crisis			0

a major drought has hit @entity5 , and new tech is springing up to address water shortages
many researchers are focusing on agriculture , which makes up 70 % of our water usage
the @entity44 kicks off @entity45 on sunday to bring more attention to water issues
