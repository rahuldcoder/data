when you get married , ideally it 's for keeps			0
that 's wonderful and devoutly to be wished for -- but you 're also left with a wide and weird base of knowledge that you 'll ( hopefully ) never use again			0
my husband and i planned our wedding in the course of 83 days , and by all accounts , things went pretty well for both us and the guests			1
friendships were forged , food and drink were savored , a baby ( not ours ) was made , and everyone left danced - out , hung - over , happy , and asking us if we would please consider hosting a wedding reunion the next year			1
i also got a crash course in managing my stress levels , tempering my expectations , leaning into the people who love us , and all sorts of other emotional matters that the glossy bridal mags might not necessarily cover			0
six - and - a - half years later ( and still going strong ! ) , perhaps a bride - or groom - to - be might find these tips a useful addition to their hope chest			1
wedding photos : when snap - happy guests go too far 1			1
give in to the chaos the ice swan may melt , the sound system could go on the fritz , it might rain toads -- you 'll still be just as married as you would have been had everything gone according to plan			1
i spent countless hours fussing over hand - writing little table cards , decoupaging candle holders , researching glove lengths and going over all possible natural disasters that could keep our loved ones from attending our nuptials			1
all that did was stress me out and deflect from the actual purpose of the day : marrying the man i love , in the company of our friends and family			1
then a wise , kind friend offered some perspective			0
she told me that the two of us could serve @entity62 and iced tea in a @entity65 parking lot , and everyone would be just as happy , because they 'd be there to celebrate the union of two people they love			0
while i still put in some fretting hours after that , it helped me see the wedding as being less about perfection , and more about celebration			1
remember that they 're all rooting for you say something does go off kilter -- you trip on your hem and faceplant into the cake , the wedding elephant has an accident on the floor or you fumble the name of your beloved a la princess @entity84			2
if people laugh , it 's because it 's all part of the grand story that 's unfolding -- not because they 're gleeful about a screw - up			2
they 're there because they 're on your side and are grateful to be part of this momentous occasion , and if they 're not , why the heck are they at your wedding ? seriously , take a look at that guest list and snip , snip , snip			2
let your loved ones help -- but on your terms my husband and i had a fairly @entity104 wedding -- both to cut down on costs and to put our own stamp on the ceremony that would mark the beginning of our married life			1
we also did n't have a wedding party , because it was a small - ish event and we did n't want people to feel left out			1
so we asked people if they 'd like to help in ways that did n't cost them anything , celebrated their talents in ways they were happy to share , and where we provided supplies and general guidelines			0
two musician friends sang as we walked down the aisle , an artist friend carved pumpkins to decorate outside , my sister - in - law rallied willing guests to arrange the flowers we 'd bought and picked , and some writers crafted a ritual that celebrated our communal love of food			1
my best friend from college looked after our mutually - beloved whippet dog , another surprised me with a piece from my favorite poet ( @entity139 )			2
my husband 's best friend officiated the ceremony , and we let our musically - inclined friends pick the songs they 'd most like to dance to			1
people were also free to simply eat , drink and be merry			0
the upshot is that our loved ones felt like they had a stake in our wedding -- and in our marriage -- and that feeling continues to this very day			2
stay awake and pay attention i took to calling this " bridal fugue			0
" ask just about any married person if they can remember every detail of their wedding and reception and chances are that it 's riddled with big , blurry chunks			2
it 's a joyous , often overwhelming day -- and it 's only going to happen once			0
on the advice of a dear friend , i picked up @entity166 's " @entity165			0
" the author is a counselor who specializes in transitions from single to married , childfree to parenthood , and the like			0
@entity171 suggests preparing yourself to stop and take mental snapshots of what 's going on around you , and how you feel in that moment , so you can be extremely present on your wedding			1
thanks to this , while i do n't have every second of our wedding day running on an endless loop in the back of my brain , i have very vivid memories of taking vows , looking out into the room to see so many people i adore all assembled in one place , funny surprises from my friends and family , and dancing until my feet felt like they were on fire			1
even if we were to lose every single picture from that day , these images and feelings would be locked in my heart forever			0
there 's a letdown -- and that 's ok after our post-wedding day brunch , i sat down in a walk - in closet and cried			2
this had nothing to do with regret , second - guessing or sadness ; i 'd just married my favorite man on @entity210 and i was happier in my life than i 'd ever been before			2
but we 'd just spent the vast majority of our time over the previous months focusing our energy on planning the joyous event , and the last guests had just said their goodbyes			0
all those wedding guests we adore were never again going to be in the same place at the same time , the spotlight was off me , and i was no longer a single woman , girlfriend or bride - to - be			1
i was someone 's wife -- a wonderful , but slightly scary new role			0
and it was time to step into it			0
i cried a little more and spent a moment saying goodbye to the single self i 'd always known			0
then i took a deep breath , stood up , walked out of that closet and went to find my new husband			0
