@entity0 -- jet - setting spiritual gurus			2
@entity8 's religious wealth belies the nation 's dire poverty			1
an inventory under way of a hoard of jewels , gold , diamonds , gems , antique idols stashed for hundreds of years in a centuries - old @entity20 shrine in southern @entity8 is generating comparisons with the economic costs of the country 's mega programs and foreign investment plans running into billions of dollars			1
under orders of @entity8 's @entity28 , officials since last week have been auditing precious royal offerings kept in underground vaults of the famed @entity32 temple in the coastal state of @entity34			1
@entity35 , the shrine 's executive officer , explained court - appointed observers were making records of the treasure			1
the stock - taking came after a legal petition over allegations of temple mismanagement			2
" the find is quite surprising , " @entity35 told @entity1			0
experts have yet to evaluate the wealth uncovered in the ongoing exploration that has sparked a debate in @entity8 whether the haul can be put to public use in a country where a quarter of its billion - plus population still lives on less than a dollar a day			1
" so how about dismantling what are essentially parallel economies by opening these vaults up and use the money to set up private schemes that can bring material comforts to the poor ? sure , many of these religious institutions have social schemes already running			2
but clearly , much more needs to be done , " wrote the @entity67 tuesday in an editorial headlined " @entity69			1
" @entity8 media suggest the worth of the new - found religious trove is more than the nation 's expenditure on education			1
" it can help meet the central ( federal ) government interest and debt payment liability for our four months and is equivalent to seven month 's defense spending , " wrote the @entity76 in an article			2
@entity35 , who is part of the team examining the temple 's secret cellars , would neither confirm nor deny reported estimates			2
" there is no official announcement on the evaluation as per the @entity28 guidelines			0
the value is put out by the media only			1
but i will not say it is not correct , " he joked			0
@entity20 - majority @entity8 is home to almost all of the world 's major religions			1
many holy sites in the country are run by independent administrations			0
spiritual leaders also command massive following			0
and religion , political analysts say , plays a major role in national and state elections			0
" no doubt there is a strong school of thought that advocates state control of super-rich temples			0
but the ground reality is that the state machinery finds it impractical to step in as any such move could backfire because of deep sentiments involved , " says political commentator @entity112			0
" there a sort of equilibrium between religion and politics in @entity8 as it is a secular country			1
so , wealth , such as the one discovered from the @entity128 temple , remained a dead asset all these years			0
it will remain a dead asset in the future too , " said @entity130 , a professor of economics at @entity8 's @entity132			1
meantime , authorities have declined taking control of the sacred findings			0
" @entity140 temple is the pride of @entity34			0
the wealth of the temple will rest with the temple itself , " said @entity34 chief minister @entity142 in comments posted on his website .			0

an audit finds vast wealth at centuries - old @entity20 shrine
discoveries spark a debate in @entity8 whether the haul can be put to public use
observers say " @entity69 " is unlikely
