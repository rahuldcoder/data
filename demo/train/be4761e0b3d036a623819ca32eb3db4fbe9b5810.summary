-- @entity3 's abandoned rail and tube lines have been put to many novel uses down the years functioning as bomb shelters , impromptu party venues and film sets for @entity9 movies			2
but a new idea to create a mushroom garden in a tunnel beneath @entity13 is perhaps one of the more unconventional attempts to breathe new life into the @entity19 capital 's forgotten subterranean murk			1
" @entity30 " imagines a section of the defunct " @entity29 " tunnel -- a narrow gauge railway used for transporting mail around @entity3 which closed in 2003 -- being repurposed as a mushroom farm and pedestrian walkway lit at street level by glass - fiber , mushroom - shaped sculptures			1
its creators , @entity3 - based @entity31 , say underground tunnels provide the ideal environment for an urban mushroom farm and could supply pop - up " @entity38 " cafes at the tunnel 's entrance and exit			1
the idea was recently awarded the top prize in the " @entity49 " competition run by the @entity19 's @entity45 in partnership with the mayor of @entity3 and the @entity48			2
the competition , which attracted 170 submissions , was inspired by @entity53 's @entity52 -- a derelict section of elevated railroad which has been transformed into a park -- with co-founders @entity56 and @entity58 joining the judging panel			1
" the response to this competition shows how many ideas are just waiting to happen , on , over or under the streets of @entity3 , " @entity58 said in a statement			2
runner - up in the competition was " @entity73 " by [ @entity67 which proposes turning a section of the @entity69 running from @entity70 to @entity71 into a public swimming area			0
other entries were also highly commended including an idea for a floating park / farm / wetland near @entity77 called " @entity78 " and " bridge - it " which envisions building parks over , under and besides existing railway lines			0
" during this @entity83 summer it was clear that @entity3 's public spaces are coming alive as never before			0
there is now a popular appetite for making our outdoors more useable and more wonderful , " @entity85 , director of @entity86 said in a statement			0
shortlisted submissions will be on show at the @entity48 until october 21 .			0
