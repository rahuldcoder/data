-- you 've been up since 3 a.m. after dealing with long check - in lines , long security lines and long faces from flight attendants even unhappier to be on that plane than you , your 6 a.m. flight finally lifts off			1
" i 'm just going to recline my seat and catch a couple of hours of sleep before we land , " you think as the pilot switches off the seatbelt sign			2
what 's happening ? despite pushing that little round silver button and digging your heels into the floor , your seat refuses to budge			0
you 've just been blocked by the @entity21			1
the 2003 invention of 6 ' 3 - tall @entity24 @entity23 -- " i was tired of being bumped in the knees by reclining seats " -- the @entity21 is a small pair of plastic clips that attach to your lowered seat - back table , locking the chair in front of you in place so the passenger ca n't recline			1
proof of its contentiousness came out this week when @entity39 from @entity40 to @entity41 was forced to divert to @entity43 's @entity42 after a fight broke out between two passengers over one 's use of the device			1
despite the passengers getting kicked off the plane , the story has led to a boost in sales of the @entity21 , with the website even crashing under the weight of all that curiosity			1
is the @entity21 even allowed ? the @entity24 @entity57 says it has n't banned the device as it does n't have an impact on passenger safety			1
but most major @entity24 airlines , including @entity39 , do prohibit its use			0
it 's a similar situation elsewhere			0
both @entity65 and @entity66 - based @entity64 prohibit the @entity21 , with the latter singling out the device on its website			1
" you are not permitted to attach any unapproved device to any part of your seat or any other part of the aircraft , " says @entity64			0
" some examples of unapproved devices include knee defenders , seat belt extensions and booster seats			1
" same story in @entity83 , where carriers @entity84 and @entity85 have reportedly banned the device			0
" the use of knee defenders or similar device would be in breach of our conditions of carriage ( 14.2 ( b ) ( f ) ) which are available on our website , " a @entity88 spokesperson told @entity0			0
" the safety and comfort of our guests remains our highest priority			0
" @entity101 told @entity0 the crew would manage the use of the @entity21 by customers on a case - by - case basis			1
" we are reviewing the use of the device , though we have not received any feedback from our customers , " said an airline spokesperson			0
in the case of this week 's @entity39 inflight battle , the flight attendant reportedly told the man to remove the @entity116 device , but he declined			2
the female passenger then threw water in his face			0
the inventor is adamant that buyers should be considerate of other passengers when using the device , which costs $ 21.95			2
users of the device are even advised to print the @entity127 courtesy card , which explains to the passenger in front of them that their legs are so long their knees will be banged if the flier 's seat is reclined			0
" if you would like to recline your seat at some point during the flight , please let me know and i will try to adjust myself and my @entity21 so that it can be done safely			1
" to recline , or not to recline the incident has brought to the fore the usual comments on plane etiquette			1
some say such devices infringe on passenger rights			2
simply put , if an airline allows offers a reclining mechanism -- and some low - cost carriers do n't -- then tough luck for the fellow behind you			2
if he / she does n't like it , they should cough it up for an upgrade or request a front row seat upon booking , citing their long legs or an injury that requires extra room to stretch out			0
in the case of @entity39 , the pair was seated in the @entity169 section , which provides passengers up to five inches of extra legroom			2
others say passengers need to be respectful of fellow fliers			2
" i do n't think any of the seats should be able to recline in economy , " commented @entity175 in our article on the @entity39 dust up			1
" i have tried to work with someone in front of me reclining and bouncing around			0
i have tried to ask the person in front of me to please not recline ... i might have just spit in their coffee by the reaction i received			0
" then there 's the issue of flight time			0
is it really necessary to recline your seat on a two - hour daytime flight ? how about a red - eye cross-atlantic journey ? others -- including @entity198 inventor @entity197 -- blame the airlines for pushing us to the brink by taking away all our space			1
so how would you react to being told you could only recline your chair a distance designated by the person behind ? should airlines do away with reclining seats altogether ? share your thoughts on the issue in the comments section below .			1
