@entity0 , @entity1 -- it probably would have been just another ho - hum city council budget meeting			1
except that the leader of @entity0 's police union , and second - highest ranking member of the @entity7 of @entity8 , said he wanted to beat @entity0 's mayor with a bat			1
" i want to beat her [ mayor @entity17 ] in the head with a baseball bat sometimes when i think about it , " sgt. @entity11 said into a microphone earlier this month in an apparent off - hand remark during a presentation he was giving to the council			1
within days , the 17 - year department veteran was suspended			0
@entity11 said the " it " that made him want to club the mayor was that , despite repeated complaints , the police union contends the city is not honoring workers ' compensation claims for cops whose careers ended when they were seriously injured on the job			1
@entity34 , one of the nation 's high - profile mayors , told @entity2 on tuesday that the officers ' complaints are a " separate issue " from @entity11 's comments			1
" some people think i 'll just shake it off , " she said of the sergeant 's threat			2
" i ca n't shake off an officer at @entity47 -- not in his shower or in his front yard , but in official capacity -- threatening to hit me in the head with a bat			2
that is a severe act of violence			0
when you hit someone with a bat , you intend to kill them			0
" the police officers union called a news conference thursday , in part , to defend @entity11 , who 's their second - highest ranking member			1
three officers in wheelchairs were there , at times crying , their voices raised , as they told their stories of being shot on duty and paralyzed for life			2
they say they 've made repeated calls for months to city officials to get help with their medical claims and have been ignored			2
they are part of a group of officers alleging that @entity78 , a @entity79 - based private insurance company , has refused or made it difficult for them to get the medication they need to alleviate pain and repair or replace medical equipment			0
" i 've been calling the mayor 's office for more than a year , and no one has called me back or i 've been told to talk to another department			2
@entity11 called me back the same day , " said @entity90 , a 43 - year - old paraplegic whose squad car was t - boned in 1989			0
he said he suffered with kidney stones , made more painful due to his paralysis , because @entity78 either ignored or rejected his claims for months			0
" @entity11 was defending us against people who refused to listen , and that is so offensive			0
it 's no wonder he got upset , " @entity90 said			0
the city used to provide its own services , but " there were concerns about internal management , " @entity34 's office explained to @entity2 , so it began contracting in 2004 with @entity78			1
the police union complained for months about the company			1
@entity0 officials this month renewed the city 's agreement with @entity78 for $ 3.7 million over three years , saying no other company they 're aware of was in position to do a better job			1
@entity113 , chief operating officer of @entity78 , referred all questions about the officers ' allegations to city officials			0
mayor @entity34 's spokesperson issued this statement to @entity2 : " we are aware of the complaints of the five injured former @entity0 police officers			1
we greatly respect the service of these officers on behalf of @entity0 and the sacrifice they have made			2
the @entity127 of @entity0 has worked and will continue working with the employees ' attorneys to address their current complaints			1
we take that responsibility and obligation seriously and intend to address every complaint within the framework of the @entity135			0
" a few days after the bat comment , @entity11 apologized to @entity137 in a letter , which was published on the union web site			0
he called his remark " inexcusable , " explaining that it sprung from " frustration and anger			0

@entity0 police union head says he got frustrated at city meeting
other cops quick to defend him , saying mayor is ignoring larger issue
police : company refusing to help cops injured in the line of duty
mayor @entity34 's spokesperson says mayor will work to address complaints
