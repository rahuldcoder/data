update : on april 30 , @entity1 revealed " technology " as the winning design for their new z - 2 spacesuit			1
with almost 150,000 votes -- just over 63 % of the 233,431 total -- " technology " will be incorporated into the final version of the z - 2 spacesuit , and is expected to be ready for testing by november			1
i applaud you all for not choosing " @entity13			2
" there 's hope for the future			2
below is our original column about the design contest , published on march 28 : the july 21 , 1969 , headline of the @entity22 read , " @entity23			1
" but had @entity25 and @entity26 not been wearing their fancy @entity28 spacesuits when they stepped off the @entity29 , readers would probably have woken up to " well , that got messy			2
" to be fair , i do n't actually know what happens if an astronaut ventures out into space wearing , say , blue jeans and a @entity38 @entity37 hoodie , but if cartoons have taught me anything -- and @entity42 knows they have -- it 's that people tend to explode			1
so that 's exactly what would happen			2
of course , the @entity48 's original @entity28 spacesuit was a technological achievement for its time			1
but like all things @entity1 , it was a constant work in progress , and four missions later when @entity56 15 blasted off for ( i think ) @entity58 , astronauts began wearing the @entity59			1
see what they did there ? they added a @entity63 most notably , among some other minor changes , the @entity59 provided more waist mobility for sitting in the rovers			2
but it was also probably just as difficult to change your socks			0
" yo , @entity70 , a little help here			0
" since the @entity56 missions , spacesuits have continued to change and advance , always reaching for the limits of science and imagination			0
@entity78 , i am holding back a certain amount of praise for @entity1 until they finally engineer a loose - fitting space snuggie			1
i mean , what 's the point of going into the cosmos if you have to wear pants ? today , @entity1 is once again deep into developing a whole new spacesuit , and this time , you actually get to help decide the design			1
not any of the technical specs			0
that would just be reckless			0
" it needs a beer holder ! for your beer ! @entity97 ! " on monday , voting started on the new z - 2 spacesuit			1
participants can choose between three design models , all of which are so futuristically ridiculous that they are simply amazing			1
the new spacesuits are a direct improvement to the current prototype @entity107 , which had a soft upper torso			0
the @entity109 is made of state - of - the - art hard composite , perfect for cage fighting on @entity112			2
which is probably the first thing we 'll do with the @entity115 after we put up a @entity116			0
the @entity117 is also the first spacesuit to use @entity120 laser scanning and 3 - d printing			1
cast your vote here so , clearly , there 's a bit of serious technology going on here			1
@entity78 , with all due respect to @entity1 , none of this stacks up to the vision and engineering of the @entity133 football phone			1
really , that thing was a technological wonder			0
but so are the new @entity117 spacesuits , and when you go online to vote , you 'll have three options			1
the first option , " @entity13 , " is inspired by the oceans of @entity141 and mimics some of the bioluminescent qualities of fish and reptiles			0
its signature feature is electroluminescent wire that stretches across the upper torso and becomes visible in low light			0
to me , this is the least interesting of the three designs , though its reptilian outer shell might buy us some time with our new alien overlords			2
" @entity157 , she sort of looks like us			0
" " your mom sort of looks like us			0
" " shut up , @entity157			0
" the second design is called " technology " and uses @entity162 wire and light - emitting patches that can help crew members easily identify each other on spacewalks			1
it 's actually a cool - looking design , but i 'm pretty sure they could 've just saved a bunch of money by stealing a box of those " hello , my name is _ _ _ _ _ " stickers from a company retreat			1
" oh , so you 're @entity178			0
" " dude , we just spent the last 250 days together in a space ship flying to @entity112			0
how do you not know this ? " the third option is called " trends in @entity185 , " and with a bright color scheme mimicking athletic training gear , it 's supposed to reflect what everyday clothes might look like in the future			2
keeping to its name , the " @entity194 " spacesuit proudly supports legalized marijuana and does n't want to have kids			2
voting ends for the z - 2 project april 15 , and the winning design will be revealed by april 30			1
after that , @entity1 expects to have the suit completed by november and will immediately begin testing with it at the @entity204 in @entity205			1
these tests will take place in vacuum chambers , a neutral buoyancy lab and a simulated @entity112 environment			0
" your mom is a simulated @entity112 environment			0
" " shut up , @entity157			0
" follow @ @entity214 on @entity215 .			0

@entity1 is developing a new spacesuit called the z - 2
people were able to vote online between three designs
voting ended april 15 , and " technology " was *announced* as the winning design on april 30
