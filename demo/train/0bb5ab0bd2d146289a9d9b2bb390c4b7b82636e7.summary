-- the surprise on 3 - year - old @entity3 's face in the video is priceless			1
his mouth opens wide as he points to the person in front of him speaking			0
it was the first time @entity9 had heard sound			2
he was born without a cochlear nerve , which connects the brain stem to audio waves in the outside world			1
his parents had him fitted for a cochlear implant at a young age , but the device did n't help			2
last month , @entity9 became the first child in the @entity19 to receive an auditory brain stem implant			1

they adopted him as soon as they could , believing @entity28 had called them to care for the medically challenged boy			0
auditory brain stem implants already have been available for adults			1
when the @entity34 heard about a @entity36 - approved trial for children at the @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40 , they jumped at the chance to participate			0
@entity9 now has an external speech processor containing a microphone			2
the processor breaks up sounds into their frequency components and sends that information across @entity9 's skin to an implanted device , said his surgeon , dr. @entity50			1
the device then stimulates electrodes on his brain 's cochlear nucleus			2
the electrodes are placed where his cochlear nerve would be , if he had one			1
" he 's sound aware , but we do n't know what exactly he hears , " @entity50 said			1
" we 're relying on the plasticity of brain to start to sort this out			0
" the implant is powered by a battery that 's outside @entity9 's body			1
the procedure has been done mostly in @entity65 up to this point			0
the @entity36 approved the implant in the @entity19 for only 10 children -- five who , like @entity9 , were born without nerves and five who suffered traumatic damage			1
these cases will be used to determine whether a bigger trial that includes more children is safe and whether the device may one day be available across the country			0

" it was the most amazing thing i 've ever seen , " he said			0
" ( there are ) no words to describe how excited we were , how validated we were , for all of the challenges			0
... he 's got a long way to go , but he 's going to get there			0
