more than three decades after the arrest of serial killer @entity3 , authorities in @entity1 have launched a new effort to identify eight of his 33 victims			1
the @entity8 says new technology has allowed it to obtain dna profiles for the eight victims , whose remains were recovered from @entity3 's house in late 1978 and early 1979 but were never identified			1
" these were eight young men who had futures , and one of the most evil people to ever be on this planet destroyed their lives , " sheriff @entity14 said wednesday			0
@entity3 was convicted in 1980 of raping and killing 33 boys and young men he had lured into his home over a period of six years , promising them construction jobs , drugs and alcohol , or by posing as a police officer or offering money for sex			1
twenty - eight of the bodies were discovered under and around @entity3 's home , with most found in the 40 - foot crawl space beneath the house and garage			1
@entity3 said there were four others he had thrown into the @entity40			2
@entity3 was put to death in 1994			2
the latest effort to identify the eight victims began this year when the sheriff 's office decided to clear dozens of the department 's cold case investigations			1
the eight unknown @entity3 victims make up the department 's largest cold case , so @entity49 approved their exhumations in order to obtain new dna evidence and , if possible , identify them			1
authorities used the @entity52 samples to compile profiles of each of the eight victims			2
it shows that they are white males between 14 and 32 years old , and authorities have even listed the approximate dates of their disappearances			0
the department is now seeking family members who had a male relative go missing in the 1970s and are willing to donate a dna sample for comparison			2
" the public coming forward will allow us to do dna matches that were not available 30 years ago , " @entity49 said wednesday			0
" it 's not intrusive			0
it 's something that is very straightforward			0
we have hot lines , websites set up for people to contact us , and in short order , we can conduct any of the matches that need to be done			0
" after @entity3 's arrest , authorities learned that some of his identified victims had never been reported missing , the sheriff 's office said			1
one reason was that the victims had been estranged from their families			0
another possible reason is that the relevant missing persons reports never made it to @entity1			0
@entity3 was known to have targeted bus stations , the sheriff 's office said , seeking victims who were traveling			1
those interested in giving a dna sample can contact the @entity8 at 1 - 800 - 942 - 1950 or www.cookcountysheriff.com .			0

they are among 33 men and boys @entity3 killed in the 1970s
