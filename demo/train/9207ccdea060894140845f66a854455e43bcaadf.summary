@entity7 -- " is capitalism really about the ability of a handful of rich people to manipulate the lives of thousands of people and then walk off with the money ? " " the 1 % is doing fine			1
i want to help the 99 %			1
" the above statements are the type you might expect to hear at an @entity14 protest			0
but they were n't uttered there			0
instead , the first was from @entity18 and the second was from @entity20			1
we now have a war of words launched at the 1 % by the 1 % -- or in the case of @entity20 , the .01 %			1
these type of populist attacks escalated in the last few days as @entity27 criticized @entity20 for living " in a world of @entity30 bank accounts and @entity32 accounts " and for earning " $ 20 million a year income with no work			1
" what 's going on here ? ! have we been transported to some " @entity36 " where everything is backward ? since when does the @entity38 care about income equality ? the answer is simple : these issues are now resonating with voters			1
more than 60 % of voters support policies addressing income inequality			1
indeed , an even higher number support raising taxes on the wealthiest @entity48			2
in 1992 , @entity50 's then - campaign manager , @entity49 , famously hung a sign in the campaign office to remind @entity50 to focus on the most pressing issue of that presidential race : " it 's the economy , stupid			0
" today , that sign would be updated to read : " it 's the income inequality , stupid			1
" over the last 10 years , @entity48 families have become poorer with the median household income dropping by 7 %			1
some have termed this a " @entity63 " as prices have risen , but our buying power has shrunk			0
and just as alarming , the number of @entity48 living in poverty has risen to more than 46 million people , its highest rate since 1993			2
at the same time , the rich have become richer			0
a recent study found the income of the top 1 % of @entity48 almost tripled from 1979 to 2007 , increasing by 275 %			1
this means the gap between the wealthy and the rest of us in @entity48 is growing			2
the only time in @entity48 's history that we have witnessed this type of chasm between the wealthy and poor was shortly before the @entity80			1
but as former labor secretary @entity82 detailed in his book " @entity84 , " economic growth can only be sustained for prolonged periods of time when the gap between the rich and poor is narrowed			0
as @entity82 notes , the top 1 % -- no matter how wealthy they become -- can not alone fuel our consumer - driven economy			0
only a vibrant middle class can accomplish that			0
if we continue down this path of greater income inequality , i fear the unthinkable could occur : the death of the @entity48 dream			1
" @entity100 " -- at least to me -- is that each generation has the opportunity to live a better life than the one before			0
thankfully , we have not been a nation shackled with a socioeconomic caste system			0
instead , @entity48 has offered the prospect of economic mobility			1
it is this promise that has inspired @entity48 to dream big			2
@entity100 has also inspired millions to immigrate to this nation			0
my @entity108 father and @entity110 grandparents crossed many oceans to live in a country that offered them opportunity			0
they both were born in places where if you were n't rich by birth , your prospects for climbing the social ladder were low -- indeed , it would have been cruel even to harbor such dreams since there was almost no chance of realizing them			0
but @entity48 offered them a place to dream			2
years ago i heard @entity130 's @entity129 sum up the difference between the @entity48 and other nations when it came to economic opportunity			1
his quote has stayed with me ever since : " in the @entity48 , you look at the guy that lives in the mansion on the hill , and you think , you know , one day , if i work really hard , i could live in that mansion			2
in @entity144 , people look up at the guy in the mansion on the hill and go , ' one day , i 'm going to get that bastard			0
' " will we become a nation where our destiny is no longer based on our actions , but on the happenstance of the economic tier we are born into ? a nation where we view the wealthy with contempt ? the wealthy paying their fair share of taxes should not be a partisan issue			1
history has shown that policies to promote greater income equality are good for all @entity48 both economically and because they preserve the @entity48 dream that the rich , the poor -- and everyone in between -- can not only dream but can also achieve a better life for themselves and their family			2
join the conversation on @entity171			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity174 .			0

@entity18 criticizes @entity20 's brand of capitalism ; @entity20 urges help for 99 %
@entity174 says @entity38 talks of income inequality because @entity48 want to address it
he says @entity48 has long been a place of economic opportunity
@entity174 : will @entity48 ' destiny be based on the economic tier they *'re* born into ?
