-- a @entity2 facility says it 's ready to care for @entity3 , the 13 - year - old girl on a ventilator who was declared brain dead by doctors in @entity7 after tonsil surgery			1
" at this time we 're named as the potential facility that @entity3 and her family will be coming to , but we will know more details in a couple of hours , and we 'll certainly be happy to let you know as we know , " said @entity9 , founder of the @entity10 in @entity11 , @entity2			1
on its website , the facility bills itself as an outpatient rehabilitation center for patients with traumatic brain injuries and says it plans to open a long - term care facility			2
according to her online biography posted on the facility 's website , @entity9 worked as a hair stylist for 25 years and founded the facility after her father sustained a traumatic brain injury in a motorcycle accident			1
" we are aware of @entity3 's dire situation , and we are willing to open our outpatient facility to provide 24 - hour care as an inpatient , long - term facility for @entity3 with the required and appropriate medical staff that she depends upon , " @entity9 said in a letter included in court documents last week			1
@entity40 , @entity3 's uncle , declined to comment on @entity9 's remarks to @entity0 sunday			2
he told @entity0 affiliate @entity42 saturday that the family is closer than ever to securing the teen 's relocation			2
" we 're moving in the right direction , " @entity40 said			0
" we 've had small victory after small victory , and it 's all leading to the right direction			0
" at a court hearing friday , @entity3 's family and hospital officials agreed on a protocol for the release of the girl to another facility , but did n't specify where or when she 'd be transferred			1
by court order , @entity3 will stay on a ventilator until 5 p.m. tuesday			1
the teen was declared brain dead on december 12 , three days after doctors removed her tonsils , adenoids and extra sinus tissue			1
as a fierce court battle unfolded between devastated family members fighting to keep her on the ventilator and doctors arguing she 'd already died , the case has drawn national attention and fueled debate			1
doctors and a judge have declared her brain dead and said there 's no chance @entity3 will come back to life			1
" overall , unfortunate circumstances in 13 - year - old with known , irreversible brain injury and now complete absence of cerebral function and complete absence of brainstem function , child meets all criteria for brain death , by professional societies and state of @entity7 , " dr. @entity79 , chief of pediatric neurology at @entity81 , said in a medical report on the case			1
medical ethicists , meanwhile , say the high - profile case fuels a misperception : that " brain death " is somehow not as final as cardiac death , even though , by definition , it is			0
but family members have said they 're holding out hope and want to transfer @entity3 to another facility			2
so far the family has raised more than $ 47,000 on @entity107 to move her			0
according to the site , more than 1,300 people have donated money in nine days			0
@entity9 told @entity0 sunday that the girl just needs to be given a chance to recover			0
" her brain needs time to heal			0
it 's a new injury , " @entity9 said			0
" we believe in life after injury , all of us here at @entity10 have first - hand experience because we have a loved one that was in the same situation as @entity3			2
" on friday , the @entity123 coroner issued a death certificate for @entity3			0
the certificate , which still needed to be accepted by the health department to become official , listed december 12 as her date of death			0
family attorney @entity130 had accused the hospital of being " hell - bent " on ending @entity3 's life			1
@entity3 's family said last week that the hospital had " refused to agree to allow us to proceed " in transferring @entity3 to a @entity2 facility			1
the hospital denied the accusation			0
" we have done everything to assist the family of @entity3 in their quest to take the deceased body of their daughter to another medical facility , " hospital spokesman @entity140 said			2
