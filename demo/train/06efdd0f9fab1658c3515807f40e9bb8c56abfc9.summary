-- people have called 911 to complain about lousy hamburgers and cold french fries , but what happened sunday night in a @entity6 town may have set a new standard for misuse of emergency calls			1
the cause of the crisis ? viewers could n't watch their cable tv programs			2
and if @entity15 posts are any indication , " @entity17 " was what the viewers wanted most			1
a power outage knocked out cable service sunday evening in parts of @entity6 , leaving @entity23 customers unable to watch television , including the hit show now in its final season			1
while most viewers chose to wait for service to be restored , others opted for a far less rational course of action : calling 911			2
the @entity32 was not amused and took to its @entity15 page to post a refresher course on using its emergency system			1
the message read : " we are receiving numerous 911 calls regarding the @entity41 outage			1
this is neither an emergency or a police related concern			2
please direct your inquiries to @entity23			0
911 should only be called for @entity47 only			0
incidents that are not of an emergency nature may be reported to the @entity32			0
... misuse of the 911 system may result in an arrest			1
" @entity23 said it had restored service by 11 p.m. sunday			0

tonight 's breaking bad was super intense and very riveting by every second			0
obviously these folks were not thinking rationally when reaching for the phone			0
" when a lack of cable tv is a reason to call 911 , " i have to wonder what this world is coming to and if people truly understand the definition of emergency , " read another comment			1
a resident named @entity76 may have had the best solution			0
" when my @entity78 went out an hour ago , " he wrote on @entity15 , " i took a hint , put one of my dad 's old jazz records on the turntable , and pulled out a good book			1
that , plus the crickets and peepers , has turned this into a very good night indeed			0
