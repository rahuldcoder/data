-- records are there to be broken -- but how many more records can one man break ? @entity5 extended his goalscoring run in @entity7 to 18 consecutive matches after scoring twice in @entity10 's 3 - 1 win over @entity11 sunday			1
@entity5 , the four - time @entity12 , scored an unparalleled 91 goals for club and country in 2012 , surpassing the previous record of 85 set by @entity18 's @entity17 in 1972			1
the 25 - year - old , who reportedly earns $ 14.75 million a year , looked an absolute bargain as he helped @entity10 restore its 13 - point cushion at the top of the table			2
@entity5 has already scored 55 goals for @entity10 so far this season , 42 of those in @entity7 with 13 in other competitions			1
an incredible 29 goals have come in his past 18 league games -- a streak which has seen any suggestion of a slump consigned to the garbage			1
@entity34 defeats to arch rival @entity35 and the @entity38 first leg defeat in @entity39 had left question marks over @entity10 's form			1
but the 4 - 0 thrashing of @entity39 last week proved @entity10 means business and it could have had five or six against @entity11 had it moved out of second gear			1
with coach @entity45 expected to be back in the dug - out for the next game against @entity48 following cancer treatment , @entity10 looks in great shape to wrestle the league title back from @entity35			1
elsewhere in @entity7 , @entity52 kept up the pressure on second place @entity35 with a 2 - 0 win at @entity57 courtesy of @entity59 's double			1
there was a shock defeat for @entity38 quarterfinalist @entity62 , which was beaten 2 - 0 at home by @entity65 , while @entity66 strolled to a 4 - 0 win over @entity68			2
@entity69 returned to the scene of his infamous red card in the @entity72 as his @entity74 side was held to a 2 - 2 draw at @entity76			0
@entity69 was sent off during @entity78 's last - 16 tie with @entity79 after kicking out at @entity80 -- an incident which led to him being vilified following the team 's exit on penalties			2
but it was a less eventful evening for @entity69 on this occasion , although he did come close to winning the tie late on with one of his trademark free kicks			0
@entity74 had moved into a two - goal lead thanks to strikes from @entity94 and @entity95			0
but the home side rallied and an own - goal from @entity98 halved the deficit before @entity100 grabbed an equalizer			0
the result leaves @entity74 five points clear of nearest challenge @entity105 at the top of @entity107			0
in the @entity109 , @entity108 moved into third place following a 2 - 0 win over @entity112 at @entity113			1
@entity115 's 200th goal for the club and an @entity118 effort sealed the points for @entity121 's side			0
@entity108 's win took it above @entity123 , which suffered an embarrassing 1 - 0 home defeat by @entity125			1
managed by former @entity123 boss @entity127 , it was another former employee who did the damage with @entity130 scoring @entity125 's winner			2
@entity132 kept its hope of survival alive with a late 2 - 1 win over @entity136 in a game which was marred by an awful tackle by @entity139 on visiting defender @entity140			1
@entity140 was taken off on a stretcher to hospital with suspected ligament damage , while @entity139 escaped any disciplinary action from referee @entity145			0
" it is an awful challenge			0
the pictures speak for themselves , " @entity136 manager @entity148 told reporters			0
" i thought it was a bad challenge and i was 60 yards from the incident			0
the players knew because they were on top of it and there was a lot of bad feeling about that incident when it goes unpunished			0
" elsewhere , @entity160 was held to a 1 - 1 draw at @entity162			2
in @entity164 , @entity163 's double took @entity165 to within nine points of @entity169 leader @entity167			1
with nine games of the season remaining , @entity171 's side could ill - afford any further slip - ups and had to be at its best to see off @entity175 3 - 2			1
" i 'm happy for @entity163 and for ( @entity179 ) @entity178 after their goals but also for securing the three points , " @entity176 told reporters			0
" it remained close right up to the end and it was an edgy finish			0
" @entity185 scored twice in @entity39 's 2 - 0 win over @entity187 , while @entity189 's game at @entity190 was postponed because of heavy snow and rain			2
@entity193 scored his 226th @entity169 goal as @entity195 moved up to sixth after a 2 - 0 win over @entity197			1
but @entity198 suffered a 1 - 0 defeat in @entity200 as a late goal by @entity202 secured victory for @entity204			0
in @entity18 , @entity205 suffered a 2 - 1 home defeat by @entity207 , while @entity208 defeated 10 - man @entity209 1 - 0 .			2

@entity5 scores twice in @entity10 's 3 - 1 win over @entity11
@entity79 star has now scored in 18 consecutive league games
@entity108 move third in @entity109 as @entity123 slips up
@entity165 keeps pressure on @entity169 leader @entity167
