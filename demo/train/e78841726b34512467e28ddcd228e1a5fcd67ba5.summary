-- " within the oil crisis and climate change there is the opportunity for an economic , social and cultural renaissance the likes of which we have never seen before , " says environmentalist and perma - culture designer @entity0			1
@entity11 in @entity12 is one of many towns across the world that have ' transition ' initiatives			1
" if only we can just unleash all the creativity and genius around us , rather than just lurching from crisis to crisis			2
" @entity0 is the founder of the " @entity22 " movement , and the author of its bible , " @entity26			1
" the movement was founded in @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity29 , @entity30 , in 2005 and 2006 , with the aim of helping those communities prepare for the twin challenges of peak oil output and climate change			1
since then it 's spread across the @entity36 and to towns across the world			2
there are now 60 other projects already in action , and nearly 700 others considering getting involved			0
there is even a @entity22 storyline on the popular @entity46 soap opera , " @entity45			1
" fundamentally , it 's a grassroots initiative , and @entity0 believes that the move to an oil - free society is about community and individuals more than industry and government			1
" we use about nine barrels of oil each per year in the @entity36 , " he says			2
" the first three we can influence ourselves , the next three are down to our communities , and the final third are the government 's responsibility			0
we try and focus on the first six barrels			0
" transition works by helping local people get together and find ways they can reduce their reliance on oil as a community , and cut their carbon footprint in the process			1
in @entity27 , @entity22 have created local food guides , formed a sustainable building company , given talks and lectures to landowners and local government officials to show them how peak oil and climate change affect their management decisions			1
they have even created an alternative currency , the " @entity85 " , which can only be spent within the town in an attempt to localize the economy and reduce reliance on imports			2
the fact that so much food was brought into this rural , agricultural region from many hundreds of miles away seemed one of the crazier excesses of the cheap oil era @entity0 believes is already over			2
in an attempt to change this -- both to prepare for the day it becomes too expensive and increase the town 's resilience - transition @entity27 encourages everyone to grow their own food			1
they operate a " garden share " scheme that unites keen gardeners without land with those who do n't have the time , or fitness , to tend their own patch			0
they are also aiming to make @entity27 the nut tree capital of @entity36			0
" we have identified unloved and derelict bits of the town , planted fruit and nut trees and trained the people living nearby how to look after them , " says @entity0			2
" you can get more protein and carbohydrate per hectare from a hybrid nut tree than anything else			0
" so far , transition estimate between 10 and 15 per cent of the population have had some involvement with them			2
ideas spreading from the fringes to the mainstream @entity27 is a town with a strong tradition of alternative lifestyles and environmental awareness , and exactly the sort of place transition would appeal : the high street is crammed with health food shops and healers			1
but in the two years the program has been in operation , word has spread and the concept seems to have struck a chord with thousands of people across @entity36 , many in areas without such a radical precedent			0
" now the people getting involved now are n't just the usual suspects , the hard core environmentalists , " says @entity0			0
" we have professionals , teachers , the @entity153			0
" @entity45 " storyline was , for me , a real indication we had reached into @entity157			0
" one of the reasons why @entity22 has grown so fast is that it 's expanded into a vacuum			1
" people have known about climate change for some time , and now the idea of peak oil is spreading fast			1
but there was a real lack of action , what could you do after you 'd felt bad about it all for a few days ? that 's where @entity22 comes in			1
" it 's not about finding out whose fault it is and chaining yourself to them , it 's about rediscovering old skills , like thrift ; being practical , taking control			0
" fifty years ago we all had these skills , but now we 've become the most useless generation ever to walk this planet			0
one of the nice things about @entity22 is that it brings older people in and makes them feel valued -- because they know these things			1
" transition works by uniting local communities and forming groups to tackle individual areas -- energy , food , housing -- with the ultimate aim being the construction of an " @entity200 " to plot out a twenty year divorce from oil			1
" the @entity36 government 's own plans for the future assumes oil will be $ 65 a barrel in 2010			1
well , it has already hit $ 136 , with many analysts predicting $ 200 soon , so it 's quite clear they are not thinking this through			0
" i think [ @entity36 prime minister ] @entity212 could really do with being honest about energy			0
at the moment he is n't and that 's a very dangerous situation to be in			0
it 's no good saying we 'll up @entity220 production or going off to talk to the @entity221 , we need leadership that takes a proper appraisal			0
" @entity0 acknowledges that it 's hard for governments to take action until they know the country is behind them , but argues again , that 's where @entity22 comes to the rescue			2
" we can help create that mandate , " he says , " and revitalize democracy in the process			0

' transition towns ' help local people get together to work to toward an oil - free future
harnessing creativity to prepare for oil peak and counter climate change
part of wider plan to localize solutions and *strengthen* democracy
current record oil prices help bring ' @entity22 ' ideas into mainstream
