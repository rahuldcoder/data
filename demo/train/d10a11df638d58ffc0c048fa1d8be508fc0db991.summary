@entity0 -- @entity5 insurgents in @entity6 will be unable to withstand mounting @entity3 pressure and their only option will be to break with @entity9 and join a peaceful dialogue on the country 's future , @entity3 secretary of state @entity2 said friday			1
" they can not wait us out			0
they can not defeat us			0
and they can not escape this choice , " @entity15 said in a major address on @entity3 policy in @entity6 and @entity18			2
in her remarks to the @entity23 , @entity15 reaffirmed president @entity25 's pledge to begin withdrawing troops this july , based on conditions on the ground , and said all troops will be out of the country by the end of 2014			2
@entity15 said the @entity3 and its @entity33 allies in @entity6 are simultaneously pursuing " three surges " aimed at ending the nearly decade - old conflict			1
the military offensive will be supported by civilian efforts to bolster @entity6 's government and an " intensified diplomatic push , " she said			1
" as the military surge weakens the insurgents and pressures them to consider alternatives to armed resistance , the civilian surge creates economic and social incentives for participating in peaceful society , " @entity15 said			1
also being launched , she said , is a " diplomatic surge to move this conflict toward a political outcome that shatters the alliance between the @entity5 and @entity9 , ends the insurgency and helps produce a stable @entity6 and a peaceful region			1
" " that would leave @entity9 alone and on the run , " she said			2
although the reconciliation process must be @entity6 - led , @entity15 said , it will draw in other countries in the region and the international community			2
such efforts could build upon president @entity65 's plans for reconciliation , including the @entity67 in june and the @entity68 which is holding meetings throughout the country			0
the process , she said , must be accepted by " all of @entity6 's major ethnic and political blocs " and must include women			0
she said that in order to join reconciliation efforts , the @entity5 must renounce violence , abandon their alliance with @entity9 , and abide by the constitution of @entity6			1
" if former militants are willing to meet these red lines , they would then be able to participate in the political life of the country under the constitution , " she said			0
she acknowledged that the success of reconciliation efforts depends on the participation of @entity18 , which she said plays a " pivotal role			0
" while @entity15 said @entity18 will have to be part of the process and its concerns must be taken into account by the @entity6 government , she also said @entity18 must respect @entity6 sovereignty and take steps to prevent the @entity6 @entity5 from conducting the insurgency from @entity18 territory			1
warning that @entity18 is at risk of major instability that would hamper the war effort in @entity6 , she urged the @entity18 government to implement broad reforms and stop fomenting anti-american sentiment			0
@entity15 announced that retired veteran diplomat @entity105 , a former @entity3 ambassador to @entity106 who served in @entity18 early in his career , will be the new special representative for @entity6 and @entity18 , replacing @entity108 , who died in december			0
as @entity109 in @entity110 propose sharp budget cuts , @entity15 warned it is critical to maintain funding for @entity6 's civilian reconstruction			1
" retreating from the civilian side of the mission -- as some funding proposals currently before @entity110 would do -- would be a grave mistake , " she said .			0

mounting pressure is putting the @entity5 in a bind , @entity15 says
an " intensified diplomatic push " will join the military and civilian surges , she says
the aim is to shatter the alliance between the @entity5 and @entity9 , she says
