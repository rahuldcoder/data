-- each spring , i monitor the list of commencement speakers at our nation 's leading colleges and universities			1
who is chosen , and who is not , tells us a lot about academia 's perception of the most important voices in @entity15			1
two of this year 's most popular speakers were @entity0 's @entity18 , who spoke at both @entity19 and @entity20 , and epa administrator @entity21 , who spoke at both @entity22 and the @entity23			2
perhaps one of the most original choices , and the one who certainly stood out from the rest , was @entity29 @entity28 , who addressed the 2012 graduating class of @entity31 sunday			1
it 's not often that elite universities honor military service members with commencement addresses			1
gen. @entity36 once spoke to a graduating class at an @entity39 university and remarked , " your business is to put me out of business			0
" so i applaud @entity31 for inviting @entity28			1
he is not a household name , but he should be			0
the 38 - year - old @entity45 and humanitarian worker turned @entity29 served multiple tours overseas fighting terrorist cells and received several military awards			2
today , he is the ceo of the @entity50 , a nonprofit foundation he created to help wounded and disabled veterans find ways to serve their communities at home			2
to the graduates of @entity31 , @entity28 issued a unique challenge , one rarely heard at commencements today : to sacrifice , to serve one 's country and to live magnanimously			1
he called students to think above and beyond their own dreams , their own desires , and to be strong			0
@entity64 called this megalopsychia , greatness of soul , and considered it one of the greatest moral virtues			0
" ' what kind of service can i provide ? what kind of positive difference can i make in the lives of others ? ' if you work every day to live an answer to that question , then you will be stronger , " @entity28 declared			1
after dodging bullets , withstanding ied explosions and going days without sleep , @entity28 realized the strength he needed to excel as a seal was found outside his own physical abilities			1
in his weakest moments , @entity28 was able to find his greatest strength in service			1
" the more i thought about myself , the weaker i became			0
the more i recognized that i was serving a purpose larger than myself , the stronger i became , " he told the students at @entity31			1
he served his country and defended the weak against the rapacity of the wicked			2
fifty years ago , @entity28 ' remarks would have been the norm			1
but through the years , the focus of education , particularly higher education , has shifted from selflessness to self - obsession			0
many commencement speakers today tell students to " dream big " and " do what you love			0
" it may be feel - good career advice , but it 's incomplete life advice			1
philosopher @entity106 wrote , " all education ' worthy ' of the name is education of character			0
" @entity28 gave the @entity31 student an eloquent firsthand example			1
greitens said it this way : " the best definition i have ever heard of a vocation is that it 's the place where your great joy meets the world 's great need			0
... we need all of you to find your vocation			0
to develop your joys , your passions , and to match them to the world 's great needs			0
" not all men are meant to be @entity29 , or even serve in the military , but all men can serve			0
@entity131 recognized , " the life of man consists not in seeing visions and in dreaming dreams but in active charity and in willing service			0
" we ask our students , what do you want to do when you grow up ? instead , we should ask them , whom or @entity141 , and what ideals do you want to serve when you grow up ? that is a worthy thing to consider at graduation			0
good for @entity112 ; good for @entity31			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147 .			2
