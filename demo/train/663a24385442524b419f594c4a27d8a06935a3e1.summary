@entity0 -- since the 1960s , @entity3 's puppets have been running , singing and dancing their way across our tv screens as if possessed of a life of their own			1
but behind @entity3 's @entity10 puppets is a world almost as surreal -- where " @entity13 " and @entity10 makers create the comedic illusions that have bewitched generations of children , and earned the show over 100 @entity19			1
the life of a @entity21 if you thought the job of the @entity21 -- putting your hand in a puppet and putting on a funny voice -- was child 's play , think again			2
from hiding inside @entity30 's trashcan to lip - syncing @entity31 singing " it 's not easy @entity34 , " @entity3 's puppeteers must be prepared to stretch their bodies -- and imaginations -- to the limit			1
" we get into all sorts of crazy positions , " says @entity38 @entity37			0
most of his time is spent with at least one arm above his head			0
" sometimes we 'll be lying on the ground			0
sometimes we 'll be inside a piece of furniture with our arms sticking through a hole in a seat , " he says			2

what makes it all worthwhile , says @entity37 , is making the human connection			0
" normally i 'm looking at a monitor and making sure that you at home can see the puppet 's eyes , because they just do n't have a soul without their eyes , " he says			1
" when you can see their eyes you can tell where they 're looking , you can tell that they 're engaged , that they 're thinking , that they 're listening			2
" @entity73 's legacy when @entity73 started work on @entity3 44 years ago , he never could have known that it would become one of @entity79 's most influential children 's television shows			1
the father - of - five tragically died from pneumonia in 1990 , at the age of 53			1
but his legacy lives on in the new generation of puppeteers , like @entity37 , who bring @entity3 's fantastical creatures to life			1
" i was in my freshman year at film school , thinking i was going to be a director , writer , producer , " explains @entity37			0
" when @entity73 passed away i suddenly realized how much this man meant to me growing up and i felt like i had to do something to continue his legacy			2
" i was a part of that first generation of kids who grew up watching @entity3 , so those characters were like family to me			1
" watch this : ' @entity102 ' puppet comes to life today , @entity37 is the puppeteer behind legendary @entity3 residents @entity106 and @entity107			2
bringing to life the unique personalities and voices of these creations demands huge coordination and quick - fire comic timing to keep the viewers engaged with the characters			0
first and foremost , says @entity37 , the puppet must look like a creature from the real world			0
" you 're conscious of the puppet 's posture and making sure that it looks as though it has a believable skeleton -- you want to make sure it does n't have a broken neck , " he says			0
material world if bringing @entity10 to life is an art form , so is creating them			0
step inside @entity0 's @entity130 and it 's a bit like stumbling into @entity133 's laboratory , with drawers full of spare eyeballs , noses and mouths			1
watch this : master puppeteer @entity139 the puppets are made from foam and rubber with the seams hand stitched to allow for greater flexibility			0
the big gaping mouths are created with the same gasket rubber found in cars , with each character usually taking around two - and - a - half weeks to create from scratch			0
" we 'd like to think they last forever but they do n't , " explains @entity150 , who has been making @entity10 for @entity3 and other @entity73 productions for almost 40 years			1
years of singing and dancing their way along @entity3 inevitably take their toll and , sadly , every @entity10 has its expiry date			1
" over the years it just deteriorates , and after 15 to 18 years you have to totally replace it -- it just goes to little toast crumbs			0
" the @entity10 of @entity3 might not last forever , but after more than four decades bewitching audiences , it seems their appeal is as strong as ever .			2
