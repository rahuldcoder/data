@entity0 , @entity1 -- as outrage mounted over the assassination this week of an opposition leader , prime minister @entity3 vowed friday to press on with his plan to form a caretaker government composed of technocrats			1
speaking from his residence in the @entity0 suburb of @entity12 , @entity3 denied his moderate religious @entity13 had anything to do with the shooting death wednesday morning of @entity16			1
@entity3 said he hoped to get approval for his plan from the @entity13 and other parties " because this is a guarantee or , let 's say , more guarantees for the government			1
the government , i feel , is backed by a lot of people , mainly among ordinary people			1
i hope that political parties will translate the view of our people			2
" late wednesday , @entity3 sacked his cabinet and called for new elections , leaving himself at the head of a caretaker government			1
however , a top @entity13 party official said thursday that the call to dissolve the @entity32 and offer a new technocratic government was " not binding			2
" the party 's leaders were trying to decide whether to accept their prime minister 's decision			1
as @entity3 spoke friday , thousands of @entity1 were demonstrating in the streets of the capital in outrage over the assassination , calling on @entity47 to resign			2
@entity3 denied that his party had anything to do with the killing -- the first assassination since @entity1 's " @entity52 " -- and urged his fellow countrymen to act with restraint			1
" i already told them -- do n't play role of the law , do not respond with violence , " he said			2
" otherwise , we are trapped , because the goal of those who shot @entity16 is to make us react violently			2
" @entity3 said the weapons that killed @entity16 were also taking aim at the @entity52 , which led to the ouster of president @entity66 @entity65 two years ago and spawned the @entity67			1
" so , be careful of quick accusations , it will worsen the situation , " he warned			0
@entity3 defended the current leadership 's role in supporting the changes effected by the revolution in this @entity76 country of nearly 11 million people			1
" @entity1 people made the @entity52 for two goals : revolution against dictatorship and revolution against corruption , and they also wanted social justice , " he said			2
those goals have not been betrayed , he said			0
" the biggest proof is what is happening in the streets -- protests , free press			0
i do n't think that another press in the world enjoys more than here in @entity1			0
beside , we are not corrupt people , but if people made a revolution against us , that 's their right , and we will bow to the will of our people			2
" earlier friday , tens of thousands of mourners followed @entity16 's funeral cortege as his flag - draped casket was taken through the streets of the capital to a cemetery			1
a phalanx of uniformed soldiers escorted the coffin bearers into the cemetery			0
protesters had clashed intermittently along the route with security forces , who fired tear gas into the crowds			1
a private tv channel broadcast the procession showed a car burning			2
many of those mourning @entity16 expressed anger at the government , which they accuse of allowing a climate of political violence to spread unchecked			1
on the capital 's central @entity130 , a flashpoint for protests , dozens of demonstrators fled as riot police fired tear gas			0
sporadic clashes also flared on side streets			0

weeping thursday beside his casket , his widow , @entity144 , was among those pointing the finger at the climate fostered by the governing @entity13 party , which is led by moderate @entity151			1
" it 's an open invitation to violence , " she said			2
" i can only accuse this party			0

protests have also erupted in the central towns of @entity170 and @entity171 , the birthplace of the revolution			0
support for @entity16 went beyond his party , the secular - leftist @entity175 @entity174			1
he was also the voice of a coalition of secular opposition parties known as the @entity179 and decried violence			0
but @entity16 routinely received death threats for his criticism of @entity1 's moderate @entity151 - led government			1
he talked about the threats on his frequent television appearances but said he did n't fear for his life			0
official investigators have yet to reach a conclusion on who may have been responsible			0
@entity191 , of the rights group @entity190 , said the government itself bears some responsibility because of its " laxity " in failing to respond to a climate of rising political violence			1
" we warned the government that these incidents of violence should be investigated thoroughly and that people who have perpetrated these acts should be punished ... but we have n't heard anything back , " she told @entity2 in @entity0			1
she cited calls by preachers in some mosques in july for the killing of certain @entity1 political figures and personalities , including @entity16 , she said			1
" we did n't see the government reacting to these calls of clear incitement to murder , " she said			0
" a government has to protect its citizens ... especially if there are clear threats against this person			0
