-- few @entity2 films have created as much buzz recently as " @entity4 , " a dark tale of a high school teacher who becomes obsessed with a 16 - year - old female pupil			1
the film noir , described by its @entity2 director @entity9 as a " serial killer origins story about how a social misfit turns into an inadequate man hell - bent on satisfying his shameful lust , " was selected to open the 34th @entity15 on july 18			1
but when the day arrived , instead of the movie 's opening credits , the festival audience was welcomed with the following on - screen message : " this film has been refused classification by the @entity22 and @entity23 , in terms of the @entity25			1
unfortunately we may not legally screen the film ' of @entity28 ' as to do so would constitute a criminal offense			1
" the @entity31 's decision was based on a scene between the teacher and pupil that it said constituted child pornography			2
after the announcement , @entity9 appeared on stage with his mouth taped as a sign of protest			1
but later on , the ban was overturned on appeal and " of good report " was screened on the last day of the festival , classified as suitable for viewers aged 16 or over			1

" @entity0 's @entity57 spoke to @entity9 about the controversy surrounding the film and the state of cinema in @entity2			1
an edited version of the interview follows			2
@entity0 : as frustrating as it was , the initial ban on the film did create buzz			1
how big of a relief was the overturn of the ban ? @entity9 : any filmmaker wants their film to be seen , any filmmaker wants their film to resonate			1
in that regard , i 'm happy for the exposure -- and because i believe in the film and because i actually think it 's the best thing i 've done in 12 years i 've been a filmmaker and i 've taken the time to craft it			1
i 'm happy that the attention is there because the piece will stand for itself			2
it may not raise the questions that people expected to , but as a piece of cinema i think it 's relatively satisfying			0
@entity0 : how important is the @entity15 as a platform of expression in @entity2 ? @entity9 : this is a film festival , one with a history of protest , of showing taboo work			1
even during the apartheid period when films were banned , this festival found a way to show those films			2
the majority of people that go to see these films are filmmakers from all over the world			0
so this is the space where they would have had the opportunity to engage the film community			2
read this : @entity112 classics get @entity2 remake it 's a privilege to do what i do ; it 's a privilege to be able to have the tools to create worlds that people can engage both psychologically , emotionally and subconsciously			1
there 's a responsibility behind that			0
i worked in advertising as a director of commercials for eight years , i understand what the power of image and sound does to a human being			2
because of that , there 's a responsibility i have -- however crazy or questioning or whatever my stories are , i have a responsibility for every single person who watches my film that even if i shake their very core , i must not violate them			2
that 's my own rule			0
@entity0 : the film though is not necessarily about this taboo relationship , it 's about a serial killer			1
@entity9 : yes , i made it as a serial killer origins story			1
it 's about someone who tastes blood and gets away with it and now is on a particular kind of mission			0
and it 's about how he got to that space , that 's how i had put the film together			2
also , it focuses and addresses a serious issue in my country , which is child pregnancy			0
it focuses on an issue where if you go around the provinces and you look at stats , so many teenagers are involved in illicit relationships with older men			0
so it touches on those social issues and i hope it opens up debate			0
that was the main intention			0
and it 's also to scare the bejesus out of these kids			0
i hope when they watch my film they 're like , ' i 'm not going anywhere near some old man who 's offering me a cell phone and some pocket money			2
' and i want to scare the parents			0
i want to say , ' i know you have busy lives , and have to earn an income , but just take the time and really screen the people you hand your kids over to			0
' these people , these custodians of society , the teacher , whether it 's the priest down the road , whoever			0
the people that come of good report			0
screen them a little bit			0
you do n't know who they are			0
they could be the big bad wolf			0
that 's what it 's about			0
@entity0 : you are a new parent , so the idea of protecting children is something that is close to home for you			1
@entity9 : completely ; it resonates with me because it says that no matter what i 'm doing , i need to understand the people i hand my kids over to			1
that 's where the responsibility lies			0
@entity0 : what one word would you use to describe @entity2 film today ? @entity9 : hybrid ; i gravitate toward it because to me it says it 's in motion , it 's alive , it 's still trying to define itself and that to me is exciting .			1
