does @entity1 have anything to do with the terrorist atrocities in @entity4 last week ? the short , uncomfortable , answer is : of course it does			1
consider the choice of targets of the terrorists : a magazine that in the terrorists ' minds had insulted the @entity13			1
before they died on friday , one of the @entity16 brothers who carried out the attack on the @entity19 magazine spoke on the phone to a @entity22 journalist , saying , " we are just telling you that we are the defenders of @entity13			1
" consider that the other target of the terrorists was a kosher store serving @entity27			1
virulent anti-semitism is , of course , a staple of militant @entity32 ideology			2
militants can point to the quranic verse , " o believers , take not @entity27 and @entity38 as friends , " as religious " proof " for this position			2
consider also that the three terrorists believed in their own minds that they were holy warriors who would die " martyred " in their holy war and that they would live on in @entity42			2
one of the terrorists , @entity16 , planned to fight in the @entity45 against the @entity46 but was detained by @entity22 authorities in 2005 before could execute his plan			2
@entity16 told @entity22 investigators that " the wise leaders in @entity1 told him and his friends that if they die as martyrs in jihad they would go to heaven " and " that martyrs would be greeted by more than 60 virgins in a big palace in heaven			1
" this refers to the hadith , or saying of the @entity13 , that martyrs will enjoy the favor of 72 virgins			2
before he was killed , another of the terrorists , @entity66 , recorded a " martyrdom " video in which pledged his allegiance to the leader of @entity70			2
in the video he said , " i am firstly addressing the caliph of the @entity74 @entity73			2
... i pledged allegiance to the @entity76 as soon as the caliphate was declared			2
" this statement refers to the belief that a @entity81 caliphate , or empire , will stretch across the @entity81 world and will be led by a caliph , who is the political and religious successor of the @entity13			1
the fact that the @entity4 attacks have something to do with @entity81 beliefs can not be wished away either by claims that @entity1 is simply a religion of peace , or by political correctness , or because we live in an increasingly secularized modern era that often does n't take deeply held religious beliefs sufficiently seriously			1
( nor , of course , does it mean that @entity74 who reject fanatical beliefs bear any kind of responsibility for what happened in @entity4 , as @entity104 suggested in a much - criticized tweet , or have a particular obligation to do something to fight extremism			2
) the reason that @entity32 militants can assert that jihad is necessary against the perceived enemies of @entity1 is that there is sufficient ammunition in the @entity115 to buttress their beliefs			1
the same could also , of course , be said for the @entity118 , which is full of scenes of violent death visited on the enemies of @entity122			2
and it is also the case that only a tiny minority of @entity74 are willing to do violence in the name of @entity128			2
nonetheless , a well - known verse in the @entity115 , which for believers is literally the @entity131 , commands @entity74 that they " fight and slay the nonbelievers wherever you find them , seize them , beleaguer them , and lie in wait for them in every stratagem [ of war ]			0
" the same verse adds that if the nonbelievers " repent " and pay what is rendered in some translations of the @entity115 as charity to the poor and in others as a tax to @entity74 , then they can be spared			0
indeed , when @entity148 made a formal declaration of war against " the @entity27 and the @entity150 " in 1998 , he cited this quranic verse at the beginning of his declaration			0
assertions , therefore , that @entity32 terrorism has nothing to do with @entity1 are as nonsensical as claims that the @entity150 had nothing to do with @entity160 beliefs about the sanctity of @entity162 or that the exponential growth of @entity165 settlements on @entity167 lands are not rooted in the beliefs of certain fundamentalist @entity27 groups about the @entity122 - given rights of @entity27 to live in their @entity122 - given homeland			1
after @entity4 attacks , seven questions being asked about @entity1 indeed , there is an explicitly religious civil war driven by terrorist groups such as @entity70 , @entity177 and @entity178 unfolding in the @entity179 in countries such as @entity181 , @entity182 and @entity183 that pits ultrafundamentalist @entity184 against ultrafundamentalist @entity1			1
this war could well replicate the religious @entity186 that tore apart 17th century @entity187 in both viciousness and length			0
already hundreds of thousands have died in these conflicts			0
elements in the @entity193 and @entity194 have helped to foment this regional civil war			0
@entity196 support proxy jihadist @entity184 groups such as @entity177 's affiliate in @entity182 , while @entity194 supports @entity1 militant forces such as @entity178			1
@entity1 is , to be sure , a big tent and the one and a half billion @entity74 in the world run the gamut from mystical , moderate , pacific @entity203 to @entity204			1
@entity204 is an ultrafundmentalist branch of @entity1 that is particularly prevalent in @entity205			1
@entity204 is intolerant of what its adherents consider to be @entity81 deviancy such as @entity1 , as well as of other religions such as @entity210 or @entity160 , and it offers scant roles for women outside the home			1
@entity204 is not , however , a gateway to violence for the tens of millions of its peaceful adherents around the world			0
that said , while very few salafists are terrorists , jihadist terrorists are almost invariably @entity204			0
a similar point could also be made about @entity160 fundamentalists in the @entity46 : very few kill abortion clinic doctors , but anyone who kills an abortion clinic doctor in the @entity46 is almost invariably a @entity160 fundamentalist			0
for terrorists such as those who carried out the attacks in @entity4 last week , their @entity204 also became increasingly politicized			1
to boil it down , they adopted the ideology of what can be termed " @entity244 , " as it was @entity148 who laid out this ideology for a global audience in a series of interviews and statements he made before he was killed in 2011			0
before we get into an explanation of this ideology , it might be helpful to explore what an ideology is : it is an idea or set of ideas that claims to fully explain the world and , often , history itself			0
examples of such ideologies might include @entity258 , which claimed that history could only be understood in material terms as a class struggle between the capitalists and the workers			0
another such ideology was @entity264 , which asserted that the @entity267 / aryan race 's rightful , dominant place in the world could only be attained by the enslavement or elimination of supposedly inferior ethnic groups , particularly @entity27			0
ideologies , by their nature , are not susceptible to challenges posed by countervailing evidence			0
whether they are secular ( @entity258 ) or they are religious , they are fundamentally theological in the sense they are belief systems that are not open to question or scientific inquiry			0
@entity285 to many ideologies is the belief that history has a direction and a purpose and that at the end of this history , the world will be transformed into a utopia			0
in @entity258 's case , this utopia was the classless society of true communism , and for @entity264 , it was the @entity298			0
in the minds of the true believers , the only possible explanation for why these nirvanas have n't been attained as yet is that a pesky set of enemies are standing in the way			0
since such groups are blocking the creation of utopia , they are not simply just obtuse , they are , in fact , evil and therefore must be exterminated			0
this belief explains both @entity314 's campaign to murder millions of @entity315 who were purported to be counterrevolutionaries as well as @entity319 's @entity318			0
similarly , the ideology of @entity244 is the belief that the world will finally be made perfect after the restoration of a @entity324 - style @entity323 that will stretch across the @entity81 world from @entity327 to @entity328			1
its supporters brand as evil the people and nations that they perceive are standing in the way of this dream , including @entity27 , @entity165 , any @entity179 regime that does n't follow @entity324 - style rule , the @entity46 and its @entity340 allies such as @entity22			0
in @entity148 's telling , there was a global conspiracy by the @entity344 and its puppet allies in the @entity81 world to destroy true @entity1 , and this conspiracy is led by the @entity46			1
religious - based moral outrage about @entity340 foreign policy in the @entity81 world -- a key tenet of the ideology of @entity244 -- is a recurring theme that crops up with many militant @entity32 militants			1
the @entity4 terrorists shared in this			0
one of the terrorists , @entity355 , recorded a video before he died , saying that the bombing of @entity70 positions in @entity182 and @entity181 by @entity340 countries had motivated his attacks : " if you attack the @entity363 , we will attack you			1
... you and your coalition , you bombarded regularly over there			0
" for the @entity4 terrorists , as it was for @entity148 , the only answer to the purported @entity340 assaults on @entity1 is revenge			1
that explains 9/11 , and it also explains the terrorist attacks in @entity4 last week			1
to claim that these attacks had nothing to do with a number of @entity81 beliefs -- albeit cherrypicked -- is preposterous .			1

@entity379 : debate rages about whether attacks have anything to do with @entity1
he says they are *inspired* by some @entity81 *precepts* but come from ultrafundamentalist *interpretations*
