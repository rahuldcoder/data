-- i remember a chalk line drawn on blacktop by a group of kids at recess when i was young			0
the message was clear : this is the line you do not cross			0
if you stepped over it , you would face the wrath of those kids in whatever game we were playing			0
now turn that line crimson and color it toxic			0
this is the adult version of " do not cross			0
" this is the infamous red line			1
we first heard about it in terms of @entity22 a year ago			1
president @entity23 said that the use of chemical weapons by @entity22 president @entity26 would cross a " red line " that would have " enormous consequences			1
" as chemical weapons were deployed in @entity22 in august , @entity23 's tripwire was triggered			1
then @entity23 told reporters : " @entity31 , i did n't set a red line			1
the world set a red line			1
" when @entity23 says " the world " did it , he was indicating that much of the world long ago decided chemical weapons were an abhorrent thing to unleash in war			1
more than 160 countries signed a treaty attesting to this view			0
but why has " the world set " this one line in the blacktop , and not others ? the @entity49 and its allies ignore the violation of treaties all the time			1
they ignore the use of other terrible weapons in global conflicts daily			0
as someone who grew up wondering why we intervened in @entity60 but not @entity61 , as someone who directs a project on rape in war , i want to know : how do we decide what suffering matters enough to get a red line ? at the @entity70 's @entity69 project , we 've been keeping a live crowdmap of sexualized violence in @entity22			1
i 've personally reported multiple stories of rape in which women were hung by their wrists or burned			0
we 've also documented how hundreds of thousands of women have been raped in 16 years of fighting in the @entity78			2
yet @entity79 is not debating whether to intervene in @entity78			2
it is not struggling over what to do about the rape and torture of women and men in @entity22 or anywhere else			1
why ? here 's one gut - wrenching answer : " people divide their understanding of militarized violence into normal and not normal , acceptable and not acceptable , " says @entity89 , executive director of women 's human rights organization @entity90			0
@entity89 argues that violence against women has been " normalized , " especially in @entity97			0
" world leaders , like representatives in @entity79 , have turned a blind eye to the violence in @entity78 for a simple reason : it does not disturb their preconceived notions about where violence is normal , " she says			1
if this statement makes my heart hurt , i 'm not sure i can imagine what it means to the people of @entity78			2
i spoke to @entity113 , the founder of @entity114			0
she conceived of the @entity115 , which empowers survivors of sexualized violence , and built it with the women of @entity78			2
just returned from there , @entity113 says she witnessed a kind of dismay about the recent @entity49 response to @entity22 's use of chemical weapons			1
" although the @entity78 i spoke to felt great empathy for the @entity22 , they felt confused by the @entity49 's immediate and overwhelming reaction when -- after 16 years and 8 million people dead -- they have been waiting and demanding that the @entity49 stop supporting @entity61 , " she says			1
@entity113 and others have long argued that the @entity49 reconsider its relationship with @entity61 , which they say supports the rebel militia @entity134 , one of the main perpetrators of atrocities in @entity78			1
they are pushing for the opposite of military intervention -- they want a political intervention based on human rights violations			0
" for how many years have we been banging on the doors of the @entity146 , saying thousands and thousands of women have been raped ? " she asks			0
unlike the obvious effects of chemical weapons use , the fallout of rape is often invisible : it does n't always leave marks , and it is so heavily stigmatized we do n't see how it psychologically , and physically , tears women apart			1
with chemical weapons , gases seep in an indiscriminate cloud and infect whoever is in their path			1
they 've been called " weapons of mass destruction in slow motion , " says @entity166 , director of the @entity167 at the @entity168			2
@entity166 argues that " the goal is to have a world in which people do n't settle for disputes with violence , " but he recognizes that " we 're a way off " from such a day			2
" we still need to prevent a world that uses the very worst weapons , " he says			2
but " worst " is subjective			0
" there 's a hierarchy of sensation around weaponry , " @entity113 says			0
" but in my mind chemical weapons and mass rape are both weapons of mass destruction			1
" you could argue that the @entity49 gets involved in wars based on careful geopolitics			2
you could argue , as many do , that the @entity49 intervened in @entity60 because there was a politically viable solution on the table			2
you could say we stayed out of @entity61 because it was " messy			2
" it 's a nasty kind of calculus , this business of deciding the red line of intervention , of what kind of pain matters most			1
ultimately , however , it may not be as complicated as it first appears			0
" do the people at risk matter to the people in power ? " @entity89 asks			0
" does intervention serve the political aims of the powerful ? in that calculation , human rights fall far behind			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity214 .			0

@entity214 : @entity23 says world set " red line " on chemical weapons that ca n't be crossed
she asks : why does world have no such red line on abhorrent weapon of mass rape ?
she says in @entity22 and @entity78 , rape is " normalized , " does n't draw *threat* of intervention
@entity214 : @entity49 should *rethink* ties to @entity61 , which backs @entity78 militia known for atrocities
