@entity4 , @entity3 president @entity1 's ambitious proposal to give millions of @entity5 more affordable access to a community college education and what he called a " ticket to the middle class " is unlikely to become law any time soon			1
his plan is to partner with states and fund the first two years of community college for @entity5 " willing to work for it			1
" the @entity17 will work to push this plan through @entity19 " in the next few weeks , " @entity1 promised			2
but with a roughly $ 60 billion price tag over the next 10 years , the proposal may have little chance of getting through the wall of @entity25 deficit hawks that now control both houses of @entity19			1
@entity27 and @entity28 , both @entity25 senators from @entity3 , joined @entity1 on @entity30 and at the community college during @entity1 's speech , but neither want @entity1 's plan to become federal law			1
that 's despite the fact that @entity1 called his proposal bipartisan , noting that similar policies have been implemented by @entity3 's @entity25 governor and @entity42 's @entity41 mayor @entity40			2
asked whether he would support @entity1 's proposal , @entity28 said " oh no , no , no , no , no , " instead urging other states to take the president 's initiative , and do something similar themselves rather than create " a whole new bureaucratic federal program			1
" sen. @entity27 , chairman of the @entity51 's education committee and the former education secretary , echoed that in a statement on friday saying states should follow @entity3 's lead			0
@entity1 's proposal , dubbed @entity5 's @entity56 , would n't be the first broad - sweeping proposition that did n't get far in @entity58 , but -- aided by a presidential push -- could still make inroads throughout the country by way of state and local initiatives			1
" it 's not necessarily all about bills and funding , " said @entity66 's sen. @entity65 who serves on the @entity67			0
" sometimes it 's about the bully pulpit and raising the profile of an issue			0
" @entity65 , an independent who caucuses with @entity41 , pointed to the president 's previous ambitious proposal for universal early childhood education in 2013			0
it has n't produced results on @entity80 , but has spurred attempts to provide pre-k education in @entity65 's state of @entity66			0
and while @entity19 has n't raised the federal minimum wage since @entity1 called for an increase during last year 's @entity88 , dozens of states and municipalities have since passed laws to create a higher minimum wage on their own			1
" setting the national agenda is an important part of what the presidency is , " @entity65 said			0
@entity65 said @entity1 is " definitely in the target zone " with his proposal , but said there would be a challenge to find the $ 60 billion , which he called " a big number			1
" while he supports @entity1 's idea , @entity65 said he would n't endorse the proposal outright until he reviews the plan 's funding mechanism , which remains a massive question mark			1
and @entity65 was thrilled to learn that @entity1 committed in his speech to working with @entity27 on a bill @entity65 cosponsored that would shrink the size of the federal student aid application form , which has more than a hundred questions -- something college affordability advocates have pushed for in recent years			2
federal funding for state programs @entity1 's proposal would give states a huge break -- with the federal government picking up three - quarters of the cost of waiving community college tuition for the first two years , and leaving states to fund the rest			1
" @entity123 would have to do their part too			0
for those willing to do the work and for states and local communities who want to be a part of it , it could be a game changer , " @entity1 said			2
emphasizing that there are " no free rides in @entity5 , " free tuition would be contingent on students getting good grades , enrolling at part - time and following through on earning their degree			0
deputy white house press secretary @entity141 told reporters on @entity30 recognized that the $ 60 billion plan was a " significant investment			1
" " but it 's one the president believes is worthwhile because we need to make sure that @entity5 's young people are getting the skills they need to succeed in the 21st century economy , " @entity145 said			0
the proposal and potential effects @entity1 modeled the proposal on a @entity3 program started under @entity156 gov. @entity156 a year ago			2
" why not just build on something that works ? " @entity1 said at @entity158 on friday			0
@entity156 launched the @entity159 , a program that covers the cost of tuition and fees of a certificate or degree at any of the state 's community colleges after students already kick in whatever financial aid they can get			2
but higher education experts stress that the @entity3 program does n't make a community college education " free " since students incur many other costs to attend college -- from living expenses to lost wages			2
@entity176 , president of @entity177 , said @entity1 's plan is different ( and , she said , better ) since it would waive tuition costs and let students use federal aid , like @entity181 for the neediest students , go toward expenses other than tuition			1
and @entity1 's focus on community colleges was also a welcome message , just one of the many steps the administration has taken to address college access and affordability , @entity185 said			1
" the president is rightly calling attention to the importance and value of community colleges and of education and training after high school , " @entity185 said			0
" what the president is proposing has the potential to help low - income students			0
@entity206 , ceo of the @entity207 , a consulting firm , called @entity1 's focus on community colleges and skills - driven , vocational training a much - needed step to boost the @entity5 economy			1
the number of job openings could halve the unemployment rate , but a massive gap between the skills of prospective employees and those in demand is holding the economy back			0
and by elevating community colleges , @entity1 is helping to destigmatize what many view as bottom - rung institutions			0
" companies want to employ people with strong academics , but they also want to employ people with strong workplace skills			0
a lot of the community colleges offer that and unfortunately a lot of the four year colleges do n't , " @entity206 said			0
" this is an opportunity to move the community college system into the 21st century			2
" @entity1 also hit on a note that is a focus of @entity206 's consulting firm , addressing the need to connect community colleges and employers who could benefit from the neatly - tailored skills of a community college graduate			1
and even if @entity1 's proposal flops in @entity58 , @entity206 , who has travelled around the country , asserted that states are " hungry for reforms			1
" " there 's a lot of states who would look at this and often as you know states do n't like being told what to do , " @entity206 said , and maybe they 'll now take the initiative themselves .			0

@entity1 's plan would waive the first two years of community college tuition in states that pitch in 25 *%* of costs
that would still leave the federal government with $ 60 billion over 10 years
even though it 's not likely to get through @entity19 , the proposal could still spur action at the state and local level
