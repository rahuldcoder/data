@entity0 -- new rules meant to temper the civilian death toll from unmanned @entity6 drones wo n't apply in the fight against terrorists in @entity9 and @entity10 , the @entity2 says			1
the standards , which @entity12 spelled out during a high profile address last year , were meant partly to allay concerns many @entity6 felt toward lethal drones			2
president @entity12 said at the time the drone strikes were used with far greater frequency than his predecessor in going after militants -- including in his fight against @entity21			1
but while officials in @entity0 insist there are strict standards to prevent civilians from dying in @entity9 and @entity10 , the rules @entity12 said last year would stem civilian deaths are n't being applied in the new war against @entity21			1
" the specific standards at issue in the @entity32 speech apply only when we take direct action ' outside areas of active hostilities , ' as was noted at the time , " said @entity29 , the spokeswoman for @entity12 's @entity30 , referring to @entity12 's address at the @entity32 in the spring of 2013			0
" that descriptionâ € ” outside areas of active hostilitiesâ € ” simply does not fit what we are seeing on the ground in @entity9 and @entity10 right now			2
" in addition , the strikes in @entity10 and @entity9 are being conducted by manned aircraft in addition to unmanned vehicles , although that distinction might not be apparent from the ground			2
related : did @entity12 keep his promise on drones ? the @entity2 's decision to exempt the mission against @entity21 from the drone standards was first reported by the investigative journalist @entity57 on @entity58			1
incidents of civilians being killed by drones have helped fuel resentment for the @entity6 in places like @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66 , where @entity68 cells have sprouted since 2001			0
during his widely - anticipated remarks about drones last year , @entity12 said civilian deaths were a facet of every war			1
but he vowed to do more to prevent them in his bid to go after jihadist cells			0
" for the families of those civilians , no words or legal construct can justify their loss , " he said			0
" for me , and those in my chain of command , those deaths will haunt us as long as we live , just as we are haunted by the civilian casualties that have occurred throughout conventional fighting in @entity88 and @entity9			1
" in new criteria for drone strikes , the @entity2 insisted there must be " near certainty that non-combatants will not be injured or killed " before an attack is ordered			1
other parameters included ensuring the terrorist target is present and certifying capture is n't a feasible option			0
@entity99 : @entity21 ' rise like ' watching a train wreck ' while the @entity2 says those strictures do n't apply in the battle against @entity21 , they do claim measures are underway to prevent civilians from dying			1
speaking to reporters on tuesday , @entity107 spokesman rear adm. @entity106 described a process of choosing targets in @entity9 and @entity10 that takes into account the potential for @entity114 deaths			2
" while we continue to hit [ @entity21 ] where they are , it does n't mean we can or even that we should hit them everywhere they are at every moment , " @entity106 said			0
we must discriminate between targets that matter more to us in space and time than others , and between those that run higher risks of collateral damage or civilian casualties			0
" in the week since airstrikes began in @entity10 there have been reports of civilian deaths , though @entity131 ( @entity131 ) has yet to verify any @entity114 militants have died in the air campaign			2
on sunday night , @entity6 military forces targeted to an @entity136 - held grain storage facility near @entity137			0
the facility was being used by @entity136 as a logistics hub and vehicle staging facility , according to @entity131			0
a @entity10 human rights group said the strikes in @entity137 killed at least two workers at the grain silos , and a @entity6 official said the military was looking into the possibility civilians were killed			2
related : @entity10 town fears massacre as @entity12 noted during his remarks in 2013 , civilian deaths happen during times of war			1
military experts say that 's an important fact for @entity6 to understand , even as the government works to prevent them			0
" to suggest that we can do a clean war with near certainty that we wo n't have civilian casualties i think simply is misleading the @entity6 people			1
we have n't done that in the history of warfare and i do n't think that history has changed , " brigadier general @entity162 said tuesday on " the lead with @entity164			0
