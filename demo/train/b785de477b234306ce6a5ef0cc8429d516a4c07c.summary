@entity1 , @entity0 -- in @entity0 and @entity4 , women married to foreigners are taking to the streets to fight for their children 's citizenship rights			1
in both countries , women who marry non-nationals are unable to confer nationality on their child or spouse , rendering their families foreigners in the eyes of the law , and denying them rights and access to key public services			1
in contrast , men from those countries who marry foreigners face no such obstacles			1
the same situation applied throughout most @entity29 countries until 2004 , when -- following years of campaigning by women 's groups -- @entity33 changed its laws			1
in the subsequent years , reforms followed in @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 , the @entity42 territories , the @entity43 and @entity44			0
but in @entity1 and @entity46 , change is slow in coming			0
@entity47 , a 53 - year - old @entity0 , has been campaigning for five years for citizenship to be granted to her children			1
she began her campaign online through a blog called " my mother is @entity0 and her nationality is my right , " and last year took her activism to the streets			1
" i am a citizen of this country , i pay taxes and it 's my right to be treated the same way a @entity0 man is treated , " she said			2
" if we were in any other part of the world where democracy exists , we would n't have had to go through this to demand a basic right			0
" @entity47 has six children with a @entity37 man she married in @entity0 in 1974			1
since he left six years ago , the children have been in a state of limbo			2
four have no passports , effectively rendering them stateless			0
the family must pay for public healthcare and education , freely available to their peers , because the children are not considered @entity0			1

" even if i do n't have a @entity0 passport or citizenship , i consider myself @entity0 , " she said			1
" i was born here , raised here and live my life like any other @entity0			2
" an estimated 40,000 @entity0 women and children are affected by the country 's citizenship laws , according to government - funded think tank , the @entity98			1
among them is @entity100 , the @entity0 wife of a @entity102 , who joined the protests after her three children repeatedly encountered problems over their nationality			1
she said it was unfair for the law to discriminate against people for whom they fall in love with			0
" what can i do ? i found him and i loved him , and it 's destiny , " she said			0
" why ca n't we be like @entity33 or @entity117 ... they gave ( the children ) citizenship			2
" @entity47 agreed : " people say that the problem is with us marrying non-jordanians , but it 's not that			0
the problem remains in the laws			0
" in @entity4 , where the same issue exists , women 's rights campaigners marched in the streets earlier this month to call for law reform			1
@entity130 , a @entity46 - based activist who has campaigned on the issue throughout the region since 2002 , estimated 15,000 people in @entity4 were affected by the nationality laws			1
a year ago , campaigners handed a draft law to @entity4 prime minister @entity137 , and in march the issue was addressed by @entity139 for the first time , with a ministerial committee formed			2
but the committee has yet to meet and @entity143 believes no action will be forthcoming any time soon			0
she said the reasons given by politicians to maintain the status quo -- including that doing so would upset @entity4 's fragile demographic balance between the major faith groups -- does not hold water			1
" the same politicians are asking for @entity4 nationality to be given to @entity4 immigrants , and we know this will actually benefit one particular confessional group over the others , " she said			1

" we are talking about equal rights for @entity4 women and men , " said @entity143			1
" there is no link between this and undermining the @entity42 cause			0
the real reason is our political system ... is incredibly patriarchal			0
" @entity0 's government takes a similar position , saying a large influx of refugees from the @entity42 territories , @entity178 and @entity179 makes the issue a political problem			2
@entity187 , @entity0 's women 's affairs minister , told @entity2 she was pursuing the issue			2
" i sympathize with them quite a lot			0
i want to find a solution for these people , " she said			0
" this business of falling in love business is a troublesome area			0
" but @entity47 does not accept the ministry 's explanations for her predicament , and says she will continue her " battle " until the laws are changed			0
" there are a lot of given excuses , " she said			0
" but the real deal is that it 's ... discrimination against women			0

in @entity0 and @entity4 , the children of women married to foreigners are denied citizenship
by contrast , men from those countries can confer their nationality on their families
*neighboring* countries have reformed similar laws over the past decade
politicians say changing the laws will create issues with refugee *populations*
