-- @entity2 's president says he 'll welcome the return of @entity5 investigators to follow up on more allegations of chemical weapons use in his country			1
" we 've been asking them to come back to @entity2 to continue their investigations , " president @entity10 told @entity11 in an interview broadcast wednesday			1
@entity17 said he had n't had time yet to analyze the @entity5 investigators ' findings so far , but stressed they have more work to do			0
" they have n't finished it yet , " he said , adding that it 's clear that rebels were behind chemical weapons attacks , not his government			1
@entity30 , the head of the inspection team that visited after an august 21 attack outside @entity33 , told @entity0 that the next visit could take place as early as next week			0
in the meantime , @entity17 vowed that his government would comply with the deal to hand over and destroy its chemical weapons , but noted that the timeframe is uncertain and the costs will be great -- up to $ 1 billion by some estimates			1
and he said that his government 's decision to sign on had nothing to do with a threat of military action by the @entity47			1
" @entity2 never obeyed any threat			1
we actually responded to the @entity51 initiative , " he told @entity11			0
" we obey because we want to obey			0
we have completely different incentives			0
" @entity51 denounces @entity5 report soon after @entity55 countries said the @entity5 findings implicated the @entity2 regime in using sarin gas , @entity51 fired back , calling the report " distorted			1
" deputy foreign minister @entity60 also told @entity61 that the report was built on insufficient information			0
he said @entity51 has its own evidence from the site of the august 21 attack that , according to @entity47 estimates , killed more than 1,400 people			1
" this analysis is not finished , so the point here is not about accusing parties , " @entity60 told @entity61			0
" but the point is ... that those inspectors of the @entity5 should come back to @entity2 to complete their investigation			1
" in the same interview , he said @entity2 has given @entity51 evidence that implicates rebels in the august 21 attack , which occurred outside @entity33			1
" this confirmation and this evidence has been transmitted to the @entity51 side ... and we are in the process of studying those , " he said without citing what the evidence was			2
@entity51 will present evidence to the @entity90 , @entity51 foreign minister @entity88 told reporters in @entity92 , @entity51 , on wednesday			2
he did not say when the presentation would take place and added that he himself had not seen it			0
@entity51 has been a strong ally of @entity2 president @entity10 's regime , and @entity51 defense contracts with @entity2 have probably exceeded $ 4 billion			1
is the @entity47 back to square one on @entity2 ? the @entity5 official in charge of weapons inspectors said that the report alleging chemical weapons use in @entity2 " stands for itself , " shooting back @entity51 allegations that the report was " biased " and " distorted			1
" " it is a very sound , scientific report , " @entity109 , the @entity5 high representative for disarmament affairs , told @entity0 's @entity111 on wednesday			2
@entity114 's reaction to the @entity5 report has differed sharply from those of the @entity47 and @entity117			1
" based on our preliminary review of information contained in the report , several crucial details confirm the @entity17 regime 's guilt in carrying out this attack , " @entity119 spokeswoman @entity118 told reporters tuesday			0
she said one of the munitions identified in the report , a 120 mm improvised rocket , has been linked to previous attacks by @entity10 's regime , and " we have no indications that the opposition has manufactured or used this style rocket			2
" @entity117 foreign minister @entity138 said his country also believes the report proves the @entity2 regime used chemical warfare in opposition strongholds near @entity33			2
but @entity144 , editor in chief of @entity146 and @entity147 , said that though the @entity5 report appears to prove that high - quality , weaponized sarin was used in significant quantities in @entity2 , " i have not personally seen any compelling data that proves beyond doubt who the weapons were used by			1
" he added : " there is a degree of circumstantial evidence that appears to point to the attack originating with the @entity17 forces , but the exact forensic detail of who prepared and then triggered the weapons remains unclear and was beyond the scope of the @entity5 investigation			2
" securing @entity2 's chemical weapons : mission impossible ? @entity2 government claims a win @entity5 @entity90 members met wednesday to try to hammer out a resolution to get @entity2 to give up its chemical weapons			1
it was n't clear wednesday night how much progress they 'd made			0
reaching a deal will be tough			0
@entity47 and @entity117 officials want to include the threat of military action in the event @entity2 does n't comply , but @entity51 officials do n't want any wording that could countenance the use of force			1
the disagreement came days after @entity51 and the @entity47 reached a rare agreement on @entity2 -- a plan for eliminating the country 's chemical weapons stockpile			1
even @entity2 agreed to the plan , and @entity47 president @entity186 has held back on possible military action while diplomatic options play out			2
but even before seeing a @entity90 resolution , the @entity2 regime claimed an international win			0
prime minister @entity193 told the @entity2 cabinet about " brilliant victories of the @entity2 diplomacy realized ... in terms of preventing the @entity47 from launching a military aggression against @entity2 , " the @entity192 reported wednesday			2
but the diplomacy has n't stopped bloodshed			0
the opposition @entity199 reported wednesday that regime forces killed 24 people in the village of @entity203 in @entity205 province			0
the @entity2 opposition has blamed @entity10 's government for the violence and called for his ouster			1
@entity17 told @entity11 that his government ca n't back down on what he called a fight against terrorism , arguing that 80 % -90 % of rebels have ties to @entity216 or other extremist groups			0
civilian casualties in the @entity2 conflict , he argued , have come from rebel attacks and from his government 's attempts to root out terrorists from residential areas			2
" the army has to go there and get rid of terrorists			0
the army should defend citizens			0
you can not leave them free , killing people , beheading people , eating their hearts , " he said			0
" in every way , you have casualties			0
( there is ) no clean war , no soft war , no good war			0
" @entity2 's children deserve chance to be kids again @entity0 's @entity251 , reporting from @entity92 , @entity51 , and @entity244 , @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 , @entity248 , @entity249 and @entity250 contributed to this report .			1

new : @entity10 : " @entity2 never obeyed any threat " from the @entity47
