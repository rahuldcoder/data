-- like many awards shows , buzz surrounding the @entity2 has long focused on questions like who will wear what , who 's on whose arm and who will win a statuette			1
but another critical question has emerged since @entity12 first took the stage as the awards show 's host in 2010 : which celebrity will get roasted ? the @entity18 comedian caused quite the stir when he took jabs at @entity21 and sir @entity22 at the 67th @entity2 in 2010			1
jaws again dropped in 2011 when he questioned the sexuality of " some famous @entity25 " before revisiting the troubled past of @entity27 judging by the 2012 event poster , which features the third - time host snipping off the gag that covers his mouth , sunday 's affair may be rife with @entity12 ' trademark barbs			1
@entity12 has tweeted about his @entity2 game plan in the days leading up to the show : " i keep having to write new jokes as i pick my victims , i mean targets , i mean presenters to introduce			1
some great people have confirmed			0
" he even assured @entity43 followers that he 'll be drinking lager , ad - libbing and speaking his mind : " no one knows what i 'm going to say until i say it			1
that was my only stipulation to host again			0
" though he 's already been criticized for offending a slew of big - name celebrities and members of the @entity55 , which runs the awards show , @entity12 should n't -- and would n't -- consider toning down his act , said @entity58 , the editor - in - chief of @entity59			1
" i think he actually feels empowered by the reaction every year , " @entity58 said			0
@entity12 recently told " today 's " @entity62 that , despite making such " offensive " jokes , he has no trouble sleeping at night			1
" i think offense is taken , not given , " he said			0
" if you do n't let yourself be offended , you 're not offended			0
... my conscience never takes a day off			0
some people are just offended and you ca n't really worry about them			0
" later in the interview , @entity62 said the media have referred to the soon to be three - time host as a genius , prompting the comedian to let out a boisterous laugh			2
but @entity58 said @entity12 is certainly something of the sort			1
" it 's not as easy to be outrageous and biting and funny at the same time as it might seem , " @entity58 said , noting that @entity12 has pulled it off twice already			1
" his @entity88 joke was comedy gold for me , " @entity58 said referencing @entity12 ' quip about the former " @entity86 " star 's typical breakfast of partying and heavy drinking			1
" he could n't avoid it			0
" the rest of @entity12 ' material , however , was n't so obvious			1
with the exception of jokes about @entity95 and , possibly , @entity96 and @entity97 , @entity58 says to expect the unexpected at the 69th @entity2			1
unless the expected is a whole lot of industry jabs , that is			2
@entity58 said many of the jokes will most likely be at the expense of director @entity104 , who stepped down as @entity106 producer after making an anti-gay slur , and @entity108 , who made the decision not to host after the controversy			2
( @entity111 will host the event for the ninth time come february 26			2
) " he 'll rip the @entity55 , @entity114 and @entity115 , " who are involved in a legal row over the tv rights to the awards show , @entity58 said			2
@entity12 went after the @entity55 last year when he insulted " @entity120 " stars @entity121 and @entity123			2
" he was n't really knocking ( the actors )			0
he was knocking the @entity55 ( for nominating the film ) and then ( @entity121 and @entity123 ) for showing up , " @entity58 said			0
but , truth be told , @entity58 added , the association most likely wants @entity12 to say something that will wind up at the water cooler the next day			2
regardless of how many people @entity12 offends in the process , he continues to rebuild the @entity2 ' reputation after a disappointing show in 2008			1
a mere 6 million viewers tuned in that year , when the @entity136 boycotted the event			2
in 2011 , @entity12 ' biting humor helped reel in about 17 million viewers			1
what 's working so well for @entity12 had the opposite effect on controversial @entity106 hosts @entity143 and @entity144 , whose bits did n't sit well with critics , @entity58 said			1
awards show hosts are n't supposed to insult people in the audience , he added			0
" the way @entity152 sees it , he 'll never host the @entity106 , " @entity58 said			0
" he takes it from that point of view , so he has no problem insulting people			0
there 's no reason not to			0
" @entity12 confirmed his no holds barred approach on his blog in december : " i would say that there 's nothing too offensive in there , but i honestly thought that last year			1
so i 'm not sure of the rules anymore			0
" the comedian 's advice for the easily offended ? " do n't worry about it			0

@entity12 caused a stir when he took jabs at @entity21 and sir @entity22 in 2010
his jokes at 2011 @entity2 caused even more of a stir
the 2012 event poster shows @entity12 snipping off the gag that covers his mouth
he 's assured @entity43 followers that he 'll be drinking lager , ad - libbing and speaking his mind
