outgoing @entity1 gov. @entity0 took the state 's last four inmates off death row wednesday , commuting their sentences to life in prison without parole in one of his final acts in office			1
the move comes as the @entity13 considers a run for president -- a long - shot bid that many @entity17 only expect to gain steam if @entity19 opts not to run			2
@entity0 's office announced the move in a release wednesday morning , noting that the state 's legislature had abolished the death penalty with a law that took effect in may 2013 and that the state 's courts and attorney general have questioned whether the state has legal authority to carry out death sentences that were already imposed			1
" in the final analysis , there is one truth that stands between and before all of us , " @entity0 said in a statement			0
" that truth is this -- few of us would ever wish for our children or grandchildren to kill another human being or to take part in the killing of another human being			0
the legislature has expressed this truth by abolishing the death penalty in @entity1			1
" the four inmates whose sentences were commuted are @entity52 and @entity53 , who were convicted of the 1983 contract killing of two witnesses scheduled to testify in a federal drug trial ; @entity58 @entity57 , convicted of killing an elderly neighbor couple in 1995 ; and @entity60 , convicted of robbing and shooting a theater manager in 1997			0
@entity0 said in the statement that he 'd met with the families of the victims of the four convicted killers whose sentences he commuted , and said they would suffer through " the additional torment of an un-ending legal process			2
" " in my judgment , leaving these death sentences in place does not serve the public good of the people of @entity1 -- present or future , " @entity0 said			1
" gubernatorial inaction -- at this point in the legal process -- would , in my judgment , needlessly and callously subject survivors , and the people of @entity1 , to the ordeal of an endless appeals process , with unpredictable twists and turns , and without any hope of finality or closure , " he said .			0
