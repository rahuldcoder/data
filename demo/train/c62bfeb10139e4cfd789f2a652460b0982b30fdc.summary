" " we felt a great deal of good will that , really , time has come for @entity2 to get rid of all these restrictions and to regain its international standing and position as a normal country			0
" the @entity2 foreign minister said bringing @entity2 out of chapter 7 is an " @entity42 commitment also " since @entity2 signed the status of forces agreement with the @entity42 , which governs the presence of @entity42 forces in @entity2 , based on its understanding that the @entity42 would help @entity2 to come out of @entity40			1
foreign minister @entity18 said the sanctions impose a heavy burden on @entity2 -- it continues to pay 5 percent of its oil revenues to @entity11 , down from the initial 30 percent			1
