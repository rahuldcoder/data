on tuesday , the international community reacted to @entity2 's third nuclear test by calling its action " provocative , " while @entity5 's foreign minister warned that it was a " clear threat to international peace and security			1
" it was what @entity9 , the nation 's young leader , wanted			0
from the @entity2 government 's view , the more pressure the international community places on its nuclear testing , the better			1
they enjoy the chatter among the world 's leaders and at the @entity21 about how @entity2 's nuclear program must be stopped at all cost			1
on january 23 , the @entity2 foreign ministry notified that they intended to carry out a test			1
they also sent photos of @entity9 holding a meeting with senior officials			0
if @entity9 had not acted by going through with the underground blast , it would have appeared that he had succumbed to pressure from the international community			1
in @entity2 the authority of the " king " in the dynasty system can not be compromised			1
the date of the nuclear test -- conducted on february 12 -- is also significant , as it fell just days short of the 71st birthday of @entity9 's late father , @entity40 , on february 16			1
many @entity2 events are associated with symbolic dates for the @entity9 family			1
on december 12 , just days before the first anniversary of @entity40 's death , @entity44 launched its first rocket into orbit -- despite international uproar			2
@entity2 has staked its pride on these events			2
saving face is more important than international sanctions , even if hundreds of thousands of ordinary @entity2 have died of hunger			1
even so , i can not say the motivation behind @entity2 's nuclear test is for @entity9 's pride alone			1
it also sends a message to its people that " @entity9 leads the world			0
" even with the nuclear test , the government knows that war will not arise			1
but to its people , it can give the impression that war is impending			0
inheriting his father 's position at such a young age -- he 's believed to be in his 20s -- many in @entity2 may question whether @entity9 has the clout to lead			2
but through this test , @entity9 wanted to send a strong message domestically that he is in charge			0
what happens if they do develop an effective nuclear weapon ? does @entity2 intend to attack the @entity80 ? that is impossible			1
if @entity2 attacks , it will be sent back to the @entity84 -- the leadership in @entity44 is well aware of that			2
does this point to an eventual attack on @entity5 then ? @entity5 is protected by a nuclear umbrella -- meaning that the @entity80 will protect it			0
in return for @entity92 limiting its own nuclear weapons capability , @entity90 offers its protection			0
if @entity2 attacks @entity5 , it 's effectively an attack on the @entity80			2
another major reason why @entity2 is developing a nuclear capability is that its conventional military is dated and there are doubts about whether it can defend itself			1
while @entity2 has an estimated 1.2 million soldiers , making it the third largest military behind @entity105 and @entity80 , this is only a number			2
it may be hard to believe but for almost 20 years , there have been continued food shortages in the military , to the extent that as many as 20 % to 30 % of the armed forces have actually disappeared -- with many deserting their post by way of a bribe to their superiors			0
those that do remain in service are often involved in petty crime to get by , such as stealing from the civilian population			0
@entity2 requires military service for 10 years			2
during those years , most are discharged without even having fired 30 bullets			0
without sufficient fuel for planes , airborne troops have not had much training			0
in 1990 , i stood guard at a post in @entity44			0
the anti-aircraft weapon i used was a 1940s era model from the @entity135			0
if war is to occur , @entity2 could not stand , even for days , and it is well aware of that			2
but could it count on traditional ally , @entity105 , for support ? starting from @entity142 , the founder of @entity2 , the @entity2 regime has never fully trusted @entity105			0
the message that @entity105 is a nation that could strike @entity2 at the " back of the head " has been passed down over the years to @entity9 , his grandson			0
since @entity2 can not count on @entity147 fully , it has turned to the nuclear option as a deterrent			1
@entity2 would not risk a pre-emptive attack on the @entity5 , but the @entity9 dynasty now believes it has a card to protect itself , which is its main objective			0
for this reason , even if millions of people starve to death in the effects of the harsh sanctions , @entity2 will keep trying to develop its own nuclear capabilities .			1
