@entity11 workers carry the coffins of four staff who died in the crash			0
on february 25 , @entity15 from @entity16 to @entity17 dropped from the sky on approach to the landing strip at @entity17 , shattering into three pieces in a muddy field			1
@entity23 , head of the @entity24 , said the instrument was one of the plane 's two altimeters , which measure altitude			1
because of the " faulty " left altimeter , the plane on automatic pilot reacted as if it were lower than it was and started to behave as if it was touching down			1
the plane was at 700 meters but the instrument indicated that it was at ground level			2
this caused the automatic throttles to slow the plane down , leading to a loss of speed			2
the plane was on automatic pilot when it crashed			1
@entity44 said there had been misty weather and if it were clearer then the pilots might have noticed how far up they were			0
he said that if such instruments do n't function , automatic pilots should not be used for landings			0
investigators said there had been faulty meter readings on two other flights but the pilots were able to land			2
@entity44 said that the pilots realized the problem but failed to appreciate what had been happening until it was too late			0
in the immediate aftermath of the crash investigators said the plane fell almost vertically to the ground indicating the aircraft did not have enough forward speed			0
the plane crash less than 500 yards short of the runway			0
passengers described feeling the plane suddenly drop before impact , and at least one passenger said he heard the pilot trying to give more power to the engines before it went down			0
four of the crew and three @entity76 employees were among the nine people killed in the crash			0
@entity6 's flagship airline is well - rated internationally for its overall safety record and the @entity76 737 - 800 has a good safety record			1
the last previous fatal incident at the @entity17 airport happened in april 1994 when a @entity85 aircraft crashed as it tried to return to @entity17 shortly after takeoff .			1

@entity6 plane that crashed in @entity2 had faulty instrument
investigators say altimeter gave false reading
that made automatic pilot *implement* landing procedures while plane was too high
@entity15 crashed at @entity17 's @entity17 killing nine
