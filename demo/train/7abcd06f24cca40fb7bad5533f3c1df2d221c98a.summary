@entity0 -- fire - protection systems on freight aircraft are inadequate , top @entity3 aviation investigators say			1
the @entity6 recommended improvements and rule changes wednesday based on investigations of three catastrophic cargo plane fires			1
@entity6 chairwoman @entity11 recommended that the @entity12 require better early detection of fires inside cargo containers , development of fire - resistant containers and requiring active fire - suppression systems on all freight airlines			1
an @entity6 report focused on three cargo fire accidents since 2006			2
two of those fires killed the flight crews and destroyed the aircraft , in incidents in @entity27 and @entity28			0
in the third incident in @entity31 , the crew escaped with minor smoke - inhalation difficulties , and the plane was significantly damaged			0
" these fires quickly grew out of control , leaving the crew with little time to get the aircraft on the ground , " @entity11 said in a statement released with the report			0
" detection , suppression and containment systems can give crews more time and more options			0
the current approach is not safe enough			2
" @entity12 budget cuts would affect fliers in all three cases , the fires started within the cargo containers aboard the planes , but by the time the plane 's fire warning system alerted pilots to the dangers , there was little time for them to react			1
federal regulations require cargo airline fire detection systems to alert pilots within one minute of a fire starting , but the @entity6 's investigation found current systems detected fire and smoke anywhere from two and half minutes to more than 18 minutes after the fire started			2
the @entity6 concluded cargo containers made of flammable materials significantly increase the intensity of the on - board fires because there 's been little focus by manufacturers or regulators to develop fire - resistant cargo containers			1
additionally , the @entity6 's report recommended improved fire suppression systems on cargo planes , a recommendation it originally made to the @entity12 in 2007			1
after the 2007 recommendation , the @entity12 did a cost - benefit analysis of upgrading fire suppression systems and found it to be too expensive , a fact the @entity6 highlighted in its report			1
" the two catastrophic cargo airplane fires that occurred in less than a year occurred after the @entity12 's cost - benefit analysis concluded that the installation of fire suppression systems was not cost - effective , " the board said			1
@entity95 briefed @entity11 earlier this week on the shipping company 's efforts to develop improved fire safety standards			0
also , @entity99 is in the process of installing a fire suppression system on its long - haul fleet , the @entity6 said			0
in an e-mail statement to @entity1 , @entity12 officials said the agency " has long supported improved fire protection on all cargo airplanes through research on new , @entity110 fire extinguishing agents , fire suppression systems directed at individual cargo containers or specific cargo compartment zones , and advanced cargo containers incorporating smoke detection , fire containment , and / or fire suppression systems			2
" @entity12 officials said they would carefully evaluate the @entity6 's recommendations			0
way beyond air bags : @entity6 wants next - generation safety devices on cars , trucks			0

" the current approach is not safe enough , " the head of the @entity6 says
in ' 07 , @entity12 said fire - safety upgrades too expensive based on cost / benefit analysis
@entity6 : industry has focused little on developing fire - resistant containers
three cargo plane *disaster* probes yielded recommendations
