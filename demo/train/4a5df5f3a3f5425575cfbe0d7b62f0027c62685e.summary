-- at @entity2 , we are obsessed with robots			2
we 're a team of nerds , and we grew up watching science fiction that prominently featured robots doing extraordinary things to help or protect their human counterparts			1
we figured that as adults , our lives would be better because of robots			1
unfortunately , that has n't happened yet , and robots remain one of the great unfulfilled promises of science fiction			2
we think that 's going to change over the next decade			0
first , the barriers to entry in robotics that have typically precluded individuals or small teams from building robots are falling away			2
the rise of cheap rapid - prototyping tools like @entity28 printers is making it possible for just about anyone to design and print physical products from the comfort of their homes			2
moreover , open - source electronics platforms like @entity36 mean that hobbyists can now create custom electronic systems without having to go through the expensive process of manufacturing custom circuit boards			2
also , crowdfunding websites like @entity42 are making it possible for companies to test the traction of new robots and secure initial orders before choosing to scale production			0
even more importantly , the ubiquity of smart devices is changing the way that people are thinking about robotic controllers and robots themselves			1
smart phones today have powerful processors , an array of sensors , and a user interface that everyone already understands			1
these are crucial assets for a robot , and many startups are now exploring the possibilities of using smart devices as controllers or even brains for a wide variety of robotic creatures			0
finally , the ubiquity of @entity72 and data networks means that robots can be designed with the web in mind			1
this will ultimately allow teams to build much lighter , more affordable hardware platforms on the assumption that any computationally intensive tasks can be offloaded to the cloud			0
instead of needing to load every possible routine onto a robot before it ships , designers will be able to build robots that will download new " apps " on a situation - by - situation basis			1
basically , the cloud will make it possible to build cheaper robots that learn new things over time			1
but there 's still a lot of work to do			0
in the @entity75 and mobile ecosystems , a lot of the most incredible innovations over the last decade have been design innovations			0
companies like @entity101 , @entity102 , and @entity103 are n't revolutionary because they pushed human technology forward ; they are revolutionary because they made technology more usable			0
surprisingly , the exact opposite trend has occurred in robotics			0
at a research level , there have been incredible technological innovations over the last 10 years			0
see this striking example , or this one			0
but these systems are too expensive and complicated for nontechnical people to buy and use			0
as we think about how robots will begin helping us in all different aspects of our lives over the next decade , we believe that design innovation in robotics will be at least as important as tech innovation in finally making robots available to a majority of people in the world			1
and we think that it wo n't be until robots are truly accessible -- 14 - year - olds hacking on @entity72 - connected , computer - vision - capable robots in their garages on the weekends -- that innovation in robotics will really take off in earnest			1
my company , @entity2 , builds a small , affordable robot that uses an iphone as his brain			0
@entity141 can learn new things over time and can stream two - way video with any @entity146 device , anywhere in the world			0
in order to become part of our daily lives , robots will need to be friendly , simple , and robust			1
@entity141 is a small step in that direction			0
@entity156 , longtime president of the @entity157 , said that people tend to overestimate the effect of a new technology in the short run and underestimate the effect over the long term			0
that 's absolutely the case in robotics , where it 's easy to dismiss early attempts as toys but hard to imagine how robots will fundamentally change our lives over the next few decades			1
robots will be able to guard your house while you 're away , babysit your kids , or keep you company when you 're alone			1
drones could tend to gardens and farms while people control telepresence robots on the other side of the world via heads - up displays like @entity187			1
corporations are n't going to build these robots , but hackers will			2
that 's why making robotics accessible and affordable is so important , and why i believe we 're finally poised to build the robots that we fell in love with in sci - fi movies decades ago			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity200 .			2

@entity200 : his company is a team of nerds with sci - fi **dreams** of robots that *enhance* lives
he says *combination* of smart phones , @entity72 and the cloud enables **dreams** to become real
hackers are in position to innovate with robots in many ways , he says
