-- @entity2 's democratically elected parliament met monday for the first time since president @entity4 was ousted last year			1
but even with @entity4 out of power and facing criminal charges , @entity2 still has a long way to go			1
the protests started exactly one year ago , on january 25			1
many @entity2 say they are frustrated with the pace of change			1
there have even been violent clashes between protesters and the military , which has led the country since @entity4 resigned february 11			1
( thousands gather in @entity17 on anniversary ) @entity0 's @entity19 recently spoke to some prominent @entity2 about the country 's " unfinished revolution " and why there is still unrest			1
here is some of what they had to say : @entity27 , former presidential candidate and @entity29 laureate the army was welcomed as a savior , as the national army that stood by the people			1
as you remember , there were roses that were thrown over the tanks , that sort of thing			1
but then we started the whole mismanagement			2
the army got this hot potato on their lap. they did n't expect it to happen			2
they have zero experience managing the country politically , and they started to make one mistake after the other			1
... everybody after the revolution thought their salary would be tripled in three days			2
i mean , obviously , this was expected , but the army was very rough - handed in dealing with people			2
( the army ) got into a sort of irrational way of going through the transition : going through a parliamentary election before you have a constitution			2
giving new political parties three months to organize and be able to compete with the @entity65 , who have been on the ground for 80 years			2
having all the weird laws about redistricting , about establishing new parties			2
it led to the country being decimated			1
add to that 60 years of oppression , and it was like a pressure cooker , and all of a sudden the lid went up			2
there was a lot of vapor coming out			2
how to manage to get that into meaningful energy is still a question for us today			2
people were not used to democracy			1
people did not know how to be able to agree to disagree , did n't know how to work together			2
all of this is the result of years and years of repression			2
@entity90 , prominent human rights activist we did n't even believe we would get to @entity92 , let alone this would be a revolution			1
one person actually said , " so if we get to @entity92 , then what ? " and the answer was , " we 'll figure it out when we get there			2
" nobody imagined that this many people would go there ; nobody imagined that this many people would show up			2
we were used to the same 20 to 50 people that showed up to every single protest , and they were mostly your friends and fellow activists			2
but january 25 was different			2
... what made me realize that this was unstoppable was i looked behind me sometime , and i could not see the end of the march , like i could n't see where the march ended			0
all i saw , whether i looked to my left or right or to the back , was a sea of people			0
i knew then there was no way of stopping this			0
" what are they going to do ? they can fire at us , but we are just so many this day			0
" ... being a revolutionary myself and being in the street and taking part in these clashes , you know that all these people are fighting for a better @entity2			1
they do n't have hidden agendas			0
they do n't get finance from abroad			0
they are simply fighting for their rights , they 're fighting for a better living , and they 're not going to stop , because we sacrificed so much			0
we sacrificed so much to reach where we are right now			0
there is no way of going back			0
@entity145 , newspaper publisher and human rights activist you have now people on the street say , " i thought this revolution was for me , but i 've been jobless for the last three months			1
" ... now there is a lot of frustration , and people are beginning to wonder whether things went wrong and whether they should have stayed under the @entity4 regime that was at least providing stability			1
... there were too many expectations			0
raising the expectations was probably the biggest mistake , and media probably have a great part to do with that			0
... @entity165 presented this as a revolution as opposed to an uprising			0
... it put a lot of high hopes on the caretaker cabinet			0
and eventually , as nothing was happening , the frustration level increased , and we began to see more and more protests , more and more violence and less and less faith in the future			1
so while the military has made serious mistakes , we should not have expected more			1
... a lot were critical of ( the ruling military 's ) slow pace , that it will take roughly 16 months , 18 months before we do the transition			1
i do n't think it was possible in anything less than that			0
@entity190 was a much faster pace , but @entity190 is 10 million people			0
we are 80 million people			0
... over the next five years , when you start to built the instruments of good governance , a parliament , a judiciary , and establish civilian rule , the military will have to give up their privileges			1
it has to be slow			0
we need to avoid a collision course with them			0
... if we go for reform too quickly or we get into a collision course with the military , remember @entity207 ? remember @entity208 ? they did have a free election , both countries , and yet they relapsed into military rule			1
@entity214 , activist who was 20 years old at the time of the revolution very few people actually saw a full - scale revolution taking place that soon			1
i always knew it was coming			0
i did n't know it was going to come that soon			0
i was depending on the privileged upper - middle class members of the @entity2 society to hit the streets for the first time ... because i knew , sadly , there is a lot of classism in our culture , and no big change would come about in our society until those who were more privileged went to fight for those who were less fortunate			1
... on the 11th of february , i felt that the hard bit was over , although i knew there was a lot of work to be done			0
the element of oppression , of being oppressed by the regime , i thought that was over			0
but over the last year , i realized not only was i mistaken , but there have been more attempts to oppress the @entity2 youth over the last year than during the 30 years of the @entity4 regime			1
... i had been demonstrating for many years under the @entity4 regime , which is why it is ironic that the most times i 've ever been beaten , the most times i 've ever felt the threat of danger , was after @entity4 stepped down			1
and all of these are very basic indications that the regime that is ruling us at the moment is merely a continuation of the @entity4 regime , that its main intent or goal is to protect themselves from the revolution , not to protect the revolution			1
@entity263 , assistant lecturer at @entity264 i did n't expect it to be this way			0
i did n't expect that it would be this big			0
me and all my colleagues and friends , we were not aiming at bringing @entity4 down			1
we were just aiming at more social justice			0
we were aiming at reforming the police			0
so we did n't think that people would do that much support , but they did			0
... i can tell you , i want peace			0
i do n't want more protests			1
but if i did n't find any other way , i did n't find any other way			1
i am part of this country , and i 've been asking for my rights in a peaceful way			1
but i did n't get it , and i did n't even get an explanation			0
and i have found violence			0
the army , the @entity288 , we were thinking it was protecting us in the beginning of the revolution , now it is violating our rights			0
it 's our first revolution ! we have no experience .			1
