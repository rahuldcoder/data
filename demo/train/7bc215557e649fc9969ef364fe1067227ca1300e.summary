-- @entity1 admits his personal problems are affecting his game , but the world 's top golfer refused to blame media intrusion on his life for his disastrous return to the @entity9 this week			1

on friday , he slumped to a seven - over - par 79 that saw him miss the weekend rounds by eight shots -- and a massive 17 behind leader @entity25			1
it was his second - worst single - round score behind the 81 he carded at the 2002 @entity27 , and his highest 36 - hole total meant he missed the cut in a non-major for the first time since 2005			1
the 34 - year - old , who took a five - month break from playing following the scandal over his admitted marital infidelities , admitted he was feeling pressure due to continued questioning about his private life			2
" well , i get asked every day			0
every day i do media , i get asked it , so it does n't go away			0
even when i 'm at home , paparazzi still follow us , helicopters still hover around , " @entity1 told reporters in quotes carried by his personal web site			1
" does it test you ? yes , of course it does			0
is that any excuse ? no , because i 'm out there and i have the same opportunity as everybody else here in this field to shoot a good number , and i did n't do that			0
" @entity10 will hope to address problems with his game ahead of the @entity62 at @entity63 in @entity64 starting next thursday			1
" it 'll be interesting because i 'll probably get home and hit balls on the range , and i 'm going to have to get up there to @entity63 a little early to putt because @entity70 is all torn up , " he said			2
" my short game was terrible			0
i three - putted there twice back - to - back , and you ca n't do that			0
i did n't get up - and - down at six and chipped the ball off the green at seven			0
those shots , you 're just throwing away shots when you do stuff like that			0
" you have to let it go			0
it 's like baseball , you go 0 for 4 two days in a row like i did , you 've got a whole new tournament next week , which is great			2
" while @entity1 struggled at @entity87 , the 43 - year - old @entity25 shot his second successive 68 to claim a one - shot lead from @entity90 's @entity89			1
last year 's @entity91 champion , who played his first two rounds with @entity10 , fired a 67 featuring an eagle , four birdies and two bogeys			1
current masters champion @entity96 also carded 68 to be in a tie for third another shot back on 138 along with fellow @entity100 @entity99 ( 64 ) , @entity101 ( 65 ) and @entity102 ( 70 )			2
meanwhile , @entity104 's @entity103 will take a three - stroke lead into the final round of the @entity107 in @entity108			2
