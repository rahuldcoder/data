@entity0 -- tuesday 's @entity3 decision in @entity4 -- holding that , after being informed of their rights , suspects must explicitly tell police that they want to stay silent to invoke their @entity10 protections -- indeed turns @entity10 " upside down , " as one dissenting justice put it			1
its potential consequences are as predictable as night following day : police will interrogate criminal suspects who do not explicitly invoke their rights -- often , those will be suspects who are unsophisticated , poorly educated or mentally ill -- for hours on end			0
this will lead , just as inevitably , to more coerced -- and therefore unreliable -- confessions			0
and this will result in wrongful incarceration and diminish our collective security			0
this is the very phenomenon that @entity10 aimed to eliminate			1
to be sure , the ruling is a setback for the protections designed to ensure an effective criminal justice system ( @entity10 requires police officers to inform suspects of the right to remain silent and the right to an attorney )			1
but there is one silver lining in @entity37 ' cloud : the ruling demonstrates that the @entity3 is not shy about curtailing @entity10 protections , even without prodding from @entity39			1
hence the ruling should derail @entity39 ' recent calls to enact an unnecessary , likely overbroad and possibly unconstitutional statute further restricting @entity10 's requirements			1
the issue arose when attorney general @entity44 , among others , called on lawmakers to step in and limit @entity10 by expanding the " public safety exception			1
" that exception allows law enforcement officials to interrogate suspected terrorists for a limited time before advising them of their miranda rights -- if the officers are " reasonably prompted by a concern for public safety			0
" but this call for codifying has always been somewhat baffling , as it is so clearly not needed			0
expanding of the public safety exception legislatively may score political points for lawmakers or government officials bent on appearing tough on terrorism , but such action would not improve the efficacy of our counterterrorism policy			2
in fact , the public safety exception in its current form has proved extremely effective in allowing law enforcement the necessary flexibility in questioning terror suspects			0
after two recent attempted terror attacks , both the " underwear bomber " suspect , @entity77 , and " @entity80 bomber " suspect @entity78 were questioned under the public safety exception			0
they both reportedly provided interrogators with valuable intelligence during that time and continued to do so even after being advised of their rights			0
as the attorney general himself observed , " the giving of @entity10 warnings has not stopped these terror suspects from talking to us			1
they have continued to talk even though we have given them a @entity10 warning			2
" legislation on the public safety exception is also risky			0
while courts consider the issues that come to them on a case - by - case basis , deciding what the law requires in the context of a particular set of circumstances , @entity39 must act in the abstract , imagining a variety of situations that might occur and attempting to draft a law able to address each of them			2
thus any congressional attempt to define the scope of the public safety exception , especially in a political environment dominated by a sense that the next terrorist attempt might occur at any moment , is likely to overreach			2
moreover , we know from the 2000 case @entity121 , which struck down a law aimed at limiting the scope of @entity10 , that the @entity3 will draw the line on curtailing @entity10 's protections			1
thus any statute passed now to expand or codify the exception runs the risk of judicial invalidation			0
the result would be that any convictions secured through confessions elicited under the invalidated law would be reversed			0
today 's decision , however , removes any doubt about whether @entity39 should take action			1
without @entity39 ever introducing a bill or taking a single vote , the @entity3 just expanded significantly law enforcement officials ' ability to interrogate at length all criminal suspects , terrorists or otherwise , even after they have been properly mirandized			1
until suspected terrorists unambiguously assert their desire to remain silent , government officials may continue to interrogate them for hours or even days , using any statement they make against them in subsequent prosecution			2
moreover , this decision sends a strong signal : while it might look with hostility on congressional attempts to rein in the scope of the @entity10 rule , the @entity3 itself is willing to interpret narrowly the protections that @entity10 affords criminal defendants			1
and it is willing to reach relatively far to do so			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			2

@entity164 says @entity3 ruling easing up on @entity10 protections is setback
but , she says , it should cause @entity39 to back off on legislating @entity10 changes
@entity39 stepping in on @entity10 risks political overreach , court *challenges* , she says
@entity164 : @entity3 has shown it 's willing to make own narrow interpretation on @entity10
