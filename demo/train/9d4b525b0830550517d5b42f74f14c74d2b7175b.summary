in the space of six weeks , with great displays of importance , @entity1 's capital will have hosted two world leaders who no longer speak with each other : the presidents of @entity7 and the @entity8			1
@entity1 sits uncomfortably between these two adversaries			1
pick your geopolitical topic -- @entity12 , @entity13 , @entity14 -- and you can be sure that @entity16 and @entity17 will be at odds with each other			0
@entity20 has been watching from afar , sitting on the fence			0
it is fair to ask if @entity1 's stance is sustainable			2
can you simultaneously court close friendships with two states whose foreign policies are designed to hurt the other ? in @entity32 worldview , the answer is a resounding yes			0
when @entity35 spoke with the @entity1 prime minister earlier this year , in his only interview since assuming office , @entity34 explained how he saw a changed world order			1
" if you look closely , you will see that every country is trying to build relations with other countries , " he said			1
they may be part of one bloc , but they also sit with fierce opponents			0
when pushed specifically on @entity7 's annexation of @entity50 , a hostile takeover @entity20 refused to condemn , @entity34 pushed right back			1
" in the world right now , a lot of people want to give advice			2
but look within them , and they too have sinned in some way			0
" the comment could be seen as a subtle dig at @entity17 's foreign policy missteps			0
however , @entity34 's point was not to admonish the @entity8 , but to suggest that all nations have their own value systems and perceived flaws			1
india¹s way of navigating flawed global players was by making friendships and opening channels of opportunity			0
the subtext to this is simple : economics			0
the reason why @entity34 has traveled all over the world in his first few months in office -- @entity76 , @entity77 , @entity78 , @entity79 -- is not because he wants to be a foreign policy leader ; @entity34 wants to bring business to @entity1			2
so : as you read about and see images of @entity85 grand reception in @entity20 this week , keep an eye not on the rhetoric , but the outcomes and deals struck			2
@entity7 is the world 's second largest exporter of arms ; @entity1 is the world 's biggest importer			1
@entity7 is one of the world 's biggest producers of oil and gas ; @entity1 is one of the biggest consumers			1
the two sustain each others ' needs			0
and as long as they do , they will court each other , with the @entity8 watching on .			2

@entity1 sits uncomfortably between @entity7 and @entity8 , writes @entity35 's @entity107
@entity107 : @entity34 told @entity35 he saw a changed world order
" every country is trying to build relations with other countries , " @entity34 said
during @entity117 's visit , it 's worth *focusing* on the outcomes and deals struck , says @entity107
