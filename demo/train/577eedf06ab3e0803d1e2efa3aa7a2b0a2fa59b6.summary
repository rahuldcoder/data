-- this will be the first @entity2 since my buddy from the @entity5 committed suicide last june			1
as the holiday draws closer , the series of text messages i received from our mutual friend on that spring day keep pushing their way into my mind			1
" i 'm sorry for the text , man			2
but i just ca n't do any more phone calls today			2
" there was a moment of silence before he continued to write that our friend " blew his brains out yesterday			2
the funeral is saturday in @entity28			2
that 's all i know at this point			2
i 'll give you a call tomorrow			2
" i remember looking out the car window at the lights of random buildings flashing by as i sat in the passenger seat on the way home from my niece 's wedding			1
my heart pounding as the familiar sense of violent death and loss worked its way into me			2
in the years since i fought in @entity46 and @entity47 , @entity2 has always had a certain type of sting to it			1
it has been a day for quiet reflection and thoughts of friends who 'd fallen			1
men like @entity5 capt. @entity56 , or " @entity60 , " as we affectionately called him , who was killed by a sniper in @entity59 , @entity46 in 2006			1
brothers who now , still , years later , i think of every day			1
@entity64 , along with others i 've known , fell while serving as @entity5 engaged in combat with an enemy who was trying to kill them			2
but this year things already feel different			0
because my buddy died by his own hand			0
so it became clear that the cost of a war is even greater than i could imagine			0
because war has such an insatiable appetite for death that it continues to kill @entity5 and soldiers long after they 're done actively participating in it			0
iraq war vet introduces military suicide prevention bill the day he took his own life , my friend posted a picture of himself on @entity84			1
the photo has since been removed , but the look in his eyes has been burned into me forever			0
i thought i could see a mix of sadness and anger in his eyes			1
and i can still feel a silent and private hopelessness			0
i remembered how in my own dark time after the war -- it lasted nearly two years -- my soul felt like it had been shot to pieces by things i saw			0
and the things i did			0
i recalled how life becomes somehow smaller as you systematically isolate yourself from those you love			0
and those who love you			0
what is wars ' true toll on the spouses and children ? then there 's a slide down a slope that begins with feelings of confusion , then moves along to anger and then finally , indifference			1
and somewhere in that dark and heavy indifference lies the point of emotional exhaustion where you find yourself standing at the edge of an abyss			0
soothed by the fact that once you jump in , all feelings will end			0
in a 2012 suicide data report , the @entity127 estimated that on average , 22 veterans a day commit suicide			1
the problem is so prevalent that the @entity46 and @entity132 ( @entity133 ) -- which is , in my opinion , the most effective , relevant and impactful organization representing my generation of veterans -- has made combating suicide their @entity140 priority for 2014			1
why suicide rate among veterans may be more than 22 a day i believe there is a stigma within our society when it comes to seeking mental health care			1
as a result , i fear that many who would benefit from treatment choose to stay silent			0
yet , in an @entity133 survey , 77 % of the veterans who responded said they " sought care when it was suggested that they do so by a friend or family member			1
" opinion : suicide on the homefront in military families so if you know someone who may be struggling , please let him or her know that it 's ok if they 're not ok and there 's no shame in it			1
reach out to them and urge them to seek help			0
because unfortunately , as is the case 22 times each day , that person 's life may depend on it			1
help for veterans and their families is available at the @entity179 24/7			2
call 1 - 800 - 273 - 8255 or send a text message to 838255			0
you can also chat online			0
another option is calling the @entity184 hotline : 1 - 877 - @entity185 ( 838 - 2838 ) .			0
