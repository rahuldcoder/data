-- hamburgers and hot dogs were n't the only things sizzling this @entity4			0
this time of year , triple - digit temperatures are the norm in the @entity7			1
and people in @entity9 , @entity10 and parts of @entity12 who celebrated @entity15 's 237th birthday were n't let down on thursday : highs went well past 100 , as they have for the past week and then some			1
but the @entity17 ? that part of the @entity15 has been in a seemingly endless rinse cycle for much of the past two weeks , beset by rainy day after rainy day			0
those rain clouds , though , took a holiday on thursday			2
the sun came out and so did the heat			2
the @entity24 issued heat advisories through thursday night for parts of four @entity28 states because heat indexes -- how hot it feels , accounting for humidity -- reached or surpassed 100 degrees			1
those conditions became an issue on @entity34 's @entity33 , which is along the @entity35 across from @entity36 and the site of the city 's hallmark july 4th @entity41 concert and fireworks show			2
before 6 p.m. some 120 people had already sought assistance , treatment or evaluation from medical personnel along the @entity33 , said @entity49 chief @entity48			0
the first person seeking help at one of the seven medical tents being run by @entity54 and paramedics came in around 10 a.m. , @entity48 said			0
four people in for heat - related ailments were sent to a local hospital out of abundance of caution , he added			2
the @entity17 could be sweating for a little while longer			0
@entity62 , for instance , is under a heat advisory through saturday			1
the combination of high temperatures and high humidity will make it feel like it 's 95 degrees , which can be dangerous in urban locales that do n't have air conditioning			2
" drink plenty of fluids , stay in an air - conditioned room , stay out of the sun and check up on relatives and neighbors , " the weather service says			0
the @entity17 will be relatively cool compared with what the @entity7 has ahead of it			1
highs in @entity80 are not expected to drop below 108 all week ( though that 's still cooler than thursday )			2
@entity82 will see similarly sweltering conditions , though there 's a " slight chance of showers and thunderstorms " -- a rarity in these parts -- in the middle of next week , according to the @entity24			1
from torrential rains to dangerous droughts folks in the @entity94 and the @entity95 know a thing or two about showers and thunderstorms			1
they got soaked by them all @entity4 , and those wet conditions could persist			0
flood watches are in effect from northern @entity95 south to @entity102 and extend east into states like @entity104 , the @entity105 and most of @entity106			1
they extend through friday , if not longer , in areas that have already experienced days of soaking			0
the wet stuff has prompted communities from @entity111 , @entity95 , to @entity112 , @entity113 , to @entity114 , @entity106 , to postpone their july 4 celebrations , fireworks and all			1
but some did n't let rain , rain and more rain deter them			0
take the thousands who turned out in @entity124 's @entity123 , the world 's largest @entity125 , and ran through an intermittent rain			1
@entity106 's capital should get 3 to 4 inches of rain by the time this weekend 's over , according to @entity0 meteorologist @entity131			1
while much of the @entity106 had been mired in drought for years , that 's not the case this year thanks to months like the last one , when about 10 inches of rain made it @entity124 's fourth wettest june ever , said @entity131			1
extreme to exceptional drought conditions persist east of the @entity138 , according to the @entity139 , which is a partnership of the @entity142 's @entity141 , the @entity15 @entity143 and the @entity144			0
the worst conditions hold in parts of @entity147 , @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity10 and @entity9			1
the latter is the site of the @entity153 about 75 miles northwest of @entity82 , where 19 firefighters died this week trying to curb the blaze			0
@entity156 has n't been cooperating , with temperatures soaring into the high 90s and winds gusting stronger than 20 mph once again thursday			0
but there could be good news coming , at least : the thermostat is forecast to peak in the 80s through the weekend			0
and there 's a 10 % to 30 % chance of showers and thunderstorms over that stretch -- though lightning from those storms could spark yet more fires			2
@entity0 's @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 and @entity0 meteorologist @entity174 contributed to this report .			0
