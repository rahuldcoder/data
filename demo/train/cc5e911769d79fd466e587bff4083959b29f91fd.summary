-- for a championship with a distinctly @entity4 streak , it is no surprise that @entity6 should be high on @entity8 's list of territories to conquer			1
this weekend its hordes land in @entity12 for the third round of the 2014 season			1
this vast nation is not entirely unfamiliar with top - class motorcycle racing , but this is still very much the case of an old friend arriving unexpectedly from out of town			0
the last time @entity12 fans heard the roar of grand prix bikes was in 1999 , when current champion @entity24 was just six years old			1
nevertheless , enthusiasm for the sport in these parts is clear			0
spectators will be traveling to the circuit in @entity30 , many by motorcycle , from across the country			0
back in march , as @entity24 and co. lined up on the grid for the season 's opening race in @entity38 , 65,000 tickets had already been sold			1
the grandstands around this redesigned and redeveloped circuit -- crafted by @entity42 @entity41 -- are expected to be full			0
" they have done a brilliant job , " @entity43 , ceo of @entity8 's commercial rightsholder @entity44 , told @entity0			1
" we felt a very warm welcome since the first time we started negotiating with them			2
" after a protracted absence the @entity52 believes the time is right for the series to return to @entity6 , with @entity12 having met the required standards of motorcycling 's ruling body the @entity57			1
" there is interest in @entity8 in this country , and a circuit and track at the best level possible , with @entity57 homologation , and with the government of @entity30 completely committed and involved in the project , " said @entity43			1
" @entity12 is a country that deserves to have @entity8			1
" one thing that should make this weekend 's racing particularly intriguing is the fact that the @entity71 circuit is unfamiliar to all of the riders			1
" this is a new circuit for everyone and we have to interpret it well , " said @entity74 's seven - time world champion @entity73 , who was second at the season - opener in @entity38			1
" we 'll have to understand as soon as possible the ideal setup of the bike , and above all we 'll have to understand how the tires behave on this asphalt			0
" @entity73 's teammate @entity87 , among the favorites for the title after running @entity24 to the wire last year , is anxious to repair the damage wrought by a nightmarish start to his campaign			1
after crashing on the first lap in @entity38 , the @entity52 compounded his misery with an extraordinary false start at the year 's second race in @entity95 , @entity96			1
lined up on the grid , he had apparently been distracted by mosquitoes on his visor , and sped away before the lights turned green			0
it was a bizarre and costly error , which was punished with a ride - through penalty , and his 10th - place finish cast him adrift of the championship leaders after just two races			2
" it 's not easy to swallow what happened at @entity95 but i always try to get the positive thing even if we are in trouble , " the 2010 and 2012 world champion said before traveling to @entity12			1
" staying on track is the best way to forget and i think our championship is going to kick off over there			0
" @entity87 has spent the last fortnight resting and training in the @entity118 resort of @entity119			1
" i will arrive with plenty of energy , " he said			0
one rider who wo n't be making the trip is @entity125 's @entity124 , who is recovering from a painful crash at his last outing			2
after dislocating and breaking a finger the @entity128 had a pin inserted in the bone and will stay home for treatment			0
" i 'm very sad to let the team down like this because i was really looking forward to racing , " he said			0
" unfortunately i 'm still feeling too much pain in my right hand			0
" across the @entity125 garage , however , @entity138 is still on a high after a surprise third - place finish in the @entity142 " when you are able to obtain these results , which seem almost impossible , it is truly a great feeling , " said the @entity42 , who is relishing the chance to maintain his momentum in @entity12			1
" i always like to race on new circuits and so i am very curious and motivated			0
" @entity43 is delighted by the apparent buzz among the riders as they step into the unknown			0
" the whole paddock is excited because it 's a new track , " he said			2
" having a new track is motivation , and especially we want to see the feedback of the riders			0
the ones who were testing here in july were totally happy and satisfied with the circuit			0
i also want to see the response of the fans			0
" @entity166 's two riders , @entity24 and @entity167 , are also feeling pretty satisfied with life			1
after finishing just behind his victorious teammate in @entity95 , @entity167 has been studiously preparing for this weekend			2
" i 've tried to do some homework with maps and videos and find our as much as i could before arriving , " he said , " but it 's hard to say something not being on the bike			2
" @entity24 , whose dominant performances in the opening rounds were all the more remarkable given that he was recovering from a broken leg , is oozing confidence			1
" we will be looking to continue the momentum from the first two races , " the 21 - year - old said			1
few would bet against him doing so			0
in spite of @entity166 and @entity24 's apparent iron grip on the lead , @entity185 is satisfied with the start of this year 's championship , and believes the new open class rules have been a success so far			1
" the regulations were created to reduce the costs and increase the spectacle , and i think we have accomplished these things , " he told @entity0			0
" i 'm sure in the future races this season we will have some spectacular battles on track			2
" as far as the @entity8 circus itself is concerned , @entity43 indicated that the series may look to extend its reach into more new territories before too long			2
" we would like to expand in @entity6 , as well as @entity208 , " he said			0
" @entity209 is interested in hosting a @entity8			2
" the @entity8 chief also hinted that an @entity212 grand prix may be a possibility			2
the last top - class race on the continent was held a decade ago , at @entity217 's @entity216 in 2004			2
" i would like to have a grand prix in @entity217 , as we did in the past , " added @entity43			0
" i ca n't predict the future , but i would like to have a race there and it 's always good to open new frontiers ; but right now it 's very difficult to predict what 's going to happen in @entity217			0
" fans and administrators alike will also be hoping for some unpredictability this weekend in @entity12 ; @entity166 's challengers need to take advantage of this new frontier .			1
