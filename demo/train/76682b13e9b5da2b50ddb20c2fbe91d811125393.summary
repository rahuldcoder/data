-- this week 's announcement that @entity2 is hiring away @entity4 executive @entity3 as its latest ceo has been met by both @entity6 and the tech industry with yawns or worse			1
yawners cite the fact that @entity2 -- by all measures , a company that has been in decline for some time -- has hired five ceos in as many years			2
the fanfare with which they are brought in is matched only by the size of the failure they leave in their wake			0
those who are excited about the new appointment seem to care less about what it means for @entity2 or the internet than the fact that @entity28 is a woman , pregnant , and a former girlfriend of @entity4 chief @entity31			1
tech : know @entity2 's @entity3 in 11 facts but the real story here , the part that no one seems to want to talk about , is that @entity28 could breathe life not just into this failing company , but into the @entity39 itself , which seems to have gone out of favor in @entity41 , where " social " is the only mantra			1
in fact , the very morning i learned that @entity28 had been snatched from @entity4 to @entity2 , i got a special notice on my igoogle screen : @entity47 , the @entity4 web portal i had been using for the past two years , was going to be retired			1
a web portal is simply a starting screen -- a customizable dashboard from which one gets the gist of what 's going on elsewhere on the @entity26 , such as summaries of news headlines , weather forecast , stock quotes , sports scores , e-mail headers , and so on			0
for many of us who use our web browsers to peruse and pursue information , it 's a very convenient " place " to use as a starting page			0
tech : how can @entity2 be saved ? @entity28 was largely responsible for the igoogle page and the ease with which users could install or even create " modules " for it			1
the @entity39 was her turf at the company , and she developed tools such as @entity77 and google maps -- the kinds of web - based technologies that successfully competed with and overtook the once dominant @entity2 in that space			1
but as @entity4 struggles to compete with @entity82 , @entity83 and the @entity84 , the @entity39 no longer seems to be where the action is			1
true enough , when we 're using our smartphones we 're much less likely to be thumbing through a tiny browser than to be engaging with people and information through individual apps like @entity93 or @entity94			0
the whole notion of " places " online has given way to streams and flows of information that follow us ( sometimes even through @entity101 ) wherever we happen to be			0
opinion : what signal is @entity3 giving to @entity2 employees ? so it 's not surprising that in its desperate efforts to beat the @entity84 with @entity107 , @entity82 with @entity108 , and @entity83 with , well , something to come , @entity4 would look back on the @entity39 and its portal as last decade 's war			1
companies usually fail by sticking with obsolete technologies ( like landlines and photographic film ) instead of moving into the future			0
in an effort to focus on the future and please shareholders , @entity4 is shedding what it sees as obsolete technologies			2
in doing so , however , @entity4 is leaving the web open for @entity2 to reclaim			2
@entity2 already has @entity39 - dominant properties in @entity124 and @entity125 , which both exceed @entity4 's offerings in breadth and usage			1
@entity124 's message boards are brimming with activity			0
@entity4 's are ghost towns			2
@entity132 , the original all - purpose web portal , has always been more functional and user - friendly than @entity4 's			2
on @entity47 , the @entity135 looks generic ; on @entity2 , it retains its characteristic masthead and typeface			2
in spite of all this , however , @entity4 was able to overtake @entity2 's web presence -- largely due to the proliferation of @entity4 apps and the overwhelming popularity of its web search tool			2
tech : six life lessons from @entity2 ceo i believe @entity4 is abandoning the web at its own peril , and in a misguided effort to compete on the much more ephemeral playing fields of social media and handheld gadgets			1
the @entity39 is not over yet , not by a long shot			0
on the other hand , by hiring @entity4 's web visionary -- the very executive who beat them at their own game -- @entity2 is double - downing on the @entity39			1
the company may even figure out how to bring the web to smartphones and social media before these newer technologies render browsing obsolete			0
@entity167 , for one , am glad @entity2 somehow stuck this out			0
no matter how pervasive and ubiquitous computing gets , most of us still need locations and frameworks to orient ourselves in cyberspace			0
living : if @entity28 can have it all , can you ? @entity2 was the first and best at creating this sense of place , and now it stands on the brink of becoming the dominant player once again , simply by staying put			1
working moms : do you have any tips maintaining your career and raising a child ? share your story with @entity187			0
