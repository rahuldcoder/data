-- at long last , the ' 60s tv series " @entity2 " is finally being released on dvd and blu - ray			1
fans of the @entity6 and @entity8 program have been waiting years for this moment , as a long - running rights dispute between @entity11 and @entity12 ( the latter is @entity0 's parent company ) made it seem like it would never come			0
before november 11 , anyone hankering for classic " @entity2 " had to settle for recording episodes from cable on the dvr			1
when " @entity2 " made its tv debut in 1966 , it was nothing short of a phenomenon			1
the first episode had huge ratings and launched a slew of bat - merchandise as the dynamic duo invaded the public consciousness , appearing just about everywhere for much of that year			0
for a time , the show had people tuning in the following night -- " same bat - time , same bat - channel " -- to see how @entity2 got out of their latest jam			1
up until @entity36 's 1989 movie , the 1966 version of " @entity2 " was the best - known representation of the hero , and it 's still fondly remembered nearly 50 years later			1
here are five of the most memorable moments of the series , which ran from 1966 to 1968			1
( we 're not counting @entity6 and @entity8 's tongue - in - cheek performances , which are in a league of their own			0
the @entity47 right out of the gate , we knew we were in for something special			0
as @entity2 went into a nightclub ( with the underage @entity52 waiting outside ) , he happened upon the @entity54 's girlfriend , @entity53			1
as the pair danced , @entity2 unleashed some moves of his own , and the @entity47 was born ( soon to be replicated in " @entity57 " )			1
@entity58 faces the dynamic duo @entity61 's first performance as the @entity58 three weeks into the series stands as one of its best episodes			2
here we saw the @entity58 break out of jail , erect a statue of himself , pose as @entity68 and more ( in a plot based on one of the classic comic book issues )			0
it was a tour de force , and he was the first actor to turn the @entity58 into the role of a lifetime			0
the window cameos when celebrities were n't able to be " special guest villains , " they ended up popping out of a window as @entity2 scaled the side of a building			1
everyone from @entity83 to @entity84 to @entity85 turned up there			0
catwoman and @entity2 's neverending flirtation try as she might , @entity87 ( played at various times by @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 ) never could seduce @entity2 into a life of crime			1
and boy , did she try			0
and here 's @entity2 taking on @entity87 's henchmen , because no list is complete without a little " pow ! @entity99 ! @entity100 ! " 5			2
@entity101 arrives by season three , the show was on the brink of cancellation and introduced @entity105 , a.k.a. @entity101			2
@entity106 -- the first actress to portray a female superhero on live - action tv -- breathed new life into the show for a short time , but sadly , @entity112 pulled the plug as that season ended			2
( legend has it that it was too late for @entity118 to pick up the show			0
) of course , it 's tough to narrow it down to five ( and the less said about that surfing contest , the better )			0
