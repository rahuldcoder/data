-- on tuesday night , it will be time to meet the candidates			2
there will be a @entity5 presidential debate , this one hosted by @entity0 , the @entity6 and the @entity7			2
this is the 14th televised debate , depending on how you 're counting ( there was that two - person debate between @entity12 and @entity13 ) , since they began back in may			0
for generations we have taken it for granted that the way we meet our would - be presidents is on television			1
but , of course , it was not always so			0
for a good portion of the existence of the @entity27 , the process of choosing a president must have felt like trying to decipher a distant and indistinct rumor			1
" every generation , because of advances in communications technology , thinks that it knows the candidates , and the president , better than the generations that came before , " said @entity29 , chairman of the department of political science at @entity32 and co-director of the @entity34			0
" but of course , it all comes down to the question : even when we think we know a candidate , or a president , what do we really know ? " think of the earliest days of the @entity27 -- and the earliest elections			1
pamphlets , handbills , seventh - hand retellings of speeches the teller may or may not have actually heard ... the first ( and second and third and beyond ) generations of @entity27 elected as president men who , if they had passed them on the street , they might not have recognized			1
@entity29 believes that readers of @entity27 newspapers in those days devoured them with a level of gratitude unfamiliar today : " reading the paper was seen as a treat -- today , there is so much information , on the @entity68 and everywhere else , that it overwhelms people			1
but readers eagerly looked forward to reading the papers back then , because that was their best chance to learn about the world			0
" most people today take it for granted that a president will be a constantly televised visitor in their homes -- it has never been any other way for them			0
but more than 70 percent of all @entity27 presidents served in the years before television sets were first installed in homes			1
@entity83 was the first president to appear on tv the way we know it ( although @entity87 took part in a television experiment at the 1939 @entity90 )			1
more than 60 percent of our presidents were never heard on radio ; @entity93 , who entered office in 1921 , was the first to speak on commercial radio			1
the voice of @entity97 , as large as he loomed in the @entity27 mind , was never heard in @entity27 homes when he was in the @entity100			1
what in our era that would be unthinkable -- a president who did not regularly speak to us -- was , to @entity27 of a century or so ago , just a fact of life			1
@entity108 was the first president whose voice was recorded			0
the first to be filmed was @entity111 , who took office in 1897			0
before @entity111 , presidents appeared to the public only in still photographs			2
and almost a quarter of our presidents did n't have their pictures taken while in office or running for office			2
@entity121 is widely believed to have been the first ; @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , @entity127 ... the @entity27 they led had no opportunity to see , photographically , what they looked like			1
in that era , voters could view their presidents and would - be presidents through reproductions of oil paintings of heroic - looking figures ( put forth by the men themselves ) or crude and insulting cartoons ( put forth by their opponents )			1
all of this has little to do with the presidents -- they had no control over the technology of their times -- and everything to do with the citizens			2
it always has been such a leap of faith , deciding who is deserving of one 's vote			2
for all the media manipulation that goes on in the television age , consider the mischief that could be done in the era when presidents and candidates went largely unheard and , before that , unseen			1
the day is probably coming -- perhaps soon -- when some long - shot candidate will make a promise that , if elected , he will wear a tiny live video camera in the lapel of his suit jacket , so that @entity27 , in real time on their computer screens and telephones , can see and hear everything that he is seeing and hearing in the @entity100 , from his vantage point			1
( and if elected , he will quickly announce that for reasons of national security , he wo n't be able to use the lapel camera much , after all			0
) the leap of faith is the same as ever			0
we have to tell ourselves that we know our presidents , even if we 've never met them			2
no @entity27 ever saw @entity178 talking live on television ; no @entity27 ever heard @entity180 speaking on the radio ; no @entity27 ever heard @entity183 's recorded voice			1
@entity184 ? no @entity27 ever saw a photo of him			1
yet they all had to find a way to appeal to the entire country -- to get the majority of the nation to declare : he 's the one			2
every four years , we roll the dice anew			0
do we truly know the people who would be president any better now than our ancestors did when they had never seen the candidates ' faces or had any idea what their voices sounded like ? of necessity , each generation evaluates a candidate -- and a president -- based on what the voters have available at the time			0
@entity32 's @entity29 said that we sometimes forget the specifics of that and the limitations			2
" before microphones , the candidate with a booming voice had a great advantage , " he said			0
when candidates had to speak to large crowds without the benefit of a microphone , a person with a quiet voice did n't even stand a chance of reaching the crowd and having his words heard			0
" in the end , though , according to @entity29 , all campaigning through various forms of media provides only a rough facsimile of what the person asking for votes is like			0
" imagine if every person in the country was somehow able to have a five - minute meeting with a candidate for president , " he said			0
" just the two of them , alone			0
i think we all would have a very different feeling about who we 're voting for			0
i think that would change everything			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity246 .			1

@entity27 think they know their presidents because they are always present on tv
@entity246 : for much of @entity27 's *history* , access to presidents was very limited
before radio and television , presidents were distant figures , more written about than seen
