@entity0 -- hundreds of demonstrators were in the streets thursday in locales around @entity6 , inspired by uprisings elsewhere in the region as they railed against the government 's inability to provide basic services and complained of food , water and power shortages , officials said			1
the biggest demonstration took place in @entity17 , a relatively poor town in a heavily @entity20 region about 200 kilometers ( 125 miles ) south of @entity0			1
two @entity6 interior ministry officials -- who , per policy , did not speak by name due to security concerns -- estimated that that nearly 1,000 people participated			2
the protesters walked toward a local council building , trying to force their way in as they hurled rocks inside the compound and at police outside , the @entity27 officials said			1
some were heard shouting , " we 've had enough " and " where are your promises			0
" @entity6 police opened fire , ostensibly to disperse the crowd , and wounded three protesters in the process , the officials said			1
four others were hurt while skirmishing with police outside the council building			1
eventually , tribal and civic leaders intervened to end the demonstration , the officials said			0
some of the protesters carried items such as water tubes and oil lanterns to demonstrate a lack of basic services like water and reliable power			1
@entity56 , a protester , said that sewage had flooded the small town 's streets after heavy rain in recent days , and he complained that " the government has n't done anything to solve it " even though it happens every year			0
" we 've suffered a lot from bad services in the town , " @entity63 , a 50 - year - old protester , told @entity1			2
" one government comes and another leaves , and nothing has changed in this town for decades			0
" dozens of protesters in @entity74 , part of another predominantly @entity20 province about 110 kilometers south of @entity0 , thursday demanded the resignation of @entity79 's provincial governor , @entity78 , according to a @entity79 police official and an @entity27 official			1
these were the latest in a string of demonstrations around @entity6 , mostly emphasizing the same themes -- low - quality public services and a dearth of basic commodities			1
that was the case monday , when dozens of protesters took to the street in northern @entity0 's @entity91 district			1
a day earlier , nearly 200 @entity6 demonstrated in two locations in @entity0 to show solidarity with those in @entity96 rallying against their president @entity97 and to criticize their own leaders			1
they included about 100 people who gathered in @entity101 in the city center , near where @entity104 troops in 2004 pulled down a giant statue of former dictator @entity107			0
they referenced what was happening in @entity96 , as well as their hope that their own government would take steps to improve @entity6 ' security , increase basic services and pursue policies to create more jobs			1
figures compiled by @entity6 's @entity120 ministries indicate that 259 people -- 159 civilians , 55 police and 45 soldiers -- were killed in january 2011			2
the figures also show that 363 people were wounded in january -- 178 civilians , 95 police and 90 soldiers			2
meanwhile , @entity6 's national unemployment rate is around 45 %			0
" we have suffered more than any other country in the past eight years , and it is time for @entity6 's government to take serious steps to end our suffering , " said one demonstrator , @entity129			0
" we are here to support our brothers in @entity96 , but also to give a message to @entity6 politicians and to the @entity6 government that @entity6 are losing patience			0
" elsewhere in @entity0 on sunday , another 100 people rallied just outside the heavily fortified @entity141 that houses @entity6 government offices and the @entity104 and @entity144 embassies			1
they , too , called for government to improve basic services and not to evacuate them from government buildings and institutions			2
some carried a coffin draped in a black sheet that read " the share of the @entity6			0
" " we sacrifice our blood and souls for @entity6 , " the protesters shouted			0
@entity6 security forces , from the army and police , sported machine guns as they surrounded the demonstrators			2
some of the protesters said they were emboldened by the overthrow of @entity163 's long - time president , which began after @entity164 , a 26 - year - old college graduate , set himself afire after a police officer seized the goods from his fruit stand			0
that popular uprising has been followed by anti-government demonstrations in @entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 as well as @entity96			0
" of course we have been inspired and what has happened because of a street vendor , who sparked the uprising in @entity179 and now in @entity96 , " @entity173 , one @entity0 protester , told @entity1 .			0

hundreds protest in @entity17 , an @entity6 town , over a lack of basic services and shortages
7 are wounded in *confrontations* with police outside a council building , officials say
dozens also demonstrate in the central @entity6 city of @entity74 , according to officials
