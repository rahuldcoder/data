the inquiry by the @entity25 and prosecutors was announced monday			0

in november , seven teenagers were arrested in connection with what authorities said was the racially motivated stabbing death of 37 - year - old @entity35 of @entity36 , @entity0			1
all seven were charged with gang assault , and the alleged leader of the attack was charged with manslaughter			0
@entity43 's death drew national attention			2
" we became involved because we thought that the charges filed originally by the police department did not meet with the facts of the case , " said @entity45 , president and general counsel of @entity0 - based @entity47 : specifically , that the youths were not charged with murder			1
latinojustice @entity47 , founded in the early 1970s as the @entity47 , petitioned the @entity3 to investigate @entity9 police			1
@entity43 's stabbing also prompted the @entity56 to undertake an investigation in @entity9			2
after four months of research and interviews with more than 70 @entity21 immigrants , 30 local religious leaders , human rights activists , community organizers and small business owners , the center said in a report last month that a pattern of ethnic intolerance was clear			1
" the @entity43 murder , while the worst of the violence so far , was hardly an isolated incident , " the report said			0
" @entity21 immigrants in @entity9 are regularly harassed , taunted , and pelted with objects hurled from cars			1
they are frequently run off the road while riding bicycles , and many report being beaten with baseball bats and other objects			0
their houses and apartments are egged , spray - painted with racial epithets and riddled with bullets in drive - by shootings			0

they have done good work over the years , but to be honest with you , this is sloppy work			0
many of the allegations are incorrect and inaccurate			2
