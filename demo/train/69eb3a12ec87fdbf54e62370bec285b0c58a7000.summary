@entity1 , @entity0 -- even when pared down to just its interactive portion , @entity5 can feel like a huge and amorphous thing -- sort of like , as director @entity7 says , the internet itself			1
this tech - themed gathering has exploded in the years since the term " dotcom billionaire " became a career goal for any 20 - something with a computer and an idea			1
the interactive portion of the festival now draws more than 30,000 people each year , more than both the original music portion of the festival and @entity5 's older cousin , @entity23			1
with that growth has come some meaningless noise			0
if you wanted to see a grown man in black fingernail polish swing on a wrecking ball like @entity30 or hear a big - money venture capitalist attempt to rap onstage with @entity32 this week , you could			1
but beneath the noise , there 's still a lot of signal			2
all - night parties and desperate sales pitches aside , @entity5 is still where some of the digital world 's smartest people come to talk about ideas that will guide agendas for years to come			1
it 's where trends crystallize and where nascent startups take flight			2
and even at a disparate festival whose offerings ranged from wrestling superstar @entity52 extolling the virtues of the online @entity54 to a discussion about how virtual reality may become a life - saving medical tool , some themes did emerge			1
here are five of our takeaways from @entity5			1
no new @entity62 ... and that 's ok from a tech perspective , @entity5 's " greatest hit " was @entity62 , the social network that came to the show in 2007 with a small core of support and left on the back of a hype rocket that , 240 million users later , helped make it part of the public 's consciousness			1
in the years that followed , a handful of social startups like @entity79 and @entity80 earned more modest " @entity83 bumps			2
" but , since then , the clamoring throngs of app creators in @entity1 have failed to produce a breakout			1
and , this week , it felt like fewer were even trying			2
" i think that social media has become so baked into everything we do that the revolution has plateaued a little bit , " said @entity7 , the @entity5 director			1
" @entity62 was our big moment , " he added			0
" but i also think , at this point , it 's our biggest albatross			2
( observers now always ask ) ' why is n't there a @entity62 this year ? ' " yes , plenty of entrepreneurs were promoting their products at @entity5 this week , and that 's not going to stop			1
but the more expectations fade for a new tech superstar to emerge , the more folks can enjoy seeing innovations without having to wonder whether every single one of them is the " next big thing			0
" a crossroads for privacy in 2014 , many of us have adopted a perhaps oversimplified but nonetheless handy approach to online privacy : assume you do n't have any , and do n't post anything you do n't want the whole world to see			0
some tech titans , like @entity120 's @entity119 , have argued that we live in a post-privacy age			1
but online privacy , particularly from the all - seeing eye of the world 's governments , still has its champions , and some of the world 's most visible spoke at @entity5			1
@entity130 leaker @entity129 and @entity132 founder @entity131 both appeared remotely : assange from an embassy in @entity135 and @entity129 presumably from @entity136 , where he fled with state secrets he stole while working as a government contractor			0
both called on tech - savvy attendees in @entity1 to create products that help web users hide their activity from prying eyes			1
" @entity5 and the tech community , the people in the room in @entity1 , they 're the folks who can fix this , " @entity129 said			1
" there 's a political response that needs to occur , but there 's also a tech response that needs to occur			2
" meanwhile , entrepreneurs and marketers at @entity5 were discussing the best ways to make money off their users ' data			2
the tech community , like the world at large , is at an online - privacy crossroads			2
which way the momentum will shift remains to be seen			0
gadgets galore until recently , interactive week was about apps , websites and ideas			0
the shiny things that blink and buzz and flash belong at the @entity174 in @entity175 or the @entity176 in @entity177 , thank you very much			0
but , this year , there was a visible uptick in the number of places @entity1 - style innovation was merging with cutting - edge hardware			1
a drone used a taser - like stun gun to knock some guy off of his feet			0
" @entity190 " fans used a virtual - reality headset , the @entity191 , to immerse themselves in a @entity193 version of a scene from the fantasy series			0
rows of 3 - d printers were everywhere you looked , and although they had more " gee whiz " appeal last year , it was interesting to see the technology continue to evolve			2
( one of our favorites ? 3d - printed candy from a machine built in partnership with @entity209			0
) there were developers showcasing wirelessly connected homes that memorize and accommodate your habits			0
the trend extended all the way to street teams hawking e-cigarettes , or " digital vapor cigarettes , " as the new ones are being called , because " e-cigarette " is so 2013			0
but nowhere did hardware and innovation merge more visibly at this year 's festival than in ... wearable tech this trendy gear was so front - and - center at @entity5 this week that it deserves its own category			1
wearable technology -- gadgets on your body , such as fitness trackers -- was a standing - room - only event at @entity5 's @entity235 , where new companies pitch their products to investors in the hopes of attracting funding and press			1
one startup demoed solar - paneled clothing that can recharge a phone in two hours			0
another pitched @entity246 , a wristband that authenticates users through their unique cardiac rhythm and eliminates the need to type passwords on a mobile device			0
but the big winner was @entity254 , an augmented - reality motorcycle helmet			0
the helmet has a 180 - degree rear - view camera that projects images to a headset display so the driver can see the road in every direction			0
the company 's ceo , @entity263 , describes his product as " like @entity266 , except it can save your life			0
" and speaking of @entity266 , seeing people walk around @entity1 in @entity271 's connected eyewear was so commonplace that no one even bothered to look twice -- a rarity outside the @entity274			1
foreign flavor it was impossible to grab a bite or a beer in downtown @entity1 this week without hearing animated conversations in languages other than @entity281			1
more than ever , the festival is becoming an international affair , reaffirming how the digital revolution has spread far beyond @entity285			2
people from a record 74 countries attended @entity5 this week , up from 55 last year			1
@entity7 said the influx of international visitors reflects the growth of the global startup scene			0
more than 70 businesses were represented at @entity293 , a gathering space sponsored by @entity296 's business community			0
@entity299 , @entity300 , @entity301 , @entity302 ... those are just a handful of the other countries that had a @entity5 presence , official or otherwise			1
@entity120 's recent $ 19 billion purchase of @entity308 , the messaging service , heralds what 's likely to be a recurring theme			0
as digital markets mature in the @entity314 , the tech world will be increasingly looking at services , like @entity308 , that have huge numbers of overseas users			0
as usual , @entity5 is a nice condensed look at the bigger trend .			2

the @entity5 festival just *wrapped* in @entity1 , @entity0
