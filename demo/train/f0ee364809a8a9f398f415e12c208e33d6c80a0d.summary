-- election tension is boiling over ; it seems like everyone from the office blowhard to the person in front of you at the post office is spouting off opinions that make your blood boil			0
but what happens when the one disagreeing with you shares your bedroom ? here are ten tips to help you make it to november 4 without resorting to the taser gun : 1			0
assess the situation : while one of you might not care that much , the other might be eating , drinking , and sneezing the party line			1
acknowledge who feels most strongly , who 's just having fun , and whether or not thoughtful discourse is as likely as pigs ( with or without lipstick ! ) flying			0
find common ground : establish that you each are trying to do what you think is best to move this country forward			1
maybe you can even agree on an issue or two , and join forces in talking about your mutual passion			0
( note : this becomes less effective if you see eye - to - eye only about oatmeal tariffs			0
establish boundaries : maybe it 's no political talk at the table or no ranting email forwards from @entity44			1
you might even agree that you 'll freeze discussion if one of you cries for mercy ( a " safe " word is good for this : who knew that political arguments were so much like @entity53 ? ) either way , ground rules are essential to keep things from getting ugly			1
@entity58 - @entity57 : now 's the time to channel your inner @entity60			1
offensive taunts , passive - aggressive digs and -- most certainly -- flying fondue pots are all out of the question			1
do n't overpersonalize : your beloved is still , for the most part , who he always was			1
and the vast majority of those qualities have nothing to do with who gets his hanging chad in the voting booth			0
drive to distraction : now is the time to take up cooking together , not to spend all night with @entity79			1
choose a classic movie over debate analysis and your 80s playlist over talk radio			1
and do n't even think of bringing your guy to that fundraiser ! 7			2
find your outlet : if it helps you to hang out in partisan chat rooms all day , have at it			2
just make sure you know the difference between blowing off steam and getting yourself worked up , or you 're liable to be worse off than you started			2
keep it out of the bedroom : say good night without politics -- unless , of course , the conflict adds some spice ! but ixnay on the bouffant wig and red glasses ...			0
as well as the @entity104 undies			0
make an election night plan : whether you 'll be at viewing parties in opposite cities or side - by - side with earpieces and laptops , agree in advance whether you 'll spend the evening , and morning , together			0
avoid the potential pitfall of letting the night unfold spontaneously -- after all , one of you will be stewing while the other is squealing			2
do a reality check : for every couple engaged in a playful red - versus - blue showdown , there 's another that must acknowledge red flags about opposing world views			0
do n't minimize what might be a larger problem of philosophical incompatibility -- or it could be a very long four years to come			2

if you 're in a mixed political party *marriage* , this could be a tense time
find common ground or avoid political battles over *dinner* table
do n't hurl taunts or forward political e-mail rants from @entity44
choose classic movie over talk radio , perhaps take up cooking class
