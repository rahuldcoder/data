-- to be a champion you must win a title -- but to become a @entity5 legend you must win races at @entity7			1
" @entity7 is very special -- it is magical , " @entity8 , a four - time winner at @entity5 's most prestigious grand prix tells @entity0 's @entity11 series			1
" you can be a great driver without winning at @entity7 but it is much better to have won here			1
" only three men have triumphed in the principality more often than @entity8 -- his great rival @entity16 took six victories , while @entity18 and @entity19 claimed five each			1
" if you want to be considered as a great , very often you 'll hear people say , ' oh , i know @entity8 is a world champion but he won at @entity7 four times and @entity16 has won there six times , ' says the @entity24 , who ended his career with four world titles compared to the late @entity27 's three			1
" you always operate within your parameters			0
i won the @entity24 @entity30 six times and nobody cares about that , " he adds			2
" it is always more important to win at @entity7			2
" first run in 1929 and a fixture in the @entity5 calendar since 1950 , the @entity7 is the most glamorous race in the @entity5 calendar			1
home to some of the world 's richest and most famous celebrities -- including many sports stars -- because of its favorable tax laws , @entity7 plays host to some of the biggest names in the racing world			1
the picturesque city - state on the @entity49 has been transformed this week to accommodate 200,000 fans all aiming to grab a view of the cars from the grandstands , hotel balconies and terraces -- as well as the luxury yachts moored in the harbor			1
the course , which is overseen by the @entity59 , requires two months to complete and calls on the expertise of 200 construction workers to build 1,100 tonnes of grandstands , 900 tonnes of pit garages and 21 miles of safety barriers			0
@entity8 still revels in the excitement that 's generated on race weekend -- something he says is unparalleled across the racing world			1
" first of all it 's a race , but it 's the atmosphere of the whole thing which i enjoy , " the 59 - year - old says			1
" my parents live close to @entity7 , in @entity74 , and i have a lot of friends near too			2
" there 's also the atmosphere , which feels very @entity24 but it 's more than that , it 's the only grand prix where you feel something special			0
" while the circuit at @entity7 is one of the most challenging , it is the demanding nature of life off the track during race week which can often prove more difficult			2
drivers are expected to entertain sponsors , attend parties and galas , while there is the usual pre-race hype to deal with too			0
it is a week unlike any other in the racing calendar			0
practice sessions start a day earlier on thursday , meaning a gap -- often filled by duties to sponsors -- before saturday 's qualifying session			0
" there are a lot of parties at @entity7 and it 's not the sort of place where you can say , ' ok , tonight , i am going to go to sleep and wake up late , ' " @entity8 reveals			1
" you need to stay in good shape and keep your concentration			0
" you can have some parties , but you are always meeting people during the four days in the lead up to the race			2
" the biggest quality you need for this track is concentration and you need that concentration for all four days			0
" @entity122 , a three - time world champion who had more retirements at @entity7 than podium finishes , described negotiating the tricky street circuit as " like riding a bicycle around your living room			1
" but @entity8 , who won there three years in a row from 1984 - 86 , remembers it more fondly			2
" every year , you arrive here , you go into your car , you go up to the @entity134 , you try to accelerate and every time , every year i had the same feeling : ' how am i going to be able to drive this , the car looks so big for the corner and the speed and the power ... ? ' " and slowly you get used to it , in only a few laps , but it looks like you have a plane , you have a jet			2
but you change slowly and you start to dominate the car , and that is when you have the biggest pleasure			0
the only time i had this 100 % control was ' 86			0
" that year he started from pole position , set the fastest lap during the race and headed off his @entity153 teammate @entity152 -- father of current @entity156 star and @entity7 resident @entity157 -- while @entity16 was third			1
but it is his failure to claim victory in 1993 which still nags at @entity162 -- a race where he was hit with a stop - go penalty to deny him yet another success			0
having again started from pole position , he was too quick out of the blocks and then , after serving his punishment , he stalled and dropped to 22nd place			0
despite the circuit being notoriously difficult for overtaking , @entity8 made his way up the field but had to settle for fourth as @entity16 triumphed for @entity153 in what would be his final race at @entity7 -- he died the following year at @entity176 driving for @entity8 's former team @entity178			1
it was also @entity8 's final outing at @entity7 -- he decided to retire at the end of that season			1
" i will never forget that one , " he recalls			0
" that was my win , you know			0
" i would say that i rate all my victories here the same , as they are a part of history			0
" interactive : experience the thrills of @entity7			0
