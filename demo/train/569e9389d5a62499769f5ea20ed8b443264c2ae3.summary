-- the international @entity2 crowd has packed up its tents and menagerie of models in @entity6 and moved on to @entity7			1
after that , it 's @entity10 and finally , @entity11			2
meanwhile those unfamiliar to the @entity14 tents , where runway shows and designer presentations take over the city twice a year , are left wondering in a dust of sequins and a lingering cloud of @entity21 : why all the fashionable fuss ? how does @entity2 impact me and what i wear daily ? " on a strictly business level , it 's a $ 350 million a year business , " said @entity25 , the ceo of the @entity26			1
" it 's the second largest industry in @entity6 after finance			2
it is n't just these design jobs , it 's the retail jobs , it 's the truckers who drive the deliveries around to stores , it 's the editors			2
it 's a big , big business			0
" particularly in @entity6 , @entity2 is more for the benefit of the buyers , or the people who decide what items to stock in department stores or boutiques for the upcoming season			1
from there , @entity2 designs will eventually trickle down into mass market retail			1
garments that debuted on the runway this week may not be hanging from the racks of your local @entity54 anytime soon , but you 'll see their influence in the shades , patterns and cuts of mass produced items			1
if the nearly 200 designers who showcased their lines during @entity2 are any indication , by spring , the masses will be wearing skirt suits , sheer overlays , blush tones , edgy prints , sexy cutouts and head scarves			1
@entity73 , an associate professor of fashion design at @entity75 , said even for consumers who are " just not that into it , " -- it being fashion -- the industry 's influence is unavoidable			0
" whether we like it or not , whether we want it or not , we are constantly bombarded by information , which , of course , includes fashion , " she said			0
" the manufacturers may translate those specific details to more affordable versions that may be trickled down to mass production garments soon after the shows are over			0
being totally oblivious about fashion elements would not exclude the fashion from an uninterested person 's wardrobe , " she said			0
insiders assert the pomp , circumstance and air kisses of @entity2 do n't just matter to the economy and your closet ; they encourage creativity just like events that celebrate any other medium , such as music or fine art. " it 's not just frivolous			1
it 's an entire industry of ideas and marrying the art of commerce with it , " said @entity110 , fashion director for @entity112 magazine			1
and while most runway looks , like the pink feathered @entity120 gown or @entity123 's sequined pants , may seem a little extravagant for the business casual set , @entity125 , @entity25 and @entity73 agree , there 's still a takeaway : silhouettes , textures , colors , tailoring details and ideas on how to accessorize			2
" it 's a presentation of ideas and when thoughtfully put forward the impact can be really wide - reaching , " @entity125 said			0
" it can be whatever it needs to be to a consumer no matter the price point and that person 's personality , " @entity25 said			2
others , like @entity6 - based photographer @entity143 , remain skeptical			0
on thursday , @entity145 will open his latest exhibition , " the @entity148 , " which questions whether @entity2 " has become an anonymous repeating stereotype			1
" still @entity143 acknowledges fashion 's power			0
" @entity2 's goal is to place itself on an aspirational pedestal because it seeks to transform art into commerce			1
as a result , the social reach of fashion is often greater than that of traditional art in today 's society , " @entity143 said			0
