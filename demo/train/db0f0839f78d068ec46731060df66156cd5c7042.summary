-- @entity2 - winning journalist and author @entity1 is never short of a word or two			1
@entity1 : " incredible opportunities masquerading as insoluble problems			2
" the celebrated commentator occupies a position in his profession that many of his contemporaries would rival			2
he gets to go where he wants , when he wants and write about what he thinks , or as he puts it : " i get to be a tourist with an attitude			0
" officially , he 's the @entity17 ' foreign affairs columnist -- a position he 's held since 1995 -- as well as the author of five books			1
through his syndicated column his opinion has become a recognizable @entity24 voice on the international stage , and with it has come a sense of responsibility			1
" i agonize over every column			0
precisely because i know it is going to be read by a lot of people and it 's going to be in @entity31 forever , " he told @entity0			0
" so there is that sense of responsibility , but at the same time you do have to take the attitude of ' this is what i think			0
this is why i think it			0
' i 'm not in a popularity contest			1
" before his current position , @entity1 served in various posts at the @entity17 , including chief economic correspondent , chief @entity45 correspondent and bureau chief in @entity48 and @entity49			2
his reporting from @entity51 in 1983 and work in @entity49 in 1988 won him @entity2 for international reporting			1
taking in the world provides never - ending fascination , he says			1
" i have the best job in the world , i mean , somebody has to have it			2
" he 's recently trained his eye on how @entity24 can reassert itself by leading the way in green technology , encapsulated in his latest book " @entity63 , flat and crowded			1
" as he admits , the environmental aspect is not the point of the book ; really it 's a treatise on how @entity24 " lost its groove and why we need to get it back by taking the lead in the energy revolution			1
" one man who will need to take a pivotal role is the incoming @entity24 president , @entity72 , @entity1 says			1
" i have a lot of high hopes for him			0
i think we are very lucky to have someone with his raw material as the next president			0
i think he brings together several things that we have n't had , " @entity1 told @entity0			0
whether @entity72 can solve the raft of problems he faces is another matter			1
" is he ready to be as radical as the moment ? really have the courage of our crisis ? at the end of the day it 's gon na be @entity72 and ( @entity93 president ) @entity92			1
we 're not going to get out of this without cooperating and working closely with @entity93 , " @entity1 said			0
while presenting a view from the @entity24 , @entity1 is still able to do a mea culpa on @entity24 's behalf when it comes to the current economic crisis			1
" we were in the middle of a huge credit bubble which in its own way was a ponzi scheme			0
we gave the world financial sars			1
we just spread it around the world			2
" an optimist by nature -- " i do live by the motto that pessimists are usually right , but all the great change in history was done by optimists " -- he 's sanguine when it comes to the planet in the current climate of economic depression and environmental urgency			2
" what i 'm basically arguing is that you can look at the world today that is hot , flat , and crowded and you can have one of two reactions			2
one reaction is to say ' we 're cooked , let 's party , ' " he said			0
" that 's not the way i 'd look at it			0
i 'd look at it the way @entity131 , the founder of @entity132 , once described			0
i look at these problems that come from hot , flat and crowded and what i see are incredible opportunities masquerading as insoluble problems			0
