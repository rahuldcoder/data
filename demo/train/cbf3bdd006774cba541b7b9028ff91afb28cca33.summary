-- the @entity2 will talk to @entity3 , but only if the country gets serious about negotiating the end of its nuclear weapons program , secretary of state @entity1 said friday during a visit to @entity9 , a key @entity2 ally			1
" @entity3 will not be accepted as a nuclear power , " @entity1 said after arriving in @entity11			1
his trip to @entity9 -- part of an @entity16 swing that also includes @entity3 ally @entity17 -- came a day after a @entity20 intelligence assessment surfaced suggesting @entity3 may have developed the ability to fire a nuclear - tipped missile at its foes			1
disclosed first by a congressman at a hearing thursday and then confirmed to @entity0 by the @entity20 , the @entity25 assessment is the clearest acknowledgment yet by the @entity2 about potential advances in @entity3 's nuclear program			1
despite weeks of bellicose rhetoric from @entity33 threatening nuclear attacks on the @entity2 , @entity9 and their allies , @entity2 officials have characterized the @entity3 's saber rattling as largely bluster			1
@entity2 officials think @entity3 could test - launch a mobile ballistic missile at any time in what would be seen by the international community as a highly provocative move			1
but a senior administration official said there 's no indication that any such missiles are armed with nuclear material			0
still , the defense agency said it has " moderate confidence " that @entity3 could fit a nuclear weapon on a ballistic missile and fire it			1
but agency analysts think such a missile 's reliability would be low -- an apparent reference to its accuracy			0
@entity56 spokesman @entity55 told reporters friday that the @entity3 government " has not demonstrated the capability to deploy a nuclear - armed missile			2
" and @entity1 said friday that it would be inaccurate to suggest that @entity3 , which has conducted three underground nuclear weapons tests since 2006 , can launch a nuclear - armed missile , despite the @entity25 assessment			1
" but obviously they have conducted a nuclear test , so there 's some kind of device , but that is very different from miniaturization and delivery and from tested delivery and other things , " he said			0
he said any launch by @entity3 would be a " huge mistake			2
" " if @entity78 decides to launch a missile , whether it 's across the @entity80 or in some other direction , he will be choosing willfully to ignore the entire international community , his own obligations that he has accepted , and it will be a provocative and unwanted act that will raise people 's temperature with respect to this issue , " @entity1 said			2
@entity9 foreign minister @entity90 , speaking with @entity1 at a friday news conference , urged @entity3 to open talks			1
" we urge @entity3 to cease its reckless behavior and to stop issuing threats , " he said			2
" instead , we urge @entity3 to respond to our call for building trust on the @entity97 through dialogue , and now it is time for @entity3 to make that choice			2
" a joint statement issued by @entity9 and the @entity2 before @entity1 's departure emphasized @entity104 's commitment to defending @entity11 " in the wake of recent unacceptable provocations " by the @entity3			1
" the @entity2 stands vigilantly by the @entity9 's side , and is prepared for and capable of defending and protecting itself and its allies , " the statement read			1
@entity1 now plans to visit @entity17 and tell leaders there that @entity33 , as one senior administration official said , is " putting @entity17 's own interests at risk			1
" @entity104 wants @entity116 to " stop the money trail into @entity3 " and to carry a strong message to the @entity3 that getting rid of nuclear weapons on the @entity97 is @entity17 's goal , said the official and a senior @entity122 official			2
@entity25 report the surprising @entity25 assessment of @entity3 's potential nuclear capabilities emerged during thursday 's @entity127 hearing			2
at the hearing , rep. @entity129 , @entity130 , read from a declassified version of the document in which the @entity25 expresses " moderate confidence the @entity3 currently has nuclear weapons capable of delivery by ballistic missiles , however , the reliability will be low			1
" as @entity1 did friday , top officials in @entity104 tried thursday to downplay concerns about the report			2
@entity20 spokesman @entity141 said that " it would be inaccurate to suggest that the @entity3 regime has fully tested , developed or demonstrated the kinds of nuclear capabilities referenced " in the @entity25 study			2
that stance was echoed by @entity148 , director of @entity2 national intelligence , who said : " @entity3 has not yet demonstrated the full range of capabilities necessary for a nuclear - armed missile			1
" @entity154 @entity153 ban ki - moon told @entity0 's @entity155 that the agency has no independent information to verify the @entity25 's assessment			0
the @entity25 has been wrong in the past , producing an assessment in 2002 that formed the basis for arguments that @entity162 had nuclear weapons -- a view later found to be incorrect confusion over intel 's release the report was " mistakenly " marked as declassified , according to an administration and a defense source			2
a @entity127 aide said staffers checked with the @entity25 to confirm that the passage was not classified before @entity129 read it			0
@entity129 told @entity0 's " @entity176 " that he acted properly in disclosing it during the hearing			0
" given the seriousness of the threat , this is something that i think people do need to know about , " he said			0
on friday , rep. @entity182 , @entity183 , also backed disclosure of the assessment			0
" i have to believe they know what they 're doing , " said @entity182 , chairman of the @entity127			0
" i think it 's good for the @entity2 people to understand how tenuous this situation is and how important it is for us to have a strong defense			2
" @entity3 missile adjustments on thursday , @entity3 briefly raised a missile into an upright firing position , stoking concerns that a launch was imminent , a @entity2 official told @entity0			1
later , another @entity2 official said it had been tucked back into its launcher			0
that could signify that a much - feared launch by the @entity3 is less imminent			0
it could also mean the government was testing the equipment			0
the first @entity2 official cautioned that raising the untested @entity207 missile , which @entity9 says has a range of up to 2,175 miles ( 3,500 kilometers ) , could have been just a trial run or an effort to " mess " with the @entity2 and its allies			1
@entity3 's missile capabilities the believed range means the @entity207 could reach @entity215 , a @entity216 territory that is home to @entity2 naval and air bases , and where the @entity2 recently said it was placing missile defense systems			1
the @entity2 and @entity9 militaries have been monitoring the movements of mobile ballistic missiles on the east coast of @entity3			1
@entity224 has deployed defense systems			0
@entity148 , the national intelligence director , said thursday at a @entity227 hearing that he did n't think @entity78 had " much of an endgame " other than to get recognition from the world as a nuclear power , which " entitles him to negotiation , accommodation and , presumably , aid			0
" he reiterated that the nation 's " nuclear weapons and missile programs pose a serious threat to the @entity2 and to the security environment in @entity241			0
" opinion : why @entity3 worries @entity243 more threats @entity3 denied responsibility in a wave of cyberattacks on tens of thousands of computers at @entity9 banks and broadcasters last month , the @entity3 's state news agency , @entity245 , reported friday			1
@entity9 this week accused the @entity3 of carrying out the march 20 attacks			1
an official @entity9 investigation found that many of the malignant codes employed in the attacks were similar to ones used previously by the @entity3 , said @entity257 , an official at the @entity9 science ministry			1
a spokesman for the general staff of the @entity261 said the allegations are " groundless " and " a deliberate provocation to push the situation on the @entity97 to an extreme phase , " according to @entity245			0
friday , @entity3 also issued a scathing warning to @entity224 , saying via @entity245 that @entity269 should " stop recklessly working for staging a comeback on @entity3 , depending on its @entity2 master			1
" @entity224 foreign minister spokesman @entity270 said such remarks only hurt @entity3			0
" @entity224 would not be pushed around by rhetoric of @entity3 , " he said			0
late friday , @entity224 's @entity274 issued a notice requiring @entity224 airplanes to report to the @entity2 military if they fly near the @entity2 military 's @entity279 base in @entity282 prefecture , the @entity273 said			0
the notice , made at the request of the @entity2 military in @entity224 , is believed to be part of precautions taken against possible @entity3 missile launches			1
it concerns the airspace within 30 kilometers ( about 19 miles ) of the base in southern @entity224 , where @entity293 missiles are deployed			0
war of words escalates : timeline of a crisis @entity3 began to sharpen its threats in february , after the @entity154 reacted to the country 's third nuclear test with tougher sanctions			0
annual military exercises involving @entity2 and @entity9 troops have added to the tensions			1
at the @entity306 hearing , @entity148 said the @entity2 believed the primary objective of @entity78 's bellicose rhetoric was to " consolidate and affirm his power			0
" earlier in the crisis , the @entity2 drew attention to shows of strength , such as practice missions by @entity317 stealth bombers			0
should i stay or should i go ? expats mull future there @entity1 said friday that @entity2 officials were working to calm the crisis , noting president @entity323 had canceled some of the exercises			2
" i think we have lowered our rhetoric significantly , " @entity1 said			0
