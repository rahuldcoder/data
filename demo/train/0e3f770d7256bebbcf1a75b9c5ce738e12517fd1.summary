@entity0 -- a @entity3 city filed for bankruptcy wednesday , the third in the @entity3 to do so in recent weeks , stoking experts ' concerns that other cities could follow suit			1
the city of @entity13 , with more than 200,000 residents on the eastern tip of greater @entity0 , " filed an emergency petition for @entity11 " with a regional @entity17 bankruptcy court , according to a news release from the city 's interim manager			1
the other two to file recently were @entity21 , with around 300,000 residents , according to 2010 @entity17 census data , and @entity24 , a resort town , where visitors and seasonal residents outnumber the just over 8,000 permanent inhabitants			0
why @entity17 cities are going bankrupt many municipalities in the @entity3 and around the nation are struggling to cover their costs as the economic malaise continues to hurt tax revenue streams , experts said			1
this will lead to more municipal bankruptcies , which have been rare until now			2
" this is not the end			0
this is the beginning , " @entity40 , business professor at @entity41 , told @entity1 recently			0
" as cities see it can be done and is being done , it will give them the idea to do it			2
" @entity47 , an analyst at @entity48 agreed , saying more city bankruptcies are likely in @entity3 and throughout the nation			1
cities have also struggled from budget changes made on the state level			2
because of massive budget shortfalls , gov. @entity54 and the state legislature made changes to vehicle tax money and redevelopment agencies that stripped locales of hundreds of millions in state funding			2
@entity13 said it will continue to provide services during the bankruptcy phase			1
@entity65 city asks retirees to cut their pensions " there will be no immediate service reductions or changes in service to the community as a result of the filing , " interim city manager @entity68 said wednesday			2
but " reductions may occur " in the future			0
in a prior statement @entity68 hinted the city may continue to " negotiate in good faith with its creditors			0
" in early july , @entity68 and finance director @entity82 issued a report stating that the city was facing insolvency and its expenditures were projected to exceed revenues by $ 45 million			1
the city 's general fund reserves had been as high as $ 19 million in 2001 but are now depleted , the report said			1
" the city has reached a breaking point , " the report said			0
some $ 10 million to $ 16 million in annual revenue has evaporated in recent years as taxable sales dried up and property values plummeted in the city , the report said			1
@entity24 sought protection july 2 after a property developer won a $ 43 million court judgment against the resort town			2
experts say this filing should not be lumped in with the other two @entity3 municipal bankruptcies since it was an unusual circumstance			0
@entity21 , however , filed for bankruptcy in late june after three months of mediation when creditors failed to close a $ 26 million budget shortfall			1
the city had already addressed $ 90 million in deficits over the past three years , mainly through reducing services and employee compensation			1
video : declaring bankruptcy in @entity116 both @entity21 's and @entity13 's fiscal troubles are due in large part to the massive housing downturn and recession that swept across @entity3			1
both towns were hit particularly hard by the foreclosure crisis , which left numerous abandoned homes and reduced property values in its wake			0
that led to lower property tax revenues , critical to supporting public services			0
while some areas of the @entity3 are starting to recover , the regions containing those two towns are not , said @entity132 , executive director of the @entity133			0
by filing for bankruptcy , cities will be able to keep police and firefighters on the street and possibly keep some parks and libraries open while they work out their finances , he said			0
@entity143 's @entity142 contributed to this report .			0
