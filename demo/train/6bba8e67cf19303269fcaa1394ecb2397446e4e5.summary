@entity1 , @entity0 -- the @entity3 has a reputation for testing the world 's best golfers with the most demanding courses			1
the 2002 @entity3 at @entity8 featured punishing rough and heavy rain			1
the competition is designed to challenge , traditionally favoring courses that feature brutal rough and narrow fairways			1
this year 's @entity3 is no exception , taking place at @entity8 in @entity16 , @entity17 , widely regarded as one of the toughest courses in the game			1
the @entity3 was first staged at @entity8 in 2002 , when it became the first municipal course to host the competition and , at 7,214 yards , the longest course in the competition 's history			1
those who played at @entity8 2002 still have the scars to prove it			1
heavy rain and swirling wind turned the event into an endurance contest			0
it was survival of the fittest , with @entity36 the only competitor to finish under par , ending the tournament three under			0
those brave enough to return to @entity8 on thursday will find there have been a few changes			1
for starters , the course has been lengthened by 200 yards , which will make the grueling course even more exhausting			0
more welcome will be the introduction of " graduated " primary rough			2
that means there will be a strip of intermediate rough next to the fairway , and beyond that there a strip of primary rough approximately two - and - a - half to three inches deep , followed by a second cut of rough , which will be about four to six inches deep and stretch to the gallery rope lines			2
the idea is to penalize narrow misses less severely than big misses : a player who hits his shot slightly off target will land in the shorter cut of rough , an easier shot than the longer second cut			2

Â» @entity70 , senior director of rules and competitions for the @entity73 , has said the course will be structurally very similar to 2002 , but there will be more " risk and reward " opportunities			0
that means there are more holes where golfers can choose to gamble from the tee			2
a well - executed drive will save strokes and a misplaced drive could cost them dear			0
the sheer length of the course is likely to favor the game 's big hitters			2
that includes the likes of @entity36 , the golfer who most successfully tamed @entity8 in 2002			1
woods also showed his big - course credentials by winning last year 's @entity3 at @entity96 , which topped @entity8 with its 7,643 - yard course			1
the distance the golfers have to cover will probably favor those in good physical condition			2
but the size of @entity8 is not the only thing that will decide the contest			1
graduated or not , the rough will be a real problem , making accurate driving a necessity			0
@entity107 will go into the tournament as one of the favorites , but he will need to be precise from the tee , not one of his strong points			0
patience will be a virtue			0
the fact that it is such a tough course means competitors will have to accept that they will not be able to get under par on many of the holes			0
on the other hand those new " risk and reward " holes will give gamblers the opportunity to throw caution to the wind if they are falling off the pace			0
the golfers and spectators will no doubt be hoping for better weather than in 2002 , but even in glorious sunshine , it will still be the kind of tournament that separates the men from the boys			0
@entity138 golfer @entity137 failed to qualify for the @entity3 last week , but he was full of praise for the course , saying " i love @entity8			1
it 's the ultimate major course			0
it 's so hard they really ca n't make it any harder			0
