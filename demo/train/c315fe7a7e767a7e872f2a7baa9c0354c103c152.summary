-- to most of the world , @entity1 is a soccer player , both hero and goat , at times loved and loathed , depending on which end of his gracefully served free kicks you reside			1
the hullabaloo over @entity1 's arrival on @entity11 shores in 2007 , however , had little to do with the @entity12			1
there is no shortage of @entity11 who see nothing attractive in the sport at all			0
they do n't get it or do n't want to			0
yet @entity1 somehow mattered , if his vocation did n't			0
with the 38 - year - old announcing his retirement thursday , it 's difficult to quantify his ultimate impact on the game in the @entity11 , but it 's safe to say he did n't hurt it			1
a rocky start to the @entity11 leg of his colorful career may have dampened the fanfare with which he landed in @entity33 to play for @entity35 's @entity34 , but he 'd eventually snare two @entity36 before returning to @entity37 to ply his trade			1
" he was still a bit more successful as a celebrity than as a soccer player , which makes sense , because we 're more of a celebrity culture than a soccer culture , " said @entity39 illustrated senior writer and @entity42 analyst @entity41			1
@entity41 , also author of " @entity50 : how the @entity59 tried to @entity60 , " said the @entity53 international 's move from @entity55 powerhouse @entity54 to @entity56 was met with an immediate spike in interest among @entity11			1
becks put butts in seats , and opposing teams would develop marketing plans around him to sell tickets when the @entity34 visited , @entity41 said			1
the results on the field , however , left @entity34 fans wanting , as his first four years were defined by injury , sparse appearances and contentious loan spells to @entity74 's @entity73			1
@entity75 : @entity1 's career - defining moments still , @entity1 's mere presence was enough to increase the attention @entity11 paid to soccer , which has long been a fifth wheel or worse among many @entity11 sports fans			1
" it 's very hard to specifically quantify " what @entity1 has meant to the @entity11 game 's growth , said @entity81 , president of the @entity82 , but several milestones followed his arrival : @entity35 attendance is up , there are more live games -- @entity35 and otherwise -- on television , the @entity34 has become a global brand , and most important , a sport that commanded only a few column inches of coverage 20 years ago now enjoys widespread coverage by the nation 's sports media			1
" @entity1 helped in that			0
he 's certainly given the sport a lot of exposure , " @entity81 said			2
" he increased the visibility of the sport and growth of the game , which was already on a good path			0
" consider , too , these facts : in 2006 , a year before the coming of @entity1 , @entity35 signed an eight - year deal with @entity110 , which brought the league between $ 7 million and $ 8 million annually , according to @entity112			2
a deal with @entity114 for the 2012 - 14 seasons reportedly earned the league $ 10 million a year			0
about 3 million people attended @entity35 games in 2006 , with an average attendance of about 15,500 per game			2
last year , with more teams , the total attendance doubled while the average attendance jumped more than 3,000 per game			0
@entity125 and @entity126 both paid $ 10 million expansion fees to join the @entity35 in 2005 , while @entity128 paid the same amount in 2007			1
the @entity130 , which began playing during the 2012 season , paid $ 40 million			0
there are reports that @entity135 's @entity134 would be willing to pay $ 100 million for his prospective @entity136 to join the @entity35			2
there were only 12 teams in the @entity35 the year before @entity1 arrived			2
@entity139 became the 19th team last year			0
the year @entity1 joined the @entity34 , barely 100 players were making $ 100,000 or more ( @entity142 ) , and only four -- one of them @entity1 -- had a salary of more than $ 1 million , according to the @entity145			1
this year , 240 players made at least six figures ( @entity142 ) , and eight players draw paychecks of $ 1 million or more			0
blame it on @entity1 ? perhaps not			0
it 's a stretch to anoint him " savior of the @entity35 , " @entity41 said			1
the league has n't collapsed since he left for @entity154			0
plus , the @entity35 did a lot to promote the sport on its own -- building soccer - specific stadiums , expanding into the right cities , developing youth players -- while @entity110 helped lay the groundwork with its coverage of @entity162			0
but , @entity41 concedes , " i do think @entity1 is a part of it			2
" i look at what he achieved here			0
it was n't all that different than what @entity168 did when he came in the 1970s to play for the @entity170 , " he said , referring to the @entity166 , which folded in 1984			0
as the best player of all time , @entity168 put a spotlight on the game that perhaps no other player could			0
and while @entity1 , wielder of a deft right foot in his own right , wo n't be mentioned among history 's greatest ever , @entity41 said he believes @entity1 was the biggest celebrity to play the game			1
you look at the world 's greatest athletes -- @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 -- and none carries the cachet that comes with @entity1 , @entity41 said			1
@entity1 was n't even the best player to grace @entity35 , he said			1
the @entity192 ' @entity191 , a @entity194 goal machine who holds every major title for which he 's competed , including the @entity197 that eluded @entity1 , holds that honor			0
but he 's no @entity1 , either , @entity41 said			1
so what is it about @entity1 that makes him so appealing ? @entity81 said he believes it 's that combination of unique player and grand persona that makes @entity206			2
" there 's only one player in the last 20 years that is iconic in the way that @entity1 is , " he said			1
@entity1 is " a pro 's pro , " a guy known for his work ethic , a free kick master who captained @entity53 for six years and won league championships in @entity53 , @entity55 , the @entity11 and @entity194			1
he has a relatively quiet demeanor and lets his action speak more than his words , @entity41 said , and it does n't hurt that he 's married to a @entity220 and is the object of much adoration			0
" i think part of it is , he 's a tremendously good - looking guy who has embraced the positive and negative that comes with being a global celebrity , " @entity41 said			2
" women love the guy			0
" @entity75 : the evolution of @entity1 's hairstyles which explains why he has been found on billboards and in subway stations over the years pimping everything from @entity236 and @entity237 's to @entity238 and his own @entity240 clothing line			2
even his son @entity241 , 10 , is a @entity243 model			0
while it may be difficult to ascertain exactly how @entity1 popularized the @entity11 game or whether his @entity36 or sex appeal were bigger contributions , he certainly spurred @entity11 ' appetite for the sport , if only by being here			1
" his biggest achievement , " said @entity41 , " was signing with the @entity35			2

as @entity1 retires , *experts* say his celebrity *lifted* game in @entity11
his first two years in @entity56 were *abysmal* , but he finished @entity11 career with two @entity36
since he joined @entity34 , @entity35 player salaries , attendance and expansion fees are up
@entity1 is no " savior of the @entity35 , " says @entity262 's @entity41 , but he did a lot to increase exposure
