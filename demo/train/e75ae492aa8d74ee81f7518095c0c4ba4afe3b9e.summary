-- " people should be able to breathe -- to not have to worry about being fired because of their sexual orientation or identity			1
" that seems like a simple enough request , huh @entity6 ? it 's a personal one , too , since it comes from @entity8 , a 28 - year - old who says he was fired in 2010 because his supervisors at a corrections facility in @entity11 found out he 's gay			1
it 's time to ban that discrimination , he told me monday			2
" it 's way , way , way past time			2
" a large majority of @entity19 agree with him			1
in fact , a majority of @entity19 in every state , even conservative @entity11 , support legislation that would ban workplace discrimination against lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender people			1
and that makes perfect sense for exactly one reason : to oppose this legislation , which is called the @entity32 , or @entity32 , is to support the idea that @entity35 people can be fired for being themselves			1
it 's a clear matter of right and wrong , fair and unfair			1
this is n't a @entity39 or @entity40 thing			0
it 's a human thing			2
related : gay people live in 50 @entity43 sure , conservatives will trot out all manner of dated and discriminatory arguments to say the legislation is n't needed or will cause unwanted problems			2
they 'll say , " this is less about tolerance and equality and more about oppressing the freedoms of others			0
" when they do so , they 'll sound to most @entity19 -- to the 70 % or more of us who support this legislation -- like they 're parodying themselves in a " @entity59 " segment			1
whose freedoms , exactly , are being oppressed if a person ca n't be fired for being gay ? and on what planet is freedom increased if someone can be fired , legally , just because of their sexual orientation or gender identity ? we have laws to protect people of different races , religions and disabilities from being fired because of who they are			1
but no federal legislation for @entity35 people			1
a minority of states have passed laws of their own , but why should it be legal for a lesbian in @entity85 to receive no workplace protection when , across a state border , she would have it in @entity88 ? this is an issue the @entity19 people have decided on			1
they know it 's good for business , as @entity95 's ceo argued in @entity96			2
" we 've found that when people feel valued for who they are , they have the comfort and confidence to do the best work of their lives , " @entity97 wrote			2
and they know it undermines who we are as @entity19 , as president @entity109 said this week			1
and it needs to stop , " the president wrote in an op - ed in the @entity114 , " because in the @entity19 , who you are and who you love should never be a fireable offense			1
" related : the county where no one 's gay seems pretty clear - cut , right ? well , @entity6 is still having some trouble			1
sixty - one senators , including seven republicans , voted monday night to bring the bill to the @entity128 floor for debate			0
there , it has a good chance of passing			0
but none of that will matter , really , if the nondiscrimination bill ca n't get past the @entity137			2
also on monday , house speaker @entity138 reaffirmed his opposition to @entity32			1
" the speaker believes this legislation will increase frivolous litigation and cost @entity19 jobs , especially small business jobs , " @entity138 's spokesman said , according to @entity114			1
nevermind that that argument was undermined by a june @entity148 report that found that not to be true in states that already have nondiscrimination laws			0
what 's scary is that @entity138 's opposition to this civil rights legislation could keep it from a vote in the @entity137			0
let 's hope logic and compassion change his mind			0
i know that sounds naive , but stranger things have happened			0
@entity165 , for example , the corrections officer in @entity11 , sued and got his job back			0
he was able to do so because he works for a public employer			0
had he worked for a private company , he might not have been so lucky , attorneys and experts who specialize in @entity35 employment law told me in march when i first reported on @entity165 and his saga			1
related : @entity174 and out in @entity11 he 's back at the job he loves			0
and he 's able to be open with his co-workers about who he is now			0
maybe that sounds like a small thing			0
but think of what it 's like to live in fear that someone at work will find out your secret and then you 'll be out of a job			0
this is what it 's like for gay people in so many states it was the case for @entity165			2
now that @entity165 is openly gay at work , and has legal protection because of his court case , he 's able to be himself			0
" everything at work is great , " he told me			0
it should be that way for others , too			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity208 : @entity6 should pass @entity32
@entity32 would protect @entity35 people from being fired because of who they are
a majority of @entity19 in every state support this *concept* , *surveys* show
@entity206 says it 's a matter of fairness and justice , not *politics*
