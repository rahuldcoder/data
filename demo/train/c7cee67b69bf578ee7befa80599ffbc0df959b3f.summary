editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and website based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is @entity5 's broadband television network			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			0
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- dr. @entity19 performed his first neurosurgery at age 15 on a frog cadaver in high school biology class			1
over the next 50 years , he operated on more than 10,000 brains , one of which accounted for the most ambitious neurological experiment in history : in the ' 70s , he successfully transplanted the head of one monkey to the body of another			1
for @entity19 's efforts , the monkey awoke from the anesthesia and tried to bite his finger off			1
during our interview at his local @entity39 's from which he worked , @entity19 described his most daring research and experimental surgery , as well as the decades of clinical time he devoted to the treatment of brain and spinal cord injuries			1
he published more than 1,000 articles in medical journals and had audiences with four popes in his role as adviser to the papal authority on bioethics			0
although less provocative than his work in the area of organ transplantation , his documentation of the effect of deep cooling on spinal injuries greatly reduced long - term damage of the spinal cord and paralysis			0
this pioneering work has been suggested by some in the neuroscience field as worthy of @entity68 consideration			0
see the rest of " dr. @entity19 's full body transplant " at @entity9 in his most controversial experiments -- more often that not involving the use of dogs and primates -- he successfully isolated the brain			1
as mentioned , he once transplanted the head of a monkey onto the body of another			1
in his estimation , this process , which he referred to as a " whole body transplant , " proved that the brain is truly the repository for human consciousness			2
although the transplant remained viable for only two days before the animal died , future transplants extended the life span of the recipient			2
the issue of the paralysis that results from the severed spinal cord , however , was impossible to avoid and remains one of the largest areas of interest in modern medicine			0
as such , only people with pre-existing paralysis might benefit from this procedure			0
the animal rights movement has of course decried @entity19 's work , most of which was carried out decades ago when animal testing was not as controversial			1
the fact remains , though , that his career in neuroscience helped save countless human lives , even if he euthanized many dogs and monkeys along the way			0
sadly , @entity19 died in september , but his work has left a lasting , wide - ranging influence on conventional medicine that will ultimately be the foundation for countless future scientists .			2

@entity19 's career *included* ambitious , sometimes controversial surgeries
in the ' 70s , @entity19 performed experimental head transplant on monkey
