-- she was getting out of the car one autumn day in 2009 , about to have lunch with a colleague , when @entity5 felt something pop in her neck			1
" it was something so strong i could n't talk for a couple of minutes , " recalls the @entity9 school psychologist			2
but it passed , and she regained her speech			2
the rest of the day and night elapsed normally , but at 9:30 the next morning , as @entity17 finished up a meeting at work , her right arm went numb			2
she went into her office and tried to write a letter , " @entity22			2
" but when she picked up the pen and tried to write the letter " @entity26 , " the pen just slid across the paper			2
@entity17 tried again , but the same thing happened			2
" the 'd ' went crazy , " she said			2
fortunately , @entity17 could still run -- and she did , running the whole length of the school building , seeking a friend who sent her to the school nurse			2
the nurse checked for a pulse in @entity37 's right arm , but found none			2
by the time she reached the hospital 15 minutes later , she could not lift her right arm or leg , speak or understand words			2
@entity17 , at 47 and in near - perfect health , was having a stroke			1
what happens during a stroke the " pop " she felt in her neck the day before was her carotid artery tearing , a rare event called a carotid dissection			1
the carotid artery is the main artery supplying blood to the brain			1
a blood clot formed after the dissection , and a piece of it likely broke off and traveled into an artery in her brain , blocking blood supply and resulting in an ischemic stroke , explained dr. @entity65 , the attending neurologist at @entity66 who treated @entity5			1
ischemic stroke , which results from a blocked blood vessel , is the most common type of stroke and represents about 87 % of all strokes , according to the @entity72			1
hemorrhagic strokes , which involve bleeds in the brain , make up the remainder			2
most of the 800,000 strokes that occur in the @entity79 each year occur among people age 65 and older , the @entity72 says			1
unfortunately , doctors are seeing more and more strokes in younger people , partly because of the continuing epidemic of childhood obesity , early onset diabetes and cholesterol and hypertension issues , said @entity65			0
no one knows why @entity17 's artery tore , especially at such a young age			1
she had not suffered a recent injury , nor did she have any traditional risk factors for vascular disease such as high cholesterol or high blood pressure			0
she may have simply been unlucky -- but after that , she was as lucky as any stroke survivor could be			1
timing is the main factor determining whether a person lives or dies -- or lives with a severe disability -- after a stroke			1
thanks to the alert school nurse , @entity17 made it to the emergency room about an hour and 20 minutes after her first symptoms			0
that left doctors plenty of time to administer the only approved treatment for ischemic stroke -- a clot - busting drug known as tissue plasminogen activator , or @entity116			1
generally speaking , @entity116 is only effective and only given within a 4.5 - hour time window after stroke symptoms appear , said @entity65			1
about an hour after that , @entity17 underwent a procedure in which doctors threaded a catheter through an artery in her groin all the way up into her brain			0
once the catheter reached the clot , doctors squirted more tpa directly into the clot			0
stroke victims do n't call 911 , delay crucial treatment " that dissolved the clot and restored blood flow , " @entity65 said			1
still , no one knew how well @entity5 would recover			0
after the procedure , she was in intensive care			0
the next day , she still could n't speak or understand anything			0
on the second day , when @entity65 asked her to name some simple objects in her hospital room -- a pen , glasses , a watch -- she could not utter the words			0
" she would try , but a jumbled mess would come out , " he said			0
@entity17 had aphasia , a common outcome of stroke in which parts of the brain related to language , including reading , writing and talking , are damaged			1
although some people experience a full recovery from aphasia , others only get part of their previous abilities back			1
how well a person recovers from stroke is highly variable and highly individual , @entity65 said			1
by the third day , though , @entity17 , who was also starting to move her right arm and leg , could name one or two simple items -- and her recovery took off from there			1
she was moved to a rehabilitation facility			0
at first , she made mistakes identifying family and friends , but soon could state who everyone was			0
" that was a big promotion for me , " she said			0
as soon as she got home , she said , she was bossing her husband , @entity178 , and son @entity179 around			0
" i said , ' @entity179 , get the radio off , ' but it was the tv i was talking about , so he said , ' it 's the tv , not the radio			0
' i said , ' ok , get the tv off			0
' @entity17 started driving again and went back to work in early december 2009 , a mere five weeks after her stroke			1
by any standard , she experienced an astounding recovery			1
" it is absolutely remarkable that someone like her had such a severe impairment and then went back to work as a psychologist two months later , " @entity65 said			1
" there are not many people that make recoveries like her			0
" once blood flow was restored , the damaged parts of @entity17 's brain started to " come back on board , " he said			0
later on , different parts of her brain may have rewired for any areas that were permanently damaged			0
today , she shows no evidence of a speech impairment			0
she attributes much of her recovery to determination			1
" i could n't afford to deteriorate , " she said			0
" i had a lot of things in my life lined up and i could n't afford to be in any way less than what i was			0
" robotic system may help stroke patients			1

@entity215 had a stroke in 2009 at age 47
timing is the main factor in determining whether someone survives a stroke
her doctor calls her recovery remarkable ; she says it was determination
