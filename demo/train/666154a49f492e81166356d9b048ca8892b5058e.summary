-- one of the most secretive countries in the world seems to be putting a succession plan into place : @entity6 leader @entity5 promoted his youngest son to general			1
experts say that could be an indication that @entity12 will succeed his father and his grandfather as leader of @entity6			1
the outside world knows very little about @entity12 -- not even his age , which is apparently 27 or 28			0
but at least one person outside the reclusive communist state once considered @entity12 his best friend			2
or at least he thinks so			0
@entity21 went to school in @entity23 with a boy he knew as @entity25 from 1998 to 2001			1
a teacher put them together at the same desk when the new student arrived , and they hit it off			0
then , one day @entity25 told @entity21 , " i am the son of the leader of @entity6			1
" @entity32 " did n't believe him because ... it was a normal school , " he told @entity0 tuesday			1
" normally the children of people like this , they do n't go to a normal school			2
" but having seen pictures of the apparent heir to @entity5 , @entity21 thinks it 's his high school friend			1
he remembered what his friend had told him years before			0
" then i said , " okay , maybe it 's true what he said to me , ' " said @entity21 , who now lives in @entity48 , @entity23 , near the school he attended			1
local government officials in the town that 's home to the @entity53 confirmed a student named @entity25 attended at the same time as @entity21			1
the school declined to speak to @entity0			0
@entity21 remembers " @entity55 " being introduced as the son of the ambassador of @entity6			1
what is life like inside @entity6 ? " he was a normal guy like me , " @entity21 said , interested in sports , movies and computers			1
" he was competitive at sports			0
he did n't like to lose , like any of us			0
for him , basketball was everything , " @entity21 said " he played basketball , he had basketball games on his playstation			1
the whole world for him was just basketball all the time , " he said			2
the @entity6 , who spoke good enough @entity75 to be understood , was not outgoing , @entity21 said			1
" he was very quiet and he did n't speak with anyone			0
maybe it was because most of the people did not take the time to understand him , " he said			0
" and he was not that type of guy who goes to another and says , ' hello , how are you ? ' he was always quiet			0
" he did n't go out at night to parties or discos , but he and @entity32 sometimes talked about girls , his friend said			0
@entity21 went to his house many times , meeting people whom he thought were his friend 's parents			2
but they spoke @entity96 , not @entity75 , and because @entity21 did n't speak @entity96 well at the time , he did n't get to know them very well			1
but they struck him as " a normal family , like my family			0
" " @entity25 " did n't talk much about @entity6 , @entity21 said			1
he has n't seen his friend in years , since the @entity6 moved home to go to a private school			1
but he 'd like to see him again -- particularly if it did n't mean going to @entity6			2
is there political change in the wind in @entity6 ? " i would like to speak with him to remember old times , you know , " @entity21 said			1
" because you know for me , he was also an important friend			0
he was my best friend at the time			0
i would like to see him again			0
" but , @entity21 said , he 's not sure if now is the right time			1
" just now i do n't know if it 's good to see him again			2
... if he asked me to go visit him			0
i do n't know if i go or not , " he said			0
@entity21 said he does n't know what to expect from @entity12 as a leader			2
to read more on @entity6 , go to @entity0 's special coverage " i can just say what i know : @entity12 , when he was 16 , he was a good guy , " @entity21 said			1
" so , i do n't think he would do something bad			0
but i do n't know what he 's been like in the last nine years			2
" i just knew him when he was 16 years old			0
he 's been in a special school for this for nine years , " he said			2
" maybe he 's another person			2
