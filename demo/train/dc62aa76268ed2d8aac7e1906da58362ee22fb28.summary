-- ever wonder what your toddler would say about your homemade baby food if she had an acid tongue and a @entity7 account ? @entity8 thinks she knows			1
@entity11 's tweeting alter ego , the @entity12 , has been making followers guffaw at the wry observations of a semi-fictional baby pundit for about a year now			1
@entity8 , a social media and online marketing manager based in @entity17 , works from home so she can be with her children			1
she is set to release " the honest toddler : a child 's @entity22 " in may			1
inspired by her spunky daughter , @entity24 , @entity8 began a @entity7 account that expressed what might really be going through her toddler 's mind during a particularly tantrumy week			1
" she had the ability to speak , but if she could fully articulate , what would she say ? " @entity11 wondered			2
clearly , many of her nearly 200,000 @entity7 followers would like to know the same thing and get a kick out of @entity8 's interpretation			1
@entity0 reached out to @entity8 to find out why toddlers are so sassy , how @entity7 fits into modern motherhood and what makes it all worthwhile			1
an edited transcript of the talk is below : @entity0 : what gave you the idea to do @entity12 ? @entity8 : my 3 - year old , who was 2 at the time , we were having a really hard time			1
i have an older child , i 've been through the toddler stage before , but i think i blocked it out of my memory			1
she was being defiant and i was busy with work , and literally it was the worst week we 'd ever had			2
i just started ( the @entity12 ) for fun			1
i was so surprised by the response			2
not in a million years did i think a bunch of people would read it			2
@entity0 : working moms wear a lot of hats			2
what did you do before " supervising , " as your book cover says , the @entity12 ? @entity8 : i began in social media ... nowadays the first place you go , in terms of a really quick sense of community , is online			1
just because it can be really hard to get in the car and find the mom group			0
it was difficult for me to navigate ( being a mother )			0
wanting to read about motherhood , work - at - home moms , writer moms			1
can i still have a career ? how do i do it ? how are other people managing ? so i began taking a real interest in the parents online , and since my background is in marketing , i really wanted to incorporate that in how i would earn an income from home			0
so i began doing social media for companies			0
one was " @entity98 , " who made online organic baby food , and from there , i kept working and expanding and taking classes and working with other @entity96 firms , learning how to do my job better			0
i 've always loved writing , but " i can love it , it 's just not going to be my bread and butter , " is how i always felt			1
but i wanted to keep writing , so i wrote for sites like " @entity108 , " " @entity109 , " " @entity110 , " and really just enjoyed it			0
@entity0 : there seems to be a lot of very seriously toned parenting media on the @entity115 these days , and the honest toddler is anything but			1
why do you think that is ? @entity8 : i get that there has to be an authority source			1
i 've been in that mode , too , when writing			0
i think it 's about trying to regain control and trying to help people feel as if there is a how - to			1
even though at this point we all know there really is n't any one way			0
at one point or another you realize , there is no one way to do it , it 's going to be messy , we can pretend all we want with our @entity137 and @entity138 photos that it 's all going great			1
but it 's a struggle , so we do have to support each other and give each other a little bit of slack			1
@entity0 : honest toddler is pretty unique with regards to the content on @entity7 , too			1
@entity8 : i 've seen @entity148 or when people tweet from the perspective of an inanimate object or animal , and i think they probably match up much closer to honest toddler than most parenting tweets			1
i think it 's that different perspective			1
one of the reasons i believe it 's popular -- and i do n't think it has anything to do with me or my writing ability or anything like that -- is it has to do with parents who have already wondered what their kids are trying to say			2
who have already thought , i know , if my child had the ability to articulate , they would say something like that			0
they have the opinions of people long before they have control of their bowels			0
they really believe we are on the same level			0
they believe we are peers			0
they see their mother and father as the ones who take care of them and where they go for comfort , but they really believe they have an equal vote			0
@entity0 : that 's a lot of sass for such a tiny human			2
are toddlers sassy ? @entity8 : toddlers are ... people without filters			1
they 're exactly like us but they do n't have all the etiquette and social norms			0
so they say things that we would say if we did n't fear the social consequences			0
@entity0 : how much of @entity203 is rooted in the real life experiences of your children that you observe ? @entity8 : much of it is			1
i 'm scared to say how much because i know that -- one of the reasons i love being anonymous is because that did n't feel like i would be judged			0
not for my lack of parenting but just the situations are so crazy			0
and i know those situations happen to other people , too			0
on friday , i was tweeting about @entity24 's ear infection and going to the pediatrician 's office			2
she told me right away , " i do n't like the doctor			0
" and i knew it was going to be a struggle			0
@entity0 : at the end of the day , what makes a parent 's struggle worth it ? @entity8 : the number one thing that really makes it all ok is knowing that it wo n't last forever			1
when you contextualize any difficult experience , that 's what makes it bearable			2
with my first child , i had no idea what a contraction would feel like			0
only what i 'd seen on tv , like @entity240 , all these women screaming , ' i 'm going to rip in half , this is going to be terrible ! ' but one woman ( in a prenatal class ) , who had six kids said , ' you can handle 10 seconds of anything			2
' and she said the worst part of a contraction will probably last around 10 seconds			0
and when i was actually in labor , i thought of that			0
knowing that made it bearable			0
it 's the same thing when both my kids are still in their pajamas , crying , we 're late for school , i 'm thinking , " great , now we 're going to have to go to the secretary 's office and she 's going to see that they 're late again and that i 'm not dressed , and i have weird stuff in my eyes from sleeping so i obviously did n't wash my face or brush my teeth before i drove them there			2
" i 'm thinking all those terrible things and then i think , " they 're going to grow up and i 'm not going to be doing any of this and i know i 'm going to miss it , and they 're going to want to be with their friends and not with me			0
" so that 's what makes it doable			2
that 's what makes me able to appreciate it and be able to laugh about it .			2
