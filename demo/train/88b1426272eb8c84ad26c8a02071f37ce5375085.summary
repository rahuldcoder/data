@entity0 -- the @entity2 announced tuesday it is increasing its planning to treat 400,000 cholera cases within the next year , up from a previous estimate of 270,000 over several years , as a result of the outbreak in @entity8			1
" we need to plan for up to half of those cases occurring in the next three months because of the explosive nature of this epidemic , " the organization 's deputy director , dr. @entity9 , told reporters in @entity0			1
" we need more of everything , " he said			2
" more training for staff in @entity8 , more doctors , more nurses , more treatment centers , more medications , more toilets , more clean water			2
" since last month , when the outbreak began , the organization known by its acronym of @entity2 -- the regional office of the @entity27 ( @entity27 ) -- has distributed enough supplies to treat about 80,000 cases , he said			1
as of tuesday , the @entity8 government was reporting 60,240 people had been sickened by cholera and 1,415 had died			2

so far , cholera cases have been confirmed in eight of the nation 's 10 departments and clusters of cases are being investigated in the other two departments , he said			2

more than three in four @entity8 earn less than $ 2 a day			0
