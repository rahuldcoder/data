-- to many outsiders , cricket can seem like a pedestrian pursuit			2
but the tragic death of @entity6 batsman @entity5 has prompted the " gentlemen 's game " to ask itself serious and searching questions about safety			1
the 25 - year - old was struck on the head by a ball from fast bowler @entity14 during a state match in @entity16 and died on thursday from his injuries			1
tributes have flooded in for @entity5 but the cricket family has also shown acute concern for @entity14 , who , at just 22 , has been shattered by his inadvertent role in a former teammate 's death			1
and a pair of former @entity26 fast bowlers are united in the hope that @entity14 , who recently made his debut for @entity29 in the limited overs format , can eventually rebuild his career			1
" i do n't think there 's anybody on this planet that could understand what @entity14 is going through , " @entity32 , who took 222 test wickets for his country , told @entity0			1
" you can be told , told and told it 's not your fault but what that kid is going through is heartbreaking			2
from a bowling point of view , how does he do his job ? " he 's 22 - years - old , he 's doing something he loves to do			2
probably all he 's ever wanted to do is play cricket and represent @entity29			2
deep down as an individual , is he going to be able to pull his boots on again and bowl a cricket ball ? " it would change my approach as a fast bowler if it was me			1
you 'd be frightened to let go of the ball			2
we 're not dealing with robots , we 're dealing with human beings			2
" it is just a freak accident			2
he 'll never get over it but i hope for his sake that he can live a life that comes close to what he was expecting before what happened two days ago			2
" @entity32 carved out a reputation as a formidable pace bowler during his seven - year international career with @entity26 , regularly hitting speeds of 90mph plus			1
the native of @entity78 in the north east of @entity26 earned the nickname ' @entity82 ' thanks to ferocious spells that included plenty of short balls			1
he and @entity86 were part of a venerated 2005 @entity26 attack that helped the country win a first @entity91 battle against old foes @entity29 for 18 years			1
and while both @entity32 and @entity86 were united in their grief at @entity5 ' death , the pair believe the art of fast bowling -- built on aggression and intimidation -- should remain unchecked			1
" the mindset of bowling is almost like you are going to war , " @entity86 explained to @entity0			1
" it 's my job when i 'm representing my country to do my job to the best of my ability and it 's the same for the opposing batter			0
i want to try and impose myself on the opposition			0
" if you see a batter getting comfortable that 's when you bowl him a short ball			2
yes , you are aiming for the throat or the head but you do n't mean to hurt anyone			0
" it 's aggression but controlled aggression			0
you bowl to a methodical plan , try and work a batter out and use whichever ball you have in your armory to get them out			2
" when people make mistakes they do get hit but then that is what the helmet is for			0
unfortunately in this instance @entity5 has been hit on the back of the head			1
" part of cricket 's allure is the age - old battle between fast bowlers and top level batsmen , with short pitched bowling an electric facet of the tussle			1
the tactic emerged during @entity26 's 1932 - 33 @entity145 series with @entity29 when it began bowling short into the body to try and combat the prowess of @entity148 , arguably the game 's greatest ever batsman			1
after a hostile @entity152 pace attack utilized the short ball to become the most feared bowling unit in the game in the 1970s and 1980s cricket 's governing body , the @entity156 , tweaked the laws to allow only one bouncer per batsman per over			1
despite this change , and the advent of better protection for batsmen in the form of helmets complete with a grill to cover the face , accidents still occurred			0
with reaction times to a 90mph delivery spanning just half a second , some batsmen have been unable to live with the pace both @entity32 and @entity86 can generate			1
" i hit a guy in the head on a tour of @entity178 in 2003 , " @entity86 explained			1
" he went down , his leg was twitching and his eyes rolled back into his head			0
it 's the most frightened i 've ever been in my life			0
" i honestly felt i 'd done some real damage			0
i went to check if he was alright but panic stations set in because you do n't want to see a fellow human being in that sort of state			0
" @entity32 has also been in the same position			1
" i 've hit people numerous times in my job as a fast bowler over an 18 - year period			1
some were serious , some not so serious , " he said			0
" you do n't like that but you have to understand that 's what comes with being a fast bowler			1
you bowl this hard ball between 78mph and 100mph from 22 yards away			2
" you get it slightly wrong and people get hurt but never in a million years would you think to the extent that it 's been over the last 48 hours			0
" @entity5 , despite being diminutive in stature , was known as an aggressive player , fond of taking on the short ball and trying to hook or pull it to the boundary			1
the 25 - year - old had reached 63 not out playing for @entity29 against @entity215 on tuesday before being struck by @entity14 's delivery			1
@entity5 was wearing a helmet but the blow to his neck split his vertebral artery and caused massive bleeding on his brain			1
it has led in some quarters to calls for a change to the game 's laws to offer batsman more protection , or for protective equipment to be tweaked to cover more parts of the head			2
but @entity32 thinks any change to existing helmets might prove cumbersome and restrictive			1
" there 's a lot of people talking about it and having protection on that part of the body , " he said			0
" i 'm not sure many top end batsmen would want that much protection in and around that area because from their point of view there is a fine balance between being protected and being able to do your job			0
" if you make that a rigid area , and you ca n't move your head , arguably you are a bigger target			0
that would be a concern			0
on the other hand no - one wants to see anything come close to what has happened here			0
" if you can change the game of cricket in a way that makes it better , makes it safer , then i 'm happy and i will champion it because i love this game but i ca n't see that happening because this is a freak accident			0
" @entity86 , who took 59 test wickets for @entity26 , shared a dressing room with @entity5 when the @entity6 played a season with @entity272			1
" he was such a great kid -- he was only 21 then , " @entity86 said			1
" the energy he had for the game , the energy in the changing room -- he was good fun			0
his work ethic was second to none and he was a pleasure to be around			0
" as a young lad coming into a pretty strange environment on the @entity284 county circuit , he came in with open eyes and an open mind			0
he fitted in and grasped his chance			0
" you look at cricket over the last 100 years and i ca n't think of any cases like this -- that shows how much of a freak accident it was			0
it 's so sad he 's passed away at 25			0
" having played 26 tests for his country , the last in july 2013 , @entity5 was thought to be on the verge of a recall to the national side for its @entity145 series with @entity178 that begins on december 4			1
" he was a fine player , " @entity32 added			2
" you do n't play @entity145 at 20 and you do n't become the youngest player to get a hundred in each innings in international cricket if you 're not a special talent			0
" when he faced a bouncer he would be aggressive -- he would take it on			0
he was fighting for a chance to get back into the national side and to be cut down like this is ridiculously sad			0
" as a family orientated person the thing i ca n't see past is there is a mother and father in @entity29 who have lost a 25 - year - old son , and that is heartbreaking			0

former @entity26 fast bowlers express *sympathy* for @entity6 @entity14
@entity14 bowled the ball that struck and killed batsman @entity5
@entity86 and @entity32 hope @entity14 can rebuild his career
@entity86 says the mindset of a fast bowler is akin to " going to war "
