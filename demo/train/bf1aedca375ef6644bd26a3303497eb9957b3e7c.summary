with talks deadlocked between the @entity1 and @entity2 over plans to deploy a missile defense shield in @entity5 , a top @entity2 general raised the possibility of a possible pre-emptive strike against launch sites if a deal could not be reached			1
the warning by gen. @entity12 followed the conclusion of the international @entity14 in @entity2 , where @entity2 officials lobbied against the missile shield			1
" taking into account the destabilizing nature of the missile defense system and , in particular , creating an illusion of an unpunishable strike , the decision about a pre-emptive use of force will be made in a period of heightened tension , " @entity12 said			1
the @entity28 administration and its @entity5 allies have been trying to ease @entity2 's fears over the project by insisting that the system is directed toward countering the missile threat from the @entity34 from which @entity2 also needs protection			2
since @entity39 approved the @entity1 - designed system at last year 's summit , @entity42 , @entity36 , @entity37 and @entity38 have agreed to deploy parts of it			0
@entity39 asked @entity2 to participate in the system but negotiations have been deadlocked over @entity2 's demand for a legally binding treaty guaranteeing the shield would not be used as a deterrent to @entity51 's own systems			2
during thursday 's conference , the @entity1 special envoy for strategic stability and missile defense said there were discussions aimed at easing @entity2 's concern			1
" we discussed how the @entity5 missile defense system is designed and configured to counter ballistic missile threats from the @entity34 , and we have made clear we have no intent or desire to undermine @entity2 's strategic deterrent , " said @entity59 , the special envoy			1
but @entity66 believes the defense shield would be able to take out @entity2 missiles			2
to drive the point home , @entity2 opened up one of its elite radar operations to conference attendees and showed a computer simulation of an attack against @entity5 and @entity2			0
as part of the simulation , four missiles were launched from somewhere in the southern hemisphere and targeted three cities in @entity5 and one in @entity2			0
when @entity2 launched a missile to intercept it , its missile was taken out by the @entity5 missile defense system			1
but the @entity1 says the radar and interceptor missiles it plans to place in eastern @entity5 wo n't have the ability to shoot down @entity2 missiles			0
@entity39 deputy secretary - general @entity87 , who listened to @entity12 's comments , told reporters he does not believe a missile defense system in @entity5 would not affect @entity2			1
" i took careful note of the details that gen. @entity12 presented about their plans			0
but he did indicate that those steps would not be implemented until @entity2 was convinced that the threat , the so - called threat from our missile defense system was growing , " he said			1
" so we have time to reassure @entity2 that there is no threat today and there 'll be no threat tomorrow			0
" late last year , then - @entity2 president @entity106 threatened to withdraw from the @entity108 treaty on nuclear weapons reductions and deploy ballistic missiles in its exclave of @entity113 on its border with @entity5 if @entity39 moved ahead with the plans for missile defense			2
tensions increased in december when @entity2 's ambassador to @entity39 , suggested @entity51 would close transit routes that send vital supplies to troops in @entity122			0
the deadlock over the missile defense shield has also proved problematic for leaders from both the @entity1 and @entity2			1
at a nuclear summit in @entity127 , president @entity28 could be heard asking @entity106 for some " space " on the missile defense system in @entity5 , telling the @entity2 president he will have more " flexibility " after the november election			1
" this is my last election , " @entity28 said			0
" after my election i have more flexibility			0
" in response , @entity106 said he would pass on the information to the incoming prime minister and former president , @entity139			0
republicans in the @entity1 seized on the comment as an opportunity to criticize the president for politicizing foreign policy decisions			0
meanwhile , @entity139 has repeatedly in recent years warned the @entity1 and its @entity5 allies against deploying such a defense system , saying @entity2 would be forced to deploy its own countermeasures .			2
