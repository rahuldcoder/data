@entity0 , @entity1 -- as some in @entity1 officially kicked off their first work week monday since its epic earthquake and tsunami , others -- especially in the country 's northeast -- grieved the loss of loved ones , kept fleeting hopes that missing could be found alive and tried to come to grips with a disaster that literally tore some communities apart			1
the nation 's @entity17 , citing prime minister @entity16 , reported more than 15,000 people have been rescued in the days since friday 's 8.9 - magnitude tremor			1
but , while 1,598 people were officially dead monday according to the @entity23 , the fear was that the final death toll could be exponentially higher			1
that official figure , for instance , does not include 200 to 300 bodies in @entity28 that have yet to be recovered , @entity17 reports			1
nor does it include half the population of @entity0 -- some 9,500 people -- who may be unaccounted for			1
in that northeastern @entity1 town , a family photo album lay on the sodden ground , showing a beaming man holding a newborn baby -- happiness out of place amid the devastation and carnage left by a tsunami that occurred just after a massive earthquake			1
only a handful of buildings were left standing , with the rest a mangled mess of rubble			2
a boat sat on the edge of town , carried more than two miles inland by the tsunami			2
when the tsunami warning sounded friday , " most people ran away , " said @entity53 , who was working in a local government office near the water			1
" some had to leave the elderly or disabled behind on the second floor			2
i think a lot of those left behind probably died			2
" as the wave hit , he said he felt as if it was happening in a dream			2
" i saw the bottom of the sea when the tidal wave withdrew and houses and people were being washed out , " another resident said			1
" i could n't watch anymore			2
" a dramatic rescue took place off @entity1 's coast sunday , when a @entity1 destroyer rescued a 60 - year - old man at sea , some 15 kilometers ( 9 miles ) off @entity78 , according to @entity17			1
the man , identified as @entity80 of @entity81 , was swept away with his house , @entity17 said			1
he was spotted floating in the sea , waving a self - made red flag while standing on a piece of his house 's roof			2
@entity80 was conscious and in good condition , @entity17 said , citing @entity91 officials			1
he was quoted as telling rescuers he had left his home because of the quake , but returned home to grab some belongings with his wife when the tsunami hit			2
" i was saved by holding onto the roof , " he said , " but my wife was swept away			2
" when a member of @entity1 's @entity104 handed him something to drink on the rescue boat , @entity80 drank it and burst into tears , @entity17 reported			1
" no helicopters or boats that came nearby noticed me , " he said			2
" ... i thought today was the last day of my life			0
" in @entity0 , search and rescue efforts were frequently disturbed by tsunami alerts prompted by ongoing aftershocks			1
when the alarm sounded , police abandoned their cars , rescue workers blew whistles and people rushed to high ground			1
" it 's your life ! " shouted one man			0
" run ! " it was a false alarm , but such warnings are taken seriously in the wake of the disaster			0
in @entity28 , south of @entity0 , @entity129 said his mother and uncle remain missing			1
they were at the family 's home when the tsunami struck			0
" frightening beyond belief , " @entity129 said			0
" i have no words			0
" many areas of the town are simply gone -- mud and splintered wood littering an area where a row of homes used to stand ; a vehicle upside - down among tree branches			0
a school , which had 450 people inside when the tsunami hit , stood with its doors blown open and a jumble of furniture -- plus a truck -- in its hallways			1
some teachers and students were able to escape the building , but officials said others did not			0
@entity28 residents said the water reached the treetops as it swept into the town			0
cars were tossed like toys , windows blasted out and homes crushed or swept away completely			0
" as i was trying to evacuate , the tsunami was already in front of me , " another young man said			0
" i tried to drive , but i ended up running instead			0
" some four - wheel - drive vehicles were seen on @entity28 roads			0
among those yet to be rescued sunday were those trapped in a hospital , officials said			1
" i 've been watching tv , but it looks much worse when i actually see it in person , " said a third young man			0
" i grew up in the house that was not close to the ocean			0
i did n't think it would be this bad , but i 'm from the west side and i guess some people could not imagine the horror of the tsunami and could n't evacuate in time			1
" some residents of coastal @entity28 returned to their homes sunday , salvaging what they could			0
others stood in long lines for limited fuel and , especially , for food and water			0
the line at one food and water distribution center was several blocks long			0
@entity201 said she has many colleagues who are unable to reach friends and family living elsewhere in @entity205 , as phone service has been spotty			0
that , she said , is " adding to the emotional toll			1
" but " for a city that 's seen so much tragedy in the last few days , the people seem very calm , " she said			1
many families are focusing on the cleanup process , she said , and there is a sense that " we 're all in this together			0
" @entity2 's @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this report .			0

the official death toll is 1,598 , though fears are it will rise much higher
citing the prime minister , @entity17 says over 15,000 have been rescued
in @entity0 , up to 9,500 people are unaccounted for
