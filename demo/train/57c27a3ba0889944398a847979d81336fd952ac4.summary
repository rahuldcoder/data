-- the three men spent 18 years behind bars for a brutal crime they said they did not commit			1
locked away for life -- with one of them sentenced to death -- the men thought they would never experience freedom again			1
they had been imprisoned for the brutal 1993 murders of three young boys in @entity12 , @entity13			1
evidence against the men was circumstantial , however , and doubts grew over the years about their guilt			1
finally , nearly two decades after the crime , the men were allowed to walk free last month , the result of a complicated plea agreement requiring them to plead guilty even while declaring their innocence			1
the men came to be known as the @entity21			1
two of them spoke to @entity0 's @entity23 in an interview that aired thursday -- their first sit - down interview since their release			2
" i had n't seen daylight in almost a decade			2
i had n't been exposed to sunlight ... for almost 10 years , " @entity21 told @entity23 about his life on death row , where he lived in isolation in a concrete cell , his food passed to him through a slot in a solid steel door			1
" the only thing you can do to maintain your sanity is to not think about the case and not think about what 's happening to you , " @entity37 said			2
" you have to create your own world in there or you 'll go insane from that stuff			2
" @entity37 still squints in bright light , the result of living for years in a dimly lit cell			1
when he left prison and saw daylight for the first time in a decade , @entity37 said , " it was like having a spotlight turned right in your face			1
" @entity37 ' friend and co-accused , @entity21 , said he spent the first few years of incarceration being beaten up by fellow inmates , who targeted a man they thought was a child - killer			1
he said he suffered a shattered skull and broken collar bone , had teeth knocked out , and was left with scars on his face			0
" but as the years progressed and people got to know me , and as the documentaries ( about the men 's plight ) came out and stuff , the curses turned into prayers , " @entity21 said			1
" those fights turned into hugs			0
" @entity21 , @entity37 , and a third man -- @entity77 , who declined to take part in the interview -- were imprisoned for the slayings of second - graders @entity81 , @entity21 , and @entity83			0
the boys ' mutilated bodies were left in a ditch , hogtied with their own shoelaces			2
prosecutors argued that the defendants -- teenagers at the time -- were driven by satanic ritual and that @entity37 had been the ringleader			0
@entity37 and @entity21 said that at the time , they were targeted for being different from the rest of their peers in the small town where they lived			0
they read different books , wore different clothes , and had different haircuts			0
" the evidence against us was our personal preferences in music , " @entity21 said			2
" i remember at one point during the trial , they lifted up a record , a @entity109 record , and i think ( prosecutor ) @entity110 said this was found in @entity116 's girlfriend 's mother 's house			0
" critics of the case against the men argued that no direct evidence tied them to the murders , and that a knife recovered from a lake near the home of one of the men could not have caused the boys ' wounds			1
more recent dna testing also demonstrated no links , according to the men 's supporters , who included actors @entity133 and @entity135 and singers @entity136 of @entity138 and @entity139 of the @entity140			1
@entity37 said their support was " uplifting " and brought attention to their case , ultimately leading to their release			0
now , the men are having to get used to elements of modern life such as computers , the internet , and cell phones , things that most others take for granted			2
even ordering a simple cup of coffee is different now			0
" at one point , i went to a coffee shop and they were like , what kind of coffee do you want ? and i 'm like , kind of coffee ? " @entity21 said			0
the two have been out of prison for a month and a week			1
@entity21 says he now works for a construction company that 's helping him get on his feet again , and he 's learning how to drive			0
@entity37 says he has n't yet found a job but is interested in pursuing visual art. he got married while in prison to @entity172 , a woman who took up his cause and started writing him letters in prison			2
she said they are still fighting for the real perpetrators to be brought to justice			0
" we want to discover who did this , " @entity179 said			0
" that 's the most important thing			0
