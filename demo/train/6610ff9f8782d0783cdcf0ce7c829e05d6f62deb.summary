@entity0 -- the @entity3 organization announced tuesday it is ending its ban on transgender contestants after coming under scrutiny recently when a @entity9 competitor was told she would be disqualified because she was born male			1
@entity3 officials insist the change is in spite of , not because of , legal threats from women 's rights lawyer @entity15 made on behalf of contestant @entity17			1
" we made the decision two days before we even heard that ( @entity15 ) was involved , " pageant owner @entity18 told @entity1 monday			1
" had i known she was involved , maybe i would n't have made that decision because she 's easy to beat			0
" @entity15 launched a blistering attack on @entity18 at a news conference a week ago , saying his pageant had no right to question @entity17 's sexuality			1
" she did not ask mr. @entity18 to prove that he is a naturally born man or to see photos of his birth to view his anatomy to prove that he was male , " @entity15 said			1
in a @entity31 posting monday , @entity18 called @entity15 a " third rate lawyer " who " actually hurts @entity17			1
" " is @entity15 a man or a woman ? ? ? ? --- - few men would know the answer to that one , " @entity18 tweeted in a personal retort to @entity15			2
@entity15 did not immediately respond to @entity1 's request for a response to @entity18 's attack			0
the @entity3 announced last week that @entity17 , 23 , could compete provided " she meets the legal gender recognition requirements of @entity9 , and the standards established by other international competitions			2
" @entity15 had criticized that announcement , saying the conditions were " ambigious			0
" @entity18 later said @entity17 could compete without conditions , but stopped short of a permanent rule change			2
@entity3 president @entity51 , in a statement released tuesday , said the credit for lifting the ban should go to the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) , not @entity15			0
" the decision to include transgender women in our beauty competitions is a result of our ongoing discussions with @entity54 and not @entity17 's legal representation , which if anything delayed the process , " @entity51 said			1
" we have a long history of supporting equality for all women , and this was something we took very seriously			0
" @entity51 joined @entity54 in a joint announcement tuesday that the @entity72 " is close to finalizing an official policy change that will allow women who are transgender to participate in its beauty competitions			2
" discussions between the pageant and @entity54 began last month after news reports that @entity17 had been disqualified from the @entity78 competition after winning a regional title , the joint statement said			2
the resulting change opens this fall 's 2013 pageant season to transgender women , it said			1
" for more than two weeks , the @entity72 and mr. @entity18 made it clear to @entity54 that they were open to making a policy change to include women who are transgender , " said @entity54 spokesman @entity85			1
" we appreciate that ( @entity18 ) and his team responded swiftly and appropriately , " @entity85 said			0
@entity17 , a 6 - foot - 1 - inch blond @entity9 , underwent sexual reassignment surgery four years ago			0
in a 2010 interview , she said she knew she was a girl at age 4			0
she said she started hormone therapy at age 14 and underwent sexual reassignment surgery at 19			0
she won a regional beauty crown qualifying her for @entity9 's national title , but she was then told the @entity78 pageant in @entity102 on may 19 was only open to " naturally born females			0
" " i am a woman , " @entity17 said in a prepared statement she read to reporters in @entity15 's conference room last week			1
" i was devastated and i felt that excluding me for the reason that they gave was unjust			0

the pageant *group* says the decision came before @entity15 made legal threats
@entity15 attacked the pageant for disqualifying @entity17 because she was born a man
the change opens the 2013 pageant season to transgender women
