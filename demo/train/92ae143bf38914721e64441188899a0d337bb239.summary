goat cafes , rabbit cafes , even loneliness - curing @entity3 cafes			1
the world of the weird cafe has moved on from cats			1
and yet , while some of these obscure cafes grab headlines for a few days and then vanish , cat cafes have proliferated around the world , to become if not the most novel , certainly the most enduring craze when it comes to themed coffee houses			1
@entity17 philosopher @entity16 reportedly once said : " the only escape from the miseries of life is music and cats			2
" and so it would appear			0
started in @entity24 a dozen or so years ago with a cafe called @entity26 , the concept was most enthusiastically embraced in @entity28 where today there are more cat cafes than anywhere else in the world -- around 150 at the last count			1
now the rest of the world is cat - ching on			2
in april the @entity36 saw it 's first feline coffee house open in @entity39 , albeit only temporarily , @entity40 recently opened its first too and a number of major @entity43 cities now also offer purr - fect coffee breaks			1
@entity45 is soon to join the fray as well			1
" my partner and i went to @entity28 18 months ago -- going to a cat cafe was an amazing experience and we decided to open our own in @entity48 , " says @entity47 , owner of @entity48 , which will open in july 2014			1
" it 's a place where animal and cat lovers can mingle , socialize and be comfortable in a quiet environment that reflects their interests			2
" cat cafe 101 for the uninitiated a cat cafe does n't sound too complicated			1
it 's a regular cafe that happens to have cats walking , or lying , around			2
but there are nuances that distinguish this kind of cafe from others			2
you often need to book before you arrive , because a ) the cats are liable to walk out as you walk in , and b ) the ratio of people to cats needs to be controlled			0
" we now have a booking system , because 20,000 people wanted to come into a 30 - seat cafe all at the same time , " says @entity75 , founder of @entity77 's @entity76 in @entity40			1
her website says the cafe is fully booked until october 2014			1
sanitation and health issues also need to be considered , and have put some people off			0
" who wants cat hair everywhere ? that would gross me out , " says @entity89 , a non-customer from @entity90			2
but @entity47 says there 's nothing to worry about : " as the cats are completely separate from the cafe , this is not an issue			2
and if people still have their concerns they should actually visit a cat cafe first			1
we would not be able to open if we were n't super hygienic			0
" most cafes also have a look - but - do n't - grab policy , to minimize catty stress and potential clawing of customers			0
feline good after all , the idea is that these cafes provide an almost therapeutic area to chill , as @entity113 owner @entity112 in @entity114 says			0
though she advises any mother visiting the cafe check her pram before leaving : some of the cats can inadvertently turn stowaway , having sought out the warm softness of a baby carrier			0
@entity123 , owner of the @entity124 in @entity125 , says : " the popularity of these cafes is probably due to the fact that many people are not allowed , or are disinclined to have pets in the city , yet they occasionally feel the need for closeness to an animal			0
" life today is busy and hectic , so offering an oasis of calm , where you can relax over a drink and enjoy ( vegan ) snacks , is important to us			0
" i think a lot of our patrons just enjoy coming to play with them			0
we also find they tend to make conversation with other patrons			0
the cafe has a nice community feel to it			0
" " what could be better than a black @entity157 , a good book , and a cat curled up beside you ( even better if it 's on your lap ) ? " says @entity152 from the @entity153 , one of the trend 's enthusiastic fans			0
" @entity164 ! the only issue i have is struggling to leave			0
" and so the cat cafe continues to spread across the globe			1
look out in the future for @entity169 , due to open in @entity170 later this year , and @entity171 in @entity172 hoping to invite people in for a cup before the end of 2014			1
