as the crisis in @entity4 enters its third year and the death toll exceeds 70,000 , @entity1 's values and interests are increasingly at risk as others fill the void left by our inaction			1
i saw this firsthand during a recent trip to the @entity14 during which i met with @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity17 concerned about the fallout of a brutal civil war			2
in @entity15 , the government and international aid agencies are scrambling to deal with more than 400,000 refugees fleeing the fighting , many of whom are women and children			0
meanwhile , our allies in @entity17 are increasingly concerned about the nightmare scenario of chemical and advanced anti-aircraft weapons falling into the hands of terrorist groups such as @entity34 or @entity36 groups linked to @entity37			0
in april 2011 , when the death toll stood in the low hundreds , i called on president @entity40 to support the @entity16 people 's desires for freedom and an end to @entity16 president @entity46 's regime			1
i proposed a series of measures to immediately isolate @entity46 , including tough economic sanctions and severance of diplomatic ties			2
unfortunately , this and similar calls by @entity54 and @entity55 went unheeded at the time , only to be implemented by this administration months later -- slowly , hesitantly and ineffectually			0
there are now two conflicts underway in @entity4			0
one is the battle to oust @entity46			1
the second is the emerging fight for control of a @entity4			0
this latter fight will pit more moderate groups within the armed opposition against @entity66			0
we need to ensure that the responsible actors win this battle and that @entity4 is no longer an ally of @entity71 and a staging point for destabilizing terror			0
@entity1 must not turn its back on the @entity16 people			1
our interests are still served by the rapid resolution of the conflict and the removal of @entity46 from power			2
what might a successful @entity4 strategy look like ? first , we can not expect @entity4 's @entity4 rulers to respect our interests and wishes if we are not willing to support them in their fight			0
while recent reports indicate that the rebels are increasingly in possession of much of the weaponry they have long sought , what they need now is ammunition			0
we should do everything possible to get moderate elements within the opposition the ammunition , intelligence support , training and other equipment they need to help hasten @entity46 's fall			1
@entity102 : @entity16 war is everybody 's problem while some worry that the @entity16 opposition is entirely anti-american and made up of radicals , the reality is that @entity36 forces remain in the minority			1
continued inaction , however , will only empower these anti-american elements of the opposition			0
we thus need to work more closely with groups such as the @entity116			0
the @entity116 has made great strides in unifying the more reasonable elements of the opposition and attempting to be inclusive of @entity4 's minorities , but it has suffered from slow and lukewarm support from @entity122			2
the @entity40 administration should back their efforts to form a transitional government that can begin to govern rebel - controlled areas of @entity4 as soon as possible and put to rest any doubts about our support			1
the additional nonlethal assistance to the @entity116 and to armed opposition groups announced by secretary of state @entity132 in @entity133 on thursday is a positive step , but much more needs to be done			1
just as the @entity137 in the late ' 40s created a generation of @entity140 who remembered @entity1 support in their hour of need , @entity16 children suffering today in refugee camps should understand that the @entity1 government and @entity1 people care about their plight and are taking action to assist them			1
although most of it can not be traced back to us , the @entity1 has actually provided hundreds of millions of dollars in humanitarian aid and nonlethal assistance since the conflict began			1
however , in the camps outside of @entity4 , international aid agencies , often supported primarily by @entity1 funds , have not made the source of their funding apparent to the refugees they are hosting			2
similarly , citing security concerns , the administration has been slow to brand @entity1 assistance inside of @entity4 and make its origins clear to the populace			2
even if these concerns are justified , there are ways to work with aid groups to utilize social media and with local leaders to highlight @entity1 's humanitarian assistance at work			1
we should also be more willing to rely not just on international nongovernmental organizations and aid agencies , but also use the moderate groups we wish to strengthen as conduits for aid , helping them legitimize themselves with the @entity16 people			1
we need decisive @entity1 leadership to avoid the worst outcomes in @entity4			0
as one @entity16 opposition figure recently told me , as long as " the @entity1 remains not present , " the crisis is likely to only be prolonged			1
this may result in a @entity4 that is a failed state in which @entity188 radicals and @entity71 agents with little interest in a liberal order flourish			0
for the sake of our security interests and the safety of our allies , we can and must do more to prevent such an outcome .			0

@entity198 : @entity1 must step in with more assistance or other actors will fill void
he says @entity40 's slowness to act to end *bloodshed* risks increasing instability in region
he says @entity1 should help moderates get ammunition and training to oust @entity46
@entity198 : @entity1 should back opposition ; the @entity16 people will remember @entity1 help
