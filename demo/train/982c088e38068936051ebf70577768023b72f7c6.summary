you have to hand it to @entity2			2
how many people , knowing what has happened in @entity5 over the last 12 years , would dare to write an op - ed in @entity7 recently containing this line : " rarely has a @entity10 president been so wrong about so much at the expense of so many " -- and not be talking about @entity12 ? the man has chutzpah			1
the op - ed in question was co-written with @entity2 's daughter @entity17 , former @entity19 worker and failed @entity21 candidate			2
the two are forming a new organization , the @entity23			0
of all the former @entity12 administration officials who have emerged in the last few days to blame the deteriorating situation in @entity5 on @entity26 , one might think @entity2 would be among the last			1
it 's one thing to turn on your tv and hear that @entity26 is a dangerous weakling from people like @entity32 and @entity33 , the ones who told us that war with @entity5 would be cheap and easy , then bring a wave of peace and democracy across the @entity40			1
but @entity2 ? @entity2 was the war 's chief propagandist , who told the @entity10 public more spectacular falsehoods than anyone , including @entity12 himself			1
@entity2 was the one who told us in 2002 that " simply stated , there is no doubt that @entity48 now has weapons of mass destruction			1
there is no doubt he is amassing them to use against our friends , against our allies , and against us			0
" he 's the one who tried to convince us that @entity48 might have helped engineer the september 11 attacks , and who said in 2005 that the insurgency in @entity5 was " in its last throes			1
" ( the war went on for 6Â½ more years			0
) @entity2 had a central role in bringing on a war in which 4,500 @entity10 gave their lives , tens of thousands more were gravely injured , we spent a couple of trillion dollars , and somewhere between 100,000 and 500,000 @entity5 died			1
@entity2 's opinion appears to be that all that death and expense never really happened ( he does n't mention them ) , and that everything bad in @entity5 can only be @entity26 's fault -- because the @entity12 administration did such a bang - up job there			1
" mr. @entity26 had only to negotiate an agreement to leave behind some residual @entity10 forces , training and intelligence capabilities to help secure the peace , " he writes			2
" instead , he abandoned @entity5 and we are watching @entity10 defeat snatched from the jaws of victory			0
" would " some residual @entity10 forces " have been able to keep a lid on the unending @entity5 civil war that @entity12 and @entity2 so effectively unleashed ? we 'll never really know , but here 's what we do know : the agreement mandating that all @entity10 troops leave @entity5 by the end of 2011 was signed by one @entity12 , before @entity26 took office			1
as negotiations over our departure proceeded in @entity26 's first term , @entity5 prime minister @entity97 -- eager to have the @entity10 gone so he could consolidate what would turn out to be a corrupt sectarian rule -- refused to grant @entity10 troops immunity from prosecution in @entity5 courts			1
without that immunity , there was simply no way @entity10 forces could remain there			0
we 've heard many people say @entity26 " should have pushed harder , " but nobody says exactly what that 's supposed to mean , or why @entity97 would have given in , especially considering how he 's acted since			2
and what does @entity2 think we should do now ? he does n't seem to have any idea			0
the op - ed contains precisely zero recommendations about @entity5			2
defeating @entity117 , it says , " will require a strategy -- not a fantasy			0
" but what is that strategy ? " sustained difficult military , intelligence and diplomatic efforts " ? oh , of course -- if only we had known ! at least he 's not alone in his arrogance and befuddlement			0
none of @entity26 's other critics seem to have much of an idea what we should do in @entity5 , or @entity132 , or anywhere else			1
they 're happy to say that whatever @entity26 is doing is n't enough , and it is n't strong			0
but if you ask them to be specific about what different decisions they would make , you 'll be met with hemming and hawing			0
that 's because there are only bad options for @entity10 in @entity5 , as is often the case in the @entity40			2
if you delude yourself into thinking that wars are simple and easy , and all that matters is whether you 're " strong , " then sometimes things become quite clear			0
we 'll just invade , we 'll be " greeted as liberators " ( that was @entity2 , too ) , and everyone will live happily ever after			0
and when what actually results is not that glorious and easy victory , but a tidal wave of violence and despair , then all you need to do is wait until after you leave office , when you can blame it all on someone else			0
read : opinion -- ignore neo-cons , the last thing @entity5 needs is more war			1

@entity167 : @entity2 has some nerve slamming @entity26 on @entity5 -- did he mean @entity12 ?
he says @entity2 was @entity5 war 's chief propagandist , *insisted* @entity48 had @entity171
@entity167 : @entity2 fails to mention the loss of life , trillions spent in @entity5 on his watch
@entity167 : where are his recommendations to solve @entity5 ? he blames @entity26 for his mess
