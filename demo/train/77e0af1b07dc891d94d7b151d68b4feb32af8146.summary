" if @entity3 does n't act soon , it will complicate our bilateral relations and raise questions about @entity3 's commitment to the rule of law , " the administration official said			2

@entity5 , 30 , has admitted in interviews he was the source behind the leak of classified documents about the @entity16 's surveillance programs			2

the @entity46 revealed @entity5 's identify at his request			1
the documents revealed the existence of top - secret surveillance programs that collect records of domestic telephone calls in the @entity1 and monitor the internet activity of overseas residents			0
the revelation rocked the @entity58 administration and @entity1 intelligence community , raising questions about secret operations of the @entity16 and whether the agency was infringing on @entity1 civil liberties			0
@entity58 , top legislators and national security officials defend the surveillance programs as necessary to combat terrorism and argue that some privacy must be sacrificed in a balanced approach			0

a series of blog posts this week purportedly by @entity5 said he leaked classified details about @entity1 surveillance programs because president @entity58 worsened " abusive " practices , instead of curtailing them as he promised as a candidate			1
