-- the stakes in this election go far beyond just who takes the oath of office in january			1
each of us is faced with choices that will have huge ramifications in our nation for decades -- and the choice is not simply about @entity13 versus @entity14 or even @entity15 versus @entity16			1
the real stakes are this : the political strategies that prove successful in this election will be replicated far into the future			1
throughout this election cycle , we 've seen hyperpartisan narratives resonate more than facts , total opposition embraced as a congressional tactic , and unprecedented dark money flow through our airwaves in an avalanche of negative ads. if those forces are rewarded , we 'll see much more of them from both parties going forward			1
they will become the new normal			0
opinion : vote , damn it ! if they are rejected , it may inspire a necessary recalibration and a renewed focus on finding ways to work together in @entity42			0
this wo n't be just because it 's the right thing to do ; it will be because it is what is seen as practical and politically expedient			0
when president @entity15 took office , the fiscal crisis was in full effect , but our nation was briefly united after the 2008 election			1
then the partisan media started to try to repolarize the nation for their profit			0
a relentless drumbeat of demonizing the president gave rise to all sorts of dark conspiracy theories , driven by the conviction that the first @entity64 - @entity63 president of the @entity63 was somehow un-american			1
hating @entity15 became a profitable cottage industry , with the publication of at least 89 different obsessively anti-obama books -- more than twice the number that were directed at president @entity69 by the end of his first term			1
unhinged ideas seeped perilously close to the mainstream , to the point that the gap between partisan narrative and actual facts seems cavernous and finds fellow @entity63 divided beyond reason			1
this has real civic cost			0
a president who has presided over a doubling of the stock market is called socialist or even communist			0
a president who ordered the killing of @entity86 is seen by some as secret @entity88 - sympathizer			2
and perhaps most important , a president whose actual record leads respected nonpartisan political scientists at the @entity93 blog to say " president @entity15 is the most moderate @entity13 president since the end of @entity96 " is instead seen as a far - left liberal			1
a reality check is overdue			0
this hyperpartisan reality distortion field has impacted @entity100 as well			0
in the past , we 've achieved a great deal with divided government -- ranging from the @entity104 , to the interstate highway system , to the achievements of the @entity108 administration , to welfare reform and the turning of deficits into surpluses under president @entity113 and then - speaker @entity114			1
but the current congressional environment has led to division and dysfunction , @entity115 fails and justifiably low congressional approval rates			0
too many conservative members of @entity100 took @entity123 's 2009 @entity122 admonition -- " i hope he fails " -- to heart			2
they argued that confrontation rather than cooperation with the new president was the best strategy			0
thanks to @entity15 's unwise overdelegation to congressional @entity13 on the stimulus bill , their approach was validated , and so an economic recovery effort that was one - third tax cuts passed along stark partisan lines			1
president @entity15 : my vision for @entity63 an individual mandate - driven health care bill , based on proposals from the conservative @entity144 implemented by @entity16 in @entity145 , was not praised as policy triangulation -- taking a @entity148 approach to achieve a @entity13 goal -- but called an unconstitutional gallop toward socialism			1
rational debate stopped when talk of " death panels " started taking hold			0
and so health care reform became the first major piece of social legislation to pass along stark partisan lines			0
even onetime bipartisan legislation was no longer embraced by @entity100			0
for example , @entity15 's proposed jobs bill was almost entirely composed of what had been bipartisan proposals -- but it was considered doa on @entity168			1
the debt ceiling was used to hold @entity63 's full faith and credit hostage , with disastrous results , including the downgrading of our @entity175 credit rating			1
the source of much congressional dysfunction is the now - routine use of the filibuster by the @entity181 , making a supermajority of 60 votes necessary for meaningful action			2
as a point of historical perspective : in the eight years that @entity148 @entity188 was president , from 1953 to 1961 , the filibuster was used only two times			1
in the four years that @entity15 has been president , the filibuster has been invoked more than 200 times by @entity192			1
add to this unhealthy civic mix the unprecedented amount of money flowing into this election -- expected to exceed $ 6 billion total			1
the most troubling aspect is the rise of dark money , the abuse of tax - exempt 501 ( c ) ( 4 ) organizations to hide donors while flooding the airwaves with negative ads. according to the @entity207 , spending from these nondisclosing groups has passed $ 200 million in this election -- more than every other election cycle over the past 20 years combined -- and 88 % of the ads airing now from outside groups are negative			1
just three groups -- the @entity214 - founded @entity213 , the @entity216 - backed @entity215 , and the @entity217 -- account for more spending than the next 17 outside groups combined			1
this makes a mockery of @entity222 promises about unlimited money being combined with unprecedented disclosure , and the net impact is chilling : this is perilously close to what trying to buy an election looks like			2
all this matters , because if outside money spent on negative ads can indeed sway an election , we will see much more of it in the future			2
but if partisan billionaires believe that their money has been wasted , it will help rein in such efforts going forward			0
we need to stop the cycle of incitement in our politics , where every action creates an equal and opposite reaction			2
in the closing weeks of this campaign , @entity16 has been promising that he will bring bipartisanship back to @entity42			0
but simply slapping on a new slogan wo n't solve these underlying problems			0
@entity16 : my vision for @entity63 if @entity16 is elected president , @entity13 will likely decide to follow the apparently successful path of the @entity192 in recent years -- play to the base with fear - mongering claims , demonize the new president from @entity257 , and obstruct his agenda in @entity100			1
senate majority leader @entity259 , a @entity260 , has already announced that he will not work with a president @entity16 , taking a page from his @entity148 counterpart , @entity262 , who pledged that making president @entity15 a one - term president was his no. 1 priority			1
republicans will complain , but they will have their own precedent to thank			0
the result will be all - but - guaranteed gridlock and division over the next four years			2
if @entity15 is re-elected , it will send the message that all the hyperpartisan distortions , the intensely ideological congressional obstruction and the flood of dark money did n't work			1
republicans will have to confront the fact that these extreme tactics backfired by alienating the moderate majority of @entity63 ( and interestingly , @entity15 currently leads among moderate voters in key swing states like @entity282 by nearly 20 points )			1
this will alter the landscape of the next @entity100 and shift the incentives back toward working together on a more bipartisan basis			0
it might even help re-center the @entity148 going forward , something i would sincerely like to see because it would be good for our democracy			2
@entity63 needs to break this fever of hyperpartisanship			2
the day after the election , we will have to start healing as a nation			2
members of @entity100 will be confronted with a fiscal cliff and serious questions about how to deal with taxes , spending , the deficit and the debt			0
if they feel that extremism and obstruction have been punished by the voters , they will find a way to work together			2
if either party feels it has achieved an ideological mandate , it will be tempted to play chicken with the fiscal cliff			0
the stakes are so high because they cut to the heart of the @entity63 experiment			2
we can not continue to allow extreme partisan distortions to define our policy debates and paralyze our capacity for constructive self - government			1
we need @entity42 to get the message that i 've heard from swing voters so often on the @entity325 -- stop fighting and start fixing			1
find a way to work together , especially on our long - term economic problems			0
that means both parties agreeing to compromise on issues of taxes , spending and entitlement reform -- a balanced bipartisan plan to deal with deficits and debt			0
it will require putting the national interest ahead of all partisan special interests -- and we wo n't be able to do that until this fever breaks			0
@entity42 is looking to your lead at the voting booth			0
now it is your decision			0
go out and vote on november 6			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity350 .			2

@entity350 : election 2012 will be a test that determines future of @entity63 politics
he asks : will extreme partisanship be rewarded at the polls ? if so , it will continue
leading @entity148 figures decided on obstructionist tactics against @entity15 from the start , he says
@entity350 : message from rank - and - file voters -- stop fighting , start fixing
