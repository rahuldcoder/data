struggling for a present for the man who has everything ? how about a skinned bear ? this was just one of the thousands of thoughtful gifts on display that had been given to the founder of @entity10 , @entity9			1
a present from former @entity13 communist leader @entity12 , the bear takes a place of pride in an exhibition house in @entity17 , three hours north of the capital , @entity19			1
officially named the @entity21 , the exhibition hall is on the official tourist route and crammed full of vases , canvases , military paraphernalia and more unusual gifts			2
the @entity27 was n't meant to see displayed are 112,225 gifts for @entity9 , his son @entity9 and current leader @entity30 from 184 different countries			1
by far the biggest donors are @entity33 and @entity34 , and most notably the communist former @entity35			1
the tour begins a soldier stands guard on both sides of the impressively large entrance door and any cameras , phones and even pads and pens are promptly taken away			0
the tour can then begin			0
in the introduction hall , the eye is drawn instantly to a domineering white stone carving of @entity9 sitting in a chair			2
i am told the eternal president still receives many posthumous gifts			2
a sneak peek through the keyhole under the ornate and pricey - looking chandeliers are glass cabinets containing some of the more important gifts			0
the official commentary says , " enemy countries too sent a lot of gifts to president @entity9 and respected @entity9 , impressed by their great personality and virtues			1
" gifts from the " enemy " sure enough , there are a couple of gifts from the " enemy country " the @entity71			0
former @entity71 secretary of state @entity72 gave @entity9 a silver dish when she visited in october 2000			1
the two countries were enjoying a lull in tensions at the time			0
in addition , @entity72 gave a basketball signed by @entity79			1
@entity9 was reported to be a huge fan of the @entity82 star			2
there is also a bowl from former @entity71 president @entity85 and his wife who visited in 1994 under the guise of a private trip			0
of course , these gifts look rather paltry when i entered the next room and saw an actual train -- a gift from the communist leader of the @entity35 in 1945			0
i then noticed the car @entity95 gave to @entity9 during the @entity97 in the early 1950s			1
not to be outdone , in 1953 , chairman @entity98 of @entity33 also gave the @entity10 leader a train			1
according to the souvenir dvd from the gift shop , 3.7 million visitors have walked through the building 's doors from its opening in 1978 until 2010 , almost half a million of whom were foreigners or @entity109			0
i see a number of @entity10 filing through at the same time as me			0
still lacking inspiration for that hard - to - buy - for person from what you 've read so far ? how about a fossilized snail , given by a former prime minister of madagascar or ivory tusks from @entity117 ? the tour guide insists most of the ivory in the world is housed in this exhibition , a claim that sounds a little far - fetched but given everything else that i have seen , somehow wholly appropriate .			0

the exhibition house is filled with gifts from 184 countries
@entity33 and @entity34 are the biggest donors
in 2000 , @entity72 gave @entity9 a silver dish and a basketball signed by @entity79
