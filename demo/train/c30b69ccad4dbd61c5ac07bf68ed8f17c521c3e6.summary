@entity0 -- attempting to forecast future events is a dangerous pastime			0
who could have predicted the spectacular fall of @entity7 politician @entity6 , once a rising political star , or the stunning escape of blind activist @entity10 from house arrest ? but forecasting is useful for journalists who should be primed to anticipate the dominant trends ahead			2
so , adding to what 's already out there , here goes			0
these are the five key @entity7 stories i 'll be looking out for in 2013 : @entity20 - @entity7 tensions the @entity20 is wary of @entity7 's military growth and economic might , while @entity7 is wary of @entity20 's pivot to @entity25 and president @entity27 's increasingly tough line on trade			1
but in 2013 , there will be more immediate points of friction between the two giants			0
@entity33 , a professor of political science at @entity35 , underlines three specific trends to watch : " number one , whether @entity27 will sell weapons to @entity39 in january ; second , whether @entity7 will continue to block @entity20 efforts to resolve the crisis in @entity42 ; and number three , @entity43			1
" @entity33 adds : " i 'm not quite optimistic about peaceful cooperation between the two countries , but in the longer term , i 'm more optimistic than many other scholars of the @entity20 - @entity7 relationship			1
" @entity7 's @entity50 to @entity25 as the @entity20 makes its strategic pivot to @entity25 , @entity7 has been considering its own relationships in its backyard			1
@entity54 is out to ink trade deals with @entity56 and @entity57 while actively expanding trade ties with @entity25 countries like @entity60 and @entity61			2
the @entity63 ' @entity54 - based chief diplomatic correspondent @entity62 tells me : " @entity7 is a cash power in @entity25			1
they 're spending billions of dollars on roads and rail through the countries of @entity25 , that will enable goods to come up through @entity7 , then back down through @entity7 , and will knit the whole region together			2
" but given the ongoing tension with @entity57 , @entity74 and @entity56 over disputed islands in the @entity76 , as well as tension within @entity61 over @entity7 's mineral mining operations , will @entity54 lose the diplomatic war for hearts and minds in the region ? @entity83 's @entity82 : cleaning up corruption the @entity85 is facing a number of challenges that are undercutting its legitimacy : a widening rich - poor divide , a desperate need for social reforms , political corruption , and a spate of sex scandals involving party officials			1
as such , the @entity85 must make cleaning up its own domestic affairs a top priority			0
political commentator and columnist @entity99 believes the new leadership 's top agenda is cleaning up the party itself , adding this observation from the recent @entity106 in @entity54 : " when @entity108 came out to introduce members of the @entity110 , he did not mention foreign policy at all			2
he did n't say anything about international relations			0
i think that 's because he realizes @entity7 's most serious problems are domestic ones , and he 's going to have to focus on those first			1
" @entity7 's @entity118 @entity7 , the world 's biggest internet market , is forecast to overtake the @entity20 in smartphone shipments and become the world 's leading smartphone market this year , according to research group @entity124			1
with some retailing for as low as $ 160 , @entity7 's cheap smartphones will make a huge social impact through @entity7			1
according to @entity134 , @entity7 editor of @entity135 : " it 's becoming more and more possible for @entity7 consumers to skip bulky desktops or even laptops and netbooks and rely solely on their phones as their primary computing devices			2
students , migrant workers , and even rural citizens stand to benefit greatly from the rise of affordable smartphones			0
" as more @entity7 venture online ( and on microblogs ) via their smartphones , there will be greater public outcry and protest , as well as greater pressure on the government to manage the added censorship load			0
" we have seen the beginnings of a digital accountability system			0
if nearly everyone has the means to record and instantaneously broadcast their surroundings , it will keep most people from acting out , " says @entity134			0
@entity7 to the @entity158 in the second half of 2013 , @entity7 's @entity159 is expected to land on the moon			1
once the lunar rover touches down on the lunar surface , expect a massive wave of propaganda touting its scientific might			0
@entity7 is still on a high after setting a deep - sea diving record in the @entity168 and successfully docking the @entity169 with the @entity171 space lab in the same week earlier this year			2
but @entity7 on the moon will do far more than stir national pride			0
it will cement @entity7 's own age of discovery for the world to admire and , in certain corners of the globe , fear			1
@entity7 explorer @entity180 says the message of @entity7 's space program is clear and highly symbolic			1
" we 're in space ... not just making cellphones			0

@entity20 wary of @entity7 's military , economic growth , while @entity7 is wary of @entity20 's pivot to @entity25
@entity7 will also be considering its own often *fractious* relationships in its backyard
corruption will also be a key issue for the new @entity7 leadership in 2013
space exploration will continue as a symbolic marker for @entity7 's development
