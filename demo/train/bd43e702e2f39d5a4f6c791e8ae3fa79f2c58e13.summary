-- pelting rains , whipping winds , mass evacuations : there is no doubt that @entity6 , by sunday , had already made a mammoth impact on the @entity9 @entity8			1
and it should only get worse			0
that 's the consensus view , among forecasters and officials , as the category 1 storm continued to chug northeastward parallel to the shore			1
even with its eye still hundreds of miles away , those on the @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20 coasts felt its wrath sunday			2
but if , as expected , it turns toward the @entity9 early monday morning , @entity6 will have an even more direct -- and potentially calamitous -- effect on millions			1
forecasters warn it will likely collide with a cold front from the @entity29 to spawn a " superstorm " that could slog along the @entity8 for days -- meaning even more wind , flooding , power outages and , with that all , potential danger			1
" i 'm expecting it to be really bad , " @entity35 told @entity0 affiliate @entity36 , after prepping his @entity39 restaurant ahead of @entity6			1
" we 're evacuating , we know that for sure , but i 'm just hoping there 's a restaurant here wednesday or thursday			2
" he 's not alone in his fears			0
the @entity45 is warning of no less than a " life - threatening storm surge flooding the @entity48 coast , including @entity49 and @entity50 , " all in addition to sustained winds in excess of 70 mph and even stronger gusts -- conditions that will affect millions of people			1
a state - by - state breakdown of hurricane preparation efforts , impacts " @entity6 has a tremendous amount of energy , " @entity61 rear adm. @entity60 told @entity0			1
" it could be bad , or it could be devastation			2
" on sunday alone , power was knocked out in places such as @entity67 , @entity19 , as rough waves crashed along the coast , said @entity70			0
another @entity71 , @entity72 , reported waves topping 12 feet further south along @entity74 outside @entity75 , @entity18			0
and by late afternoon , floodwaters washed over roads between @entity78 and @entity80 beaches in @entity81 , said gov. @entity82 , adding even more urgency for people to get out before they get trapped			0
" we 're seeing more flooding than you normally do , and particularly since the storm 's not here , " @entity82 said around 5 p.m. @entity6 took a toll well before its @entity9 arrival , causing at least 67 deaths -- including 51 in @entity92 -- as it rumbled through the @entity94			1
as of 11 p.m. sunday , @entity6 still had n't veered toward the @entity9 , though the @entity45 said that should happen " during the next several hours			2
" centered 470 miles south - southeast of @entity50 , the hurricane should make landfall late monday in southern @entity97 and the @entity98 , which includes @entity81 and parts of @entity20 and @entity19 , according to the @entity100			1
one thing that makes this storm unique is not so much its 75 mph sustained winds , but the fact such hurricane - force winds extend 175 miles out from its eye			1
that portends to affect hundreds of miles of territory , on both sides of @entity6 's eye , hit hard by destructive winds , with an even bigger swath getting tropical force - level gusts and drenching rains			1
' superstorm ' meets barnstorm as weather and politics collide @entity6 prompted evacuation orders on @entity97 's barrier islands , in downtown @entity120 , @entity20 , and in flood - prone coastal communities in southern @entity81			1
low - lying areas of @entity123 , including @entity39 and parts of @entity125 , are being cleared out as well			0
@entity126 was among those who heeded the call , leaving his @entity130 home about three blocks from the @entity132 and heading 85 miles north to his sister - in - law 's house in @entity135			2
packing what they can and stashing bigger valuables as high as possible , what happens next is now out of their hands as it may take days before they find out if they 've skirted disaster			0
" we 'll just hunker down and wait for it to pass , " @entity126 said			0
many other communities , big and small , also are bracing for the worst			0
the process of halting subway service in @entity50 , the city that never sleeps , began sunday evening			1
other mass transit systems are doing the same by suspending their services monday , including @entity156 's @entity155 service and @entity158 trains and buses in and around @entity160			1
across the bay from @entity163 in @entity164 , @entity97 , @entity161 pleaded on the plywood that covered up her burger restaurant , " be kind to us @entity6			2
" the seaside area largely dodged last year 's @entity170 , and @entity161 is hoping for -- but not expecting -- any more reprieves			0
keep a hurricane preparation checklist " everything that we 've been watching on the news looks like this one will really get us , " she said			0
" we 're definitely worried about it ... hopefully , she 'll spare us			0
" after filling his trunk with sandbags sunday in @entity182 , @entity183 , resident @entity184 said he has done what he can by clearing @entity188 decorations and other items from his yard			0
still , for all his preparation , he admits @entity6 makes him nervous			2
" i do n't want to go through this again , " @entity184 told @entity0 affiliate @entity192			0
officials from @entity18 to @entity195 have been raising alarms , and taking preventive steps like the subway shut - downs , for days			0
by sunday evening , officials already had canceled classes monday for well over 2 million public school students in districts such as @entity50 , @entity160 , @entity202 and @entity203 , while numerous universities as well as federal government offices in @entity156 and government offices in states like @entity97 were preemptively closed			1
@entity6 has even managed to put the presidential election on the back burner , turning campaign plans upside down			2
then there are the travel nightmares that the storm has already , and will continue , to cause with thousands of flights called off , @entity216 train runs scuttled , and hundreds of roads and highways expected to flood			2
a full moon , which always brings out higher than normal tides , should exacerbate storm surge problems on monday in coastal areas			0
in addition to one 12 hours earlier , high tide is scheduled for around 8:30 p.m. -- meaning parts of @entity81 and @entity97 , for instance , could see significant flooding then even if @entity6 has come ashore by then			1
irrespective of the tides , the @entity229 is forecasting potentially harmful storm surges of between 6 to 11 feet in @entity50 and @entity231			1
" this is not a typical storm			0
it could very well be historic in nature and in scope and in magnitude because of the widespread anticipated power outages , flooding and potential major wind damage , " @entity235 gov. @entity234 said , speaking of his state but just as well about many others in the mid-atlantic and @entity239			1
" essentially , this is a hurricane wrapped in a nor'easter			0
" @entity249 safety : when the lights go out @entity0 's @entity252 , @entity253 , @entity254 , @entity255 , @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity259 , @entity260 , @entity261 , @entity262 and @entity263 contributed to this report .			0
