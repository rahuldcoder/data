@entity0 -- trying to strike a balance between shedding his isolationist label and defending his nontraditional @entity6 views on foreign policy , sen. @entity2 took another jab tuesday at his more hawkish colleague , sen. @entity9			1
in a discussion hosted by @entity11 , editorial page editor at @entity12 , @entity2 argued he 's not in favor of a total abandonment of @entity16 intervention overseas but was unapologetic in saying he 's " one of the least reluctant to go to war			2
" " if i 'm ever commander - in - chief , i will not want to take the country to war , " the @entity18 @entity6 said			0
" it will be the last resort and only when the country is united			0
" @entity2 said he 's not staking out an " all or none " approach on @entity16 intervention			2
" but i do believe less			0
i believe we 've been everywhere all the time			0
we 're about to bankrupt our country and there is great danger to what we 've been doing , " he said			0
he wants 15 countries more or 15 wars more			1
" his comments came at @entity12 's annual meeting of the @entity33 , an audience that overwhelmingly favors former @entity36 gov. @entity35 as the 2016 @entity6 presidential nominee			0
the jab against @entity9 marks the latest hit in an ongoing back - and - forth between the two senators over foreign policy			1
this summer they sparred publicly after @entity2 repeatedly pushed a widely - debunked claim that the @entity45 senator took a photo with @entity48 leaders when he went to @entity49 last year			0
in turn , @entity9 blasted @entity2 for appearing to waver on his views about the fight against @entity48 , saying @entity2 's change in tune weakened his " credibility " and argued he would n't be a good commander - in - chief on national security issues			1
@entity58 , a spokesman for @entity9 , responded to @entity2 's latest comment on tuesday			1
" it 's hard to take seriously the claims of someone who repeats debunked conspiracy theories spread by @entity16 's adversaries that sen. @entity9 met with @entity48 , " @entity58 said			1
in @entity2 's remarks at the event , he brought up a @entity70 / @entity69 poll from @entity71 , saying that he liked how they framed a question on foreign policy asking whether the @entity16 should be quicker to intervene in foreign conflicts " as @entity9 suggests " or less interventionist , " as @entity2 suggests			1
" with 41 percent agreeing with @entity2 's position -- slightly fewer than the 45 percent who sided with @entity9 -- @entity2 argued that a significant bulk of the electorate is on his side and pushed back against criticism that he maintains fringe views on national defense			2
" that 's a caricature and i 'll have to fight that , but we 'll see what happens , " he said .			0
