-- @entity1 remembers being 9 years old , watching astronaut @entity2 take man 's first steps on the moon on july 20 , 1969			1
like thousands in his @entity7 generation , @entity1 dreamed in his childhood of becoming an astronaut			1
" i was very interested in the space program , " @entity1			2
" it was something that gripped the world , something that all of the world was talking about			0
" and unlike all but a very , very few in his generation , he realized his childhood goal			0
@entity19 : what did you want to be when you grew up as an @entity7 astronaut , he has logged a total of 28 days in space to date			0
after receiving his master 's degree in aeronautical engineering at the @entity28 , @entity1 flew for the @entity29 as a pilot , officer and instructor			1
but his ambitions stretched far beyond the clouds			0
@entity1 said he tried not to get his hopes too high , and he persistently turned in his forms when @entity37 accepted astronaut applications			1
the first three times @entity1 applied , he did n't make the cut			2
on the fourth try , he was selected as a member of the @entity37 astronaut @entity43 , and he now holds the title of deputy chief of @entity37 's @entity47			1
but with no set plans of launching astronauts into orbit from @entity7 soil after the final trip to the @entity53 slated for february 2011 , @entity1 and others in the space world are anxious			1
in addition to fretting about funding and jobs , they wonder if the government is losing an initiative that engages the next generation of engineers and mathematicians			0
" if we are n't doing things that inspire them , we 'll suffer from the creative standpoint , " he said			0
@entity70 , assistant manager for @entity37 's astronaut @entity71 , said that most applicants who make it to the interview rounds have been grooming themselves their entire lives for the job			1
in past years , candidates said it was the first lunar landing that sparked their interest in space			0
more recently , astronaut hopefuls said it was the first shuttle landing they saw that hooked them on aeronautics , @entity82 said			0
many number - crunchers and rocket builders in the space exploration field also say they were space junkies in their younger years			0
" it appeared as pure magic to see something so massive lift off the @entity98 , " said @entity90 , an aerospace engineer major who has been working at @entity37 as a part of its @entity92 for the past four years			1
" it seemed so different from everyday life			0
" @entity37 and the commercial space community are waiting to hear the hard federal funding numbers to determine if , when and how @entity7 astronauts can go back into space			1
president @entity106 's @entity37 proposal currently being scrutinized by @entity107 focuses on researching propulsion for deep space and asteroid landings			1
it scraps the @entity112 , which was launched six years ago with the aim of sending humans to @entity115 and back to the moon			0
the proposal would also halt @entity37 shuttle launches to the @entity53			2
instead , federal funds would be used to help send @entity7 commercial shuttles to the station			0
@entity122 , who remembers watching @entity37 videos with his dad in the 1980s , is a graduate student in aerospace engineering at @entity126			1
he worries that @entity37 's other feats could be lost on the general public without the highly visible human spaceflight endeavors			1
" when most people think of @entity37 , they think of @entity37 spaceflight and do n't know 99 percent of what ( else ) it does , " @entity122 said			1
" that 's what gets people really excited when they 're younger			2
" others think there are cheaper ways to inspire young scientists than with @entity37 manned space missions			1
" what are we trying to do here ? " asked @entity142 , the senior curator of the @entity144 's @entity143			0
" if we 're trying to inspire kids , is this the way to do it , at $ 20 billion a year ? " he questioned , referring to the cost of sending humans to the moon			0
he said @entity37 's @entity152 -- active twin robots that were launched in 2003 to research the planet 's water history -- should also grab young people 's interest			1
@entity157 , the acting deputy manager of @entity158 in southern @entity159 , said he and others reach out to elementary and middle school children in the area to tell them that with hard work , they can be a part of the local space program efforts			0
the facility conducts safety tests for @entity37 , but most children say they want to be flying , not testing			2
he 's also worried that the manned spaceflight hiatus could damper children 's interest in @entity37			1
@entity157 said many students tell him they 'll be astronauts when they grow up			0
in return , he said , he tells them , " hey , that 's great , and if you do , we 'll work to protect you , " so as not to give them false hope			2
the odds have historically been against those whose ambitions are out of this world			0
since 1978 , only .6 percent of astronaut applicants have been hired , according to @entity37 statistics			2
@entity142 said there 's potential for humans to travel farther with @entity37 's new vision , including turning shuttles over to commercial organizations			1
" i 'm not anxious , " he said , " i 'm curious as to where it 'll go			0
" he said he 's hopeful that commercial space entities will be successful and progress human space travel more efficiently than @entity37 's past vision			1
many others involved in aerospace , while holding their breath as @entity107 holds the @entity7 space program in limbo , are excited about the prospects of more people having the chance to travel into space -- including @entity37 's chief deputy astronaut			1
@entity1 and most other astronauts paid for their shuttle tickets with post-graduate degrees and years in the military			2
but , if commercial organizations take over @entity37 's suborbital shuttle missions , the next generation 's astronauts might purchase their ticket as they would a bus or plane ticket			1
for his entire life , @entity1 said , he had imagined watching a sunrise from space			2
he finally had the chance as pilot of the @entity223 shuttle mission to the @entity53 in 2006			0
watching the sun light up the underside of @entity98 , staining the ocean blue and the land green , was what he called a " gee - whiz moment			0
" " space should n't just be reserved for those who 've taken 10 years learning how to work a rocket , " @entity1 said			2
instead , as the space program evolves , it could be reserved for those willing to put a couple hundred thousand dollars down as soon as the next decade , according to @entity236 , executive director of the @entity237 .			0

astronaut @entity1 says human spaceflight inspired him when he was younger
there are no set plans for human spaceflight within @entity106 's @entity37 *revamp*
@entity1 and others in aerospace worry what will inspire children
many hope commercial spaceflight will change the game for manned missions
