-- a senior @entity2 official acknowledged thursday there is " no excuse " for child sex abuse , as he and others were grilled by a @entity6 committee about the @entity8 's handling of pedophile priests			1
it 's the first time the @entity2 has been forced to answer allegations so publicly that it enabled the sexual abuse of children by protecting such priests			1
the committee questioned a handful of @entity2 officials -- including monsignor @entity19 , permanent observer of the @entity2 to the @entity6 in @entity21 , and monsignor @entity22 , the @entity2 's former chief sex - crimes prosecutor -- for several hours thursday in @entity24			1
in his opening remarks , @entity19 said , " there is no excuse for any form of sexual violence or exploitation of children			0
such crimes can never be justified , whether committed in the home , in schools , in community and sports programs , in religious organizations and structures			0
this is the longstanding policy of the @entity2			1
" he said the body would welcome any suggestions on promoting and respecting children 's rights from the panel , the @entity44 on the @entity45			0
in a series of hard - hitting questions , committee member @entity46 pressed @entity19 over what kind of sanctions are imposed on abusive priests and whether they are handed over to the justice systems of the countries where crimes are committed			0
the @entity2 officials were also questioned on what is being done to prevent bishops transferring problem priests to different parishes in order to cover up their abuses			1
since taking the helm of the @entity8 in march , @entity61 has told a senior @entity2 official to carry out " due proceedings against the guilty " in sexual abuse cases			1
@entity2 sets up commission against sexual abuse of minors @entity69 : no ' coverups ' @entity22 said he was there to say that " the @entity2 ' gets it ' " with regard to the issue and that no one should stand in the way of the prosecution of abusive priests			1
" let 's not say too late or not , " he said			0
" but there are certain things that need to be done differently			0
i would talk about cover - up , for example , because this is a very important concern			1
" states " need to take action against citizens of the country who obstruct justice in such an egregious crime as sexual abuse of minors , whoever these people are , " @entity22 said			1
" it is not a policy of the @entity2 to encourage cover - ups , " he said			1
" this goes against the truth			0
only the truth will help us move on to a situation when we can start being ... an example of best practice			0
" this comes down to the @entity8 's work on the ground , @entity22 said , not just words			0
he said that education of clergy and laypeople connected to the church is key , as is the enforcement of guidelines on child protection			0
as for priests who have committed sexual abuse of minors , the @entity2 has made clear in a letter to bishops that it is " a no - go simply to move people from one place to another , from one diocese to another " without being open about their backgrounds , @entity22 said			1
the @entity2 officials were also quizzed on transparency			2
" the best way to prevent new offenses is to reveal old ones and to remove the offender from positions where he or she will have the opportunity to reoffend -- so openness instead of sweeping the offenses under the carpet , " a panel member said			0
the panel also urged the @entity2 officials to do " very concrete things " to help those who have suffered abuse by clergy , and to give them " closure " so they can move forward			1
" it 's a first step , " @entity147 , a regional director for @entity148 -- the @entity148 -- said ahead of thursday 's hearing			0
" five years ago , we never thought that something like this would even be possible			0
" but the @entity154 , a nonprofit legal group which has worked alongside @entity148 , said the @entity2 had " consistently refused to accept responsibility " for sexual abuse of children and that its response was still " unsatisfactory			1
" " the @entity2 attempted to relegate the issue to the past and claim it is a new era , that they now ' get it , ' but they continue to refuse to turn over records for prosecution , punish higher - ups that covered up the crimes , or provide any real evidence that they are now putting the safety of children above the reputation of the @entity8 , " said an attorney for the center , @entity161			1
" nonetheless , today 's hearing is a milestone in calling for an end to these days of impunity			0
the international community is demanding answers , and that is the first step toward true accountability and , we hope , an end to the widespread violence against children			0
" ' a wound that hurts the church ' panel members said that what the @entity2 officials expressed thursday was a welcome change in attitudes and that they wanted to see the measures promised become a reality			2
@entity19 assured them that action on the issue of sex abuse was a priority			2
" for the @entity2 , the whole problem of the abuse of children is a wound that hurts the church as a community of faith , and it 's a suffering first of all within the community of faith , " he said			1
" and therefore it becomes not just a legal but moral and human commitment to continue to support and defend the principles of the convention that are protecting the children in a very specific way			0
" @entity0 's senior @entity2 analyst , @entity216 , said observers are looking to see whether the @entity2 under @entity61 ' leadership will crack down on bishops accused of covering up abuse by their priests			1
it 's rare to see senior @entity2 officials grilled in public in the way they were thursday , @entity216 said			2
while the details that have emerged are not new , he said , the hearing signals that the world is watching to see whether the expectations of reform raised by @entity61 ' steps so far will be matched by action on the ground			1
one matter of contention is that the @entity2 argues that its direct jurisdiction extends only to the tiny @entity237 and not to the @entity8 as a whole , although it provides guidelines to it			2
other questions asked thursday dealt with the church 's approach to forced adoptions of children , including historical cases where religious bodies in @entity248 and @entity249 are accused of removing children born to unmarried mothers , who were then given to " more suitable " adoptive parents			0
the panel asked the @entity2 officials what action was being taken to reunite those children with their families and to punish those responsible for their removal			1
it also urged them to encourage care of orphaned or abandoned children in homes rather than in church - run institutions , where they may be vulnerable to abuse			1
the @entity2 ratified the @entity45 in 1990 , but critics say it is failing to abide by its provisions			2
pope @entity61 lays down the law on child sex abuse on @entity2 grounds pope : ' act decisively ' in april , @entity61 recommended that the church 's @entity280 " act decisively with regard to cases of sexual abuse , first of all by promoting measures for the protection of minors , as well as in offering assistance to those who have suffered abuse , carrying out due proceedings against the guilty , " the @entity2 said at the time			1
the statement does not specify who " the guilty " are			0
but in recent years , priests , nuns and other people connected to the @entity8 have been accused of sexually abusing children			0
@entity61 called for the church hierarchy to " formulate and implement " directives to address an area he described as " so important " to the church 's credibility and worship			2
' most vulnerable ' victims even with the inroads made , @entity148 would like to see more action from the @entity2			1
" @entity61 has been a very popular pope , but when it comes to child sexual abuse , he has followed the same strategies as his predecessors , " @entity147 said			1
his predecessor , @entity301 , said many times that abusers should be prosecuted , but @entity148 and other victims ' groups said he did too little			0
@entity301 spoke with some victims of sexual abuse by priests on papal visits to countries including the @entity311 and the @entity312 , where he expressed his " deep sorrow " about the scandal			2
the @entity2 selected those he met			2
the challenge for @entity61 is to do more , @entity147 said			2
" this is a man who has a rock star - like popularity			0
he has reached out to the poor ; he has reached out to the desperate and the vulnerable			0
but he has continually ignored the sex abuse victims , those who are the most vulnerable and who were hurt by his clerics , " @entity147 said			2
" it is time , it is a simply easy thing for him to do , and i believe that this hearing will really prove to him and the world how important it is that he take decisive action to stop abuse and coverup			0

new : @entity2 response still unsatisfactory , @entity154 says
@entity2 urged to take " concrete " steps to help victims of abuse by clergy
" it is not a policy of the @entity2 to encourage cover - ups , " a @entity2 official says
victims ' group calls for action , not words ; says pope @entity61 should take a new path
