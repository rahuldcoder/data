to many @entity1 , @entity0 is synonymous with fantasy -- its glossy lines , popping color palettes and fanciful scenarios are an escapist 's delight			2
but one of the most celebrated makers of the wildly popular @entity11 graphic novels says he draws on reality as much as possible			1
@entity13 was just 23 when his second @entity0 propelled him to fame in @entity11			1
" @entity22 , " published in 31 volumes of magazine " @entity24 " in the early 1990s , followed the fortunes of a loveless delinquent who joins a basketball team to impress a girl , and then discovers a natural ability for the game			1
@entity13 's interest in @entity0 was piqued when , at nine years old , he read a popular baseball @entity0 called " @entity27			1
" it had " attractive characters , " he recalls , " and how they play baseball and how their bodies were drawn -- all these things looked so cool			2
" a keen basketball player at high school , @entity13 says drawing a basketball @entity0 was a natural way for him to combine his two loves , and he believes " @entity22 " readers could see the obvious enjoyment he took from drawing basketball			1
" i really drew it in the way i liked , did whatever i wanted , " he says			2
" @entity22 " has now sold almost 120 million copies , been licensed in 17 countries , and adapted into an anime tv series			1
an @entity49 version was released in @entity50 in 2002			0
its popularity endures : according to a 2012 survey by research group goo , it is still the second most popular @entity11 @entity0 , and is responsible for the single most memorable piece of dialogue -- when a coach says , " if you give up , the game is already over ! " its legacy has also continued well beyond the page			1
@entity13 is credited by some with having popularized basketball amongst a whole generation of high school students			1
in 2007 , his publisher inaugurated a scholarship that sends high school basketball players to study in @entity50 , and in 2010 , @entity13 received a commendation from the @entity72 , for his services to the sport			1
more from @entity75 : @entity50 's black cowboys fight for their place in history @entity13 says he likes to photograph scenery -- flowers , trees , cats , the sky -- to deepen his appreciation of the natural world			1
he also draws on first - hand observation : while working on " @entity87 , " an award - winning wheelchair basketball @entity0 begun in 2001 , @entity13 attended a @entity91 game to study the players ' musculature and posture			1
" after i saw it closely , i was able to draw with more reality , " he says			0
when he is ready to start a new work , @entity13 first discusses possible storylines with an editor			1
next , he installs himself in a cafe -- where he ca n't be distracted by dvds or the internet -- and begins drafting the story in small sections , hand - drawing with pencil on paper			2
he conceives in terms of double - page spreads -- " i think about what the readers would see first when they open the next page : what would jump into his or her eyes first ? " -- and says , ideally , characters generate their own narrative			2
" if you can have vivid characters , they will make the story themselves			0
by putting them in certain situations or having one meet another , they naturally make stories by reacting to each other			0
" ( " it sounds like a very easy thing , " he adds			0
" i wish it was			0
" ) @entity13 finds the next stage , drawing with pen or brush , more enjoyable			2
with pen , he says , " i get into a very subtle , delicate world of work ; " with brush drawing , " it gives me more freedom ... the brush goes to some uncontrollable place			2
" more from @entity75 : @entity146 sculptor @entity145 's painful search for truth in particular , @entity13 says he pours himself into the task of capturing facial expressions			1
" i try to express what kind of feelings the characters are having , and how strong those feelings are , as if they are actually coming out of my body			0
" it is like i become one with the character , " he says			0
" i think it is similar to acting			0
" " when i am drawing the face expression of the character , i have the same expression on my face			0
i never realized myself , but people have told me so			0
" tradition dictates that he take special care over face shapes and eyes , but he says drawing hair is fun			0
" there is no set way of drawing ( hair ) so i can draw pretty much as i like ... you do n't have to think about anything when you draw hair			0
" @entity13 also strives for realism in behavior and dialogue , and says the most important thing is to create and populate a world readers can believe in			1
" the imaginary person should exist as if they really exist there , and should think in the way they should , act the way they should , and say a word that they would say			0
" @entity190 this is n't solely about drawing technique , but also depends on a certain authenticity			0
" the picture should be the artist 's original one and it does n't matter whether it is drawn well or not , " @entity13 says			1
" @entity0 artists are different from painters : we have to have a story , meaning , and entertainment			0
