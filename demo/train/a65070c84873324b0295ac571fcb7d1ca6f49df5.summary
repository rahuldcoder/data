@entity0 , @entity1 -- tens of thousands packed @entity6 's football stadium saturday , cheering the @entity7 for the first time since graphic child sexual abuse allegations rocked the university and led to the ouster of its president and iconic football coach			1
the @entity7 lost the game -- the first in 46 years without @entity17 as head coach -- 17 - 14 to @entity19			1
but the man who replaced @entity17 said that the actions of fans and players saturday sent a message against sexual abuse and helped them personally come to grips after an emotional week			2
" it was a day of solidarity for the children , for the victims -- it was a touching moment , " interim coach @entity27 said of the crowd 's demeanor and emotional pre-game ceremonies focused on child abuse			1
" i felt that today , just maybe , the healing process started to begin			1
" a moment of silence was held before the game in honor of the alleged victims			2
current and former players from @entity6 and @entity19 locked arms amid thunderous applause from more than 100,000 fans -- many of them wearing blue , to focus attention on child abuse -- in attendance			1
interim @entity6 president @entity49 said saturday that it was important for the @entity6 community , led by the team 's players , to " show unity " for one another and in opposition to child sex abuse			1
doing so , he said , is particularly important in the wake of the flood of emotions , including on - campus rioting , that followed @entity17 's firing			1
" we ... want to demonstrate not just to the @entity6 community , but to the rest of the world , that @entity6 is a caring community , that @entity6 is moving forward with a sense of purpose , and that hopefully there are elements of good that can come out of this situation , " @entity49 told reporters after the game			1
@entity75 : despite defeat , healing process begins @entity17 's son @entity78 , a current @entity6 assistant coach , told @entity79 on saturday that " the world ... turned upside down " exactly one week earlier with the arrest of former defensive coordinator @entity82			1
a 23 - page grand jury report described crimes that @entity82 allegedly committed against young boys between 1994 and 2009 -- some of them on campus , both during and after his tenure at at @entity6			0
@entity82 's attorney , @entity88 , has said that his client disputes the report			0
in addition to @entity82 , @entity6 athletic director @entity92 and senior vice president for finance and business @entity91 were charged for failing to report the abuse to authorities and misleading authorities			2
@entity17 , the winningest coach in top - level college football history , was not criminally charged			2
still , he was dismissed wednesday by @entity6 's board of trustees for failing to do more when a then - graduate assistant told him in 2002 that he had seen @entity82 allegedly rape a boy in the showers of a campus athletics facility			2
@entity17 alerted @entity92 , his immediate boss , but it was years before law enforcement first learned about the allegation			0
the graduate assistant , @entity107 , who was later promoted to a full - time assistant coach , eventually described the alleged incident in graphic detail to a grand jury			0
@entity107 was placed on administrative leave friday			0
scores of people gathered outside @entity17 's home early saturday evening to show their support			1
the former coach was n't home during the game -- later pulling up in a minivan -- but his wife , @entity121 , did come out briefly to thank those who " propped me up " after the turbulent week			0
@entity78 said saturday that he had a simple message for his father before the @entity7 took to the field saturday			0
" @entity127 , i wish you were here ( and ) we love you , " the younger @entity17 recalled to @entity79 , breaking into tears			0
many questions remain unanswered in the case , with several investigations launched by the school and the state to probe further possible wrongdoing by team , athletic department and administrative officials			0
whatever those investigations find , @entity49 has said it is imperative to promote dialogue about sexual abuse and change the " culture " at @entity6 so that witnesses do n't hesitate to come forward			0
" never again should anyone at @entity6 -- regardless of their position -- feel scared to do the right thing , " @entity49 said earlier this week following his appointment as interim president after trustees on wednesday ousted @entity148			1
@entity148 initially voiced support for @entity92 and @entity154 following the release of the grand jury report saturday			0
@entity2 's @entity157 contributed to this report .			0
