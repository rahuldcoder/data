@entity5 several post-romney 2016 dynamics on the @entity2 side , plus two big debates with complications for congressional @entity2 filled our @entity8 sunday trip around the " @entity11 " table			1
@entity12 bows out , and @entity13 moves in with @entity16 now officially out of the 2016 @entity2 nomination chase , @entity14 becomes a more wide - open race , and the @entity13 camp is hoping to make fast inroads			1
@entity22 of the @entity23 notes with a crowded field , @entity21 's vote likely will be splintered and the state is known for its strong evangelical base			0
@entity27 , stop three on the calendar , could be influenced by the possible candidacy of home state senator @entity30			0
@entity16 would have been the early @entity14 favorite			0
but now ? " i 'm told that immediately after @entity16 made his move on friday , the @entity13 folks started to figure out how they can get two key operatives in that state , @entity36 and @entity37 , both old @entity14 pros , both of whom were @entity16 guys who had stayed loyal to @entity16 but are now free agency , " said @entity22			1
coming soon : a parade of longer than long shots watch @entity14 over the next couple weeks and you might come to the conclusion it is easier to count the @entity2 not considering a 2016 presidential run			1
on tap to visit soon : former @entity51			0
@entity52 of @entity53 , @entity54 of @entity55 and @entity56 of @entity57			0
also , former @entity59 ambassador @entity58 and former high tech ceo @entity60 have @entity14 travel plans			1
all of them are longer than long shots , should they run			0
but former @entity66 gov. @entity65 is due back , and @entity68 gov. @entity67 , too			0
@entity69 views @entity14 as critical -- and hopes the lack of a competitive @entity72 race could help his case			0
in @entity14 , independents can vote in either primary , and @entity69 thinks more of them might be inclined to cast their votes for a @entity2 candidate			2
@entity78 hits the road @entity80 was the most active @entity2 contender early on , and @entity82 's @entity81 reports the freshman @entity84 senator has a busy travel schedule ahead as he tries to build his support -- and not always in predictable ways			1
" we 're told that @entity80 is going to travel every weekend , going forward -- he 's not going to do many cattle calls , " said @entity81			1
" @entity90 was in @entity21 last weekend , he 's in @entity21 next weekend , because he can draw a crowd on his own			2
" " and something that he 's doing , as he travels the country , is meeting with physicians -- thinking about a way to bring in some people who are not necessarily politically active who can give , who can talk about among the community , so he 's talking to the fellow doctors as he goes around			0
" but @entity80 is also including some @entity2 stops that are a bit more predictable : " he 's back to red meat next weekend in @entity21 , " said @entity81			1
" he 's doing a liberty event and his big rally is audit the @entity107 that 's about the reddest meat that you can get			0
@entity110 : but for some in @entity2 , this @entity111 is different @entity113 @entity2 are planning to vote yet again on legislation that would repeal @entity115 , keeping a 2014 promise to voters even though they have no prayer of getting president @entity119 to sign on			2
but for some @entity123 , @entity122 's @entity121 says , the calculations are a little different because the law has been in effect for a few years now -- and access to health care is expanding even in @entity128			2
" this time , a lot of @entity2 in this new @entity132 , many of them freshmen who are from conservative states , particularly in the @entity27 , are going to have to actually vote for something that 's now in play , but is actually giving people in their districts -- whose votes that they 're going to need -- health insurance , " said @entity121			1
" this could put some @entity2 , who in two more years will have to run again , in really , really tricky place , especially if they have core constituents who are benefiting			2
best way to @entity146 ? @entity2 looks to escape border funding fight republicans won big in 2014 , and came to @entity5 full of energy to start 2015			2
so one might find it hard to believe the party 's theme for the looming @entity154 spending fight might be best described as searching for the best way -- and time -- for the @entity2 establishment to cave			1
@entity159 of @entity160 laid out the calculations : " and whether that means letting it go off the cliff or what -- whether it means letting it go off the cliff and then coming back ... they all kind of think they 're going to cave , they just have to find the best way to do it			0
