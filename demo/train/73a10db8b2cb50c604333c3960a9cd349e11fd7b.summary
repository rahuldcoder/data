-- prosecutors on friday dropped human trafficking charges against a @entity4 princess , saying a domestic servant living with her in @entity7 was not being held against her will as previously alleged			1
@entity8 , 42 , was charged in july after the 30 - year - old woman alleged that , among other things , she was n't free to leave @entity8 's condominium in @entity12			1
but an extensive investigation after @entity8 's arrest determined that while the servant might have believed the allegations , the woman 's movements were n't restrained and @entity8 was n't guilty , @entity20 district attorney @entity19 told reporters outside a courtroom after a judge dismissed the case friday morning			1
" the evidence indicates very strongly at this point that the ( domestic servant ) was not actually the victim of human trafficking , and so this case had to be dismissed , " @entity19 said			1
@entity8 , one of the wives of @entity4 prince @entity34 bin @entity32 , was arrested and charged after the servant , originally from @entity36 , left the condominium , flagged down a bus and then talked to police			1
the woman accused @entity8 of paying her only $ 220 month , significantly less than the $ 1,600 a month she said she was promised			2
the woman also claimed that she was denied medical care , and that , when she arrived in @entity4 to work for the family before following @entity8 to @entity7 , the family confiscated her passport , authorities said			1
but a post-charging investigation revealed that the " original terms of her employment were not what had been stated , " and that the other allegations also did n't bear out , @entity19 said			2
" the fact is she did receive medical care , and ... there really was not the restriction of her movements and her freedom to come and go as she certainly believed , " @entity19 said			0
@entity19 said the movements of the family 's other four workers were not restricted			0
" i do n't think ( the servant ) was lying to us			2
i think that there was a lot of misunderstanding and misapprehension , " @entity19 said , one of @entity8 's attorneys , @entity69 , told reporters he thanks @entity19 " for standing up and doing the right thing			0
" " our sense is justice was done in this case , " @entity69 said			0
" the princess is innocent , and we are now satisfied that 's been shown			0
" @entity8 's family and the five workers had traveled to the @entity80 in may			0
at the time of @entity8 's arrest , police said all five workers were in good health and there were no indications of physical abuse			1
this would have been the first forced labor human trafficking case to be prosecuted in @entity20 under @entity7 's @entity91 35 , which passed in november and increased the penalty for human trafficking			0
@entity0 's @entity94 and @entity95 contributed to this report .			0
