long , running east to west			0
@entity6 and windswept , some 1,400 meters ( 4,600 feet ) high , they make a forbidding sight			0
but for centuries , they have been the refuge of the desperate and a place of mystical importance			0
last week , the mountains saw another influx , as tens of thousands of people tried to escape the rapid advance of the @entity18 in @entity3 and @entity19 , or @entity20 , which now calls itself the @entity18			1
many of them were @entity23 , fleeing the town of @entity25 and surrounding villages in convoys of dozens of vehicles			1
the lucky ones used smuggling routes to cross into @entity19 and back into @entity32 - controlled areas of northern @entity3			1
the less fortunate were either seized by @entity20 militants or headed into the mountains			1
the @entity23 are an ancient religious sect -- mainly ethnic @entity36 -- that worship an angel figure held by many @entity39 to be the devil			1
@entity20 has executed yazidis who refuse to convert to its extreme ideology			0
by sunday , according to @entity3 and @entity32 sources , as many as 20,000 had been able to leave the mountains -- perhaps half of those who had been stranded for nearly a week			1
@entity48 agencies estimated late last week there were as many as 50,000 people in the mountains			1
@entity32 peshmerga forces appear to have secured an escape route , but a hazardous one with @entity20 militants still roaming the area			1
according to some accounts , @entity36 also helped people use parts of northeastern @entity19 under their control to reach @entity32 areas of northern @entity3			1
@entity61 airstrikes saturday against several armored personnel carriers used by @entity20 in the area may have helped the escape			2
but president @entity64 acknowledged saturday that securing safe passage for those still stranded would be " logistically complicated			0
" @entity67 of @entity68 , who is in the region , spoke sunday of families that had escaped , arriving in the town of @entity73 after a circuitous trek through @entity19 " in terrible condition , fainting from exhaustion			1
" some had told her that @entity20 had abducted women and girls			0
unless food and water reach those remaining , mainly on the southern slopes , they have an impossible choice between dying of dehydration and giving themselves up to @entity20			0
daytime temperatures exceed 30 degrees @entity89 )			0
video of a @entity32 relief mission showed a helicopter landing with supplies on a barren scarp			0
hundreds of desperate people ran toward it			2
twenty lucky ones were able to scramble aboard for the return flight , many of them hysterical			0
a few dozen more have been picked up by @entity3 helicopters , which have also been bringing aid to the mountains			1
photographs from last week showed thousands of people abandoning their vehicles before trekking to higher altitudes , carrying what they could			1
on the northern side of the range , @entity110 were also fleeing , as @entity20 fighters pushed toward the mountains from two directions			2
a few took refuge in caves , according to those who have escaped			0
many more wandered the boulder - strewn slopes			0
the @entity123 has carried out three relief drops on successive nights since thursday , which have included some 50,000 ready - to - eat meals			0
defense secretary @entity127 said the @entity128 had " pretty solid information " that of the 72 bundles dropped by @entity130 and c - 130 aircraft in the first mission , more than 60 had reached " the people who were trapped up there			2
" two more @entity61 airdrops followed , the latest on saturday night , as well as one by the @entity137			0
the @entity138 -- @entity138 -- estimates that at least 20 flights would be needed to keep the thousands trapped alive for a week			1
@entity141 is also planning aid drops			0
crossroads of conflict the @entity23 settled in the area around @entity25 in the 12th century			1
the mountains on which they now suffer had a special place in their beliefs			2
@entity23 tradition held that @entity151 had come to rest on the summit			1
as a minority , they are no strangers to conflict and persecution			0
through the ages , cultures , religions and ethnicities have competed and clashed in this part of @entity3			1
in the early 19th century , the @entity36 , @entity162 and @entity23 all had different names for @entity25			1
@entity32 fighters invaded @entity23 lands , killing hundreds			1
@entity167 , a @entity168 colonial officer who visited the area in 1838 , said the @entity23 had " kept the whole of the country between @entity172 and @entity173 in a state of alarm " until being " pacified " by the @entity175			1
when he reached the town of @entity25 , @entity176 found a fertile place fed by mountain streams , but the " ruins of many @entity183 buildings " recalled earlier battles			0
another colonial visitor , @entity184 , wrote in the 1920s that " until a couple of years ago the @entity23 were ceaselessly at war with the @entity162 and with everybody else			1
" everybody else included the @entity194 army , which had tried to force the @entity23 to convert to @entity195 in the last few years of the 19th century , a story told by the traveler @entity189 in his " @entity190 in a @entity191 , " written in 1895			1
after the @entity23 had been told to convert , @entity189 wrote , " none responded			2
christianity they were less unready to accept ; the @entity110 were their friends and fellow - sufferers			0
@entity195 had always cursed and persecuted them			0
" so the @entity200 sent troops commanded by his son to @entity23 villages			2
" the soldiers slew in all some five hundred men			0
... the pretty women and girls he took captive , marrying them by force to his soldiers			0
" the @entity23 did indeed see @entity110 as fellow sufferers			2
a hundred years ago , they helped @entity213 christians fleeing @entity194 to settle in the shadow of the @entity1 , along with @entity215			2
but in the spring of 1918 , @entity194 forces arrived and destroyed the settlement as well as many @entity23 homes			2
for a while after the collapse of the @entity175 , the @entity23 were unsure whether they would end up as part of @entity3 or @entity19			1
eventually , in 1933 , an international commission placed @entity25 inside @entity3 -- a decision by colonial overlords that would later haunt the @entity23			1
during @entity228 's rule , many of their settlements were razed and their inhabitants forced into " collective villages " as a buffer against the troublesome @entity36			0
as @entity241 writes in the blog @entity243 , " @entity228 bulldozed countless @entity23 towns until there was nothing left but gravel , and then forcibly moved their former inhabitants into collectives situated in locations that served his strategic interests			2
" at least one of those collectives saw its population swell with refugees from @entity25 in recent days			0
even after @entity228 was overthrown , there was little peace for the @entity23			2
relations with @entity162 remained tense , and after a 17 - year old @entity23 girl in the town of @entity254 was suspected of having a relationship with a @entity162 teenager , extremists murdered more than 20 @entity23			2
the girl was stoned to death by her own relatives for daring to have an " impure relationship " -- a so - called honor killing			0
at the time , the region was a stronghold of @entity263 in @entity3 and a conduit for militants arriving from @entity19 to fight @entity61 forces			1
suicide bombings in august 2007 targeted @entity23 communities in and around the town of @entity270 , killing nearly 200 people			1
one @entity61 military raid near @entity25 in october of that year uncovered hundreds of @entity263 documents listing foreign fighters who had passed through the area			0
now another -- much more powerful -- surge of @entity278 militancy threatens the existence of one of the @entity282 's most vulnerable peoples .			0

tens of thousands of people are trying to escape militants from the @entity18 in @entity3 and @entity19
many of them are @entity23 , who fled into the @entity1 last week

sources say as many as 20,000 have been able to leave the mountains , but many remain
