@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's clothes hang neatly inside his closet			1
his room is tidy and his bed is sharply made			2
he says it 's " a blessing " that he even has his own room to keep clean			2
" this is all i 've got , really , " @entity4 says			2
" it 's clean , comfortable , safe -- that 's a big thing			1
" his immaculate living quarters contradict his life , which was upended by his addiction to alcohol			2
and that 's what brought him to @entity19 in the first place			1
on the cinder - block wall next to his tv stand , @entity4 keeps a tally of how many days it has been since his last drink			1
at this moment , four days are crossed off the calendar			0
about 60 late - stage alcoholics live at @entity19 in @entity0 , which is partly funded by the state of @entity1 , and operated by @entity29			1
it 's not a treatment center , although residents have access to counselors			2
they 're even allowed to drink at @entity19 -- the alcohol is n't provided , but the men are allowed to bring it to the residence			1
the residents receive a monthly check of $ 89 , and most of it goes to alcohol			0
" we can use that cash on anything we want to do , " resident @entity44 says , matter - of - factly			2
" and i do n't only use it on alcohol , i use it on personal needs like toiletries ... but after that , i use it on booze			0
" meet another @entity19 resident @entity19 -- often called a wet house -- operates under the principle that it 's safer and cheaper to have these guys drinking in a controlled environment than out on the cold @entity1 streets			1
" these are all men that have been through treatment , numerous attempts , " says @entity61 program director @entity60			0
" these are men that lost their jobs , relationships , homes due to alcohol -- all family ties pretty much have really reached rock bottom			0
" the men are either recommended by the county after numerous visits to detox centers , or they can apply to live there			0
dr. @entity77 : pointed questions on ' wet houses ' @entity60 says @entity19 follows a harm - reduction model : it provides shelter , meals and medical attention for late - stage alcoholics , defined as those who have suffered a host of physical and psychological problems because of their drinking			1
" the staff treat you with respect , " @entity4 says			0
" i 'd be in a bad , bad position without a place like this			2
... i would be running around panhandling and annoying people and maybe even stealing			0
" ' harm reduction ' or ' giving up ' ? there are at least five " wet houses " for chronic alcoholics in @entity1			1
@entity29 operates two in the @entity101 -- @entity19 in @entity0 and the @entity102 in @entity101 -- with the help of state funding			1
and there 's a similar residence , called @entity107 , run by the @entity109 community in @entity101			1
@entity110 opened 1811 @entity111 , a state - subsidized residence for late - stage alcoholics , in 2005			1
and other cities , including @entity114 , @entity115 ; @entity116 , @entity117 , and @entity118 are considering building similar housing			0
there was a lot of opposition in @entity110 when the residence was first proposed in 1999			1
a legal challenge led by a prominent businessman delayed the opening of 1811 @entity111 for six years			0
" a lot of the rhetoric that their attorney used was that it would be a party house , a free - for - all , " said @entity133 , administrative director for @entity110 's @entity134 , which oversees the residence			1
" it really has more of a feel of a convalescent home than a party house			0
" a @entity141 - led research team studied a group of 95 chronically homeless alcoholics and found that in one year , they cost taxpayers more than $ 8 million in hospitalizations , detox center treatments and incarcerations			1
when the same group spent one year in @entity110 's @entity151 program -- residences where they are allowed to drink -- the same group cost $ 4 million in taxpayer money , according to the study , which was published in the @entity156			1
there are other @entity151 programs across the @entity159 that emphasize providing shelter first , then treating addictions later			0
so far , in @entity116 , there has n't been a lot of opposition to building a residence where alcoholics can drink , city administrator @entity162 said			1
the potential savings of taxpayer money is at the heart of the argument for a wet house - style residence that is part of mayor @entity177 's 10 - year action plan to end homelessness , @entity168 said			1
" what we 're trying to tell them is that it 's going to affect everybody -- representatives from 911 , from the medical side , as well as the criminal side , " she said			0
" if you have police pick them up , then that 's taxpayer dollars			2
" manager : housing chronic alcoholics makes moral , budget sense @entity61 in @entity0 advertises itself as a " cost - effective and compassionate housing option " that " costs less than $ 50 a night , " compared with a night at a detox facility , which costs more than $ 200			1
but the idea of giving chronic alcoholics access to their drug of choice on the taxpayers ' dime is unacceptable to most addiction counselors			1
it 's basically giving up on a treatable disease , according to @entity208 , a director at @entity210 addiction treatment centers in the @entity0 - @entity101 area			1
" we feel that that it 's never too late , and that even if the alcoholic does n't want help , does n't mean that their drinking should be condoned or in any other way enabled or facilitated , " says @entity208 , author of " @entity219 : my story of @entity221			0
" " i see the wet house model as a model that enables the addict in the alcoholic to continue those destructive patterns			1
" dr. @entity77 , an addiction specialist and host of @entity229 's " dr. @entity77 " show , says that the idea of a residence allowing alcoholics to drink raises some concerns			1
" it seems to me that these organizations sometimes use terminology that suggests this is a harm - avoidance option			2
but this , too , is treatment , not hospice , " @entity77 said			0
" if wet houses provide safety , comfort and some measure of respect for those with a serious illness , they may be the best choice for some			1
" @entity4 's story after vodka ruined his career as a kitchen manager , @entity4 found himself sleeping under a bridge -- or " sleeping under the stars , " as he puts it			0
" [ i 'd ] get so drunk , it did n't matter , " he says			0
then , five years ago , he made his way to the @entity102 , before moving to @entity19			1
" my sister kind of pooh - poohed it , [ she ] thought , you know , ' why would you move into a place like that when you know you have the problems that you have ? ' " @entity4 says			1
" but i think after awhile , they came to realize this was a pretty good thing			0
" they would rather see me in a place like this than on the streets			2
" @entity4 had been in and out of detox centers " at least 100 " times , sometimes just staying there for a shower and a place to sleep			2
he does n't like to talk about his past , but he readily takes responsibility for his situation			0
" i regret a lot of decisions that i made			0
i really have nobody to blame for any of my misfortunes , " he says			0
" it 's because i drank and the way i drink ... if i did n't drink , i think , things could have been very different			2
" on april 1 , the first friday of the month , @entity4 gets his $ 89 check and cashes it			0
after a couple of purchases at @entity292 , he spends the rest at a liquor store			0
" a majority ( of the $ 89 ) goes to drinking , and i know that must sound horrible to the taxpayers , but that 's what it is , " he says			0
" maybe that 's all there is left for me , " he ponders , his voice trailing			0
" and it only makes you feel good for maybe a day or two , and then the money runs out or , you know , the physical and then mental things start going on ... and it just makes things worse			2
" but the few moments that it does make you feel good almost seem worth it			0
" his routine , like that of most chronic alcoholics , revolves around his next drink			1
and that , he says , makes it impossible to stay connected to his siblings who live in @entity323 and @entity1			1
" i do n't see them very much			0
to be quite honest , i kind of avoid them , " he says			0
" it 's like , what do you talk about ? ' well what are you up to now , @entity4 ? ' ' well , i live in a wet house , and i do n't work			2
nothing 's going on with me			0
' " @entity4 says he still has a sliver of hope that he can turn his life around , when asked if he expects to spend the rest of his life at @entity19 : " well , that just depends on how much time i have left , " he says			1
" you know , people die here all the time			0
... ( there 's ) a possibility of not spending the rest of my time here , of maybe pulling myself up and making lifestyle changes			0
" less than a month after that interview , @entity4 died at the age of 52 -- a shock to those who knew him			0
@entity19 officials did not have any details about his death , and his family could not be reached for comment			1
his words captured the struggle that chronic alcoholics face every day : " it gets to where you almost feel afraid to quit drinking because it 's like sometimes , it just seems like that 's all there is			2
" @entity2 's @entity366 reported from @entity367 and @entity368 reported from @entity0 .			1

homeless alcoholics can drink on the *premises* of @entity19 in @entity1
supporters say these so - called wet houses provide a safe place and save taxpayer money
those opposed , mostly addiction counselors , believe the model gives up on a treatable disease
there are wet houses in @entity110 and @entity101 - @entity0
