citing a @entity13 source close to the investigation , @entity11 reported friday that @entity14 was able to use a computer at the market to email a copy of the attack video before he was killed by police			1
@entity14 was carrying the @entity26 camera on his torso during the january 9 attack and subsequent standoff , the source told @entity12			1
@entity13 investigators have viewed the recording , said @entity11 , who shared details of his reporting with @entity2			2
but a second police source told l'express saturday that it could not yet be determined whether @entity14 had managed to email out the video			1
" there is a strong probability that this video may have been transmitted to a recipient and not to a traditional media outlet , " an investigator told @entity12			0
the investigator expressed his fear to see that video surface online one day			2
the source said @entity13 investigators have examined computers recovered from the grocery store and are looking into what accomplices @entity14 may have connected with around that time			1
several survivors said @entity14 tried to connect to the internet on his own computer but failed			2
he then went to a second computer in the store after forcing a hostage to help him			0
he inserted his memory card into the computer and appeared to be manipulating video or image files on the computer			0
@entity14 reportedly had proclaimed his allegiance to @entity62			0
he is believed to have killed a policewoman a day before the market attack			0
officials said they believe @entity66 , @entity14 's widow , may have played a role in the plans and has fled to @entity69			0
two days before @entity14 was killed , brothers @entity71 and @entity72 attacked the offices of satirical magazine @entity74 , killing 12 people and injuring 11			2
they died the same day as @entity14 as police moved in to end a separate siege .			0
