-- a federal judge in @entity2 has ruled that @entity3 is not liable for the some of the compensatory damages sought by third parties in the worst oil spill in @entity9 history , leaving @entity10 responsible for the majority of those claims			2
" @entity10 is required to indemnify @entity3 for third - party compensatory claims that arise from pollution or contamination that did not originate from the property or equipment of @entity3 located above the surface of the land or water , even if @entity3 's gross negligence caused the pollution , " the order states			1
the judgment is similar to the decision that came down last week regarding @entity29 rig owner @entity27 's responsibility in the 2010 @entity31 disaster			1
in the ruling tuesday , judge @entity32 notes the similar contractual indemnity issues between @entity27 and @entity3 , and accordingly left it open as to whether @entity3 would also be held liable for punitive damages or civil penalties under the @entity38			1
@entity3 was contracted by @entity10 to cement the @entity39 that was the source of the oil spill , and had argued its contract protected the energy company from legal action resulting from its work			1
" @entity3 agrees with the ruling to the extent that it requires @entity10 to honor its contractual indemnity obligations , " said @entity46 , @entity3 's director of corporate affairs			1
earlier this month , @entity51 scientists said they had confirmed through chemical testing just how much oil was released in the disaster , which begain with the april 20 , 2010 , rig explosion aboard the @entity29 that claimed 11 lives , and continued for nearly three months afterward			0
@entity51 said approximately 59,200 barrels of liquid oil per day flowed out into the @entity31 , and that the " leaking gas and oil quickly separated " into three different areas : as an underwater plume of droplets , an airborne plume of evaporating chemicals , and the slick of oil visible on the @entity31 's surface			0
@entity10 said tuesday that @entity3 still needs to be held accountable			1
" today 's ruling , together with last week 's decision on @entity27 's financial obligations stemming from its conduct at the @entity39 well , is a strong signal that contractors involved in critical well operations will be held accountable for their actions under the law , " a @entity10 statement said			1
" all official investigations have concluded that @entity3 played a causal role in the accident , and following this ruling , @entity3 is , at a minimum , responsible for any punitive damages as well as civil penalties to the extent that they may apply under the @entity38			0
moreover , the court determined that if @entity3 is found to have committed fraud , then the indemnity could be void , " @entity10 said			2
last september , the government issued a formal report on the oil spill , finding that @entity10 , @entity27 and @entity3 all shared responsibility for the explosion , but that @entity10 was " ultimately responsible " for operations at the site " in a way that ensured the safety and protection of personnel , equipment , natural resources , and the environment			2
" the @entity106 oil giant said it has already paid billions in damages and that the other culpable parties are still on the hook			0
" @entity10 has acknowledged its role in the accident and has paid more than $ 7.8 billion in claims , advances and other payments to individuals , businesses and governments , regardless of whether third parties ultimately would be responsible for any of that sum or additional liabilities			0
our charges and provisions never assumed any recovery from @entity27 or @entity3 for pollution - related damages			0
these two decisions should put an end to the attempts by @entity27 and @entity3 to avoid their obligations			0
" a trial to determine how the division of blame will be allocated is set to begin on february 27 in @entity2 .			0
