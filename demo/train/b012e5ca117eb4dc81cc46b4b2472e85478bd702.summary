with another investigation yielding no direct ties between gov. @entity3 and the @entity5 scandal , critics are questioning the purpose of continuing the @entity8 - led probe , when yet a third investigation — run by the @entity10 — is also ongoing			1
former gov. @entity11 , a widely esteemed figure in @entity14 politics who co-chaired the commission that investigated the 9/11 attacks , is accusing the state legislative committee of partisanship and acting in a " purely political " fashion			1
" i know something about nonpartisan investigations , this is n't one , " the @entity21 told @entity22			1
" democrat @entity26 , co-chairman of the panel , confirmed that they have n't determined whether the @entity14 governor knew about the lane closures ahead of time			2
but he 's vowing to continue the committee 's work until more questions are answered			2
the findings — set to be released in a report monday and obtained by @entity22 's @entity37 — fall in line so far with a review conducted by @entity3 's administration earlier this year , in the sense that both have found no wrongdoing on the part of the governor			0
meanwhile , @entity47 attorney @entity46 is still conducting a federal probe into the incident , where lanes to the nation 's busiest bridge were closed for alleged political reasons , causing major traffic gridlock in the town of @entity56 , @entity14 for four days in september 2013			2
@entity11 , who was once a mentor for @entity3 , had a falling out with the governor after @entity3 's re-election , and as the news about the bridge scandal made national headlines in january , @entity11 issued sharp criticism about the @entity21 governor			1
he openly questioned @entity3 's leadership skills in an interview with the @entity66 , and told the @entity68 's @entity67 that @entity3 managed a culture of intimidation within his administration			0
@entity11 on friday was hesitant to offer his views about @entity3 's personality or reputation , only revealing , " i do n't see it the way i once did			1
" the two have made amends this year , and @entity11 said @entity3 asks him for advice " every now and then			1
" " we 've had our differences and we still do n't agree on everything , " he conceded , before shifting his comments back to the committee 's investigation			2
@entity11 freely admits that he thought the scandal merited investigation from the outset , saying there was a " tremendous number of questions " when the news broke			1
but he 's frustrated with how the @entity8 - led committee has run the investigation so far			1
the makeup of the committee consisted of four @entity21 and eight @entity8 , including the two co-chairs , @entity26 and @entity97 majority leader @entity96			1
@entity21 complain that they were n't granted equal participation in the investigation , saying they had no say in the selection of legal counsel for the probe , nor in the selection of witnesses or the private interviewing of witnesses			1
the committee hired former assistant u.s. attorney @entity108 of @entity109 , the same prosecutor that went after former @entity109 @entity8 gov. @entity110			1
the internal probe launched by @entity3 's own administration — which cost taxpayers millions of dollars -- was also not a truly bipartisan effort , @entity11 acknowledged			1
but that probe , he continued , " never pretended to be anything except for what it was , " and " when you 're accused of a criminal act as governor , you got to spend time on it			2
you do n't have much choice			0
" asked if the legislative committee should end its investigation , @entity11 said , " i think they should have stopped a long time ago			1
" " if they 're going to continue , they should just do it right , " he said			0
" they should bring in the @entity21			1
" @entity21 assemblywoman @entity132 said there 's been " grave concerns regarding the impartiality " since the committee was formed earlier this year , referencing complaints about participation			1
her grievances , however , are nothing new ; republicans frequently registered their complaints during public hearings this year			0
the committee , she argued , has been languishing			0
" we have done absolutely nothing for months upon months			0
we have received no communications from our chair since this summer , " @entity132 said			0
" i do n't see what else there that we 're expected to do here			0
" a @entity8 member , assemblywoman @entity152 , disagreed that the committee was partisan and felt that she " was treated the same as ( her ) colleague across the aisle " in terms of having access to the panel 's lawyers and to documents released by the co-chairs			1
she acknowledged that @entity8 members were not privy to private interviews of witnesses but said " we let them have the flexibility , " referring to the counsel selected by committee leadership			1
as for whether or not she thinks the probe should continue , @entity152 said the committee should " regroup " and find a consensus on monday			1
for his part , @entity26 fiercely hit back at accusations of partisanship and pledged that the committee would march on with its work			0
" the investigation was run in a fair - and - even handed fashion , " he told @entity22			0
he denied that he was part of the leak of the latest report , which was first reported by the @entity182 , and said the legal firm was chosen out of state " so no one could allege there was a political tie " to a local law firm			0
" i have the highest respects for governor @entity11 , but i believe the information he 's acting on inaccurate information , " he said			2
the probe , he continued , has been limited due to a lack of access to witnesses who are also being asked to cooperate in the federal probe			0
their testimony could help the panel come to a more conclusive finding , he said , stressing that the report set to be released on monday still shows uncertainty about what the governor knew and did n't know			0
the report also details that a top adviser to @entity3 , @entity207 , and the governor exchanged multiple text messages about the bridge scandal in 2013 during preliminary hearings about the traffic jam			0
@entity213 , however , had testified to the panel earlier this year that she only sent him one text message and deleted it			0
the discrepancy is one of the questions that still needs to be answered , @entity26 said			0
he argued that the @entity21 backlash over the committee 's work is " their only recourse " to criticize the process			2
" let 's face it : it 's partisan sniping because this is an embarrassing episode for the @entity21 in which a high ranking member of the governor 's staff , for clearly political reasons , closed lanes leading to @entity5 , creating not only a public safety nightmare but just traffic gridlock for an entire community for four days , " he said			1
as for why the committee should continue on top of the @entity47 attorney 's probe , he said the legislature has a " constitutional role " to conduct oversight of the administration and make sure a similar scenario does n't happen again			2
and national @entity8 are n't letting this go either			2
@entity246 , press secretary for the @entity247 , said the report 's findings still show a side of @entity3 that could damage his 2016 presidential aspirations			0
" some of @entity3 's closest aides and allies put public safety at risk , seemingly to exact petty political revenge , and in the aftermath , they lied about it , " he said in a written statement			0
" that , in itself , is inexcusable conduct coming from the administration of someone who wants to be @entity265			0
