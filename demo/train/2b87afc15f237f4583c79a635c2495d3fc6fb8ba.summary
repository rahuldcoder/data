@entity0 , @entity1 -- editor 's note : football fans @entity4 and @entity6 were in @entity1 late december when the country won a major tournament for the first time			1
the event sparked wild celebrations in the @entity13 nation but joy soon turned to carnage as five people died and dozens were injured in the celebrations			1
celebration time : five people were killed on @entity1 roads as football joy got out of control			1
after spending a month in @entity1 we can safely say that the @entity1 are passionate about three things : @entity26 , or @entity26 as the locals call him ; football ; and the tourist dollar			1
everywhere you look you see football			2
the locals proudly sport imitation merchandise of their favorite @entity35 team anywhere and everywhere they can			2
other than on your person , the next best place to show your allegiance is on your motorbike through stickers			2
some local football teams even play in the strips of their favorite club			2
while we were in @entity1 the @entity46 cup was contested			1
it is the premier football contest in @entity13			0
every second year the countries of the region do battle for the crown			0
up until 2008 , the only winners of the cup had been @entity54 and @entity55 with three titles each ( @entity57 has been the bridesmaid three times )			1
after pool play , the best of two finals series was played out between @entity55 and @entity1			1
thanks to the close proximity , and some historical conflict , there is a strong rivalry between these two countries			0
the @entity69 played host to the @entity1 in the first leg , where the visiting underdogs were winners , stunning the home crowd by winning the match 2 - 1			1
the reverse leg was played in @entity77 , the capital city of @entity1			1
after unexpectedly winning the first final , local interest was even higher than normal			0
we watched the game in the coastal city of @entity0			0
the locals flocked to their tv sets and the beer flowed freely			0
each tv was like a magnet for thirsty football fans			0
do you have a great football tale to tell ? send us your story and you could be featured on @entity92 ! we quickly realized there was a pecking order and that the most hardcore fans had the best seats , whilst the " fair weather supporters " were relegated to the back benches			0
as foreigners we were at the very bottom of the pecking order			0
we were resigned to watching the match from the street kerb on small plastic seats half in the rain which refused to dampen the crowds ' spirits			0
predictably @entity55 took the lead and were up 1 - 0 ( making it 2 - 2 on aggregate ) and time was ticking away			1
@entity1 's tactic of playing breakaway " kung fu " style football was looking largely ineffective against the more structured , controlled and dominant @entity55 approach			1
still , the @entity1 were doing enough to create the odd opportunity to gives the locals hope			1
still tied up on aggregate , and with the end of regular time looming , the @entity1 were awarded a free kick			1
the kick came in and a @entity1 player managed to find it with the crown of his head sending the ball to the back of the net and the locals through the roof			1
everyone jumped to their feet , there were hugs , high fives and toasts			0
as outsiders we sat stunned and could only watch the spectacle unfolding			0
with the game effectively over , the victors were overcome with emotion whilst the fans were overcome with energy			0
the locals were eager to include us in celebrations , with the nominated @entity148 speaker communicating with us in his limited vocabulary			2
we replied with our full @entity1 vocabulary of smiles , nods and numerous thumbs up			2
the older men who had been doing the majority of the drinking were content sitting and enjoying each other 's company , while the younger and more boisterous sections of the crowd had their own form of celebration and they swiftly brought the streets alive with a massive motorcycle posse			0
led by the rider with the biggest @entity1 flag , they proceeded to lap the town honking their horns and generally getting excited			2
with the roads slick from a weeks worth of rain and the drivers impaired from a cocktail of excitement and alcohol , we wisely watched from the sidelines			0
after finding out that dozens of people were injured and there were even a few deaths -- it seems we made a good choice to keep out of it			1
but while we did watch on , we were left wondering : how do the passengers stay on the bikes when they jump up and down ? how can anyone see where they are going with all the flags ? and , where were the traffic police ? we 're offering a reward to anyone that can tell us what the @entity1 supported before cable television brought top flight football to the masses			2
whatever it was , we suspect it died a very quick death .			0
