-- @entity1 , a major international environmental conference begins in @entity3 on wednesday , billed by its organizers as a " once in a lifetime " opportunity to safeguard our planet for generations to come			1
for three days from june 20 , scores of world leaders and tens of thousands of people from all over the world will descend on @entity14 in the hope of reaching consensus on how to achieve this			1
some critics have already dismissed the event as a hugely expensive talking shop that stands little more chance of succeeding than previous environmental summits			0
here we look at some of the key issues surrounding the conference			0
what is @entity1 + 20 ? @entity1 is a summit that takes place from june 20 - 22 , organized by the @entity31 to tackle environmental issues			1
its name signifies it is being held in @entity14 20 years after a similar " @entity34 " in the same city			1
the biggest @entity31 conference in years , it is being billed as a major effort to improve mankind 's relationship with the planet			1

@entity54 prime minister @entity53 , @entity56 chancellor @entity55 and the entire @entity57 have also declined to turn up			0
@entity59 president @entity58 and his @entity61 counterpart @entity60 have confirmed they will be going			1
@entity31 secretary general @entity63 will also be there , as will @entity66 's prime minister @entity65 , with @entity68 's premier @entity67 expected to attend			1
also present will be representatives of so - called " stakeholder " groups deemed crucial for future environmental decision making			2
these include organizations speaking for children , indigenous peoples , workers , farmers and the business sector			0
a huge security operation will also be deployed to safeguard the summit			0
in all an estimated 50,000 representatives from 190 countries are expected , including around 120 heads of state and government			2

it also aims to ensure that any new environmental policies will transcend international borders			2
within these goals , there are key areas of discussion , including food security , water and energy -- and a focus on developing countries			0
drafting an agenda and getting everyone to agree to talk about it is has not been easy , however			0
ahead of the summit there have been weeks of haggling between participants			0
with so many vested interests , organizers have struggled to whittle down hundreds of pages of recommendations and goals into a manageable document			1
why is it important ? the world 's environment has continued to suffer since the 1992 summit			2
the @entity125 's recent @entity124 report said the ever - swelling global population is still consuming far more than can be replenished			2
the report said there was a widening and " potentially catastrophic " gap between the ecological footprints of rich and poor nations			0
global consumption of natural resources , carbon emissions and poverty have all continued to increase			0
although some contest such claims , scientific research points to a steady rise in world temperature which , if unchecked , is forecast to have catastrophic consequences for the planet			1
see also : extinction threat ' a call to leaders ' at @entity34 what do organizers hope to achieve ? it is hoped that the conference will lay the groundwork for a set of sustainable development goals ( @entity154 ) that can be adopted worldwide			1
a text produced by negotiators , but still to be approved by world leaders at @entity1 , lists processes to establish " action - oriented " @entity154			1
if adopted the text would also strengthen the @entity160 and ultimately lead to better protection for the world 's oceans			2
will they succeed ? few expect hard and fast policies to be put in place after three days of discussion and the likelihood is that participants will sign up to a document committing themselves to further action in the future			0
what is open to question is how effective that document will be given the struggle to build consensus ahead of the conference			2
the absence of key players like @entity49 has cast a shadow , as has the relative failure of the 1997 " @entity183 " on limiting greenhouse gases , which was set in motion at the 1992 @entity34			1
there are also numerous sticking points			0
wealthy and poorer nations are likely to argue over sharing the burden of cutting carbon emissions			0
there have been concerns over the exclusion of references to basic human rights , such as access to water			0
environmental monitoring methods are also expected to spark dissent			2
pessimists say any agreement will be negated by the compromises needed to win universal approval			0
in a statement released by environmental group @entity125 on tuesday , director general @entity204 criticized revisions to the @entity1 negotiating text made in recent days , calling it a " colossal failure of leadership and vision from diplomats			1
" he said the summit is " doomed to ridicule " unless world leaders " get serious about sustainable development			1
" but others , including @entity54 environment secretary @entity218 , have commended the commitment to @entity154 outlined in the negotiating text .			0

more than 100 world leaders are expected at @entity1 , but president @entity49 unlikely to show
@entity34 aims to reach a plan on how to sustain economic growth without destroying the planet
*difficulty* in reaching a consensus among different vested interests could mean watered - down outcome
