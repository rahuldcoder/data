-- on the eve of the anniversary of the tragic massacre at @entity4 in @entity5 , yet another shooting broke out friday -- this time in a high school in the suburbs of @entity9			1
a few people were reported injured , so far , while the gunman took his own life , police said			0
and once again , an @entity15 community reels -- bewildered that such violence could occur among its young people			0
while the vast majority of youth murdered in the @entity15 are gunned down in the street , school shootings that are rare in other countries occur far too frequently in @entity15			0
the @entity15 does not have unusually high rates of crime , violent behavior or mental illness compared with other high - income countries ; but our rate of homicide with firearms is nearly 20 times higher			0
@entity33 gun laws that allow dangerous people easy access to guns plays an important role in this disparity			1
there was reason to believe that @entity41 would be forced to put public safety interests ahead of the special interests of the gun lobby after 20 young children and six adults were gunned down at @entity4 a year ago			1
public opinion surveys showed near unanimous support for expanding background checks and broad support for other measures to keep guns out of the wrong hands			1
grass roots movements including parents and faith - based groups mobilized to advocate for stronger gun laws			1
for the most part , @entity41 once again caved to the gun lobby			0
however , 15 states plus the @entity60 , accounting for roughly 44 % of the @entity15 population , strengthened their gun laws in 2013			2
eight of these states , including @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , made fairly substantial changes by enacting background - check requirements for all handgun sales			2
@entity71 adopted a licensing system for handgun purchasers and stronger regulation of gun dealers			0
@entity76 , @entity5 and @entity71 expanded firearm prohibitions for high - risk individuals			0
moreover , the @entity80 administration took action on many relevant executive orders			0
a director for the @entity84 has finally been confirmed by the @entity85			0
federal agencies are funding research on gun violence			0
but widespread gun trafficking from states with weak gun laws to states with stronger laws underscores the need for better federal laws			2
@entity41 will likely act only when more gun owners who support policies to keep guns from dangerous people become engaged on the issue			1
in a large national survey my colleagues and i conducted in january 2013 , 84 % of gun owners and 74 % of @entity107 members supported background checks for all gun sales			1
other surveys show similar findings			0
what is keeping so many gun owners on the sidelines ? one likely impediment is the way the issue has been cast as a cultural battle as opposed to a public safety problem			1
another may be gun owners ' susceptibility to the gun lobby 's bogus talking points			1
the frame for this cultural battle is not accidental			2
pushed by the gun lobby and fanned by news media 's tendency to highlight conflict , widely favored , commonsense safety measures such as background checks are portrayed as attacks on gun owners ' way of life			1
the gun lobby 's claims that background checks restrict gun ownership and lead to gun registries and confiscations are repeated and often left unchallenged			1
when you hear something enough times , you begin to think it 's true			0
and that 's exactly the intent of the @entity107 and other groups			2
here 's the reality check : background checks pose no threat to lawful gun ownership			1
federal law forbids the federal government from maintaining anything resembling a registry of gun owners			2
federal law has mandated background checks for guns sold by licensed gun dealers since 1994 without creating a registry			1
exempting private gun transactions from background check requirements facilitates gun trafficking			0
fixing this fatal flaw in the system would curtail the diversion of guns to criminals			0
in the year since the tragedy in @entity4 , it is likely that more than 12,000 @entity15 have died of gun violence and countless others live in fear of being shot			2
we should stick to facts , dispel myths , and call a truce to cultural battles			0
current federal gun laws aid criminals and the gun industry at the expense of public safety			1
requiring background checks for all gun sales would give the vast majority of gun owners what they want while keeping guns from those who should n't have them			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			0

on the eve of @entity4 massacre anniversary , there 's a school shooting in @entity65
@entity197 : @entity33 gun laws allow dangerous people easy access to guns
he says we must stop treating this as a cultural battle ; it is a public safety problem
@entity197 : even gun owners and @entity107 members support background checks
