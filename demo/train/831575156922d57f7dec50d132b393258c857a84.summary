-- @entity1 appear to actually thrive on adversity , according to a study published this week that reached the conclusion after researching the nation 's biggest economic downturn			1
this sculpture at the @entity8 in @entity9 depicts men waiting in a @entity12 bread line			1
life expectancy during the peak years of the @entity12 increased 6.2 years -- from 57.1 years in 1929 to 63.3 years in 1933 -- according to @entity15 researchers @entity16 and @entity17			1
the increase applied to men and women , whites and non-whites			0
the team crunched data from the federal government and concluded that " population health did not decline and indeed generally improved during the four years of the @entity12 , 1930 - 1933 , with mortality decreasing for almost all ages , and life expectancy increasing by several years in males , females , whites , and non-whites			1
" for most age groups , " mortality tended to peak during years of strong economic expansion ( such as 1923 , 1926 , 1929 and 1936 - 1937 ) , " they wrote in the " @entity35			1
" " the finding is strong and counterintuitive , " said @entity16 , the lead author of the study			2
" most people assume that periods of high unemployment are harmful to health			2
" the researchers used historical life expectancy and mortality data to examine the association between economic growth and population health from 1920 to 1940			1
though population health improved during 1930 - 1933 and during the recessions of 1921 and 1938 , mortality -- the death rate -- increased and life expectancy fell during times of economic expansion , such as 1923 , 1926 , 1929 and 1936 - 1937 , they wrote			1
the researchers looked at mortality rates due to six causes of death that made up two - thirds of total mortality in the 1930s : cardiovascular and kidney diseases , cancer , influenza and pneumonia , tuberculosis , motor vehicle injuries and suicide			2
only suicide went up during economic downturns , they said , citing the recession years 1921 , 1932 and 1938 , but suicides accounted for less than 2 percent of total deaths			2
those years were marked by high unemployment ; the nation experienced its highest unemployment rate of 22.9 percent in 1932 , they wrote			0
yet from 1920 to 1940 , life expectancy increased 8.8 years			1
the authors speculated about possible explanations for why population health tends to improve during recessions but not expansions			1
" during expansions , firms are very busy , and they typically demand a lot of effort from employees , who are required to work a lot of overtime , and to work at a fast pace , " @entity16 said			0
" this can create stress , which is associated with more drinking and smoking			1
" in addition , new , inexperienced workers may be more likely to become injured ; workers may sleep less and adopt less healthy eating habits , he said			0
further , boom times may translate into more industrial pollution , which can take a toll on populations ' health , he said			2
during recessions , with less work to do , employees may work slower , sleep longer and spend more time with family and friends , he said			0
with less money , they may spend less on alcohol and tobacco			0
the researchers pointed out that their work looked at the relationship between recessions and mortality on a macro level and was not predictive for any one person			0
the findings may apply to others , too			0
@entity16 , 53 , whose work was self - funded , said he has carried out similar studies that looked at @entity125 , @entity126 and @entity127			0
" in the three of them , it was the same , " he said .			0

study : life expectancy rose , mortality dropped during @entity12
@entity137 happened during surrounding times of economic expansion , study shows
study examined population health from 1920 to 1940
speculation : in hard times , more sleep , less money for drinking and smoking
