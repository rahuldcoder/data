-- two @entity2 astronauts in space , and their support staffs on @entity5 , will keep working through the government shutdown that began tuesday			1
but almost all the rest of @entity8 has been shuttered , just one of many federal agencies affected when the government shut down at midnight tuesday because of @entity12 ' inability to pass a budget			2
many of those agencies took to social media and other online venues to share the news			1
@entity19 was a popular choice for the messages			0
among them ? if an asteroid starts hurtling toward @entity5 ... well ... good luck			0
" in the event of government shutdown , we will not be posting or responding from this account , " @entity8 's @entity25 tweeted from its @entity27 account monday , just hours before the deadline in @entity12			1
" we sincerely hope to resume tweets soon			0
" the office is responsible for tracking and reporting asteroids that threaten the planet , like the 150 - foot chunk of space rock that came closer to @entity5 than the moon in february			2
the office later noted that observatories , academics and other astronomers continue to monitor the skies			0
in all , about 18,000 @entity8 employees , or 97 % of its work force , were furloughed on tuesday			1
among those still working will be astronauts aboard the @entity49			0
which may be just as well -- it 's not like they could get away from the office even if they wanted to			0
@entity8 's @entity55 will also stay open to support astronauts @entity56 and @entity58			1
" to protect the life of the crew as well as the assets themselves , we would continue to support planned operations of the @entity49 [ space station ] during any funding hiatus , " reads a @entity8 furlough plan submitted last week			1
" moreover , @entity8 will be closely monitoring the impact of an extended shutdown to determine if crew transportation or cargo resupply services are required to mitigate imminent threats to life and property on the @entity49 or other areas			1
" other @entity8 spacecraft , like the @entity75 on @entity76 and the @entity78 craft hurtling toward @entity79 , will be largely left to their own devices ( literally ) during the shutdown			2
the funding mess may be enough to have them all jealous of the @entity84 space probe , which was launched into space in 1977			0
last month , @entity8 confirmed that the original @entity84 left the solar system			2
maybe the @entity88 probe , in protest of the impasse in @entity12 , will follow suit .			0

about 97 % of the @entity2 space agency is furloughed
@entity96 astronauts , @entity55 will stay on the clock
@entity8 takes to social media to respond to shutdown
