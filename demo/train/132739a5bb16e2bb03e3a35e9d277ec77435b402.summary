-- @entity1 slaughtered and mutilated soldiers on a scale the world had never seen			1
it 's little wonder that its vast numbers of returning crippled veterans led to major gains in the technology of prosthetic limbs			1
virtually every device produced today to replace lost body function of soldiers returning from our modern wars -- as well as accident victims , or victims of criminal acts , such as the @entity21 bombings -- has its roots in the technological advances that emerged from @entity1 i. the war , which began nearly 100 years ago , produced its own crop of bionic men			1
in previous wars , severely injured soldiers often succumbed to gangrene and infection			1
thanks to better surgery , many now survived			0
on the @entity36 side alone , there were 2 million casualties , 64 percent of them with injured limbs			1
over 4,000 amputations were performed on @entity42 service personnel according to the @entity42 @entity43			0
how a century - old war affects you in all nations involved in the war an emerging generation of so - called " war cripples , " as they were referred to in @entity36 , loomed ominously over the pension and welfare system , and many government bureaucrats , military leaders and civilians worried about their long - term fate			1
one solution was returning mutilated soldiers to the workforce			1
various prostheses were designed to make that possible , pushing prosthesis manufacturing in many countries from a cottage industry towards modern mass production			2
in the @entity42 the @entity64 was established in 1917 at the @entity65 , in conjunction with the @entity67 , with the goal to give every amputee soldier a " modern limb , " enabling them to pass as able - bodied citizens in the workplace			0
while the @entity42 remained the largest producer of artificial limbs worldwide , @entity36 's prosthetic developments incorporated a particular quest for efficiency			1
@entity36 orthopedists , engineers and scientists invented more than 300 new kinds of arms and legs and other prosthetic devices to help			1
artificial legs made of wood or metal , sometimes relatively rudimentary , and often recreating the knee - joint in some way , enabled leg - amputees to stand and move around unaided			2
glass eyes and a variety of facial prostheses allowed those with defacing injuries to appear in public			2
for example , a galvanized and painted copper plate could fill in the missing eye socket and neighboring maxillary bone			0
a lost arm or hand was particularly difficult to replace			0
in the @entity42 engineers had designed a mechanical arm for that purpose that came into wide use after the war			2
the so - called @entity110 arm was not optimal for mechanical work , but it imitated the natural limb and was relatively easy to mass produce cheaply			2
it became a huge business success			0
how @entity1 gave us ' cooties ' in @entity119 , the @entity118 evaluated prosthetic technologies , such as the @entity122 arm			1
positioned at the confluence of medicine , engineering and the new science of ergonomics , the test center offers a particularly striking example of the setting that made modern prosthetics possible			0
the center 's head , the engineer and professor @entity132 , was an adherent of @entity137 's " scientific management " -- an approach that applied scientific methods to optimize work flows and labor productivity			1
his idea of a proper prosthesis was something functional and efficient , an exchangeable and mass producible replacement device that would fit with the human body			2
while earlier prostheses often tried to replicate body appearance , or to follow the inner structural plan of the original appendage -- its shape , muscles , sinews -- @entity132 saw no need to do that			2
he reasoned that airplanes could fly without imitating birds ' wings , so why did prosthetics have to mimic arms and legs ? the @entity162 , invented in 1916 , was a remarkable example of functional efficiency			0
it was basically a tool - holder with interchangeable parts			0
its " hands " ranged from a simple hammer to cutlery with elongated handles to inserts whose ends could be attached to machines			0
it could serve the carpenter , farmer , draughtsman , locksmith , lathe - turner , cabinet - maker or tinsmith			0
many of these prostheses literally merged man and machine , leaving the disabled man firmly attached to his work station			1
an amputee veteran would arrive at his work place in the factory , hook up the remaining part of his limb to the prosthesis , which in turn would be linked to one of the industrial machines in the factory			1
he would work for hours like this as a link in a functional kinetic chain			0
the image of men tied to their work resonates unsettlingly with @entity205 's prediction that the urban proletariat would one day become a mere " appendage of the machine			0
" it 's an example of how military and industrial conceptions of the body were extended to dehumanize the body itself			0
some visionaries , of course , embraced prosthetics as a means for human transformation , as if the body were a malleable object that could be dignified and enhanced by technology			0
and some thinkers go even further and interpret technological enhancement as a next step in human evolution			1
reality might not be so far behind : in 2008 runner @entity226 , a double - leg amputee , sought to compete in the @entity228 , but his running blades , made of carbon fiber and modeled after a cheetah 's leg , were seen by some as an unfair advantage			0
four years later in @entity235 , he did compete in the @entity236 , embodying a development that had its origins 100 years earlier , in @entity1			1

@entity240 : the mutilation of soldiers in @entity1 led to *revolution* in prosthetic limbs
he says engineers create limbs that would let vast crop of amputees into labor force
@entity36 was at fore , creating prostheses that literally linked the man to his work station
@entity240 : some see it as a kind of ' human evolution ; ' it set stage for advanced bionics
