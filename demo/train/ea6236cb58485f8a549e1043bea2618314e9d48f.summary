if you do n't get the job done at work , you wo n't get paid			1
but @entity3 plays by its own rules			1
specifically , @entity3 has n't passed a budget in almost four years			1
this is basic -- and required by law			0
@entity3 seems to think it 's bigger than the law , however , which might help explain one recent poll that found it less popular than root canals , cockroaches and @entity12			1
that 's why an act passed in the @entity15 on wednesday deserves widespread support , as well as @entity18 passage			1
it 's called " @entity22 , no pay , " and it means what it says			2
if members of @entity3 ca n't pass a budget on time , they would n't get paid until they did			1
sadly , this low bar seems high			0
in fact , according to the @entity29 , @entity3 has passed spending bills on time only four times in the past 30 years			1
and our elected representatives seem to have forgotten that presenting a stable plan on how to spend the money is a basic part of their job description			0
instead , @entity41 has gotten used to living from continuing resolution to continuing resolution			0
this ai n't the way it 's supposed to be			2
in fact , it is a violation of the 1974 @entity49 ( @entity50 )			0
but somehow , breaking the laws they set for themselves does n't seem to be an urgent concern to these @entity54 , despite the fact that the @entity57 government spent $ 3.7 trillion last year ( @entity50 )			2
the absence of a budget does n't just violate common sense ; there are real dollars and cents costs			1
without a budget , it becomes difficult for government to make long - term spending decisions that affect us all			2
now , @entity15 @entity69 have seized on this idea as part of their bid to extend the debt ceiling deadline until mid-may			1
to be clear , this is just kicking the can , but it 's still a responsible step in the right direction			0
" no budget , @entity83 " was originally proposed by @entity77 , a group of @entity78 , @entity69 and independents dedicated to the politics of problem - solving			0
i helped found the citizens ' group in 2010 with @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 and many others			0
the proposal was the cornerstone of the " @entity97 " plan released last year			0
the idea was quickly adopted by @entity69 @entity99 in the @entity18 and @entity101 @entity100 in the @entity15			1
but it met stiff resistance from other members of @entity3 who did n't like the idea of personal accountability for institutional dysfunction			1
now , suddenly , after the election results of 2012 , there is renewed interest in the idea , largely because it resonates with constituents as such a common sense proposal			0
" @entity22 , @entity83 " is a no - brainer			0
the proposal is getting support from more than the @entity15 leadership			1
a large number of centrist " @entity78 " have announced their intention to vote for the measure , and the @entity121 released a statement saying it would not try to oppose the measure because it would at least provide a " short term solution to the debt limit			0
" according to the bill , if lawmakers did n't pass a budget by april 15 , their pay would be docked and put in an escrow account until they found a way to work together on this front			1
not incidentally , that 's also the reason " @entity140 , @entity139 " does not violate the 27th amendment , which forbids salary increases or reductions during a current @entity3 : their salary is not being reduced , it is being withheld until they actually do their job			2
time and time again in this divided , dysfunctional @entity3 , we have seen partisan gridlock fall away only when members ' self - interest is at stake			1
that 's why we see the flurry of activity at the end of the year , when members of @entity3 want to get home for the holidays			2
docking their pay would get their attention and focus their mind			0
let me be clear : a long - term solution to the debt ceiling debacles still needs to be found			0
@entity3 is now the greatest single impediment to @entity57 economic recovery , in large part because a bloc of 50 or so votes on the far right seems enamored with playing chicken with our country 's full faith and credit			2
the last time we went through this idiotic ideological exercise , @entity57 got its @entity177 credit rating downgraded			0
@entity178 stated the reason clearly : " the effectiveness , stability , and predictability of @entity57 policymaking and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges			0
" but the @entity15 @entity15 vote to at least extend the debt - ceiling deadline and impose a common sense measure like " @entity22 , @entity83 " is sign of sanity at the start of the second @entity195 term			1
it will not solve all our problems , but at least by imposing a degree of personal accountability on members of @entity3 , it might encourage constructive cooperation instead of last - minute scrambles and hyperpartisan brinksmanship			2
if patriotic conscience ca n't compel @entity3 to work together , maybe requiring them to have some personal skin in the game will inspire them to do their job .			1

@entity211 : most *people* who fail to do their jobs do n't get paid
