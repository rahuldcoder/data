@entity0 -- congressional investigators issued a subpoena wednesday for communications from several top @entity6 officials -- including attorney general @entity7 -- relating to the discredited " @entity9 " federal gunrunning operation			1
the subpoena , issued by the @entity11 , also covers communications from @entity7 's chief of staff , @entity13 , and from @entity14 , head of the department 's criminal division			0
among other things , the subpoena includes a request for information regarding relevant @entity6 communications with the @entity23 , as well as details about the death of a @entity27 @entity26 agent last december , the source added			1
" @entity31 officials , including attorney general holder , know more about @entity9 than they have publicly acknowledged , " said rep. @entity28 , the @entity29 chairman of the @entity11			1
" the documents this subpoena demands will provide answers to questions that justice officials have tried to avoid since this investigation began eight months ago			1
it 's time we know the whole truth			0
" @entity7 has promised to comply with any @entity45 subpoena , though a @entity6 spokeswoman appeared to dismiss the development as a political exercise			1
" we 've made clear from the beginning that the department intends to work with the committee to answer legitimate questions , " @entity49 said			0
" however , this subpoena shows that chairman @entity28 is more interested in generating headlines than in real oversight important to the @entity27 people			2
" @entity9 involved agents from the @entity59 allowing illegal sales of guns , believed to be destined for @entity64 drug cartels , to " walk " from @entity66 gun stores into @entity64			1
the idea was to track the sellers and purchasers of guns to @entity64 cartels			2
but the program became mired in controversy after weapons found at @entity64 and @entity27 murder scenes were traced back to the program			0
@entity64 officials and critics in the @entity27 called the operation a failure , saying it exacerbated the longstanding problem of @entity27 weapons getting into the hands of the violent @entity64 cartels			1
a @entity29 - led congressional investigation into the matter has become politically contentious , with administration and @entity45 leaders accusing each other of acting irresponsibly			0
in a letter to @entity7 released monday , @entity28 , a @entity93 congressman , accused the attorney general of actively obstructing @entity96 ' oversight function and damaging his own credibility as a top national law enforcement officer			1
" numerous statements " made by @entity7 about @entity9 have " been proven to be untrue , " @entity28 said			1
" the time for deflecting blame and obstructing our investigation is over , " @entity28 wrote in the letter , which was dated sunday			2
" the time has come for you to come clean to the @entity27 public about what you knew about @entity9 , when you knew it , and who is going to be held accountable for failing to shut down a program that has already had deadly consequences , and will likely cause more casualties for years to come			2
" @entity28 blasted @entity7 for " negligence and incompetence " on the issue , and for offering a " roving set of ever - changing explanations " designed primarily to " circle the wagons around ( the @entity6 ) and its political appointees			1
" the operation was the @entity6 's " most significant gun trafficking case , " @entity28 said			1
" on your watch , it went spectacularly wrong			0
whether you realize yet or not , you own @entity9			2
" @entity7 testified before the @entity126 in may that he had known about the @entity9 program for just a few weeks			2
@entity29 insist that recently released @entity6 documents show the attorney general actually knew about the program much earlier			1
@entity7 and his aides continue to vehemently deny that charge			0
the attorney general responded angrily friday to @entity29 critics of his handling of the operation , charging them with using " irresponsible and inflammatory rhetoric			0
" " i simply can not sit idly by as a ( @entity29 ) member of the @entity11 suggests , as happened this week , that law enforcement and government employees who devote their lives to protecting our citizens be considered ' accessories to murder , ' " @entity7 said in a letter to members of @entity96			0
such rhetoric , @entity7 declared , " must be repudiated in the strongest possible terms			0
" on sunday , @entity28 said the @entity126 has invited @entity7 to " come and clear the record			0
" " clearly , he knew when he said he did n't know , " @entity28 said			0
" now the question is , what did he know and how is he going to explain why he gave that answer ? " @entity1 's @entity154 , @entity155 , and @entity156 contributed to this report			0
