-- over the past few days , politicians and experts have been debating the merits of the @entity6 administration 's strategy in @entity7 -- or whether there is in fact a strategy			1
the debate generally ignores a key underlying fact : the @entity13 no longer has the ability or the will to shape the outcome in @entity7 to the degree that @entity13 policy makers would like			1
at the same time , politicians on both sides of the aisle appear constrained in their ability to talk candidly about @entity13 foreign policy objectives and strategy because of concerns about domestic public opinion and so they often default to partisan sound bites			1
in an ideal world , @entity13 strategy would be carefully calibrated and aimed at a number of political , military and economic goals for the country and the region			2
yet the dynamics of the @entity13 relationship with @entity7 is similar to most dysfunctional relationships in which problematic patterns repeat and persist over time			1
one party may in fact be able to change the entrenched dysfunctional behavior of another person at the margins , but at the end of the day , countries -- as do people -- need to take responsibility for their behavior , their mistakes and their future			0
how religion could complicate @entity13 intervention in @entity7 unfortunately , the reality is that after more than 10 years of trying to shape outcomes in @entity7 , the @entity13 is forced to acknowledge it does n't have the leverage we expected			1
the next best option is to find a solution that encompasses our values but does n't err on the side of unrealistic idealism			0
@entity13 's greatest failure has perhaps been our unwavering belief that we are always able to positively influence and shape the behavior of others through rhetoric , coercion , force and diplomacy			2
leverage , as the @entity13 has historically defined it , is not as relevant in today 's conflicts			2
however , the conditions are not ripe for the @entity13 to pull @entity7 out of this quagmire given the lack of interest in @entity13 after over a decade of war and the political gridlock here and in @entity7			1
in our time as analysts at the @entity83 , we were asked to present the opposite of what political punditry and partisan speeches tend to do			2
we were often asked to outline worst - case scenarios , speak truth to power and accurately assess dynamics on the ground			0
we were not supposed to sugarcoat our analysis to make it more palatable or to cater to the audience with empty words or false optimism			0
we were trained to try to objectively assess and analyze the veracity of reporting to help inform policymakers ' decisions			0
so , while it may not be politically popular for a leader or a president to say that " we ca n't influence longer - term outcomes to the degree that we 'd like in @entity7 , so we are adopting a strategy to avert worst - case scenarios and contain catastrophe , " this is precisely the strategy we believe ought to be adopted right now			1
we need an honest strategy based on containing catastrophe			0
in other words , our strategy at this point ought to be designed to thwart the worst outcomes from occurring and it should focus on preventing moral , humanitarian and security catastrophes			0
the @entity13 can make a significant difference in the lives of @entity7 and in the realm of our own national security even if the future of @entity7 ultimately rests in hands of @entity7			1
the @entity123 , known by the acronym @entity125 , is on a rampage to take over and control territory			2
the @entity13 must degrade @entity125 capabilities so that it is unable to launch a significant terrorist attack on @entity13 interests ( or a large mass casualty attack anywhere in the world )			1
@entity125 is a product of @entity137 's organization dating back to the invasion of @entity7 in 2003			1
after @entity137 was killed in 2006 , the @entity125 emerged from his original organization and began to flourish			0
@entity125 has capitalized on ( former ) prime minister @entity141 's unwillingness to work with the local @entity143 populations and the power vacuum left by @entity146 's regime in @entity147			0
@entity125 and @entity137 's organization have thrived on sectarian violence , but @entity125 has managed to professionalize military and humanitarian aid			2
as @entity125 disperses and embeds in populated areas , it will become more difficult to root out			0
its possible achilles heel is the eventual erosion of local support from @entity143 while @entity125 asserts control to govern and maintain territory			0
this gives the @entity13 an opening to work with the @entity7 and @entity161 government , in addition to regional allies , by helping to resolve a humanitarian crisis and limiting the group 's ability to acquire new territory for safe haven			1
the @entity13 ought to continue targeted airstrikes with cooperation from @entity7 security forces and allies -- whether that takes days , weeks or months			1
second , we can and should prevent the potential for genocide or ethnic cleansing in @entity7			2
arguing that the @entity13 has n't acted in other areas of the world or ca n't act in every single case of violence is not an argument against acting when we are able to make a difference			2
and , we are able to make a difference right now in northern @entity7 at a moment of crisis -- such as the operation underway assisting those stranded and dying on @entity190 -- and we should also turn our eyes to the humanitarian crisis in @entity147 , where the @entity13 can also make difference			1
if the @entity13 can support the local population and help to bolster local governments , @entity125 will have a much more difficult time recruiting and controlling territory			1
@entity198 is an example of how successfully terrorist organizations can galvanize support and generate influence among local populations through charitable efforts			0
third , we must prevent terrorist groups operating in @entity7 and @entity147 from acquiring biological or chemical weapons that they would be able to use in a mass casualty attack			1
from a national security perspective , it 's important to remember @entity147 's @entity146 has not relinquished all of his chemical and biological weapons			1
the last thing we want is for these to fall in the hands of @entity125			0
why does the @entity13 intervene militarily in @entity7 but not in @entity147 ? fourth , @entity125 has attracted young fighters who understand how to talk to prospective recruits through all forms of media			1
some of those recruits are @entity221 passport holders and they are possibly the largest number of @entity221 citizens identified fighting alongside a terrorist organization			0
not only do they pose a threat in the region , individuals can also be difficult to track from the war theater when returning home			0
lastly , the @entity13 should work to maintain the security of its embassies and consulates			0
the recent evacuations and relocations of staff are a troublesome trend ( albeit for the safety and security of diplomatic personnel )			0
ensuring that our diplomats are able to safely operate and function in foreign countries , especially @entity7 , is critical			0
any type of serious attack on an embassy or @entity13 personnel working in the country would make it increasingly difficult for the @entity13 to address the issues we discuss above			2
in addition , maintaining a functioning embassy is important for information collection , assessing progress and being able to work with @entity7 -- particularly on the political side of the equation			0
a foreign policy strategy speech predicated on containing catastrophe might not be a speech that inspires the @entity13 public , but it is an honest strategy that would be based on a realistic approach to our foreign policy in @entity7			1
such an approach is good for @entity13 's national security and for addressing the humanitarian concerns of those suffering during crisis			1
join us on @entity270 / @entity269 .			0

former @entity83 analysts : after 10 years , @entity13 has limited ability to change things in @entity7
they say the @entity13 goal should be to contain the problem and prevent catastrophe
analysts : @entity13 is right to address humanitarian crisis on @entity190
@entity13 must ensure that @entity125 does n't acquire chemical , biological weapons , they say
