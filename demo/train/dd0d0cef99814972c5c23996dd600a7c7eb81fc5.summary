-- the phone call was short , and not at all sweet			1
" do you weigh more than 160 pounds ? " the voice on the other end asked @entity4			1
" yeah , i know i do , " she replied			1
@entity9 ' call to the local @entity11 recruiting center lasted less than five minutes			1
" i felt horrible , " she remembers			2
" i thought maybe i could change that			2
i did n't realize how big i actually was			2
" it was on a whale - watching trip to celebrate her 22nd birthday that @entity9 first toyed with the idea of joining the military			1
she noticed her fellow passengers on the boat were really enamored with the @entity21 patrolling nearby			2
at the time , @entity9 was working a part - time job in @entity23 , @entity24			1
she was n't having any luck getting student loans to go back to school and was having serious issues with her family			2
to deal with it , she turned to food , eating fast food during the day and binging on candy when she got home at night			2
chocolate was her drug of choice			2
sometimes with a side of ice cream			2
" i was realizing that the people who you thought were going to be there for you were n't at all , " she says			2
" the 5 - foot - 7 22 - year - old weighed 300 pounds			1
after the painful phone call , @entity9 started running every night around her neighborhood			1
a few months later she went to the @entity11 recruiting center in person			2
as she was about to enter , an @entity50 recruiter from the next office over called out to her			1
it was the first time @entity9 had ever seen a soldier up close			1
" i just sort of stared , " she says with a laugh , as the recruiter told her about their morning workout program for potential enlistees			2
she dragged a friend to the first training session			2
they started by running laps , then moved on to push - ups			0
@entity9 left shortly after the warm - up			1
" it does n't sound like much now , but at that point , oh my @entity66 , it made me throw up , " she says			0
the friends went to get milkshakes to make themselves feel better			0
it was two weeks before @entity9 gathered the courage to go back			1
no one from the @entity50 called her			1
her friend did n't push			0
" i just thought , if i 'm really serious i have to give it a shot			0
" she worked out with the group every day that week , monday through thursday			0
it was hard , but she realized she could do it			0
@entity9 started waking up at 4 a.m. every day to take a bus to the group 's morning workout			1
they run 2.5 to 4 miles , and then she heads to the gym before going to work			0
on tuesdays and thursdays she takes the bus back for an afternoon workout of jumping jacks , mountain climbers and push - ups			0
she also overhauled her diet , cutting out fast food , fried food and soda , and limiting her candy intake			0
every week she tries a new diet to keep it interesting -- one week she avoids carbohydrates ; another week she skips meat			0
a year and three months later , @entity9 has lost 110 pounds			1
she was sworn into the @entity50 on december 12			1
" i fell in love with their world , " she told @entity0 affiliate @entity100			0
" i fell in love with the bonds that i created with these people			0
i fell in love for what they stand for			0
" it was n't always easy			0
there were days when she would call sgt. @entity111 , the @entity112 , and quit			0
" i would go months without losing weight			1
it was so frustrating , " she says			0
" i remember ... just saying , ' i ca n't do this			0
i 'm never going to be small enough			0
' " but @entity111 never gave up on her			0
neither did @entity9 ' friends and roommates , who encouraged her to stay on track			1
today , @entity9 is " literally a walking @entity50 billboard			1
" her clothes , her room and her accessories are all advertisements for her new family			0
she 's looking forward to basic training , and plans to drop another 20 pounds			1
her advice to others who want to lose weight ? lie to yourself			1
" you love this feeling			0
because in the end , you will			0
" mission complete : 100 pounds gone			1

@entity4 wanted to join the military but did not meet the weight *requirements*
