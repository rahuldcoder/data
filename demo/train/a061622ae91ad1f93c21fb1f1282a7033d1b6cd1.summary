@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 ' headquarters aptly sits where the @entity5 corralled camels during the @entity8 , when @entity1 was a desert with no natural resources			1
a new film on @entity11 explores how the @entity13 family helped develop @entity0 through their newspaper			1
@entity0 ' development from an arid wasteland to a world metropolis and cultural capital is closely linked to the newspaper 's rise under the ownership of one family			1
" it would still be a desert , " documentary filmmaker @entity24 said , if gen. @entity25 did n't arrive in the 1880s to take over the bankrupt @entity4 and his son - in - law , @entity13 , was n't there to follow him			1
@entity24 ' documentary is a saga of four generations of the region 's most powerful family shaping @entity0 as they pursued their own civil agendas -- and accumulated wealth			1
" inventing @entity0 : the @entity38 and their times " premieres monday on @entity11			1
historian @entity40 said in the documentary that the @entity38 dominated @entity1 as no other family has dominated any major region of the @entity44			1
" they did not so much foster the growth of @entity0 as invent it , " said @entity40 , who died in 2007			2
@entity25 , @entity13 , @entity47 and @entity48 succeeded each other at the helm of the @entity4 over a span of 100 years			2
the city grew from a small desert town to the nation 's second - largest city , while the family became one of the nation 's wealthiest			1
the @entity13 family dynasty ended when the general 's great - grandson @entity48 was ousted as chairman of the @entity4 board of directors in 1985			1
the family eventually sold its @entity4 to @entity67 's @entity66 -- which is now in bankruptcy			2
each man 's personality and strengths were tailored for what was demanded of their time , said @entity24			0
" for each era , they were up to that particular era , " he said			0
" you could n't actually rearrange them , " said @entity13 's namesake and the great - great - grandson of the general			1
" you could n't have a @entity88 in late 20th - century @entity44 , " @entity13 told @entity2 , referring to the dynasty 's founder who served as an army general in the @entity86 before taking over the @entity4			1
" his character was one of the period			0
' i have a vision and everything i touch needs to support that vision and damn the consequences			0
' " @entity25 used his newspaper to scare the public about the threat of drought , drumming up support for a 230 - mile aqueduct -- one of the modern engineering marvels -- to divert water from the @entity105 to @entity0 , @entity24 said			1
he was part of a syndicate that bought vast tracts of barren land in the @entity110 with the inside knowledge the @entity112 would bring water there			0
the scandal later inspired @entity116 's award - winning film " @entity117			2
" @entity25 also used the @entity4 to influence the federal government 's decision to build the @entity120 , @entity24 said			0
" he had the foresight to say ' we have to build a man - made harbor here in @entity0 if we want to become a major port of trade , ' and today the @entity120 is the busiest port in the @entity44 , " @entity24 said			1
the general and his successor son - in - law promoted investment in and migration to the @entity0 area with stories of sunshine and opportunity			1
more people moving in meant more readers for their newspaper and demand for the real estate empire they were building			0
@entity25 and @entity13 used their newspaper to create a vision of @entity0 as " @entity44 's @entity144 " -- free of crime and communism			1
they fought a decades - long battle against labor unions -- a battle that included the 1910 bombing of the @entity4 headquarters			0
the @entity0 film , aviation , high technology , shipping and oil industries grew from the @entity38 ' influence , @entity24 said			1
as a conservative @entity160 family , they helped launch @entity162 's political career in @entity163			2
the story is not all about the men			0
@entity166 -- the strong - willed wife of @entity47 -- waged a relentless campaign to turn @entity0 into a world - class cultural center , @entity24 said			1
she led a campaign to raise money to save the @entity171 and the @entity172			0
in doing so , she brought together the @entity173 with the white @entity175 establishment based in @entity176 , @entity13 said			2
@entity177 , who became first nonfamily publisher of the @entity4 in 1980 , said one of @entity166 's " most remarkable " contributions was the successful effort to make sure her son @entity25 succeeded her husband as publisher in 1960			0
" the very new approach that @entity25 took and his leadership of the newspaper was just astounding , " @entity177 said in an interview with @entity2			0
@entity48 gave reporters editorial independence , opened news bureaus around the world and strengthened the paper 's coverage of the suburbs , @entity177 said			0
under @entity48 , it rose from being one of the worst major papers in the country to being one of the top three , @entity177 said			0
" it was his goal to make the @entity4 one of the best newspapers , and he did it in 20 years , being the right publisher at the right time , " @entity177 said			0
but @entity48 's transformation of the @entity4 from a conservative newspaper into a @entity209 - winning rival to the @entity210 and @entity211 angered many @entity13 family members			1
" some @entity213 were members of the @entity215 society ; his paper did an expose on it , " @entity177 said			0
@entity48 's newspaper looked closely at the @entity219 , " which had a reputation to shoot first and ask questions , " @entity177 said			2
the deep family rift eventually led to the sale of the @entity4 to the @entity66 -- and the end of the dynasty			2
@entity177 , who left the newspaper in 1989 and later became chairman of @entity2 , said the paper declined in the years since because " rather than going for people who were superb newspaper people , they went outside to pick people who , in my opinion , blew the place apart			0
" some @entity13 family descendants cooperated with @entity24 ' efforts to explore the @entity237 's dealings			1
" he does n't whitewash , but he does n't dig into the dark side and linger too long , " said @entity13 , the son of @entity48			2
the documentary is " on whole , a very balanced , very accomplished , incredibly well researched " documentary , @entity13 said			2
@entity24 said he avoided judging the motives of @entity242 and his successors			0
" when these guys were going about building the city , sometimes they did things , i would n't say in an underhanded way , but in a very private way , " @entity24 said			0
" how do you ascribe motives to people who did things 100 years ago ? was it for greed , avarice and duplicity ? history in general is this tangled web of good and evil			0

historian : *chandlers* not only dominated @entity0 , they invented it
@entity0 grew from small desert town to nation 's second - largest city
