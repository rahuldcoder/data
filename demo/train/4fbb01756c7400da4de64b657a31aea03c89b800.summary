a @entity1 will hear from @entity3 security officers who are expected to tell a much more detailed story about the terror attack in @entity6 , @entity7 , that killed ambassador @entity8 and three other @entity9 last year , @entity0 has learned			1
the men , described by sources as former @entity12 , former @entity13 and former @entity14 , were under contract to guard @entity3 agents on the ground there			0
the security officers were among those who responded when @entity8 ' compound was attacked on the night of september 11 , 2012			1
they will appear before lawmakers behind closed doors during the week of november 11 , sources told @entity0			0
members of @entity25 have been trying to get access to the security officers and @entity3 agents , but those attempts have failed to date			2
of the estimated nearly two dozen @entity3 operatives on the ground that night , only one has testified , the sources said			0
frustrated lawmakers have told @entity0 they have been dissatisfied with the investigation so far conducted by @entity35 chairman @entity34 , @entity36			0
his staff defends the work of the committee , telling @entity0 previously the review has included nine full committee hearings , roundtable discussions with some @entity45 administration officials , an interim report and a vow that the investigation continues			1
the members of @entity25 say they do n't want information that 's filtered like what they 've gotten in briefings and documents , but that they want to hear the answers to three basic questions straight from those who were there : one : what was the @entity3 doing in @entity7 ? there have been allegations the @entity3 was operating a gun - running program with weapons going from @entity7 to @entity63 rebels			1
two : what happened during the failed rescue attempts ? @entity0 has been told that there was a group of would - be rescuers at the @entity3 annex , armed and ready to go within minutes of the attack , but they were held off until finally they defied orders and staged a rescue on their own			2
sen. @entity74 pushes for answers three : did the administration know immediately that this was a planned terrorist attack ? and if so , why did administration officials try to first claim it was a spontaneous response to a demonstration over a movie that offended @entity83 ? " i think that there 's a real mystery here surrounding what really took place and for reasons unbeknownst to me , the @entity25 as well as the agency are going out of their way to protect whatever there was that they were doing operationally in @entity7 , " said @entity84 , a former @entity85 diplomatic security agent who has written a book about @entity6 that 's now being turned into an @entity88 movie			1
and sources say the @entity3 has been trying to keep its employees quiet			0
@entity0 reported previously that some operatives involved in the agency 's missions in @entity7 have been subjected to frequent -- even monthly -- polygraph examinations to find out whether they 've have spoken to @entity25 or the media , according to sources with deep inside knowledge of the agency 's workings			2
the @entity3 said in a statement this is " patently false			0
" " not a single @entity3 officer who was on the ground in @entity6 during the attacks has been subjected to any @entity3 polygraph intended to discourage them from speaking to @entity25 or as retaliation , " the agency told @entity0			1
" to date , some of these officers have already spoken to the oversight committees on @entity6 , " it added			0
commandos were poised for @entity7 raid to get @entity6 suspect			2
