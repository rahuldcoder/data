" @entity5 's story reminded me of my own , " says @entity2 actress and singer @entity1			1
" my own relatives , my family ancestors , were captured and forced into slavery			1
" captured in waters off @entity10 in 1970 , @entity5 is an orca -- a killer whale			1
@entity1 , who perceives clear parallels between @entity5 's life of captivity - for - profit and the human slave trade , was inspired to record " @entity17 : @entity18 , " a bold music video about @entity5 , and a courageous interview on the parallels of captivity between human slaves and performing orcas			1
@entity5 is still living in @entity25 at the @entity26			1
she 's been the focus of a concerted campaign to win her release			0
in january , @entity1 participated in a march in @entity26 that drew an impressive crowd estimated by the @entity32 to be around 1,000 people			1
can a killer whale be a slave ? literally ? " it 's important to understand how horrendous it is to steal a baby orca from her family , force her to perform , and hold her in the equivalent of a bath tank until she dies			1
it 's a crime , " @entity1 said			0
@entity5 has spent 44 years in a teacup			1
she is 20 feet long , living in a tank reportedly to be about 20 feet deep , 35 feet wide and 80 feet long			2
free - living orcas usually travel 25 to 75 miles per day			2
compared to say , 40 miles , 80 feet is about 1/2600th the size of an orca 's normal daily life			0
like a second lump of sugar , a whale named @entity51 who had been captured from the same free - living whale community two years earlier , shared @entity5 's teacup for 10 years			1
@entity51 died in 1980 after repeatedly ramming his head into the wall of the pool			0
did he commit suicide ? free - living orcas never do anything self - destructive			2
they have never even been seen fighting			0
at age 4 , she was taken from her mother			0
free - living orcas live their entire lives traveling with their mothers , siblings and children			2
unlike any other known creature , unlike elephants and humans , orcas like @entity5 never leave their birth family			1
free - living orcas frequently live into their 50s or beyond ( they can live up to a century )			2
they often cooperate and help one another , and may perform midwife duties			0
forty - year veteran orca expert @entity77 has told me that tooth marks on a recent healthy newborn suggest that another whale , likely its grandmother , assisted her daughter during a difficult birth by pulling the infant from her body			2
thousands of miles away , @entity5 's family has been without her			1
during these decades , the family desperately needed her			2
" the captures of young whales in the 1960s and ' 70s really caused a long - term problem , " @entity77 told me			0
the so - called " resident " orca families travel the @entity96 @entity95 off @entity10 , @entity97 and @entity98 hunting fish			1
before the captures they totaled about 120 whales			0
the captures took them down to about 70			0
they managed to rebuild to 99 whales by the 1990s			0
but when the whales removed as babies would have been the next maturing generation , rebuilding hit a wall : too few females			0
forty years later , the population — around 80 whales — is losing one or two members a year			0
the whole @entity96 resident population now has just two - dozen females of reproductive age			0
in some families , the only females are past reproductive age			0
@entity5 , who has never given birth , is now menopausal , her gifts to the future forever withheld by her denatured existence			1
by continuing to lure paying customers , @entity5 continues to make money for her owners			1
@entity129 , owner of the @entity26 , claims @entity5 can no longer survive in the wild			1
but that 's not the proposal			0
the proposal is to move her into a vastly larger open - water net - pen in her home waters of @entity10			1
there , she can be in vocal contact with her family			2
depending on how that goes and whether after all this time there remains recognition , the possibility of full return to her family could be considered			2
@entity5 's fish - hunting skills are by now somewhere between rusty and nonexistent , but free - living orcas routinely share food			1
bottom line : what 's proposed for her is better than the situation she is in			0
even death might seem preferable — as @entity5 's companion @entity51 seemed to think			1
" most of us have a clear understanding about the cruelty of slavery			0
it is imperative to recognize the inhumanity of forcing any living being into captivity			0

@entity163 : @entity5 , a captured killer whale , is living in @entity25 at the @entity26 in a confined space
@entity163 : @entity5 should be released into her home waters of @entity10 so she can be with her family
