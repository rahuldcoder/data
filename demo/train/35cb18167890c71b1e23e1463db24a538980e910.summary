-- each year billions of dollars are spent in the search to find new cancer drugs			1
very few of these would - be treatments end up being approved by the government and entering widespread use , which makes it all the more intriguing that one of the most promising new cancer drugs in years is , in fact , an old drug			1
@entity10 , a diabetes drug , was approved by the @entity12 in 1995 , and since then tens of millions of @entity13 with diabetes have taken it daily to control their blood sugar			1
the first hint that metformin might also have anticancer properties came a decade later , when two research teams separately reported that diabetes patients were less likely to develop cancer , and less likely to die from the disease , if they were taking the drug			1
this news was n't entirely surprising : @entity10 treats diabetes in part by lowering insulin levels , and several types of cancer -- such as those of the breast , colon , and prostate -- have been linked to high levels of that hormone			1
but then , in 2006 , researchers in @entity36 working with breast - cancer cells found that metformin increased the activity of an enzyme involved in tumor suppression , suggesting that the drug might fight cancer by working directly on cancer cells			1
@entity0 : know the warning signs of type 2 diabetes these two developments " set off a minor firestorm of interest , " says @entity48 , @entity49 , a breast cancer researcher at the @entity51			0
" basically there 's been a convergence of all this information , and even before it was available we could see there was a strong signal here			0
" over the past several years , studies in cell cultures and animals have found that metformin appears to slow or stop the growth of a wide range of cancer cells , including those associated with breast , prostate , lung , and endometrial cancer			2
and the pace of research has picked up			0
this week , at the annual meeting of the @entity78 ( @entity78 ) in @entity79 , researchers presented preliminary results from no fewer than 20 studies on metformin , including some in humans			0
" i think certainly over the last two or three years that metformin has come to the fore , and people recognize that it has an important role to play , " said @entity84 , @entity85 , a staff medical oncologist at @entity86 , in @entity87 , who presented new research at the meeting			0
@entity0 : 25 breast cancer myths busted the promising study findings are n't the only cause for enthusiasm among doctors			0
@entity10 's decades - long history as a diabetes drug -- it entered the @entity104 market back in 1958 -- suggests that it 's generally safe			1
it 's also extremely cheap			0
the @entity13 patent on metformin expired in 2002 , so the drug is now available in various generic versions that cost just pennies per pill			1
extensive placebo - controlled clinical trials will be needed before metformin can be used as a standard cancer treatment			1
while it 's too soon to say how that research will play out , metformin 's apparent versatility and low cost seems to offer unusual potential , says @entity121 , @entity49 , director of cancer prevention at @entity123 , in @entity124			1
" this is not a cancer drug development story like any other , " says @entity121 , who led the 2006 study on metformin and enzymes			1
" it contrasts so much with what you hear in cancer research : doctors developing new targeted therapy that costs $ 800 a month , and it works a little bit -- but only for certain kinds of patients with certain kinds of tumors			2
we do n't very often see [ that ] the generic drug that 's available at your drugstore anyways might have some use for cancer			1
" @entity0 : prescription drugs that lead double lives there may be a reason for that			0
pharmaceutical companies that spend billions to develop patented -- and expensive -- cancer drugs have little incentive to fund or conduct studies on generics like metformin			2
as a result , metformin researchers have struggled to scrape together the money needed for clinical trials , which can run into the millions			1
many of the ongoing metformin studies around the world are " being done on a shoestring budget , in a sort of informal way , " @entity121 says			0
" i imagine that if [ metformin ] was a proprietary drug owned by a major pharmaceutical company , they would be developing it very aggressively , because all of the indicators point in the same direction , and that 's unusual , " @entity167 says			2
governments and nonprofit organizations have begun to fill the money gap			0
the @entity179 ( @entity179 ) , for instance , is funding dozens of clinical trials that are currently under way or recruiting patients			2
one of these studies , led by @entity167 , is exploring the effect of metformin on breast - cancer recurrence in 3,582 women			1
the other major funders for the trial are the @entity191 and @entity192 , a generic drug maker that has agreed to provide free metformin and placebo pills			1
@entity0 : simple things that may cut your breast cancer risk a recent shift in thinking at the @entity200 ( @entity200 ) , which includes the @entity179 , seems to be working in metformin 's favor			2
in 2011 , @entity200 director @entity203 , @entity49 , said that " drug rescue and repurposing " would be a major focus of the agency , with the goal of investigating new uses for already approved or abandoned drugs			0
a few days later , the agency 's associate director for science policy , @entity213 , @entity49 , mentioned metformin as a prime example of this approach			0
two - thirds of the @entity179 - funded clinical trials of metformin now under way were initiated in 2011 or later			1
the preliminary research in humans has been encouraging			0
at the @entity78 meeting , @entity84 and his colleagues reported that cancer - cell growth seemed to slow in 22 men with prostate cancer who took metformin every day for three to four weeks before prostate cancer surgery			1
the study , however , did not include a placebo or control group			0
" the drug has potential in early - stage prostate cancer , " @entity84 says			1
" my job now is to work out the characteristics of the men who had the best response to the metformin so we can design appropriate studies			0
" in another study , researchers from the @entity244 , in @entity245 , found that metformin was associated with better outcomes in diabetes patients with pancreatic cancer , an especially aggressive form of cancer			2
the two - year survival rate was 30 % among the 117 patients taking metformin and just 15 % among 185 patients not on the drug			1
so far , most metformin research has focused on cancers related to obesity and diabetes , like pancreatic cancer , says @entity262 , a researcher at the center and the lead author of the study			2
but because metformin may stem cancer through several different channels -- by lowering insulin , directly slowing tumor growth , or promoting suicide by cancer cells -- it could potentially prove useful in many types of cancer			2
@entity0 : 12 myths about insulin and type 2 diabetes that possibility is a long ways from being confirmed , however , and in the meantime researchers investigating metformin temper their optimism with caution			0
" it 's not as fantastic as it sounds at first , " @entity121 says			0
" at first you see it and say , ' half the cancers are gone -- let 's put it in the drinking water			0
' " but the findings so far have n't shown that metformin directly reduces cancer risk or mortality in humans , @entity121 adds			0
in studies such as @entity262 's that have looked at cancer outcomes in diabetes patients , for instance , doctors may be prescribing metformin -- rather than insulin or other diabetes drugs -- only to their healthier patients , who may be less likely to develop or die from cancer anyway			2
moreover , even if some of metformin 's anticancer effects are confirmed in humans , there 's no guarantee the drug will become a useful treatment in real - world practice			1
" when we 're dealing with patients , we have to always be aware that [ metformin ] possibly could not have clinical relevance , " @entity167 says			0
" so we have to test it			0

@entity10 is now available in various generic versions that cost just pennies per pill
extensive trials will be needed before the drug can be used as a standard cancer treatment
the two - year survival rate was 30 % among the 117 patients taking metformin
