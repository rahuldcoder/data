@entity0 -- after a town hall meeting on health - care reform in @entity6 , @entity3 , president @entity2 will escape to @entity8 country on friday evening where he 'll spend time with family and go fly - fishing for the first time			1
@entity14 chief of staff @entity13 carries fly - fishing tackle to @entity16 on friday			1
fly - fishing requires a singular focus , much like golf			1
having newly discovered the sport myself , it occurred to me as i watched @entity16 lift off the @entity23 on friday that there are probably some lessons on the river that could apply to @entity2 's presidency			1
thinking like a producer , i called an expert -- fly - fishing instructor @entity29 , who described the evolution most fishermen go through			1
" usually , when you first go fishing , all you want to do is catch a fish , and then all you want to do is catch a lot of fish , and then you just want to catch the larger fish			2
after you 've caught a lot of large fish , you kind of go back to square one and catch just one fish , " said @entity29 , manager at @entity38 in @entity39 , @entity40			0
" you basically just want to go fishing -- the numbers , the size , it does n't matter any more			0
" @entity2 is in the " big fish " stage of his presidency : he 's trying to get health - care reform legislation passed hook , line , and sinker			1
if he 's successful , anything else he gets passed will be icing on the cake			0
learning the fundamentals of fly - fishing can serve as a metaphor for health care reform			1
@entity2 just needs to look at hooking and landing @entity62 and @entity63 like he would trout			0
the first step -- learn how to cast			0
" fly - casting is all about maximizing the energy you put in your rod and you lose energy if you wait too long , " @entity29 said			2
" and conversely , if you do n't wait long enough , your line will crack like a whip			0
" @entity2 has to strike the right balance between rushing things through and losing momentum ; and maintaining support while bringing others over to his side			0
the second step -- reading the water : " instead of blindly casting anywhere in the river you want to understand where you might find fish , " @entity29 explained			2
@entity2 zeroed in on a fairly conservative state , @entity3 , where he faces a land full of skeptics about his health care reform plan			0
third -- hook and land the fish : @entity29 said once you hook the fish you have to know how to play the fish , which is a delicate balance between applying pressure but not so much that the line breaks -- much like the delicate balance of @entity2 's courting members of @entity98			1
" the ultimate goal is to gain an advantage over the fish so that you can land him , " he said			0
" it 's the hardest thing to teach when it comes to fly - fishing , " he said			1
out in @entity3 , the game is catch - and - release trout			0
but in @entity0 , @entity2 is trying to hook @entity98 and take home health care reform , or risk it being the big one that got away .			2

@entity1 @entity14 producer : fly - fishing is a metaphor that fits @entity2 's presidency
beginning *anglers* desire to catch bigger and bigger fish , expert says
@entity2 is in the " big fish " stage of his presidency , @entity122 writes
