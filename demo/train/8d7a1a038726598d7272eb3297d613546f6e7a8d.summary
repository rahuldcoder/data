-- president @entity1 and his family arrived friday for a weekend getaway in @entity4 , but along with a little rest and relaxation comes criticism that the president is taking it easy with the @entity10 oil crisis in a critical phase			1
the @entity12 plan to spend the weekend on @entity13 , home of @entity14			2
the trip marks the president 's third weekend vacation since the oil disaster began in april			1
the @entity19 launched a website blasting what it considers @entity1 's " leisure activities or missteps " during the oil disaster , like playing golf , attending concerts and vacationing in @entity27 , @entity28 ; @entity29 , @entity30 ; and now @entity4			1
@entity1 has also faced criticism for scheduling a trip up north , instead of vacationing in the @entity10 , as he advised other @entity33 to do			1
" presidents are certainly entitled to vacation , just like everybody else , but there is a fine line as to when presidents should do it , what they should and where they should do it , " said @entity34 , a former member of president @entity37 's senior staff and the deputy assistant for appointments and scheduling			1
" presidents have to be cognizant of the fact that everything they do is going to be scrutinized , " said @entity51 , who also is a professor for @entity53 's semester in @entity55 program			0
@entity60 strategist @entity59 said the @entity19 criticism is " galling , " considering @entity37 's frequent trips to @entity63 and his home in @entity65 , @entity66			1
" @entity1 is working as hard as any president that we 've had in recent history and certainly harder than the most immediate previous president , " he said			2
@entity73 's @entity72 , who keeps track of presidents ' comings and goings , calculated that @entity37 spent all or part of 977 days at @entity63 or in @entity66 during his two terms			2
@entity51 noted that visits to those locations were working trips and not getaways			0
@entity37 's staff would travel with him , and work would continue as usual			1
the @entity65 ranch was known as the " western @entity87 " because of the infrastructure there			0
as for calls that @entity1 should vacation in the @entity10 , @entity59 said , " where he chooses to take his days off should really be up to him			0
we do n't want to get into a situation where the president is making familial vacation decisions based upon polling or political maneuvers			0
" @entity99 , @entity37 's deputy press secretary who often traveled with the president when he was away from the @entity87 , said that changing locations provided a good opportunity to escape the hustle and bustle of @entity55			1
" president @entity37 , on the weekends , would often go to @entity63 because the size of the bubble you are in expands , so you can go out for a walk or bike ride without having to arrange security detail , " he said			2
@entity99 was in @entity65 with @entity37 for a number of crises that could not have been planned for , like the conviction of @entity117 , the death of president @entity119 and the assassination of @entity122 politician @entity121			2
@entity37 was notified of @entity121 's death immediately and delivered a statement to the press pool			0
" it would have almost been like we were at the @entity87 in terms of the teams that would convene and talk about the issues surrounding that assassination , " @entity99 said			0
the problem for @entity1 , @entity99 said , is the visuals that could come out of his trip			0
a picture of @entity1 playing golf alongside images from the @entity10 could send a negative message			0
@entity139 , a @entity0 contributor and former adviser to president @entity142 , said that vacationing or not , " the president is the president wherever he is			1
" i thought it was silly when people attacked @entity37 for going on vacation , so i 'll be consistent and say it 's silly when people attack president @entity1 for going on vacation , " he said			1
" of all of the concerns that @entity33 may have , they do not need to worry whether president @entity1 is a hard - working man			0
they may agree or disagree with his policies , but there is just no doubt that the guy is busting his rear end			0
