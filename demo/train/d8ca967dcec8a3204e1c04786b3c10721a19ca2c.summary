@entity0 -- @entity3 's parole board convened monday morning to hear a last - minute appeal by @entity5 , who is set to die by lethal injection for the murder 21 years ago of a @entity9 police officer			1
a jury convicted @entity5 of murder in 1991 , paving the way for his execution , which has been delayed three times and is now scheduled for 7 p.m. wednesday at a state prison in @entity16 , @entity3			1
the @entity17 noted in a press release sunday it is " the sole authority in @entity3 for granting clemency to inmates			0
" options for the board include commuting a death sentence without parole , giving a convict a life sentence or denying clemency -- which , in this case , would pave the way for @entity5 ' execution			1
in addition to @entity5 and his supporters making their appeal , the victim 's mother , @entity33 , told @entity1 this weekend that she , too , plans to attend			1
many of @entity5 ' supporters , who believe he was wrongly convicted and have staged rallies in recent days calling for his release , will not be allowed in			2
but in a statement sunday , officials with @entity43 , the @entity44 and @entity45 for @entity46 issued a fresh appeal for people to join them monday for prayers , musical performances and speeches outside the building where the board will meet			0
according to these groups , there have been about 300 rallies , vigils and events worldwide since last week			0
in addition , they say that more than 1 million people have signed a petition in support of @entity5 ' bid to be exonerated			1
since his 1991 conviction , seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted or contradicted their testimony			0
there also have been questions about the physical evidence -- and , according to some , the lack thereof -- linking @entity5 to the killing			2
but the mother of @entity78 , the police officer killed that night , said that those rallying do n't understand all the facts of the case			1
she is convinced that @entity5 shot her son , and that the jury 's decision to convict him was fair			1
" i 'm not out after blood , i 'm after justice , " said @entity33 , adding she does n't plan to attend the execution			0
" i want my son to rest in peace			0
" in a 2008 statement , then - @entity91 district attorney @entity90 described how @entity5 was at a pool party in @entity9 when he shot another man , @entity94 , in the face			1
@entity5 was then driven to a nearby convenience store , where he pistol - whipped a homeless man , @entity97 , who 'd just bought a beer			2
soon thereafter , prosecutors said @entity33 -- who was working in uniform , off - duty , at a nearby bus station and restaurant -- arrived			0
it was then , the jury determined , that @entity5 shot the officer three times , including once in the face as he stood over him			1
@entity5 ' lawyers , in a petition to a @entity109 @entity108 , insisted that there is " no physical evidence linking " @entity5 to @entity33 's murder			1
they point , too , to " the unremarkable conclusion " of a ballistics expert who testified that he could not find definitively that the bullets that wounded @entity94 and killed @entity33 were the same			0
@entity3 's attorney general , in an online statement , claims that the expert said the bullets came from the same gun type and noted that casings at the pool party shooting matched -- thus came from the same firearm as -- those found at @entity33 's murder scene			1
two decades ago , a jury convicted @entity5 on two counts of aggravated assault and one each of possessing a firearm during a crime , obstructing a law enforcement officer and murder			1
the latter charge led , soon thereafter , to his death sentence			0
while reviewing @entity5 ' claims of innocence last year , the @entity139 for the @entity140 found that @entity5 " vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence			2
" " some of the evidence is not credible and would be disregarded by a reasonable juror , " judge @entity147 wrote in a 172 - page opinion			0
" other evidence that mr. @entity5 brought forward is too general to provide anything more than smoke and mirrors , " the court found			2
the rev. @entity155 , who is set to testify before the parole board monday , said that he " can only begin to imagine the pain ( the @entity33 family ) must be feeling			1
" @entity33 " was protecting the community , and there is no pain greater than when a parent loses a child , " @entity155 said			0
still , he believes " there is too much doubt in this case for an execution			0
" " i have met with ( @entity5 ) on death row , " @entity155 said			2
" i believe he is innocent			0
" the odds do not appear to be in @entity5 ' favor			2
the parole board denied him clemency once before			1
and the board has never changed its mind -- on any case -- in the past 33 years .			0
