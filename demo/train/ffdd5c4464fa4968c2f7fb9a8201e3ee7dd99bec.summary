-- when the @entity4 @entity3 candidate who said " legitimate rape " rarely resulted in pregnancy canceled plans to appear on @entity0 's " @entity8 , " the @entity0 chat show host did not hurriedly book another guest for his monday night show			1
instead , the program turned its cameras on an empty chair			2
" congressman , " the @entity0 host addressed rep. @entity15 , a @entity16 @entity4 , " you have an open invitation to join me in that chair whenever you feel up to it			2
" if you do n't keep your promise to appear on the show , then you are what we would call in @entity26 a gutless little twerp			0
" opinion : it 's not just @entity15 within minutes , the phrase " gutless little twerp " was streaking around the @entity32 , and the @entity34 stunt garnered @entity36 's ultimate accolade -- a parody account			1
@ @entity38 began churning out criticism of @entity15 and the presumptive @entity4 @entity41 ticket of @entity42 and @entity43 , along with puns like : " i am not going to sit out this @entity3 race			1
" " if @entity15 wins will he be the @entity48 ( chair ) @entity50 ? " the satirist tweeted later			0
high - profile media figures including @entity52 of @entity53 jumped on the bandwagon , and @entity34 himself gave the account a shout - out			1
throughout the show , @entity34 kept up the live picture of the " empty chair " in the corner of the screen with a banner that said " @entity64			0
" clock ticking for @entity15 as @entity4 urges him to withdraw @entity15 's comments : send your thoughts , testimonies but not everyone was a fan of the stunt , with @entity72 of the right - wing @entity73 tweeting : " i think the empty chair is out - debating @entity34			2
" @entity15 , an uncompromising opponent of abortion , made his controversial comment in an interview with @entity79			0
later , he tried to roll back			0
@entity15 's remarks deemed ' harmful ' to rape survivors " in reviewing my off - the - cuff remarks , it 's clear that i misspoke in this interview and it does not reflect the deep empathy i hold for the thousands of women who are raped and abused every year , " @entity15 said in a written statement			0
@entity15 's remarks caused an uproar , prompting many in his party asking him to withdraw from the @entity3 race			1
" the chair has a better chance of being elected , " tweeted @entity94 , an editor at @entity96 magazine			0
@entity15 is hoping to unseat @entity16 's @entity100 sen. @entity99 , who got her own parody account in the wake of @entity34 's show			1

the stunt *immediately* *sparks* a @entity36 parody account
