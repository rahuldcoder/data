it was a journey that those who lost their lives in @entity3 would never make			0
seventy bags of soil , one from each of the @entity8 cemeteries and battlefields in @entity3 , @entity10 , have arrived in @entity11 on a @entity10 @entity13 frigate , where they will form part of a memorial garden to remember those who died in the bloodshed of @entity18 as part of a somber ceremony attended by @entity24 and @entity10 dignitaries alike , the bags of soil were moved friday onto a decomissioned @entity24 warship , @entity26			1
on saturday they were being taken to @entity28 near @entity29			1
there they will complete the symbolic memorial garden forming a circular soil bed that references the opening in the roof of the @entity36 in @entity37 , from which poppies rain down each year on november 11 , and bears the words of @entity41 's famous poem , " in @entity42			1
" but the public will have to wait a while before they can visit the garden , which opens on 9 november 2014 immediately after the @entity48 ceremony to coincide with the 100th anniversary of the start of @entity18 i. for @entity53 , curator of the @entity54 and brainchild of the project , the garden is about emphasizing the importance of remembrance to younger generations			1
" the fact that you and i can stand here today as free people , to have free thoughts and to do free actions : somebody actually fought and died for that freedom that we enjoy today , " he told @entity60			0
" there was a generation of people who marched away from @entity28 and never came home			2
" if we are to get the generation of tomorrow to understand what this is about , for us to pass the torch of remembrance to them , we have to help them understand the significance of this sacrifice			0
" the memorial garden is just one manifestation of a bond between the @entity24 and @entity10 that predates the battles of @entity18 the @entity90 , an infantry regiment of the @entity89 , can be traced back to 1656 when it formed in @entity91 to protect the exiled @entity92 , and it was the @entity93 that liberated @entity10 at the end of @entity95 the initial idea was hatched five and a half years ago after @entity98 's @entity97 , but @entity53 admits pulling off the project has been a challenge			1
" it takes a very long time to get planning permission for something like this right in the heart of royal @entity11 , and to get all the various agencies involved to give their agreement			2
" it 's been an uphill struggle , but we 're there now and we 're very grateful for everyone for their support			0
" however , the project is only just over halfway towards reaching its funding goal of £ 700,000 ( $ 1,150,000 ) and for the rest @entity53 is looking closer to home than @entity119			0
" the @entity10 people have already produced £ 420,000 , " he said			2
" so it 's time for the @entity123 to step up and help us complete this unique memorial to the fallen			0
