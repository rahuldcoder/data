a crowd estimated at more than 10,000 people marched silently on a bitterly cold day through downtown @entity2 thursday to commemorate the five year anniversary of the murder of an ethnic @entity6 journalist @entity5			1
they walked carrying a sea of black signs declaring " we are all @entity5 , we are all @entity6 , " written in @entity10 and @entity6			1
police , who put the crowd estimate at 10,000 or more , blocked off traffic as the crowds moved towards the offices of the @entity6 language @entity18 newspaper			1
on january 19 , 2007 , @entity5 , the newspaper 's editor in chief , was gunned down in broad daylight on the sidewalk outside the newspaper 's offices			1
@entity5 , in the opinion of observers , had been an eloquent spokesman for @entity10 's tiny minority of @entity6			1
a 17 - year - old @entity10 ultra nationalist soccer player was caught with the murder weapon and later convicted of the killing			1
but on tuesday an @entity2 court attracted condemnation from members of the @entity5 family as well as human rights groups when 19 suspected accomplices in the murder where all acquitted of charges of being members of a terrorist organization that plotted the assassination			1
" the verdict was not only a travesty of justice , it shows our justice system is simply political and does not work , " said newspaper columnist @entity42 , as she marched along with her mother and thousands of others up @entity2 's @entity46 , the broad boulevard where @entity5 was shot dead			1
" so many journalists are in jail charged with terrorism only because of their writing , " @entity53 added , " whereas the actual guys who killed a journalist and who had clear connections with state officials ... they 're not charged with terrorism			0
some are even let go			0
" according to the @entity66 there are currently more than 90 media workers behind bars , many of them facing charges of alleged membership in terrorist organizations and coup plots to overthrow the government			0
a @entity76 member from @entity10 's ruling party added to the chorus of criticism thursday in a newspaper column describing the trial as a " disgrace			0
" " apart from offending our civic conscience and eroding our limited trust in justice in this country , tuesday 's verdict is also an insult to this nation 's intelligence , " wrote lawmaker @entity83 in the @entity86 - language @entity84			0
" despite the clear evidence that confirms links with state officials both before and after @entity5 's murder , it is clear that the deep state wants this link to be covered up			2
" " deep state " is the term many @entity10 use to refer to alleged criminal networks within security forces and the government bureaucracy			0
many members of the crowd of thousands carrying portraits of @entity5 on thursday chanted " fascist state			1
" before his murder @entity5 was on trial for " insulting @entity114 " because he referred to the @entity116 - era massacre of hundreds of thousands of ethnic @entity6 as genocide			1
the @entity10 government vehemently rejects using that term to refer to that bloody chapter of history			0
but while attracting the anger of @entity10 ultra-nationalists , @entity5 was also outspoken in his defense of freedom of speech			2
three months before his murder , @entity5 gave an interview to @entity128 @entity127 , in which he argued against a proposed law in @entity130 to make the denial of the @entity6 genocide a crime			2
" those who use this @entity6 issue as a political tool are massacring my people over and over again , " @entity5 said			2
in that october 2006 interview , @entity5 also warned that he had received multiple death threats			2
according to a prosecutor 's indictment , within days of @entity5 's shooting , the chief murder suspect @entity140 , was caught by police in possession of the murder weapon and the white knit hat that he was filmed wearing by a security camera , positioned on the street where @entity5 was killed			0
after he was detained , several @entity10 police officers filmed themselves treating @entity140 like a hero			0
a video that was later widely re-broadcast on @entity10 television networks showed the officers posing alongside @entity140 , after positioning him prominently in front of a @entity10 flag .			0
