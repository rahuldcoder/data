" " we are all hurting , " pastor @entity12 of @entity13 in @entity14 told @entity0 's @entity15 on tuesday			1
" that voice is silenced			1
but she left us with so much			2
" earlier in the day , @entity18 -- the owner of @entity19 in the northern @entity6 city -- said that @entity3 's funeral will start at noon saturday at that church			1
@entity12 said that he 'll officiate what he described as a " small ... invite - only service			1
" the church seats a maximum of 1,500 people , and the pastor said he expects " all these empty pews to be filled with people whose hearts are broken			1
" " she was able to leave us with so many wonderful memories of that @entity35 - given gift , " he said			2
" that 's what we are celebrating on saturday			2
" at the request of the late singer 's mother @entity40 , the eulogy will be given by @entity42 , a gospel singer and pastor at @entity45 's @entity44 , @entity12 later told @entity0 's @entity46			1
@entity47 officiated @entity3 's 1992 marriage ceremony to @entity50 singer @entity49			1
@entity6 gov. @entity51 told reporters tuesday that he planned to issue an executive order so that flags at government buildings throughout the late entertainer 's native state would fly at half - staff on the day of her funeral			1
there will be no large - scale public memorial in @entity14 in the immediate aftermath of @entity3 's death , city spokeswoman @entity60 said			1
the funeral director at the @entity19 told city officials that the family did not want a big memorial , according to @entity60			0
@entity12 , the @entity70 pastor , said organizers hope to set up a large screen outside his church , so people who can not get inside can see the funeral proceedings			1

late monday , her body arrived at the @entity19 -- borne by a hearse and escorted by police -- as a large crowd looked on			1
@entity40 , the late singer 's mother , was waiting inside , police said			1
@entity70 's pastor described @entity40 -- herself a well - known gospel singer who was active at the church -- as a " strong , strong woman			1
" " her heart is broken : nobody expects to bury her child , " @entity12 said			0
" but she is managing it with miraculous strength			0
she is so grateful for prayers and thoughts , and that 's holding her together			2
" @entity3 , 48 , was found dead saturday in her suite at the upscale @entity103 , just hours before she was scheduled to attend a pre-grammy bash at the hotel			0
why she died remains a mystery			0
despite widespread media speculation , a @entity108 coroner official monday downplayed the suspicion that drugs played a major role			2
assistant chief coroner @entity113 said that " not many prescription bottles " were found in the singer 's room after her death			1
the amount of medications recovered by investigators was less than what is usually present in deaths attributed to overdoses , @entity113 said			0
" i know there are reports that she maybe was drowned or did she overdose , but we wo n't make a final determination until all the tests are in , " he said			0
@entity113 ruled out foul play and said there were no injuries to @entity3 's body			2

" the friend said @entity3 was taking medication for a throat infection and @entity149 for anxiety and to help her sleep			0

@entity3 : a mother , a daughter , a friend @entity3 's body was released to her family monday , a day after an autopsy was conducted in @entity108			0

that report 's conclusions into what @entity208 now describes as an " unattended , unexpected death " will drive what investigators do next , the police spokesman said			1
@entity207 police have requested a " security hold " on the coroner 's report , a common practice in high - profile cases that limits what can be revealed about an investigation while it is ongoing			1
reverend : the @entity3 i knew asked how long @entity3 had been dead before she was found , @entity113 said she only that she was seen alive within an hour of her death			0
