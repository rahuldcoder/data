-- when @entity2 ended his 30 - month wait for a @entity5 title in march , the golf world was excited by the prospect of the 14 - time major champion blitzing the @entity9 field on his old stomping ground at @entity11			1
he flopped , finishing tied for 40th			1
woods then missed the cut at @entity14 and shared 40th at the @entity15			0
so what can we expect at next week 's @entity19 , where he has already been installed as the oddsmakers ' favorite after thrilling fans with his 73rd @entity5 title on sunday , chipping in with one of the best shots of his career ? " the timing could n't have been better , it means a lot for him to win in front of his hero @entity35 , " says @entity29 deputy editor @entity28			1
" if he plays at that level , if he 's able to hit fairways and find the putting stroke that he showed in @entity39 , then @entity2 is definitely going to be one of the contenders at the @entity19			1
" that can only be good for golf			2
the @entity5 's broadcaster @entity44 reported that sunday 's ratings increased 138 % from last year , being the event 's best result since 2004			1
the season 's second major will be held at the @entity50 in @entity51 , where @entity2 revealed he practiced the week before going to @entity35 ' @entity52			1
" i hit the ball well there			0
i said , ' hey , that 's as good a prep as any for this event , if i can hit the ball well there			2
' i just basically carried that into this event and hit it great all week			2
" @entity2 acknowledged that his victory at the @entity63 had covered up some of the deficiencies in his game before the masters as he was still coming to terms with his new swing			1
" at @entity69 i played well on that sunday , but i just did n't quite have the control i did here			2
i 'm able to hit the ball , i think , compressing it higher than i did at @entity69 , " he told reporters			0
" i was comfortable hitting it down , uncomfortable hitting it up			0
as i said at @entity11 to you guys , i got exposed , was n't able to get the ball up in the air comfortably , and it showed			0
" i went to work on it for the next few weeks , and i finally got it			0
it came around here when i needed it			0
this is a high - ball golf course			2
you 've got to get the ball up in the air and you 've got to land it soft , and i did it			0
" while the technique being instilled by coach @entity94 is finally paying off for @entity2 , @entity28 says more importantly the 36 - year - old is rediscovering the " x-factor " that made him the world 's best - paid athlete			1
" he 's got his putter going a little bit , he was hitting fairways , and as we saw with that shot on 16 it would be appear that there 's a level of magic surrounding this guy that he 's able to summon			2
not as consistently as he used to , but it 's still there , " @entity28 told @entity0			2
" obviously the technique has to be there , he has to put the club face on the ball and to execute his shot , but golf probably more than any other sport relies on the proverbial 15th club -- which is the confidence between your ears that you can pull this off			0
" @entity2 obviously has a lot of confidence right now , and he should -- there 's only a couple of other players on the @entity129 @entity5 this season who have two wins , and he 's one of them along with @entity133 and @entity134			1
" @entity28 believes that the way is clear for @entity136 to win his first major title since 2008 , when he famously triumphed at the @entity19 in a playoff despite suffering a serious knee injury that would sideline him for the rest of that year			1
" we 've seen @entity142 miss three straight cuts , we 've seen ( world no. 1 ) @entity145 not really be much of a factor , and ( five - time @entity19 runner - up ) @entity146 having to pull out ( at @entity149 ) citing fatigue , " @entity28 said			1
" @entity2 then wins his 73rd championship and it 's so tantalizing a story that leading up to the @entity19 next week that his form once again seems to be ramping up			1
" the tournament was last held at @entity50 in 1998 , when a 23 - year - old @entity2 tied for 18th			1
" it 's way different than in ' 98			0
they 've added some serious length there , " he said			0
" we were hitting different clubs off the tees and different sight lines , and they 've shifted a couple of the fairways over , and all new green complexes			0
you know , my book is useless from ' 98			0
" so what does @entity2 think -- is he really back ? " i 'll just keep going , keep working on it			1
this is a process , and i 'm just trying to get better			0

@entity2 is favorite to win the @entity19 starting next week in @entity51
former world no. 1 tied @entity35 on 73 @entity5 victories on sunday
golf *journalist* says @entity2 has run into form at just the right time
@entity2 says his practice at @entity19 's @entity50 venue set him up for victory
