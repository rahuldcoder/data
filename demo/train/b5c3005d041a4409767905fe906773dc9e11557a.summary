sen. @entity0 , @entity1 , hit back at sen. @entity2 , @entity3 , monday for his comments that @entity0 does n't know what he is talking about when it comes to net neutrality			1
@entity0 used a video that he uploaded to @entity10 and social media that shows the senator explaining what net neutrality is and how it works			1
" what happens when government starts regulating a service as a public utility ? it calcifies everything			0
it freezes it in place , " @entity0 says , in a clip from a speech he delivered friday in @entity25			2
" let 's give a simple contrast			0
the @entity29 of 1934 was adopted to regulate these , " @entity0 says holding up a landline phone			1
" to put regulations in place and what happened ? it froze everything in place			0
this ( @entity0 puts his hand on the landline phone ) is regulated by @entity40 ( @entity0 holds up a cell phone ) is not			1
" " your smartphone , the @entity45 , the apps -- all of this is outside of @entity48 , " @entity0 continues			0
" the innovation is happening without having to go to government regulators and say , ' mother , may i ? ' we want a whole lot more of this ( @entity0 holds up a cell phone ) and a whole lot less of this ( @entity0 points at the landline phone )			1
" the @entity0 explainer video is titled " how net neutrality hurts the internet explained			1
" it was circulated in response to @entity2 's suggestion on sunday that @entity0 does n't know what he 's talking about when it comes to net neutrality			1
@entity2 , who chairs the @entity68 , said @entity0 's previously stated analogy that net neutrality is like " @entity71 " makes no sense			1
" he has it completely wrong and he just does n't understand what this issue is , " @entity2 told @entity74 's @entity73 on sunday			1
net neutrality protesters sing , chant at @entity81 chairman 's home at issue are proposed " fast lanes , " or opportunities for big companies to pay @entity45 providers more money to make their websites operate at a quicker speed			2
but opponents , including president @entity91 , favor keeping things equal -- also known as net neutrality -- so that wealthier businesses do n't have an advantage over smaller ones when it comes to paying for faster websites			2
" @entity71 was a government program that fixed something , that changed things , " @entity2 said			0
" this is about reclassifying something so it stays the same			0
this would keep things exactly the same that they 've been			0
" to prevent " fast lanes , " @entity91 urged the @entity81 to implement more regulations -- something @entity109 do n't want			0
@entity91 puts foot down : no @entity45 fast lanes @entity0 said last week on @entity111 that net neutrality is " the biggest regulatory threat to the @entity45			1
" " in short , net neutrality is @entity71 for the @entity45 , " he continued			0
" it puts the government in charge of determining internet pricing , terms of service , and what types of products and services can be delivered , leading to fewer choices , fewer opportunities , and higher prices for consumers			0
" responding to @entity2 's comments , @entity0 's communications director said monday that " allowing the government to regulate the internet as a public utility would freeze innovation and prevent progress			2
" " it 's radical and extreme to put the future of the internet in the hands of a five - member @entity81 panel influenced by lobbyists and politicians and unaccountable to regular , working @entity144 , " @entity134 said , while also pointing to a recent speech by @entity0 about net neutrality .			2
