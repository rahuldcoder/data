-- @entity1 is not having a good year			1
as the company scrambles to get the @entity5 and @entity6 music service back online , it 's suffering from yet another security breach			1
this time it 's a hacker attack on various websites associated with @entity10			0
a team of individuals going by the name @entity14 , who recently managed to deface @entity17 's homepage , announced that they have broken into @entity18 and compromised more than 1 million user accounts			1
an additional 75,000 music codes and 3.5 million coupons were also uncovered			0
the attack , part of a campaign known as @entity25 , was announced on @entity26 and on the @entity14 website			1
@entity14 said that it did n't have enough resources to copy all the data that it was able to access			1
but the group did manage to grab a collection of databases that contain thousands of usernames			0
the accounts , presumably associated with any sort of registered activity on @entity18 ( or its subsidiaries or partners ) , contain information like passwords , email addresses , dates of birth and other @entity1 opt - in data			1
this certainly is n't as dangerous as the information that was exposed during the @entity5 hack , but it could still be used to gather access to more important accounts elsewhere			2
the scariest part of this attack is n't what was taken , but how easy it was for the @entity14 members to take it			2
according to the groups own press release , access to the main @entity10 website was gained using a very basic tactic called a sql injection			0
we have n't had a chance to examine the released files to see what this injection was , but it 's likely that an out - of - date software stack and relatively unprotected web server made passing the injection trivial			0
@entity14 says that all of the information it took was unencrypted			2
" @entity1 stored over 1,000,000 passwords of its customers in plaintext , " says the hackers ' press release , " which means it 's just a matter of taking it			2
" seeing as this is the second security breach of a major @entity1 - branded website in just outside of a week , we have to ask : is anyone at @entity1 employed to handle web security ? sure , managing a large number of brands and properties that are often connected in name only has to be a challenge , not to mention the logistical and administrative challenges of managing websites that can store millions of user profiles			1
still , that does n't make up for what by all appearances is an abysmal security record			0
@entity14 has been on a tear , infiltrating the websites and databases for the @entity102 television program , " @entity103 , " parts of @entity105 , @entity106 and many parts of @entity17 in the past three weeks alone			2
the attacks , while often juvenile in nature and execution ( the @entity112 website plays the theme from " the @entity114 " ) , underscore just how important it is for brands to keep their web servers updated , hardened and monitored			1
in the age of simple publishing tools like @entity121 , it 's easy for managers to underestimate the importance of having someone on contract or on staff to keep data encrypted and protected			0
we can only hope the most recent cyber attacks convince executives to think seriously about investing in online security			0
