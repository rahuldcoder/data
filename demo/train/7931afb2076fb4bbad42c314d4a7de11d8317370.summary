a senior @entity3 official said the employees would be assigned to different jobs , and an agency spokeswoman followed up by saying that an independent review of the matter found problems and raised questions but did not conclude any breach of duty			2
" clearly things could have been done better			0
i think that 's patently obvious to everybody who 's followed this for almost a year now , " said deputy @entity3 spokeswoman @entity26			0
" we have to let the facts lead where they may , and these are people with real lives and real careers , and we ca n't just take action that 's not warranted against them just to make us all feel better			0
" the sanctioned employees included @entity40 , who the @entity3 said had resigned from his post as assistant secretary for diplomatic security but remained with the department while on leave			2
the other three were not identified			0
it was not clear what new responsibilities @entity40 and the other three would be given			0
@entity50 chairman @entity49 , who has pressed the @entity3 to punish employees who lawmakers contend ignored security warnings in advance of the attack last september 11 , reacted sharply to the decision by secretary of state @entity57			1
" instead of accountability , the @entity3 offered a charade that included false reports of firings and resignations and now ends in a game of musical chairs where no one misses a single day on the @entity3 payroll , " @entity49 said			0
he said his committee would expand its investigation to include how the independent analysis of events by the @entity71 resulted in @entity57 deciding " not to pursue any accountability from anyone			2
" the four employees were placed on leave after the review board in december uncovered bureaucratic failures at the @entity3 before the attack			1
lawmaker : if @entity1 can interview suspect in attack , why ca n't @entity80 ? @entity57 ordered a review the board 's report and studied the workers ' careers			1

" the @entity8 incident involved scores of militants using rocket - propelled grenades and other weapons against the @entity7 diplomatic compound and a nearby predominantly @entity107 - run annex			1
ambassador @entity108 and three other @entity7 were killed			2
the attack has become a flashpoint in the partisan - fueled climate in @entity0 with @entity112 , especially , criticizing the @entity115 administration 's handling of security beforehand and botching the response after			1
@entity8 attack timeline rep. @entity119 , a @entity120 @entity112 , told @entity1 's @entity121 in an interview on ' @entity123 ' that someone has to be held accountable			1

senator @entity132 of @entity133 , the top @entity112 on the @entity134 , said , " i do n't understand how this administration will ensure accountability at one of our most vital government departments without disciplining those who fail in their duties			0
