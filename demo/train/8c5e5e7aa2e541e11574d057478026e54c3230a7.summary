@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 conducts weekly rounds at the @entity5 not in a white coat and stethoscope , but in street clothes and carrying , quite often , an armful of cds , @entity12 flutes and even instruments she has designed herself			1
although @entity15 is a musician , not a medical doctor , her role as director of the hospital 's arts - in - medicine program is perhaps no less integral to the care and healing of some of the institution 's sickest patients			1
" it is often the case that seriously ill patients are suffering from things that can not be relieved with pills or procedures , " says @entity3 , who founded the program in 2002			1
" we listen for what those things are and try to address them			0
" a troupe of actors , dancers , writers , musicians , visual artists and movement specialists rove the different sections of the hospital			2
painters might be found on any given day in the cancer center , dancers in the psychiatric unit and harpists providing musical sustenance on any given floor			0
their mission is to facilitate " creative encounters " that can help patients and their families discover new meaning in life and death , or " just for fun , " as @entity15 puts it			1
sometimes , this can be as simple as playing music at a patient 's bedside to help them calm down or sleep			2
recently , a volunteer in @entity15 's program encountered a woman in her 50s paralyzed from the neck down			2
the woman used to be a painter but could no longer handle a brush or paints and had been labeled a " problem " patient			0
the artist offered to act as the patient 's hands , drawing a picture as directed by the bedridden woman			0
" the painting was lovely but , better yet , it really brought the patient alive and really turned around the situation , " recalls @entity3			0
" the next day she was a new person			0
it was an amazing experience			0
" helping patients navigate the health care system musicians and other artists are now a fixture at many medical facilities around the country			2
almost half of @entity95 health care institutions surveyed by the @entity96 in 2009 ( the most recent data available ) had arts programs of some sort , including permanent displays of arts , performances in public spaces and bedside activities			1
while the arts may not cure patients , " research has proven that it does assist the patient in terms of getting well , " says @entity105 , an architect and @entity96 board member			1
" it either allows them to relax ( so that ) their treatment is more acceptable or it helps the caregiver in terms of better reaching the patient			0
" the @entity5 program may well be one of the oldest university - based arts programs , says @entity3			1
and it has grown by leaps and bounds since its inception			0
in its inaugural nine - month cycle in 2002 -- the program is active only during the school year -- it served more than 2,000 people including patients , family members and staff with a budget of $ 10,000			1
at that point , the program consisted primarily of concerts and " roving rejuvenators " -- artists and massage professionals tending to hospital staff and patients			1
in 2012 - 2013 , the budget was about $ 140,000 , @entity3 says , and the program served about 34,000 people			1
by this time , the program included more arts services for patients , family members and hospital staffers			1
it also has several community outreach projects , an international collaboration with @entity152 and research and educational arms			0
growth has been consistent , but not always smooth			0
three years ago , in remodeling a room , the hospital inadvertently removed the closets that had been used by arts - in - medicine to store musical instruments and other supplies			1
the hospital eventually gave arts - in - medicine another room , but then took that away			1
now , @entity15 and her staff have their own small office , furnished with a massage table , an old upright piano and assorted other musical instruments , some of which @entity15 designed herself , as well as tidy sections of colored pencils and @entity174 how hope can help you heal @entity3 came to the field after becoming severely ill while visiting @entity178			0
" i was afraid and lonely and frustrated , " she says			0
" i distinctly remember feeling like i was tapped on the shoulder by death			2
" she decided the only way she could deal with it was to create collages , images , short and simple " sound " pieces , poetry and narratives			0
" the daily art - making kept my life full of meaning , " says @entity3 , who has a doctorate in music composition			1
" and i found myself calm and pain - free until i could get further medical care in my home country of @entity194			2
" she turned the art she made while recovering into a performance piece			2
that led to palliative - care courses , then a collaboration with a hospice in @entity1 and eventually a teaching gig -- @entity15 is associate professor of music at @entity5 -- and the arts program			1
dr. @entity205 , a @entity5 assistant professor of family and community medicine , says he has seen wide - ranging benefits in patients who have participated in the arts program			1
" i 've seen definite symptom improvement , " says @entity205 , including reductions in pain and even reductions in the amount of pain medicine required , nausea and anxiety in people who are exposed to the arts while in the hospital			1
he has also seen depressed patients respond to the arts , even when they do n't respond to other people			1
music can calm dying people who are agitated or in delirium and help with obtaining peace and quiet at the end of life , @entity205 says			1
for @entity232 , 60 , art has become a way to deal with depression and simply pass the time while enduring four - hour chemotherapy sessions			1
a new kind of children 's hospital @entity232 has colon cancer , which has spread to his liver and possibly his chest and spinal cord as well			2
in the past year , he has undergone four surgeries to remove part of his large intestine and one - third of his liver			2
he has spent countless hours in the chemo suite with little to do but read , doze or gaze out the window			0
" there 's nothing you can do but sit there really , " says @entity232 , a general contractor in @entity249 , @entity1			1
when artist @entity254 showed up with a cart full of art supplies one day , he thought , " what the heck , i 'll try my hand at this			2
" @entity232 , his wife and sister - in - law sat around a table and painted and drew			2
@entity232 now has about 15 art cards he made that he sends as greeting - card notes to various people -- including the head of the @entity268 , who displays it on her desk			1
" the art helped me pass the time away and gave me something to do creatively that i was n't doing because i was pretty depressed , " @entity232 says			0
" i did n't have the energy to do much physical work ( but ) ... i was able to sit at a table and be creative and not exhaust myself			0
" the experience also spurred him to take on creative endeavors in his own life			2
" the neatest thing about it was i went home and started doing artwork , " says @entity232 , who is back at work although still undergoing chemotherapy			0
" it was a great , great inspiration			0
" he 's not the only one inspired			0
musician @entity287 recalls standing by an elevator with a cancer patient who had just listened to him play the harp			0
" i almost forgot why we were here , " she told him			0
talking to someone with a chronic illness			0
