" our support will be intense , sustained , " and will be effective if @entity3 leaders unite to face the militant threat , he said			1
with @entity12 's @entity28 - led government losing more ground to @entity23 , @entity0 implored the leader to rise above " sectarian motivations " to become more inclusive and make the government more representative of @entity3 's population			1

@entity42 " called on the countries of the world , especially countries in the region , to take it seriously , " the statement said			0
but outside the rooms of high - level talks , parts of @entity3 are falling by the day			2
here 's the latest on the crisis that is spilling far beyond @entity3 's borders : where is @entity3 's military ? the @entity1 believes " multiple @entity3 military divisions " outside @entity7 have dissolved and are plagued by problems in morale , leadership , training and equipment , according to a senior @entity1 defense official			1
" the readiness outside of @entity7 is certainly in question as they have ceded multiple towns			0
forces in @entity7 seems to be holding today , " the official said			2
the @entity1 believes there are around 10,000 fighters who are either affiliated with @entity23 or members of the group , the official said , and while they are stretched thin over vast territory , they are getting support in the @entity5 areas they increasingly control			1
@entity0 said monday in @entity7 that president @entity84 has prepared " a range of options for @entity3 , " including enhanced intelligence , joint operations centers , military advisers and " steady supplies of munitions			1
" but the @entity1 is being more careful about sending additional weapons and ammunition to @entity3 , because of a lack of confidence in the @entity3 troops , the defense official said			1
@entity23 captures more ground militant fighters believed to be @entity23 have seized the @entity102 oil refinery , the largest in @entity3 , three @entity3 security sources told @entity103 monday			1
earlier in the day , an @entity3 military spokesman had said that an attack was under way , but had been repelled by security forces			1
@entity103 can not independently confirm either claim			0
the @entity102 refinery is a key strategic resource because it refines much of the fuel needed for internal consumption			1
there are already long lines at many gas stations across the country			0
@entity23 militants also advanced toward @entity7 over the weekend from the north and the west			0
at least 70 % of @entity123 province is now under the control of @entity23 , two security officials in the region told @entity103			0

@entity23 captured the city along the @entity22 border saturday , and the militants now enjoy a stronghold and a number of other towns in @entity123 province			0
the fighters have a direct line to the western outskirts of @entity7 , where tension simmers just beneath the surface			0

the convoy was traveling from @entity186 , a predominately @entity28 city south of @entity7 , to another prison north of the city			0

women must wear the niqab , or full veil , in public			0

the military made a " strategic withdrawal " in some areas , @entity194 , the military spokesman , told reporters			0
he said the withdrawals were part of a campaign to " open all these fronts so we can strengthen our positions			0
" but @entity194 did not detail the specific locations			0
two security officials told @entity103 that @entity3 forces have withdrawn from @entity245 , 168 miles ( about 270 kilometers ) northwest of @entity7			2
but even if some withdrawals were strategic , it 's unclear when or how @entity3 forces could retake areas now in the hands of well - armed @entity23 fighters			1
the military said it has fought back against militants with airstrikes			0
officials showed reporters footage of airstrikes they said took place in @entity132			0

they will not be deployed all at once			0
the @entity1 has reached an agreement with the @entity3 government over legal protection for those advisers , @entity280 spokesman rear adm. @entity279 said monday			1
" we believe these protections are adequate to the short - term assessment and advisory mission our troops will be performing in @entity3			1
with this agreement , we will be able to start establishing the first few assessment teams , " he said			0
in addition , some @entity1 military personnel already at the @entity293 in @entity7 will be reassigned and become advisers			1
the first military advisers will focus on assessing the strengths and weaknesses of @entity3 security forces , @entity1 officials said			1
the advisers will also assess what @entity3 military equipment and weapons may now be in the hands of @entity23 , and try to get better intelligence on @entity23 strategy , weapons , and movements of its fighters			1
but @entity84 said there 's only so much the @entity1 can do			2
" part of the task now is to see whether @entity3 leaders are prepared to rise above sectarian motivations , come together , compromise , " the president told @entity103 's @entity311			1
" if they ca n't , there 's not going to be a military solution to this problem			2
there 's no amount of @entity1 firepower that 's going to be able to hold the country together , and i 've made that very clear to mr. @entity12 and all the other leadership inside of @entity3			1
