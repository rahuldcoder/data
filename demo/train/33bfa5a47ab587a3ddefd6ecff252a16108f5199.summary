@entity1 -- " swatting " pranks have sent police rushing with guns drawn to a growing a-list of celebrity homes in recent weeks , but new tactics , technology and a proposed law could bring the dangerous hoaxes to an end			1
@entity14 's @entity13 home was the latest target monday afternoon			2
a 911 caller told a @entity18 emergency dispatcher that a man with a gun was in the house			2
" a number of officers from the @entity27 " were sent to @entity14 's address , @entity18 detective @entity23 said			0
to get to @entity14 's home high above @entity30 , police cruisers sped up the narrow , winding street past the homes of @entity33 , @entity34 and many other celebrities			2
officers must approach the scene with guns drawn , not knowing what is happening inside the house and expecting the worst			0
" it 's a very high - risk response , " @entity41 's spokesman @entity40 said			1
" the problem with crying wolf is that sometimes it 's not false , so we always have to respond accordingly but cautiously			0
" among the @entity18 , the @entity48 and other local agencies in the @entity1 area , it has happened about a dozen times in recent months			0
the actors and musicians targeted would make an impressive red carpet : @entity55 , @entity56 , @entity57 , @entity58 , the @entity59 and @entity60			1
a 12 - year - old boy was sentenced to two years in juvenile detention after he admitted last month that he made fake emergency calls that sent police to @entity65 and @entity67 's homes last october			1
" the comments of the call advised that there were individuals inside the location with guns and explosives , and that several people had been shot , " a police statement said			0
boy admits ' swatting ' @entity65 , @entity67 dozens of emergency personnel rushed to @entity65 's home on october 3 , 2012 , only to find workers inside and no emergency , police said			1
@entity65 , who was on the set of his tv sitcom " @entity87 , " also rushed to his home			0
catching swatters who spoof a telephone number so that an emergency dispatcher thinks a call originated from a celebrity 's home will get easier as technology and tactics improve , @entity40 said			0
these prank calls earned the nickname " swatting " because law enforcement agencies sometimes would send @entity101 teams to respond to the false emergencies			1
law enforcement agencies are " making advances each day " in their ability to track the calls to their origin , he said			2
along with new technology , investigators have analyzed the calls to learn how to identify them			0
" we 're getting better at knowing what is and what is n't a hoax , " he said			1
when @entity55 's @entity13 home was swatted last week , the dispatcher suspected it was a hoax , so just one police patrol car was initially sent , @entity119			1
" we figured it was a swatting , " @entity120 said " we really low - keyed it compared to how we 've been			0
" @entity18 officers are being trained on " what to be aware of and the possibility these are swatting calls , " @entity120 said			1
" we 're training dispatchers to be able to recognize certain distinct characteristic of these calls and maybe change the way we dispatch them so they do n't draw as high a profile response			2
" the rash of swatting incidents spurred the sheriff and other law enforcement chiefs to push for tougher penalties for those convicted , @entity40 said			1
@entity141 state sen. @entity140 has introduced legislation to require a mandatory 120 days in jail for anyone convicted of swatting , @entity40 said			0
the swatter would also have to repay police for all costs , which would probably be several thousand dollars , he said			0
" this is not a panacea , but a step in the right direction , " the sheriff 's spokesman said			1
@entity140 , whose @entity1 district covers some of the celebrity homes targeted , held a public hearing on his proposal at the @entity159 in @entity160 on tuesday morning .			0

celebrities targeted by fake 911 calls recently would fill a @entity13 red carpet
a proposed law would *increase* penalties for making false emergency calls
police are getting new tools for tracing swatting calls , sheriff 's spokesman says
" we 're getting better at knowing what is and what is n't a hoax , " he says
