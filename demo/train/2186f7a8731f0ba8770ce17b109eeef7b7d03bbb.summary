@entity0 , @entity1 -- word : geese father fireworks mark the groundbreaking for the @entity7 in @entity0 , @entity1 , last week			1
definition : a father who sends his wife and kids abroad to study @entity12 and only flies to see them during winter and summer vacations			1
word : @entity16 definition : a geese father who is rich enough so he can swoop in to see his family any time he wants			2
word : @entity21 definition : a geese father who is too poor to fly			0
he can only yearningly gaze into the direction of his family			0
with a big bang , the groundbreaking for an ambitious new project on the @entity1 island of @entity0 got under way last week , a project that hopes to make these " geese " nouns obsolete			2
the central idea is relatively simple			0
more than us $ 1.3 billion will be poured into creating a city where elementary schools , middle and high schools , and ultimately universities , will be taught almost entirely in @entity12			1
top - notch schools outside of @entity1 are jumping in , one of the first being @entity40 's @entity39			2
and while the location will be in @entity0 , organizers say the curriculum , except for @entity1 language and history , will all be taught in @entity12 and be identical to that being taught at the institute 's headquarters			1
more than 9,000 students are expected to participate			0
officially , @entity12 is taught from the third grade here			1
but many @entity52 believe in an early start			0
there are even popular internet sites that offer recorded @entity12 language songs and stories for the fetus			1
there is also an overwhelming belief that the @entity12 taught in the public school system is not good enough			1
even that the vast number of @entity12 private institutes are not up to par. that leaves many @entity1 parents little choice but to send their children overseas			1
official statistics say that as of 2007 , more than 27,000 @entity1 high , middle and even elementary school students were studying abroad			2
a government survey done last year says nearly half of all @entity1 parents wanted to send their children abroad			1
one such parent was national assemblyman @entity74 , who made one of the opening speeches at the groundbreaking ceremony for the @entity7			0
because he represented a neighborhood in @entity80 , @entity74 could not send his children overseas without seeming to abandon his voter base			1
" i always felt guilty because my children were not getting the @entity12 education that other people were getting because of me			1
" he also saw how the geese father phenomenon was breaking up families , and creating social problems			2
there have been many media reports about divorces , and even suicides among the lonely fathers			0
so when the government of @entity94 asked him to support their project , @entity74 said he gladly said yes			0
@entity0 officials say the tuition will be somewhere between us $ 3,100 to us $ 4,700			2
about half the amount @entity1 parents would be paying to send their children overseas			1
but @entity0 is eying something bigger than just the @entity1 market			2
the future vision is targeting the entire northeast @entity104 population : @entity105 and @entity106 as well as @entity1 children			1
" potentially there are 750 million people that live within a two - hour flight time radius of @entity0 , " says @entity108 , the project manager for the @entity7			0
@entity0 is already a popular destination for @entity105 and @entity106 tourists			0
the tropical climate and natural beauty of the island is a major draw			0
and the island has recently attracted foreign investors who are seeking to cultivate the island 's assets			0
but the project also has some worried			0
the lucrative @entity12 language market in @entity1 has already resulted in a total of 21 " @entity12 villages " across the country			1
and more are popping up			0
next month , an @entity12 village capable of schooling some 5,000 children will open in the southern city of @entity131			1
the concern is that the @entity0 project will become just " one of the many			0
" and that it will be difficult for the provincial government to recoup their investment , especially in this slow global economy			0
but the @entity0 officials are confident that the project will distinguish itself because it encompasses not just schools , but residential and commercial facilities , all using @entity12 language to enhance the immersion experience			1
the first stage -- comprising one each of an elementary , middle and high school -- will be ready to accept students from 2011 , and the entire complex is scheduled to be complete in 2015			0
organizers say that will be more than enough time for the global economy to recover and the demand for quality @entity12 education in @entity158 to flourish			2
that 's good news for all geese fathers in @entity1 .			2

more than $ 1.3 billion will be spent into creating city where @entity12 will be taught
curriculum , except for @entity1 language and history , will be taught in @entity12
many @entity1 parents send children overseas to learn @entity12
