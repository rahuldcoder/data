-- it makes sense that we 're all obsessed with the missing @entity4			1
what i find more mysterious is why we are n't obsessed with other arguably more important stories			1
the missing @entity9 plane falls right at the nexus of several gripping story lines in the public narrative			2
stories about death inherently hold our attention			1
the more dark among us -- and @entity17 producers -- might attribute this to a lust for the gruesome			0
@entity20 would simply call it our " death drive " — that mix of fear and fascination that our lives must ultimately end			1
regardless , as @entity28 noted in @entity29 , media coverage has always hewed toward dark sensationalism to feed the cravings of a hungry audience			0
there 's something about death in sudden , large numbers that grabs our attention			1
every year , about 32,000 people are killed by guns in the @entity39			2
and yet the routine daily suicides and shootings do n't seem to command our attention or even our compassion in quite the same way as mass shootings like @entity46 or @entity47			1
of course , we also respond to whom the victims are : when they are innocent little children , the dismay is more intense			1
it 's not just about numbers — the idea that suddenly a large group of people are harmed			2
while the unknown fate of the 239 souls aboard the @entity61 flight is unquestionably looming with tragedy , on the same day the plane went missing around 20,000 people died from cancer worldwide			1
around 4,000 people worldwide died from @entity66 on the same day			1
in the 11 days since the plane has been missing , more than 1,000 people have likely died from drug overdoses in the @entity39 alone			2
why do n't we care about these tales of death ? or perhaps more important , how could we care more ? the other gripping story line of the missing @entity61 flight is , of course , the mystery			1
it 's a real whodunnit unfolding live before our very eyes			0
adding to the fascination is certainly the fact that , as @entity80 eloquently pointed out in the @entity81 , a genuine mystery would seem impossible in our hyper - connected , over-surveilled day and age			0
@entity80 writes : " the disappearance stands in stark contrast to the hallmark sensation of our time , the certainty that we 're all being constantly tracked and that , for better or worse , we 're strapped to the grid , never out of touch			0
it turns out that 's not true			0
" but if that is really the hallmark norm of our era , then why are n't we equally fixated on the fact that in this day and age , 1 million children are exploited by the global commercial sex trade every single year — many disappearing right out from under the eyes of loved ones or government agencies			0
shocking , right ? but worthy of our 24/7 attention ? apparently not			0
" the problem with our always - on culture is that actually , we 're not always focused on stuff that matters , just stuff that triggers , " says @entity104 , co-founder of the @entity105			0
" the news business has long understood this , but now the rise of social media seems to be making the problem even worse , since it is fragmenting our attention down to the individual level			0
" still it raises the question -- what about the things that arguably matter and on some level trigger , just not enough ? is there a way to make the daily scourge of @entity66 and child sex trafficking and gun violence as gripping as a missing jumbo jet ? no , says @entity127 , a licensed therapist and founder of @entity129			1
@entity130 argues its not just the conflation of compelling plot lines that makes the @entity61 plane story so gripping — it 's the fact that it 's a lot of people , that it happened suddenly , and that we still do n't know what happened			1
what grabs us is the idea that a plane can suddenly , unpredictably drop out of the sky			0
it ruptures our need for control			0
" people want details because they want to know this wo n't happen to them , " @entity130 says			0
@entity130 suggests our fascination with tragedies like the @entity61 plane is less about the basic facts of death or scale or even mystery but simply the egotistical desire to categorically exempt ourselves from whatever new possibility of bad things happening arise out of the story			1
" it 's about ego and self - preservation and wanting some sense of control , " @entity130 says			0
in other words , even though we are more likely to die from cancer ( 1 in 4 odds for men , 1 in 5 odds for women ) than a plane crash ( 1 in 11,000,000 million odds ) , cancer feels like a known , even avoidable threat ( even if it 's not ) whereas the missing plane pushes our personal panic button			1
the media can keep trying to tell the stories of poor people dying from lack of food and shelter , of children in rural communities and inner cities dying from gun violence , of black and @entity188 woman disproportionately being infected with and dying from hiv / aids			0
these stories are vital , especially when told in careful ways that do n't just elicit individual sympathy but illuminate larger structural implications and the need for solutions			1
but no matter how numerous , no matter how gruesome and no matter how pressing , these and other critical stories may never pierce our consciousness , let alone capture world attention			2
then again , @entity130 points out , the @entity61 plane story is only interesting until it ends			2
" once there 's closure ... we 'll go on and forget about it , too , " she says			0
" strange comfort that , in the end , all stories — important or intriguing or in between — fall victim to our short attention span .			2

@entity211 : we 're obsessed with missing @entity61 flight ; why not other tragedies ?
@entity211 : stories about death in huge numbers , mystery and innocent victims fascinate us
@entity211 : cancer , guns , @entity66 , trafficking take many more lives , yet we do n't *pay* attention
she says those stories do n't have the suddenness and do n't push panic buttons
