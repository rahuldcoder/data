-- @entity1 and their city rivals @entity2 both made embarrassing exits from the @entity5 on wednesday			1
@entity1 were beaten 2 - 1 in @entity6 to leave the @entity8 side and @entity9 as the qualifiers from @entity11 , while @entity2 beat @entity12 2 - 0 at the @entity13 but went out as @entity14 won 2 - 0 at @entity15			1
it left @entity12 and the @entity17 to go through from @entity18 to complete a chastening first experience of @entity21 's top club competition for @entity23 's expensively assembled side			2
but it was the exit of last year 's runners - up @entity1 which was the biggest upset , needing only a draw to ensure their passage to the last 16 , goals from @entity25 and @entity26 sent them crashing			1
@entity33 to topple @entity34 in ' @entity36 ' clash ? @entity37 pulled one back in the 89th minute to set up a frantic finale but they could not force the equalizer			0
@entity25 's goal after nine minutes came as a result of defensive uncertainty with goalkeeper @entity44 parrying out a cross which fell invitingly for the scorer			0
@entity47 wasted @entity1 best chance to level and @entity49 belted the ball against his own crossbar in the second half before @entity26 nipped in to head home the crucial second goal in the 84th minute			2
it was the first time @entity57 's men had failed to reach the knockout stages of the @entity5 for six years and only the third time in 16 years			1
" of course we 're disappointed , there 's no other way you can feel , " @entity57 told @entity59			0
" it 's part of football			0
you have to deal with the disappointment , and this club has used it as motivation many times			0
" these young players will feel disappointed tonight but they 'll have to cope with it and go on with their careers			0
" @entity74 scored the crucial goal after seven minutes for @entity9 in their 1 - 0 win over @entity77 which left them top of the group			1
@entity82 leaders @entity2 eased to victory against their understrength @entity85 visitors as @entity86 and @entity87 struck either side of halftime			1
but it all proved academic as @entity14 left @entity15 pointless after goals from @entity92 and @entity93 inflicted a sixth straight group defeat on the @entity95			0
it was the first time @entity14 have qualified for the knockout stages of the @entity5 .			2

@entity2 and @entity1 exit @entity5
@entity1 lose 2 - 1 in @entity6 to seal their fate in @entity11
@entity2 beat @entity12 2 - 0 but @entity14 's win eliminates them
@entity105 and @entity106 only two qualifiers for last 16 from @entity82
