@entity0 , @entity1 -- their stare is blank and unblinking ; they stand rigid and dumb			0
passers - by look on bemused as a child attempts to clamber up one of their backs			0
it 's no harm , they are after all just a pair of concrete cows , painted white with cute little black spots			1
the question is : what do these rock - solid ungulates have to do with the future of architecture ? the answer : more than you imagine			1
i 'm here for the 14th @entity25 , directed on this occasion by @entity27 -- the @entity28 , @entity29 - winning powerhouse who , over 40 years , has built notable structures everywhere from @entity32 to @entity33			1
this , while maintaining a side - line in serious academia , publishing , journalism and , for good measure , a place on @entity39 's list of the world 's 100 most influential people			1
we meet under dappled light in a quiet corner of the @entity47 -- a sloping , lovingly tended park , split by a canal and dotted with " national pavilions " -- miniature exhibition spaces built by each participating country at various intervals since 1893			0
sat in a fresh white shirt without so much as a bead of sweat on his tanned , furrow-less brow , @entity27 appears remarkably calm for a man who 's just spent the last four years managing this colossal undertaking , often referred to as the " @entity62			1
" " what 's unique about the @entity25 is that it 's based around these national pavilions ... so you end up with a global tour of ideas , " he says			1
there are 65 contributing nations this year -- a jump from 55 in 2012 -- including a refreshing dose of non-western first - timers like @entity74 , the @entity75 and @entity76			1
but what are they showing , exactly ? " architecture should be open to everything			1
my whole life has been dedicated to expanding the boundaries of architecture - never considering it a single entity ... events like the @entity25 help to open new possibilities precisely by showing us something other than buildings alone , " explains @entity27 , whose slim , long physique is at odds with the weighty seriousness of his character			1

guarding the entrance to the neoclassic @entity107 pavilion , like quaint , toothless lions , the cows are on loan from @entity110 -- the last of the post-war @entity111 -- where they 've been serving as unofficial mascots since the mid- 70s			0
they 're the opening gambit of an exhibition that includes a poem by @entity118 , a portion of a @entity121 painting and snippets from @entity124 's @entity123 ; much of it infused around electric indigo depictions of the @entity107 's most iconic housing estates			2
for a sentimental @entity129 like me , it 's an exhilarating kaleidoscope of cultural reference points			2
to echo @entity27 , it 's also a bold reminder that architecture is -- or at least should be - about a great deal more than blueprints , digital renderings and scale models			1
" we must accept that it 's part of a broader culture , " says @entity28 architectural historian @entity139 , who co-curated the exhibit alongside @entity107 architect @entity141			2
the pair contend that culture -- from the romantic traditions of the late 19th century , to the sci - fi visions and imagined utopias popular right through the 20th -- has had a significant influence on @entity107 architecture over the last 100 years			2

so what we 've really made is an argument -- an argument that the world is something you can change with a fired - up imagination , " says @entity141 , in what for a moment feels like a rousing call - to - arms			0
like all the national pavilions , the @entity107 exhibit is a response to a specific theme , set by @entity27 , titled " @entity173 , 1914 - 2014			1
" explaining the idea behind this theme , @entity27 argues ( in fact , he tells me it 's more of a " provocation " ) that modern forces -- particularly those of globalism and advancing technology -- have led to a uniform " international " architecture ( glass towers , square blocks and so on ) at the expense of more distinctive , traditional styles worldwide			1
and so it is that as you stroll from pavilion to pavilion , you encounter all manner of colorful explorations riffing on this idea -- mostly characterized , in fact , by each nation 's attempt to show how they are the exception to the rule			2
outside the @entity207 pavilion , for instance , a small plantation of old - fashioned alarm clocks stand like black sunflowers on long , rigid stalks			0
it 's an eerily surreal reference to factory life , the clockwork operations of workers , and a precursor to an exploration of the factory as the distinguishing symbol of modernity in @entity207			1
over in the @entity75 , the floor is smothered in a brilliant bright , multi-colored carpet -- conjuring a sense of the @entity224 nation 's vibrant spirit			2
in contrast , the thrust of the exhibit dwells on the pre-eminence of concrete which , after the catastrophic @entity231 hurricane of 1930 , was obligatory for all new construction			0

the result , claim curators @entity242 , was a distinctive form of modernism -- adapted to the tropical climate with a healthy twist of @entity75 flair			0
inside the @entity251 pavilion there 's a full - size partial replica of the @entity253 ( chancellor 's bungalow ) in @entity255 -- built by architect @entity256 in 1964			2
the @entity257 was ubiquitous in the @entity251 media during the tenure of the @entity251 , and functioned as the " nation 's living room			2
" its airy , forward - looking 60s modernism is worlds apart from the formal grandeur of the pavilion itself , which was built during the era of the @entity268			0
the result is not only a visceral dialogue between two generations of @entity251 architectural history , but a statement about the role of politics in shaping the country 's national style			2
a hop , skip and jump and we 're in the @entity281 pavilion -- where the curators have turned the ornate building into a spoof international trade fair			0
in a playful , tongue - in - cheek turn , 20 fictional companies have set up shop across rows of mock sales stands -- most with a dedicated agent -- offering commercial , distinctly @entity281 - themed solutions to the problems of contemporary architecture			1

" nearby there 's " @entity305 " - a hypothetical merger of all existing @entity281 prefabricated housing suppliers , and " @entity308 " -- a booth selling above - ground bunkers based on @entity281 social housing blocks , designed for post-apocalyptic living			0
" trade fairs are the ultimate symbol of modernity " explains co-curator @entity313 , as he guides me past a series of garish corporate logos			0
" they all look exactly the same -- they operate by the most universal language you can imagine			0
" there 's a great sense of theater here , and underneath is a well - considered comment on both the state of modern architecture and the means by which new ideas are communicated and sold			1
as @entity313 says , " the advantage of using this commercial language to display our exhibit is that it explains complicated things in a very easy way			0
" the @entity281 pavilion is perhaps the most direct response to @entity27 ' theme -- distilling key aspects of the country 's architectural identity into discreet elements			1
by transforming them into commodities , they also show how facets of our past must be repackaged in a commercial framework in order to survive modernity			0
looking back to when he first conceived the idea for this @entity25 , @entity27 says that he was struck by how easy it was , when looking at a series of buildings from a 100 years ago , to identify them by nation			1

" if we are to succeed in finding an antidote to the generic , then looking to our own societies must surely be a critical first step			0
the @entity378 succeeds because it places people -- our history , culture and even our bodies -- at the very heart of its thinking			0
it may not have all the answers , but it 's certainly asking all the right questions .			0
