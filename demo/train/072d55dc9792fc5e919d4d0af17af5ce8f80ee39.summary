@entity27 added that there had been several crashes in the same area			0
when the official luge competition started , male and female racers started from lower points on the luge track , which led to slower speeds			0
@entity18 's report acknowledges concerns about the design of the track			2
" following mr. @entity7 's fatal incident , questions arose regarding athlete safety at the @entity25 track and more specifically , the design of the track and the unprecedented high speeds attained at this venue , such as the record speed of 153.98 km / h [ about 95.68 mph ]			1
" given the high speeds at the track , the @entity54 ( @entity54 ) asked the sliding center for more training days prior to the @entity15 and required athletes to make numerous practice runs from various , lower parts of the course before graduating to the top of the course			2
