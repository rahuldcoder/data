-- there has been a lot of chatter in the media lately about @entity6 's record as secretary of state			1
and aside from what @entity13 says , the right wing 's talking point du jour has been that she did n't have one " signature " accomplishment			0
but that could n't be further from the truth			0
while she achieved a great deal as our nation 's top diplomat , one accomplishment stands out : she restored @entity24 's standing in the world			1
believe me , this was no small feat. think back to 2009 when @entity6 took office : the @entity24 was engaged in two lengthy , expensive , deadly wars ; the previous administration 's unilateral foreign policy had alienated our strongest allies ; our respect around the world was extremely low ; and @entity36 -- the most wanted man in the world -- was still on the run			1
we were n't just in a rut ; we were in what seemed like a bottomless pit			0
and we were in desperate need of a strong leader to dig us out			0
@entity13 criticized for @entity6 ' brain injury ' suggestion that leader was @entity6			0
on @entity47 , @entity6 began the long , arduous task of shedding the black cloud that had hovered over @entity24 foreign policy for nearly a decade			1
she embarked on a world tour with the goal of repairing diplomatic ties with leaders , restoring @entity24 's stature on the global stage , and reinvigorating longstanding friendships			1
@entity6 knew that there was " a lot of damage to repair : " " there 's a great exhalation of breath going on around the world as people express their appreciation for the new direction that 's being set , " she said			1
as @entity75 explained in foreign affairs , " because of her worldwide popularity and tireless travel -- she set a new record for a secretary of state by visiting 112 countries -- @entity6 helped undo the damage that the habitual unilateralism of the @entity79 administration had done to the global image of the @entity24			1
" secretary @entity6 was perfectly clear that this was a top priority : " [ @entity82 ] inherited such a range of problems and deficits across the world that it would be a luxury to say , ' i 'm going to focus on this and this alone			2
' ... my big - picture commitment is to restore @entity24 leadership , and i think that 's about as big a job as you can get			2
and everything i 've done is in furtherance of that			0
" and there is no doubt that she was successful			0
a @entity100 poll found that the opinion of countries all over the world toward the @entity24 has improved dramatically since the tenure of @entity6 's predecessor			1
but restoring @entity24 's standing in the world not only required repairing relationships with global leaders , it required tackling two colossal tasks left behind from the previous administration -- winding down two wars and bringing @entity36 to justice			1
secretary @entity6 took office eight years after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on @entity24 , yet @entity36 -- the mastermind of those attacks and leader of the world 's most infamous terrorist organization -- had still not been found			1
@entity6 supported the raid that finally brought our nation 's greatest enemy to justice			2
secretary @entity6 's work to restore @entity24 's standing in the world paved the way for many of her other major accomplishments and helped bring forward a new era in @entity24 diplomacy			1
@entity6 : no need for new @entity138 committee , but @entity139 ' calls the shots ' in the @entity141 the @entity144 - @entity143 conflict is one of the most deeply rooted , complex issues of global politics			2
dealing with this conflict has been high on the agenda of nearly every secretary of state for decades			0
in november 2012 , @entity6 helped avert an all - out war in @entity151 by negotiating a cease - fire between @entity144 and @entity153			0
after eight days of violence , as @entity159 noted , " secretary of state @entity6 got a @entity151 cease - fire right at the moment hope seemed dead for a rapid end to the violence			2
" in today 's complex world , where we are not always dealing with predictable actors , one of the single most important thing we can do to protect our great nation -- and our allies -- is to ensure that there are fewer nuclear weapons			0
as secretary of state , @entity6 made great strides in countering the proliferation of nuclear weapons around the world			2
she played a pivotal role in the passage and enactment of the @entity177 , which will reduce key nuclear arsenals to their lowest levels in 50 years			0
concerned with @entity180 's expanding nuclear program , secretary @entity6 focused her efforts on building a multinational coalition to impose unprecedented sanctions designed to press @entity180 to comply with its international obligations			1
through aggressive diplomacy she persuaded countries around the world , including the @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , and @entity194 to impose sanctions of their own , multiplying the power of our sanctions and the pressure on @entity180			0
these sanctions decreased @entity180 's oil exports by more than a million barrels a day -- costing @entity180 nearly $ 3 billion a month			0
these are all impressive feats , but @entity6 's accomplishments do n't end there			2
from establishing the first - ever ambassador for @entity207 to breaking new ground on human rights matters like protecting girls from violence , secretary @entity6 consistently worked to promote the work of women in the @entity24 and globally			1
the fact is : @entity6 's record as secretary of state speaks for itself			1
and it speaks loud and clear that she was exactly the kind of skilled leader our country needed			0
