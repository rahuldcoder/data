-- it was on the pages of newspapers and in the coveted aisle seat on television 's " @entity6 " that the world met @entity8 , the passionate lover and sometimes combative critic of film who virtually defined cinema critique for a generation			1
but in his final years , when cancer had robbed him of his jawbone and whittled away his once ample frame , it was social media , particularly @entity20 , that let @entity8 not only keep talking , but also interact with his fans , and foes , more freely and personally than ever			1
" @entity20 for me performs the function of a running conversation , " @entity8 wrote in june 2010 , about eight months after he signed up for the site and five years after losing his vocal chords and part of his lower jaw to thyroid and salivary gland cancer			1
" for someone who can not speak , it allows a way to unload my zingers and one - liners			1
" he wrote that he 'd sworn never to become a " twit " -- that he 'd been sure nothing worthwhile could be communicated in 140 characters			0
but , in its way , the site , with its fast - paced microbursts of info , was perfect for a man who had never shied away from snark , whether arguing with professional foil @entity45 or ripping gashes into " @entity48 " or " the @entity49			2
" " @entity20 is now a part of my daystream , " @entity8 wrote			1
" i check in first thing every morning , and return at least once an hour until bedtime			0
i 'm offline , of course , during movies , and do n't even usually take my @entity56			2
the only tweeting i 've done with mobile devices was when our @entity58 went down one day , and when my laptop was lost in @entity61			0
but you can be sure that before i write the next three paragraphs i will tweet something			0
" if @entity20 was made for @entity8 , @entity8 was , in the end , made for @entity20			1
" @entity8 really understood social media , " said @entity66 , senior tech analyst with @entity67 , a @entity0 content partner			1
" he instinctively ' got it '			0
" remembering @entity8 : tweets pour in forget the need to continue the long - form journalism that won @entity8 a @entity73			1
he had his blog , and his @entity76 column , for that			0
@entity20 was where @entity8 continued talking about movies , politics , life and the universe the same way he 'd once done over mugs of beer at his beloved @entity87 ale houses			1
he had more than 840,000 @entity20 followers			2
but while many @entity20 users with a dose of celebrity use the site as a self - promotional megaphone , for @entity8 it was a two - way radio			1
" the best part about the way @entity8 used @entity20 was that it was n't just a one - way conversation , " @entity95 said			1
" he would debate and argue with his followers			0
that sort of true interaction is really rare for someone of his stature and celebrity			0
... it was a new way to really engage with the community -- and even with new fans -- in a way that was more immediate and more instantaneous			0
" in the hours after his death became public thursday , @entity20 users recalled their interactions with him on the site			1
movie questions he 'd answered			0
direct messages he would send to compliment a tweet he enjoyed			0
even heated debates they 'd engaged in , 140 characters at a time			0
opinion : what the @entity58 owes to @entity8 freed largely from the " old media " standard of public impartiality , @entity8 mixed it up lustily at times on topics ranging from video games to politics			1
he was a harsh critic of vice-presidential candidate @entity132 and the tea party movement , which he decried as a phony cause ginned up by political operatives to manipulate voters			0
it was that back - and - forth that displayed the @entity140 's ugly side			1
from dark , often anonymous perches behind their computer screens , trolls responded to @entity8 's opinions with hateful mockery of his disease and the toll it had taken upon him			2
how many pieces need to fall off @ ebertchicago before he gets the hint to shut the --- - up ? " one blogger tweeted			2
it was part of a nasty string of tweets after @entity8 criticized some @entity155 high - school students who pointedly wore @entity158 flag t - shirts to school on @entity160			1
" you know , @ ebertchicago , i 'm not as expert on flag etiquette as you , " went another			0
" tell me , which do i fly when you die of cancer ? " the man who penned the scripts for the bawdy @entity171 exploitation flicks " beyond the @entity176 " and " @entity177 " could no doubt have gone slur - for - slur with them			2
instead , he responded with the sort of surprising grace that had always accompanied his brusquer moments			0
" @entity181 making fun of my cancer : you want ugly ? " he wrote , using his own tea party shorthand			2
" for that , you have to look at a mind , not a face			0
" the social - media voice he developed was , in a way , a natural evolution for @entity8			1
an early investor in @entity194 , @entity8 took his work to the internet much sooner than many of his traditional - media counterparts , scoring a @entity199 along the way			1
but in a @entity202 talk in 2011 , @entity8 acknowledged that the full impact of technology did n't fully register on him until his cancer fight began			2
" it makes me incredibly fortunate to live at this moment in history ... , " @entity8 said as the words he typed on a @entity207 were broadcast via a text - to - speech app. " we live in the age of the internet , which seems to be creating a form of global consciousness			1
and because of it , i can communicate as well as i ever could			0
" he added , " for me , the @entity58 began as a useful tool and now has become something i rely on for my actual daily existence			0
... i feel as if my blog , my e-mail , @entity20 and @entity223 have given me a substitute for everyday conversation			2
" it served him well to the end			0
@entity8 's final tweet , sent wednesday , was a link to a blog post announcing that he 'd be stepping back from some duties ... taking a " leave of presence , " as he put it			1
the final words of that post ? " thank you for going on this journey with me			2
i 'll see you at the movies			0
