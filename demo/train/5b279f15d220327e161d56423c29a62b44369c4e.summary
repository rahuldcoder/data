-- for several months now , @entity1 have been treated to the spectacle of yet another impeachment trial aired on national television			1
@entity5 , chief justice of the @entity6 is in the dock , accused of illegally amassing cash and real estate as well as of " partiality and subservience " to the previous president , @entity12			1
in a country where politics has always been about scandal and spectacle , it 's showtime once again			1
in the past weeks , prosecutors at the trial have submitted evidence of posh apartments allegedly purchased by the chief justice as well as substantial amounts in his bank accounts			1
these , they said , were n't listed on his financial disclosures and their total value far exceed his legitimate earnings			0
if this sounds like an old script , it 's because it is			0
in 2001 , then president @entity32 was impeached -- and later overthrown in a popular uprising -- for much the same reasons			2
and it all happened on national television			0
cheered on by @entity38 's rambunctious media and chattering classes , coalitions of both reform - minded and opportunistic politicians have since then attempted to restage the triumph by launching impeachment suits against a succession of high officials			2
these high - profile political dramas capture the public 's attention and raise awareness about malfeasance in high places			1
but are they the best way to fight corruption ? is the " @entity57 " of political trials the most effective way of cleansing government ? the current president , @entity59 , seems to think so			1
as a legislator , he had backed @entity32 's impeachment and also the failed impeachment of @entity12 , whose family was hounded by accusations of corruption			0
as president , he vowed to bring @entity12 to trial			1
he has also supported the impeachment of the anti-corruption ombudsman			2
now it 's the chief justice 's turn			1
@entity59 came to office on an anti-corruption platform			1
his election slogan was " daang matuwid " -- the straight path -- and his allies believe that powerful officials who obstruct that path must be forced out			0
in particular , they see the ombudsman and the chief justice , both @entity12 loyalists , as obstacles to the prosecution not only of the former president but of others they want to hold to account			1
but this strategy is not without political costs			2
if the chief justice is not impeached , then @entity59 will have a sworn enemy in the country 's highest court			1
the @entity93 is a powerful institution : it can block the implementation of laws and also obstruct legal action against corrupt officials			2
the long , drawn - out trial has already taken its toll			1
legislation has been stalled as @entity101 focuses on the impeachment			0
and the bizarre , and sometimes comic , twists and turns of the chief justice 's trial has sucked up the public attention and shifted it away from the systemic reforms that are urgently needed			1
meanwhile , largely away from the public gaze , some of @entity59 's @entity110 have been cleaning up			2
the @entity112 recently reported that the secretary of public works had overhauled the bidding procedures for road projects and had cut down the costs of some projects by over 30 %			1
in 2009 , the @entity119 complained about " systemic corruption and bid rigging " in @entity1 public works projects			1
now it seems that under - the - radar reforms are gaining ground ; there are signs that the collusive system that begot the legendary corruption in the country 's road projects is being dismantled			1
tax revenues are also at a record high , thanks to two reform - minded officials who head the @entity137 and the @entity138 , which have traditionally been impregnable fortresses of graft			2
tax collection has risen nearly 30 % , even without new taxes , the largest ever increase in 20 years			0
these developments provide reason for hope			0
they have also largely taken place outside the cockfighting arena of congressional or judicial politics			0
political trials can be cathartic			2
they bring wrongdoers to justice			2
they also provide opportunities for civic education			0
but they have proven to be a riskier and less effective path for anti-corruption reform			1
after all , the ouster of the womanizing and boozing @entity32 -- who built palatial mansions for his mistresses and received briefcases stashed with cash from illegal gambling operators -- paved the way for the rise to the presidency of @entity12 , who now stands charged with rigging her election and squandering public funds so she can stay in office			2
by casting the spotlight on the wrongdoing committed by individuals and focusing on the moral failures of one man or one woman , political trials blind citizens to the terrible truth : corruption is a cancer			0
taking out a nasty tumor will not necessarily bring about a cure			0
will the @entity6 , for example , be transformed into an institution that is above reproach once it is purged of its unsympathetic and fallible chief justice ? nearly 10 years ago , i wrote about how the weakness of check - and - balance mechanisms within the high tribunal and the porousness of the structures and procedures that govern the court allowed illicit approaches to justices			1
i found a network of brokers composed of well - connected individuals who act as intermediaries to some justices and offer to fix cases for a price			0
i do n't know that such porousness has since been plugged or that there will be a radical change if the current chief goes			0
but there will certainly be a court that 's friendlier to the president			0
like cancer , corruption thrives on a system 's vulnerabilities			0
for too long , @entity1 have been complicit in corruption because that was the only way to get contracts and other benefits from government			1
politicians were allowed to dip their snouts in the public trough as long as they granted favors to their constituents			2
@entity59 was elected to office on the hope that he can change all that			0
his government is taking two paths to reform			0
the first is public trials			0
the second is the less trodden , less showy and less glamorous path of changing systems and procedures and depoliticizing the reform process			1
in the end , this path will be the more enduring			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity244			0

the @entity1 is currently *gripped* by public trial of chief justice of @entity6
country has long been used to scandal and spectacle in political sphere
president @entity254 was elected on an anti-corruption platform
changing political and legal system and procedures could be most effective way to reform
