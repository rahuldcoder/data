-- stepping on stage after leading her party to its biggest electoral triumph in decades , @entity2 chancellor @entity1 almost seemed the antithesis of a modern - day politician			1
bouquet in hand and beaming broadly as the adoring crowd chanted " @entity12 , @entity12 , " the 59 year - old looked more flattered than full of herself			0
" this is a super result , " she said			0
" i think we can all be proud			0
" it was n't the royal " we " @entity1 was referring to -- a mistake former @entity18 prime minister and so - called " @entity20 " @entity19 once cringingly made -- but rather some 41.5 % of @entity2 voters			1
so much for those who say plainness precludes power			0
set to become only the third post-war chancellor to win as many terms in office , @entity1 's speech was a modest affair compared with those of other three - term titans like former @entity18 pm @entity32			1
for @entity1 there was no vainglorious fist - thumping			1
no pie - in - the sky promises to move heaven and earth , to mend the economy and conquer child poverty			0

this is " @entity49 " at its best : understated but achieving			0
and it 's a strategy that is refreshing to watch			0
after all , it 's not often that voters favor consistency over charisma , especially during times of economic strain			0
@entity1 's anti-ego approach has made her an unlikely icon of our times			2
comparisons with the " @entity20 " are easy to make for a woman who regularly tops @entity64 's list of the world 's most influential people and -- as the leader of @entity70 's richest nation -- holds huge sway over its finances			1
but @entity1 's modus operandi is different			2
read more : five things to know about @entity1 's leadership and @entity70 she may not care enough , some say , for consensus and compromise			2
despite that , one has the feeling her choices are born from personal conviction rather than point scoring			0
a pastor 's daughter from the country 's former @entity85 , @entity1 comes over as a moralist in the tawdry world of international government and its gargantuan egos -- perhaps unnervingly so			1
she 's like the good student tucked away in the corner , who puts others to shame come exam time			0
such studied benevolence has served the chancellor well at home , where , despite being childless , she is revered for her soft , caring image , and fondly called " @entity100 '' or " mummy " by millions			1
then again , the relationship between mother and child can be one of love and hate , meaning for @entity108 there 's no room for basking in glory , or for complacency			0
read more : will @entity1 practice what she preaches ? relationships between @entity2 and its world partners can be just as fickle			1
and since politics is a world of smoke and mirrors , of illusions and delusions of grandeur , it would be naive to assume @entity1 was n't as much of a political animal as her peers			1
she has made mistakes and has been loath to admit she 's wrong			0
but the upside of @entity1 's subtle strategy is her errors are harder to spot in a government ruling under the radar			2
as elected chancellor of one nation in @entity70 she has extended her mandate way beyond its borders , dictating humiliating terms to @entity2 's bailed out neighbors and shying away from big foreign policy asks on @entity141 and @entity142			1
two terms of @entity1 in charge may have shielded her country from the worst of the eurozone crisis			2
but with a widening gap between rich and poor " @entity12 " has her work cut out to rebalance her country 's economy and raise low wages			0
finding a way to keep @entity2 's factories running in the future without cheap nuclear energy is another question @entity1 will eventually have to answer			1
@entity1 's second term left her nation strong but @entity70 more divided than ever			1
her third term will require her to focus on reforms at home not abroad , much to the relief of the rest of the region			0
but , again , expect @entity2 's first and favorite female leader to go about that quietly			2
regardless of whether you espouse her policies , @entity1 's victory over the weekend is n't just a win for her -- it 's also a victory for substance over style .			1

@entity2 chancellor @entity1 , heading into her third term , is the antithesis of a modern - day politician
she is modest and *unassuming* , and fondly called @entity100 -- or mother -- by the @entity2 public
she is often compared the " @entity20 " @entity19 , but her style is quiet different
but it would be naive to assume @entity1 was n't as much of a political animal as her peers
