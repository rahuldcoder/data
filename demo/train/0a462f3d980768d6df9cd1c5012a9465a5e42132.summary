-- in describing one 's relationship status , @entity1 offers the option : " it 's complicated			0
" this sums up the relationship between @entity9 voters and the political parties			0
on the one hand , @entity11 are overwhelmingly more likely to connect with @entity13 than with @entity14 -- by nearly a 3 - to - 1 margin			1
a new survey released by the @entity17 , a nonprofit @entity18 - based research group , found that 56 % of registered @entity9 voters identified with @entity13 , 19 % identified with @entity14 , and 19 % with @entity20			1
in the survey , more than 6 in 10 @entity11 said they felt close to the @entity13 , while only 3 in 10 said that about the @entity14			1
when hispanics were asked to describe the parties , 48 % of the responses about @entity14 were negative words like " intolerant " or " out of touch , " while just 22 % of the responses about @entity13 were negative			1
in the 20th century , the @entity13 was home to working - class ethnic groups ( @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , etc. ) who saw @entity14 as the party of the rich			1
today , it is the go - to place for @entity36 who feel picked on by the @entity14			1
yet for @entity14 , all is not lost			2
hispanic voters have demonstrated they can think for themselves			0
when choosing candidates , they will often put the person before the party			0
and so they 've been known to throw their support behind @entity14 who take moderate stances on immigration and eschew the @entity14 's tendency to turn the already contentious debate into an ugly culture war where immigrants are often portrayed as inferior to the native - born			1
it worked for president @entity52 and former sen. @entity53 of @entity54 , both of whom took @entity9 outreach seriously and invested the resources to attract @entity9 support			0
other @entity14 who , at various times in their careers , earned substantial @entity11 support -- i.e. , more than 30 % of the vote -- include sen. @entity63 of @entity64 , former @entity64 gov. @entity65 , former @entity67 mayor @entity66 , former @entity69 mayor @entity68 , former @entity71 gov. @entity70 , former @entity73 gov. @entity72 , and , of course , former president @entity75			1
most @entity36 do n't change their political affiliation			1
they 're notoriously brand loyal			0
even when they flirt with a @entity14 candidate , they go home to the @entity13			1
president @entity81 got an impressive 71 % of the @entity11 vote in the 2012 election			2
but even that part of the story is complicated			0
in august , a @entity86 found that -- when one looks at @entity81 's job approval rating -- there is a huge swing , among @entity36 , from one quarter to the next			2
@entity81 's support among @entity36 is a mile wide and an inch deep			1
one thing you hear a lot of in @entity11 circles is that many of these voters , in picking @entity81 over @entity14 challenger @entity99 , chose the " lesser of two evils			1
" in a recent interview with @entity0 's @entity102 , @entity99 said the biggest strategic error of his campaign was " not investing sufficiently , particularly in @entity9 tv and @entity9 outreach to help @entity9 voters understand that ours is the party of opportunity			0
" he also insisted that his message did n't get out			0
" i think my position and the position of our party is not well understood at the @entity9 community , " @entity99 said			0
i think @entity11 understood what @entity99 was selling			2
they just were n't buying			0
be that as it may , now that @entity99 is not in the picture , many @entity36 are not shy about expressing their view that @entity81 has n't been in their corner , and nor are they on his radar			2
latino voters can really shake things up if the @entity14 candidate is smart about pursuing them			2
according to polls , the number of @entity36 who identify themselves as being on the far left is quite small			0
in an august 2012 survey , the @entity131 found that only 30 % of @entity11 consider themselves " liberal " while 63 % chose either " moderate " or " conservative			2
" yet , one area where neither party has been very smart is with regard to the critical issue of immigration			0
one reason that @entity36 are increasingly ambivalent about @entity81 and the @entity13 is that , under this administration , the number of deportations of undocumented immigrants is on track to reach 2 million in 2014			1
meanwhile , many @entity14 remain stubbornly opposed to giving the undocumented an earned pathway to legal status and pander to nativists by stirring up anxiety over the country 's changing demographics			0
it 's true that @entity36 care about other issues more than immigration			0
in fact , the top three issues of concern for @entity11 voters are usually jobs / the economy , education and health care			1
but immigration is also a defining issue , a litmus test that tells them whether they can trust a given candidate or a party to deal with them fairly and honestly when it comes to other issues			0
those issues now include the government shutdown over @entity173			2
although both parties are very clearly at fault , polls show that most of the blame for this debacle is going to republicans			0
a majority of @entity36 support @entity173 , so they 're not going to look fondly on the @entity14 for gumming up the works to protest a program that @entity36 support anyway			1
it 's a little early to tell what the fallout will be but it might be that the shutdown only serves to further tarnish the @entity14 brand in the @entity11 community			1
the @entity14 was already in a hole with @entity11 voters , and it may have just gotten a little deeper			1
still , it 's also entirely possible that @entity36 will wind up doing on the shutdown what they 're doing on the stalemate over immigration reform and spread the blame to both parties			2
no matter how daunting the challenge , @entity14 must n't give up on attracting @entity11 support			1
but they need to change their game plan , holster the intolerance , and start approaching those voters with something that they 're not getting much of from either party : honesty and respect			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity210 .			0

a survey shows that @entity11 connect more with @entity13 than republicans
@entity210 : republicans must n't give up on attracting @entity11 support
he says most @entity36 support @entity173 , so shutdown is a *disservice* to @entity14
@entity210 : if @entity14 candidates pursue @entity11 voters , they can win them over
