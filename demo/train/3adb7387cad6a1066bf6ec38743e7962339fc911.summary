-- @entity2 architect @entity1 only plays the occasional game of poker , but he 's willing to put all his chips on the table and risk at least $ 150,000 on somebody else 's dream			1
that 's the estimated value of in kind contributions that @entity1 , his partners and consultants are donating to build what 's been dubbed the 9th @entity14 -- a community track and athletic field in part of the city hit hardest by @entity19 more than four years ago			1
when it 's all said and done next summer , his firm @entity20 will have given an estimated 500 man - hours toward a $ 2 - million project that 's become a symbol of community recovery			1
" the hurricane was such a transformational experience , " said @entity1 , an architect for 30 years and a lifelong @entity2 resident			2
when @entity19 flooded @entity1 's family home under 8 feet of water , it changed him			1
when he found himself accepting help from friends who ripped out useless drywall , swept out mud and tossed ruined beds through the windows , it changed him			0
" i went through this with my wife and kids in a house that i built and renovated with my own two hands , " he said			0
storm damage forced his firm to take up temporary offices in another city an hour away			2
" when that routine is ripped away from you , you get a different appreciation for what it means in your life			0
you get a better understanding of how important that is to who you are and what you do			0
you ca n't really appreciate that until it 's been taken from you			1
" like many other residents , the pain gave way to a mission			0
@entity63 , a 24 - year - old athletic director at @entity64 in the 9th @entity65 , made his pitch to @entity20 and his partners : help build a new stadium for the neighborhood , and make a powerful statement about @entity2 ' ability to overcome @entity19 by working together as a community			1
" the rebuilding of this broken city is a very emotional thing for me and i 'm very passionate about it , " said @entity1			0
" so it was another way to recover our life and regain what we had prior to the storm			0
" the sports facilities at @entity84 -- once a perennial football powerhouse -- were devastated by @entity19			1
like many of the city 's schools , enrollment plummeted after the storm as residents fled and never returned			2
students now attend classes in eight portable trailers			0
the football team practices in an abandoned lot			0
in late 2008 , @entity63 went to work -- online and in @entity2 executive offices -- rallying support for a new neighborhood track and field facility paid for with thousands of individual and corporate donations of time , services , materials and cash			2
" those of us over 50 often become jaded , " said @entity1			0
" people say you ca n't do this and you ca n't do that -- it 's just so refreshing to have somebody @entity63 's age step up and ask the basic question , ' why the hell not ? ' " " it 's really interesting to see why certain people come to the table , " said @entity63			1
" @entity1 was one of those guys from the get - go who wanted to help out , and he just happened to be an architect			1
he was a guy first and foremost who believed what this could do for the city and he was like , ' oh yeah , and i happen to have an architectural company that we can use to help further this goal			0
' " by the time @entity20 -- a former wrestler at @entity130 -- heard @entity63 's pitch , he was committed			1
both of @entity20 's older brothers were multisport athletes who played football in high school and college			1
" athletics can teach kids discipline , commitment , perseverance , goal - setting , and give kids a social outlet , a sense of belonging and improved self - esteem , " @entity1 said			2
a neighborhood sports facility would only do more to foster these values among 9th @entity65 kids , he said			0
according to @entity63 , @entity20 's community status brought credibility to the project early on			1
at the same time , @entity63 said , @entity1 has completely given himself over to the cause			2
" if you talk to him about the project for 20 or 30 minutes , he 's going to start to cry , " said @entity63 , who came to @entity2 after @entity19 as part of the nonprofit @entity155 program			1
" he 's that type of guy			2
" big gamble but as the clock ticks toward the disaster 's fifth anniversary , it 's apparent @entity20 and his partners have invested in a big gamble			2
although the school expects to kick off its opening football game at the new field on @entity19 's august anniversary , the project remains about $ 700,000 short of its goal			1
and @entity63 insists construction will not begin as planned in march until 100 percent of the funds are raised			1
" we do n't want the project to stall after we break ground , " said @entity63			1
" if we stall , we may lose momentum and the project never finishes			2
" under a worst - case scenario , the hundreds of work hours , countless resources and materials donated by @entity1 's firm could yield zero results unless all $ 2 million of the project 's estimated price tag is raised by @entity188			1
" as far as i 'm concerned , to use a poker analogy , we 're all in , " laughs @entity1			0
" sometimes what it takes is just perseverance and pushing and pushing , even when it gets fatiguing			0
it 's worth the risk			0
we 're gon na make it happen			0
" long before the storm , @entity1 and his partners had established their firm as a highly respected regional player in architecture and design -- jointly renovating and expanding the @entity203 , the @entity204 and the @entity205			0
four years after @entity19 , the business of architecture in @entity2 has taken on a different tone , said @entity1			1
" architects can be a catalyst for change in the community and they can make a difference			0
and i had never thought of architecture in those terms until after the storm			0
" in addition to the @entity217 , other @entity20 projects are directly connected to erasing the results of @entity19 's wrath			1
the firm is part of a joint venture to build a new federal @entity223 hospital to replace one severely damaged in the storm			1
in another high - profile project , partner @entity225 plays a key role in the city 's @entity229 reconstruction planning			1
the storm has been a boon to the local construction and renovation industry , a sharp contrast to the national construction business as a whole , which has been slowed by economic recession			0
@entity20 's grateful for the boom -- in part because it helps the firm offset pro-bono work			1
" in that regard , the @entity217 project has n't hurt us tremendously financially because we do have enough work volume to absorb that cost , " @entity1 said			1
green designs over the summer , plans for the field have solidified , including design components that are environmentally friendly			0
if completed , the @entity217 would be among the greenest facilities of its kind in the nation , said @entity63			0
special drainage will help protect the area around the stadium from storm water runoff , said @entity1			0
@entity19 illustrated all too well that @entity2 is susceptible to flooding			2
actor @entity262 's @entity2 recovery group , make it right , has some experience with drainage issues , @entity1 said , and @entity262 's organization is consulting on the project with partner @entity267			2
stadium plans call for field lights which will be carbon - neutral and operate at half the cost of traditional lights			2
outbuildings on the property will have vegetation on the roofs , helping keep the buildings cooler and reducing energy consumption			0
one especially innovative feature under consideration is a running track surface made from recycled athletic shoes			0
@entity282 , which has donated $ 100,000 toward construction of the field , has developed a synthetic material called @entity286 consisting of ground - up rubber and polyurethane from discarded shoes			2
" it 's a very scary time for our project right now , " said @entity63			1
" we have a lot of money left to raise and our timelines are real			0
" describing the emotional pull that drew @entity20 to make such a total commitment to @entity63 's dream , the architect said , " there 's a deeper meaning that projects take on when you feel like you 're serving a larger purpose			1

architect whose home was flooded by @entity19 works pro-bono to build $ 2 - million high school stadium
" there 's a deeper meaning *...* when you feel like you 're serving a larger purpose , " he says
firm 's $ 150k donation may be *fruitless* if funds are n't raised in time
" it 's a very scary time for our project right now , " says school athletic director
