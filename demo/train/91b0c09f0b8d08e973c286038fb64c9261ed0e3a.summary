actress @entity0 recently told @entity1 that she asked multiple designers to make her a dress two @entity4 seasons ago			2
they all said no. she was disappointed			0
" i do n't understand why if you 're a certain size , designers think your taste level goes down , " she said in the interview			0
but then , frustrated by the lack of options , she took matters in her own hands , working with a designer on her own gowns			0
she will debut an original line of plus - sized clothing next spring			1
body shaming is a part of @entity20 culture , at once abhorrent and everywhere			1
women are shamed for being fat , skinny , tall , short , flat chested , busty , too plain , too sexy			1
but lately , there seems to be a different response , similar to @entity0 's -- frustration followed by acceptance and moving on			0
modern women are saying , sure , looks may matter			1
but they 're not that big of a deal , just one aspect of a complex person who can be described in a number of ways : my size is not all of who i am			0
one way women , particularly celebrity women , have stood up to fat shaming has been to disregard the comments and name calling , refusing to be called " fat " or stating a certain pride in their bodies			1
after designer @entity44 called @entity45 singer @entity43 " a little too fat , " she told @entity46 that she embraced her curves			1
" i 've never wanted to look like models on the cover of magazines , " she said			0
" i represent the majority of women , and i 'm very proud of that			1
" the public is also showing their appreciation			0
when @entity58 , @entity59 , showed off her bikini body , @entity57 responded in praise of her " normal " body			1
and not all women are afraid of the word " fat , " or necessarily proud of how they look			1
that 's ok , too			0
in a recent episode of " @entity68 , " the character @entity69 , played by actress @entity70 , put it this way to the show 's titular character , played by comedian @entity75 : " the meanest thing you can say to a fat girl ? it 's ' you 're not fat			1
' " @entity75 's ' fat girl ' strikes a nerve the line was part of a nearly seven - minute speech about society 's persistent fat shaming and the double standards that make it " adorable " for a man to admit he 's overweight , yet something closer to pathetic for a women to do the same			1
as @entity69 says , " it 's too much for people			0
... they call the suicide hotline on me			0
" being fat , after all , is still viewed as the most horrible , devastating thing a woman could be -- a date with a destiny comprised of a houseful of cats			1
check your ' cat - lady ' preconceptions about childless women as @entity69 tells @entity68 in that episode , being fat " sucks , " but it 's just one thing about her			1
she 's also funny , fun , smart and confident			0
she has a good job			0
she does n't need to call on euphemisms to describe how she looks			0
she 's not " full - figured			2
" she 's not curvy or plus - size			2
it might not be the best thing about her , but it 's also not the worst thing			0
and it might be the most important message women , and men , have heard so far			2
women used to shy away from calling themselves overweight as a way to protest thin culture and rebel against society 's fixation on what women look like and what size jeans they wear			1
but the truth is that the focus on appearance is not going away , least of all for women			2
we live in a time when tabloids routinely question whether female celebrities are pregnant and dissect their bikini bodies			0
and yet a male celebrity can run around on the beach with a bit of a pooch and a girl 15 years his junior and no one talks about how liberated he is for " embracing his flaws " nor about his transformation when , months later , he loses the extra weight			2
female celebrities , though , get covers and four - page features on the topic			2
so instead of ignoring their weight , pretending it does n't exist or does n't matter to them or to anyone else , @entity0 , @entity70 and other modern women are acknowledging and owning it -- then dismissing its significance			1
and that 's even more powerful .			0

recent moments in pop culture show women taking a novel approach toward fat - shaming
