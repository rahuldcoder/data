-- a @entity2 rebel fighter collapses to the ground during a firefight in the city of @entity6			2
shrapnel rips through an artery in his leg , and he is rapidly losing blood			2
medics battle to save his life in an abandoned building that doubles as an emergency operating theater			2
photographer @entity19 's images of the grim scene provide insight into the risky conditions under which medical personnel in conflict zones operate			1
it used to be that a red cross on a vehicle or building meant protection			0
assaults on medical personnel and facilities have become all too common , the @entity30 said wednesday in releasing a new report			1
" violence against health - care facilities and personnel must end			1
it 's a matter of life and death , " said @entity38 , the director - general of the organization			0
" the human cost is staggering : civilians and fighters often die from their injuries simply because they are prevented from receiving timely medical assistance , " @entity38 said			1
read the opinion of @entity30 director - general , @entity38 @entity50 , former surgeon general of the @entity52 armed forces , said in @entity53 a @entity52 hospital on the front lines was able to function even with fighting on the premises			0
" both the @entity57 and the @entity52 respected the neutrality of the area that was actually reserved as the hospital , " he said			1
" and it was on the basis that they did not participate in any military activities at all			0
" but these days , convincing warring parties of the neutrality of medical personnel is a challenge			1
@entity69 of @entity70 ( @entity70 ) said in a place like @entity72 , for instance , medics can only operate if there is no military presence whatsoever			0
" it is the old concept of the gun - free hospital , " @entity69 said			0
" this concept was there for a reason			0
once there ( are ) guns inside a hospital , the hospital is no longer a neutral zone , and it will get attacked by different military forces			1

" the most shocking finding is that people die in large numbers not because they are direct victims of a roadside bomb or a shooting , " said @entity94 , whose research in 16 countries formed the basis of the report			2
" they die because the ambulance does not get there in time , because health - care personnel are prevented from doing their work , because hospitals are themselves targets of attacks or simply because the environment is too dangerous for effective health care to be delivered			1
" medical workers are becoming war 's first casualties , @entity38 said			1
hospitals in @entity118 and @entity119 have been shelled , ambulances in @entity2 , shot at			0
