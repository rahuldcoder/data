and it looked like @entity8 was about to hand @entity3 advantage in the title fight as coach @entity67 's side held @entity4 at bay for the first 70 minutes			1
the match turned on a piece of tactical genius by @entity4 coach @entity72 who brought on @entity74 midfielder @entity73 and pushed @entity10 forward			2
yet after the game @entity72 remained cautious on his side 's title hopes			2
