-- when it comes to on - screen chemistry , " @entity6 " co-stars @entity3 and @entity4 are naturals			1
" we 're great together , " @entity7 , 23 , told @entity0 in a recent interview			1
" we can really kiss			2
" to be sure , the two have had plenty of practice			2
as " @entity6 " characters @entity14 and @entity15 , @entity7 and @entity4 are asked to do some lip - locking on camera in both 2012 's " @entity17 " and its november 22 follow - up , " @entity19			1
" if you 're not familiar with the book trilogy from @entity22 that the movies are based on , know that part of the central plot revolves around @entity26 and @entity15 's relationship -- it 's mostly a survival strategy as the two impoverished @entity31 citizens are sent to fight to the death in the sadistic @entity6 , but there 's also an undercurrent of something more			0
there 's the additional complication of @entity26 ' relationship with childhood friend @entity39 ( @entity40 ) , who 's a likely lover as well			0
so as @entity26 , @entity7 is n't wanting for love scenes			1
yet in her typical casual manner , the @entity43 - winning actress can shrug it off			0
" you just kiss , " she said to @entity0 , admitting , " i 've had a couple bad ones			2
" @entity4 , though , is n't disappointing , although the 21 - year - old actor is n't quite as experienced as his counterpart			1
" i have n't had any bad ones , " @entity4 said , telling @entity7 , " you 're my first real big kiss in a movie			1
" " really ? " @entity7 responded			1
" @entity54 , was i gentle ? " to be frank , " no , " @entity4 replied			1
" it was a little abrasive , if i 'm being honest			2
" " it was very slobbery , " @entity7 agreed			1
that sort of honest , spontaneous exchange is what makes the duo , but especially @entity7 , so in demand			1
just three years ago , @entity7 was best known for an indie film called " @entity63 , " which earned the actress her first @entity43 nomination			1
but then came an onslaught of films that permanently changed the tide , as @entity7 starred in one high - profile project after another : 2011 's " @entity71 " and " x-men : @entity73 , " " @entity17 , " and 2012 's acclaimed " @entity74 , " which earned the young star an @entity43			1
born in @entity76 with two older brothers , @entity7 presents herself with an unguarded irreverence that both @entity80 and the public eat up with spoons			1
even as she transformed into one of the biggest stars in the industry , @entity7 remains grounded and outspoken in her interviews , seemingly unaware of her celebrity status			1
when she won the best actress @entity43 for " @entity74 , " nothing changed on set , @entity4 told @entity0			2
" i do n't even think we had a conversation about it , " @entity7 said			2
" you guys were like , ' congratulations , that 's great			0
' and then it was like , ' @entity99			0
' then we started talking about farts			0
" and yet , as the public face of a franchise that has thus far made $ 691 million worldwide , @entity7 is n't completely oblivious to her new place in the world			1
when the first " @entity6 " movie came out , the actress tried to stop by @entity108 , and was quickly reminded of just how famous she 's become			0
" literally the day the movie was released , i had no idea i was famous yet or that anybody had seen the movie , " she said			0
" i do n't think actually i knew the movie came out that day			0
" @entity108 " had to call the police and i had to go down the cargo elevator and i was crying			0
and i saw my ex-boyfriend there and he 's like , ' how 's your life ? ' and i was like , ' really bad			0
' it was the worst			0
" her popularity began to make her nervous about appearing in public , and she would skirt dinner plans to avoid the inevitable requests for a photograph			0
but she 's learned that one has to face fame the way you would face anything else			0
" sometimes i 'm nice , sometimes i 'm in a bad mood , " @entity7 said			2
" like if i 'm at dinner and i 'm eating and somebody wants me to stand up and take a picture -- that 's actually helped with my anxiety , knowing that i do n't have to say yes and i can say no. ... it is hard because you do n't want to feel rude , but at the same time , i have to defend my life and my mental wellness			0
