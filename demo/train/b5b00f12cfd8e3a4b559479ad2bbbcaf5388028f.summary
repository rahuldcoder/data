-- pollution does n't respect national borders			0
outsourcing manufacturing to @entity7 may have resulted in less pollution in some parts of the @entity10 , but other regions have lesser air quality because of @entity10 - bound @entity7 products , a new study in the journal @entity4 finds			1
" pollution from @entity7 is having an effect in the @entity10 , and we need to recognize how that is affecting both our background ozone levels and also particulates that are reaching the @entity22 , " said study co-author @entity14 , professor of atmospheric science at the @entity15 at @entity15			1
in the western @entity10 , @entity7 pollution related to exports contribute up to 12 % to 24 % of daily sulfate concentrations , the study said			1
because of the @entity10 outsourcing manufacturing to @entity7 , the eastern @entity10 saw a decrease in sulfate pollution , but an increase was seen in the western part of the nation			1
because of pollution from @entity7 , the @entity33 area and other @entity10 regions violate national ozone standards one extra day per year , the study said			1
@entity10 consumer goods such as cellphones and televisions are often produced in @entity7			1
although @entity7 manufacturing is n't causing most of the @entity10 pollution , winds called " westerlies " can send chemicals across the @entity43 in a matter of days			1
valleys and basins in western states can see accumulations of dust , ozone and carbon			0
" we know that the efficiency of industry in @entity7 is not as it is good in the @entity10 , " @entity14 said			1
higher efficiency of @entity10 manufacturing , combined with controls on emissions and outsourcing , have made strides in reducing @entity10 - based emissions			2
opinion : pollution could turn @entity7 's dream into nightmare does that mean that outsourcing manufacturing to @entity7 is bad for @entity10 public health ? the study suggests that for the @entity10 as a whole , there 's a net benefit , because the population density in the eastern @entity10 is higher than in the @entity22			1
but the @entity22 still suffers			2
sulfate concentrations went up by up to 2 % , and ozone and carbon monoxide levels saw slight increases too , in the western @entity10 in 2006 , according to the study			2
average sulfate , carbon monoxide and black carbon concentrations went down by 0.3 % to 0.9 % when looking at population - weighted averages			0
but this all comes at a cost : in the western @entity10 and populous @entity7 regions , air quality went down			1
smog forces ' blind landing ' training on @entity7 's pilots black carbon has been linked to asthma as well as diseases such as cancer , emphysema , and heart and lung disease			0
rain does n't easily clear it from the atmosphere , so it hangs around and travels far			0
researchers found that 36 % of anthropogenic sulfur dioxide , 27 % of nitrogen oxides , 22 % of carbon monoxide and 17 % of black carbon from @entity7 emissions were linked to producing goods for export			0
about 21 % of export - related emissions from @entity7 , for each of these pollutants , came from exports that went from @entity7 to the @entity10			1
production of goods for export has rapidly expanded in @entity7 , with volume growing 390 % between 2000 and 2007 , although there has not been as much growth since the global financial crisis			0
@entity7 has generally become a " large net exporter of energy - intensive industrial products , " the study said			2
behind this economic growth is a rise in combustion of fossil fuels , particularly coal , a big culprit in carbon dioxide emissions rising worldwide			0
previous research has shown the substantial carbon dioxide emissions that result from @entity7 trade , but this study focused on more other air pollutants			2
researchers constructed a model using data on economics and emissions			0
@entity138 climate change report points blame at humans over the last decade , @entity7 has seen a huge increase in the use of coal - burning power plants , @entity14 said			1
coal use for generating electricity is a big part of why carbon dioxide emissions have nearly doubled their rate of growth worldwide , according to a leaked report from the @entity138 @entity150 , obtained by @entity0			0
high carbon dioxide atmospheric concentrations are projected to cause a 2 degrees @entity154 ( 3.6 degrees @entity153 ) increase in temperature by 2100			0
agriculture , forestry , ecosystems and human health are all expected to suffer as a result of trends in climate change			0
to decrease pollution from @entity7 , @entity14 recommended increasing the efficiency of manufacturing processes and re-examining energy production			2
scrubbers can reduce emissions from coal - burning power plants			1
" consideration of international cooperation to reduce trans - boundary transport of air pollution must confront the question of who is responsible for emissions in one country during production of goods to support consumption in another , " study authors wrote			0

study : @entity22 air quality suffers because of @entity7 exports
manufacturing practices in @entity7 are not as efficient as in the @entity10
coal - burning power plants have become more common in @entity7
