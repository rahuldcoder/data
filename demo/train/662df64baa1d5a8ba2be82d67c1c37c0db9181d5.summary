-- @entity1 can legitimately claim to have invented ice hockey , and even won gold at the @entity4 -- but its modern - day heroes are struggling to uphold that heritage in the face of adversity			1
when some @entity10 solders first ventured on to the ice in @entity12 , @entity13 in the mid- 19th century to play a modified version of field hockey , they could never have dreamed a multibillion - dollar business would be the legacy			1
however , while the sport has flourished in @entity20 and other @entity22 nations , in the @entity10 it battles a chronic lack of funding and fights for snippets of media coverage in a country where football dominates the back pages			1
@entity31 has not played in the @entity32 since 1948 , and suffered another heartbreaking failure last week in the final round of qualifying in @entity36			1
despite the setbacks , stalwart player @entity37 remains optimistic for the future of the sport			1
" @entity1 is n't renowned for its ice hockey talent , but it 's growing and we 've made a great account for ourselves over the last four or five years , " @entity37 told @entity0 's human to @entity42			1
" so , i think gradually we are getting more respect but with that comes expectation			0
" a squad coached by @entity51 @entity50 , who briefly played alongside @entity52 in the @entity53 , lost to 11th - ranked hosts @entity55 , @entity56 and @entity57 , ending their hopes of going to @entity59 in 2014			0
" we gave a decent account of ourselves , but it would have been nice to have been able to get together as a team for more than just two days to properly prepare , " said @entity37			1
@entity62 , general secretary of @entity63 , which now boasts over 10,000 registered players , is dismayed they receive no funding from the @entity10 sports authorities			0
" extra backing would create more revenue to enable all our teams from junior to senior level to have four international breaks per year to prepare for world championships , to bring on board a sports psychologist , team nutritionist , better preparation , " he told @entity0			1
@entity37 could have followed @entity50 over the @entity79 to try his hand in the toughest league of all , but decided to stay home after becoming a father at the age of 18			1
he also had trials for his local professional football club @entity87 , but chose hockey			2
star player if he has any regret at missing out on the possible riches in the @entity53 , or even the @entity93 , the 31 - year - old does not show it			0
he has forged a reputation as one of the star players in the @entity10 domestic league , being the all - time top scorer , and has helped @entity99 to a @entity101 and @entity102 double the past two seasons			0
matches are played in purpose - built arenas , with the capital cities of @entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108 hosting the @entity109 , @entity110 and @entity111 before audiences of between 5,000 to 8,000 partisan fans			0
@entity114 had a team , for which @entity37 briefly played , run by the @entity116 -- one of the world 's largest sporting owners and investors			1
the @entity121 were wound up in 2003 after only five years when the competition they played in folded and their home stadium was sold			2
the @entity53 hosted two fixtures between the @entity127 and the @entity128 at @entity114 's @entity129 in 2007 , but @entity56 bemoans the fact the @entity132 capital is not represented in the @entity31 professional league			1
" i think having the @entity53 play here is great for the fans and also does encourage people to find out where their nearest ice rink is either to go and watch a game or for the youngsters to start playing , " he said			2
" but one big issue that we have is that we do not have a professional team playing in @entity114			2
we used to have the @entity121 but they finished a few years ago now			2
" but @entity37 is encouraged by the rise of homegrown talent in a @entity31 team which used to be packed with dual nationality players , often of @entity13 and @entity149 heritage			1
so can a @entity31 team make it to a future @entity152 and take a short step towards emulating the 1936 heroes ? " without a doubt , " he said			1
" but if we do n't start now we are going to miss the opportunity			0
" it 's a case of getting that talent to play to the best of their abilities			0
@entity162 , who we have beaten , came through the qualifying to make it to @entity59 , and so can we at future games			0
" @entity37 shows no signs of hanging up his sticks , and playing for his country remains the ultimate goal			1
" it 's a massive honor			0
any sport you 're involved in , the pinnacle is to represent your country , " he said			0
that he has been able to survive at the top of the tree for that long is testament to @entity37 's commitment and a fitness program that begins at 7 a.m. each morning			1
he practices on the ice for about two hours , in the gym for an hour and a half followed by about 45 minutes of rehabilitation and stretching			2
" we consume lots and lots of food , way over the recommended daily allowance , " he said			0
" especially for me because i struggle to keep my weight on			0
" physical sport the world over , ice hockey is a tough and physical sport and @entity37 has his tales of woe			1
" broken leg twice , a few knee ligament injuries , concussions			0
a few pucks , sticks in the head but we have good dentists and good doctors on hand			0
" he first picked up a stick at his local rink when only six years of age and , aside from the brief flirtation with football , was dead set on representing @entity1 at ice hockey			1
he progressed through the under 18 and 20 ranks , eventually taking his place in a @entity31 lineup with players he had considered " his idols " when watching as a youngster			2
" when he first broke into the @entity10 squad at the turn of the century his talent was obvious , " said @entity63 's media officer @entity221			0
@entity37 's regular position is as an offensive forward " expected to contribute goals and in assists " and his standout abilities earned him a one - year contract with @entity231 in @entity232 in 2007			2
" he is one of the few @entity10 players to play abroad at the top level , " said @entity221			0
but the lure of home proved too strong and he returned to @entity99 for another successful spell			0
the @entity238 has a heavy schedule , ending in april when @entity37 will again hurriedly form up with the @entity31 team as they bid to erase memories of their @entity55 disappointment			1
" we 've got the world championship which is in @entity246 this year and that will be our next focus ... we 'll give it our all , " he said			0
@entity1 plays in the second tier of competition -- the top pool dominated by the likes of the @entity149 , @entity13 and @entity253 -- but will be bidding to improve its 21st ranking			2
it 's a far cry from the days when a @entity31 team took bronze in the 1924 games in @entity259 , and capped that with gold in @entity261 12 years later			1
the sport 's powerhouses @entity13 and the @entity149 took the silver and bronze , but with the @entity53 going to strength to strength in @entity20 the foundation for their later domination was forged			0
the break - up of the @entity271 also made it tougher for the likes of @entity1 to take a place at the top table , with countries such as @entity55 and the @entity277 forming strong national teams , with many of the players competing in the @entity253 league			2
early roots after those early @entity152 successes , the @entity10 influence at the highest levels faded fast , but it has been a popular spectator sport and in the late 1980s enjoyed a revival with top teams featured on national television			0
sadly , momentum was lost , and the likes of @entity37 have the satisfaction of taking part in a sport with strong regional identity , but without the sponsorship to attract widespread tv coverage			1
he is already looking to the future , and believes that in the junior group he coaches , there are players with potential to do " very big things " in the future			0
maybe one of his charges will find their way to the @entity53 , and if they show the dedication to the cause -- " never leave anything behind on the ice " is his motto -- that @entity37 has displayed over his long career , then his predictions could prove spot on .			1
