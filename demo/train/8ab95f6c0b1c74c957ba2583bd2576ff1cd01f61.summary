proved to be the biggest surprise of sunday night 's @entity10 -- without winning best picture			1
" @entity17 " did win four @entity10 , including the best director prize for @entity13 that probably should have gone to @entity14 ( his movie , " @entity16 , " got the best picture @entity10 everyone expected it to get , along with one for best adapted screenplay and one for best editing			1
) and by the way , here 's a flash for you people who think best picture really means best picture			2
there are , and always have been , two criteria for a movie getting the @entity10 ' top prize and they have little , if anything , to do with whether it 's really the year 's best movie ... or even a very good movie			1
it 's a movie whose success will somehow benefit as many people in the movie industry as possible			2
it 's a movie that somehow reflects @entity6 's best image of itself			1
when both these factors are in play , the movie is unstoppable			0
so it should have been obvious from the beginning that " @entity16 " was going to nab that one , even without its pre-oscar haul of prizes from such trade organizations as the @entity50 guilds			2
its issues of historical accuracy aside ( and conceded from the start by @entity14 and others ) , the movie 's a crisp little nail - biter that easily sells itself to the international marketplace , which remains the final frontier for @entity61 commercial cinema			0
that takes care of criterion @entity64			0
and as for @entity66 -- well , duh ! movie producers are the heroes who help save the lives of helpless @entity61 trapped in revolutionary @entity70			0
what 's more flattering to @entity6 's self - image than that ? ex-iran hostages hope ' @entity16 ' win boosts quest for reparations if not for that , it 's entirely possible that @entity13 's adaptation of @entity82 's mystical adventure would have picked everyone 's pocket sunday night			1
even @entity86 's " @entity85 , " whose focus on how the idealistic - but - pragmatic president battled intransigent legislators over constitutional banishment of slavery , carried enough contemporary resonance to make it an early favorite in the year of @entity96 's re-election			1
but " @entity98 's " bargain - basement metaphysics is like organic fruit salad to the collective @entity6 mindset , irrespective of ideology			1
and the various trades in movie land from the production designers to the boom operators were likely jazzed by " @entity98 's " technological achievements , notably the digitally enhanced bengal tiger that even the movie 's harsher critics believed to have stolen the movie from its human actors			0
the only other ( mildly ) unexpected incident sunday night came with @entity113 's @entity10 for best original screenplay for his cheeky , incendiary antebellum satire , " @entity116			1
" most of the flak @entity113 caught for the movie came from african - americans , who believed he was at best presumptuous and at worst defamatory in playing fast and loose with the history of @entity61 slavery			0
those who stood up to cheer the most emphatically when presenter @entity123 announced @entity113 's name were @entity126 - @entity61 actors in the film , including @entity128 and @entity129			0
as usual , we 'll have to wait another 20 years to see which of these movies endures beyond their varied contemporary controversies			0
oh and by the by -- sunday night 's @entity10 telecast was as embarrassing as it always is , and not even host @entity137 's attempts to cover up the embarrassments by commenting about how embarrassed he was could n't conceal the fact that , yet again , the @entity140 has failed to make its annual pageant appealing to younger audiences without alienating its older patrons			1
it would seem the only way to pull that off would be to play things safe while seeming to be rebellious			0
and @entity6 's usually pretty good at playing pretend games like that -- except when it 's not			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity154 .			0

@entity154 : it 's no surprise @entity6 picked " @entity16 " for best picture @entity10
he says that 's because its plot has @entity6 saving the day , *stoking* industry 's self - image
he says if not for that , " @entity85 " or technologically striking " @entity17 " might have cleaned up
@entity167 : he says @entity10 ca n't make telecast with youth appeal without alienating older *viewers*
