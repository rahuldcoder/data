-- sunday night 's @entity1 seemed much tamer than many of the other awards shows lately , despite having the promise of host rapper @entity5 to @entity6 that " i hope you got that delay button ready ; we 're going to have a lot of fun			1
" but there were a few moments during the evening that had viewers buzzing			1
here are a few : 1 ) @entity16 epitomizes " crossover " we will try not to drop the term " blue - eyed soul " here , but the former ' @entity22 member nabbed not only favorite pop / rock male but also favorite soul / @entity25 male and soul / @entity28 awards			1
before presenting him with the latter award , comedian @entity29 joked that the competition was between @entity16 , the son of the " dad from @entity36 " ( aka ) @entity34 and @entity35			1
" growing up in @entity38 , i can say this is the first time i have ever been racially profiled by a white woman , " @entity16 joked during his acceptance speech			1
2 ) @entity41 pays tribute to @entity43 @entity41 seemed to embody the spirit of @entity47 salsa queen @entity45 , who died in 2003			1
for those who had forgotten that @entity49 first got into the business as a dancer , she reminded fans as she also sang a medley of @entity55 tunes made famous by @entity45			1
add to that the multiple ruffled and fringed costume changes during the number , which also featured a stage full of fellow dancers , and it was a rollicking good time			2
3 ) @entity62 and @entity63 get " @entity61 " if you are n't familiar with the rap opera that is @entity63 's " @entity61 , " we ca n't even begin to describe it to you , so get thee to @entity69			2
the @entity1 performance with @entity62 on their collaboration " @entity72 " was definitely reminiscent of that dramatic saga			2
it appeared to be a play on the reported @entity78 / @entity77 romance as @entity62 played secretary to his " president @entity63 " and stripped down to a spangled bodysuit			2
the pair sang their dialogue before actually launching into the song that they also so memorably performed on " @entity86			2
" it was ... interesting			2
4 ) @entity88 get political accepting the award for favorite rap / hip hop album , @entity89 used the opportunity to speak out against racial profiling			0
" due to the fact that we are in @entity98 tonight accepting this award , i want to acknowledge @entity100 and the hundreds and hundreds of kids who are dying each year due to racial profiling and the violence that follows , " the rapper said via satellite			0
" these are our friends , our neighbors , our peers , our fans , and it 's time that we look out for the youth and fight against racism and the laws that protect it			0
" the pair later rocked the crowd with a rousing performance of " @entity118 " with @entity119			0
5 ) @entity35 's mom presents her with an award @entity122 could n't have been prouder taking to the stage to give her daughter @entity35 the first - ever @entity125			1
" @entity35 , i 'm so proud of you tonight , " @entity122 said			1
" i know the journey in your career has not always been an easy one , but tonight i applaud and admire you			0
" the singer , who performed her hit " diamonds , " seemed awed that she was receiving such an accolade so early in her career			0
" my fans , i love you so much ; you have no idea , " @entity35 said			1
" i ca n't believe at 25 , i am holding an @entity125 ! " 6 ) @entity138 and her crying cat what to even say about this one ? by now , @entity138 is known for her outrageous outfits and controversial performances , so the scant cat - print two - piece outfit she rocked during her rendition of " @entity147 " was n't shocking			1
but the ginger kitten floating through space on the big screen behind her mouthed the words to the song and began crying what appeared to be diamonds was a bit disconcerting			1
oh @entity138 , what does it all mean ? @entity159 mentions should also go to @entity160 and the show 's audience			1
@entity160 brought " special guest " rapper @entity163 along to perform their classic hit " waterfalls			0
" she recently portrayed the late @entity168 in a @entity170 biopic about the girl group and her appearance sunday night left social media speculating whether she would be joining the group to replace @entity168 , who was killed in a 2002 car crash			0
the audience gets a special moments shout - out because they gave everyone a standing ovation			0
at some points , the awards show began to feel like a presidential @entity185 address with so many standing @entity186 there were some actual statues handed out during the show			0
@entity190 set an @entity1 record with her third win for artist of the year			0
she also nabbed country artist female and favorite country album for her best - selling " @entity196			0
" @entity197 was named new artist of the year , and @entity199 won single of the year for their song " @entity203 " featuring rapper @entity202			0
