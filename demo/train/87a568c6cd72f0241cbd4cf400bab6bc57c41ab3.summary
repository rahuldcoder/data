-- dear @entity1 , my 3 - year - old daughter , @entity2 , amazes me every day			0
in all of my travels around the world as a fashion photographer , i 've never seen anything more beautiful than watching her grow up			2
she loves going to school and dreams of becoming a doctor and a ballerina -- there are no limits to what she can become ! as a father , it pains me that not every girl has the same chance as @entity2 to get an education and pursue her dreams			2
today , girls make up more than half of the 140 million children and adolescents who do n't attend school , and in many countries , more than half the girls drop out before they get to the sixth grade			2
instead of getting an education , they are often forced to marry as children and carry the burden of household chores			0
this predicament is devastating for millions of girls who deserve better			2
it 's also devastating for our world because educating girls is one of the most important steps we can take to end poverty			1
when a girl is educated , she is likely to earn more money to support her family , to promote economic growth in her country , and to have a healthier home life			0
the good news is : we can make a difference			0
as part of the @entity57 's @entity56 campaign , i 've had the opportunity to work with young people to stand up for girls ' education			1
@entity62 , a " for girls , by girls " campaign , mobilizes the energy of youth to help raise funds and awareness for @entity57 programs that provide girls in developing countries with life - changing opportunities , like getting an education			0
thanks to the work of the @entity57 , governments , organizations and girls around the world , more girls than ever are in primary school			1
we still have more work to do to get every girl in a classroom , but we are making progress			1
achieving this goal will require all of us to stand up for girls ' rights			0
men and boys need to be part of the solution			1
after all , the positive impact of girls ' education has been shown to transcend generations , benefiting girls , as well as their families , their communities and our world			1
girls can change the future , but we need to give them the chance			0
join the growing movement to advocate for girls ' education			0
