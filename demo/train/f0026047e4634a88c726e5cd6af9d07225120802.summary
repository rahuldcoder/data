-- newly - crowned @entity2 champion @entity1 could prevent @entity3 from replacing @entity4 as the world 's number one golfer			1
the @entity8 rose to fourth in the world on monday after winning his third successive tournament on the @entity11 at @entity12 , and now has the chance to overtake @entity4 , @entity3 and @entity15 @entity14 at the top of the game			1
@entity3 failed to achieve the second - place finish which would have seen him end @entity4 ' 279 - week reign on sunday , but the @entity20 could still top the rankings on october 31 providing the @entity15 does not change his plans and play before then			1
however , @entity1 's decision to enter the @entity24 in @entity25 at the end of this month means the 25 - year - old could yet be the one to take over from the off - form woods			1
victory there would mean august 's winner of the @entity32 becomes just the 12th player to top the rankings since they were introduced in 1986			0
@entity1 is the first player since @entity4 in 2006 to win three tournaments back - to - back , and the first golfer from @entity36 to do so since @entity20 @entity37 in 1998			1
after his latest triumph , @entity1 told reporters he had no idea why he was enjoying such a good run of form			2
" i was never expecting it and i do n't really have an answer for why i am playing so well at the moment , " he said			0
" i 've always played solid golf and my short game has improved big - time the last two years and especially the last few months			0
" the win came less than a week after @entity1 was part of the victorious @entity51 team who beat @entity15 at @entity53 in @entity54 , where he played with @entity3			2
" the way he played with me last week was absolutely amazing			0
he played so solidly , " @entity1 said			2
" his putting was good , chipping -- the entire game was fantastic			0
i really see him as a role model			0
" @entity3 will now take a month - long break from the sport to recover from an ongoing calf injury , which clearly hampered his progress at the home of golf over the weekend			2
it is expected the 37 - year - old will return for the season - ending championship in @entity69 which starts on november 25			0
the only way @entity71 can retain his five - year long stint as world number one is to play another tournament in october , but he is not due to return to action until the @entity79 event in @entity80 on november 4 -- where @entity3 was also scheduled to appear .			1
