-- " there 's no more skeletons in my closet , " @entity0 told @entity1 's @entity5			1
" i live in a haunted house			0
" on wednesday 's " @entity7 , " @entity5 introduced brand as " the man who put the sex , drugs and rock and roll into comedy , " calling the comedian " a lawbreaker , a line - crosser , a madman and a genius			1
" @entity0 , who makes no secret of his shaky past , told @entity5 , " they know i 'm a junkie			1

brand described his pre-sobriety self in detail , saying he was " a scrawny , retched , ne'er do well -- a twig crow man , scorching across the north @entity43 streets , fingerless gloves , outstretched palm , bags of smack in pocket , pipe on the lips			2
" " i used to hang out with pimps and hookers and junkies and crooks , " continued @entity0			1
" but the reality of that life , you know , you can snatch glistening pearls of amusement from it			0
but when that 's your daily life , it 's miserable			2
" @entity5 asked @entity0 if his newfound immense success made him happier			1
" given that i had an early life that was about like sort of stealing to survive , " said @entity0 , " and having to get on the public transport without paying , and sort of petty incidents , and low - life crime sort of stuff , then yes			1
it 's obviously easier to have money than to be dirt poor			0
but i think that to say that money brings happiness is reductive			0
" @entity5 argued that @entity0 getting a @entity77 driver 's license was a step toward the straight and narrow because " wild rockers ca n't drive			1
" @entity0 , who drives a @entity80 , said he takes driving very seriously and tries " to accept that driving is not a medium in which to express your true nature			1

i love the companionship and the friendship and the consistency of someone being there			1

" @entity0 said , " as a man who is married to a person that can often be on another continent , i need to put my marriage first			1
see if we can work out the schedule in there , and then i 'll do it			0
" " @entity34 , " hits theatres friday			2
" obviously , you 're replacing a legend , " said @entity5			0
" i mean , @entity112 made ' @entity34 ' this immortal character			2
did you have any qualms about taking over such a part from one of your comedy heroes ? " " i hold @entity112 in such reverence , " @entity0 said			2
" i have such strong feelings and affection for the original film			0
it just felt like a privilege and an honor			0
" he called the film " a beautiful way of updating a very traditional and archetypal story			1
" @entity0 , a recovering alcoholic who played a womanizing drunk , had an interesting way of preparing for his scenes			1
" i was smelling the bottles of booze to get me into character , ' cause i do n't drink anymore as you know			0
" i would take the bottles of rum , bottles of tequila , just to evoke the memory			0
" he called the experience " a distilled , but positive aspect of alcoholism , " saying it was like being drunk with the exception of " having to wake up with a terrible headache and a stranger			0
" brand said the overall message of the film is that " @entity34 is a billionaire , but he 's unhappy and he is lonely until he finds love			1
" when the subject of the upcoming nuptials of prince @entity154 and @entity155 came up , the two @entity151 discussed the monarchy			0
@entity0 noted he has been " overwhelmed by patriotism " since moving to the @entity158			2
" i have become sort of seduced by it , " continued @entity0			2
" i think those things have contributed to a renewed appreciation for the monarchy ; while i still believe absolutely in equality at my core			0
" @entity5 asked brand what the difference between @entity168 and @entity158 humor is , and whether the comedian tailors his act for @entity158 audiences			0
" i think there 's a very direct corollary that 's based around our language , " @entity0 said			1
" and i , i certainly do n't think it holds true that the @entity158 sense of humor is in any way unsophisticated when you think of the geniuses like ( @entity183 ) @entity182 and ( @entity185 ) @entity184			0
" as for upcoming plans , @entity0 told @entity5 he wishes " to continue being a stand - up comedian , continue to be happy in my marriage and to make sure that when i interact with people , i make them happier			1
