-- fans of " @entity2 , " take notice : a group of students at the @entity6 in @entity7 have created two masks that can give you superhuman sight and hearing			1
the first prototype covers the wearer 's ears , mouth and nose and uses a directional microphone to give him the ability to hear an isolated sound in a noisy environment			1
for example , you could target a person in a crowd and clearly hear his words without the surrounding noise			0
the other prototype is worn over one 's eyes			1
a camera captures video and sends it to a computer , which can apply a set of effects to it in real - time and send it back to the wearer			1
one can , for example , use it to see movement patterns , similar to the effects of long - exposure photography			2
watch : wearable tech tracks your life the team behind project @entity51 â € ” @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 â € ” see many possible applications of this technology			0
for example , one could use the visual mask it to analyze movement and technique in sports			2
in another example , concert - goers could use the hearing mask to focus on a certain performer at a concert			1
" we are used to controlling the world around us to find the settings that suit us best			0
but while technology advances to aid this , our physical bodies remain the same			0
what if we had the same control over our senses ? if we could adjust them in real time , what experiences would this make possible , ' they ask			1
read more : digital tattoos , mind reading headphones though the @entity51 prototypes are relatively simple , the ideas behind the project are interesting			0
with wearable tech being the talk of the town as of late , one has to wonder if @entity88 , for example , could be paired with visual or auditory augmentation technology to " improve " your senses			2
what superhuman abilities would you like to gain from wearable tech ? share your ideas in the comments			0

students at the @entity6 have created masks that can give *enhanced* sight and hearing
first mask uses a microphone to isolate a *specific* sound in a noisy environment
the other , worn over the eyes , can apply visual effects seen by the wearer in real time
