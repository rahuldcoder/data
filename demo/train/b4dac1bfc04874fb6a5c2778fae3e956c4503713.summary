six months after she was freed from the " house of horrors " where @entity0 held her captive for 11 years , @entity1 kidnapping victim @entity0 is speaking out			1
in an exclusive interview with dr. @entity6 scheduled to air tuesday and wednesday , @entity0 describes a moment when @entity9 trapped her in a room and tied her up with an orange extension cord			1
" i was tied up like a fish , " she said , " an ornament on the wall			1
" an excerpt released by the " @entity17 " syndicated talk show monday shows @entity0 sitting cross-legged on a couch and drawing a u-shape in the air with one finger as she describes how @entity9 hung her by her feet , neck and arms			1
@entity0 also says @entity9 taped her mouth shut with duct tape , according to another excerpt posted on the show 's @entity30 channel			1
and she tells @entity6 she once picked a lock to try to escape , drawing an ominous warning from @entity9 : " now you 're gon na be punished			2
" @entity0 , @entity0 and @entity0 were freed from @entity9 's @entity1 home in may , drawing national attention to the horrific case			1
the dramatic rescue came after neighbors heard @entity41 's cries and broke down a door			0
" it 's astounding to me that she had the strength that she did , " @entity6 told " @entity46 360			0
" " she says that she was referred to as the unbreakable one			0
she fought him every step of the way			0
" @entity6 said @entity0 was chained around the neck and waist with a motorcycle helmet on her head			2
she was left there for days at a time , @entity54 said , adding that @entity0 told him she could n't lie down because the chain was too short			2
so she would just lean and wait until she passed out from fatigue			0
@entity0 told @entity6 , though , that she did n't always fight back , at least not at first			2
she said she was in shock after being taken and all she could do was cry and beg him to let her go back to her son			0
he threw money at her			0
" he was obsessed with prostitutes and also he thought i was a 13 - year - old prostitute , " she said in the interview			1
" when he found out my real age he got mad			0
" @entity0 , 32 , was 21 years old when she was reported missing in 2002			2
in august , @entity9 was sentenced to life in prison plus 1,000 years after he pleaded guilty to 937 counts , including murder and kidnapping			1
he committed suicide in his prison cell in september			1
before the women 's rescue , @entity0 's disappearance generated less publicity and attention than the kidnappings of @entity41 and @entity79 , and a level of mystery still surrounds her case			2
but since their rescue , @entity0 has n't shied away from speaking out			2
" after 11 years , i am finally being heard , and it 's liberating , " she said in a powerful statement at @entity9 's sentencing describing the abuse she endured			2
" you took 11 years of my life away , and i have got it back			0
i spent 11 years in hell , and now your hell is just beginning , " she told @entity9			0
" i will overcome all this that happened , but you will face hell for eternity			0
" when crews demolished the 1,400 - square - foot house where @entity9 held them captive , @entity0 was there , handing out yellow balloons to onlookers			1
she said she was at the demolition site in part to remind relatives of abducted children that all is not necessarily lost			0
" i want the people out there to know -- including the mothers -- that they can have strength , they can have hope , and their child will come back , " she said			0
since their release , accounts have depicted @entity0 as someone who cared for the other victims during their captivity while also enduring great suffering herself			0
a family friend of one of the victims said this year that @entity9 used @entity0 as his main " punching bag			1
" the friend said @entity9 hit @entity0 with a variety of objects , including hand weights			1
she has suffered vision loss , joint and muscle damage , and other problems from her time in captivity			0
according to an initial incident report obtained by @entity132 , @entity0 said she became pregnant at least five times while in @entity9 's home			1
when that happened , she told investigators , @entity9 " starved her for at least two weeks , then he repeatedly punched her in the stomach until she miscarried			0
" @entity0 said @entity9 ordered her to deliver @entity41 's child , according to a police source familiar with the investigation			1
" what 's most incredible here is that this girl who knows nothing about childbirth was able to deliver a baby that is now a healthy 6 - year - old , " a police source said .			1
