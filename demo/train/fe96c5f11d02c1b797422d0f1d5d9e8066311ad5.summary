@entity0 -- a @entity3 government report monday heaped fresh criticism on the operator of the nuclear power plant where a disastrous accident was set off last year by the devastating earthquake and tsunami that hit the country			1
the measures taken by @entity12 ( @entity12 ) , the plant operator , and the @entity3 nuclear regulator to prepare for disasters were " insufficient , " the report by a government - formed panel of investigators said , and the response to the crisis was " inadequate			1
" the crippled @entity23 plant spewed radiation and displaced tens of thousands of residents from the surrounding area in the worst nuclear accident since the @entity28 in @entity29			2
even now , more than one year after the disaster began , @entity12 does not seem aggressive enough in examining the causes of the accident at the plant to prevent a recurrence , the 10 - member panel , led by @entity37 engineering professor @entity36 , said in the report monday			1
the report , the fourth and final one on the nuclear disaster , comes amid growing anti-nuclear protests in @entity3			1
it said interference by the prime minister at the time , @entity45 , created confusion in the response to the crisis			0
it recommended that all nuclear operators in the country conduct a comprehensive risk analysis of their facilities			0
the results of the investigation monday follow a damning parliamentary report earlier this month that said the crisis was a " man - made disaster " resulting from collusion between @entity12 , regulators and the government			1
that report said the disaster should have been predicted and prepared for			2
video : what caused the @entity23 disaster a february report by independent scholars and journalists also concluded the plant operator could and should have done more			1
only @entity12 's own internal report in may said no one could have predicted the scale of the earthquake or the devastating tsunami that followed			0
however , it did admit it was not fully prepared and acknowledged criticism it took too long to disclose information			0
@entity12 also found itself under further scrutiny over the weekend when the @entity3 @entity80 , @entity81 and @entity82 said it was investigating a report that subcontracted workers at the damaged @entity23 nuclear plant were told to use lead covers in order to hide unsafe radiation levels			1
as the official investigations into the causes of the disaster at the power plant conclude , attention is shifting to what comes next for the nuclear power industry in @entity3			1
video : @entity3 ends nuclear freeze the government has been holding public hearings around the country to try to gauge public opinion regarding three options it has put forward for a medium - term energy plan			1
it is expected to decide next month whether to reduce the country 's nuclear power to zero as soon as possible , aim for a 15 % nuclear role by 2030 or a 20 - 25 % share by the same date			1
whichever is chosen , it will be a far cry from the energy policy in 2010 , which aimed to raise nuclear power 's role to account for more than half of electricity needs by 2030			2
the anti-nuclear movement is very clear about which option it wants : the grassroots opposition says @entity3 must become nuclear - free and the number of people making this call is growing			2
tens of thousands are gathering outside the prime minister 's residence every friday			0
last friday was the seventh protest that @entity129 has attended			0
" what impresses me most is ... people never gave up and the crowd is getting bigger and bigger , " she said			0
" even on a bad rainy day like today , we see this many people gathered , it 's amazing			0
" video : nuclear disaster spreads to houses , food prime minister @entity141 hears the voices , but so far he is not being swayed by them			0
he authorized the re-activation of two nuclear power plants earlier this month , claiming that without nuclear power , the country and the economy will suffer			2
" @entity3 society will not be able to function if there is a decision to permanently halt nuclear power generation , " @entity141 said last month but one anti-nuclear protester , who gave his name only as @entity155 , said it was not a simple choice between nuclear and blackouts			1
" if there is a power shortage , there are alternatives , " he said			0
" what about coal - fired power stations , hydro - electric power stations , or we can just survive with what we have			0
we have to be patient , but even with blackouts , we can survive without nuclear power			2
" @entity1 's @entity171 contributed to this report .			0
