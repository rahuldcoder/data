-- the soaring popularity of smartphones and tablets is eroding the distinction between our business and personal worlds , says the head of @entity10 telecoms giant @entity9			1
@entity11 , @entity9 's chief executive officer , told @entity12 the " consumerization " of business -- the trend for personal consumer devices such as smartphones and tablet computers to be used in the workplace -- was redefining the way we do business			1
" one of the things that we are seeing is the barrier between business and consumer is beginning to come down , " he said			2
" what was assumed in the past was very much [ that ] your business life is over here and your personal life is over there -- that is not true , certainly not true for most of your business people			1
" the consumer sector was now taking the lead when it came to innovations in communication technology , giving workers the opportunity stay connected on their personal device around the clock -- whether in the office , at home or traveling			1
" people are going to become networked all the time , " he said			0
" i think we are just at the beginning of this revolution			0
" while there were clear benefits for businesses to be had from the new reality , it also raised challenges around security			1
" it used to be that the it department would say : ' how can i stop people from using it on our corporate network ? ' " he said			0
" today it is ' how can i help people use it securely on the corporate network ? ' " @entity11 said @entity9 was meeting some of the infrastructure costs required for the new communications environment by focusing on improving its customer service			2
" the reason we start with customer service , apart from the obvious fact that customers like better service , is actually the biggest cost of our business and any telecoms business is the cost of failure			2
" through initiatives such as the company 's " @entity89 " program , it had managed to reduce its cost base by Â £ 3 billion ( $ 4.7 billion ) over three years -- and halved the number of complaints received			0
" take the failures out of the business -- and we have done a lot of that -- and the costs fall out automatically , " he said			0
" that cost transformation has got more to go , and it also frees up money and people to invest in the future of business			0

while businesses can benefit from this , it also raises security challenges
