-- the release of a scathing report on how @entity3 dealt with a sexual predator who for years abused young boys on and off campus is far from the end of the school 's troubles			1
the university is still under scrutiny by the @entity13 and the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) , inquiries that could further tarnish @entity3 's reputation and that of its storied football program			1
the organization that grants the school 's crucial academic accreditation is keeping a watchful eye on the unfurling scandal that centers on university officials ' handling of @entity25 , a former defensive coordinator convicted in june of sexually abusing children over a 15 - year period			1
two former university administrators are awaiting trial for their role in the scandal , and more charges are possible as the state 's attorney general 's office investigates what @entity3 may have known about @entity25 's behavior			1
opinion : after @entity3 report , it 's time to look at @entity40 then there 's the possibility of a rash of costly civil lawsuits after former fbi director @entity47 's finding that @entity3 's most powerful leaders showed " total and consistent disregard " for child sex abuse victims and covered up attacks by the school 's former assistant football coach			1
" the university hired their own executioner when they hired @entity56 , " said @entity0 legal analyst @entity53			1
" they are going to get pounded in civil litigation , " likely for millions of dollars by victims who use @entity47 's report as " a roadmap " in their case			1
though in some ways , @entity53 added , @entity3 should be commended for " hiring an investigator who was so brutally honest " in his review			2
@entity47 's report was so scathing that some say it could be the nadir of the university 's reputation			1
" in the public minds , yesterday was the moment that everyone remembers about @entity3 , the higher ups and @entity75 , " said @entity53			0
" you did n't hear it to that extent in even the @entity25 trial			0
this was likely the biggest moment of adverse publicity the university will endure			1
" @entity47 released the results of the university - funded probe on thursday , reporting that his team of investigators had found that several school officials had " empowered " @entity25 to continue his abuse			1
more storms looming for @entity3 in wake of report legendary head football coach @entity75 also could have stopped the attacks had he done more , @entity47 concluded			0
" our most saddening and sobering finding is the total disregard for the safety and welfare of @entity25 's child victims by the most senior leaders at @entity3 , " @entity47 wrote			1
" the most powerful men at @entity3 failed to take any steps for 14 years to protect the children who @entity25 victimized			0
" he blamed @entity75 , former @entity3 president @entity105 and administrators @entity106 and @entity108 for having " never demonstrated ... any concern for the safety and well - being of @entity25 's victims until after @entity25 's arrest , " while the board of trustees failed to perform its oversight duties			1
that collective failure " to protect against a child sexual predator harming children " lasted " more than a decade " and allowed @entity25 to further harm his victims , the full report says			0
@entity47 's 267 - page report is separate from a grand jury investigation into charges of perjury and failure to report abuse against @entity108 , a former athletics director for the school , and @entity129 , a former vice president			1
@entity3 review recasts story of football hero @entity75 trustee @entity133 , head of the committee addressing the @entity25 scandal , said thursday that the school 's board of trustees is " deeply ashamed " by its lack of oversight identified in the report			1
the board met again on friday for a regularly scheduled session , and again pledged to make good on implementing the changes			1
they made some changes friday including reducing the term of board members from 15 years to 12 years			1
this change applies to board members elected this year			2
the board also voted to add 30 minutes of public comment during future board meetings			2
it has not gone unnoticed that the school has been up front and cooperative with investigators from various organizations since the scandal surfaced last year , said @entity160 , a spokesman for the @entity161 , which issues the school 's academic accreditation			1
because university leaders have acknowledged a problem and have been up front , it seems unlikely the school will risk losing that accreditation , @entity160 said			1
" that being said , the commission certainly feels there are problems that need to be addressed			0
" read the report here ( @entity176 ) it is less clear what the @entity13 and @entity14 inquiries will bring the school			2
in november , the @entity13 notified @entity3 that it was looking into the school 's compliance with the @entity183 , a federal law that requires universities to report crimes on or near campus and provide timely warnings if reported crimes threaten the campus community			1
in his report , @entity47 said top university officials forged an agreement to conceal @entity25 's sexual attacks more than a decade ago , outlining a culture of secrecy while pointing to an incident in which janitors aware of the abuse took no action , out of fear			1
" they witness what i think in the report is probably the most horrific rape that 's described , " @entity47 told reporters			2
" and what do they do ? they panic			0
" one janitor , a @entity209 veteran , said it was " the worst thing he 's ever seen			2
" he and other janitors were " alarmed and shocked , " but were afraid that if they reported it , they 'd be fired			0
the law carries fines of up to $ 27,500 per violation , but more critically , schools that fail to comply can be suspended from the federal financial aid program , according to the @entity13			0
a department spokesman did not immediately return a telephone message left friday seeking an update on the investigation			0
key passages from the report the @entity14 said thursday that it is reviewing @entity47 's report and is awaiting the school 's response to a november 17 letter seeking answers to questions about @entity3 's institutional control and ethics policies			1
that letter called the allegations " deeply troubling " and said that , if confirmed , appear to show conduct " starkly contrary to the values of higher education , as well as the @entity14			2
" the organization has not said what penalties the university could face , and the media relations office did not immediately return a message left friday			2
common penalties include public reprimands and censures , according to the @entity14 website			0
a ban on participation in postseason tournaments and television appearances are less commonly applied			0
recruiting restrictions , fines and scholarship reductions are also possible penalties			0
the @entity14 also has the authority to completely shut down participation in a particular sport for repeat violations , the so - called death penalty			0
@entity183 at center of @entity3 probe , 26 years after young woman 's murder the report also could play into the criminal trials for @entity108 and @entity129 , who are accused of failing to report abuse and of lying to investigators looking into the allegations against @entity25 last year			2
their attorney said thursday that @entity47 did not have access to critical witnesses and came up with an incomplete report			0
@entity108 's attorney termed it a " lopsided document that leaves the majority of the story untold			2
" in his report , @entity47 said he was asked by the @entity283 attorney general not to interview former coach @entity284 , instead using information from his testimony before a grand jury in november			0
criminal defense attorney @entity288 said it was " very , very important " to note that he was n't interviewed again because there are still questions about what @entity284 specifically told @entity75			0
" i think there may be an overstatement with respect to what @entity75 knew or did not know , " he told @entity0			0
" and i think one has to be very careful about that			0
keep in mind , also , @entity284 claims he made specific allegations , criminal in nature , to @entity108 and @entity129			0
but @entity108 and @entity129 out -- completely deny that			0
so there 's a contest with regard to those facts			2
" @entity306 , @entity129 's attorney , said at trial the jury will learn that there was no effort among the four leaders to conceal @entity25 's behavior			2
whether anyone else will face criminal charges remains to be seen , but @entity283 attorney general @entity315 said thursday that an investigating grand jury is continuing its work			0
the university is already facing three civil lawsuits , and @entity320 , the attorney for one @entity25 victim , said @entity47 's report documents a " colossal , monumental " failure by @entity3 leaders that provides a road map for further legal actions in the scandal			1
@entity3 community still admires @entity75 , wants to move forward @entity3 leaders disregarded victims , ' empowered ' @entity25 the shower and locker room in the campus @entity333 will be remodeled , according to university spokesman @entity334			1
some of the sexual assaults occurred in those showers			0
the plans were drawn up after @entity25 's arrest last fall , but the work wo n't be done until legal proceedings in the case are completed			1
@entity342 provided no further details			0
@entity3 president @entity344 said substantial security changes have been made in the building and other athletics facilities			0
@entity0 's @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 and @entity352 contributed to this report .			2
