-- @entity2 manager @entity1 has defended the club 's @entity4 owners telling @entity0 he has " no complaints " with the way they have done their job			1
the 18 - time @entity11 league champions were bought by the @entity13 family in 2005 but have long been targeted by the club 's supporters for running up huge debts			1
though @entity2 have recently been rated as the world 's most valuable sporting club by @entity19 they still have estimated debts of over $ 1bn , leading many fans to call for a change of ownership			1
a group of wealthy businessmen called the @entity27 tried to launch a takeover bid last season but were knocked back , and now @entity1 has insisted the current owners are doing a good job			1
is this the real @entity1 ? he told @entity0 : " the debt has come through by the club being bought out by an owner			1
you know fine well that when a business is bought it 's usually bought with debt			1
" because it 's a football club it seems to attract a different type of negative reporting via the media and , particularly some of our fans			1
" but @entity2 , when it went plc , it was always going to be bought			1
so when a particular family like the @entity13 have bought it , it 's unfair they come in for criticism because anybody could have bought it			1
" i have to say they 've done their job well			0
they support myself , the manager , they 've supported the players			2
i 've never been refused when i 've asked for money for a player			0
" so what can i do other than carry on the way we 're doing it and the way i 'm allowed to carry on , i 've no complaints			2
'' @entity1 is about to enter his 24th season as manager of one of the world 's most high profile clubs			1
in that time he has won 11 @entity11 league titles and two @entity74			0
speaking to @entity76 anchor @entity75 on the club 's pre-season tour of the @entity4 , 68 - year - old @entity1 reiterated his desire to continue as manager as long as he retains his health			1
he said : " i 'm at the right club , it 's a fantastic club , it demands a challenge all the time			2
every day , every year there 's the challenge of being at the top and that helps me			2
i think you need good natural energy and i 've been blessed with that			0
" what you have to do is maintain the success of the club and make sure no matter when i quit the club is always in good hands and that 's when i come back to the point about having young players			2
" there 's no need for a complete overhaul of the playing squad			0
i 've got 12 players aged 21 or under which means the future should be pretty secure with them			0
" whenever i do go , and i do n't seeing that being tomorrow , having my health is important			0
if i 've got my health i can carry on			0
there will be a point when i do quit but when it is i 've absolutely no idea			0
" i tried it a few years ago and it was an absolute disaster			0
my wife made me change my mind and she was dead right			0
but when the time comes , i think the club should be ok			0
