-- @entity1 is officially opening up its recommendation service , @entity3 , to the public			1
we wrote about the project when it was still in beta in january			0
the service is @entity10 meets @entity11 and it shares a lot of similarities with the new @entity14			1
the idea @entity16 is to leverage users ' existing social graphs alongside traditional , location - based business search			0
so if i look up " movie theater " in @entity22 , @entity23 , i can see not just a listing of places , but also how many people have rated the place as a " favorite " and if any of my friends have rated or favorited it as well			0
right now , @entity3 integrates with @entity30 , so you can ask questions via @entity3 and on @entity30 to receive recommendations and answers to your queries			1
we assume that @entity3 will integrate with @entity38 in the future as well			2
although open to the public , the product is still very much in beta			0
while the interface seems easy enough to use , i had lots of duplicate or outdated entries in my search results			0
this is something that can be cleaned up , but right now it 's difficult to rate or favorite a place when it is listed numerous times			0
while location - based search paired with reviews from others and from your own social graph is a very cool concept , it 's also not very original at this point			0
@entity1 has been developing @entity3 for more than a year and a half , so this is n't so much a case of being late to the party as it is poor timing -- and poor naming			1
one of the biggest questions we have about @entity3 is , in truth , its name			2
@entity70 came to the market first , followed by @entity72 earlier this year			0
it 's understandable that with a private beta already underway , @entity1 would n't want to change product names ; however , in this case , we think the company should have considered it			2
@entity72 coupled with @entity14 is extremely similar to what @entity3 is all about			2
the only real difference is that @entity3 is designed to plug into @entity30 , whereas @entity82 is using its own social graph			1
@entity30 integration sounds like a plus , but at this stage , the extent of the integration and how useful it will be largely depends on how many of your friends are going to sign up and use @entity3			1
@entity72 is n't the only service that @entity3 is going against ; @entity92 , @entity93 and more location - based social networks like @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity98 are all in this same territory			1
what value is @entity100 going to offer users that these already established services do n't ? from what we can see , @entity3 is really an attempt to modernize the aging @entity11 ecosystem			1
with @entity14 , @entity11 has increased competition , and we think that @entity3 will need to get some killer features -- like pulling in recommendations from other location - based sites and promoting special offers or coupons -- and that the @entity11 database will need to be seriously culled in order for this idea to take hold			1
@entity1 says it wants to use its experience in building mobile applications to make @entity3 a more mobile destination			1
while a default @entity3 connect / search bar might have worked in the pre-smartphone era , we live in the world of " there 's an app for that			2
" @entity3 will also need to make its mobile applications and mobile support robust			0
in time , the site might develop into something compelling and competitive			0
however , at this stage , the entire concept strikes us as being too derivative -- in name and in function -- with myriad other services			0

new @entity140 service is a cross between @entity92 and @entity11
@entity3 integrates with @entity30
@entity1 has been developing @entity3 for more than a year and a half
