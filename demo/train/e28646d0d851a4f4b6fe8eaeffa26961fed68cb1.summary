@entity0 , @entity1 -- defense lawyers for an @entity5 private accused in the biggest intelligence leak in @entity8 history brought up saturday a purported female alter ego of @entity10 's as they seek to establish his state of mind at the time of the alleged crimes			1
the testimony came on the second day of @entity10 's @entity15 , which coincided with his 24th birthday			1
special agent @entity17 of the @entity18 ( @entity19 ) , testifying by phone from @entity21 , was asked by one of @entity10 's attorneys if he knew that the @entity5 private had an alter ego with the name , @entity27			1
the agent said he was aware @entity10 used the name in online chats			1
during questioning by @entity10 's lawyer , it was revealed that @entity10 kept a folder of articles about gender identity disorder in his living quarters			1
@entity10 is accused of leaking more than a quarter of a million classified @entity37 and @entity38 documents that ended up on the @entity40 website			1
the special agent was one of four with the @entity5 's @entity19 who testified saturday			1
his testimony included information about how the agent took custody of the computers and hardware seized from @entity10 's base and made exact digital images of them to assure that the information on them would not be lost in the event of an accident during transportation			1
another agent testified by phone from @entity59 about searching @entity10 's living space and office and a storeroom at @entity63 where he was stationed in @entity64			1
that agent said she seized several laptops , a hard drive and a device used to link computers to the secret military system where the documents @entity10 is accused of leaking were available			1
about a half a dozen computers belonging to @entity10 , or found in areas where he worked in @entity64 and @entity1 , have been taken as evidence and analyzed			2
when pressed on whether people other than @entity10 could have used those computers , @entity17 said he did not know			2
he testified that @entity10 's personal laptop , seized in @entity64 , was not password protected			2
a third agent , @entity78 , who was part of the search of @entity10 's aunt 's house in @entity83 , @entity1 , which was listed in @entity5 records as his home address , testified that a memory card containing classified information was found among @entity10 's belongings			1
it was not clear if the material on that card was the same as what was given to @entity40			0
prosecutors also called on capt. @entity95 and retired sgt. first class @entity96 to testify			0
@entity98 was @entity10 's platoon sergeant at @entity100 , in @entity101 , where @entity10 received his first intelligence training after basic training			2
@entity10 got in trouble there for posting a video on @entity107 claiming that he was working on " secret " and " classified " material , @entity98 testified			1
that violated the school 's policy , but @entity10 did not lose his security clearance			2
@entity95 , who was an officer in @entity10 's chain of command at @entity114 when @entity10 served there , spoke about the @entity5 private 's strengths at using some computer programs , and his weakness at public speaking			1
@entity10 was moved from the night shift in his unit 's intelligence office to day shift so he could get " more supervision , " @entity95 said			2
he was eventually moved back to night shift			0
@entity95 also testified about two instances in which @entity10 allegedly lost his temper and became violent with members of his unit			2
in one incident , @entity95 said he understood that @entity10 flipped a table after being reprimanded for arriving late to work			2
in that case , @entity10 was not removed from duty as an intelligence officer			0
when asked why he was allowed to stay , @entity95 said : " we needed the work			0
" in the second incident , which led to @entity10 being moved from an area where he did intelligence work to a storeroom , the @entity5 private allegedly assaulted a fellow soldier			1
finally , @entity95 testified that a sergeant who counseled @entity10 about his behavior wrote letters about @entity10 's emotional problems , but did n't show them to @entity95 until after @entity10 's arrest			0
one of those letters referred to a photograph in which @entity10 appeared dressed as a woman			0
the sergeant should have informed him as soon as he learned about @entity10 's gender identity issues , @entity95 said , so that action could have been taken			1
the @entity8 has charged @entity10 with 22 counts of violating military code , ranging from the theft of records to aiding the enemy			0
experts say conviction on the latter charge probably would land @entity10 in prison for life			0
but , if a general sees fit , the law would allow @entity10 to be eligible for the death penalty			0
@entity10 's @entity15 hearing , the military equivalent of a grand jury hearing that will determine whether enough evidence exists to merit a court - martial , is expected to last at least a week			0
testimony is scheduled to resume sunday morning			1
most of the first day of @entity10 's hearing on friday focused on a defense motion seeking the recusal of the hearing 's investigative officer			0
as the investigating officer , lt. col. @entity182 oversees the hearing and will make a recommendation when it 's complete about what , if any , charges manning should face at court - martial			0
defense attorney @entity190 alleged that @entity182 may be prejudiced and should step down			0
among @entity192 ' objections was that @entity182 , an @entity193 , has a conflict of interest because of his civilian job with the @entity197 , which is investigating @entity40 founder @entity198			0
@entity182 denied the motion for recusal , and @entity190 immediately appealed to the @entity201 , which denied @entity190 ' motion again on friday night .			0
