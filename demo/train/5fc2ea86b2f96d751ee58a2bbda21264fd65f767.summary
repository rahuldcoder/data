-- over the past two years , 12 @entity1 have been charged with supporting militant groups fighting in @entity3 or have died while fighting with such groups			1
who are they ? of the dozen @entity1 drawn to fight with @entity6 or the @entity7 affiliated @entity8 , a profile does appear to be emerging : they are young , typically high school graduates and college students , who are self - recruited online by what they view as exciting video propaganda pouring out of @entity6 and @entity13 , and they seek to reach the @entity3 battlefields by traveling via @entity15			1
the dozen @entity1 are a rainbow of ethnicities ; of @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity23 - @entity1 descent , according to a survey by @entity25			2
for example , @entity26 , a 24 - year - old man of @entity28 descent from @entity29 , pleaded guilty last year to attempting to provide material support to a terrorist organization			0
in the plea agreement , he admitted that he had fought in @entity3			0
none of the dozen appears to be of @entity3 descent			1
this is in contrast to the some 30 @entity1 who were drawn to fight in @entity39 from 2007 onward alongside the @entity7 affiliated @entity40			0
they were largely of @entity39 descent and were overwhelmingly from @entity42 , where there is a large @entity39 - @entity1 population			2
the 12 @entity1 militants drawn to the @entity3 conflict come from a wide range of states : @entity29 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity42 , @entity52 , @entity53 and @entity54			1
they are also generally young with an average age of 24			0
three teenagers are among those charged : -- @entity59 , a 19 - year old @entity29 woman pleaded guilty last month to attempting to join @entity6			0
-- @entity61 , a 19 - year - old @entity51 man arrested this month , allegedly sought to join @entity6			0
-- @entity63 from @entity64 was 18 when he was charged last year with seeking to support @entity13 in @entity3			2
the @entity1 seeking to fight in @entity3 are not a particularly educated group			1
for the nine of the 12 individuals for whom educational attainment is known , none graduated from college			0
perhaps critically , all but two of the 12 were active on jihadi social media			1
@entity6 in particular has made a determined effort to recruit @entity76 fighters over social media , for example releasing a 55 - minute @entity80 propaganda and recruitment video on @entity82 last month			1
the heavy social media use of individuals traveling to @entity3 is something of a boon for @entity1 security services			1
the social media use of @entity89 , a 33 - year - old man from @entity42 , who died fighting with @entity6 in august , reportedly landed him on a terrorist watch list and helped the @entity1 track him			1
once individuals are radicalized and are convinced to join @entity6 or @entity13 , they often decide to travel to @entity3 through @entity15			1
-- @entity93 , a 22 - year - old from @entity50 , explained how he traveled to @entity15 and met up with jihadist facilitators there in a propaganda video that was released in august after he died conducting a suicide bombing in @entity3			1
-- @entity89 also traveled through @entity15 earlier this year			2
-- @entity98 , a 20 - year - old from @entity99 , @entity29 , was arrested in july for passport fraud en route to @entity15 allegedly to join @entity6			0
-- @entity61 purchased tickets to travel to @entity15 via @entity105 according to the complaint filed in his case			0
the importance of the @entity15 route into @entity3 likely provides the key to reduce the number of @entity1 traveling to fight in @entity3			1
for example , look at the case of @entity114 , a 44 - year - old from @entity53 , who sought to travel to fight in @entity3 but has not been charged with a terrorism - related crime			2
he was turned back at @entity119 by @entity15 authorities this summer			0
there are reports that @entity15 may be stepping up its efforts to close the routes that allow foreigners to reach the @entity3 conflict and join jihadist groups			1
we can only hope that is the case			0
@entity1 law enforcement has also made a determined effort to track @entity1 engaged in the @entity3 conflict			1
seven of the 12 individuals charged in the past two years were monitored closely by an @entity136 informant			0
even in the case of @entity93 , who returned from training in @entity3 to the @entity1 in may 2013 , a tip to the @entity136 from a friend he tried to recruit when he was back in the @entity1 placed him on the @entity136 's radar			2
still there are limits to that tracking			0
fbi director @entity145 was asked by the @entity146 show " @entity149 " earlier this month whether he knew the identity of the dozen or so @entity1 believed to be fighting in @entity3			2
@entity145 said , " i think of that , dozen or so , i do			0
i hesitate only because i do n't know what i do n't know			0

12 @entity1 have been charged with supporting militant groups in @entity3 or have died there
@entity155 : they are young , mostly not college grads , likely to have traveled through @entity15
none is of @entity3 descent ; they represent a wide *mix* of ethnic *backgrounds* , he says
@entity165 : all but two of the 12 were active on jihadi social media
