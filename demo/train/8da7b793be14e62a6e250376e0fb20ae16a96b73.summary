@entity0 , @entity1 -- forget the ads , the weather , and all those back - and - forth attacks -- the @entity7 caucuses in @entity1 will come down to thousands of small pieces of paper			1
while @entity1 @entity10 famously caucus by literally standing up for their chosen candidate , the @entity1 's @entity7 holds secret ballot votes			1
here 's how the unique process will work : on caucus night , would - be voters will gather in 809 locations across the state -- school gyms , churches and auditoriums of all shapes			1
to participate , each person must be a registered @entity7 who will turn 18 by the general election on november 6			1
but , in a closely watched twist , voters can switch party affiliation at the caucus and register as @entity7 that night			1
" from a process standpoint , it 's a nightmare , " said @entity29 @entity7 chairman @entity28 , " but i think it 's a good thing			1
people can decide they want to be involved up to the very last minute			2
" republicans this year hope that ability leads to a surge of registrations from disgruntled @entity10 and independents			2
but the practice also allows potential cross-party sabotage , where members of one party can participate in a rival caucus in order to vote for the candidate they see as the weakest potential opponent			2
all registrations must be complete by 7 p.m. , when the caucuses begin , in order for people to participate			2
inside each caucus , party officials will first conduct some housekeeping , including the approval of the person who will chair the meeting			0
then comes the only campaigning allowed			0
each candidate may select one person to give a short speech on his or her behalf			0
often , these are limited to just two or three minutes apiece			0
" it 's hard to get people to speak , " insisted @entity64 , former chairman of the @entity66 republicans			1
" i assure you every candidate right now is still out hustling to find speakers for every precinct in @entity1			1
and in some of the smaller precincts they wo n't get anybody			0
" after the speeches , it 's time to vote			1
now we get into some technical truth			0
the @entity1 @entity7 caucuses vote in what is actually a nonbinding poll , sometimes called the presidential straw poll			1
the results do not mandate how convention delegates are divided per se			2
so why does everyone care so much , you ask ? good question			0
for one , the vote measures who 's present at the caucuses			1
that 's important because in a later business item , caucus - goers determine who will represent them at the party conventions , which will determine the national delegates from @entity1			1
thus , the caucus poll is seen as the best indicator of how the state 's delegates ultimately could be divided			1
the second and simpler , answer : the caucus poll is the first statewide vote in the presidential nomination contest			1
it is the first test of a wide field of candidates			0
this brings us to a current complaint about the @entity1 caucuses : their track record at picking a nominee			1
several recent @entity7 winners in @entity1 have petered out after the @entity1 caucuses , including @entity122 in 2008 , @entity123 in 1988 , and @entity124 in 1980			1
( though in the case of the elder @entity124 , that 1980 @entity1 victory put him on course to become @entity129 's vice-presidential pick and then president himself			1
) @entity131 brush off this complaint			0
" the @entity1 caucuses are n't here to pick the next nominee , " said @entity133 , chairman of the @entity134			1
" the @entity1 caucuses are here to cull the herd a little bit			1
" and that culling happens with the caucus vote			2
caucus - goers select their candidate on simple paper ballots			1
how this happens varies widely from county by county			0
in many places , these are blank pieces of paper on which each person writes down a single name and hands it in			2
in some places there is a list of candidates printed for people to circle or check			0
at all caucus sites , voters can write in the name of anyone they like			0
it is not limited to official presidential candidates			0
that means you could vote for your boss , your sister or even @entity171			2
( though a vote for @entity171 would be wasted , since he 's @entity173 and not old enough to become president			1
) next , the votes are collected and counted by hand			0
each campaign has the option of sending a monitor to watch the process			0
often these are the same folks who spoke on the candidates ' behalf			0
how long does counting take ? when will we get results ? it depends on the size of the caucus			0
in smaller precincts , this will take just minutes and results could be ready before the clock strikes 7:30 p.m. in other places , it may take 90 minutes or more to count and recount the ballots			2
finally a point person calls in the results to state @entity7 headquarters			1
the field of candidates is likely culled			0
the process overall is on the heavy participation end of the election spectrum			0
it is heavily decentralized , with county parties retaining strong control over specifics			0
and it emphasizes passionate community participation			0
all that requires a lot of planning and an army of volunteers			0
and @entity131 boast about that , almost in dare - like fashion , to the other states salivating in envy at their state 's first - in - the - nation status			2
" i have a feeling that if some of those states , like @entity229 , who wanted an earlier primary , actually tried to do a caucus , that they would be overwhelmed by the amount of work involved , " @entity225 , chairman of the @entity226 , told @entity2			2
" they 'd be happy to remain fourth or fifth in line instead			0

on *tuesday* night , @entity1 republicans will gather for 809 caucuses across the state
they *'ll* cast paper ballots for their choice for the nomination , and it could be anybody
it 's the first actual vote in the march toward the @entity7 convention
