-- @entity3 on monday proposed replacing the 1953 armistice that ended the @entity5 with a formal peace treaty , a step it said would pave the way for breaking the international impasse over its nuclear program			1
but the communist state said international sanctions imposed after a series of nuclear weapons and missile tests should be lifted before it returns to the negotiating table , a suggestion the @entity17 quickly dismissed			2
the cease - fire that ended the three - year @entity5 never led to a permanent peace treaty , leaving the @entity3 - @entity21 border the world 's most heavily militarized frontier			2
in a statement carried by the official news agency @entity25 , @entity3 said that a final settlement of the conflict is " essential " to talks aimed at persuading it to dismantle its nuclear program			0
" when the parties are in the state of war where they level guns at each other , distrust in the other party can never be wiped out , and the talks themselves can never make smooth progress , much less realizing the denuclearization , " it said			0
" without settling such [ an ] essential and fundamental issue as war and peace , no agreement can escape from frustration and failure as now			0
" @entity47 has refused to return to the talks , which also involve the @entity17 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity21 and @entity51 , insisting that it wants to talk directly with the @entity17 government			1
but @entity54 says it will not lift sanctions or normalize relations with the @entity3 until it takes irreversible steps toward dismantling its nuclear program			1
" we 're not going to pay @entity3 for coming back to the six - party process , " @entity61 spokesman @entity60 said monday .			0

@entity66 ended @entity5 in 1953 ; @entity67 suggests replacing with treaty
it suggests that such a move would ease return to nuclear talks
@entity47 wants sanctions off table before talks *continue*
@entity54 has refused to normalize relations until program dismantled
