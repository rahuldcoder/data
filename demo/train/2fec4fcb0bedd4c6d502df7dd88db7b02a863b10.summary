@entity0 -- voters who are fed up with endless gridlock might be disappointed if they expect a @entity4 now controlled by @entity5 to change things			1
one congressional expert put it bluntly : " the basic factors causing [ gridlock ] are not gone , " said @entity11 , a professor at @entity12			2
" so it is likely that we will have a lot of delay and stalemate in the @entity4			0
" the stark reality is republicans do n't have the 60 votes they need to overcome @entity22 filibusters , making it hard to pass many of their priorities			0
but perhaps the biggest obstacle for @entity5 -- the next election			1
@entity4 aides from both parties and outside congressional observers agree that political positioning for the upcoming 2016 presidential and congressional elections will likely dominate the day - to - day workings of the @entity4 , while @entity5 leaders believe it is important they show the country they can pass legislation and govern effectively , @entity35 will likely do everything they can to block @entity5 achievements because they think they have a good chance of winning back the chamber in 2016			1
in that cycle , @entity5 need to defend 24 seats -- many from politically divided states -- while @entity35 only have to defend 10 , most of which are from blue states			1
" look , the @entity35 see an opportunity to keep the @entity54 in 2016 and pick up seats and get the majority back , " said a @entity5 @entity4 aide predicting @entity35 will refuse to work with them			1
complicating matters for @entity5 is an expected tug of war within their party , with potential 2016 presidential contenders trying to assert their conservative credentials while other @entity62 in competitive states try to appeal to moderate voters			1
" i think it 's going to be a little bit more chaotic and disorderly , " said @entity65 , of the @entity66 , a conservative think tank			2
in addition , it 's unclear how president @entity72 will respond to a @entity73 fully in @entity5 control , and whetherl he will make a genuine effort to cut hard - to - reach compromises or be more aloof , choosing to shore up his legacy over the last two years of his term by issuing executive orders on immigration and other priorities			1
@entity83 @entity82 sen. @entity82 , currently the @entity4 minority leader , is set to take over the powerful top job in the @entity4 when the new @entity73 convenes in january			1
after complaining for years that the @entity35 put politics ahead of a well - functioning @entity4 , @entity85 has vowed to return to " regular order " so that budgets , spending bills , and other items are approved months before the threat of a government shutdown or fiscal cliff looms			1
but his longtime sparring partner , sen. @entity94 of @entity95 , is sure to challenge him on anything @entity35 oppose			2
" i think there will continue to be a battle between @entity94 and @entity85			0
they do n't like each other , " @entity99 said			0
" @entity94 will use delaying tactics as a minority leader , threatening filibusters			0
i do n't think @entity5 will have 60 votes so they ca n't overcome that			2
" the particular dynamics of the @entity5 conference make it even more difficult for @entity85 to manage the @entity4			2
on one side of his conference he has three tea party senators -- @entity115 of @entity83 , @entity116 of @entity117 and @entity118 of @entity119 -- who may seek the @entity5 nomination for president and who will be reluctant to cut deals with @entity35 as they work to attract conservative primary voters			1
on the other side are a dozen or more senators who will be up for re-election in purple and blue states -- such as @entity134 of @entity135 and @entity136 of @entity137 -- who may want work across the aisle to show the broad base of voters in their states that they helped cut through the @entity0 gridlock			0
" i think he will be constantly maneuvering and using duct tape and glue to keep his conference together , " @entity65 said of @entity85			0
in fact , @entity118 has already proposed a ten - step plan he 'd like republicans to follow next year			0
he argued , in a recent @entity152 column , his plan would prove to voters @entity5 senators take seriously their desire to change @entity0			2
his ideas include implementing tax reform , passing a balanced budget amendment to the @entity160 , reforming federal education policies , auditing the @entity162 , and repealing or reforming @entity163			0
one of @entity5 ' top priorities will be to rework parts of @entity163 , with the recognition they wo n't be able to repeal the law in its entirety because of president @entity72 's veto authority			1
but they at least want to make changes to the individual and employer mandates , get rid of the medical device tax , and pass other reforms			0
" i think it 's more likely we 'll have a step - by - step approach to dismantling it and replacing it with consumer oriented , more cost - effective health care that wo n't interfere with the doctor / patient relationship , " said sen. @entity175 of @entity119 , the second - ranking @entity5 senator			1
" that 's what the @entity185 people want and that 's what our goal is to provide			2
" another major concern among @entity5 is @entity72 's plan to use his executive authority to change immigration laws , something he may announce shortly after the election			1
@entity5 hope to be in a stronger position to push back on those changes now that they will control both the @entity54 and @entity4			2
republicans also want to pass several energy bills , including approval of the @entity202			0
and they and want to push through a variety of job creation bills that passed in the @entity5 - controlled @entity54 last @entity73 but that were never taken up by @entity35			1
bipartisan support is possible on pending trade bills supported by the @entity54			0
one of the biggest changes to @entity210 life that @entity85 says he will institute is to have the @entity4 work an actual five day work week			0
under @entity94 , the @entity4 typically was in session only four days a week , with truncated schedules on monday and thursday			0
but doing so well test @entity85 's ability as leader because members of both parties -- most of who travel back and forth to their states each weekend to be with their families and constituents -- have enjoyed the luxury of the shortened @entity4 week .			0

@entity82 is set to lead the @entity5 senate and vowed to restore ' regular order '
however factors like the 2016 elections may give @entity35 incentive to block @entity5 efforts
one question will be how the @entity5 *decides* to address @entity72 's health care law
another issue is immigration though chances look slim for sweeping legislation
