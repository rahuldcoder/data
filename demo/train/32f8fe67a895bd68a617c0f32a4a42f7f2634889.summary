-- either @entity1 got really popular last weekend , or something funky was going on with his @entity4 feed			1
the @entity7 presidential nominee 's account on the site , which had been gaining followers at a clip of about 3,000 to 4,000 a day , appears to have gained more than 116,000 followers friday and another 24,000 on saturday			1
that 's according to @entity13 , an online tool that charts the number of followers that @entity4 accounts have over time			1
other tools show slightly different numbers and space the gains out differently over a three - day period			0
the spike was noticed by @entity24 , who runs @entity25 , which monitors social - media activity in politics			0
he charted the growth as 23,926 new followers on friday , 93,054 on saturday and 25,432 more on sunday			0
with political campaigns increasingly using social media as a tool to communicate with supporters , a strong presence on sites like @entity33 and @entity4 is regarded as a measure of relevance			2
as such , some politicians have been accused of using tricks to artificially inflate their online presence			0
for example , @entity1 's opponent in the primaries , former house speaker @entity45 , was dinged by a report that as few as 8 % of his 1.3 million @entity4 followers were real			1
the rest were drummed up by a program that creates fake accounts to swell someone 's follower ranks , the report said			0
( the campaign denied it			0
) @entity1 had about 807,000 followers tuesday morning , up from about 670,000 four days ago			1
the @entity1 campaign says it had nothing to do with the spike in the former @entity63 governor 's follower list			1
" we have reached out to @entity4 to find out additional information regarding the rapid growth , " campaign spokesman @entity64 told @entity65			2
the campaign did not immediately respond to @entity0 's message seeking comment for this story			0
@entity24 told @entity73 , a @entity0 content partner , that someone else may have added fake followers in an effort to embarrass the @entity1 campaign			1
he said the new followers do n't appear to come from any legitimate increase in popularity			0
@entity24 's analytics did n't show any increase in @entity4 mentions , retweets or other signs that typically would accompany organic growth on the site , he said			1
several online services offer clients the chance to " buy " @entity4 followers , although their sites are vague about where the followers come from or how they are acquired			2
one such service , @entity95 , promises to supply 25,000 new followers for a fee of $ 225			0
even with the bump , @entity1 remains far behind president @entity99 on @entity4			2
@entity99 has about 17.8 million @entity4 followers -- and , it should be noted , the built - in advantage of having been president of the @entity103 for the past 3Â½ years .			2

@entity1 sees a large increase in the number of his followers on @entity4
the @entity7 's account gained more than *140,000* followers in just two days
the campaign denies *gaming* the numbers , which some say appear artificial
analyst says spike could have been faked to embarrass @entity1
