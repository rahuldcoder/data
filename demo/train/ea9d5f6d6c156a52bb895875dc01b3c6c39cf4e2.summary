@entity0 , @entity1 -- undeterred by an overnight crackdown by authorities , protesters in the center of the @entity1 capital , @entity0 , rebuilt barricades wednesday that had been torn down hour earlier by riot police			1
as the day continued , police pulled back from the city 's @entity11 , or @entity11 , and the country 's leaders sought to play down fears of a further clampdown			2
earlier , hundreds of officers used chainsaws to pull down the barriers , which had been manned by @entity21 demonstrators			0
clashes led to reports of injuries on both sides			2
angry about the refusal of @entity1 's @entity29 - allied president @entity28 to sign an agreement that would strengthen cooperation with the @entity32 , thousands of demonstrators have been camped out for days in @entity11			1
they also continue to occupy @entity0 's @entity34			2
wednesday 's predawn crackdown on protesters brought condemnation from @entity21 leaders			1
but @entity41 assistant secretary of state @entity40 , after a two - hour meeting with @entity28 on wednesday , said there was still " a way out " for his government			1
" it was a tough conversation , but it was a realistic one , " she told reporters in @entity0			0
" i made it absolutely clear to him that what happened last night , what has been happening in security terms here , is absolutely impermissible in a @entity55 state , in a democratic state			2
" but we also made clear that we believe there is a way out for @entity1 , that it is still possible to save @entity1 's @entity55 future and that ... we want to see the president lead			1
" a picture posted to @entity63 by the @entity41 ambassador to @entity1 , @entity65 , showed @entity40 handing food earlier wednesday to security forces and protesters in the square			1
talks @entity28 called for talks			1
" i invite representatives of all political forces , priests , public figures to hold the nationwide dialogue , " he said on the official presidency website			1

" but his jailed chief political opponent , @entity85 , dismissed any call for negotiations , urging @entity1 to " stand up , " and repeating previous opposition calls for early elections			1
" no negotiations or roundtables with bandits -- only the immediate resignation of @entity28 and his entourage , " a statement posted on her official website said			1
" i also appeal to the leaders of the democratic world			0
every time a @entity103 ( riot police ) baton strikes a blow on a peaceful protester defending @entity11 it is a blow to the universal values that you are trying to make the foundation of human life			0
" @entity85 has been in jail for two years after being convicted of abuse of power in 2011			0
the verdict was decried by the @entity32 and other critics as a sham			0

" i want to reassure everyone -- there will be no crackdown of the @entity11 , " he said , according to the official @entity129 news agency			2

however , one can not ignore the rights and lawful interests of other citizens			0
" before that , the @entity140 said 10 policemen were injured between 1 a.m. and 4 a.m. while acting on a court order to dislodge protesters from the city center and restore the free movement of traffic			0
it was not clear how many protesters were hurt in the clashes			0
city officials put the number at 30 , while health minister @entity153 said 13 were hurt			2
footage from the scene showed black - helmeted , heavily armored riot police advancing toward the protesters , who were wearing orange hard hats			0
@entity1 opposition leader @entity159 , a former heavyweight boxing champion , said @entity28 had " burned the bridge to a civilized resolution of the political crisis , " according to his @entity163			1
@entity159 said the demonstrators ' goals were " a full reload of the government and punishment for those guilty in clearing up the protests			0
" meanwhile , @entity1 prime minister @entity171 told a government meeting wednesday that @entity1 was still open to signing the @entity55 integration deal if the @entity32 would agree to providing financial assistance to @entity1 of around 20 billion euros ( $ 27.5 billion )			2
he suggested @entity55 officials were more interested in monitoring the protests than in discussing a financial deal that would benefit the @entity1 people , according to a government news release			0
@entity41 ' disgust ' at crackdown in @entity184 , @entity183 spokeswoman @entity182 told reporters that " all options " were under consideration in @entity1 , including sanctions			1
@entity41 secretary of state @entity189 condemned the crackdown on protesters			1
" the @entity41 expresses its disgust with the decision of @entity1 authorities to meet the peaceful protest in ... @entity198 with riot police , bulldozers , and batons , rather than with respect for democratic rights and human dignity , " he said in a statement			1
" this response is neither acceptable , nor does it befit a democracy			0
" @entity189 urged the " utmost restraint " by authorities , saying " human life must be protected			1

" the concerns of protesters should be met with dialogue , not violence , " he said			0
the police crackdown came hours after @entity32 foreign policy chief @entity221 met with @entity28 and visited the protest site in the central square			1
" the moves that were made to try and clear the blockades were done in a way that was unacceptable , " @entity224 told @entity2 in @entity0 on wednesday			0
" and when i spoke with ( @entity28 ) for three - and - a - half hours yesterday , one of the things we talked about was the importance of dialogue and the importance of convening what the three former presidents have described as ... a roundtable			1
... it 's harder to convene a dialogue when people have seen what they believe has been inappropriate action			2
" @entity224 had met tuesday with opposition leaders			0
the scenes of protest are reminiscent of the uprising that swept @entity28 from office nine years ago during the @entity247 , when he was prime minister			1
east vs. @entity248 @entity28 's refusal to sign the @entity32 deal represents a u-turn in the country 's advance toward closer relations with the @entity21			1
an @entity32 agreement would have opened borders to trade and set the stage for modernization and inclusion , protesters say			0
they accuse @entity28 of preparing to take the country into a @entity263 - led customs union			2
@entity263 has leverage that may have affected @entity28 's decision to backpedal on the @entity32 talks because @entity29 supplies @entity1 with natural gas			1
@entity28 said tuesday that he was " strongly against opposing relations with @entity55 in favor of relations with @entity29 and vice versa			2
" the @entity32 is also pressuring @entity28 to free @entity85 the @entity247 that swept @entity28 from office in 2004 also brought the @entity273 to power			2
