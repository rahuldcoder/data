@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity4 - affiliated website has released video that purports to show suicide bombers who targeted @entity0 's @entity7 in june preparing for the attack in the hills and studying a tiny model of the hotel in detail			1
the video -- released on a @entity4 - affiliated website in the past few days -- is an hour long			1
it includes testimony and footage - - even gymnastics -- from the seven attackers who killed 11 more people when they laid siege to a government conference at the hotel for six hours			1
the attack -- one of the most brazen and penetrating to hit the capital -- was eventually suppressed by special forces , helicopters and a drone			1
one of the apparent suicide bombers , @entity30 , speaks of his motivation to take his own life and that of others			0
" my message is life is too short , " he says			0
" you can die of cancer , or a car accident			0
if you want @entity41 's blessing , be a suicide attacker			0
" @entity2 can not prove the authenticity of the elaborate video			2
the images also show masked and uniformed men training in the hills , the exercises they undertake clearly designed to show they are a more disciplined force than parts of the @entity4 have been in the past			2
in one scene , they appear to attack an @entity1 military vehicle , killing the troops and stealing their weapons and uniforms			2
the footage is undated and the mountainous location where it was shot is unclear			0
the hotel attackers are also filmed in a room sitting in a circle , surrounding a realistic mock - up of the @entity7			1
a tutor , whose face and voice are not discernible , offers tactical tips for the assault			0
" those of you with machine guns and rocket - propelled grenades , get on the roof and use it as a control tower , so the enemy ca n't enter easily			0
" the video shows footage of the attack obscured by darkness , but the tracer fire of the attackers , and their @entity87 and @entity1 opponents is visible			1
the attack caused considerable concern in @entity0 , the first of several attributed to the @entity91 that penetrated the capital 's so - called @entity92			1
the video is possibly also the first detailed glimpse of a part of the insurgency that is rapidly becoming @entity99 's main opponent here			0
the @entity91 , a group of militants active in @entity1 's east but accused of receiving sanctuary and logistical support in @entity104 , were blamed for the @entity7 attack and some observers have suggested the pictures are in fact a rare insight into the network			1
the insurgent group -- which is linked to the @entity4 but often considered a more sophisticated and independent adjunct to it -- has rarely been filmed .			2

the hour - long video was released on a @entity4 - affiliated website
the attack was one of the most brazen to hit @entity0
the video includes testimony and footage from seven attackers who killed 11 at the @entity7
