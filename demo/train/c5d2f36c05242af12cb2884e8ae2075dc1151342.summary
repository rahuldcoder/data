-- despite the many differences i had with former president @entity3 on a range of public policy issues , or as he called them , " decision points , " i found common ground with him in one area , simply because we decided to put aside partisanship and do something good			1
@entity14 's devastation and the bungled rescue efforts are seared in the national memory			1
@entity3 's " heckuva job " remark turned into a byword for government incompetence and public distrust			1
the shallowness of it coming at such a terrible and low point left deep wounds that are still healing			0
that was what it was			0
but rather than rehash all that went wrong , i want to share what i believe to have been president @entity3 's determination to follow up on commitments , and the intense , personal , dedicated efforts he made to revive and restore people 's futures			1
i know what i 'm talking about			0
@entity3 43 : ' @entity39 will ultimately judge ' @entity40 , @entity41 's governor in 2005 , asked me to serve on the state 's commission overseeing the long - term recovery from the damage caused by @entity14			1
i 've kept a close watch over the last eight years			0
@entity14 was n't one natural disaster : it was a triple whammy of water , winds and lawlessness			1

how will history remember @entity3 ? my older sister , @entity88 -- people sometimes thought we were twins , we looked so much alike -- was in an assisted care home			1
@entity88 developed a brain tumor in childhood			0
brain surgery left her needing help , although she still managed to finish high school and college			0
when @entity83 officials told me it might be weeks before we found @entity88 , i was furious			0
@entity0 's @entity99 made a public plea for nearby citizens to see if the residents had survived			1
@entity103 of the @entity104 , and our cousin , @entity105 , a cop , rescued her from the building 's rooftop			2

@entity88 would n't leave until she saw someone she knew			0
like so many others , she was relocated to @entity112			0
my 92 - year - old great uncle @entity113 , a @entity114 vet , was plucked from another rooftop and transported to @entity116 , @entity117 , only to suffer a heart attack			2
all seven of my remaining siblings , my father , uncle , aunts , and other relatives , lost everything in @entity14			1
i was upset -- mad as hell -- and disappointed but , i made a decision not to act out -- act against @entity3 -- but rather to turn to his administration for help , and to offer my help			1
" mr. president , " i said , " how can i help you ? " " @entity134 , " he said			0
opinion : jury is still out on @entity3 bitterness can corrode the soul			1
a grudge is like the chains on @entity142 's ghost			2
we can carry these chains in life and they weigh us down			0
president @entity145 and former president @entity3 have been working for eight years to change the atmosphere in @entity148 , to get @entity149 to move beyond pride and party			2
so far , not even disasters or tragedies that have united the @entity155 people -- @entity156 , @entity157 , and @entity158 -- have moved the politicians			0
@entity3 understood the need for civility			2
i joined him despite my frustration because the need was too great for finger - pointing and blame - making			2
he flew to @entity76 and addressed the nation : " tonight i also offer this pledge to the @entity155 people : throughout the area hit by the hurricane , we will do what it takes			2
we will stay as long as it takes to help citizens rebuild their communities and their lives			0
" glimpse at a @entity176 before everything changed @entity3 was good as his word			1

to this day , there are many local libraries with tributes devoted to her efforts			0
it was a team effort			0
i 'm glad to report the commission i served on went out - of - business in 2010			0
i 'm also grateful and proud to report that president @entity3 was one of the leaders , and a very important member , of that team			2
our recovery can be credited to the civility and tireless efforts of president @entity3 and other @entity216 , who united and worked together to help rebuild the @entity186 and the place of my birth , @entity76			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity222 .			2

@entity222 's siblings , father , uncle , aunts , and other relatives lost everything in @entity14
@entity222 : " @entity232 job " came to mean bungled rescue , incompetence and public distrust
