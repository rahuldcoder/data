@entity0 , @entity1 -- during the week before @entity5 each year , lt. @entity3 of the @entity4 in @entity1 knocks on the doors of every registered sex offender in his jurisdiction			1
@entity9 set out in his unmarked @entity10 wednesday with a printout of 20 names to verify that the people on the list live where they say they live			2
his mission brings him and members of his force to subdivisions , houses , hotels and and apartment buildings in this @entity24 bedroom community of about 85,000 people			2
" we do this to give people a level of comfort so they know we 're keeping tabs on them , " said @entity9 , a former sex crimes detective with 34 years of police experience			1
@entity0 is one of many local law enforcement agencies across the country taking extra steps this @entity5 to assure the community that the agencies are keeping track of the sex offenders living among them			1
there are 686,515 registered sex offenders in the @entity42 , according to the @entity43			1
the @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity44 says members of its @entity48 performed checks on the residences of registered sex offenders to ensure they are in compliance with the provisions of their parole or probation			1
they were also told not to decorate their homes , distribute candy , turn on their porch lights or answer the door			0
similar restrictions are in place in @entity64 , @entity65			0
" this is a proactive effort on our part to ensure community safety , " said @entity66 , spokeswoman for the @entity67			1
some registered sex offenders in parts of @entity74 , @entity46 and @entity75 must report to mandatory meetings , which critics have mockingly nicknamed " sex offender @entity5 parties , " for a few hours on saturday evening			1
in @entity9 's experience , however , most sex offenders keep to themselves on @entity5			1
in some areas , they can not attend @entity5 parties or events such as haunted houses or corn mazes			1
" they just want to stay out of trouble , " he said			0
" but it 's still incumbent on us to provide the community with the most up - to - date information about these people who are living in here			2
" technically , @entity0 police are not responsible for verifying the addresses for the state 's sex offender registry			1
as soon as all the addresses are verified , @entity9 says he includes the information in his weekly newsletter to the local homeowners ' associations			2
he 'll also notify the @entity106 , whose jurisdiction includes @entity0 , of any incorrect listings			0
after maneuvering through traffic for nearly three hours in the sprawling suburb , @entity9 had visited five residences			0
he spoke with one man , who calls a room at the @entity115 home			0
weekly rates start at $ 199			0
" they do n't have to worry about background checks in places like these , " @entity9 said as he made his way down the fluorescent - lit hallway , the faint scent of fast food wafting through the vents			0
he knocked twice , announcing himself as @entity0 police , and a tall , thin man opened the door , revealing a sliver of the pitch black room as he rubbed sleep from his eyes			2
" just checking in to verify your address			0
has anyone else been by lately ? sheriff or probation ? " @entity9 asked			0
i 'm off probation , " answered the man , who was convicted of receiving child pornography in 2001			2
" @entity143 here ? " " yes sir			0
" " thank you sir , " the man said , closing the door			0
in two other stops , @entity9 confirmed with the leasing offices that the offenders were no longer living at the listed addresses			1
he failed to gain entry to another , and spoke with the roommate of another			0
" we 'll go back until we find them , " he said			0
such measures , which have been part of the season for years now , are widely perceived to provide the community with a sense of comfort , said @entity165 , president of the @entity43			1
" we applaud and understand the vigilance that these jurisdictions want to take , and i do n't think it hurts anything , but i think it 's important not to feel a false sense of security just because registered sex offenders in the community are required to stay home with their lights off or at a counseling session			1
it 's not a panacea , it 's not a guarantee , " he said			0
@entity165 said there is no evidence of higher incidence of sex offenses against children on @entity5			1
on its web site , @entity188 , the center provides parents with tips on how to keep their kids safe on @entity5 , from supervising them on rounds to teaching children to be cautious and alert			2
" the most important thing for parents is to use this time to talk about safety with their children and share common sense lessons , like only go to homes of people you know , be aware of your surroundings			2

police in @entity1 take it upon themselves to check sex offenders ' addresses
sex offenders in parts of @entity74 , @entity46 , @entity209 must attend meetings @entity5 night
keeping tabs on sex offenders provides community with sense of comfort , police say
measures can *create* false sense of security , president of child safety group says
