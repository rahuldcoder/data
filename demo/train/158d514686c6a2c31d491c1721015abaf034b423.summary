@entity0 , @entity1 -- as winter recedes , winds whip through downtown @entity0 and chill the crowds of commuters on their way home			1
the sun is dropping and the pale golden light streams between tall buildings			0
a girl smiles as she chats excitedly on her cell phone			0
@entity14 suits cluster on a street corner debating their happy hour destination			0
nowhere is there the slightest inkling that anyone in this second largest metropolitan area in the world -- is fearful or even anxious about the stream of threats emanating from @entity25			1
just as sure as spring is coming , most seem to find it entirely normal that warnings of thermonuclear war , annihilation and utter devastation punctuate this , the season of joint @entity28 , @entity1 military maneuvers			1
opinion : why @entity25 regime is scary " we are post-war , we do n't worry about that , " a journalist specializing in local news told me			1
" we take it for granted			0
" he was just one of about 30 reporters i met in a session discussing news in the @entity1 capital this week			1
@entity0 is a scant 30 miles from the demilitarized zone dividing @entity49 -- one of the most militarized places on the planet			1
if a full - scale war were to break out , the @entity1 capital would be @entity55 's prime target			2
it might only be minutes before artillery or rockets would come raining down			0
@entity25 has an array of artillery and other conventional arms that make its military a credible threat , especially to @entity1			1
@entity55 is also believed to possess thousands of tons of chemical agents , although it has denied possessing such weapons			0
i wondered aloud if @entity1 really were n't afraid or simply felt there was nothing they could do about it anyway ? " we 're insensitive , " one offered in reply			2
it 's not the futility of fear in their predicament ; it 's that they have lived their entire lives under a cloud of threats and warnings from the @entity25			1
" we know @entity25 does n't want war , " said another			2
" they want money and food , " adding that @entity55 has tried it all -- missiles , the nuclear threat , its million man army -- to try to blackmail the @entity1			2
former @entity28 secretary of state @entity91 visited this week and told hundreds of people gathered for the @entity93 that @entity25 knew well an attack on @entity1 , much less the @entity28 , would mean a " regime ending " retaliation			1
he encouraged his mostly @entity1 audience to be optimistic because they were part of the world that has grown more democratic and wealthier , as opposed to the road chosen by the @entity102 family dynasty			2
rather than being burdened by the dark clouds of threats , @entity91 urged them to pursue jobs and human dignity , to focus on the environment and poverty reduction			0
what 's @entity111 up to ? @entity1 seem overwhelmingly willing to take that advice			2
in the week i 've been here , i have only found one woman who remembers participating in civilian air raid drills			0
" it was 30 years ago , " she told me			0
today , @entity0 's 25 million people have absolutely no ambition to live in constant fear			1
but @entity0 is n't all of @entity1			1
" it 's different for us than people on the islands , " one told me , recalling the attack in 2010 that killed four @entity1 on @entity122 island barely outside @entity25 's territorial waters			1
in @entity0 , the prospect of war is unthinkable			2
but in a select few flashpoint areas , the threat of armed provocation is very real , indeed			0
@entity1 nightmare : experts ponder potential conflict i paused on a street corner near @entity2 's @entity0 offices and looked up at the jagged peaks rising behind the @entity139 , which is the @entity1 's presidential office			1
if missiles ever did come streaking toward the @entity1 capital , they would likely arc above those mountains			0
the nearest shelter , i thought , would be the subway system			0
i considered how long it would take me to get there , even if i were lucky enough to see them still short of their targets			0
my calculations were n't at all comforting			0
then , like about everyone around me , i decided to think about something else			0
@entity155 : what are your views on @entity25 's threats ?			1

no indication of fear or anxiety in @entity0 toward @entity25 threats
@entity1 have long lived under a cloud of threats from @entity25
@entity1 seems to be carrying with life as normal
