@entity2 president @entity1 apologized for the humiliation suffered by indigenous peoples at the hands of the police over the weekend , and said his government did not mandate the attacks , state media reported late wednesday			1
" we ask for forgiveness -- forgive me , " @entity9 said , according to @entity2 's state news agency			1
" it was not an instruction by the president			2
no one in the government would have thought such an attack could happen to our indigenous brothers			2
" on sunday , 500 police tear - gassed and rousted about half of 1,500 indigenous protesters making a 300 - mile march to the capital , @entity25 , to protest a road project through a national park on their ancestral homeland			1
the marchers say four people were killed , scores of protesters were injured and several others were missing			1
on monday , @entity2 officials denied any deaths or injuries but promised to launch a full - scale investigation into the raid , which they said was undertaken to save lives and avoid confrontations			1
@entity2 indigenous leaders have vowed to keep fighting the project even though @entity9 said monday he would suspend construction pending a national dialogue			1
@entity49 leaders , who maintain the marchers were unarmed , expressed their skepticism tuesday over @entity9 ' statement			1
" we do n't believe what he says anymore , " said @entity53 , a leader of the @entity54			2
" we are reorganizing to continue this , " @entity53 told @entity57			0
" we are not going to stop until this is solved			0
monday night 's concession to suspend construction " will lower pressure but wo n't solve the problem , " said @entity60 , the @entity2 ambassador to the @entity61 from 2002 to 2006			0
" this is not an easy problem to solve			0
" at the heart of the dispute lies the construction of a highway through the @entity72 and @entity73 , a rainforest preserve commonly known by its @entity76 acronym of @entity77			0
the road , being constructed mostly by a @entity80 company , aims to give @entity80 access to @entity83 ports by connecting to highways in @entity85 and @entity86			1
@entity80 's @entity88 is financing $ 330 million of the road 's estimated $ 415 million cost , the @entity2 government has said			1
" there 's a lot of money involved , " said journalist @entity91 , who has lived in @entity2 for the past five years			0
that money has an even bigger impact on @entity2 , one of the poorest and least developed nations in @entity99			0
about one of every three @entity2 lives below the poverty level			0
" the rights of indigenous people are recognized on paper , but , unfortunately , when it comes to these big economic projects that come from the top down , these rights get swept by the wayside , " said @entity102 , a spokesman for the @entity103 advocacy group			1
there also are social concerns for a large indigenous population that is used to living in relative isolation , said @entity102 , the @entity103 spokesman			0
the indigenous movement has been on the upswing since 1990 , when a large march to @entity25 helped to solidify their power			0
that burgeoning power seemed to come to fruition in december 2005 , when @entity9 was elected the nation 's first indigenous president			0
running on a platform of empowering the nation 's indigenous majority , @entity9 won by the widest margin of any candidate since the restoration of civilian rule in 1982			0
he easily won re-election in december 2009 , when his party also gained control of the nation 's legislature			0
now many of those indigenous supporters feel @entity9 has deserted them			0
" @entity1 ' government does not respect human rights , " said indigenous leader @entity53			1
" of course , we are betrayed because the indigenous people supported him to establish a plurinational government			1
" the @entity2 government extolled the supposed benefits area residents would receive from the road , saying it would help the indigenous receive better health care and education			2
indigenous from at least 16 communities expressed their support for it			0
but many indigenous remained steadfastly opposed and were marching to @entity25 when police swooped in sunday afternoon near the town of @entity158 and carted many of them off in buses			1
authorities aimed to disperse the protesters by putting them on planes and flying them home			2
the marchers were resting , cooking dinner , washing clothes and bathing when police arrived , @entity53 said			1
" we were surprised , ambushed , assaulted and abducted by the police , " she said monday afternoon , about 24 hours after the raid			2
police efforts were thwarted , though , when local indigenous people shut down two airports and freed many of those who had been apprehended by police			1
all the protesters apparently had gained their freedom by tuesday			2
the @entity2 government initially said the police intervention had been done to protect the marchers			1
" the only reason for the action that was taken was to avoid a confrontation between civilians , " interior minister @entity180 said monday morning			0
problems started to build for @entity9 , though , a short while later when defense minister @entity186 resigned in protest over the police intervention			2
by monday afternoon , the government had ordered an investigation into whether " excessive force " had been used			0
late monday night , @entity9 said he would suspend construction during this " national debate , " saying the public would decide the road 's fate .			2
