an @entity1 - backed cease - fire between @entity2 and @entity3 fell apart tuesday as rocket attacks from @entity5 were again answered by @entity2 airstrikes			1
the rocket attacks from @entity3 militants in @entity5 never ceased , @entity2 officials said			1
for its part , @entity2 refrained from airstrikes for about six hours before announcing it was resuming them			1
a @entity15 crew witnessed at least five @entity2 strikes just as the announcement was made			1
" @entity3 closed the diplomatic option			1
we woke up this morning in the hope there 'd be a cease - fire and , as you reported , @entity2 restrained from all our activities , all action against terrorists in @entity5 for a full six hours			1
we gave this cease - fire our full support , " @entity27 , spokesman for prime minister @entity28 told @entity15 's " @entity31 with @entity32			2
" " but @entity3 said no to everyone			1
@entity3 said no to the cease - fire , both in word and in deed , " @entity27 said			1
the faltering of the cease - fire attempt means there may be little hope of seeing an end to the near constant exchange of fire that has so far killed more than 190 @entity44 in @entity5			1
the first fatality on the @entity2 side was a man killed monday after being hit by a mortar shell , @entity2 rescue services said			1
he was an @entity2 volunteer who was at the @entity52 border crossing to deliver food to soldiers			1
@entity2 leaders had agreed to the cease - fire , but from the outset warned it would be short - lived if the attacks from @entity5 did n't stop			1
the @entity2 @entity60 met early tuesday morning and decided to halt aerial strikes beginning at 9 a.m. ( 2 a.m. et )			1
it resumed strikes about six hours later , by 3 p.m. ( 8 a.m. et )			0
@entity5 crisis : who 's who in @entity3 the barrage from @entity5 continued , with more than 140 rockets fired from there since early tuesday -- or one rocket every six minutes -- according to the @entity71			1
" @entity3 have decided to continue , and will pay the price for that decision , " @entity28 said tuesday			1
his @entity60 met again late in the day for emergency talks			0
the @entity1 plan calls for all sides to cease hostilities in @entity5			1
it also calls for the opening of border crossings , once the security situation is stable , and for high - level talks among those involved			0
" the achievement of the success of this @entity1 effort is a must for all of us , " said @entity44 negotiator @entity84			0
" it 's an interest for all of us , and if we allow things to deteriorate i think it 's going to be a disaster all over			0
" he continued : " failure is not an option here			2
" when the plan was announced , there was a split reaction from @entity3			2
its military wing rejected any possibility of a cease - fire , while its political wing had said it was considering it			2
@entity106 , deputy chairman of @entity3 ' political wing , said at the outset of the @entity1 efforts that there is a bigger issue than a cease - fire for @entity44			2
he said that what @entity44 really want is an end to the @entity2 blockade on @entity5 that is suffocating the daily lives of the 1.8 million @entity44 living there			1
@entity106 , speaking on @entity3 - owned @entity118 , also accused @entity2 of not freeing @entity44 prisoners from @entity2 jails , as had been agreed to under an earlier truce			1
these , he said , are elements the @entity44 would like to see in a comprehensive cease - fire agreement			0
@entity3 spokesman @entity124 later stressed that @entity3 never received the proposal through political channels			1
" we are still working with @entity1			0
we are still talking to other sides , " he told @entity15			0
" i believe a proposal is supposed to be prepared after the sides agree on it			0
it 's supposed to be published if two sides give agreement on it			0
you ca n't publish it in the media and then ask everyone to accept that or reject that			0
" asked why @entity3 wo n't stop firing rockets while talks are ongoing , the spokesman replied : " we are not the side who is killing the other side			1
we are are the side being killed			2
" trapped in war : ' this is tyranny ' civilian casualties the stakes are high and climbing			0
by tuesday , the death toll from a week of @entity2 airstrikes on @entity5 had reached 194 , with at least 1,400 wounded , according to @entity44 health authorities			1
the toll is now greater than the number of people killed in @entity5 during the 2012 conflict between @entity2 and @entity3			1
the @entity159 has said that most of the people killed by @entity2 's aerial attacks are civilians			1
" i urgently call on the @entity2 @entity166 to put an end to attacks against , or endangering , civilians and civilian infrastructure which are contrary to international humanitarian law , " said @entity163 , commissioner general of the @entity165 , or @entity165			2
there are now 17,000 refugees taking shelter in 20 schools in @entity5 , @entity165 said , and the airstrikes have damaged 47 of its buildings , including clinics , schools and warehouses			2
the @entity2 military says it uses a variety of methods , including phone calls and leaflets , to warn civilians of impending strikes			1
" as part of our effort to avoid harming civilians , we are sending messages to residents of northern @entity5 to leave homes for their own safety , " the @entity71 posted to @entity190 late tuesday			2
but @entity165 called on @entity2 to exercise maximum restraint and precautions to avoid more casualties			2
" clearly , at this stage not enough is being done in that regard , " @entity163 said			0
@entity71 spokesman lt. col. @entity203 accused @entity3 of holding the people of @entity5 hostage			1
" they are using and abusing the houses , the infrastructure there , in order to carry out these attacks			0
we really do n't have any other choice , " he said			0
@entity3 on tuesday closed a crossing between @entity5 and @entity2 but allowed 25 @entity44 -- some of them needing medical attention -- to cross into @entity2 at @entity52			1
the border crossing at @entity52 was closed not as punitive measure , but because the @entity5 side has been targeted in airstrikes , said @entity219 , the head of the committee for border crossings in @entity5			1
employees at the crossing have been targeted three times in three days , and it was closed out of fear for the lives of the workers , he said			0
the crossing can be reopened quickly if @entity2 can guarantee the workers ' safety , he said			2
@entity233 delays trip @entity234 secretary of state @entity233 was preparing a possible trip to the @entity236 to lay groundwork for a cease - fire , but he postponed the visit to give @entity1 efforts a chance to take root			0
one official said the @entity234 wants to give @entity1 a chance to reassert itself as a power broker in the @entity236 , as it did during the 2012 cease - fire			0
@entity233 continued to follow that line tuesday			0
" the @entity1 proposal for a cease - fire and negotiations provides an opportunity to end the violence and restore calm , " @entity233 said from @entity248 , @entity249			0
" we welcome the @entity2 @entity60 's decision to accept it			2
we urge all other parties to accept the proposal			0
" @entity233 strongly condemned the rocket launches by @entity3 in the face of the cease - fire plan , and said he is prepared to fly to the @entity236 as early as wednesday , if needed			2
the current @entity1 president , the ex-military chief @entity262 , has weaker relations with @entity3 than former president @entity264 , who brokered the 2012 deal			1
@entity264 was ousted by the military in 2013			0
@entity268 president @entity267 will travel to @entity1 on wednesday to meet with the president and to discuss a possible cease - fire , the official @entity44 news agency @entity271 reported			0
@entity267 also is scheduled to visit @entity272			0
earlier , @entity233 spoke by phone with @entity28 and expressed @entity234 concerns about escalating tensions			0
he reiterated that the @entity234 is prepared to help bring about a cease - fire , a senior @entity277 official said			0
but " offering facilitation is not enough , " @entity279 of the @entity281 - based @entity280 told @entity15 's " @entity283			0
" " it 's important that the @entity234 demand a cease - fire , " he said			0
" there is no military solution to this			0
" @entity289 calls for @entity236 cease - fire fear for daughter 's @entity5 border wedding opinion : a smart way out of the @entity5 confrontation			2
