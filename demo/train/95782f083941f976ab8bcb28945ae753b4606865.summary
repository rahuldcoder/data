-- the recent email in my in - box was simply titled " @entity6 , " which in @entity1 means " work " or " a job			1
" it was from @entity10 - a jobless man we met in 2012 telling us , rather excitedly , that he 'd gotten a job , at last			1
no small feat in @entity15 's economic crisis			2
he 'd been out of work for more than three years before getting hired as a tree trimmer on a city work crew			0
we met @entity10 , who 's done all sorts of manual jobs , in june 2012 at a @entity24 food bank where he came to get a handout			1
he 'd lost his job as a waiter two years earlier			0
there was a line at the @entity24 site in the @entity32 suburb of @entity33 , and the down - on - their - luck @entity15 and immigrants waiting there did n't want to talk to @entity0 about their plight			1
he was concerned about how it would look on tv but eventually he told us that a tv interview might help him be seen by potential employers			0

" if there is just part - time work , fine , at any hour , any job , even if i have to learn it from scratch , " @entity10 told us then			1
and then described the difficulties for a single man -- he was then 48 -- in @entity15 's crisis			1
his jobless benefits had run out , he had almost no savings , and he said he was really getting by thanks to help from his elderly mother			0
in october 2012 , we covered the @entity1 @entity24 's annual fundraiser that dates back more than a century and whose proceeds usually go to help people in disaster zones abroad			2
but for the first time , the money was being used to ease suffering at home , in @entity15			2
we checked in with @entity10 again			2
he still had no job , and was not very optimistic			0
then came the joyous email about his new job			0
we went to update our story on him and found out there 's some good news and some bad news			0
yes , he 's working , but only for six months			0
at 50 , he 's learning all about tree trimming , earning minimum wage -- about $ 900 a month			1

" but it 's what there is			0
since they 've given you an opportunity , at least you 're busy			0
" the @entity1 government says the nation has been busy trying to get out of the economic crisis , and @entity15 's unemployment rate is finally starting to decline , although it 's still 26 % with 5.9 million people jobless			2
unions , citing government figures that the @entity97 confirms , say about 1.2 million jobs are being created in @entity15 each month , but that most of them are part time and temporary			1
and a third of them last less than four hours a day			0
he 'd like to get more work but thinks his chances are slim because , he says , most companies are n't hiring older workers			0
he says he 's too old to learn languages and move abroad , as many college - educated @entity15 , and even some without a degree , are doing , in search of work			1
the mayor of @entity33 , the prosperous suburb that employs @entity10 , is from @entity15 's ruling conservative party , which has been touting the economic recovery -- including the temporary jobs			1
" no , they 're not the solution to @entity15 's problem of more than five million people unemployed , " said mayor @entity117			1
" but they 're important so the long - term jobless can get training			1

" but his most immediate concern is paying the bills when this job ends in april			0
he says he 'll have to ask his elderly mother for help , again			0
we may need to check in again in the future with @entity10 .			2

@entity0 met @entity10 in 2012 , when he was unemployed , now he has a job
but the job is short term and at 50 , he 's only earning the minimum wage
this represents many jobs that are being created in @entity15 -- short - term and badly paid
questions are being raised over how much these can help the country 's long - term recovery
