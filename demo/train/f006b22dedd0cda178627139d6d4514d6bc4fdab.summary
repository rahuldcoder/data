@entity0 , @entity1 -- in an attempt to re-create the experience of a manned mission to @entity6 , an international team of researchers will lock themselves up in a windowless capsule for about a year and a half -- time required for a round trip to the @entity6			1
starting thursday , an all - male " crew " of six -- three @entity14 , a @entity15 , an @entity17 - @entity16 and a @entity18 -- will spend 520 days in the cramped and claustrophobic conditions of a special facility in @entity22 and will follow a strict regimen of exercise and diet			1
organizers at the @entity27 and @entity14 's @entity28 hope the project will shed light on the physical and psychological effects of the long isolation that future @entity6 astronauts will experience			1
" this study is not useful only for @entity6 , but also for life on @entity40 , " 27 - year - old @entity35 , the @entity17 - @entity16 participant , said in a news release			2
the researchers will communicate with mission control via the internet , with occasional disruptions and a 20 - minute delay to imitate the effects of space travel			1
they will perform tasks similar to astronauts at the international space station , such as maintenance and scientific experiments , but for a longer period of time			1
they will follow a seven - day week with two days off , except when special and emergency situations are simulated			0
the latest isolation test is the last and longest part of the @entity60 experiment that began in 2007			2
the first phase was a 14 - day simulation that mainly tested the facilities and operational procedures			0
the second phase followed in 2009 , when four @entity14 and two @entity67 crew members were shut into the facility for 105 days			0
missions to the @entity6 have thus far been unmanned			2
in january , @entity70 told @entity2 that the agency was close to a deal to merge its @entity6 program with the @entity27 's , a big step toward manned missions			0
in the meantime , @entity70 is preparing for the launch of its newest robotic space exploration vehicle , the @entity78 , late next year			0
it weighs roughly one metric ton and is about the size of a small automobile .			0

@entity60 team to be locked up in a windowless capsule for about a year and a half
six men to be in cramped , claustrophobic conditions in a special facility in @entity22
they *'ll* talk to mission control via internet , do tasks similar to space station astronauts
organizers hope project will shed light on psychological , physical effects of @entity6 mission
