because we have to be impartial			0
but also , we want to warn the other parties			0
no one can commit crimes in @entity4			1
" @entity1 emphasized it was the first time the @entity2 was able to respond in real time to allegations , partially due to social - networking sites such as @entity82			1

" we identified some individuals with a factor of formal authority who have authority on the security forces who allegedly committed the crimes , " he told reporters			2
" they are @entity110 , his inner circle including some of his sons who have a facto authority , but also there are some people with formal authority that should pay attention to the crimes committed by their people because if they are not preventing stopping and punishing these crimes they could be responsible in accordance with the law			2
