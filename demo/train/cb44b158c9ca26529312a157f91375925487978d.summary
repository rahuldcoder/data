-- it 's a cliche of @entity3 presidential politics -- the president we elect is always a reaction to what came before			1
as in : nixonian shenanigans eventually gave rise to @entity11 's self - righteousness			2
clintonesque parsing gave way to @entity15 's plain speaking			0
@entity15 's plain speaking begat @entity18 's lofty speechifying			0
and so we head into 2016 ( yes , already ) and @entity21 's ready - made narrative : if @entity18 is lofty , @entity21 is down to earth			1
if @entity18 was n't tough enough , he 's hard - hitting			0
if @entity18 could n't run his complex health care rollout , he 's a strong manager			1
if @entity18 was partisan , he 's worked across party lines			0
in sum : @entity21 can lead in the precise ways that @entity18 disappointed			1
until a traffic jam on the @entity28			1
then came another stark contrast : the vindictive -- and more important , petty -- @entity21 culture as opposed to the stature the presidency demands			1
so far , the @entity35 melodrama looks like the worst side of the @entity21 ethos			1
the apparent reprisals against @entity40 mayors			0
the vanity of featuring the @entity21 family in taxpayer - funded commercials			1
the environment in which retribution reigned when @entity21 did not get what he wanted			1
the arrogance of believing he was deserving of it all , and to hell with the rest of ' em. the grand storyline behind all of this , of course , is the design on the presidency : @entity21 wanted to be re-elected by such an overwhelming margin that it would launch his national aspirations into the stratosphere			1
the plan was to get bipartisan support to show his viability as a national candidate			2
all who stood in the way were official enemies			2
this is not to say that presidents do n't have enemies			2
you do n't get elected to any office in this country , much less president of the @entity3 , without accumulating political enemies			2
but the real question is why you consider someone an enemy , and then , how you deal with it			2
as president , @entity84 had always had a bunch , but the enmity -- and payback -- generally came over issues , not self - aggrandizement			0
it 's @entity92 : if you want to pass a civil rights bill and you do n't get a " yes " vote from an opponent who wants a bridge in his state , no bridge			0
that 's very different from saying if you do n't endorse my candidacy i will shut down your bridge			0
that 's not politics ; it 's puny payback			0
and , worse , the impact is felt not only by the opponent , but by his -- and your -- constituents			0
a bridge way too far			0
then consider @entity112 , who had plenty of enemies			2
a former senior @entity112 adviser reminds me that " it became a joke that the best thing to be was @entity112 's enemy			0
if 99 people in a room were for him , and one was against him , he would spend all his time trying to persuade that one guy he was wrong			0
and he was always willing to argue the substance			0
in fact , he enjoyed it			0
" this is not to turn @entity112 and @entity84 into saintly role models and @entity21 into the devil			1
but it is to say that @entity21 's staff shenanigans -- which he says he did not know about -- have raised enormous questions about his temperament and how he would run a @entity137			1
in fact , a @entity139 poll released this week shows that only 44 % of @entity35 voters believe that their governor has the right temperament for the @entity144			2
the characterization of @entity21 and @entity18 as opposite numbers is accurate in many ways			1
there 's this : when then - sen. @entity151 , the @entity152 - turned - independent , endorsed @entity153 sen. @entity153 for the presidency in 2008 -- and became his outspoken travel buddy -- there were calls for retribution after @entity18 won			0
so what did @entity18 do ? he kept @entity151 on as chairman of an important committee			0
it kept an enemy close , not a bad strategy			0
@entity18 is cool and @entity21 is all drama			1
and now a line of argument against him as petty and vindictive has been opened up that will become the default narrative			2
but @entity21 will be defined as much by how he deals with this episode as the episode itself			1
no one expects -- or really wants -- @entity21 to morph into a false version of himself			1
but how about some elevation -- and some perspective -- that flies way above the traffic jam on the @entity28 ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity181 .			1

@entity181 : on paper , @entity21 seemed a strong candidate for 2016
she says @entity28 *scandal* raises questions about his temperament
every major politician has enemies , but issue is how you deal with them , she says
@entity181 : if @entity21 is *perceived* as vindictive , that *weakens* his claim to presidential *caliber*
