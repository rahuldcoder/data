@entity0 -- oh , @entity2 or @entity3 , where are you , great writers of deep - sea monsters ? for the second time this week , @entity8 has seen a rare sea beast washed ashore , far from home waters			1
this time , it 's a saber - toothed whale , better known to live in deep @entity14 waters than in the warm surf of tourist - choked @entity16 in @entity0 where it stranded wednesday			1
in an extraordinary way even for scientists , the carcass of the nearly 15 - foot and 2,000 - pound whale was intact -- except for a couple of fresh bite marks from sharks			1
the whale , a female , apparently was barely alive when it came ashore -- a highly unusual sight because beached whales are often badly decomposed or badly eaten by marine life , a local biologist said			2
" it was really humbling and sad to see such a majestic creature stranded this way , " said @entity31 , director of the @entity32			0
she rushed down the beach on her bicycle to witness the rarely - seen animal after staff naturalist @entity38 happened upon a crowd surrounding the whale on the sand			2
such a sighting of the whale up close in @entity8 " is a once in a lifetime opportunity , " she added			2
giant eyeball washes up on beach just three days earlier , another rarely observed species -- a sea - serpent - like animal called an oarfish -- was discovered dead at @entity51 off the @entity0 coast			1
oarfish hide in the deep ocean			2
the one found in the island 's @entity56 was so big -- 18 feet long -- that it required 15 people to hold it chest - high in a trophy photo taken by the @entity62			1
" they 're so rare and unusual looking , " @entity63 of the @entity64 of @entity0 said of the oarfish and the saber - toothed whale			1
" they are like sea monsters , and people really pick up on that			0
" are their deaths freak events prompted by global warming ? " i think it 's just really a coincidence , " @entity63 said			1
" it 's too early to tell			0
if we were to see a whole bunch of these animal strandings , that would give more evidence of something going on			0
" added marine biologist @entity84 of the @entity32 : " i 'm not going to speculate on any wackiness , but i will say you have years of temperature changes and we have had warmer waters ...			0
i 'm not saying the water temperature brought that whale or the oarfish here , but it 's still a pretty amazing sight to see			2
" dine is also a mammalogist who performed a necropsy on the whale shortly after it was found wednesday			2
his examination showed no signs of trauma such as being hit by a ship and no signs of disease or parasites , @entity96 said			0
the female whale also did n't have any food in her stomach -- aside from ingested plastic or nylon that was n't enough to kill her , @entity96 said			2
the carcass did show two or three fresh wounds from cookie - cutter sharks , whose name comes from how their bites leave a round wound that cuts through skin , blubber and muscle , @entity63 said			2
but those bites were n't mortal wounds , he said			0
in fact , the whale had several dozen scars from such bites , which are common in the species , he added			0
@entity63 is waiting on testing results of tissue samples to determine a cause of death			0
though the animal 's death is unfortunate , scientists such as @entity63 are excited about its discovery because so little is known about the deep - water animal that lives in the @entity136			1
its strandings typically occur in @entity14 or @entity139			1
its last stranding in southern @entity8 was 15 years ago , @entity63 said			0
" there is some speculation that they do migrate in the winter , but it 's not certain how far ( south ) they go , " @entity63 said			0
it 's the adult male whale that grows sabertooth - like teeth , used for combat against other males for dominance in breeding , @entity63 said			2
the females do n't grow the saberteeth			0
the species is also known as the @entity159 's beaked whale			0
as a whole , the front of the species ' face resembles a goose beak , @entity63 said			0
" it 's creating a lot of excitement in the media and the public , but the scientists are just as excited about this because it 's a rare opportunity to study the natural history of these kinds of animals that are so rarely observed , even by marine specialists , " @entity63 said			1
@entity177 makes a splash : the rarest whale though the plastic found in the whale 's stomach did n't cause its death , the material 's presence in marine life is a growing concern			1
" certainly , pollution of plastics in the ocean is a huge concern and causes i do n't know the number of deaths of marine animals , " @entity63 said			0
the discovery of the two animals also occured as @entity200 paddle - boarder @entity198 captured on his helmet camera a video of an 8 - foot great white shark swimming underneath him and grazing his board this week			1
the series of events has heightened public interest in what lurks within @entity0 ' coastal waters , scientists said in interviews thursday			1
what now becomes of the two magnificent sea monsters ? @entity215 took several tissue samples of the whale , and its skeleton will be placed in the museum 's collection of 4,000 marine specimens , used for research and exhibition , he said			0
the 15 - foot - long whale is just a little bit short of the 18 feet common for females in the species			1
as for the oarfish , its 18 - foot length was too big for one freezer , so scientists cut it up into small pieces and froze them , said @entity237 , program director of @entity62			1
researchers will later boil off the flesh and reconstruct the skeleton , using photographs taken during the dissection of the deep - sea serpent			1
study : spiders had ancient big - clawed relatives @entity1 's @entity247 , @entity248 and @entity249 contributed to this report .			0

a saber - toothed whale from the @entity14 deep sea washes ashore in @entity0
its carcass is intact , giving tourists at @entity16 and scientists a rare sighting
earlier this week , a rare oarfish that was 18 feet long is found at a coastal island
scientists ca n't say whether the rare animals ' strandings are because of global warming
