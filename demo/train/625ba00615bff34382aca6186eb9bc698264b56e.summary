the boy said he deleted the video the next morning when he realized it was wrong			1
defense lawyers tried to dismantle what prosecutors said was the central argument in the case -- whether the girl was too drunk to understand what was happening to her			1
the defense challenged whether all three witnesses were reconstructing events from memory or from the text messages and cell phone images			1

all three initially attempted to invoke the @entity125 against self - incrimination			0
teen rape trial shines unwelcome spotlight on @entity0 town the testimony came a day after prosecutors presented text messages they said were between @entity18 and various people , and the alleged victim			2

in one message she asks what happened " last night			0
" " and do n't lie about anything			0

@entity156 ( i do n't know ) what to say , " the message said , according to @entity151 , a computer forensic investigator with the @entity152 , who read the messages to the court on thursday			0

in others , he says the girl performed a sex act on him			2
one message asked @entity18 : " did u do it ? " he responded , according to @entity151 : " no , lol			0
