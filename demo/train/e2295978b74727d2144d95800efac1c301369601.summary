@entity0 -- it wo n't be your imagination if the moon looks bigger and brighter friday night , like " a cosmic flood lamp			1
" @entity7 says the moon will appear up to 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter			1
every few years , a full moon coincides with the point in the satellite 's elliptical orbit that brings it closest to the center of the @entity14			2
friday night , the moon will be fully illuminated just four hours after reaching that point , according to a feature story on the @entity7 's web site			1
the moon will appear up to 14 percent larger and 30 percent brighter than " lesser full moons we 've seen earlier in 2008 , " @entity7 says -- provided it is being viewed in a clear sky			1
at the moon 's closest approach -- the orbital perigee -- it is about 30,000 miles ( 48,000 kilometers ) closer to @entity14 than at the other extreme -- the apogee -- the space agency says			1
the full moon , as always , will seem largest when it is near the horizon , as it rises and sets , " but it 's really just an optical illusion , " said @entity7 spokesman @entity33			1
when the moon shines directly overhead , he said , it 's hard to tell the difference in size			0
on its web site , @entity7 notes that " for reasons not fully understood by astronomers or psychologists , low - hanging moons look unnaturally large when they beam through trees , buildings and other foreground objects			0
" " if you go outside around midnight , " @entity7 says , the moon " will be close to overhead and act like a cosmic flood lamp			1
" as the moon goes through its orbit every month , the distance from its center to the center of the @entity14 averages about 239,000 miles ( 384,600 kilometers )			2
friday evening the distance will be about 222,000 miles ( 357,300 kilometers )			0
an alignment of the full moon and the orbital perigee occurs at most once in 1Â½ years , and @entity33 says this year 's phenomena should n't be much different from previous ones			0
the moon 's brightness always varies with its distance from @entity14 , but having the full face of the moon illuminated emphasizes that variation			2
the close approach of the moon and having the moon , @entity14 and @entity72 lined up -- as happens twice a month -- bring higher - than - normal ocean tides , so it is no surprise that having both at once means even higher tides			0
the @entity76 says the difference will be minimal			0
in most places the tide will be just an inch or so ( a few centimeters ) higher than normal " spring " tides , those that come with the new or full moon			0
some locations might see a difference of up to 6 inches ( 15 centimeters ) , it says .			0

@entity88 will look bigger , brighter friday because it is closer to @entity14
@entity7 says moon will seem largest when it is near the horizon
around midnight , @entity7 says , moon will look like " a cosmic flood lamp "
