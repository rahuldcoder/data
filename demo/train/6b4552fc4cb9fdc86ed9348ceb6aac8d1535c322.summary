-- @entity1 became the largest @entity3 city to exit bankruptcy this week , with the effective approval of a plan to slash $ 7 billion in debt and reinvest $ 1.4 billion to improve city services			1
the move set in motion the " @entity11 , " an $ 816 million deal that ensured the bankruptcy 's timely and fair resolution , by helping to honor city retirees and preserve the @entity16			1
retired public employees and artwork -- two civic assets rarely thought of in the same breath			2
but in @entity1 -- and , indeed , in countless cities across the country -- the duo constitute an essential part of the city soul			1
take @entity27 's @entity26 , a work as iconic as any on display in the @entity30			0
the murals personify the spirit of @entity1 , where citizens of varying backgrounds came together to build the city with their own hands			1
it is this spirit of hard work and determination that made @entity1 an envy of the world -- and that persists in communities throughout the region today			1
for much of the last 18 months , though , the pensions of tens of thousands of @entity1 's retirees , along with the world - class art collection at the @entity30 , were put at risk in @entity1 's bankruptcy			1
as the museum and retirees led the news , the focus was not the enduring spirit of the murals , nor the toil of @entity1 's workforce			1
the question , instead , centered on the whether @entity1 needed them at all			2
how much would the city cut from retirees ' pensions plans ? what art could be sold from the @entity30 ? at the @entity66 , a philanthropy rooted in @entity1 and committed to expanding opportunity in cities nationwide , we fundamentally rejected this way of thinking			1
we refused to stand by while pensioners were dealt a devastating blow to their livelihoods			0
we could n't keep quiet as assets of one of our community 's greatest treasures were stripped			0
so we -- along with dozens of partners across the private , public and philanthropic sectors -- contributed to the @entity80			0
in doing so , we affirmed our commitment not only to @entity1 's future , but to an even grander bargain : the notion that government and the citizens it represents can join together in pursuit of the common good			1
this social compact , and the set of values it embodies , must be embraced as cities look to succeed in the 21st century			0
with @entity1 's bankruptcy now behind us , it 's time to step back and reflect			1
why did so many put so much money into art and pensions ? and what can we take from this chapter in one of @entity3 's greatest cities ? first , the @entity11 is a study in collaboration between diverse -- and even unexpected -- stakeholders			1
when our group of foundations first announced this investment in january , we hoped our involvement would bolster the spirit of positive engagement and creativity in @entity1 , encouraging others to invest strategically across the region			2
local and national philanthropies , retirees and unions , elected officials on both sides of the aisle and from all corners of @entity124 , businesses from the " @entity127 " automakers to @entity128 , cultural advocates , a groundswell of @entity1 residents -- all came together to forge this compromise , underscoring that no one entity , or sector , can do it alone			2
in an age of budget constraints and political polarization , cooperation is not only possible , but indeed critical to solving our most pressing urban problems			0
second , this deal highlights the need to move beyond accepted ways of thinking â € ” to reject the status quo , particularly when it is shrouded in pessimism			0
it 's one thing to pay lip service to @entity1 's most vulnerable residents and a vital civic asset			1
it 's entirely another to develop a legal framework and garner the support necessary to do so			0
revitalizing @entity3 cities will require the same nimbleness , innovation and risk - taking that were on display in @entity1			2
it will require real risk -- of resources and reputation			0
third , our investment says something about the values we , as foundations , think are essential to prosperity and inclusion			0
shoring up pension funds helps families , bolsters the local economy and relieves pressure on municipal operating budgets			0
treasured cultural beacons like the @entity30 strengthen metropolitan areas , attract residents and visitors alike , and add to citizens ' connection to the city			0
and in @entity1 , supporting the dignity of retired city employees and preserving the art were , above all else , essential to hastening the city 's bankruptcy and putting it back in the starting blocks			1
there 's no doubt that @entity1 's emergence from bankruptcy has been hard			1
we faced tough questions about the accountability of non-elected decision - makers ; and about the feasibility of improving @entity1 's public services , remediating blight and rebuilding the tax base			1
retirees who negotiated in good faith still face pain and hardship			0
the road ahead will be challenging , as institutions need rebuilding , communities need repairing , and the trust of citizens needs restoring			0
but it is the positive characteristics of the @entity11 that form the basis of @entity1 's future -- and that serve as inspiration for other cities to tackle similar , seemingly insurmountable challenges			1
resilience and hope triumphed in @entity1			2
all strands of our community joined to weave a fabric of possibility that will forever change this city			0
there have been times over this last year when our aspirations to get back to work seemed beyond reach			0
but the stakes were too high to fail ; there was simply too much potential to give up			0
in @entity1 , each person , institution , and community rose to the challenge			2
it 's time to do that once again -- not just in the @entity1 , but across the nation			2
if there 's a lesson from @entity1 's bankruptcy , it is that			1
we can , and we will , protect our cities .			0
