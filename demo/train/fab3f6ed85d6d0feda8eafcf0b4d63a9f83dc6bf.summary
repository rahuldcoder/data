@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 defended on friday its practice of caning criminals after a disturbing video of a prison - yard caning session burst onto the @entity7 , reigniting criticism from lawyers and human rights advocates			1
in the video , a naked man is shown strapped to an upright wooden frame , his rear exposed to a uniformed official who lifts a meter - long rattan stick above his head before bringing it down on the prisoner 's buttocks , tearing the flesh with each strike			1
the video , in which the moaning and shaking prisoner is struck six times , has spread quickly across the @entity7 , capturing headlines in the web sites of some @entity30 newspapers and forcing the @entity1 government on to the defensive			1
" the government at this stage has no plans to abolish the cane as part of punishment , " deputy internal security minister @entity33 told @entity2 by telephone			0
he said the video was an official recording that had been leaked onto the @entity7			0
the video had been produced for deterrent purposes , with excerpts shown during anti-narcotic education sessions to would - be drug dealers , he added			2
" this video was taken officially by us for a demonstration purpose , but it is not supposed to have the victim 's face identified			2
somehow somebody must have taped ( copied ) it			0
" @entity1 is not alone in caning criminals , which critics say breaches human rights norms , including the @entity56			1
neighboring @entity57 also wields the rattan stick and caused a @entity60 outcry 13 years ago when it caned an @entity60 teenager , @entity61 , four times for vandalism			1
but @entity1 's @entity64 , which represents about 12,000 lawyers , recently called for a ban on caning , saying the " cruel " practice was rising in @entity1 , especially on illegal immigrants after hasty hearings arranged at crammed detention centers			1
" they have started imposing the caning sentence in a more rigorous way and it can affect anyone who comes in ( to @entity1 ) without a passport or papers , so it happens to asylum - seekers and refugees , " said @entity72 , of the council 's @entity73			1
the government denied use of the cane was widespread against illegal immigrants and deputy internal security minister @entity33 said it was reserved mainly for the traffickers of illegal immigrants in addition to drug - traffickers and violent criminals			2
@entity33 said the government also faced calls from victims of crime for the use of the cane to be maintained or even increased for some serious crimes " in view of the crime rate in @entity1 "			0
crime is seen as a major electoral issue in the run - up to a possible early general election , expected early next year			0
" we respect the view of the @entity64 but there are many other views from the people and also from the victims of crimes that there should be an increase ( in caning ) , " @entity33 said			0
