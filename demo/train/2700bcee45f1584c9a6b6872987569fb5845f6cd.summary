-- his was a suicide with a macabre twist			0
in february , former @entity4 safety @entity3 shot himself in the chest , but not before leaving behind a note requesting that his brain be studied for evidence of a disease striking football players			1
the plaintive note read , " please , see that my brain is given to the @entity14 's brain bank			1
" scientists announced monday that @entity3 's brain tissue showed " moderately advanced " evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a dementia - like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma			1
" @entity3 had classic pathology of cte and no evidence of any other disease , " said dr. @entity22 , a neuropathologist with the @entity25 medical center , and co-director of the @entity27 for the @entity28			1
" he had severe involvement of areas that control judgment , inhibition , impulse control , mood and memory			0
" @entity30 has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former @entity14 players thus far studied at the @entity27 center			2
their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions , sub-concussive blows to the head , or both			2
the picture beginning to emerge from these cases is that that trauma could be causing brain damage			1
a brain with @entity30 is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau			2
under a microscope , tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia			0
but the cases of @entity30 have shown this progressive , dementia - like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis , which typically occurs when people are in their 70s or 80s			0
@entity68 , an offensive lineman with the @entity69 and also diagnosed posthumously with @entity30 , was 50 when he died			0
@entity70 , a nine - year @entity14 veteran who played most of his career with the @entity72 was 45 , and @entity3 was 50			1
scientists at @entity27 have found evidence of @entity30 in the brain of an athlete as young as 18			2
" to see the kind of changes we 're seeing in 45 - year - olds is basically unheard of , " @entity22 said in an earlier interview with @entity0			0
@entity3 suffered a minimum of 10 known concussions during the course of his career , some of them involving loss of consciousness , said dr. @entity89 , co-director of the @entity27 center			1
symptoms that nagged @entity3 after he retired from the @entity14 in 1993 were typical of cases such as @entity68 and @entity70 , including problems with impulse control , an increasingly short fuse and headaches			1
@entity3 's ex-wife said that while playing professionally , the head trauma he bore on the field would become plain after games ended			1
" sometimes he would come home with extreme headaches , " said @entity101 during an interview with @entity0 in february			2
" we would meet after the game and he would want me to drive because he felt dizziness or he just did n't feel stable			0
" @entity101 said that several years before he died , her husband had been extremely bright , articulate , gifted			0
but as time wore on , he began to lose those faculties			0
@entity3 began to have trouble forming coherent sentences and spelling			1
alongside cognitive and emotional problems , a business that he established after his @entity14 career began failing			0
the tragic culmination of his problems was his suicide on february 17			2
" we do seem to be seeing an increased rate in athletes who have early and moderate stage @entity30 , " said @entity22 , adding the caveat that the @entity27 sample is autopsy - based and therefore inherently biased			0
@entity3 's death , and specifically the decision to shoot himself in the chest , apparently to avoid damaging his brain tissue , shocked members of his family and the football community			1
@entity3 's case is the first in the @entity30 narrative in which a player ostensibly took his own life to have his brain studied			1
" it 's important for people to understand that it does not help our research or our mission of the @entity145 to take their own lives because they fear they have this disease , " said @entity89			0
" the future will lead to successful treatment of this disease			0
" @entity3 's son @entity150 said that the analysis of his father 's brain -- the answers to questions about death -- has given the family a measure of closure			1
" it is my greatest hope that his death will not be in vain and that through this research his legacy will live on and others wo n't have to suffer in this manner , " @entity160 said .			0
