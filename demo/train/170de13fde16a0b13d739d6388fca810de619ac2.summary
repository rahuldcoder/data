-- " we will restore science to its rightful place			2
" when those words came out of president @entity6 's mouth during his inaugural speech , public health nerds such as myself rejoiced heartily			1
we believe that policy , especially health policy , should be based on scientific evidence			1
funny , then , that we ignore this important piece of evidence : when scientific facts go up against moral ideologies , ideology usually wins			1
i 've worked for more than a decade in the field of hiv prevention			0
that means working with sex and drugs -- two areas where there is no shortage of good science , and an abundance of ideology			1
the science tells us , for example , that making clean needles universally available to drug injectors can more or less wipe out @entity20 transmission in this group			1
the ideology tells us that providing such services for injectors is tantamount to condoning an illegal behavior that wrecks lives and families and increases crime			2
if you were running for election , faced with the choice of paying for clean needles and health services for injectors or with putting more cops on the streets and cells in the jails , which do you think would play best with the voters ? read more about @entity54 at @entity55 @entity20 has taught us something about the nature of democracy as well as the more personal decision - making that my ted talk addresses			1
the fact is that many of the most effective public health policies have been put in place by governments that @entity67 think of as ideological , even undemocratic			2
@entity68 has one of the world 's better prevention programs inside its jails , and sterile needles are available to injectors from dispensing machines around @entity76			1
the @entity77 gives clean needles to prisoners			1
@entity80 makes needles available to injectors through pharmacies at subsidized prices			2
these countries are not exactly synonymous with liberalism			0
government officials can afford to do nice things for junkies because they do n't need to worry much about what might happen in midterm elections			0
and they need to be pragmatic because they expect to be in power for some time			0
better to put in place prevention programs that deal with a distasteful headache now than to deal with a much greater headache in the future			0
that 's harder to do in a democracy ; if you do something upsetting to the majority of voters now , you wo n't be around to reap the benefits of your far - sighted action in the future			2
it 's hardly surprising , then , that for the last 20 years , the @entity107 put politically popular ideology ahead of science , denying federal funding for needle exchanges			1
( @entity107 repealed the ban last year			0
) at the local level , though , things often look different			0
many cities , realizing that they would have to pick up the pieces of the nation 's failed war on drugs , have scraped out their pockets and provided services to injectors			0
the result has been a huge decline in new hiv infections among drug users and their sex partners ; the burden on the health system has of course fallen , too			1
and there is no evidence at all that these programs have led to a rise in injecting -- a specter commonly raised by the ideologues			0
the truth is , people who 've never injected drugs in their life do n't suddenly say : " oh look , a clean needle dispenser			0
maybe i 'll try shooting up heroin			0
" this disconnect between national and local policies is instructive about the way democracy works			0
at a national level , politicians seem to respond to what they think the electorate wants to hear			0
at the local level , however , they are more likely to respond to what the electorate really needs -- workable solutions to real problems			2
the only workable solutions are the ones that are based on good , solid , scientific evidence			1
in my little corner of public health , the @entity6 administration is following through on its promise to put the science back into policy			1
since the ban on federal funding for safe injecting programs was dropped in december , the sky has not fallen , and if the government falls , it certainly wo n't be because of this small piece of pragmatism			0
but two decades of banging the " evidence - based " drum does make me think that we scientists need to learn from the evidence			1
scientifically sound solutions can only be implemented where they can be made politically workable			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity54 .			2

@entity54 says @entity6 's embrace of science in setting health policy is *encouraging*
but political and moral ideology , she says , often wars with science - based policy
data show that giving drug users clean needles stalls @entity20 's *spread* , she says
@entity54 : science - based solutions must be made politically workable to be implemented
