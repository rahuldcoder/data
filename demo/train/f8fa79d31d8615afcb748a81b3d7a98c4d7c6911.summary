@entity0 -- it 's a daunting assignment for an @entity4 combat brigade at @entity5 , @entity6 -- get all the military 's high - tech software , uplinks , phones , drones and computers to talk to each other			1
the goal of the @entity4 is to fine - tune a global network to provide everyone , from commanders to frontline soldiers , the same information , quickly and seamlessly			1
" the network will literally redefine how we fight in the same way that social media has changed the way we interact and communicate in our personal lives , " army vice chief of staff gen. @entity20 said monday			0
" the network will change how we operate on the battlefield			1
" @entity20 said that over 10 years of war in @entity30 and @entity31 , new equipment had been raced to the battlefield , some of it off the shelf			0
now the task is to synchronize new and old equipment in a battlefield setting in the vast and rough terrain of @entity5			1
that @entity4 installation provides mountainous terrain and desert in an area the size of @entity43			0
the testing by 3,500 to 4,000 members of the combat brigade will be the centerpiece of the @entity4 's modernization program , according to @entity20			1
" it will make our various formations more lethal , faster and more survivable on today 's battlefield , " he said in an hour - long question - and - answer session with journalists at the @entity52			2
already the @entity4 is experimenting with smartphones , finding uses as diverse as monitoring the eye - in - the - sky , real - time video of drones , or transmitting pictures of the wounded to doctors miles away , or calling up biometric details of suspected insurgents stopped at checkpoints			2
traditionally formal @entity4 procurement programs could stretch eight years or longer , finally delivering a product to specifications that might already be years behind current technology			2
now if the @entity4 is able to integrate existing software into its network , then industry can regularly and quickly update the technology			1
" together we must we ensure have the most current technology available so that ultimately we may get it into the hands of our soldiers as quickly as possible , " @entity20 said			0
over time the @entity4 will be able to plan and buy equipment more efficiently			0
" the @entity4 will buy what it needs , when it needs it , for those that need it , " @entity20 said			0
" this allows us to buy less , more often and incrementally improve the network capability over time			0

a combat brigade at the @entity4 's @entity5 is on a technological *mission*
the goal is to fine - tune and synchronize a global network of military technology
