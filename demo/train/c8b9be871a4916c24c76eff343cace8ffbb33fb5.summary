@entity0 , @entity1 -- this is not a movie			1
there 's no dramatic music in the background			2
a happy ending , far from a guarantee			2
the concern in @entity12 's voice was clear as day			2
with two telephones to his ear , he listened to his wife , @entity17 , as she fled into an attic of their @entity0 home			1
with her : her two 9 - year - old children and a loaded .38 revolver			2
in the house : an intruder with a crowbar			1
on another line was the 911 operator @entity12 had called for help			2
@entity12 's words to his wife , as he sat helplessly , an hour away from the home , were recorded			1
" stay in the attic , " he instructed her , calmly			2
" he 's in the bedroom , " she told him			2
he repeated the words to the 911 operator			2
relax , " @entity12 said , trying to calm his wife			2
then he instructed her to do what was fast becoming a realistic possibility			2
" @entity17 -- if he opens up the door , you shoot him ! you understand ? " what happened next has made the @entity44 the new faces of the right to bear arms			1
@entity48 fired a six - shot revolver at the intruder , hitting him five times , in his torso and in his face			1
surprisingly , he managed to flee			2
opinion : the case for gun rights is stronger than you think gun rights groups say this shows that law - abiding citizens should be allowed to buy their weapon of choice and as big a magazine or ammunition clip as they like			1
they remind people that @entity48 had only a six - shot revolver			1
" it 's a good thing she was n't facing more attackers			2
otherwise she would have been in trouble and she would have run out of ammunition , " said @entity70 , director of communications for the @entity71			0
" she shot him five times and he still did n't drop			1
this is going to endanger people 's safety			0
" the right of self - protection has been thrust into the forefront in a national debate after last month 's @entity83 , @entity84 , tragedy			0
this week , a federal task force led by vice president @entity87 is holding talks with private industry groups , the @entity90 , and legislators -- all to determine the correct balance between the right to self - protection and preventing further mass shootings			1
meanwhile , @entity96 are flocking to gun shops to buy guns and ammunition in record numbers -- partly due to @entity83 and partly due to their fears that the rules are about to change on what they can legally own			1
the @entity105 said it conducted almost 2.8 million checks for gun purchases in december , a record high for a month			1
@entity12 and @entity48 own two guns for protection at home , but until two weeks ago , she had never fired a gun			1
her husband told sheriff 's department investigator 's that he took her shooting so that she 'd be familiar with the family 's guns if she ever had to use one			0
now , clutching the .38 revolver , @entity48 was in the middle of a heart - pounding crisis inside her own home			1
she had already locked multiple doors before she and her children took refuge in an adjacent - room attic -- the kind with a small door that you have to bend down to go through			0
the intruder had used the crowbar to break through the front door and then two other doors upstairs , and she could hear him coming closer and closer			1
on the phone , @entity12 calmly instructed his wife about the use of the weapon she had practiced on			0
" remember everything i showed you			0
everything i taught you , " he told her , and he reassured her that help was on the way			0
... shoot him again ! shoot him ! " @entity12 said as the 911 dispatcher listened			1
he then lost phone contact with his wife and children			0
his anguish and the pain of not knowing what had happened may be etched in his mind for eternity			0
he learned later that his wife fired all six shots , and hit the intruder with all but one bullet			1
parents defend right to keep guns in the home not realizing she was out of ammunition , she ordered the man to stay on the floor as he bled			1
she then fled the house with her children			0
@entity173 sheriff @entity172 -- whose office responded to the shooting at the @entity177 ' home -- said he believes the mother and her two children were in a life - and - death situation and she had no choice but to exercise her constitutional right to self - defense			1
" had it not turned out the way that it did , i would possibly be working a triple homicide , not having a clue as to who it is we 're looking for , " he told @entity2			0
despite being shot five times , the suspect , identified as @entity191 , still managed to get back into his suv , but he drove off the road and crashed a short distance away			1
due to privacy laws , the hospital can not divulge any information on his condition			0
home gun ownership and self - defense will always be controversial			1
the @entity44 ' story of self - defense is being used by the @entity90 and the @entity71 to make their point to the @entity206 and @entity207 about gun ownership			1
but @entity12 has told people he 's not interested in being a poster boy for anyone			0
he has not yet responded to @entity2 's request for an interview with him and his wife			0
" my wife is a hero			0
she did what she was supposed to do as a responsible parent and gun owner , " @entity12 told @entity2 affiliate @entity217			1
yet it 's unclear whether the benefits of having a loaded and readily available gun in one 's home outweigh the drawbacks			1
" it 's more common for an armed homeowner in the @entity96 to be a victim of suicide , homicide , assault or an accidental shooting than it is for that person to shoot an intruder , " according to dr. @entity238 , a senior health policy analyst at @entity239 , a non-partisan think tank			1
@entity238 led research for the @entity241 in the 1990s which found that people who have guns in their homes are nearly three times more likely to be a victim of homicide and nearly five times more likely to commit suicide			0
experts also say that simply having a gun for self - protection does not guarantee safety			1
they say the fear is that many people will take part in what might be considered a feeding frenzy by purchasing a gun , but not learn how to properly use it			2
sheriff @entity172 holds courses for homeowners who want to learn how to safely and properly use a weapon			0
" be proficient with it			0
be taught how to use it			0
train with it , " he said			0
" i often tell people , ' if you do n't think that you have what it takes to take a human life then do n't bother buying one			0
do n't waste your money			0
do n't waste your time , " he told @entity2			0
" do n't put it in a drawer and think that 's the answer to everything , because it is n't			0
" @entity2 's @entity279 contributed to this report			0

last week , @entity48 shot an intruder in her @entity1 home
she had learned to shoot only two weeks before
her story has gained the attention of gun rights groups
