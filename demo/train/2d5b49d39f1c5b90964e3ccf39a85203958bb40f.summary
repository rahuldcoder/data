@entity0 , @entity1 -- crews planned to pump nitrogen into a @entity1 coal mine as the search resumed early friday for four miners who may be trapped after a deadly explosion earlier in the week			1
@entity9 of the @entity10 ( @entity10 ) said crews would neutralize potentially explosive air in the @entity14 coal mine with nitrogen , allowing rescuers to go back in and remain there even if an explosive mixture builds again in the air			1
the hope , though slim , is that the four missing miners were able to survive by entering one of the chambers , which were stocked with enough food , water and air to keep 15 miners alive for four days			1
" we committed to the families that we wanted to get into the chambers within 96 hours and we 're trying to everything in our power to do that without taking a chance on the rescue teams , and i think this is the way to do it , " @entity9 said			0
officials said the rescue teams will make " a mad dash " to one of the mine 's two airtight rescue chambers			1
" the rescue teams have taken four breathing apparatuses with them , " @entity9 said			0
" in the best case scenario , we would find four survivors			0
once they get in there , we 'll put oxygen masks on the survivors and bring them out			0
" at least 25 miners died in monday afternoon 's explosion in @entity1 , while four others remain missing and two were injured			1
rescuers -- 32 of them working in four teams -- got within 500 feet of one of the rescue chambers before having to turn back thursday , said @entity59 , chief operating officer of @entity60 , the mine 's owner			1
they were pulled back after it was determined that noxious gas levels were high enough to cause another blast			1
the readings showed potentially explosive levels of methane and hydrogen and high levels of carbon monoxide			0
@entity9 said air samples were tested at regular intervals thursday night and that rising barometric pressure in the wake of a cold front that moved through the region had helped reduce the chances of another blast			2
rescuers had been using high - pressure fans to pull the toxic air through 1,100 - foot holes to the surface thursday			1
one of the four unaccounted - for miners and 18 of the dead were working in an area where longwall cutting was taking place			2
the technique uses a large grinder to extract the coal			0
it creates large amounts of coal dust and methane , both of which are explosive			0
the other three missing miners are believed to be about 2,000 feet away in a new development area of the mine			1
authorities have acknowledged it is unlikely the four missing men are alive , but they refuse to give up hope			0
officials hope to determine whether either rescue chamber has deployed by lowering a camera through the second hole			2
" if they 're deployed , more than likely someone 's in them , " said @entity1 gov. @entity110 said			1
" that means we have a chance of that miracle			0
" but he added : " if they 're not deployed , we know that our chances are diminished tremendously			0
" in an interview with @entity2 , @entity110 noted that the mine was outfitted with gas sensors to alert mine personnel when levels become danger			2
" in gaseous mines , you want to monitor and you want to have good ventilation , " he said			0
" if that has worked before , whenever the levels got out of control they pulled them out and stopped , why did it not happen this time ? " the cause of the explosion is unknown , and state and federal officials have pledged a full investigation			1
the @entity140 announced thursday that president @entity141 will meet next week with secretary of labor @entity142 and an @entity10 official to hear their initial assessment of the cause of the blast and their recommendations on steps the federal government should take to improve safety			2
@entity2 's @entity153 and @entity154 contributed to this report .			0
