@entity0 , @entity1 -- the first caller to reach 911 reported -- in a calm voice that gave no hint to the calamity that awaited -- " a bridge down over the river			1
" hours after wednesday 's collapse , rescuers searched for victims in crumpled cars			2
four minutes later , just before 7 p.m. wednesday , sgt. @entity13 , 55 , and two fellow police officers were among the first to arrive at the south side of the @entity17 bridge that rose 60 feet above the @entity18			1
" i do n't think anybody quite expected the scene we encountered , " he said at a news conference featuring first responders			0
" it was utter chaos at that time -- bridge smoking , dust in the air			1
... we knew it was a bad , very bad situation			0
" the trio wasted no time			1
they split up , leaving one officer on the road to direct arriving first responders while @entity13 and a fellow officer ditched their gunbelts and their radios and clambered aboard a span of the bridge that had tumbled to the river , carrying a still - undetermined number of vehicles and people with it			1
with some people still in their cars , some on the fallen bridge span and some in the water , the men sprang into action			2
" you forget about everything else , " said @entity13 , a former soldier who has been a police officer for 25 years , 20 of them with the @entity55			1
" you understand that you have a job to do and it 's time to get down to business and do that job			1
" the first vehicle they came across was submerged and crushed , he said			0
" we asked a man if he saw anybody get out of that vehicle , and he said , ' that was me , ' " @entity13 said			1
as the officers crawled on a beam , the span " seemed to shift , " and they could hear rivets popping amid victims ' cries for help , @entity13 said			1
" we were forced to make a decision : do we stand back and watch , or do we take action ? " he said			0
" it 's not a place that i would care to go again , but you take a calculated risk and you do your job			1
" within a few minutes , fire and rescue officers were helping the men			2
three victims with possible back injuries were placed on boards and carried to safety			0
" basically , we just told them to be calm , " @entity13 said			1
" a couple of girls were somewhat hysterical			0
they could n't understand how they got to that point			0
i just explained to them that they fell			0
they seemed somewhat amazed by that fact			0
" @entity13 said he told them , " it 's not the fall that hurts you -- it 's the sudden stop at the end			1
they found that amusing , and it calmed them down			0
" only after the police officers had made sure everyone was off the span did the impact of the work hit home			1
" when you 're doing it , emotion does n't enter into it , " @entity13 said			1
" you understand fully that these people are depending on you , and you have a job to do			2
and that 's what you do			0
" but , he added , " 12 hours later , you look at the bridge and you go : ' i have n't a clue why i was under that			2
' " much of the rescue work was achieved only after overcoming logistical barriers			0
about 10 minutes after the collapse , @entity131 of the @entity132 was one of the first doctors to arrive at the south side of the wreckage site			2
but , unable to reach victims from there , he crossed to the north side of the site , where he helped other first responders carry people from the water			0
the tough terrain on the riverbank made getting ambulances to the victims tough , so the first responders commandeered pickup trucks to ferry 55 victims from the water 's edge , @entity131 said			2
as @entity13 and @entity131 were toiling , firefighter and diver @entity154 arrived on the north side , where , with just a rope tied around her waist , she dove repeatedly into the water , searching vehicles for possible survivors			1
though such work -- swift - water rescue -- can be extremely dangerous , " you do n't think about it much until afterward , " she said , noting that she focused wednesday on staying away from live wires and " widow makers " -- overhangs that could collapse at any time , killing anyone below			1
but the work went smoothly , aided by years of having participated in disaster drills , said the diver , who has been a member of the @entity173 since 1991			0
" it was not frantic ; it was pretty organized			0
" one of the most difficult parts of the entire operation had nothing to do with rescue work			0
instead , it involved breaking the time - honored tradition shared by many firefighters of shunning the public spotlight			2
" the media part of it is very difficult for us , " @entity184 told reporters , before ending the news conference abruptly			0

sgt. @entity13 , 55 , and two fellow police officers were among first to arrive
@entity13 : " it was utter chaos at that time -- bridge smoking , dust in the air "
@entity13 and another officer *climbed* on top of a piece of broken bridge
" you take a calculated risk and you do your job , " he said
