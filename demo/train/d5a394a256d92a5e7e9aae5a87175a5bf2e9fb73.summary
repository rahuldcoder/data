-- @entity1 has come up with a new explanation for @entity3 in some of its @entity5 airliners			1
part of the explanation is -- well -- kind of out there			2
something called the seat lock plunger mechanism can " get gunked up over time with people spilling sodas , popcorn , coffee or whatever and that can affect that locking mechanism on the ground that locks the seat to the floor , " airline spokeswoman @entity18 said friday			1
11 witty and sage airline ' gunk ' retorts apparently , worn locking pins can get stuck when food and beverages spill onto them , allowing seat rows to come unhinged , she said			1
@entity31 earlier said saddle - shaped clamps installed to hold the seats down were put in backwards			1
while the clamps may have played a role , the soda and snack gunk now seems to be among the culprits , @entity18 said			0
and while that explains what happened to the three @entity31 flights that experienced loose seats , it does n't explain why the problem has affected only @entity31 flights in recent days , or why it 's happened so many times in such a short period			1
how would you save @entity31 ? " my question is , why have n't we seen this before ? " said @entity48 , professor and crash lab director at @entity51 's @entity50 , @entity52 , campus			1
" did the gunk start building up and decide to falter in the planes at the same time ? i kind of doubt that honestly			2
" @entity48 called the airline 's explanation " curious , " adding that it " seemed to be unique to the 757 , and to the ones that they reconfigured			1
" " what would make more sense is if ( the seats ) were improperly installed , " he said			2
besides presumably cleaning out the gunk , @entity18 says @entity31 mechanics are " taking extra steps to ensure that the seats do not dislodge from the track			0
" that includes installing industrial - strength metal ties as a backup , airline spokeswoman @entity72 said			1
later friday afternoon , airline spokeswoman @entity76 said that the company plans to have " all 48 of our @entity83 back in service " by saturday , noting that 42 of its airplanes had already been repaired and that there were will be no disruptions to service			0
" we have identified the issue , and our maintenance teams are securing an @entity88 - approved locking mechanism to ensure no seat can be dislodged , " she said			2
@entity31 insists after these newly installed mechanical ties are in place , no more seats will be dislodged			1
@entity1 fixing seats in 48 757s the problem first surfaced on a september 26 flight from @entity96 , @entity97 , to @entity98 , according to the airline			1
on saturday , three seats came loose shortly after takeoff on a flight from @entity103 to @entity104 that was carrying 175 passengers			1
that plane diverted to @entity108 's @entity107			0
after incidents with airline seats , readers let loose another incident occurred monday on a flight from @entity108 to @entity104 with 154 passengers			1
it returned to @entity107 without further incident			0
while rare , such incidents are not unprecedented			0
in 2008 , according to media accounts , a @entity119 flight had to make an emergency landing when a row of seats came loose on takeoff			2
the @entity126 -- which investigates @entity31 civilian aircraft accidents -- does not track loose - seat incidents , spokesman @entity125 said			1
when asked about gunked seat - track fittings , a @entity130 spokesman said , " we are not seeing what our competitor has described on the same scale by any means			1
" the coffee and snacks suggestion also did n't sit well on @entity138 , an online gathering spot for pilots and airline maintenance crews			0
" must have been ' @entity147 ' blood to dissolve metal , " posted one user , referring to the film with the space monster with acid blood			0
suggestions on the site are rampant that @entity31 's maintenance contractors bore responsibility for the problems			0
@entity31 , however , has said maintenance work was not to blame for the problems			0
vice president @entity156 also dismissed the possibility that the problems could be linked to an ongoing labor dispute			0
last month , a judge threw out @entity31 's contract with its pilots union			0
since then , pilots have staged what the airline calls a slowdown that has caused the number of flights that are delayed and canceled to skyrocket			1
more than 1,000 @entity31 flights have been canceled and 12,000 delayed in the past month alone			0
airline management has blamed the situation on pilots filing what it says are frivolous reports about aircraft problems			0
the pilots union has denied management 's assertion			0
" i really have a difficult time believing that it 's actually sabotage , " @entity156 said			2
@entity1 also filed for chapter 11 bankruptcy protection late last year			2
who still wants to fly @entity31 ? @entity0 's @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 and @entity185 contributed to this report .			0

new : expert @entity48 calls the airline 's explanation " curious "
new : airline says it will install " industrial - strength " metal ties to keep seats in place
@entity1 : seat fittings " get gunked up over time with people spilling "
seats on at least three @entity1 flights became loose recently , *unnerving* passengers
