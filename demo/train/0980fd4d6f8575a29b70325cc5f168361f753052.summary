@entity0 -- i was standing just a few meters from prince @entity4 as he got to his feet			1
his older brother @entity6 was there too			1
but this was @entity4 's show -- a charity mission to @entity10 , the capital of the poverty - stricken @entity11 of @entity12 where the prince had established a charity @entity15 , to aid the country 's vulnerable children			1
it was a mission , back in june 2010 , and one of which the younger prince is rightly proud			2
within seconds of starting his speech , however , @entity4 could n't resist a playful swipe at his older brother			1
yet again , the third in line to the throne , who proudly boasts a healthy mop of red hair , mocked @entity6 's receding hairline			1
it is a running joke -- but this time @entity6 clearly thought it had been cracked once too often			1
he lent back against the wall , raised his eyes skywards in genuine frustration but said nothing			2
prince @entity4 was once again playing for laughs			1
predictably , at his brother 's expense , he got them			2
@entity6 , not for the first time , simply suffered in silence			2
naked @entity4 scandal a watershed moment for @entity45 press that incident sums the pair up perfectly			1
@entity4 is a showman , a natural performer in front of the camera and a microphone			1
he is warm , naughty , an extrovert and has a sense of fun			2
as a result people warm to him			0
like his late mother , @entity57 , @entity57 , he is flawed and that makes him interesting			1
people love his madcap ways and seem able to forgive him when he gets it wrong			0
he has worn a @entity63 uniform , been exposed for taking drugs and boozing and making racist comments			0
yet we forgive him time after time			0
now his naked romp in the sin capital of the world , @entity70 , has heaped further embarrassment on the @entity72			0
but the chances are it will blow over and we will fall in love with this princely rogue again			0
the reason for this maybe rooted in the fact that deep down the @entity45 public -- who after all fund his security and at least part of his lifestyle -- know unless there is a major disaster he wo n't actually get his hands of the @entity89			0
he can have all the fame and wealth , but in truth very little of the responsibility			0
nude @entity95 - how the @entity45 tabloids lost their sting for prince @entity6 , as second in line to the throne , his future is very different and he knows it			1
he can not let his hair down in public -- if the future @entity105 was exposed doing what @entity4 was snapped doing , it would raise serious questions about his suitability to one day be @entity45 's @entity109 , a position gifted to him by birthright			1
when they were boys @entity57 often confided to friends that she thought @entity4 would make a good @entity105			1
@entity114 , she thought , had a better temperament for the top job			0
she even gave him the nickname @entity117 for " @entity119			0
" @entity6 , always shy and less outgoing than @entity4 , was more introspective , weighed down perhaps by expectation			1
it was @entity4 who frustrated his protection officers by crashing royal cars into walls on the private estates and on one occasion wondering off into a public high street with a police radio for the hell of it			2
@entity6 was always more careful , conscious perhaps that it would be his head that would one day wear the @entity89			2
how ' soldier prince ' @entity4 tore up royal rule book but as an adult @entity6 has grown into his role perfectly			1
he fits the bill as a future king perfectly			1
he speaks well , conducts himself with aplomb on and off duty			1
since his marriage to his university sweetheart , @entity146 now @entity143 of @entity144 , if anything he has grown in confidence and composure			0
the pair look every inch a future @entity105 , and the modern monarchy safe in their hands			1
when they go to nightclubs -- which they do -- there is never a hint of louche behavior or scandal			0
they have a few drinks and go home			0
it may be a little dull , maybe even predictable , but it is what is expected of them			0
he is after all a senior royal not a celebrity			0
since his marriage last year , @entity6 has been seen less and less on the clubbing scene , preferring instead to have a quiet night in or dinner at an @entity175 restaurant with his wife			2
this has led to @entity4 saying his brother has become boring			1
but nothing could be further from the truth			0
prince @entity6 helps save girl from drowning @entity6 , may not have served on the frontline like @entity184 pilot @entity4 , but he risks his personal safety every time he pilots his @entity188 helicopter from @entity189 in @entity190			1
he only recently was in charge of a daring rescue of a teenage girl			0
he combines these duties with official tours abroad and does so tirelessly , sometimes completing engagements at a hospital or charity venue after a 24 hour shift on duty			0
@entity4 is clearly a good soldier			2
he served with distinction as a @entity203 commander in @entity204 before an internet leak that he was there forced him to return early from his tour of duty			0
he will no doubt soon be returning there as an @entity184 pilot and again , i have no doubt , serve his country well			0
embarrassing pics could harm a soldier 's career several way perhaps this latest naked controversy will focus his mind			2
perhaps it will force this " @entity220 " prince to grow up and leave his schoolboy antics behind			0
the next time he goes to poke fun at his older , more cautious brother , he might just hold his tongue			2
for surely now is the time for him to wise up and follow prince @entity6 's example			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity229			0

@entity4 is a showman , a natural performer in front of the camera and a microphone
like his mother , @entity57 , he is flawed and that makes him interesting
it 's a very different story for brother @entity6 , second in line to the throne
will perfectly fits bill as future @entity105 - he speaks well and conducts himself with aplomb
