-- international outcry -- and the pleas of a devoted son -- seem to have saved an @entity5 woman from being stoned to death for adultery			1
but while @entity8 has been granted a reprieve , she is not the only woman sentenced to be stoned for adultery in @entity5			1
there have been at least six sentences carried out since 2006 , says @entity14 , an @entity5 expert at @entity15 in @entity16			2
adultery is the only crime that carries such a penalty in @entity5 law , she said			1
only a handful of countries have laws calling for stoning , and @entity5 is the only one that carries out executions that way , @entity15 records suggest			1
that is because @entity30 does n't really want the punishment to be carried out , says @entity32 , an @entity5 - born campaigner against the practice			1
" stoning is not a @entity37 punishment , it is @entity30 jurisprudence			1
it happened later , " says @entity32 , an expert on @entity5 family law at @entity16 's @entity40			1
" the punishment for any kind of sexual relations ( outside of marriage ) in the @entity37 is 100 lashes , " she says			0
stoning is based on sayings from the @entity50 , known collectively as the hadith , says @entity52 , a research fellow at the @entity53 , which describes itself as an " anti-extremist think tank			0
" under the letter of @entity30 law , it 's nearly impossible to prove adultery , he says			1
" how you prove adultery or fornication is to have four male witnesses -- or two women for every male equivalent -- all of them known to be upright , with no questions about their moral character , who witnessed the actual act of intercourse between the male and the female , " he says			1
" basically , in normal life , this is next to impossible , to have four people testify that in the same place , at the same time , they saw the act of penetration , " he argues			0
false testimony can itself be punished with whipping , he says , because " it is such a severe sin			0
" " as you can imagine , if people were following these laws as they are stated , there would be next to no stonings , " he says			0
even if someone confesses to serious sexual impropriety , they should be sent away three times to reconsider their confessions , he says , and only punished if they have admitted it four times , he adds			0
but @entity5 law is different , @entity32 says			1
" in the case of this woman and other cases , the standard is ' the judge 's knowledge , ' " she says -- in other words , whether the judges believe adultery has been committed			2
she sees stoning as a way of putting pressure on women , she says , particularly in provincial areas			0
" so far there have been no sentences of stoning in @entity117 , only in the provinces			0
it happens when the judge has a grudge against the woman , " she argues , although she notes that only the @entity5 @entity124 has full records of how many stonings there have been , and where			2
men , too , can be stoned for adultery in @entity5 , she says			1
the practice was banned under the secularizing @entity5 shahs of the early 20th century , she says , then reinstated after the @entity30 revolution of 1979			1
" after the revolution , one of the first things the clerics wanted to do was put aside the 1920 secular legal code , " which was based on @entity139 law , she explains			0
" in 1982 , the parliament called for @entity30 punishments , " she says			2
there was some resistance from senior clerics , but the founder of the revolution , supreme leader ayatollah @entity145 , intervened to get it passed			0
stoning remained law in the updated 1992 penal code , she says , but in the first draft of a 2007 revision , it was n't there			2
" after the intervention of ( hard - line @entity156 , it was restored , " she says			0
that new legal code has not yet been approved , she says			0
it 's not clear who will win the battle over the code working its way through the system now , she says , but it does include a potentially face - saving way to keep stoning on the books without having to carry it out			2
" there is a provision that , in cases where stoning causes harm to @entity30 , it can be substituted with other punishments , " she says			1
she thinks it 's no accident that people are being stoned these days , amid political unrest in @entity5			1
" it has become a political matter , " she contends			0
" whenever there is a dispute between traditionalists and reformers in the judiciary , " stonings increase			0
" stoning is one of those issues that has really ( been problematic ) for the @entity30 republic because it is not accepted by society , including the judiciary , " she claims			2
but there continue to be stonings , she says , because " like anywhere else , you have hardliners			0
