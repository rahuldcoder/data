three more cemeteries have been vandalized in @entity2 , at a time of heightened sensitivity over religion and terrorist threats			2
the @entity7 announced wednesday that overnight , headstones were damaged in a small @entity10 cemetery in saint - beat in southern @entity2 and swastikas were scrawled in @entity14 cemeteries in @entity15 , in the west , and @entity17 , in central @entity2			1
those three incidents are in addition to the defacing of tombstones in western @entity2 's @entity22 and the desecration of about 250 graves late last week in a @entity14 cemetery in @entity26			1
authorities took five teenagers -- one of whom turned himself in and none of whom have criminal records -- into custody in that incident and charged them with desecration of graves and with organized damage on property for the public benefit , @entity28 prosecutor @entity27 said monday			2
one of the teens denied the attack was anti-semitic , claiming they 'd thought the cemetery was abandoned and did n't notice the graves were @entity14 until after the vandalism began , according to the prosecutor			1
whatever the motive , the @entity26 vandalism spurred strong condemnations from @entity2 officials , with prime minister @entity51 calling it " a vile , anti-semitic act " and interior minister @entity54 vowing , " the @entity2 wo n't allow another act against our values			0
" the incidents come at a time when @entity14 in @entity2 have become targets , most glaringly with last month 's deadly hostage siege at a kosher supermarket in @entity63			1
it 's not just @entity2 , though , as the recent shooting near a synagogue in @entity67 , @entity68 , illustrates			0
this all comes amid a push by groups like @entity72 for its twisted version of @entity74 and against any nonbelievers , with @entity14 and @entity76 being singled out as targets			2
@entity78 have also come under fire			0
after the @entity63 attack on the satirical magazine @entity82 and kosher market siege , numerous mosques in @entity2 were attacked -- with shots fired in some cases and other instances in which a pig 's head was stuck on a prayer room door and messages of hate were sprayed on walls , according to @entity2 media reports			0
@entity0 's @entity94 and @entity95 contributed to this report .			0
