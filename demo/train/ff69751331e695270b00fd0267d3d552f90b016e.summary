a respiratory virus is sending hundreds of children to hospitals throughout the @entity4 and beyond , health officials say			1
the unusually high number of hospitalizations reported could be " just the tip of the iceberg in terms of severe cases , " said @entity11 , a virologist and director of the @entity14 's @entity13			1
twelve states have contacted the @entity14 for assistance in investigating clusters of enterovirus : @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
four -- @entity20 , @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity24 -- have confirmed cases of @entity32 , also known as @entity33			1
what is @entity35 ? at a news briefing monday , the @entity14 confirmed that samples it tested from children who had been hospitalized in @entity25 and in @entity39 , @entity26 , did show signs of the @entity33 virus , meaning there is a possible regional outbreak			1
the @entity24 @entity44 confirmed that @entity33 cases have been identified in @entity24			1
officials are hearing of illnesses across the state , they say , though there is not a firm count of how many people have been infected			1
dr. @entity52 , medical director of infection control at @entity20 , said the hospital sent around 25 samples to the @entity14 from patients with respiratory illness			1
around 75 % were confirmed to be @entity33			1
the hospital has seen a 12 % to 15 % increase in emergency room visits and admissions this month compared with the same time frame last year , she said			1
enteroviruses , which bring on symptoms like a very intense cold , are n't unusual			1
" it 's important to remember that these infections are very common , " said dr. @entity66			2
@entity66 is the assistant surgeon general for the @entity69 and the director of the @entity71			2
when you have a bad summer cold , often what you have is an enterovirus			2
the @entity14 estimates there are 10 to 15 million viral infections each year in the @entity78			0
the season often hits its peak in september			0
this particular type of enterovirus -- @entity84 - @entity83 -- is uncommon but not new			0
it was identified in the 1960s , and there have been fewer than 100 reported cases since that time			2
but it 's possible that the relatively low number of reports might be because @entity33 is hard to identify			1
" it 's one that we do n't know as much about as we would like , " @entity66 said			0
@entity33 was seen last year in the @entity78 and this year in various parts of the world			1
over the years , clusters have been reported in @entity22 , @entity97 , @entity98 and various countries including the @entity100 , @entity101 and the @entity102			0
the reason health officials are concerned this year is that there have been so many hospitalizations			0
" that 's the scary part -- the unpredictability , i think , " @entity52 said			0
what parents should know about @entity84 - @entity83 @entity26 the virus has sent more than 30 children a day to a @entity39 , @entity26 , hospital , where about 15 % of the youngsters were placed in intensive care , officials said			1
in @entity39 , about 475 children were recently treated at @entity118 , and at least 60 of them received intensive hospitalization , spokesman @entity116 said			1
" it 's worse in terms of scope of critically ill children who require intensive care			1
i would call it unprecedented			2
i 've practiced for 30 years in pediatrics , and i 've never seen anything quite like this , " said dr. @entity126 , the hospital 's division director for infectious diseases			2
" we 've had to mobilize other providers , doctors , nurses			0
it 's big , " she said			0
the @entity39 hospital treats 90 % of that area 's ill children			1
staff members noticed an initial spike on august 15 , @entity140 said			0
" it could have taken off right after school started			0
our students start back around august 17 , and i think it blew up at that point , " @entity140 said			0
" our peak appears to be between the 21st and the 30th of august			0
we 've seen some leveling of cases at this point			2
" an analysis by the @entity14 showed at least 30 of the @entity39 children tested positive for @entity33 , according to the @entity26 @entity155 and senior services			1
vaccines for @entity33 are n't currently available , and there is no specific treatment for infections , the @entity26 agency said			1
" many infections will be mild and self - limited , requiring only symptomatic treatment , " it said			0
" some people with several respiratory illness caused by @entity33 may need to be hospitalized and receive intensive supportive therapy			1
" some cases of the virus might contribute to death , but none of the @entity26 cases resulted in death , and no data are available for overall morbidity and mortality from the virus in the @entity78 , the agency said			1
" it 's not usually fatal , thank @entity180 for that , " @entity66 said			0
" but i 'm not sure why it 's infecting so many kids as opposed to so many people			2
" symptoms include coughing , difficulty breathing and rash			0
sometimes they can be accompanied by fever or wheezing			0
the majority of the children who have been hospitalized with the virus , at least on the samples the @entity14 tested , did have asthma to start with			2
the virus made their symptoms worse			2
" we want parents to know that it 's important to make sure your children with asthma are on their medicines and keeping up with their medication routine , " @entity66 said			2
@entity140 said physicians in other @entity4 states reported cases with similar symptoms			2
" the full scope is yet to be known , but it would appear it 's in the @entity4			0
in our community , meticulous hand - washing is not happening			0
it 's just the nature of kids , " @entity140 said			2
@entity20 @entity219 also is seeing a spike in respiratory illnesses resembling the virus , @entity218 affiliate @entity217 said			1
more than 900 children have gone to @entity20 emergency and urgent care locations since august 18 for treatment of severe respiratory illnesses , including enterovirus and viral infections , hospital spokeswoman @entity223 said			1
of those , 86 have been sick enough to be admitted to the @entity233 facility			0
and @entity234 had five children in intensive care and 20 more in the pediatric unit , @entity217 said last week			1
" this is the worst i 've seen in my time here at @entity234 , " dr. @entity238 told the outlet			0
" we 're going to have a pretty busy winter at this institution and throughout the hospitals of @entity219			0
" @entity245 , 13 , was among the children in intensive care at @entity234 after he came down with a cold last weekend and then woke up tuesday night with an asthma attack that could n't be controlled with his medicine albuterol			1
his mother , @entity251 , called 911 when her son 's breathing became shallow , and her son was airlifted to the @entity219 hospital , she told @entity217			2
her son was put on a breathing tube for 24 hours			0
" it was like nothing we 've ever seen , " @entity257 told kusa			0
he was laying on the couch			0
he could n't speak to me			0
he was turning white , and his lips turned blue			0
" we 're having a hard time believing that it really happened , " she added			0
" we 're much better now because he is breathing on his own			0
we 're on the mend			0
" risk of infection in @entity273 , @entity23 , @entity272 saw a 20 % increase in patients with respiratory illnesses last weekend , and dr. @entity277 said patient samples are being tested to determine whether @entity33 is behind the spike , @entity218 affiliate @entity280 rep @entity283 in @entity284 , @entity25 , saw more than 70 children with respiratory issues last weekend , and seven of them were admitted , @entity218 affiliate @entity282 reported			1
the hospital 's dr. @entity289 believes that the same virus that hit @entity39 is causing the rash of illnesses seen at the @entity284 and @entity295 hospitals , which both imposed restrictions this week on children visiting patients , the affiliate said			1
" mostly we 're concerned about them bringing it in to a vulnerable patient			0
we do n't feel that the hospital is more dangerous to any other person at this time , " @entity289 told @entity282			2
like other enteroviruses , @entity33 appears to spread through close contact with infected people , the agency said			1
" unlike the majority of enteroviruses that cause a clinical disease manifesting as a mild upper respiratory illness , febrile rash illness , or neurologic illness ( such as aseptic meningitis and encephalitis ) , @entity33 has been associated almost exclusively with respiratory disease , " the @entity26 health agency said			1
clusters of the virus have struck @entity321 , @entity322 and the @entity78 from 2008 to 2010 , and the infection caused relatively mild to severe illness , with some intensive care and mechanical ventilation , the health agency said			1
to reduce the risk of infection , individuals should wash hands often with soap and water for 20 seconds , especially after changing diapers ; avoid touching eyes , nose and mouth with unwashed hands ; avoid kissing , hugging and sharing cups or eating utensils with people who are sick ; disinfect frequently touched surfaces such as toys and doorknobs ; and stay home when feeling sick , the @entity26 agency said			1
