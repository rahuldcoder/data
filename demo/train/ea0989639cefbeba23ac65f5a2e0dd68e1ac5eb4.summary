much has been said about the @entity2 's outdoor setting this arctic winter			1
but no matter what unfolds at @entity7 's @entity6 , adjacent @entity4 will be fired up to host hordes of visitors			1
if you 've snagged tickets to @entity12 , lucky you			2
maybe you do n't have tickets but will be in town to witness the football frenzy			2
or maybe you hate the sport and can only keep your game face on for so long before you seek refuge in everything else the city offers			2
@entity21 's bizarre story here 's some play - by - play action for fans -- and ideas for nonfans			1
and yes , there are winter festivals and events planned in @entity7 for the big week , but we 're guessing you 'll be spending most of your time exploring @entity4			1
@entity30 : there might not be a dome at the @entity2 , but you can raise the roof at the 15th annual @entity36 - sanctioned @entity35 at @entity37 on january 31 , kicking off @entity2 weekend with headliner @entity38			1
the longest yard : the 50 yard lounge food and wine festival will take over @entity42 , just outside @entity37 , for @entity2 week , with a giant tent , heated roof decks and football - related culinary and sports events			1
football legends such as @entity48 will make appearances			0
all - day passes begin at $ 400			0
@entity51 : @entity52 will be transformed into @entity53 with a free autograph stage , concerts and photo ops with the famed @entity57			0
the blockslong festival , between 33rd and 44th streets , will run from noon to 10 p.m. wednesday to february 1 ; events are free with the exception of a toboggan run for $ 5			0
stop by @entity64 's booth for event and activities info or visit its website			0
football at the @entity70 : even @entity4 's storied museums are getting in on the action			1
check out the @entity70 's " @entity75 " exhibit of vintage football cards			0
oompah and beer : @entity4 has more beer gardens than you can shake a pretzel at , and the @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity83 , is one of the oldest			1
beginning at 4 p.m. on @entity2 , an indoor tailgate party will kick off			1
@entity87 $ 10 pitchers of frothy beer such as @entity89 to wash down schnitzel and knackwurst while cheering on your team			0
sip and tuck : @entity36 personalities and legends will be huddled at the legendary @entity82 , and the hotel 's illustrious @entity97 will be a see - and - be - scene spot to sip a specialty cocktail themed for the two teams by house mixologist @entity102			1
the landmark hotel , which has also had an uptick in reservations from " football widows " throughout the football season at its @entity108 , will offer the " @entity116 " spa package on @entity2 , which includes a manicure and pedicure , massage or facial , makeup refresh and two cocktails			1

lodging at the floating hotel will be available thursday through the morning of february 3			0
blood falls and other natural oddities football schmootball not really into the game ? here are some ideas to intercept the @entity2 events			1
game play : take advantage of a @entity139 2014 two - for - one tickets promotion			2
you can get a free ticket for the price of one at 26 shows such as " @entity146 " and " @entity147			0
" @entity148 : it 's the @entity150 , and the 15th annual @entity151 will kick off at 1 p.m. on @entity2 at @entity153 and @entity154 streets , with colorful floats , dancing lions and dragons and marching bands			1
super bowl : maybe your idea of a super bowl can be found at @entity163 , one of the city 's most popular bowling destinations , with locations in @entity52 and @entity168			0
beyond a shadow of a doubt : february 2 also happens to be @entity171 , and the @entity172 will open early at 6:30 a.m. so that @entity173 , accompanied by a band , can spy on his shadow ( fingers crossed he does n't ) at 7 a.m. kids will want to stick around to have breakfast with @entity173			1
bonus : take the free ferry ride over for mind - bending views of @entity4 's skyline			1
baseball : maybe you do love the @entity2 for one reason and one reason only -- it marks the end of football season , meaning baseball is on deck			2
check out @entity192 , a pub with enough memorabilia to rival @entity195 , including 1,800 autographed balls			0
make no mistake , though , this popular @entity200 bar will undoubtedly be a hot spot for the @entity2 action , too			2
get a bye : there 's no better day to shop than @entity2 ; the stores are practically empty			1
hit up @entity209 ( be a sport and check out the custom @entity36 shop on the fourth floor ) or score a deal at @entity212 ( @entity214 's windows will display 48 designer , haute couture helmets , part of the @entity219 fundraiser )			0
skate around it : twirl figure eights at one of the many outdoor rinks , including @entity225 , @entity226 and the @entity227 at the @entity228			0
