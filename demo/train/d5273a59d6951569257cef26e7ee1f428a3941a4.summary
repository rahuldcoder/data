-- @entity1 's not a contact sport			1
it is not football , where rock - abbed men brutalize each other to get the ball			2
it is not hockey , where a guy on ice skates gets " checked " ( aka whacked ) if he 's got the puck			1
it is n't even basketball , where 7 - foot mastodons give each other a shove on the spine and a thump in the rump , jostling for a few precious feet of space by the hoop			2
no , baseball is not played that way			1
" collisions at home plate			1
" that is what they are called , in the lingo of the game			2
" a collision at the plate			1
" it occurs principally when a man is running at full speed , attempting to score a run for his side			2
if the ball gets there ahead of him , a catcher , shielded by equipment that includes a mask , shin guards and a @entity46 - like protective vest , like a cop from a @entity49 squad , blocks the plate			1
runner smashes into catcher , who must " tag " him with the ball ( and not drop it ) before that runner can step on home plate			1
@entity61 , co-host of @entity62 's " today " morning show , innocently professed her ignorance of baseball on thursday , saying : " i never thought that was a play			1
... i thought it was an accident			2
" no , it is quite deliberate			2
a runner runs as hard as he can into a catcher , becoming a human crash - test dummy			1
unfortunately , there is a side effect			2
somebody stands a chance of getting seriously hurt			2
is this necessary ? is the " collision at home plate " such a key element of a centuries - old sport that the show must go on ? are we a bunch of wusses now , no longer willing or able to play this game in the way that our daddies and granddaddies did ? or are we finally coming to our senses ? @entity1 believes the latter to be true			1
a proposal is being made , to be formally presented to team owners in january , to forever eliminate the " collision " from the baseball vernacular and rulebook			1
no more bowling over the catcher			1
no more trying to " knock the ball out of his hands			2
" no more trying to " knock him into the middle of next week , " to quote some lame 20th century slang			2
from now on , if agreed upon by all , a runner must slide into home plate -- or at the very least try to dodge the catcher and the ball -- rather than plow into him like a steer into a matador			1
concussions are becoming much too commonplace			2
up - to - date medical knowledge is demonstrating how many ex-athletes suffer everlasting degeneration from the impacts of violent incidents on the field of play			0
no matter how much you love the great game of baseball , you could n't possibly believe that it would be less great a game if we no longer make a catcher " stand his ground " and await a blunt - force crash with a fellow human being			1
or could you ? people who follow baseball get their noses out of joint whenever somebody tries to change a rule			1
instant replay would be a big help ? no , it would n't			0
a time clock on the batter or pitcher would speed things up ? nuts to that			0
warnings to both benches and mandatory ejections if a pitcher throws a ball at a batter on purpose ? namby - pamby nonsense			0
do n't fix what ai n't broke ! ( some people say			0
) but come on , this is a good thing , right ? keeping a catcher from getting killed ? or a runner from breaking his neck ? because that 's what " collisions " cause , yes ? serious injury and potentially even death ? how did ex-catcher @entity167 , now the manager of the @entity168 , put it in a @entity171 piece this week ? " i think it 's better to be proactive before we carry a guy off the field paralyzed and think , ' why did n't we change this rule ? ' " amen to that			1
ballplayers current and past understand the danger			0
@entity167 saw his star catcher , @entity181 , severely injured in may 2011 when he was smashed into by @entity182 of the @entity183 ( now @entity184 ) @entity185 , breaking a fibula and being lost for the rest of the year			1
@entity188 , the @entity168 ' general manager , described @entity182 ' actions that day with the word " malicious			0
" but rules are rules , until we change them			0
managers galore are former catchers : @entity167 , @entity202 ( @entity203 ) , @entity204 ( @entity205 ) , @entity206 ( @entity207 ) , @entity208 ( @entity209 ) , @entity210 ( @entity211 ) , @entity195 ( @entity196 's ) , @entity197 ( @entity198 ) , @entity199 ( @entity200 ) , @entity201 ( @entity185 )			1
each of them wore that backstop gear in their playing days			0
each could tell you a story of a violent man - on - man crash			0
many are old enough to have a memory of the most famous baseball collision of all			1
it happened at the 1970 @entity226			0
( yes , a game that did n't even count			0
) @entity228 on second base			0
@entity232 throws the ball to @entity234 , his catcher			1
@entity235 barrels toward home plate			1
he slams into @entity234 like a whale into a fishing boat			1
@entity235 's team wins the game			2
@entity234 , however , is never the same			1
he is seriously injured and supposedly can still feel a twinge of pain from that experience , 43 years later			1
occupational hazard ? ok , maybe			0
no one ever promised a catcher that baseball was going to be a waltz in the park , with nothing but love taps			1
but maybe enough is enough			0
what would it hurt , trying to prevent someone being hurt ? @entity1 rule committee votes to impose rule eliminating home plate collisions i went to a @entity263 vs. @entity265 game on a june night in 1983			1
@entity268 was on first base			0
a fly ball sailed over @entity265 outfielder @entity272 ' head			0
@entity268 had to wait to make sure it was n't caught			0
he then ran full speed , with @entity266 right on his heels			0
@entity268 was tagged out by @entity276 , the catcher			2
the umpire , @entity277 , got in his way , while calling @entity268 out			0
@entity266 smashed into both the catcher and umpire			2
the ball ended up on the ground			0
the ump ended up in the hospital			0
" i was going to run over whoever was in my way , " @entity266 said afterward			0
" i was out if i do n't			0
" the crowd , as they say , went wild			0
runner , catcher and umpire could have been hurt , even paralyzed , from a single play			1
the score at that moment was 6 to 1			0
it was n't a @entity298 , was n't a walk - off game - winning run , was n't a big deal			0
but that 's the way guys like @entity266 were taught to play , giving everything they 've got , risk be damned			2
he was playing to win , period , and by the rules			0
but time for those rules to change			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity314 .			1

baseball becomes contact sport when catcher blocks plate to keep runner from scoring
@entity314 says the collisions at home plate are thrilling and often memorable
but , he asks , is it worth the possible damage to the catcher 's body ?
@entity314 : @entity234 still feels pain from a collision 43 years *ago*
