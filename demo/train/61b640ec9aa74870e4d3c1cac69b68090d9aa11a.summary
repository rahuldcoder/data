@entity0 -- their crime was one of shocking brutality			0
@entity6 and @entity7 first ran down soldier @entity8 in a car , then hacked him to death in a frenzied machete and knife attack			1
confronted with gory closed - circuit tv footage , grueling witness testimony and @entity6 's own defense that he had " no choice " in @entity8 's killing , as he was " a soldier of @entity19 , " the jury took only 90 minutes to convict both defendants of his murder			1
they were cleared of the attempted murder of a police officer			1
but what led @entity6 , 29 , and @entity7 , 22 , both born and raised in @entity26 by families of @entity30 @entity29 origin , to kill on @entity0 's streets in the name of @entity33 ? there seems to be no simple answer to that question			1
@entity6 was the only one to give evidence in court			1
he denied the charges of murder and attempted murder of a police officer , on the grounds that he had acted from religious conviction			1
he converted to @entity33 in 2002 to 2003 , while at a university , and adopted an @entity33 name , @entity8			1
" i am a soldier of @entity19 , " he told the jury			0
" it is a war between @entity33 and those militaries that intervene in @entity51 lands			1
" @entity7 , who did not take the stand , converted to @entity33 more recently , in 2008 to 2009			1
a closer look at their backgrounds reveals that both were already known to police and that both showed earlier signs of radicalization			2
in a news briefing , @entity62 assistant commissioner @entity61 said police had had contact with the two men , as both victims and offenders , over a number of years -- in @entity7 's case for drug offenses , and in @entity6 's case for a handful of incidents involving violent crime			1
both were at a demonstration in 2006 outside the @entity78 in @entity0			0
@entity6 was subsequently convicted on two counts of assaulting a police officer and spent 51 days in prison , but @entity7 was not arrested			1
@entity6 still pleads innocence in that case , denying he punched a female officer in the face and a male officer in the groin			1
both men also participated in a protest in 2012			2
on the witness stand , @entity6 said he attended demonstrations but was not specific , describing them as a way " to let off steam			2
" extremism trigger ' difficult to pinpoint ' he said he had listened to speeches by @entity97 , a controversial @entity26 @entity51 cleric , but did not agree with him			1
" i think he is a good man , however he encourages his followers that jihad in this country is not allowed at this moment , " he said			0
@entity6 said that he had tried to travel to @entity102 in 2010 because he wanted to live under @entity104 law but that he was stopped by @entity106 authorities and returned to the @entity26			1
after that , he reportedly had frequent contact with @entity109 , the @entity26 domestic security agency			2
despite these incidents , what might have pushed them over the edge into violent extremism is " very difficult to pinpoint , " @entity61 said			2
while @entity6 " talks about grievances in foreign policy , " @entity61 said , authorities do n't know where he got his radical views			1
little extremist material was presented to the court as evidence , although materials on " martyrdom " were found in @entity7 's home in @entity127 , southeast @entity0			1
@entity61 , who watched tapes of police interviews with @entity7 , described a " troubled young man " who " was very changeable , emotional and many times very aggressive			1
he did spit at officers and several times this required restraint			0
" there were some indications that @entity7 was associated with a street gang in 2008 , she said			2
@entity6 : ' i was disgusted ' asked in court what he thought of @entity142 , @entity6 said : " i love them and i consider them my brothers in @entity33			1
" @entity6 also told jurors he was against @entity26 foreign policy but did not believe his @entity33 views led him onto the path he had taken			1
" even before i became @entity51 , i did not agree with foreign policy , " he said , then describing an early memory of watching the @entity152 war on television			1
" ' @entity155 ' -- i saw it unfold on @entity157 and @entity1 what not , and i was disgusted , you know			2
it was reported as if it was praiseworthy , " he said			0
" i knew that every one of those bombs was killing someone			0
" @entity6 , who is married with six children , said in his police interview , shown in court , that he did n't like blood			1
he maintained that he posed no threat to civilians , only to the @entity26 military because of its actions overseas			2
he tried to cut @entity8 's head off because it was the proper method under @entity19 , he said			2
" it brings me little joy to approach anybody and slay them			0
can you believe me ? i am not a man who gains enjoyment from watching horror films , " he said			0
his defense lawyer , @entity181 , sought to define @entity6 in his closing argument as a man who was " motivated by a noble idea " rather than being a psychopathic murderer			2
his client was intelligent and totally sincere in his beliefs , and had shown " absolute honesty and moral conviction , " @entity181 said			0
" he did what he did because it was divinely ordained , " he said , adding that he considered @entity6 should have been charged with treason or terrorism rather than murder			2
the defense lawyer for @entity7 , @entity196 , echoed the argument that the men intended to kill a @entity26 soldier because they were soldiers of @entity19 , and that this was not the same as intent to murder			1
the testimony heard in court suggested neither man expected to live after the attack			0
both defendants intended to make police feel threatened because they wanted to be shot , @entity196 said			0
he said a note that @entity6 handed to a bystander at the time of the attack was a joint missive , and it could be regarded as a suicide note , since part of it read " if i live beyond this day			2
... " paramedics who treated @entity6 after he was shot in the arm by police said that he told them : " your government is all wrong			1
i did it for my @entity223			0
i wish the bullets had killed me so i can join my friends and family			0
" this arm belongs to @entity19 , and you can do what you want with it			0
" police : ' it 's a complicated story ' critics may ask why these two men , given that they were known to the police , were not monitored more closely -- and so perhaps prevented from committing @entity8 's murder			1
many in @entity26 will also want to know whether @entity6 and @entity7 were operating alone , and whether a continued threat exists			1
with those questions in mind , the parliamentary @entity239 is reviewing what was known about them before the attack			0
the two men attended mosques across the capital but , @entity61 said , police " are not aware of anyone else being aware of what was going to take place			2
we are not aware of anyone else engaged in the planning of this attack			0
" she said the two men " were in different parts of @entity0 , with different people , exposed to a variety of extremists			0
" she suggested those hoping for all the answers are likely to be disappointed			0
" we may never know the full picture , " she said			0
" i do n't mean to trivialize this , but becoming radicalized is not like becoming pregnant			0
having contact with extremists is a theme			0
but it 's a complicated story			0
" asked about the risk of other " lone wolf " attacks , @entity61 said the @entity62 " have a very good record at stopping attacks , " citing other terror trials held this year			0
" but , sadly , " she said , " our ability to reduce the risk to zero is not there			0
" @entity1 's @entity275 contributed to this report .			0
