@entity0 , @entity1 -- an internet troll reviled for his pornographic posts on @entity6 and recently revealed as a middle - aged software programmer told @entity2 that he made " a huge mistake			1
" for years , 49 - year - old @entity10 hid behind the online screen name " @entity10 , " creating hundreds of subforums on the user - generated website , such as " @entity14 , " " incest , " " pics of @entity17 , " " choke a bitch , " and " @entity19			1
" " @entity10 " has been banned from the site several times , although @entity10 still maintains a separate account			2
last week , @entity23 revealed the identity of " @entity10 , " whose posts generated as many as 800,000 subscribers and triggered a debate about whether @entity6 was criminally liable for the content of its forums			1
@entity6 is a website where the popularity of posts -- and whether they are featured prominently on the site 's main page -- is determined by registered users ' votes			1
days after the @entity23 article , @entity10 agreed to talk exclusively to @entity2 on camera at a hotel room in @entity0 , about six miles from his home			1
he said his employer fired him after the @entity23 article			0
he had worked there for seven years			0
" one of the problems that came around and bit me in the ass was that i did n't really think about what i was doing , " @entity10 told @entity2			1
" and i did n't listen to people when they said , ' you really should n't do this			0
' " @entity10 -- who is married , with a stepdaughter as well as a son and a stepson who are both in the @entity57 military -- told @entity2 he started out posting " mostly soft - core porn , " such as " pictures of naked girls , that sort of thing			1
" " and as i 'd find porn of different types , like if it was a picture of an @entity66 - @entity57 woman , i created a @entity6 called ' @entity67 , ' " @entity10 said			1
" if it was , you know , a woman with large breasts , i created a @entity6 called ' boobies			2
' " years ago , @entity10 created his most infamous @entity6 forum called " @entity74 " -- images of teenage girls posted without their or their families ' consent			1
he said it became so popular , drawing hundreds of thousands of page views , that @entity6 gave him an award -- a gold - plated bobblehead doll " for making significant contributions to the site			1
" in an email to @entity2 , @entity6 said @entity10 had won a community vote for " @entity87 " and @entity6 now " regrets having sent the trophy			1
" @entity6 also said it banned @entity10 's " @entity10 " account several times since last year , adding that it " regret ( s ) not taking stronger action sooner			1
" looking back , @entity10 said his actions " were a huge mistake			1
" he claimed he was addicted to @entity6 and could not stop himself			2
the biggest thrill @entity10 said he got " was those meaningless internet points , " earned when " @entity99 " voted for his posts			2
now that he 's lost his job , @entity10 told @entity2 he was sorry -- but he did n't say exactly what he was apologizing for			1
" well , i am to some degree apologizing for what i did , " @entity10 said			2
" again , i was playing to an audience of college kids			0
and you know , when two years ago , when all of this was at its height , the audience was appreciative and supportive of the sort of gallows humor that i put out there			0
" legal analysts are split on whether @entity6 is breaking any laws by allowing its users to post such heinous images			2
@entity6 stressed in its email to @entity2 that it " follows all the legal requirements regarding illegal content , including reporting to the proper authorities			1
" by its nature , moderators at @entity6 have complete control over the subsections they start unless they violate site rules or the law , " it said			0
@entity2 legal contributor @entity132 said she believes the website is hosting " borderline kiddie porn			0
" @entity2 senior legal analyst @entity136 noted that while the website may not be breaking any criminal laws , its claim that it can not interfere with its posters because they are protected by the @entity141 is " not true			0
" " if i say something terrible to you on the phone , you can sue me -- you ca n't sue the phone company , " @entity136 explained on @entity2 's @entity144 last year			2
" a website is different			0
a website automatically exercises some control			0
you can see they have rules there			0
so the idea that they have no control over their posters , that 's simply wrong			0
" @entity10 has not been charged with a crime			0
he was , however , questioned by police because of assertions that he had sex with his stepdaughter			0
he said it 's not true			0
