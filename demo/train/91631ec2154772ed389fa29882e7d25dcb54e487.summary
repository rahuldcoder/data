@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 , @entity4 's second - largest oil producer , has launched a $ 5 billion sovereign wealth fund in an attempt to diversify its economy -- a move more associated with wealthy @entity9 like @entity10 and the @entity11			1
the state - owned investment fund , known as the @entity13 , will invest domestically and internationally , focusing on infrastructure development and the hospitality industry			0
these are two areas the @entity17 believes is " likely to exhibit strong growth "			0
in an exclusive interview with @entity2 , @entity19 , the son of @entity1 's longtime president who is on the board of the fund , said " now is a very good time			1
" he added : " the country has had around five years of steady growth , good growth , mostly based on oil production increases , and it plans to diversify the economy			1
the best way to do that is to do that is to intervene directly in the economy through investments			0
" more than 90 % of @entity1 's revenue comes from oil production -- reaching around 1.9 million barrels a day -- and it is second only to @entity37 in its exports			1
but despite its oil wealth , the country remains largely impoverished			0
@entity42 says the aim of the fund is to invest profits accrued from oil to promote social development in the country			2
" it is very easy to have oil money and spend it but it is very difficult to have a positive impact to improve people 's lives on a daily basis , " he said , " and that is an area we intend to invest on a lot with the sovereign wealth fund			2

" we do n't see the money that is being generated from oil having a direct impact on people 's lives " says @entity72 , @entity1 country director for @entity74 ' @entity73			1
" just look at the schools , look at the hospitals , look at the issue of water , electricity			0
@entity1 makes a lot of money out of oil , there is no doubt about this , @entity1 really is one of the few countries that can pay its national budget without donor funding , which is great , but where this money goes , that 's the biggest issue "			1
@entity72 's also argues that a $ 135 million development project of the capital city 's waterfront is a sign of the government getting its spending priorities wrong			0
@entity0 's once shabby waterfront has been transformed after land was reclaimed from the sea			0
@entity106 expats , many of whom have sought sanctuary here from the eurozone crisis , now jog past manicured lawns each morning			0
but wedged between the shiny offices and apartments that line this new waterfront , @entity1 often struggle to survive in a shacks and ramshackle houses			0
beyond the capital lies a large underdeveloped country with a widening income gap			0
only around one in three @entity1 are literate and more than half drop out before finishing primary school			0
@entity1 has faced huge challenges to develop a country decimated by the war for independence and lengthy civil war			2

and the younger dos @entity19 says he -- despite being the president 's son -- is qualified for the position because his financial background			1
@entity146 recently ranked @entity1 a lowly 168 out of 182 countries in its " @entity148 " but @entity42 says that the fund will be beholden to international best practices , and transparent			1
" we are familiar with the fact that this perception exists and we are taking a lot of care to make sure all of our investments are within an approved investment policy and our accounts will be audited annually by an independent renowned auditor			0
" the pledge of transparency is a departure from @entity1 's often opaque oil wealth where oil receipts are withheld by strict confidentiality agreements with international oil companies			2
" the way the government manages the oil receipts , we think we still have a lot of corruption " says @entity168 , @entity169 professor from @entity1 's @entity170			1
" we think the lack of transparency is also another situation we have to look at to understand why the oil income does not go to the majority of the people "			0
@entity1 's oil industry is dominated by @entity183 , the state - owned company that gives concessions to international oil companies and , over time , takes in the lion 's share of the profits			2
many observers believe that @entity183 was already acting as a sovereign wealth fund by investing its profits in many areas outside of the oil industry -- including buying up key stakes in @entity106 's biggest bank by assets , @entity196			2
the formation of a formalized fund was first announced by @entity1 's president @entity199			1
but the global financial crisis caused the oil price to plunge , hammering @entity1 's economy			2
the government had to offset the crisis by securing a loan from the @entity207 ( @entity207 ) in the form of a @entity209 of around $ 1.4 billion			0
with new deep water oil finds announced by the government , @entity1 hopes to outstrip @entity37 to become @entity4 's largest oil producer			1
but the revenue from @entity1 's black gold wo n't last forever			2
the government hopes the sovereign wealth fund will help diversify @entity1 's profits to secure its future .			1
