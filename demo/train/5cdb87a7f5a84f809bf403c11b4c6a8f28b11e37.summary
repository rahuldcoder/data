-- when i 'm updating my guidebooks , one of my favorite places to visit is rollicking @entity5			1
this @entity7 metropolis is ever changing -- and ever crowded with fun - loving sightseers			0
the @entity9 in @entity5 is re-opening after a three - year renovation			1
throughout the year , visitors line up to see its three top sights : the @entity13 , the @entity14 ( with @entity15 , vermeers and more ) , and the compelling @entity17			1
the lines at the sights are generally for buying tickets rather than getting in			0
to avoid the wait , simply buy your tickets online on the museums ' web sites			0
the @entity13 offers the world 's finest collection of @entity29 's paintings			1
but from now through june , it 's filled with even more			1
the special " @entity35 and the @entity37 " exhibit gathers together the artist 's nighttime works from other museums , including the world - famous " @entity33			2
" if you want to complement your @entity7 art appreciation with some @entity7 alcohol appreciation , gin drinkers can learn the fine points , create their own blend , and then have a bartender mix it on the spot at the new @entity47 : @entity48			2
this modern distillery , designed to give tourists an appreciation of @entity7 gin , just opened across the street from the @entity13			1
( and a few blocks away , beer lovers can soak up the recently re-opened @entity56 , located at the site of the former @entity59 brewery			0
) on sunny summer days , the @entity14 offers a fun " lunch - box - with - a - blanket - in - the - park " deal ( about $ 17 with museum entry or about $ 6 for just the boxed lunch and a loaner blanket )			0
there are plenty of picnic spots on the pleasant museum grounds between the @entity72 and @entity35 museums			0
across town , on the park - like square called the @entity75 , you can now experience @entity78 's masterpiece , " @entity77 , " in @entity79 by checking out a new , kid - friendly statue based on the painting			1
if inspired by your visit to the @entity17 , buy their new pamphlet , " @entity90 in @entity5 " ( 75 cents ) , which leads you on a self - guided walk to the @entity87 and its impressive @entity89 exhibits			1
fans of handbags , and perhaps even their reluctant spouses , will enjoy the hardworking @entity94 ( @entity94 ) , which fills an elegant 1664 canal house with artifacts from 500 fascinating and creative years of bag and purse history			2
the @entity9 on @entity5 's @entity99 re-opens to the public in june after three years of extensive renovations			1
when constructed in 1648 , this sumptuous building was one of @entity104 's finest			2
today , it 's the official ( though not actual ) residence of @entity107 ( she lives in the @entity108 )			2
in @entity5 's infamous @entity112 , a number of the windows that once displayed prostitutes now showcase the latest fashions -- lit by lights that are n't red			1
the city government is trying to rein in the sex trade and give the area -- so popular among certain " window - shopping " visitors -- a little elegance			0
it 's taken over the window leases from landlords and rented them to local fashion designers instead			2
@entity5 's @entity126 is being renovated and will remain a messy construction project that 's expected to inconvenience travelers through 2012			1
you can save lots of time by getting train tickets and information in a small - town station ( such as @entity135 ) or at @entity137 's station ( where there 's wonderful service )			2
@entity5 's towering yet relaxed @entity140 , a short walk from its train station , offers hundreds of fast internet terminals and welcomes tourists as well as locals to get online for free			1
while you 're there , enjoy the dramatic views from its terrace and a reasonable meal from its slick top - floor cafeteria			0
or , perhaps you 'd like to check your email in a fog of marijuana smoke at one of the city 's many " coffeeshops			2
" the @entity7 use this @entity161 word to describe places that sell cannabis			0
while indoor tobacco smoke was banned in 2008 , pot smoke is no problem in these shops			0
in a twist that would seem strange to @entity170 , @entity7 coffeeshops can actually lose their license if they allow tobacco smoking inside their premises			0
@entity174 , idyllic @entity175 -- dreamy as a painting by hometown artist @entity177 -- now offers a fine @entity178			1
while it does n't have any of the @entity7 master 's 30 - some originals ( though @entity5 's @entity14 has several ) , the center does a good job tracing the creative mind of @entity175 's favorite resident , and its shop is the ideal place to buy some " sou - vermeers			1
" for about $ 13 , the tourist office offers a two - hour walking tour of the town that includes a canal boat trip -- just right to savor the place that inspired so much fine art. offering new sights and old masterpieces , the @entity7 do a dandy job of making this little country a delight for travelers			0
@entity199 writes @entity104 travel guidebooks and hosts travel shows on public television and public radio			0
e-mail him at @entity205 , or write to him c / o @entity206 2009 , @entity207 , @entity208			0
