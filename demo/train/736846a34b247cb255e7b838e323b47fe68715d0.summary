-- @entity2 's " civilization " is now 20 years old			1
but for someone who has been involved in video games since the mid- ' 80s , one of @entity2 's early prophesies is just now coming true because of mobile and social gaming technologies , he told @entity0			1
" i 've always said that games will someday take over the world and that seems to be happening , " he said			0
@entity2 is considered to be one of the great game designers			1
he serves as director of creative development for @entity13			1
he sat down with @entity0 to reflect on the short history of video games and what he hopes will be their long future			0
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : congratulations on 20 years of " civilization			2
" when you were first coming up with the idea , did you imagine that it would stand the test of time ? @entity2 : i wanted to make a game that was fun to play			1
where it is today , i would n't have dreamed			1
we made the first " civilization " game because it was a game that we wanted to play and hoped that if we liked it , others would , too			1
lucky for us , people latched on to the game and our fan community has made the game what it is now			2
@entity0 : where do you find inspiration ? @entity2 : the themes for all of my games are inspired by things i 've been interested in my whole life : history , pirates , railroads , airplanes , golf , etc. are all things that i enjoy , so i wanted to make games based on these subjects			1
for " civilization " games , we get a lot of our inspiration from our fans and the talented folks who work on the games			2
while i have my own ideas to contribute , by bringing in designers with a fresh perspective , we 're able to continue growing and developing " civilization " to create a new gameplay experience with each iteration of the game			1
i 've also been inspired by other developers and games such as @entity76 's " @entity75 , " the first " @entity77 , " which really set the stage for the first " civilization			1
" also , @entity80 , one of my design partners during @entity82 's early days , created one of the best @entity85 games ever made , the " @entity87 " series			0
i 'm also a big fan of @entity88 who created the first open ended adventure game , " the @entity91			0
" @entity0 : what is the greatest innovation or idea that has been introduced in the " civilization " franchise ? @entity2 : each " @entity98 " game is unique because the designer brings their own unique ideas to the game			1
the biggest changes lately were the hexagonal world tiles , the one - unit - per - tile combat system and the beautiful graphics in " @entity107 " we 'd thought about hex tiles all the way back in the original " @entity98 , " but never tried it until " @entity107 " the one - unit - per - tile system makes combat much more tactical and fun to play			1
and the graphics take the gameplay experience to a wonderful new place			0
maybe the biggest change to the civilization series as a whole is that we 've managed to bring it to a variety of new audiences through our console , mobile and @entity126 versions of the game			2
@entity0 : what were some of the best times and hardest times in gaming for you in the last 20 years ? @entity2 : it 's difficult to think of hard times when i get to go into work every day and make games			1
i have the greatest job in the world and feel very fortunate to have been doing this for so long			0
the thrill of designing a new game never seems to grow old for me			0
@entity0 : how has gaming and video games changed in the past two decades ? @entity2 : technology is always changing and giving us new tools to work with			2
@entity148 and console game designers have been taking advantage of this by creating dramatically better graphics and deeper gameplay experiences			1
new technology has also allowed developers to deliver games on a wide array of devices , so people from all walks of life have access to games everywhere from phones to tablets to the @entity165			0
it 's a great time to be a gamer			2
@entity0 : is the social gaming and mobile gaming trend a product of advancing technology leading an audience or a change in the gamer 's philosophy about gaming ? @entity2 : it 's a little bit of the chicken and the egg debate , but i do think advancing technology has allowed us to explore new platforms and areas of games that we did n't previously have at our disposal			1
social and mobile games deliver a different kind of experience than the traditional pc and console games , which seem to appeal to a broader audience than the usual gamer			0
the growth of gaming on so many different platforms , and the diversity of the audience is great news for the gaming industry as a whole			0
@entity0 : has gaming become more important to our culture in terms of entertainment ? @entity2 : games have become the entertainment of choice for people all over the world			2
i 've always said that games will someday take over the world and that seems to be happening			0
there are so many different gaming platforms and a constant stream of new games for players to enjoy in any way they choose			0
it 's exciting to see the rise of games in popular culture in the past few years			0
now it seems that everyone plays games on their phones and social networks			0
games and game franchises have become an integral part of mainstream entertainment , and the industry is only 30 years old			0
it 's just the beginning of the greatness still to come .			0
