-- protesters and activists demanding justice for slain @entity5 teen @entity4 are no closer to closure , even with the news that second - degree murder charges were filed against shooter @entity9			1
the charges were the latest development in a heated national debate over race and justice in @entity15			1
the debate on @entity17 mirrored a national outcry , which saw thousands taking to the streets in " @entity22 " marches , demanding that formal charges be filed against @entity9			1
" @entity30 " was a common refrain on the placards of street protesters , and in the comments section of @entity0 and other news and media websites			1
there was also a countervailing opinion of skepticism about the murky details of the case			0
before the charges against @entity9 were filed , many expressed concern over how the case was playing out in the court of public opinion , saying that judgment should be withheld until the legal system had enough time to render a proper verdict			1
reaction to the charges against @entity9 has been mixed , with many ireporters and @entity0 commenters expressing a mixture of relief , puzzlement and disappointment			1
@entity52 , an ireporter from @entity54 , @entity55 , said he believed the special prosecutor in @entity5 made a just decision in filing the charges but was also quick to note that this development does not mean that justice will be served			1
" the @entity4 situation is not the first time a black child has been gunned down for suspicious reasons , " he said			1
" the violence toward black people needs to stop , regardless of whether someone wears a hoodie , wears gold caps in their mouth , or has a style that you deem dangerous or stupid			0
" @entity73 of @entity74 , @entity75 , said he was skeptical of @entity5 's judicial system			2
" it will be very difficult to convict him on second - degree murder charges , " he said			2
" i do n't have too much faith in @entity5 justice , given the @entity83 debacle			2
" other ireporters and @entity0 commenters wondered whether manslaughter charges would have been more appropriate			1
@entity86 of @entity87 , @entity88 , noted that @entity9 's admitting to shooting @entity4 could soften the charges , especially since he voluntarily turned himself in			1
she said she also was mistrustful of the way the case has been portrayed in the media			0
" the prosecutor said public pressure and media coverage did not contribute to the charges being filed , " she said			1
" i find that hard to believe			0
" on february 26 , the 17 - year - old @entity4 was shot dead by community watch officer @entity9 in @entity99 , @entity5			1
the black teenager , who was wearing a hoodie and who was unarmed , was walking to the home of his father 's fiancee when he was shot			2
@entity9 , who is @entity106 , told authorities the killing was an act of self - defense			1
a national uproar began when @entity99 police chief @entity112 said on march 12 that @entity9 had not been charged because there were no grounds to disprove his account of the events			1
commenters flocked to @entity0 and @entity17 to register their outrage			1
@entity119 , an ireporter and @entity122 - area clinical psychologist , echoed the sentiment that racial tension and stereotyping factored in the killing			0
" it points to what researchers have termed ' unconscious racism			0
' people are not even aware of their biases , " she said			0
" @entity4 is dead , and we can not be silent , " said @entity119 , whose brother , @entity134 , was an organizer of some protest rallies in @entity5			2
@entity138 educator and activist @entity137 was more pointed in an @entity17 video titled " @entity4 dead			2
am i next ? " in which he shared his experiences with racial stereotyping and related them to the @entity4 shooting			2
" most black people , like me , put themselves in @entity4 's shoes because it 's what we 've had to deal with , " he said			1
" most whites put themselves in @entity9 's shoes because they 've seen black men before and have been suspicious of them			1
few try to step outside of their shoes			0
" @entity156 videographer @entity155 attended a " @entity22 " march in his city and captured an emotionally fraught interview with a protesting mother and son			0
" this could be @entity4 , " the hoodie - clad mother said , nodding to her son as the wail of police sirens tore through the night air			2
" we 're all @entity4 's mother , as far as i 'm concerned			1
" she added , " i have two sons -- one of them is 22 ; this one is 13			0
any of them could be in the same situation			0
i could be in the same situation			0
" as more facts in the case emerged , the conversation shifted to the controversy surrounding @entity5 's " @entity185 " law , which allows for the use of deadly force in cases of self - defense			2
defenders of the law have said @entity9 's actions were legal and justifiable on these grounds , while critics argue that such laws precipitated @entity4 's death			1
@entity156 ireporter @entity193 expressed support for " @entity185 " and similar laws , citing the safety of his two young daughters			0
he said he wanted to feel like his house was secure and did not want to be defenseless if it were ever broken into by an intruder			0
" if you do n't have a gun , then how are you going to protect yourself from someone who is armed ? " he asked			0
@entity205 of @entity206 , @entity207 , said he felt differently , calling these laws " scary			0
" " as an @entity209 , i could be walking home from a bar somewhere late at night and someone could look at me and shoot me and not be prosecuted to the full extent of the law because of this rule , " @entity205 said			0
@entity216 , an ireporter from @entity218 , @entity156 , decried what he saw a " rush to judgment " in media outlets ' coverage of the shooting and protests and said he hoped to see due process properly play out			0
" can you imagine what this world would be like if we took the law into our own hands , made decisions without due process ? " he asked			0
" we would have no world			0
" but even though legal proceedings are now in motion , @entity235 of @entity236 , @entity237 , expressed bitter disappointment at how long they take , describing the arrest as " anticlimactic and late			2
" " justice was delayed because of who @entity4 was : a black kid who , as far as the justice system was concerned , was of lesser value			1
there was so much that was done wrong with this case , " he said			0
" the @entity15 has displayed what many already know : there are two justice systems in @entity15			2
