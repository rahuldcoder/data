-- an electrical fire on board a @entity4 caused the plane to lose primary electrical power during a test flight tuesday , the company said			1
the crew relied upon backup systems to land the aircraft			1
" the pilots executed a safe landing and at all times had positive control of the airplane and all of the information necessary to perform that safe landing , " @entity4 spokeswoman @entity11 said wednesday			2
@entity4 is analyzing flight data from the plane , a process it says will take several days , to determine the exact cause of the fire			1
the company 's initial inspection of the aircraft indicated damage to a power control panel in the rear of the aircraft			2
@entity4 employees were conducting a test of a system designed to prevent fires when smoke began filling the back of the cabin of the next - generation @entity4 , according to the company			1
the crew was testing a " nitrogen generation system , " which separates nitrogen from ambient air and pumps it into fuel tanks as jet fuel is burned during a flight , @entity4 said			1
the system is designed to prevent oxygen from filling the empty space and potentially igniting the fuel			2
there is no indication , however , that tuesday 's fire was caused by the nitrogen generation system , according to @entity4 spokesman @entity54			1
@entity4 is grounding its entire fleet of test dreamliners pending results of its analysis of hundreds of different data measurements to determine the cause of the fire			1
the @entity4 departed from @entity62 , @entity63			2
after about six hours of flight , smoke entered the cabin as the plane was on approach to @entity69 , @entity70			0
" it 's something that needs to be taken very seriously , " said @entity54			0
" we need to know what happened before we can determine the likelihood of its repeatability			0
" the 42 people aboard evacuated using the plane 's emergency slides , @entity78 spokeswoman @entity77 said			0
one person was injured during the evacuation			0
" we are continuing to gather data regarding this event , " @entity84 said in a statement			0
" it 's too early to tell what may have gone wrong			0
" the plane is the second of six test dreamliners , having undergone 179 flights and 558 hours of flight , according to @entity4 data posted on its website			1
the company does not intend to sell the test plane to any airline customers			0
@entity4 says it still intends to deliver the first 787 - 08 dreamliner to @entity100 in the middle of the first quarter of next year			2
@entity100 has 55 @entity103 on order , which @entity4 plans to deliver over the course of several years			2
the @entity4 is @entity4 's new passenger jet , touted as a highly fuel - efficient aircraft made largely with composite materials			1
it made its maiden flight in december 2009 after two years of delays , but the head of @entity4 's commercial aircraft division told @entity0 in july that the @entity4 could still make its debut in early 2011			1
the company has nearly 900 orders for the jet around the world			0
aviation experts say @entity4 's testing problems are not indicative of the @entity4 's ultimate safety			1
" if i were a prospective passenger in a 787 i would n't be concerned , " said @entity121 , assistant professor of aerospace engineering at @entity123			0
" all these bugs will be weeded out			0
" " @entity4 is quite thorough , not just because of requirements from the @entity78 but because of @entity4 's position in the industry , " added @entity125 , a former @entity4 electrical engineer			1
