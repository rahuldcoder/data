-- there was nothing flashy about @entity3 , nothing to announce , " here 's the high - profile criminal attorney , " as she stood in court monday beside the man accused in the @entity10 rampage killings			1
but @entity11 is , perhaps , the best defense lawyer you 've never heard of			1
a longtime colleague calls her lack of ego " almost freakish			0
" she faces an uphill battle defending @entity17 , who shaved his head and offered an unsettling smile for his mug shot			1
the crime is shocking , and her client already is publicly reviled			0
but public defenders are the embodiment of a criminal justice system that believes everyone is innocent until proved guilty , that even people accused of horrific crimes deserve someone to stand up for them and find their humanity			0
many of @entity32 colleagues believe she is the perfect lawyer for the job			0
" @entity3 is as genuine as a person can be , " said @entity35 , who attended law school with @entity11 and has worked on cases with her			1
" she explodes every myth about lawyers			0
she is motivated by a passion to stick up for the little guy , and there is nobody littler than a defendant accused of a horrendous crime who everybody wants to string up			0
" @entity17 , 22 , is charged in federal court with five crimes , including killing a federal judge and congressional aide and attempting to assassinate @entity55 rep. @entity54			1
he also faces prosecution in the state courts for allegedly killing four others , including a child , outside a supermarket in @entity61 , @entity10			2
already , there is talk of the death penalty			2
" i 'm glad she 's on the case			2
she 's a great lawyer , " said @entity67 , a former federal public defender from @entity68 , @entity69			2
@entity71 recruited @entity11 to help him with the @entity73 case			1
" she 's a walking encyclopedia , she knows the law , and she has great empathy for the client , " he added			2
" she does it all			0
" the federal bench in @entity10 stepped down tuesday from handling the @entity17 case because one of its own , @entity55 district judge @entity82 , is among the dead			1
the decision came a day after @entity11 quietly raised the point in court			1
legal colleagues consider @entity11 , 58 , to be the nation 's foremost expert on defending federal capital cases			1
" i really ca n't think of anyone better to assign as defense counsel to this case , " said @entity91 , a professor at @entity92 and a former federal prosecutor			0
" she is familiar with the federal death penalty , insanity defenses , high - profile cases , and difficult clients			1
the defendant is going to need good counsel , and he 's got it			2
" @entity11 has no taste for designer clothes , sound bites or talking heads			1
in fact , she has absolutely no use for the media			0
as a public defender , she did n't need publicity to hustle up paying clients			0
she was on a government salary , and there was no shortage of poor defendants			0
for much of her 30 - year career , @entity11 ran the federal public defender 's offices in @entity123 , @entity69 , and @entity124 , @entity125			1
in the mid- 1990s , she became the first federal public defender to head the @entity127			0
now , even though she is in private practice , other public defenders seek her help on the tough cases			2
and so , @entity11 prefers to do her talking to judges , juries , other lawyers and law students			1
not surprisingly , @entity11 did not return @entity0 's calls for comment			1
but she spoke freely last year with the magazine at @entity125 and @entity140 , where she and her husband teach , as does @entity35			0
she is a visiting professor , teaching third - year law students , and she articulated the philosophy that defines her as a defense lawyer : " we stand between the power of the state and the individual , and in doing so defend the core values that make this country great , " @entity11 said			1
" none of us , including those accused of a crime , wants to be defined by the worst moment , or the worst day of our lives			0
" colleagues say @entity11 is highly effective			1
an ardent opponent of the death penalty , she has kept some of the nation 's most despised criminal 's -- baby killers , bombers , white supremacists and terrorists -- off death row			1
you might know some of her clients by the public nicknames they acquired : the @entity73 , the @entity174 bomber and the 20th hijacker			1
@entity11 is so relentless , her work ethic so formidable , that she often seems driven			1
but her ambition is not for herself , colleagues say			0
she believes in the system			0
she was raised in @entity181 , @entity182 , and graduated in 1974 from @entity183 in @entity184 , @entity185			0
she received her law degree in 1977 from the @entity187 , where @entity35 was a couple of years ahead of her and served as a student adviser			0
her talent was immediately apparent , he said			0
later , as a defense attorney in @entity185 , @entity35 recruited @entity193 to help him defend @entity194 , the emotionally disturbed mother who in october 1994 strapped her two boys into her car and let it roll into a lake , drowning them			1
the defense argued that it was a failed suicide attempt			0
it was @entity11 's first capital case			1
" this is not a case about evil , " she told the jury as the trial began in state court during the summer of 1995			0
" this is a case about despair and sadness			0
" @entity11 did n't argue insanity but brought her client 's abusive childhood and adult depression alive for the jury			1
she portrayed @entity194 as a woman so tormented by her failures in life that she even failed at her own suicide and jumped out of the car			1
" she snapped and @entity224 and @entity225 are gone , " @entity11 told jurors			1
" @entity194 broke where many of us might bend			1
" she let jurors feel @entity230 confusion and pain , and they took 2½ hours to convict @entity194 of murdering her sons			1
but they spared her life			0
afterward , the judge was so impressed with @entity237 work , he increased her pay to $ 83,000			2
she paid the taxes and donated the money to a nonprofit agency that defends the poor in capital cases			1
state officials were not so impressed			0
they passed a law that prohibited out - of - state lawyers from working on @entity248 death penalty cases			1
that law is still on the books , @entity35 said			0
@entity11 went on to join the defense teams in other high - profile capital cases in the federal courts			1
all were settled through plea bargains that took the death penalty off the table			2
among them : @entity73 : the mathematician known as the @entity73 pleaded guilty in january 1998 to making and transporting bomb materials that killed three people			1
federal prosecutors in @entity68 , @entity69 , backed away from the death penalty after their own expert diagnosed him as a paranoid schizophrenic			2
@entity264 : the @entity266 member pleaded guilty in 2001 and was sentenced to five life terms for a racially motivated shooting spree at a @entity270 @entity269 , and the fatal shooting of a @entity273 - @entity55 postal worker in 1999			2
prosecutors dropped the death penalty when the defense documented and charted @entity278 's long history of psychiatric treatment for bipolar disorder			2
the decision later was criticized by the victims ' families			0
@entity284 : the man known as the @entity174 bomber pleaded guilty in 2005 to bombing a women 's clinic in @entity288 , @entity289 , and other bombings -- including the one at the @entity291 in @entity292 , @entity293			2
he was a survivalist and spent years on the @entity296 's most wanted list			0
prosecutors dropped the death penalty after @entity284 led them to several dynamite caches in the @entity182 woods			0
@entity301 : the 9/11 conspirator is sometimes referred to as the 20th hijacker			0
@entity11 worked only briefly on this case			2
he repeatedly fired his lawyers and insisted on defending himself , abruptly pleading guilty to terror conspiracy charges in july 2002			0
