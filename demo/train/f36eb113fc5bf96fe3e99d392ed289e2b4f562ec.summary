" she 's more than all right with that			0
@entity1 is hoping to attract a broad audience for her daytime talk show			1
" i love it , " she said , letting out a throaty laugh			0
@entity1 is not at all bothered if people poke fun , because at least they are talking about her new show			1
long known to her radio fans for her outspoken nature and sometimes controversial interviews with celebrities , she is now navigating the switch from radio to television with " the @entity21			1
" @entity1 ' mix of celeb guests , " @entity26 " and straight - forward advice to audience members led @entity28 's critic - at - large @entity27 to headline a recent blog item " are you watching ' the @entity21 ' ? you should be			1
" the talk show host said she is settling comfortably into her new role			0
" the radio was wonderful , and for 23 wonderful years , the radio served me , and i served it , " said @entity1 , who is scheduled to be inducted into the @entity35 this fall			1
" the transition for me seems very natural and very easy			0
" her career has not always been so			0
a self - described " @entity48 girl , " @entity1 was reportedly dumped from @entity43 's @entity42 radio station in 1998 after a run - in with a fellow on - air personality			1

" it 's more polished , " she said			0
" four hours on the radio versus one hour on tv -- that means you that you have to have five words instead of 35 words to explain what you are talking about			0

" @entity91 , executive producer of the show , said daytime television needs @entity1 ' bluntness			1
" @entity1 has a really unique , honest personality who audiences really relate to , " he said			2

" @entity1 's not hiding anything from anybody about herself , and she 's not afraid to show all of her faults			2
" during a recent phone interview , @entity1 , mother of a 9 - year old boy , chatted easily while trying to get clothes in the washing machine and dinner on the table for her family			2
" after the show , it 's real life , " she said			0
" last night was parent night at school , and i forgot to include the box of tissues , pens that erase and a few other things , " @entity1 said			2

" she thinks daytime television fans can relate to her , because ultimately she is a fan , too			1
she rattles off countless shows she enjoys including " @entity129 , " " @entity130 , " " @entity131 " and " dr. oz. " @entity1 said she aspires to attract higher - profile guests on her talk show and hopes the audience will give her time to find her stride			1
