@entity0 -- there 's a fight brewing and it could get ugly			2
in one corner is the @entity5			2
and in the other ... the @entity5			2
the stakes could not be higher			2
the @entity7 has failed to get a majority of @entity9 to vote for its presidential candidates in five of the last six elections			1
and tuesday night 's gubernatorial races -- a win in @entity14 and loss in @entity16 -- sent confusing signals , at best , about where the party is headed			2
5 things we learned from @entity22 the fight spilled out into the open in a race for @entity27 's 1st @entity26 , with two @entity7 the face of the party 's internal civil war			1
establishment - backed @entity31 beat tea party candidate @entity32 in tuesday 's bitter primary			1
the @entity27 race could be just a sample of what may come , and the battle within the @entity7 may get much more intense leading up to the 2014 elections			1
that 's because some republicans -- especially what 's left of the moderate wing -- do n't want a repeat of the 2010 and 2012 elections			2
the @entity7 first regained control of the @entity47 in 2010 and maintained its control two years later			1
confused ? let 's explain			0
2010 was the year of the @entity5 in 2010 , @entity7 gained 63 seats in the @entity47			1
they saw a fighting chance at stopping president @entity54 's expansive health care law and opposing government spending			0
but tension started to rise within the party			2
many lawmakers were aligned with the burgeoning , ultra-conservative tea party movement			1
and in the years since -- particularly after the federal government 's recent shutdown -- those newcomers ' influence has frustrated and threatened the @entity7 's more traditional wing			1
even more worrisome than a fight over ideas is that the split has led to real @entity69 losses			0
so now the moderate wing has decided to fight back			0
' no moderate counterbalance ' " there 's sort of an inquisition going on , " former @entity72 rep. @entity72 of @entity73 said of the @entity75 's efforts			1
and he 's leading the charge against it			0
" there is no moderate counterbalance ... on the money side , " @entity72 , who retired from @entity80 in 2012 after frustration with partisanship and party infighting , told @entity1 in a recent interview			1
" we 've been slow to the dance			0
" now he vows to fight with campaign dollars , dropping the 11th commandment @entity92 made famous about @entity7 not speaking ill of other @entity7			1
as head of the @entity95 , @entity93 is using his group 's campaign arm to fight some well - financed organizations such as @entity99 and @entity100 that finance campaigns of ultra-conservative @entity5 candidates			0
@entity93 's goal is to raise up to $ 10 million to support as many as 10 @entity5 incumbents in the 2014 elections			1
that 's a big lift compared with the previous election when @entity95 , formerly the @entity108 , raised a little more than $ 1 million			0
the return of @entity110 not alone @entity93 is not the only one who has decided to take this route			0
the business community , including the @entity9 @entity114 , and even an official arm of the @entity5 have also decided to get involved			0
big business usually stands back and waits until a general election to flex its financial muscle			0
but it sent a strong signal recently by donating hundreds of thousands of dollars to @entity31 in his @entity27 congressional race			0
it was a rare move and a lot of money for such a primary			2
and the @entity130 " reserves the right " to get involved in primaries " if we ever thought it was necessary to win , " @entity126 , the committee 's communications director , said			2
in defense of ' @entity133 ' @entity72 said the effort is to make the government run better , especially as scorecards and vote watchers keep track of every move @entity7 make in @entity80			1
too often , @entity72 said , republicans are backed into positions to avoid being called a rino -- @entity5 -- and getting pummeled by fellow @entity7 on the campaign trail			1
" i suspect the 87 @entity7 who cast the right vote to reopen the government are not going to be called traitors , " @entity72 said , referring to the recent 16 - day partial government shutdown over @entity144			1
@entity93 promises to support those " traitors " financially -- or at least a few of them			2
election night 2013 : @entity151 wins easily ; @entity16 provides drama he hosted a fund - raiser tuesday night in @entity155 , unveiling a new web ad in which the narrator says , " the time to act is now			0
help us fight to protect @entity160			0
... " the ad plays controversial statements from some of the most fiery @entity7 , including one - time @entity165 candidates @entity166 of @entity167 , @entity168 of @entity169 and @entity170 of @entity171			1
the spot reminds donors that these candidates all have one thing in common : they lost to a @entity176			0
taking a shot at the birther movement , @entity72 said the only question he asks of potential candidates is " if @entity54 was born in the @entity9			1
and if they say yes , then we 'll help them			0
" one candidate @entity72 knows he 's going to help is rep. @entity185 of @entity186			1
the @entity47 veteran and chairman of an appropriations subcommittee faces a challenge from @entity191 , one of three candidates @entity99 has already endorsed			0
" if @entity191 defeats @entity195 , a favorite of the @entity5 leadership and a member of the @entity199 , it will send a shiver down the spine of the party establishment , " @entity99 said about @entity191 's candidacy on its website			2
targeted for defeat @entity99 has tried to defeat a cadre of republicans considered too squishy for the party brand			2
in 2012 , it spent more than $ 600,000 in the @entity5 primary of @entity210 's @entity209 against incumbent @entity211 , according to the @entity212 , which tracks campaign spending			0
@entity211 has a 77 % rating on the @entity99 's issues scorecard , but the group backed an even more conservative challenger -- @entity210 state sen. @entity218			0
however , @entity211 ultimately won the primary and went on to win in november			0
another @entity7 senator facing primary challenge in all , @entity99 spent $ 18 million in 2012 , the @entity212 says			1
nearly $ 10 million was spent to defeat other @entity7			1
@entity168 was one of its candidates			0
he beat longtime sen. @entity224 of @entity169 in the primary but ended up losing to @entity176 @entity226 in the general election			0
" i refer to them as the @entity231 , " @entity72 said about the group and its efforts			1
incumbent @entity232 was another @entity5 defeated in a primary challenge			0
a moderate , he lost to @entity234 , a @entity99 - backed and financed candidate in the 2008 primary for @entity237 's 1st @entity26			0
" some very thoughtful , deep - thinking smart people have been voted out " because they did n't completely align with tea party credentials , @entity232 told @entity1			1
@entity232 said he ca n't afford to back @entity72 's effort financially , but he " supports the idea 100 %			1
" financial drain @entity72 said the aggressive tactics used against @entity7 means the party 's candidates have to spend large amounts of money against each other , making it more difficult to have enough cash to beat @entity251 in general elections			1
that issue does n't seem to faze @entity99 spokesman @entity254			0
" we care only about passing pro-growth policies , and we do n't care about what some lobbyist thinks about us , " he said , referring to @entity255			0
the water 's warm , " @entity254 said			0
@entity1 poll : @entity7 and tea party unfavorables at all - time highs @entity7 strategist @entity265 said the @entity5 is in a phase where it is taking " two steps back " before it can move forward			1
" this is the biggest problem : @entity271 fights are wasting money , " he said			1
and a lot more money is likely to be spent in this civil war .			2

moderates are moving to battle tea party conservatives for the soul of the @entity7
*ex-* rep. @entity72 is helping raise funds to counter @entity75 support in primaries
" internal fights are wasting money , " @entity7 strategist says
