-- @entity2 president @entity1 insists he will " live and die " in @entity2 , even as countries offer him safe passage in exchange for halting a gruesome civil war			1
" i 'm not a puppet , and i was not made by the @entity9 to go to the @entity9 or to any other country , " he told @entity7			0
i was made in @entity2 and to live and die in @entity2			2
" he also made an ominous threat against foreign intervention , saying it would have a " domino impact " on the world			0
" i think that the cost of foreign invasion of @entity2 , if it happened , would be greater than one that the whole world can afford , " he told @entity7			2
" because if there were problems in @entity2 , particularly as we are the last bastion of secularism , stability and coexistence in the region , it will have a domino impact that will affect the world from the @entity30 to the @entity31			1
" and you know its implications on the rest of the world			0
i do not think that the @entity9 is moving in this direction , but if they do , no one can predict what will happen after			0
" @entity40 's comments came after @entity42 prime minister @entity41 broached the idea of giving him " safe passage " if that 's what it takes to stop the bloodshed in @entity2			1
50 @entity2 soldiers killed in suicide bombing , opposition says " anything , anything to get that man out of the country and to have a safe transition in @entity2 , " @entity41 told @entity52			1
" of course i would favor him facing the full force of international law and justice for what he 's done			0
i am certainly not offering him an exit plan to @entity42 , but if he wants to leave , he could leave ; that could be arranged			0
" even @entity63 , the first country in the region last year to oust its longtime ruler , has offered asylum to @entity1 in an attempt to prevent further violence			2
meanwhile , a prominent @entity2 opposition group and @entity71 leaders are trying to unite the opposition to form an alternative to @entity1 's government			1

@entity140 said the opposition must include seats for " those who are on the front lines fighting and dying today			2
