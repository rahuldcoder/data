@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 began writing thriller novels , she ruled the world of forensic science			1
" i 'm very interested in what motivates people , why they do what they do , how they do it , " @entity4 said			1
" i could treat readers in each book to some new aspect that they would n't be familiar with , " @entity4 said			1
now the author is bombarded with " csi " - like information from every side -- from " bones " to " @entity22 " to , well , " csi			2
" " it 's like you create this monster and find out it 's living in the house with you , and it 's banished you to a room because it has more power than you , " she said			0
@entity4 knew she had to adapt to the changing entertainment climate			1
" one of the questions i really did ask myself was , ' what 's the one thing i have no one else does ? ' " the answer was chief medical examiner @entity37 , @entity4 's heroine			1
@entity37 is independent , feisty and someone @entity4 knows better than she knows herself			1
to honor that close relationship , @entity4 decided to name her 16th book in the series after its main character , titling it simply " @entity37			1
" " i realized , here it is 2008			0
i finished my first book 20 years ago in 1988			2
this is a really big anniversary , " @entity4 said			1
in the novel , @entity37 leaves @entity47 for @entity48 , where the @entity49 has asked her to examine an injured psychiatric patient			1
the patient has a graphic tale to tell -- one of paranoia and murder			0
the novelist said her books all have two things in common : first , of course , is a plot twist that allows @entity37 to make a @entity63 - like deduction			1
the second is intriguing character interaction			0
" what 's going on with them in this book ? what are they doing with or to each other ? who 's in love ? who is n't ? who 's on the outs with whom ? because i hope , in the end , [ my books ] are like high - level , crime soap operas			2
" with two decades of character history , @entity4 has a lot to work with in that area			1
but her books are also full of intellectual fodder			0
@entity37 is a disciplined academic -- a scientist with a law degree			2
@entity4 spent six years working in a medical examiner 's office before writing her first book , and she continues to spend time with professionals to keep up on new forensic technology			1
in recent weeks she has researched an autopsy in @entity96 and worked with the @entity97			0
if she 's going to write about trace evidence , she believes , she 's going to go to a trace evidence lab. " i was never a scientific person , " @entity4 said			2
" when i got interested in science i had to learn it after the fact ... and that was good because i had already learned how to describe things , how to ask questions the audience would want answered			2
i was much better able to translate things into a language someone else could grasp			0
" her dedication to understanding her subject translates into other areas as well			0
@entity4 became a helicopter pilot , a certified scuba diver and qualified for a motorcycle license , all because she was writing about characters who were doing those things			1
fans appreciate @entity4 's enthusiasm and writing style , pushing 12 of her novels onto @entity122 's best - seller lists			2
but @entity4 said " @entity37 " is actually more uplifting than her last couple of books , which took on a more twisted aura			1
" i 'm glad because i think we live in very dark times and no one wants to read a depressing book now			0
" still , @entity4 has been delving deeper into her characters ' minds with each new book , and " @entity37 " wo n't alter that trend			1
" i 'm very interested in what motivates people , why they do what they do , how they do it , " she said			0
" it probably has something to do with where i am in life			0
i 'm 52 years old and i think differently than i did at 42			0
" fans have asked if this is @entity4 's last book in the series -- noting that the title " @entity37 " is very ominous - sounding			1
but she promises to keep writing as long as the characters let her			0
" it 's certainly not by intention to be the last book , " she said			0
" i wanted to make this a very special book			0
i decided that early in the writing process			0
i wanted to make it longer , a richer book , a feast for the fans			0
so no , this is n't the last book about @entity37			1
" which sounds , well , ominous			0
@entity37 , watch out .			2

@entity4 releases 16th book about @entity37 called " @entity37 "
@entity37 leaves @entity47 for new case in @entity48
@entity4 enjoys exploring her characters ' minds and *criminal* *psychology*
author still spends time researching forensic science
