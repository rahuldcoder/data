this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : @entity0 is ubiquitous ! it 's an old word to the @entity16 meaning we 're all over the place : on @entity20 , online , on @entity21 as a free , downloadable podcast			1
wherever you are watching us , we thank you for checking out this tuesday edition of our show			2
i 'm @entity28 ; this is your news for the classroom ! first up : @entity31 @entity32 : first up , how do you stop terrorists from getting hold of materials that could be used to make nuclear weapons ? representatives from dozens of countries are trying to answer that very question at a meeting in @entity42			1
the nuclear security summit being hosted by president @entity44 kicked off yesterday			2
it got going with some meetings between the president and other world leaders			1
some critics have argued that president @entity44 's position on nuclear weapons makes the @entity52 look weak			1
but the president says this concern -- terrorists ending up with nuclear materials -- is the biggest threat to @entity52 security			2
the goal of this summit is for all of the nations that are participating -- there are 47 of them -- to outline how they will each help control nuclear materials and keep them from being spread around the world			1
one of those countries , @entity70 , offered an answer for itself yesterday			2
it said it 'll get rid of its stock of enriched uranium , which can be used to make nuclear weapons , in the next two years			2
@entity76 @entity32 : over on @entity77 , @entity76 is back in session after a two - week spring break			1
the @entity80 starts back to work today			1
the @entity82 got going on monday			1
one of the first things the @entity82 wants to look at is a bill that would extend unemployment benefits			1
you might remember that this bill was supposed to be voted on before the break			2
that did n't happen because of debate over how the legislation would be paid for			2
@entity92 ? @entity13 : " it ai n't over ' til it 's over			1
" words that could be applied to the recession			2
the @entity97 -- that is the only group that can officially announce when a recession begins and ends -- says it 's just too early to tell about this one			1
it does n't know if it 's over yet , or at least , it wo n't say			1
yesterday , the group acknowledged that some economic indicators have started turning in the right direction			2
experts point out that the wait - and - see strategy is n't unusual			1
the @entity97 has n't announced the end date of other recent recessions until more than a year after they were over			2
fast facts @entity108 , @entity14 : time for some @entity109			0
the word " holocaust " describes a destruction that involves a massive loss of life			0
in history , the @entity115 refers to the systematic killings that were carried out by @entity118			0
it took place during @entity121 six million @entity122 and millions of other people were killed during the @entity115			1
@entity124 @entity32 : those victims on the minds of people all over the world as the start of this week marked @entity124			1
in @entity131 , it 's called @entity132			1
and in @entity4 , which is home to more than 200,000 @entity115 survivors , it involves ceremonies and memorials like this one , where people stand up and read the names of family members who were killed by the @entity141			1
you hear sirens ; you see cars stopping on the street , people getting out			1
it 's because of those sirens			1
those are announcing a two - minute moment of silence to remember the victims of the holocaust			1
one @entity52 teen is doing that in his own way through this web site			0
it 's called " @entity160 , " and it was started by @entity159 , who 's 14 years old			1
the site is a collection of the names of @entity115 victims			0
@entity159 's goal is to remember and honor them not just as a group of six million people , but as individuals			1
@entity170 @entity32 : in @entity5 , the government has canceled any activities planned around the country 's @entity174 's celebration because of ongoing protests			1
demonstrators have been facing off with police forces for days			0
and over the weekend , those clashes turned violent			0
21 people were killed , including civilians and members of the military			1
more than 850 other people were injured			1
the protesters are called @entity186			0
they want @entity5 's prime minister to break up parliament , call for new elections , and leave the country			1
they support the country 's former prime minister , who was removed from power in 2006 and fled from @entity5 in 2008 while facing corruption charges			1
the government declared a state of emergency last week ; that allowed security forces to break up large gatherings			0
@entity201 @entity202 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to mrs. @entity205 's class at @entity206 in @entity207 , @entity208 ! what color collar is associated with jobs that involve manual labor ? you know what to do ! is it : a ) @entity216 or @entity217 ) @entity215 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! blue - collar jobs often involve manual labor and a type of uniform			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! the new blue - collar @entity32 : factory workers , construction workers , repairmen : these are all examples of blue - collar jobs			1
many of these workers have faced some struggles recently , including being hit hard by the recession			0
but one @entity6 company is trying to overcome that by combining old and new ideas and changing what it means to be a blue - collar worker			1
( begin video ) @entity245 , @entity246 : snapshots in time of manufacturing 's past in the @entity250 , when cotton was king			1
the textile industry employed hundreds of thousands of workers over the last century			0
today , most of those textile jobs are gone			1
this is all that 's left of that dying industry : empty , decaying factories			1
@entity261 gone overseas where they can be done cheaper			0
even jobs that stayed were fewer than before			0
automation meant companies could do more with less labor			0
the recession saw @entity6 's unemployment rate more than double in just two years to 12.6 percent , the highest in two decades			1
now , @entity6 is fighting back , turning things around with a different approach to manufacturing			0
welcome to the new , high - tech factory operated by @entity275 , owned by a couple of @entity278 grads , @entity279 and @entity280			1
the shop makes parts for the aerospace and energy industries			0
employees spend as much time in the office as in the plant			0
they get their hands dirty , but their brains are stimulated			0
you might call these guys the new blue - collar worker			1
they do n't just operate machines , they program the machine , telling it where to drill			0
then they head to the factory floor and make it happen			0
@entity300 , @entity301 : you get to see the finished work , is what i really love about it			0
we take what 's on paper and we bring it to life			1
@entity312 : they make mathematical computations on the fly if adjustments are needed			0
@entity317 , @entity301 : c point 038			0
@entity312 : each worker is a computer programmer , machinist and quality control engineer ; what typically was three different jobs now wrapped up in one			2
it 's called lean manufacturing , and the workers love it			2
@entity328 , co-owner , @entity329 : in the assembly line method , you might just have a single person who does a single task all day long and that 's all they do			2
it does n't tax the mind			0
and really , what you 're seeing is that the world has changed			2
@entity312 : and it pays like a white - collar job does , from $ 50,000 to as much as $ 80,000 a year , depending on experience and job training			1
unlike in an assembly line factory , the employees say they feel empowered			0
@entity348 : it 's hands - on			1
you get to actually make something , but you still have to think about what you 're doing			0
@entity312 : @entity279 is hoping to change the negative stereotype of manufacturing in hopes of drawing more young people into the industry and help @entity52 industry get back on top again			2
@entity361 : i think a lot of people associate manufacturing with 20 and 30 years ago , when @entity365 was big			2
it was very long hours			0
your boss beat up on you all day			0
we work with our employees			0
it 's not a boss - man mentality			1
very much , we 're asking them , what are your ideas ? how is the best way to produce this ? @entity312 : @entity242 , @entity0 , @entity382			0
( @entity383 ) promo @entity32 : before a lot of you went on @entity387 , you were talking to us on our blog at @entity390 about the issue of bullying			0
almost 90 percent of you say you 've seen it			0
how do you stop it ? how do you deal with it ? we 've put up from our web site , @entity390 , some anti-bullying resources			0
they can get the conversation started in the fight against bullying			0
you 'll find them in the @entity405 section , along with videos			2
we 've got articles , online resources			0
all of it 's free ; all of it 's at @entity390			2
before we go @entity32 : and before we go , your parents might have told you not to play with your food			0
they did n't say anything about your cups ! all right ! this is the @entity420 , where everyone pretty much follows the same pattern : you stack it up , flip it , knock it down			0
more than 700 stacking stars took part in the competition , representing every continent except @entity430			0
hundreds of personal bests ; two world records			2
goodbye @entity32 : the contest was the perfect example of pure speed cup - led with skill			2
