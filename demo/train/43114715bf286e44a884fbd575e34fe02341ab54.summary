@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 took on @entity4 in the @entity6 derby last weekend , and in honor of that we have scoured the world to bring you 10 other local derbies that stir the passions of those involved			1
at the @entity16 and @entity17 matches , the atmosphere can swell to boiling point			1
do n't agree ? think we 've left out a more hotly contested derby ? tell us about one you think should make the top 10 in our sound off box , below			1
1 ) celtic v rangers -- @entity24 , @entity25 these two are the bitterest of bitter rivals			1
not only are they divided by football , but by religion as well , with @entity31 taking their support from the @entity34 community and @entity35 the @entity37 community			1
the hostility has become so intense that both clubs have asked their fans to stop singing the sectarian songs that had become commonplace on match days			2
to add fuel to the fire , they are consistently the only two teams who challenge for the @entity25 title , with the make - up of the @entity49 ensuring they face each other four times in a season , not including cups			1
despite both clubs attracting some top foreign stars , the helter - skelter nature of the fixture has not been diluted over time , as confirmed by the number of dismissals over the years			1
2 ) @entity61 v @entity60 -- @entity62 , @entity63 undoubtedly the fiercest derby match in @entity63 , these two rivals really hate each other			1
violence in and around the @entity68 between the sets of supporters , and the police , has become an all - too - common occurrence in recent seasons			2
both teams hate the perceived arrogance from the @entity77 cities ( @entity78 , @entity6 ) -- but they loathe each other more			1
@entity61 take their support from a traditional working - class fan base , while @entity60 's support tends to come from the wealthier districts			2
the historical political differences between the fans is another reason for this rivalry			2
@entity60 's supporters , in general , followed right - wing ideals while the @entity61 fans leaned more to the left			2
3 ) @entity17 v @entity16 -- @entity91 , @entity92 although by no means the most " local " derby in @entity95 ( the clubs are about 7km apart ) , it is undeniably the most intense			1
the rivalry , hatred and violence involved are based on social class and money			2
both clubs were founded in the poor district of @entity91 called @entity104 , but @entity16 moved to a wealthier area called @entity106 in the 1930s , heightening the animosity between the clubs			1
@entity17 ' stadium is known as " @entity111 " ( @entity112 ) because of its layout			1
the steep stands and the lack of a running track makes for a particularly intimidating atmosphere			0
4 ) @entity119 v @entity118 -- @entity120 , @entity121 arguably @entity124 's most passionate derby , this match brings together two of the continent 's most successful clubs			1
their rivalry is so strong that foreign referees are always brought in for the derby games and , following a number of violent incidents , matches between the two have been moved to the 75,000 capacity @entity134			1
on the pitch , @entity119 currently have the upper hand , winning the last four league titles			1
5 ) @entity139 v @entity140 -- @entity141 , @entity142 the @entity143 separates the city of @entity141 into a @entity146 side and an @entity148 side			0
@entity139 , on the @entity146 side , have traditionally been the wealthier of the two clubs , while @entity140 , on the @entity148 side , have a largely working - class following			0
however , in recent years , @entity140 have attracted a number of wealthy fans who have pumped money into the club , thus unbalancing the equilibrium			0
nowadays , there is nothing to choose between them on and off the pitch			0
the last five league titles have alternated between the two clubs and both clubs have won 17 @entity142 championships			0
6 ) @entity165 v @entity164 -- @entity166 , @entity167 this is the derby between the two giants of @entity167 football , although the rivalry between the two also exists in basketball , @entity167 's national sport			1
in the past , @entity165 , from the port area of @entity175 , used to represent the working class , while @entity164 represented the upper - class suburbs of @entity166			0
nowadays , the situation has evened out			0
however , on the pitch , @entity165 are the dominant club , having won 11 of the last 12 league titles , including the last four in a row			0
7 ) @entity183 v @entity182 -- @entity184 , @entity185 this is a relatively new fixture : both clubs were founded in 1945 , but what they lack in age , they make up for in passion			0
@entity182 was founded as the football section of the central club of the @entity193 , while @entity183 was founded as the civilians ' club			0
@entity183 , or @entity196 as they are now known , have traditionally been the more successful , achieving the ultimate of winning the @entity198 in 1991			0
8 ) @entity200 v raja -- @entity201 , @entity202 these two are the biggest clubs in @entity202 and violence between the fans often mars these fixtures			0
@entity200 used to dominate honors , but in recent seasons @entity209 have enjoyed more success			0
@entity209 means " hope " and @entity200 means " love , " although there is certainly no love between the rivals when they face each other ! 9 ) palmeiras v @entity219 -- @entity220 , @entity221 another derby that has been going for nearly 100 years			1
@entity219 used to be the only club in the city , but a group of @entity63 members broke away to form @entity227 , earning the nickname of the " betrayers " by @entity219 fans			0
@entity231 is the biggest stadium in @entity220 and all the derbies are played there , although the @entity235 stadium , which hosts many @entity219 matches , is also used for the occasion			0
10 ) @entity239 v @entity238 -- @entity240 , @entity241 one of the oldest derby matches in the world , with both clubs being formed in the 1890s			2
the two most honored clubs in @entity241 , they share a remarkable 85 @entity241 league titles and eight @entity250 championships between them			0
the derby is always played in the @entity252 , with a capacity of almost 74,000 , although @entity238 also have their own ground in a different neighborhood of the city			2
