-- @entity2 's impressive 43 points were not enough to end the @entity4 's losing streak in game four of this year 's @entity7 finals			1
they lost 104 - 98 , their third - straight loss against the @entity10			1
the @entity4 , who went into the game down two in the best - of - seven series , looked like a team determined to make a comeback , surging to a quick lead that topped out at 17 points in the first quarter			1
however , the @entity10 brought the game to within three by the half and never looked back -- thanks mainly to the influential @entity21			1
@entity21 , who had 26 points and 12 assists , sat out the final minutes of the game with a cramp in his quadriceps			1
but he went to the bench only after sinking a momentum - changing three - pointer to put the @entity10 up 97 - 94			1

" the @entity10 were also aided by point guard @entity38 , who put up 25 points in his 34 minutes of play			1

" it was just a mis - communication on my part , " @entity2 told reporters after the game			2
" nothing i can do about it now			0
" when asked about whether his performance vindicated himself in anyway after being hit hard by media over the off - season , @entity2 did n't mince words in saying none of it mattered			2
