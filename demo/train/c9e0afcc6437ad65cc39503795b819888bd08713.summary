-- @entity1 announced thursday that rogue trading by one of its investment bank traders had cost the @entity6 banking giant a staggering $ 2 billion			1
but while the loss would potentially be among the largest costs ever to a bank in unauthorized trading , it is far from the first			2
the @entity1 scandal revealed thursday is the latest in a long list of unauthorized trades that have cost banks billions of dollars			0
from foreign currency trading to speculating on futures derivatives , a number of individual rogue traders have destabilized and even caused the collapse of their banks through unauthorized trades in the past twenty years alone			1
@entity25 -- $ 6 billion , @entity26 in january 2008 , @entity27 trader @entity25 was arrested in @entity28 and accused of committing massive fraud that cost @entity30 nearly $ 6 billion			1
@entity25 was involved in the practice of arbitrage at the bank , buying a portfolio of financial instruments -- @entity37 index futures in @entity25 's case -- in one market and selling a similar offsetting portfolio at the same time with a different value in order to minimize risk			0
@entity25 's offsetting portfolio , however , was " fictitious , " according to the bank , meaning @entity25 had in effect made an unhedged bet of a staggering $ 60 billion of @entity26 's money on @entity37 futures without the bank 's knowledge -- a bet that end up costing the bank roughly $ 6 billion			1
33 - year - old @entity25 , who was sentenced to three years in prison last year , insisted he was n't the only one doing this and that his bosses knew of and condoned his behavior while at the bank			0
" during three years these managers earned colossal amounts of money out of bonuses based on the ever growing results that i was making for the bank , " he said			0
@entity62 -- $ 2.6 billion , @entity63 @entity62 was sent to prison for eight years in 1997 for fraud and forgery in the global copper market			0
the copper trader 's unauthorized deals ended up costing @entity70 's @entity63 $ 2.6 billion			2
nicknamed " mr. @entity74 " in reference to the amount of the global copper market he was once estimated to control , @entity62 was accused for years of price - fixing in order to generate exorbitant profits for @entity63			0
the one - time king of the copper market would have @entity63 buy huge quantities of copper and store it for awhile in order to create an artificial shortage of the precious metal , thus driving up demand , before releasing smaller amounts of copper on commodities markets at extremely high prices			0
the decade - long scheme fell apart in 1996 , and in 1998 @entity63 paid $ 150 million to regulators while refusing to admit or deny if the corporation knew about or condoned the actions of its rogue trader			0
@entity97 -- $ 1.3 billion , @entity98 the @entity101 trader 's losses of over a billion dollars singlehandedly brought down @entity98 , the former personal bank to @entity101 's @entity102 , in 1995			1
at first @entity97 , a star trader in @entity98 ' @entity105 branch , made huge profits in the early nineties by speculating on futures derivatives for the bank			2
a loophole in @entity98 ' oversight system allowed @entity97 to settle his own deals , meaning he could set up fake accounts for non-existent clients -- and as his luck began to run out , this is precisely what he did , masking huge losses by placing them in a single secret account while making increasingly risky bets in an attempt to recoup the losses			1
in january 1995 , @entity97 bet that the @entity70 nikkei index would rise after performing poorly the previous year , but his timing could not have been worse -- the @entity126 earthquake on january 17th , the worst in @entity70 in 70 years , sent stock prices plummeting			0
his big bet having failed , @entity97 attempted to flee back to the @entity101 but was arrested and extradited back to @entity105 , where he was sentenced to six and a half years in prison for financial misrepresentation			2
he served three before being released			0
the $ 1.3 billion in liabilities @entity97 ran up wiped out 233 - year - old @entity98 ' capital and reserves , and the bank collapsed			1
@entity135 -- $ 700 million , @entity137 / @entity136 in february 2002 , @entity136 executives called the @entity139 after discovering that both roughly $ 700 million and 37 - year - old trader @entity135 had gone missing from work			1
working for @entity136 's @entity143 subsidiary in @entity144 , @entity145 since 1993 , the foreign currency trader worked under the radar for nearly a decade , betting mostly on the price of the @entity70 yen and racking up hundreds of millions of dollars in small losses that he attempted to hide in fabricated options contracts			1
part of the reason @entity135 was able to perpetrate such massive fraud was poor supervision and financial controls at @entity136 -- although @entity135 's trading limit was $ 2.5 million , by 2002 he was betting up to $ 7.5 billion ( 3,000 times his limit ) of @entity136 's money on currency movements , according to the @entity161			1
@entity136 sold its scandal - hit @entity143 subsidiary in late 2002 , and @entity135 served over seven years in prison .			2

@entity25 cost @entity26 $ 6 billion in unauthorized trading by 2008
@entity135 lost over $ 700 million in currency trading at @entity136 by 2002
@entity97 's $ 1.3 billion in losses brought down @entity101 's @entity98 in 1995
