-- " a service allowing travelers who like to get their thrills between the sheets to get them beneath the waves at the same time			0
" the description provided by luxury travel company @entity7 of its latest offering could n't be more frank			1
the new service , called the @entity10 , targets couples who seek physical excitement underwater in a private submarine nicknamed @entity14 ( in case the rest of the clues are n't obvious enough )			1
the innovative holiday destination -- the submarine in question is moored in the @entity21 -- was launched by the @entity23 travel company to mark its 10th anniversary			1
" we started in business 10 years ago focusing on @entity29 chateaus initially , but launched @entity7 in november , the focus being on more quirky and unique properties , " says @entity7 co-founder @entity25			0
" in order to get life to the new brand , we needed to get some exceptional property ideas			0
" we had a meeting where we asked , ' where 's the coolest place to stay ? ' we started with the moon and obviously realized that would n't be possible so a submarine was the next realistic target , and we found a submarine company with the capability to make it bespoke			1
pockets , too the only catch is you 'll need pockets as deep as the ocean -- the special voyage costs an eye - watering £ 175,000 ( $ 292,000 ) a night			1
the venture was launched , appropriately , for @entity53 , but to date no one has paid up the six - figure sum for a night 's stay			1
@entity25 is confident the first booking is on the cards			0
" we 've obviously had some joke inquiries but i 'd say we have about five realistic inquiries so i expect one to be booked in very soon , " he says			0
" obviously if that happens , it 'll be high fives all around the office			0
" so what exactly do you get for your £ 175,000 a night ? exactly what you want			1
as part of the service , you choose how to deck out the submarine -- which is currently hired by a variety of different businesses for quirky brand launches -- exactly as you like from bedroom to bathroom , and bar to ballroom			2
you have to pay for your own flights , but a speedboat will be on hand to take you to and from your submarine			2
an artist 's impression has been done to mock up how the romantic hideaway might look and how you can get under the waves as well as under the covers			1
the company emphasizes that the crew ( captain , chef and butler ) will considerately occupy separate , soundproof living rooms at the other end of the vessel			1
@entity97 included while the sub is currently in the @entity21 , it can be moored wherever you desire			0
the chef can also offer his in - house aphrodisiac menu including everything from oysters to a fondant of chocolate with an essence of pomegranate			2
not enough to get you in the mood ? on its website , the company promises the smooth tones of @entity97 singing " you 're the first , the last , the everything " over the sound system			2
" well , the @entity97 thing 's a bit of a joke really , " says @entity25			2
" it 's all great fun putting this together but we 're also deadly serious about this			0
" we know it 's not in our usual customer 's price bracket , this is very , very high end , but we think that people with that sort of money will have very specific tastes			0
" it 'll take 12 weeks to kit it out and customers can have exactly what they want			0
" @entity25 's one warning is that however wealthy you might be , it 's probably not one for the claustrophobes out there			0
from the artist 's impression , there 's an element of a @entity145 villain lair to the submarine , akin to the @entity148 home of the character @entity150 , the villain in " @entity150			1
" " to me , it looks really , really cool but you can have it to whatever taste you like , " @entity25 says			0
@entity25 has yet to visit the submarine in question but , because of the increasing interest , he 's planning a trip to the @entity21 to find out what 's in store and how his customers can find love on the ocean floor .			1
