-- take a walk along almost any beach in any part of the world and one 's experience is often spoiled by the sight of trash -- flotsam and jetsam -- washed ashore from the ocean			1
it 's a massive global problem , made worse by the modern use of plastics that do not readily biodegrade			0
one area of the @entity15 has earned the unwanted tag of " the @entity17 " and covers double the size of @entity19 -- with an estimated six kilos of plastic for every kilo of natural plankton			0
this swirls about 20 meters below the surface of the water and , with other slowly degrading garbage , poses an obvious threat to marine life and the ecological balance			0
marine conservation groups have long campaigned for better environmental protection of our oceans , but have now found high - profile support from a pair of world - class long - distance racing sailors -- @entity38 of the @entity39 and @entity41 's @entity40			1
@entity43 focus they have brought into sharp focus a practice that neither other competitors taking part in epic yachting classics nor the sponsors of these events would ever wish to dwell upon			2
crews -- desperate to free up space in their cramped conditions and ever mindful of the need to save weight -- leave their own trail of trash dumped overboard as they sail as fast as possible across the oceans			2
until now it 's been standard practice for their fellow competitors , who must balance environmental concerns with obvious practical necessity , particularly when at sea for extended periods			2
but @entity66 and @entity40 , among the favorites to win the @entity68 -- a month - long , 5,600 - nautical - mile race from @entity70 to @entity71 -- are pledging to stop the dumping as part of a new eco-friendly approach to ocean racing			1
better " is the motto of @entity66 and @entity40 's 11th hour racing team and they want to be as good as their word			1
the pair have been rigorously training for several months in their 40 - foot monohull for the annual event , considered one of the most prestigious on the yachting calendar , which the 44 entries started from @entity89 on thursday after a delay for bad weather			1
education lesson they both admitted that in the past they had been guilty of tossing items like tin and soda cans into the sea , believing that salt water would quickly eat it away			0
but working with the @entity101 , a non-profit organization committed to cleaning up our oceans , has been an eye - opener			0
" the only trash we dump overboard during our journey will be toilet paper , " @entity40 told @entity0 , while acknowledging the scale of their task			1
" we sailed back from @entity112 earlier this year as part of our trials and decided to store how much rubbish we had built up , " she said			2
" three people over six weeks and we came back with eight big bags of rubbish -- and probably six of those would usually be thrown over the side			2
it was shocking , really , " she admitted			0
using a series of advanced technological solutions and working with a nutritionist to help them reduce their reliance on numerous packets of freeze - dried food , the pair are confident they will achieve their goal			0
future generations " i think we all have a responsibility to future generations to do everything we can to protect the environment , " said @entity38			1
" i am hoping that it will set a trend and trickle down across all levels and in particular recreational sailors			2
" behind the pair 's example - setting , trash - busting commitment lies a series of innovative technologies -- with the need to save weight being paramount			0
their boat is equipped with a hydro generator , using the movement of the boat through the water to charge batteries and eliminating the need to run a diesel generator to power their on board facilities			0
it will also provide a massive weight saving because they will need less fuel			0
the hydro generator is backed up by solar panels to provide a further energy source for the navigational systems			0
it is customary for crews to take hundreds of bottles of drinking water on board for a race of this length , but @entity174 is using their own water maker and desalination system to meet this need -- again a big weight saving			0
perhaps the most innovative project the pair will be taking on board will see them attempt to grow fresh produce by harvesting seedlings to grow microgreens			0
fresh food the brainchild of the process is former team member @entity189 , who is hoping @entity66 and @entity40 will be able to supplement their diet of freeze - dried food with edible and healthy food nutrients			1
" if we can do it successfully in the harsh conditions in the middle of an ocean it can definitely be transferred to urban environments , which is its target market , " said @entity38			1
but it is a risk attempting to use such a mix of eco-friendly methods in a race situation			0
" other entrants have used some of these methods before , but we are the first to use all of them as a combination , " said @entity40			1
but after months of grueling training , and taking part in warmup events such as the @entity216 , the pair are confident they can challenge for top honors			0
" there 's been lots of hard work getting to this stage , working our arses off with the ultimate aim to be on the podium , " said @entity38			1
" we are very competitive , " chipped in @entity40 , who at 1.67 meters tall and 58 kg is dwarfed by her 1.88m and 94 kg teammate			1
competitive duo " using @entity40 's smarts and my brawn puts us in a position to do really , really well as a team , " said @entity38			1
@entity40 finished third in the @entity233 , while @entity66 has a pair of second - place finishes in prestigious trans - @entity237 races , but they know the opposition this year will be tough , even before the added pressure of the environmental pledges			1
" this is a hugely iconic race , " said @entity38			1
" in @entity70 offshore racing is huge , it can be compared with the interest in football in the @entity41 and there is plenty of talent in the field			2
" win or lose , both are keen to continue their partnership after the @entity233 , which they view now as being important in changing attitudes in the racing fleet and among the wider public			2
" for us the important thing is to get the best result we can , but also our campaign is more than just getting a podium position , " said @entity40			1
" it 's spreading a message about how we are being cleaner and faster and therefore better , and have that message spread to other sailors to help them run more environmentally friendly			0
