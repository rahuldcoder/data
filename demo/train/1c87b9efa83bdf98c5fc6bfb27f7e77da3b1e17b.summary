@entity0 -- for thousands of @entity4 women and girls , the conflict that began in 2003 was only the start of their ordeals			1
in the chaos of war and the confusion , lawlessness and poverty that followed , an untold number have become victims of sexual traffickers , some within @entity4 and others sold over the borders			1
but the problem of trafficking has gone almost unreported , kept in the shadows by a combination of corruption , religious and cultural taboo and lack of interest by the region 's authorities in tackling it , researchers say			2
a report released by the @entity0 - based non-governmental group @entity33 in the @entity34 ( @entity35 ) wednesday hopes to change that			2
entitled @entity38 , or our dignity , the study highlights the plight of girls as young as 10 or 12 who have been trafficked from post-war @entity4 into countries including @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 and @entity49 for sexual exploitation			1
other victims trafficked within @entity4 end up in nightclubs or brothels , often in @entity54 , the report says			1
some of those brothels " have been established purely to meet the demand created by @entity58 service personnel , " it adds			0
launching the report , @entity59 , a clinical researcher who put her career on hold a year ago in order to produce the study , told a hearing at the @entity65 in @entity0 that she had felt compelled to investigate after realizing the extent of the silence around the issue			1
" what i came across was closed doors , shame , the unwillingness of authorities of @entity45 and @entity46 and the quietness of civil society on the issue , " she writes in the foreword to the study			1
@entity77 also encountered resistance when she raised the issue with the @entity80 and @entity58 authorities whose forces ' presence in @entity4 has been a contributing factor to the problem , she says			1
while sexual exploitation existed in @entity4 , as anywhere , long before the war began in 2003 , " the invasion and instability that followed led to an environment where young women and girls became much more vulnerable to trafficking , " she told the hearing			1
one @entity4 non-governmental organization , the @entity95 for @entity96 in @entity4 , estimates that about 4,000 women , one fifth of them aged under 18 , disappeared in the first seven years after the war			1
although hard data is hard to come by , the group 's research suggests many were trafficked by criminal gangs nationally or internationally , or sold into forced marriage by their own families			2
hundreds of thousands of @entity4 were displaced or made refugees by the war			1
prevented from working legally , some men have forced female relatives into prostitution to earn money for the family			0
others have taken advantage of others ' hardship			0
one case cited by the study is that of 17 - year - old @entity122 , whose impoverished father accepted a man 's offer to hire her for $ 200 a month to care for his handicapped wife			2
as well as housework , she was forced to have sex with the man 's son and friends			2
professional trafficking gangs also target young women after they flee home to escape forced marriage , abuse or violence , the report says			1
in a finding that may surprise some people , many of the traffickers within @entity4 are women , the study says			1
while some of those have themselves been victims of sexual exploitation , @entity77 says , others are in it for the easy money			0
other traffickers are taxi drivers who lure girls with false offers of help and then take them to brothels , or young men recruited by gangs who trick vulnerable young girls into eloping and then sell them into sexual servitude			1
some young victims are tricked into thinking a marriage proposal is genuine , @entity77 said -- and then after being sexually exploited are swiftly divorced and dumped in the streets , all honor gone in the eyes of conservative @entity166 society			1
they are then easy targets for further abuse			0
once in the hands of the traffickers , the victims face a grim future			0
one girl , identified as @entity175 , was left by her father at the @entity45 border , the study says			0
she was trafficked to @entity178 , where she was raped by five men and sold to a woman who forced her to work as a prostitute in nightclubs			1
many women forced into the sex trade then feel trapped , unable to leave because of threats to their family and a lack of any future in a conservative , predominantly @entity191 society that tends to see them as to blame for their " shame			1
" @entity77 , who spoke to some victims of sex trafficking in @entity47 , said the women painted a dismal picture			1
" in the beginning it 's a nightmare , " she said			0
" then they realize there 's no choice , they can not run away			0
" one woman recounted how when those who had trafficked her learned she planned to flee , they threatened to destroy the life of her daughter by making her shame public -- so she opted to stay , @entity77 said			0
" it comes to the price of their lives , the price of their families , " she said			0
another cruel practice , particularly in @entity45 , is the " mut'a " marriage , in which a girl is married off for a price to a man on a friday , only for him to divorce her on the sunday			0
" research suggests that the rates at which these mut'a marriages are carried out intensifies in the summer when male tourists visit @entity45 from the @entity229 , " the study says			0
" although this particular kind of marriage is not explicitly called prostitution , it is in effect sexual exploitation , often forced , as a means of either securing livelihood , or generating profit			0
" while anti-trafficking and prostitution laws exist in many countries in the region , the will to enforce them appears weak -- and they fail to offer much protection for the victims			0
in a move in the right direction , @entity45 strengthened its anti-trafficking laws last year , the study says , and toughened the penalties against men involved in trafficking			2
however , women who have been forced into prostitution continue to face sanctions too			0
@entity45 also deports @entity4 refugees found illegally working in the country -- including women forced into the sex trade			1
meanwhile , provision of shelters , health care or psychological support for the stigmatized victims of sexual exploitation , who have little other chance of employment , is almost non-existent across the region , @entity77 said			0
she sees improved education and increased awareness as key factors in protecting future generations of women and girls			2
she also hopes to carry out more field research , to bolster what little hard evidence is available on an issue shrouded in secrecy			1
the group 's efforts were hampered over the past year by the @entity284 uprising , which made access to many places difficult or dangerous			0
@entity287 , of the @entity95 for @entity96 in @entity4 , which published its own report on prostitution in @entity4 last year , told the hearing the @entity4 government had opposed her group 's work and tried to block its access to the media			2
she urged @entity297 governments to do more to put pressure on their @entity166 counterparts to tackle sexual exploitation , and to ensure they do not send vulnerable asylum seekers back to a situation where they may be trafficked again			2
religious leaders should play a role by using their influence to change attitudes within society rather than demonizing women who are sexually exploited , she added			2
change wo n't be easy though			0
at the heart of the issue are the men who are happy to hand over money for sex -- and the corrupt officials at borders and elsewhere who turn a blind eye to what 's happening to vulnerable women			1
" the problem is there 's a demand for this , there 's a market for this , " said @entity322			0
" this is about money - making and profits			0
