-- @entity0 spoke with @entity2 swimmer @entity1 about his journey from nearly drowning to winning the @entity2 gold			1
here , he talks about giving back to the community by promoting water safety for all with the @entity7			1
how did you get involved with the @entity7 , and why do you think it 's so important ? i got involved with the @entity7 in 2008 right after winning the @entity10			1
@entity11 and @entity12 came and approached me and showed me the drowning statistics			0
after reading that 70 % of @entity15 do n't know how to swim and 60 % of @entity16 do n't know how to swim , that 's when it became very real to me			1
this initiative has been a very , very big part of my life in the past five years			0
we are seeing the numbers changing , so it 's been a success			0
parenting.com : parenting advice from @entity2 moms and dads what do you think is the cause behind these numbers ? why is being able to swim so uncommon in @entity15 and @entity16 communities ? well , the @entity34 put out a study in 2010 , and you see three major factors : number one being fear , number two being parental backing and number three being physical appearance			1
so with knowing that information , the number one thing that we have seen when it comes to parents and children , fear trumps everything ... so we 're really trying to fight an uphill battle			1
and i understand completely , as a five - year - old , i almost drowned			0
we are seeing that children themselves are either afraid because of an instance where they have had a bad experience or parents projecting their fears			1
parenting.com : @entity61 's perks for families do you remember what your first swimming lesson was like ? i was a little nervous , obviously because i had almost drowned a couple weeks prior			0
so i understand where a lot of kids are coming from			0
i enjoy traveling all over the @entity69 and having kids that are so nervous and kind of getting them to understand and relax around the water			2
it has been a pleasure and very humbling for me as an @entity2 athlete to kind of give back and see kids that remind me of myself at that age			0
parenting.com : shocking pool safety hazard what is a good age for a child to learn how to swim ? what is a good age to enroll them in swim lessons ? you know , it is never too early , and it is never too late to get kids involved in swim lessons			1
i taught , at the age of 15 , a mommy and me class with newborns			0
parents had their babies in the water , splashing around and just getting them comfortable			1
so there is never really an age , as long as you have someone present , someone responsible there , to teach			2
parenting.com : @entity2 champion summer @entity106 talks life after the gold medal what are the top three things parents need to remember about swimming now that pools are opening around the country ? what kind of advice can parents give to their children should they happen to find themselves in a pool without knowing how to swim ? the number one thing would be definitely to get your kids water safe , get them some lessons , and teach your children how to swim			1
there is no other remedy for drowning than swim lessons , and if you give your children that , you are giving them the tools to be safe			2
the second thing is tell your children never to swim alone			2
i myself , as an @entity2 gold medalist , i even have lifeguards that watch over me when i am training			0
so all kids should have someone that is there , a responsible adult , that is watching out for them as they play , as they swim or as they train for the junior olympics , whatever your next step may be			2
and the last thing is definitely to obey the pool rules			0
every pool has rules like no horseplay			0
with the @entity7 , i travel all over the @entity69 the biggest thing i want to tell kids not only is to be safe around the water , but also is to have fun			1

@entity163 , parental backing and physical appearance contribute to this lack of swim *skills*
parents should teach children how to swim and tell them never to swim alone
