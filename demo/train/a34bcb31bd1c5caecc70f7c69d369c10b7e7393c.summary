@entity1 , @entity0 -- since it became a viable energy resource around 20 years ago , wind power has emerged as a leading renewable technology			1
wind power is a success story of renewable energy			1
finding a way to store the power it generates would increase its contribution to overall energy provision			1
at the end of 2006 the worldwide capacity of all wind turbines was close to 75 gigawatts , which represents around one percent of all electricity use in the world			2
three quarters of that wind power usage is currently based in @entity19			1
the @entity20 lead the way with nearly 20 percent of their electricity created by wind			0
they are followed by @entity24 , which generates around half that amount and @entity26 around seven percent			0
but although it 's clean , plentiful and relatively cheap , there is an inherent problem with wind power			1
it 's not always there when you need it , leaving more conventional , more polluting energy resources to take up the slack			2
the wind 's variability has been one of the sticking points for wind power growth in the @entity43 energy market			1
given the @entity43 's famously inclement weather and its island status -- which offers unrivalled offshore facility - you might think that wind power capacity was being filled at a rate of knots			1
but in reality , wind power currently contributes about one percent of the @entity43 's energy needs , with around 2000 on and offshore turbines up and running			1
whilst wind is no silver bullet to the energy problem , it can make an important contribution to the equation			2
this is especially true in the @entity43 , which possesses 40 percent of @entity19 's total wind energy			1
the prospects for wind power could be greatly enhanced if cost - effective storage could be implemented			1
some , like @entity67 based @entity66 , are putting their faith in new battery technology			0
but a @entity43 professor , @entity71 thinks he might have found another solution -- storing energy in flexible containers on the ocean floor			1
professor @entity71 's idea of using @entity77 ( @entity77 ) is n't a new one , but his methods are			2
traditionally , @entity77 stows energy in a vast underground reservoir			0
during peak energy hours , air is released powering a turbine , which in turn produces electricity			2
there are currently only two @entity77 sites in the world -- in @entity89 , @entity24 and in @entity90 , @entity91			2
based at @entity95 , professor @entity71 -- whose interest in wind turbines stretches back to his school days -- began his research into compressed air storage two years ago			1
" i was thinking about how textile composites and textile structures might be relevant in the context of renewable energy , " he told @entity2			0
in a moment of inspiration , @entity71 realized that air could be compressed using a wind turbine or a wave - powered device			1
" drawing a mass down within the blade of the piston itself compresses the air , " he said			0
the prospects for his energy storage idea with tidal power are perhaps even better			2
" with tidal power you can use a hydraulic ram			0
this can take a large flow of water at a low pressure			0
out of that it can then give you a small flow of water at a high pressure			0
" naturally , storing vast amounts of air requires vast amounts of storage			0
professor @entity71 envisages a cone - like structure stretching 50 meters wide at the top to around 80 meters across at the base			2
the bags are made of a combination of plastics			0
" a polyester reinforcement at the core with probably a polythene layer around that , " @entity71 said			0
at a depth of around 600 meters , professor @entity71 calculates that the bags would be able to store 25 megajoules of energy for every meter cubed			1
the deep water is essential			0
" only in deep water , where the pressure is greatest , are the bags a good economic proposition , " @entity71 explained			0
although there is an additional cost in fixing reinforcement cables and ballast , @entity71 believes the future economic prospects for his invention are good			0
he plans to put the storage bags through smaller scale land - based tests , with four - meter - diameter bags , to prove that his calculations are right			0
the centrifugal force required to compress the air is too great for small wind turbines to cope with , so much larger turbines will have to be installed for the project to realize its goals			2
currently , wind turbines are situated in relatively shallow water -- around 40 meters			1
so how will the project work if the bags need to be at a depth of 600 meters ? well , a series of pipes will link turbine and bag and professor @entity71 believes the distances , in @entity19 at least , would n't have to be too long			1
research into floating turbines is underway and , as professor @entity71 points out there are steep ocean shelves off the west coast of @entity180 and @entity181 and around the entire periphery of the @entity183			0
" you could put wind turbines on these shelves and within a few hundred meters , or kilometers you could be in 600 - meter - deep water , " he said			2
professor @entity71 , who has secured a three year grant from @entity24 energy provider @entity189 , is confident that with the right funding the @entity43 can achieve its stated aim of providing 20 percent of its energy from renewables by 2020			1
" we 're probably the richest country per head in the world in terms of renewable energy , " he said			0
" but we 're way behind @entity20 , @entity24 and the @entity200			0
" he thinks that the realistic prospect for the future is a combination of nuclear and renewable energy as the best way to reduce carbon emissions quickly			0
the argument against wind power being intermittent and therefore unreliable may dissolve as professor @entity71 continues his research			1
plastic bags in our oceans might prove to be a cause for celebration and make wind power a much more attractive economic proposition than it is today .			1

wind power has the *potential* to become a leading source of energy
three quarters of the world 's wind power is generated in @entity19
wind power is variable -- but one @entity43 professor has devised a way to store it
*system* stores compressed air 600 meters underwater
