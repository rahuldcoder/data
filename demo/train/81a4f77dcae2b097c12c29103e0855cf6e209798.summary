-- in 2009 the first underground cable linking @entity2 to high speed internet access went live			1
the 17,000km long network took two years to complete and came with the promise of boosting the region 's industry and commerce			0
three years later millions of @entity2 now have access to the internet - primarily through 3g services on their mobile phones			1
mobile data offers the most affordable access to the web , and figures from the @entity17 show 31 million @entity2 now have mobile broadband subscriptions			1
there 's no denying the @entity2 internet economy has come a long way			1
but building a sustainable internet infrastructure across a continent of one billion people continues to present major challenges , especially when it comes to connecting rural towns and villages			2
in large urban areas there are lots of ways to get people online , via traditional terrestrial technologies			0
in remote regions , where communities are often cut off , it 's much more difficult for mobile operators to backhaul 3g data affordably			2
so how do you overcome this connectivity challenge ? it seems the answer lies , not with the cables below our feet , but with the skies above			0
" for communities that are really isolated the only reasonable choice is satellite , " said @entity49 the corporate marketing manager for satellite communications firm @entity51			2
" mobile operators are looking to new and different technologies for ways to connect a larger population base -- the chance to connect the unconnected			2
" @entity51 says a growing number of mobile operators are using advanced satellite technology to distribute @entity65 traffic , and are also discovering it 's a viable option for working with more complex data like @entity68			1
the service is already being gradually rolled out in countries including @entity71 and @entity72			0
but is it more cost effective than traditional methods ? until recently the majority of internet coverage had been provided from marco - cells - large electrical base stations , made up of tall lattice towers laden with transmitters and receivers			0
they provide coverage to anyone within a 35 mile radius , but they 're expensive to run			0
companies like @entity51 are promoting an alternative - small - cell technology , which allows mobile operators to backhaul data from sites , no larger than the average satellite dish			1
it 's the ideal solution for mobile operators to reach remote and rural areas , and has been welcomed by @entity97 , the director of policy for the @entity2 and @entity99 branch of the @entity100 , an organization which represents mobile operators worldwide			1
@entity97 says broader internet coverage , will not only connect disengaged businesses and families , but will provide access to educational resources and basic amenities like banking			2
" ultimately , increased mobile connectivity translates into gdp growth and job creation in previously under - served areas			0
for example , broader mobile coverage provides an opportunity for the mobile industry and the financial sector to collaborate to deliver affordable financial services to millions of previously unbanked customers			1
" of course the logistics of connecting millions of rural @entity2 is not the only problem that needs solving			1
even if @entity124 is available in remote towns and villages , will locals be able to afford it ? 10 @entity2 tech voices to follow on @entity129 @entity97 says mobile companies should prioritize driving down prices in order to make @entity133 accessible for as many @entity2 as possible			1
but he says governments are also accountable			0
" they have a really important role to play , " he added			2
" governments across @entity2 are now prioritizing the removal of all taxes on devices and import duties that artificially inflate prices			1
" for example , the 2009 removal of a 16 per cent vat on handsets in @entity72 saw a 200 per cent increase in devices sales and an increase in mobile penetration from 50 per cent to 70 per cent by 2011			2
" @entity49 admits that initially the cost of @entity68 , and the handsets required to run it , will remain prohibitively high for average @entity2			1
but as connectivity spreads , and client bases expand , costs will eventually drop			0
" the type of services they get will tie into what they can afford			0
if you 're talking about spending $ 2/3 a month to get access to services , probably not			0
" but if you 're talking about the $ 10/15 range then yes that could get you access as costs continue to go down			0
" the costs today will be very different to the costs in five years			0

figures show 31 million @entity2 now have mobile broadband subscriptions
satellite technology being used to reach rural @entity2 communities , detached from the internet *revolution*
governments must also play a role in helping to provide affordable handsets and services
