-- most of us do n't know much about @entity3 , the reclusive @entity4 leader who died saturday			1
but thanks to a cult - favorite blog , we do know this : that country 's " @entity3 " spent countless hours visiting stores , factories and plantations and gazing stoically from behind his trademark sunglasses upon various things -- soldiers , machinery , livestock and lots and lots of food			1
the @entity23 - hosted blog , " @entity3 looking at @entity24 , " gathers propaganda photos of the departed dictator from the state - run @entity27 and has built a steady following since it was launched in october 2010			1
the founder of @entity23 , @entity29 , even named it as one of his favorite sites			0
the blog is run by @entity34 , 26 , an art director for a @entity37 , @entity36 design firm			2
@entity34 said monday he has about 375 unposted photos of @entity3 in his archives and is leaning toward keeping the blog going			1
" i do n't have a favorite but i like the ones where he 's smiling the best , " @entity34 wrote in an e-mail to @entity0			0
" there 's a certain humanity in them , i find			0
" in the first 12 hours or so after @entity3 's death was announced , the blog has gotten more than 1.4 million page views , up from an average monthly total of about 500,000 , he said			1
@entity34 has posted a poll on his site 's @entity54 page , asking fans whether he should continue the blog			2
as of monday afternoon he had received more than 3,300 " yes " votes and fewer than 100 " nos. " he said he got the idea for the blog last year after seeing a gallery of similar @entity3 photos on the @entity65 's website			1
@entity34 found the images " just too surreal to be true " and " thought it deserved a blog of its own			2
" with rule of @entity4 expected to pass to @entity3 's son , @entity71 , a copycat blog has already appeared showing similar images of the younger @entity3			1
but @entity34 does n't seem to mind			0
" that 's how the @entity76 works			0
out with the old and in with the new , " he wrote			0
@entity34 does n't think the new blog 's subject carries the same ironic weight , though			0
" you need that absolute evil that @entity3 personified so well to make it funny			2
" @entity3 's bizarre life as pop - culture icon in the 14 months since he launched the blog , @entity34 has posted hundreds of images of @entity4 's dictator , flanked by an ever - present entourage and peering at everything from bubble gum to sausage			1
but asked what , if anything , his blog has revealed about @entity4 and he draws a blank			2
" they have very clean factories is probably the only thing i can say			0
the rest remains a mystery			0

*creator* of popular photo blog about @entity3 says he will likely keep project going

a copycat blog has already appeared showing similar images of @entity71
