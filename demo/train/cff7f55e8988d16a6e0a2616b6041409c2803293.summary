@entity0 -- president @entity2 said sunday that any controversy over his remarks last week that @entity5 - @entity4 negotiations should start from pre- 1967 borders and include land swaps was " not based in substance			1
" in his first speech as president to the main @entity14 - @entity5 advocacy group , the @entity13 ( @entity13 ) , @entity2 sought to reassure the vital @entity14 @entity16 lobby of his administration 's commitment to @entity5 's security while also making clear his desire to kick - start the stalled @entity5 - @entity4 peace talks at a time when the entire @entity24 landscape is changing amid the so - called @entity26 demonstrations			1
@entity2 acknowledged that he expected some controversy from his call last thursday for negotiations to be based on border demarcations from before the six - day war of 1967 , in which @entity5 seized the @entity33 , @entity34 and other territory			1
got questions about the peace process ? share a short video however , he said , his policy on the border issue " means that the parties themselves -- israelis and @entity4 -- will negotiate a border that is different than the one that existed on june 4 , 1967 , " the eve of the war			2
those negotiations will involve " mutually agreed - upon " land swaps to deal with changing conditions of recent decades , he said			1
" that 's what mutually agreed - upon swaps means			0
it is a well - known formula to all who have worked on this issue for a generation , " @entity2 said to applause			2
" it allows the parties themselves to account for the changes that have taken place over the last 44 years , " including the new demographic realities on the ground and the needs of both sides			0
his proposal contained " nothing particularly original , " he said , adding that " this basic framework for negotiations has long been the basis for discussions among the parties , including previous @entity14 administrations			0
" " if there is a controversy , then , it 's not based in substance , " @entity2 said			2
the thursday remarks drew a chilly response from @entity5 prime minister @entity84 , who used a joint appearance with @entity2 on friday to reject any possibility that @entity5 could return to its pre- 1967 borders			1
@entity84 said such borders would be " indefensible " and noted that major @entity5 population centers now lie outside them			0
on sunday , a statement by @entity84 responding to @entity2 's @entity13 speech was more conciliatory , saying : " i share the president 's will to promote peace and i value his current and past efforts to achieve this goal			2
" " i am determined to act together with president @entity2 in order to find ways to resume the negotiations for peace , " @entity84 's statement said			1
" peace is a vital need for all of us			0
" @entity104 , the chief @entity4 representative to the @entity14 , told @entity1 on sunday that his @entity105 also welcomed the @entity14 support for restarting the peace talks			2
at the same time , @entity104 called for concrete steps by @entity5 that showed " they are genuine and sincere about the ending the conflict with us , " instead of what he labeled " nationalist , ideological " slogans and steps such as continuing to expand housing settlements in the @entity33 and @entity113			2
in his speech sunday , @entity2 repeated a line from thursday that the " status quo " in the @entity5 - @entity4 conflict is unsustainable			1
he listed a series of reasons why conditions on the ground dictated the need for a revitalized peace effort now			0
" first , the number of @entity4 living west of the @entity129 is growing rapidly and fundamentally reshaping the demographic realities of both @entity5 and the @entity131 , " @entity2 said			1
" this will make it harder and harder -- without a peace deal -- to maintain @entity5 as both a jewish state and a democratic state			0
" he also cited the increasing difficulty for @entity5 to defend itself against regional enemies , and the " new generation " of @entity140 reshaping the entire region through the protest movement that already has toppled governments in @entity144 and @entity145			0
" a just and lasting peace can no longer be forged with one or two @entity140 leaders			0
going forward , millions of @entity140 citizens have to see that peace is possible for that peace to be sustained , " @entity2 said , adding that a growing regional and international impatience with the @entity5 - @entity4 peace process is leading some to look for other options , such as a @entity152 resolution in september to recognize an independent @entity4 state			1
even though such a @entity152 general assembly resolution would be non-binding , @entity2 told the @entity13 meeting that the @entity14 would oppose any effort to isolate @entity5 in international forums			1
he also repeated @entity14 criticism of @entity161 , the @entity4 group that governs the @entity34 and is considered a terrorist organization by @entity0			1
@entity161 and the other main @entity4 group , the @entity165 party of @entity166 that heads the governing authority in the @entity33 , agreed on may 4 to work together to set up unifying elections in may 2012			2
@entity104 said that under the agreement , @entity165 would continue to negotiate on behalf of the @entity4 until they can elect their own leaders and representatives next year			0
" hopefully , come may 2012 , the @entity4 people will be able to choose those people who are committed to negotiating a peaceful resolution with @entity5 , " @entity104 said , conceding that @entity161 would be a voice in any @entity4 unity government that emerges from next year 's vote			2
@entity2 said @entity5 can not be expected to negotiate with @entity161 until it renounces violence and recognizes @entity5 's right to exist as a jewish state			0
the audience applauded loudly when @entity2 called for @entity161 to release @entity182 , an @entity5 soldier captured five years ago			0
in response , @entity161 spokesman @entity184 told @entity1 that the @entity14 government has " a clear preference for @entity5 " at the expense of freedom for the @entity4 people and their right to establish a sovereign state			1
in the @entity14 , political opponents criticized @entity2 for what they described as harming @entity5 's negotiating position with the @entity4			1
@entity197 presidential hopeful @entity196 labeled the @entity2 policy a " disaster " and " extraordinarily dangerous " in an appearance sunday on the @entity201 program " @entity202			0
" " a president who ca n't control his own border probably should n't lecture @entity5 about their border , " @entity204 said			0
while a few boos and groans were heard in the @entity13 crowd when @entity2 raised the border issue sunday , he received consistent applause throughout the speech and a vigorous standing ovation at the end			0
in @entity5 , about 150 right - wing activists protested sunday against @entity2 's policy in front of the @entity220 in @entity221 , with some bearing slogans that declared : " @entity2 , @entity5 are not willing to commit suicide			1
