-- @entity1 gets a lot of attention for being , uh , your space -- a handful of entry fields in which to sum up your awesomeness , right down to the bewildering " write something about yourself " box			1
researchers fixate on what your profile says about you , while increasingly complex pages , plug - ins and boxes ( what are those all about , anyway ? ) make it clear that @entity1 is all about you			1
still , at least one tab of your @entity1 profile is largely left to others ' devices : the wall			1
here , controlled chaos reigns as friends and sometimes even strangers add uncensored commentary to your digital persona			0
the wall 's a totally bizarre concept , if you think about it : you 're writing a message to your friend , but instead of getting it to him directly ( hey , the " send message " button is right there ) , you post a thought for the world to see			1
it 's an opportunity for your friends to showcase their wit , trot out inside jokes and flirt publicly			2
it 's also an opportunity for your pals to completely screw you over			2
when it comes to interacting on the @entity1 , we suggest you cease and desist with the following : boneheaded move : dirtying up a friend 's wall just because you are wise enough to say " no " to friend requests from your @entity53 , your former co-worker and your little cousin @entity55 does n't mean the same is true of your friends			1
swearing or making mention of a friend 's questionable ( or even questionably legal ) early - morning decisions on his or her wall is just as unclassy as her 3 a.m. dip into the never - dry pool of bad decisions			1
yeah , your bud might don an uber - short denim romper and cuss up a storm in a @entity69 cover band on the weekends , but let her be the gatekeeper of that intel			0
boneheaded move : " liking " your friend 's sob story your journo friend wrote a heartbreaking article about a passel of homeless kittens being drowned at the local shelter			1
the headline is " @entity81 in @entity82			0
" admiring your friend 's grabby lede and use of alliteration , you click to give the article a thumbs - up			1
in fact , you " like " it			0
you sick animal - hating freak , you			0
let 's try another one			0
your friend writes a lengthy and hilarious note about his hapless tuesday , complete with food poisoning , an awkward run - in with an ex at the used bookstore and an uninsured visit to the hospital after a precarious light fixture gave up hanging by its cord and crashed onto his cranium			0
you , appreciative of the comedic tone and spot - on delivery , " like " the description of said friend 's terrible , horrible , no - good , very bad day			1
look , if a status update is n't overtly cheerful , skip straight to a pleasant comment , ok ? or just buy homeboy a beer			0
that , he 'll really " like			0
" boneheaded move : blowing an announcement oh em gee , oh em gee , @entity117 finally proposed to his girlfriend ! oh em gee , oh em gee , you must immediately share your opinion that it 's about damn time , and even though you do n't believe in marriage as an institution , you are pumped for the celebration and hope he 'll consider letting your glam rock glittered - out indie band play at the reception ! sans further ado , you rush to the book of faces , fingers aflutter , and hit the caps - lock key before filling in a long and detailed wall post , full of much congratulations and merriment			1
except that @entity117 has n't made this announcement himself yet , and he and his fianc√©e are feverishly calling up dozens of loved ones and convincing each that he or she is very first to hear the good news			1
now the remaining handful of vips make the discovery at the same time as the mouth - breathing masses , thanks to your @entity147 wall post			2
@entity117 's friends and relatives are pissed at him , @entity117 's pissed at you , and you sure as hell ai n't getting the wedding - band gig that would almost certainly send you soaring toward a record deal and indie rock stardom			2
all because you could n't keep your mouth shut			0
this goes for bad news , as well : major life events such as train wreck - like break - ups , unforeseen job losses and the tragic deaths of beloved pet parakeets are best announced by he who is most personally affected			0
the simple fix : send a @entity1 message instead			2
you could also try an e-mail or even ( gasp ! ) pick up the telephone , but we know interpersonal communication is about as passe as those chill beach - rock beats your band was pumping out six months ago .			0

swearing or making mention of a friend 's questionable *behavior* on his or her wall is unclassy
do n't blow a friend 's major announcement by putting it on @entity1 before they do
" liking " a friend 's sob story could make you look like a jerk , even if you 're *kidding*
