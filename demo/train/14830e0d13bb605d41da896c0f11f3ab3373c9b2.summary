-- @entity1 believes when it comes to the power of the federal government , he is just a small fish caught up in a prosecution meant for corporations			1
and the @entity8 thought enough of his appeal to hear the matter later this year			1
the justices agreed on monday to take up the case in which prosecutors used a law typically applied to corporate records to convict @entity1 of getting rid of three illegally caught grouper			1
the question is whether the law against obstructing an investigation into business practices is too vague			1
it was passed in the aftermath of @entity23 and other big scandals of that kind			0
the actual legal language in dispute involves efforts to conceal , cover up , falsify , or make a false entry in any record , document , or tangible object			0
@entity1 , 61 , owns the @entity33 , a commercial fishing vessel moored near @entity35 , @entity36			1
it was operating off the @entity38 in 2007 when she was boarded by state officers working with the @entity40			0
they discovered 72 undersized red grouper , and told @entity1 to leave the catch there , and head back to shore so agents could seize it			1
when the @entity33 @entity33 arrived at port days later , a government inspector counted only 69 fish that were below the 20 - inch minimum harvesting size			0
@entity1 still claims the deputy originally miscounted the fish			0
prosecutors alleged @entity1 had ordered his crew to throw the smaller fish overboard , and charged him with destruction of evidence to impede a federal investigation			1
a jury eventually convicted the @entity62 man and he spent 30 days in jail			2
the @entity64 said @entity1 does not dispute now that he " directed the destruction or concealment of the fish " but argues that the law used to prosecute him does not apply			2
@entity1 says the conviction has hurt him economically and wonders why the government was so insistent they " have a pound flesh " by prosecuting him for what he called a simple civil infraction			0
the justices will not retry the facts , but only will consider whether the law was properly applied			2
a number of legal and political advocacy groups have rallied to @entity1 ' cause , saying " misuse " of government discretion to use criminal law rather than civil law to handle a range of regulatory enforcement is hurting the justice system			2
" @entity91 by any branch of government steps on the rights of all @entity95 , whether on our country 's street corners or our nation 's boardrooms , " said @entity87 , representing the @entity88 , which filed an amicus brief in the case			0
" the case is @entity1 v. @entity95 ( 13 - 7451 ) .			0

@entity36 *fisherman* convicted under law *crafted* for corporate prosecutions
he was caught with illegal grouper and got rid of three of them
prosecutors not backing down , but @entity8 will *decide* if they went too far
