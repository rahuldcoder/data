-- crime fiction fans know the name @entity3 , a single - named anti-hero of the 1960s			1
as a character , he 's a career criminal , hired gun and professional thief , a pulp - fiction prince of @entity11 's seedy underworld			1
he 's relentless and menacing with steely good looks			2
imagine a hard - boiled @entity13 with a gun			2
@entity3 made his debut in 1962 in @entity17 's " @entity16			1
" but @entity17 was a pseudonym of legendary author @entity17 , who continued writing about @entity3 's criminal exploits in more than two dozen books until his death in 2008			1
the character has long enjoyed cult classic status and found varying success on the big screen , portrayed by actors including @entity27 and @entity28			2
more recently , @entity3 has found new life in a series of imaginative and stylish graphic novels from @entity33 - winning artist and writer @entity34			1
comic fans recognize @entity34 from his past success in the superhero genre , putting his own creative spin on icons like @entity40 , @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
in re-imagining @entity3 -- starting with " @entity16 " in 2009 , followed by " @entity44 " and now " @entity45 " -- @entity34 has stayed incredibly faithful to @entity17 's original novels			1
he describes his adaptations as being like noir movies on paper			2
in " the score , " @entity34 works in a lean palette of black , white and gold			1
his bold pen strokes , moody washes of color , and lean prose help the action pop off the page			2
once again , @entity3 has become a hit critically and financially			1
@entity34 is already working on a fourth graphic novel , with a fifth planned			1
@entity0 caught up with the artist and author as he prepared to debut " @entity45 " for fans at @entity65 in @entity66			1
we spoke to him at his home in @entity69 by phone			2
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : what drew you to @entity3 originally ? @entity34 : i 've always been a big fan of crime fiction			1
when i was young i started reading a lot of the classics like @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 , @entity82 -- i could go on and on			2
at that time the @entity3 novels were out of print , but i happened to see the @entity27 film " @entity88 , " which is one of my favorite movies , and realized later that it came from the @entity3 books			1
so i started haunting secondhand book shops and picking up the @entity3 novels and just completely fell in love with them			1
i thought they were the perfect crime novels , at least for me			1
so it 's been kind of a 30 - year love affair with the books			1
@entity0 : describe how you put " @entity45 " together			0
@entity34 : the first thing i do is create a working script out of a copy of the novel			1
i read " @entity45 " six or seven times , and as i 'm passing through it , i 'm making notes , highlighting scenes , maybe breaking a chapter down , writing down a visual cue , cutting out things that are extraneous			0
then i sit down and start laying it out visually			0
i 'm able to follow the novel very much like a script			0
i never type a script for @entity3			1
i end up handwriting in pencil onto the art board right out of the novel			0
at that point , i start combing over it again			0
i 'll start playing with scenes , maybe if i shuffle the order i get a more unexpected result			0
the process leading up to me sitting down at the art board can be as long as a year			0
then i sit down at the table and it 's about a four - month process			1
when i work on @entity3 , that 's all i do			1
i just immerse myself in it			0
@entity0 : how did you adapt your style for the @entity3 novels ? @entity34 : i felt there was a certain fit there			1
i definitely did go out of my way to make what i was doing to complement the material			0
when @entity17 wrote the books , he did so under a pen name , @entity17			1
the name really describes the approach and the style of prose			0
so i took that as my cue			0
i tried to strip out a lot of things you would see in my more mainstream work , a lot of the details , the line work ; i tried to break it down more into shapes and blocks of color			0
i did n't want to do black and white , but i knew full color was very expensive and would n't have been appropriate			0
i thought a one color approach was the perfect way to go			0
it allows you to get that black and white , film noir feeling from the images , but you have enough color there to give them some depth , sparkle and life that it would n't have otherwise			0
i really try to create it in the spirit it was written			0
@entity0 : this is your third @entity3 adaptation			1
have you changed your approach over the series ? @entity34 : i 'm trying to stay open to different ways to tell the story but remain incredibly faithful to the novels while i do it			1
there is some room for visual interpretation , but it 's a balancing act			2
in " @entity45 " one of the main characters is @entity3 's pal , @entity185			1
in the novel , @entity17 describes him as an actor who always hears music in his head			1
@entity190 hears background music to whatever it is he 's doing , he 's always dramatizing what he 's doing			2
i picked up on that and all the scenes with @entity185 start out like movie scenes featuring the kind of music he 's hearing in his head as they go about this crime			2
someone else will speak and the bubble pops and then we 're into the reality of the situation			0
it 's a great cue every time that @entity190 comes on stage in the book			2
when we see the musical notes , the reader knows , ok , we 're in @entity190 's head now			2
it 's something you can carry forward			2
@entity0 : what was it like to work with author @entity17 ? @entity34 : we had a pleasant communication together through e-mail			1
he was really generous with his time with me			0
in order for the project to go forward , he had to approve it			0
he really did n't at first			0
i think he eventually saw that we were n't interested in taking @entity3 and doing what we wanted with him			2
we were very interested in having him show us what he thought this could be or should be and taking it from there			0
at that point he definitely started to get more excited about it			0
the thing that really sold it , he asked me a few questions about how i planned to write it			0
i e-mailed back , " i do n't plan on writing anything if i can help it			0
i plan on using your words wherever possible			0
that 's the reason i 'm going to do the stories in the year they were written , so that i do n't have to rewrite your stories to accommodate cell phones or all the other things that have happened in the world			2
i want your words on the page			0
" i think he really appreciated that			0
of course i wish he had lived to see this , because i think he would have been delighted			0
i know his family has been very happy about all of this			0
we 're really proud of the books and what they 're doing for @entity17 's legacy			1
