@entity0 , @entity1 -- the sense of security that @entity1 had enjoyed for almost 60 years was shattered one year ago , when the @entity5 launched an attack on the civilian island of @entity8 , killing two marines and two civilians			1
grainy images from surveillance cameras that captured the moment when some 170 rounds of artillery pounded the island , causing villagers to run for their lives , were a stark reminder for many that the two @entity21 still remain at war			2
with a sense of normalcy returning to the island as villagers return home , most @entity1 have bounced back from the incident -- which escalated tensions to their highest since the @entity29 was halted in 1953 after an armistice treaty was signed			1
but have @entity1 forgotten about the threat ? many remember the day of the attack			1
@entity34 , 30 , was a student at the time and received a text message from her friend that read : " get your things together			0
it looks like war is going to break out			0
" " i think for most people it was the moment when that sense of fear suddenly kicked in			0
not thinking about living in a divided country and all of sudden , you 're thinking , war could actually happen , " says @entity48			0
what stunned many @entity1 was not only the fact that @entity55 could direct its aggression upon civilians , but that they were unprepared			1
" there was a lot of talk at the time about the power shift in @entity63 and how @entity64 had designated an heir			2
but in reality what really mattered was the fact that we were n't prepared at all for something that happened in that one moment , " says @entity48			0
the attack was a wake - up call for the @entity1 government			1
it launched the largest civil defense drill in history shortly after the attack and urged people to be more proactive and aware of potential threats from @entity55			2
the island shelling had also come half a year after @entity63 torpedoed a naval ship , the @entity83 , killing 46 sailors			1
consequently , the past 12 months have seen relations between the two foes deteriorate			0
@entity63 expert @entity87 calls the past year " a power struggle " between the two @entity21			2
" what @entity1 want is to not cave in and forgive @entity63 for what it did last year , but they also understand in order to prevent such provocations from happening again , there needs to be a sense of dialog and negotiation , " @entity87 , a professor at the @entity89 , says			1
both @entity5 and @entity1 have shown signs of concession -- @entity55 has expressed willingness to engage with countries involved in multilateral talks aimed at @entity63 's denuclearization , while @entity0 recently sent humanitarian aid through @entity108 agencies to help the malnourished population in the @entity5			1
however , if relations do n't improve on the peninsula soon , @entity0 could potentially be looking at a prickly neighbor willing to use its long - range missiles next year , according to @entity87			0
" if the trust level between @entity5 and @entity1 continue to be as low as it is , there is the possibility that @entity55 will go for more sensitive and strategically important targets , " adds the professor			1
the threat of another attack like @entity8 may unnerve many @entity1 , but some have already recovered the positive sentiment they had before the island attack occurred			1
" i think most people believe something like that could never happen in @entity0			0
there seems to be this vague belief that questions the plausibility of such an act , " @entity0 businessman @entity130 says			0
" no , i do n't think that could happen , is what the majority of people think , including myself , " he adds			0
" it 's probably because we 've always co-existed with @entity63 's provocations that we do n't really perceive the threats from it , " says 40 - year - old office worker @entity139			2
" it just does n't seem relevant to my life			0

the @entity8 attack escalated @entity1 tensions to their highest since 1953
the island shelling came half a year after @entity63 torpedoed a naval ship
many @entity1 were stunned that @entity55 directed its aggression upon civilians
