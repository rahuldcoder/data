@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 wo n't ever forget the day her son posed a question that stopped her in her tracks			1
" @entity8 , " the fourth - grader asked , " am i white ? " it was a question she had never asked her own parents			1
it was something you did n't talk about in the days of the segregated @entity13 -- especially when your mom was white and your father was a mix of @entity18 and @entity17			1
she went to the black schools of @entity0 , @entity1			1
now , her son was asking probing questions			1
" why would you ask me that ? " she said			1
" because everybody at school calls me a honky , " said the young @entity23 , a light - skinned @entity18			1
twenty - seven years have passed since that conversation			1
@entity3 and her son recently traveled back to @entity0 to face something that 's been omnipresent their whole lives : the coming together of white and black			1
they returned for a one - of - a - kind 50th high school gathering			1
the classes of 1959 , once segregated by race as well as gender , sat down together for the first time in history			1
@entity40 arrived two hours early for the festivities			1
she did n't sleep the night before			1
" it 's like waiting for @entity43 to arrive			1
i 'm so excited , " said @entity40 , who drove more than 330 miles from @entity44 to attend			1
@entity40 went to @entity45 , the city 's black high school , whose most famous students include singers @entity48 and @entity50			1
she came this day " to celebrate and commemorate			2
" " i could not pass this event up , " she said			2
" i never dreamed of this moment -- just the realization of knowing that we had come together , at last			1
" as the 1959 graduates arrived , they welcomed one another			1
many first greeted people of their own race			2
some had n't seen particular classmates in the 50 years since they earned their diplomas			2
gradually , they began mixing and mingling			2
there was a commonality -- a need to come together for their children , their grandchildren and the generations to follow			2
discuss the past , while moving forward in the present			1
separated now by ' personal choice ' it sometimes takes a son to see things in a new light			2
the idea for the meeting began four years ago , when a son told his father : " @entity80 , think about how many friends you missed getting to know			2
" those were the words of @entity84 , a public school teacher in @entity85 , @entity86			2
he and his father , @entity87 , were enjoying a father - son trip to @entity0 in 2005 to rediscover their roots			1
@entity87 is the former head of @entity2 and was once the publisher of the @entity92			2
he 's traveled the world and left his own mark along the way			1
yet despite all his accomplishments , there was something he 'd never done : reach out to the african - americans of @entity0 from 1959 , the ones he never knew because of segregation			1
he wrote to graduates of the black school , @entity105 ; the white girls ' school , @entity107 ; and the white boys ' school , @entity109			2
" we all have deep personal memories of our high school experiences that will remain with us forever , " he wrote			2
" we had lived in a separate black and white world in @entity0			1
... it is a different world today			2
we no longer are separated , except by personal choice			2
" one white graduate responded with hate mail , a reminder that racism still exists			2
but on a day in early october , more than 200 people gathered at a @entity122 banquet hall			2
there was no shouting , none of the in - your - face name - calling seen in recent health care town hall meetings across the country			2
here , there were tears , hugs and handshakes			0
often , talk of grandkids took center stage at the 16 roundtables			0
they talked about race and the segregated past that prevented such closeness a half - century ago			1
" you 'd think we 'd have grown up together , " said @entity143 , a @entity105 - @entity105 grad			0
" we still have a gift , and that 's a gift of time , " @entity87 said			0
" blacks and whites together , we can do something to make the world better			0
" they took out notepads			0
they scribbled ways to take action			0
they began making a to - do list of 59 things for the @entity160 of 1959			1
their goals range from building a home for @entity164 to @entity165 to writing letters to service men and women from @entity0 serving in war			1
they 'd love to persuade the one who sent the hate mail to attend the next gathering			0
they also want to set an example for the elders of other @entity13 cities			1
" i 'm glad we 've left the past behind , " said @entity178 , the 1959 class president of @entity109			1
the daughter of one those in attendance stood and took the microphone			0
" today , you have inspired me so much , " she said			0
many in the crowd reached for tissues			0
@entity188 said her whole life had been leading to this moment			1
" it was the most amazing thing , " she said			0
" it was just like almost immediate bonding between people			0
" as the class president of @entity107 , she 'd carried guilt for the last 50 years for not speaking out against segregation			0
" i have tears about this , " she said , crying			0
for @entity3 and her son , the gathering underscored why the question " @entity8 , am i white " could be asked in one era and not another			0
listening to his mother and her childhood friends , @entity23 said , he was struck by how segregation was " was so transparent to them at the time they were living through it			0
it was a way of life , so they did n't acknowledge its existence			0
" " i find it interesting how human nature teaches you to accept things that are -- and some people question the reality , and other people do n't			0
" his mother did test the reality of segregation on one occasion			0
@entity3 and her sister went into a @entity229 's department store in @entity0			1
they sat at a counter for food			0
the white waitress looked at them skeptically			0
she could n't tell whether they were white or black			0
she grabbed a black cook for his input			0
" those are the @entity239 girls , " he said			0
the two were kicked out			0
@entity241 giggles about the story			0
she 's proud she tried to break the rules			0
" i think she really would 've served us if she thought she could have gotten away with it			1
" watch @entity3 tell story of her dad and ' stupid ' @entity250 it was in 1963 when @entity241 realized just how wrong the segregated @entity13 was			1
she marched in @entity252 , with @entity253 that year			0
" it was almost like you were listening to @entity256 speak in person			0
" years later , @entity3 -- the girl who was sent away from the @entity229 's counter -- would eat @entity260 dinner with president @entity261			0
@entity241 was the music teacher for @entity262 , the president 's daughter			0
her motto throughout life : " just do the very best you can			0
" she calls the gathering of the segregated schools " unbelievable			1
" if it 's the last trip of her life , @entity241 , 68 , feels her life 's journey is now complete			0
" i was glad to meet new friends today			1
" a special thanks to @entity274 for its help on this report .			0

students from former segregated schools of 1959 unite in @entity0 , @entity1
" i never dreamed of this moment , " says @entity40
@entity178 : " i 'm glad we 've left the past behind "
the group hopes to set example for elders of other @entity13 cities
