-- a @entity3 satellite has observed a rapid retreat of one of @entity7 's ice shelves , which is half the size it was 10 years ago , the @entity1 said thursday			1
the agency 's @entity11 satellite shows part of the @entity14 , which lies on a peninsula south of @entity16 , has decreased from 3,463 square kilometers ( 1,337 square miles ) in march 2002 to 1,670 square kilometers ( 645 square miles ) today , a change the @entity1 blames on warmer temperatures			1
" ice shelves are sensitive to atmospheric warming and to changes in ocean currents and temperatures , " @entity19 from the @entity20 said in an statement from the space agency			0
" the northern @entity27 has been subject to atmospheric warming of about 2.5 degrees @entity29 ( 4.5 fahrenheit degrees ) over the last 50 years -- a much stronger warming trend than on global average , causing retreat and disintegration of ice shelves			0
" the waning is happening on the @entity14 ice shelf , one of three shelves that make up the @entity14			1
@entity14 disintegrated in january 1995			1
@entity14 has so far been stable , the space agency said , though satellites have observed some recent thinning and melting			2
@entity14 measured 11,512 square kilometers in january 1995			0
it went down to 6,664 square kilometers in february 2002 after several parts broke off , and a month later @entity14 was down to 3,463 square kilometers			2
the space agency says the satellite 's observations confirm the vulnerability of the ice shelves to climatic warming .			0

the @entity14 ice shelf has decreased *dramatically* since march 2002
the @entity1 blames it on warmer temperatures
another @entity14 ice shelf disintegrated and a third is stable
