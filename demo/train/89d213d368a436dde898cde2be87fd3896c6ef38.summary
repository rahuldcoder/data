-- in the wake of the shooting rampage at the @entity3 on monday that left 13 dead , we have seen the resurrection of an all - too - familiar debate : did violent video games make the killer do it ? reports suggest that the gunman , @entity11 , played quite a bit of violent video games			1
friends have said to reporters that his heavy game use , described as up to 16 hours at a time , may help explain his actions			0
just as quickly , video game fans have jumped to defend the violent first - person shooting games			2
" @entity23 for monday 's @entity24 " said the headline of an @entity22 op - ed. the problem is that people are looking for a yes - or - no answer about the role of video games in violence , when there is none			1
violent video games alone likely did n't cause @entity11 to go on his rampage			1
but these games are n't harmless , either			1
recent reports suggest he may have been mentally ill and had anger control issues			0
but it is n't hard to believe that video game use may have been a contributing factor			2
my colleagues and i found that typical college students who played violent video games for 20 minutes at a time for three consecutive days showed increasingly higher levels of aggressive behavior each day they played			1
if that 's what happens to typical college students , how might someone like @entity11 react to playing for 16 straight hours ? what if he does this for months or years ? other researchers have found similar results			2
my colleagues and i conducted a comprehensive review of 136 articles reporting 381 effects involving over 130,000 participants around the world			0
these studies show that violent video games increase aggressive thoughts , angry feelings , physiological arousal ( e.g. , heart rate , blood pressure ) , and aggressive behavior			1
violent games also decrease helping behavior and feelings of empathy for others			1
the effects occurred for males and females of all ages , regardless of what country they lived in			0
despite the evidence , many people still deny violent media effects for a variety of reasons that i summarized in a @entity85 piece			0
@entity11 was not the first mass killer to have an obsession with violent video games			1
@entity88 , who killed 26 children in an elementary school in @entity91 , @entity92 , was also said to be a fan of first - person shooting games			0
other killers have been found to be avid players			0
the effects of these games go beyond making players more aggressive			2
in our research , we found that people who played first - person shooting games were more accurate than others when firing a realistic gun at a mannequin -- and more likely to aim for and hit the head			0
police have n't released details of the @entity3 shootings , but it is possible that @entity11 was a more accurate shooter because of the time he spent playing video games			1
that 's an inconvenient fact that you do n't often hear defenders of the games talk about			0
but the argument i hear most often is that video games ca n't be dangerous because millions of people play these games without becoming violent			1
no doubt , most players do n't become violent			2
that 's because they come from good homes , are n't victims of bullying , do n't have mental health issues , and do n't have many of the other risk factors for violence			0
but what about players who already are predisposed to violence ? killers like @entity11 are n't typical			1
they have a lot going against them , such as mental illness			0
violent video games are just one more factor that may be pushing them toward violence			1
we do n't have a lot of control over many of the factors that can contribute to violent behavior			2
but we have some control over violent video games			1
we can make it more difficult to get access to them			0
we can strengthen our laws against teens acquiring these games			0
parents can keep the games out of their homes and help their children avoid them at friends ' houses			0
as a society , we should do all we can to make violent rampages like the one in @entity162 less likely , even if we ca n't stop them entirely			2
controlling the use of violent video games is one step we can take to help protect our society from violence			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity170 .			0
