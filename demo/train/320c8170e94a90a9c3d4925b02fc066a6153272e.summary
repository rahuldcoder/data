@entity0 -- an energized electorate inspired by a groundbreaking election and expectations as high as @entity5 had grown accustomed to greeting him with spontaneous chants of " yes we can			1
" he promised to take " bold , swift action " on the ailing economy and break the partisan grip on @entity0 by ending what he called " petty grievances and false promises			1
" @entity17 proclaims an end to ' petty grievances ' " there are some who question the scale of our ambitions , who suggest that our system can not tolerate too many big plans , " the president told the nation during his inaugural address in 2009			1
" their memories are short , for they have forgotten what this country has already done			0
" this high bar assured there would be a very long to - do - list , and some @entity36 were quick to publicly admit they would not make his job easy			1
but some political observers make the case that pushing a lot of promises was a necessity for an unproven freshman senator			1
" he really needed to prove himself to a lot of individual @entity55 constituencies , " said @entity46 , the creator and editor of @entity48 , an online site best known for rating the truth in campaign advertisements			1
" he made dozens and dozens of small but very narrow promises			2
" @entity48 evaluated 508 promises and concluded that the president has kept 37 % of them , compromised on 14 % of them , has broken 16 % of them , has gotten stalled on 10 % of them and 22 % are still " in the works			1
" it 's all detailed in the online site 's @entity66 scorecard			0
one big stumble came soon after the president took office			2
during an interview on the @entity73 program " @entity74 , " @entity17 had said he intended to " close @entity76 " and vowed to " follow through on that			1
" but legal hurdles and resistance in @entity79 neutralized his executive order to close the detention facility within a year			0
@entity17 signs order to close @entity76 facility another promise that ran into a wall on @entity86 was the vow to repeal @entity89 - era tax cuts for the very rich			1
and with homeowners trying to recover from a crippling mortgage crisis , especially in states such as @entity93 and @entity94 , a promised $ 10 billion dollar foreclosure prevention fund never materialized			2
" he made some really sweeping promises about changing the culture of @entity0 , about bringing the parties together , about being more transparent in how he runs the @entity101 , " @entity46 said			1
" he ran into trouble there			0
there 's been a real realization on the part of the @entity101 that some of the things he said during the 2008 campaign were just not realistic given the way @entity0 really works			1
" immigration reform advocates urge @entity17 to take action the very long list goes on : no comprehensive immigration reform			1
no cap and trade system that regulates pollution emissions			0
some of these broken promises provide critics with plenty of fodder to argue he has been ineffective			1
but the @entity101 views his bucket of promises as half - full			0
" do n't ask do n't tell , " the policy that banned openly gays and lesbians from serving in the military , repealed			0
repeal of ' do n't ask , do n't tell ' seen as ' tipping point ' in gay rights movement the @entity133 also gives the president a thumbs up on national security			0
in 2008 while visiting @entity138 , the president vowed to end the war in @entity140			2
" my goal is to no longer have @entity143 troops engaged in combat in @entity140			0
" that promise was fulfilled in december			0
added to that is that the conflict in @entity148 is winding down and the world 's most - wanted terrorist , @entity149 , is dead			0
" the death of @entity149 marks the most significant achievement to date in our nation 's effort to defeat @entity160 " the president said as he broke the news in a hastily arranged late - night sunday address to the nation in may 2011			0
between now and @entity162 , it 's possible other promises stuck in the works could go either way , although campaigning has consumed much of the oxygen			0
@entity46 said there is plenty of blame to go around			2
@entity79 has created some impassable barriers but at the same time , he argues other promises were " low - hanging fruit " that the president could have accomplished through executive action but so far has n't delivered			2
packed arena cheers @entity178 's speech full coverage of the @entity180			0
