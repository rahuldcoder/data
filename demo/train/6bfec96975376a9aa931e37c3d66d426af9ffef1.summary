@entity0 was still adjusting to being a new mom when she read a magazine article that changed her life			1
" it was about a mother who decided to give her child up for adoption because she could n't stand to hear her crying from hunger , " @entity0 remembered			1
" i just thought that no mother should ever be faced with that choice			2
" it can cost close to $ 250,000 to raise a child in the @entity13 , according to the @entity13 @entity14 -- and that is just for the basics			0
it 's especially tough for families in @entity19 , where one in eight people struggle to make ends meet			2
the following day , @entity0 called her " mom friends " and started collecting gently used baby items			1
" i had the intention , originally , of finding a local organization to donate them to that would benefit my neighbors , " said @entity0 , 34			1
when she did not find what she was looking for , @entity0 's idea for @entity29 was born			1
since 2011 , the nonprofit has distributed diapers , clothing , nursing supplies and other baby essentials for hundreds of infants and toddlers in @entity19			1
" so many people have such an abundance , and so many others strive to afford even the basics , " @entity0 said			1
" what we 're doing is trying to bridge that gap			0
" a fair start in life moms helping @entity48 started with one garage sale that @entity0 held at her home -- except everything was free			1
the drive was a success , and she met many mothers in need and many mothers who wanted to help her build the organization			2
today , @entity0 and her volunteers solicit donations of new or gently used baby items in their neighborhoods			1

for families like @entity78 's , the drives are not just about getting free baby gear			1
they provide an opportunity to get financially back on their feet			0
" new clothes , diapers and wipes , they 're a constant expense , " @entity78 said			2

she recently left her job to devote more time to her group 's efforts			0
" every child deserves all the same things in life			0
they deserve all of the basics , " @entity0 said			2
" if what we 're doing helps bridge the gap between people from different socioeconomic backgrounds , even in a small way , then it 's definitely worth all the hard work			0
