-- here 's what we know about saturday 's crash landing of @entity4 and some of the key questions raised by those facts : 1			2
based on the debris field , the aircraft appears to have struck the rock sea wall well before the start of the runway			1
there are some marks on the sea wall , consistent with an impact of some part of the plane			0
some aircraft debris ended up in the water			1
what we do n't know : did the flight crew simply land the aircraft short ? 2			2
passengers onboard the aircraft describe the engines spooling up and the nose tilting up just before impact , and a preliminary review of the flight data and cockpit voice recorders appear to show the pilots attempted to abort the landing 1.5 seconds before impact			1
the debris field runs from the water , slightly right of the paved threshold and runway center , all the way to the stopped aircraft fuselage			1
the @entity40 lost its tail section , including vertical and horizontal stabilizers , near the end of the paved threshold , just before the start of the runway			0
what we do n't know : is this an indication the tail of the aircraft detached after first impact ? 4			2
what appears to be the @entity40 's right engine is detached from the wing and wedged against the right side of the fuselage			0
another engine is a considerable distance from the fuselage in a grassy area to the right of runway @entity63			0
this appears to be the left engine			0
girls killed in crash were headed for camp what we do n't know : when did the engines detach ? given the debris on the right side of the runway , could the engine off to the side actually be the right engine ? 5			1
a preliminary reading of the flight data and voice data recorders show the 777 was traveling well below the target approach speed of 137 knots , the @entity78 said			1
flight tracking records show that the @entity4 flight descended from cruising altitude much more steeply and rapidly than previous @entity88 flights on the same route			0
the instrument landing system approach on runway @entity63 was not working on the day of the crash			2
it had been down for some time			0
flights were landing using visual flight rules			2
the runway 's precision approach path indicator lights , showing correct flight approach altitudes , were working			0
most of the fire damage to the aircraft occurred after the 777 came to a stop on its belly			2
passengers described the cabin interior as heavily damaged , with overhead bins dropping and at least one life raft / escape slide inflating inside the aircraft , trapping a flight attendant , who was freed by passengers			1
