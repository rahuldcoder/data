-- it 's already capable of carrying more passengers than any other commercial aircraft , but the @entity4 could be about to squeeze in a few extra			1
in a move that adds a dose of economic reality to airline dreams of luxuriously pimped superjumbos , the plane 's manufacturer says that next week it will unveil a new 11 - seat - row economy - class configuration			1
by raising the three seats next to each window a few inches to take advantage of extra fuselage space , @entity4 says it will create enough room to accommodate five people in the middle of the plane			1
while the prospect of spending a long haul flight stuck in the middle seat might be unappealing for passengers , @entity4 says it makes sense for airline revenues			2
" several customers are saying they are interested in looking at ways of making the aircraft more productive , " @entity4 spokesman @entity28 tells @entity0			1
@entity32 , editor of @entity34 magazine , says the new configuration indicates that financial realities are catching up with airlines , which once promised to fill their @entity38 with casinos and double beds			2
he says sales of the @entity44 manufacturer 's flagship have been disappointing since the plane was launched in october 2007			0
" with the price of fuel going up so much , the focus for airlines is economizing and trying to get as many passengers as possible into an aircraft , " he tells @entity0			0
raised capacity @entity28 says the extra seats , which wo n't compromise on the existing 18 - inch width of current chairs , would raise economy - class capacity by 7 %			1
this would mean 30 more seats in a standard cabin layout , but even when full would put the @entity4 well short of its maximum load capacity			1
" the middle seats will be the last ones filled , " he says , adding that the center seats could prove popular with families			0
@entity4 declined to reveal which airlines were pushing for increased capacity , but says 11 - seat mockups will go on display at the @entity70 in @entity71 , @entity72 , from april 8 - 10			2
@entity32 says that while few passengers will rush to claim the center seats , there will be no significant increase in discomfort			0
" the drawback of any five - seat block is , if you are in the middle , you 've always got two people to climb over , but you 've already got that if you 're in the window seat of a block of three , " he says			0
" ultimately it is the airline 's decision -- they have to get the balance between adding seat capacity and what the passengers will put up with			0
" if you pack in too many it becomes claustrophobic and that could have a detrimental affect on the airline			0
