-- what would be the most sensible way for a city to make use of its old and disused metro stations ? maybe they could be given a lick of paint and put back into service			1
or how about rebranding them to drag in tourists with ghoulish yarns of haunted catacombs ? in the @entity16 capital of @entity17 , one mayoral candidate has raised the possibility of sprucing up a station that has lain idle since 1939 with elaborate swimming pools , nightclubs and art installations			1
see also : @entity24 's multi-story luxury basements @entity25 , the center - right candidate of the @entity27 party , has commissioned a series of arresting illustrations displaying how @entity30 , one of the city 's so - called ghost metro stops , could be used			1
if she becomes mayor , @entity34 - @entity25 has said she will ask @entity36 for their own ideas on how to transform the vacant the subterranean spaces			0
alongside the aquatic and artistic options , which have been created by the @entity17 - based firms @entity41 and @entity42 , the mock - ups also include images of the station being converted into a theater and a restaurant			2
in total , there are 16 disused metro stations beneath the streets of @entity17 with most closed between the 1930s and 1970s			1
a small number were also built but have never been used			0

this could mean that taking a dip at the @entity30 metro swimming pool or snaffling a bite to eat in its subterranean restaurant may be a while in coming			0
that does n't make the pictures any less intriguing or pretty though .			0
