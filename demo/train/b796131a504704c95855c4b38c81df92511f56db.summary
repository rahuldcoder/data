-- @entity2 is testing a series of cosmetic changes to the top of users ' timelines , the company has confirmed			2
screenshots of the new design were posted on @entity10 tuesday morning			1
the images show a condensed version of @entity13 , in which a user 's details ( name , occupation , education , location ) appear in reverse type on top of â € ” rather than below â € ” the cover photo			1
the carousel of thumbnail images highlighting friends , photos , places , likes , etc. has also been compressed			0
images are now replaced by thumbnails			0
next to these , a new " summary " section appears , presumably to highlight key events on a user 's timeline			1
it 's not clear if the new design will give users greater control over the appearance of their timelines			2
we 're curious to know , for instance , whether users will be able to modify the color of the type that appears on top of their cover photos			0
what do you think of the new design ? do you like the reverse type ? would you miss the thumbnail images if they were removed ? © 2011 @entity0			0
