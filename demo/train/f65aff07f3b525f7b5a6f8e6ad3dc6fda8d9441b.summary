-- @entity1 opened to the public tuesday			0
up to now , you had to have an invitation from a current user before you could sign on to use the innovative phone add - on service			1
now , anyone in the @entity8 can sign up			2
@entity9 , which premiered in invite - only fashion a year ago , provides you with a single phone number that directs calls to your mobile , home or work phone , depending on the rules you set			1
beyond that , it includes a basketful of features including transcribed voicemail sent as e-mail or text message , free conference calling , free outbound domestic calls and call - screening			1
the service is free , except for international calls , which cost a fraction of what the phone company charges per minute			1
@entity1 used to be known as @entity1 before @entity31 bought the company in july 2007			0
@entity33 , the former ceo of @entity1 , now runs @entity1 , which he says has a million active users			0
" that 's a big number for a service that is invite - only , " @entity33 said			0
new users get a free new number , hopefully somewhere near their local area , and in anticipation of a rush , @entity9 has bought a bunch of numbers spread across the country ( though @entity45 and @entity46 remain " challenges " )			1
" we are pretty optimistic there will be a high demand , " @entity33 said			0
@entity9 also has native apps for @entity53 and @entity54 phones , while @entity56 and @entity57 users can use the @entity59 app ( including to make outbound calls )			1
@entity31 made a full - featured app for the @entity57 , which @entity62 controversially rejected on the grounds it would confuse users			0
the real cost of @entity57 vs. @entity53 rivals those who commit to giving out a @entity1 number as their central point of contact are n't locked into @entity31 and can port their number out to a phone company or to competing services such as @entity76			2
users ca n't yet port their existing numbers into @entity1 , which would eliminate the need to have to " commit " to your @entity9 number by giving it out to friends and contacts , and getting new business cards made			1
those unfamiliar with the service can see the features in this @entity31 - produced video			0
@entity9 could mature into a service that competes with @entity90 , which has become the world 's largest telephone service by allowing free calls between @entity90 users and cheap calls from pcs and mobile devices to overseas phone numbers			1
to that end , @entity31 purchased a @entity90 competitor called @entity101 last november , which lets users make calls from their pcs to other pcs or to the traditional network			0
five ways to slash your cell phone bill @entity31 is currently integrating this into @entity1 , though there is reportedly some internal friction over whether to scrap the downloadable software in favor of an @entity59 web app , even though the latter would n't have as good voice quality			2
currently , @entity1 calls use the minutes of a mobile phone plan , unlike @entity90 , which bypasses the voice channel by making calls using data plans			2
