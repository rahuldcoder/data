-- he is in that landing pattern that middle - aged heartthrobs finally come to : time for home and family and a woman who is worthy of keeping his love			1
the 50 - plus @entity11 winner , producer and political activist @entity9 is apparently engaged to be married			1
he 's at a particularly pivotal age			1
forget about the 50s being the new 40s -- the 50s are really very specific			0
even the most youthful people will start thinking about the meaning of life as the years no longer stretch out in a fantasy of infinity			2
those years between 50 and 60 do seem to be a particularly poignant age for men , especially the kind of man who has trouble giving up motorcycles			2
sometime in this period , the thrill seekers and lust lovers get their whiff of mortality ( perhaps because of their latest motorcycle accident ) and they turn to love with a new sense of its gravitas			1
with a nod to the motivation most of us mortals have , they are ready for an emotional legacy			0
( @entity45 : watch for children ) it might irk @entity9 to be seen as so predictable			2
he 's a gifted , idiosyncratic , goes - his - own - way , irreverent kind of guy			2
but he has been practicing for this life transition in full view			0
in his films , he has played lost middle - aged men , lost in their careers , lost in neglected marriages , lost because of a lack of connection to something important -- " @entity59 , " " @entity60 , " " @entity61 , " among others			1
many of these men reshuffle their lives , readjust their principles or at least find some self knowledge they sorely lacked			0
what we know about @entity70 if the reports of his engagement are true , this is kind of what @entity9 has done , and what a lot of professionally single men ultimately come to do , especially about love			1
his apparent fiancee , @entity70 , is an accomplished and wordly lawyer			0
@entity9 's doing that middle - aged love choice			1
he 's picking a woman of substance as well as beauty -- the kind of woman you would want as friend and counselor , the kind of woman who would have the genes to be the mother of your children -- and it 's now , because it suddenly dawns on you that you have no time to lose			2
in this scenario of the chastened older lothario , the candidate is young enough to lust after and smart enough for impregnation			0
it 's not that women , especially stars , do n't come to the same point as @entity9 and end up in the same position			2
but biology forces them to make the comparable choice at least a decade or so earlier			0
unlike a woman his age , @entity9 can do the whole settling - down gambit at almost any age			1
but he probably understood some ages are better for this than others			0
i know this is n't very romantic , but the timing is -- whether the 50 - something group knows it or not -- guided by the @entity119			0
if that sounds bad , it 's not			0
middle age is an important time for reassessment and course correction			1
no matter how bright your star , you know that only so much time is left to have a profound relationship and , perhaps , a family			0
this is the real anchor of middle - aged love : it 's time to stop fooling around .			1

@entity136 : @entity9 is *allegedly* engaged in his 50s , a pivotal age
@entity136 : " lust lovers " get a sense of mortality in their 50s and start taking love seriously
@entity9 has played lost , *unconnected* middle - aged men in his films , she says
@entity136 : middle age is at time for reassessment and correcting your life 's course
