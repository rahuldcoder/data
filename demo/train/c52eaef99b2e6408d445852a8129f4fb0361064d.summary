jurors will get to see @entity4 's trophy case when they visit his home during the former @entity8 star 's murder trial , a judge ruled recently			1
the visit may happen friday			2
the assistant district attorney asked the court for permission to hide the trophy case , indicating the defense was trying to engage in " strategic manipulation " or impress the jury with trophies or medals			1
the defense 's position was simple : that 's the way the house looked when the alleged victim was killed ... and that 's how it should be shown			2
trophy cases aside , the rest of us defense attorneys and prosecutors must be wondering about a threshold issue : what 's with the jury excursions in these kinds of cases ? this does n't happen in most trials			1
why the special treatment ? the decision whether to grant a " jury view " rests , as with many things , in the sound discretion of a trial judge			0
courts , meaning judges , have the inherent power to allow a jury in either a civil or a criminal case to view places or objects outside the courtroom			1
whether to permit a jury to conduct a view in a particular situation is a question committed to the trial court 's informed discretion			0
practically , what that likely means is , the judge just conducts a balancing test by weighing " what 's the point ? " against " do i really feel like going out in the cold for a jury view ? " this calculus usually yields the following result in a run - of - the - mill case : motion denied			1
there is a growing bifurcation of the criminal trial system and it has nothing to do with race			0
it has nothing to do either with the wealth of the defendant			0
simply put , there is a growing chasm between the way regular trials are conducted and the way high - profile trials are conducted			1
most murder trials do not conduct jury views of the murder scene			1
on one hand , parties should be able to request jury views where it would be important for a jury to view a scene in person , and photographs or video are inadequate substitutes			0
of course , on the other hand , establishing a defendant 's absolute right to a jury viewing would not work either , because parties would inevitably abuse the system ; the courthouse would look like a yellow bus depot dispatching a fleet of juries on field trips : depressing , macabre field trips			1
as gruesome as the facts are , the @entity4 case is not all that different from thousands of other murder prosecutions , except that it is a trial being covered by the media			1
scrutiny means the judge and the lawyers on either side will err on the side of caution			0
erring on the side of caution means motions and requests will be considered that would not ordinarily be considered			0
it 's a common misconception that only rich or famous defendants get this special consideration by the courts , but that 's not the case at all			1
@entity133 was an indigent , noncelebrity defendant , and @entity135 squandered half its gdp considering every request from both sides in that case			2
race really is n't a factor either			0
@entity144 's trial judge entertained many creative motions from both sides , and , contrary to initial reports , he is @entity148			0
high profile cases are terrific for both legal professionals and the general public , because parties are allowed to develop arguments they otherwise might not be allowed to make in an ordinary case			2
but it also gives the public a false impression : they do n't get a sense of the conveyor belt fashion in which the vast majority of criminal trials are conducted			2
there are two tiers of justice emerging in the @entity166			2
you do n't need to be a celebrity defendant to have access to the subtle accommodations of a high - profile case			1
you can be an unknown person , as long as you meet certain criteria			0
you have to be attractive ( @entity133 or @entity173 )			0
you have to inspire a controversial racial dialogue ( @entity144 or officer @entity175 )			0
or , as @entity4 or @entity176 can tell us â€” having a career in the @entity179 does n't hurt either .			1

@entity181 : celebrity trials are vastly different from the justice most *people* see
in a case like that of @entity4 , judges may be more willing to take a field trip
