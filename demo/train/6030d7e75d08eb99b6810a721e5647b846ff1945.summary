@entity0 -- the politics of fear			1
until recently , that seemed so 10 years ago , right after september 11 , 2001			0
that is , until @entity6 started beheading @entity7			0
now , just six weeks before @entity9 , security concerns could be a september surprise that shakes up the midterms			0
across the country @entity13 candidates on the ballot in november are using the threat posed by @entity6 to dust off an old playbook -- attack @entity19 opponents as weak on national security			1
the sun had barely come up tuesday after a night of new @entity7 and coalition airstrikes in @entity23 , when @entity26 @entity13 @entity25 challenger @entity24 released an ad using an ominous image of a fighter holding a black @entity6 flag , while @entity24 talks about the threat from " radical @entity33 terrorists			1
" @entity24 , a retired member of the @entity34 , touts his own experience in the ad before putting up side - by - side pictures of his @entity19 opponent , @entity39 , and president @entity40 , saying , " president @entity40 and @entity41 seem confused about the threat , not me			2
" this ad could hit particularly close to home in @entity26 ; @entity46 , the @entity7 journalist beheaded by @entity6 , was from the @entity26			0
related : @entity46 's mother " appalled " by @entity7 government but @entity13 strategists tell @entity1 that ads like this are driven by voter data from focus groups and polling all over the country , which signals that security is a rising priority among voters , especially with married women who @entity13 rely on in midterm elections			1
@entity61 , a @entity13 pollster who does work in several competitive races this year , tells @entity1 security is now a " top - tier issue that no one saw coming			1
" @entity1 poll : spike in terror fears in addition to his work for campaigns , @entity61 has polled for years on what he calls " @entity73 " -- female voters with children 18 or younger at home and shop at @entity78 at least once a month			1
during focus - group interviews @entity61 and colleagues conducted earlier this month in @entity81 and @entity82 , two key battleground states this november , " @entity73 express specific concern about @entity6 , " @entity61 said in a memo about the data			0
" this is an unusual for swing voters and not a common theme we have heard in previous groups , " the memo said			0
rep. @entity91 , the @entity92 @entity13 in charge of getting more @entity94 elected in november , also told reporters last week that national security issues were " popping " in opinion polls			1
the @entity98 is jumping on that -- rolling out four security - related television commercials last friday in competitive races , including spots that warned @entity19 ' positions make them " dangerous " in the face of new threats from @entity6			0
@entity91 cited " security moms " as a key group he believes are already gravitating towards @entity13 candidates			1
the issue , however , could ensure they go from supporting republicans to actually making sure to vote			0
two new ads were released on tuesday -- more proof that @entity13 are all in on this new security strategy			1
@entity115 ? both @entity13 and @entity19 campaign strategists say this mirrors the approach the @entity13 used effectively in 2002 and 2004			1
to former @entity121 sen. @entity120 -- it is eerily familiar			1
" that 's exactly what they did to me , " @entity120 told @entity1 in a telephone interview			1
in 2002 , the year after 9/11 , his @entity13 opponent @entity126 ran ads calling him weak on national security			1
despite the fact that @entity120 was a @entity131 veteran who lost three of his four limbs on the battlefield , @entity126 ' attacks resonated with @entity121 voters and @entity120 lost his @entity25 seat			1
@entity120 says there were a lot of other reasons for his defeat , but that certainly was a factor			2
so what is his advice to democrats like @entity39 who are coming under fire on the @entity26 campaign trail now ? " fight like hell and tell the people of @entity26 this is b * llsh * t , " said @entity120			2
" the @entity94 will use any advantage			0
if the economy was sucking air they would do that now , " @entity120 added			2
@entity39 did in fact release a statement tuesday pushing back on @entity24 's ad questioning her national security chops , saying " i have supported and will continue to support aggressive action to destroy @entity6 in @entity160 and @entity23			2
" she 's not the only @entity25 @entity161 under attack on security			2
republicans in @entity165 are hitting @entity19 sen. @entity166 for failing to focus on the terror threat			1
@entity166 is locked in a tight race with @entity13 candidate @entity169			2
the @entity170 and @entity169 tweeted out a chart on monday that showed that @entity166 had missed half of the hearings on the @entity174 , and as chair of a subcommittee on emerging threats , had not held a hearing on the terror group @entity6 at all			2
a spokesman for @entity166 acknowledges she did miss @entity174 hearings because they conflicted with other @entity25 work			0
but @entity19 deny that @entity183 ignored @entity6 in the subcommittee she chairs , saying she held several hearings on counterterrorism , and that @entity160 and @entity186 have been a major focus of all of them			0
@entity6 is such a big threat , the armed services chairman wanted to chair hearings on the issue before the entire committee			0
@entity166 aides are fighting back by slamming @entity169 for not taking a position on whether to arm and train @entity23 rebels , which @entity166 voted for			0
@entity40 offers ' broad vision of @entity7 leadership ' in @entity201 speech democrats push back there is some evidence @entity19 are worried that what they call " the politics of fear " could work against them			2
former @entity82 state rep. @entity208 , who was targeted by the @entity98 on friday , scrambled an ad of her own on the air to respond			0
the @entity13 used footage of @entity208 's response to a question in a recent debate , and suggested she would not support taking away @entity7 passports from suspected terrorists			1
@entity208 responded in her new ad by speaking directly to camera and calling her @entity13 opponent @entity221 's charge " a lie			1
" " i support revoking passports for terrorists , " said @entity208 in the ad			0
still @entity19 pollster @entity226 argues the concept of a " security mom " -- the kind of voter being targeted in these new ads -- does n't exist			0
she says it 's a myth			0
" we should not conflate an expression of concern about terrorism with it as a driver of vote choice , " says @entity226 in a blog for the @entity234			0
" voters typically look to the president and to the military for security , not to members of @entity247 , " says @entity226			0
" moreover , there is a world of difference between where we are now and where we were just after the 9/11 attacks			0
" on that , @entity13 pollster @entity61 agrees , calling today 's security concerns much lower than they were in the two elections after 9/11			1
still , he insists it has resonance -- especially given how close the @entity6 beheadings happened to @entity9			0
the chairman of the @entity262 , rep @entity261 of @entity264 , says he still believes that middle class economics , not national security , is the dominant factor in how most people will vote			0
share your view on the airstrikes @entity272 also argues that this @entity13 strategy will turn off independent and swing voters in key races			2
" they [ independent voters ] want to be united during a time of threat and do n't want a political party to divide @entity7 , " @entity272 told @entity1			1
" @entity283 as a political tool is meant as a strategy to turn out their base , but the inherent problem in pushing partisanship is losing persuadable voters , " he said , predicting it would " backfire " but @entity91 , @entity272 's @entity13 counterpart , says talking security on the campaign trail is a legitimate issue and fair game			1
@entity91 told reporters that its ' important for @entity13 candidates to engage voters on issues they are talking about , and recent developments in the @entity299 have made national security one everyone is talking about			2
@entity1 's @entity302 contributed to this report .			1
