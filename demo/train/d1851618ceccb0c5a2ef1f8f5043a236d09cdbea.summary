eager @entity4 fans who simply must get an iphone on day - one might have better luck with one of the stores offering in - store pre-orders			1
@entity55 is n't taking orders for the iphone 5 online before its sept 21 launch , but customers can go into a @entity55 location to pre-pay for the device and return to pick it up on launch day			1
the advanced difficulty level -- standing up , getting dressed , leaving the house , commuting to a @entity55 -- might mean less competition for pre-order units			0
