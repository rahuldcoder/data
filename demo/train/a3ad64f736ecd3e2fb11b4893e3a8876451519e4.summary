-- if you 're @entity2 or @entity3 , you 'll get one more hour to scour for votes ahead of tuesday 's presidential election			2
if you 're spending a night out on the town , that could translate to 60 more minutes dazzling the dance floor			0
and if you 're tired , or perhaps lucky , that means one more hour of sleep			0
@entity12 may bring health problems all options are on the table this weekend , when @entity17 residents turn back the clock as part of the semi-annual daylight saving routine			1
at 2 a.m. sunday , people will " fall back " one hour -- in essence , allowing them to relive the 1 a.m. hour two times over			1
the change affects all those in the @entity17 except for people in @entity27 and parts of @entity29 who do not observe daylight saving time			1
the territories of @entity33 , @entity34 , @entity35 and @entity36 also do not recognize the change			0
for those who do change the digits on their clocks , the sun will seem to come up earlier in the morning and it will set earlier at night , relative to conditions just a few days earlier			0
the idea for daylight saving came from legendary @entity36 inventor , statesman and founding father @entity47 who , in a 1784 letter to a @entity50 journal , suggested that @entity51 could save thousands of francs annually by waking up earlier in the summer so they would n't have to buy so many candles to light the evening hours			1
time : 8 ways to beat the winter blues the @entity17 did n't adopt the practice until the 20th century -- for a brief time during @entity59 , again during @entity60 and on a state - by - state basis in the years after the war			2
it became a national policy , with some tinkering , beginning in 1966			0
dozens of other countries now observe some form of daylight saving as well			1
the extra hour that people will get this weekend will only last so long			0
@entity17 will have to give it back by " springing forward " -- and turning ahead their clock -- one hour on march 10 , 2013 .			2

at 2 a.m. sunday , most @entity17 should turn back their clocks one hour
devised by @entity47 , daylight saving took hold in the @entity17 last century
