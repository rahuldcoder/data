-- his reputation might be that of @entity5 's ruthless wheeler dealer , but come the season of goodwill @entity8 likes to show a different side to his character			1
the 84 - year - old billionaire 's annual @entity12 card has often been a way for @entity8 to get things off his chest and his 2014 offering was no exception as he took aim at a legal case that has cost him $ 100 million			1
the card depicts him handing over that sum of money to a highway robber , who is pointing a pistol at him			0
" this is not a robbery , i am collecting for the @entity33 state , " says the man on horseback while a cartoon figure of @entity8 is seen clutching the sack of money			2
the greeting on the inside of the card contains says : " maybe now we can have a @entity5 race in the really nice city of @entity40 ( state capital of @entity33 ) , @entity42			1

money has often been a theme of previous @entity8 's @entity12 cards			2
reigning world champion @entity61 was the butt of the @entity5 chief 's humor in 2012 after the driver 's surprise switch from @entity67 to @entity68			2
