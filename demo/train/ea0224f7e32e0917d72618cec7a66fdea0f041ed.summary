-- " like the smell of a brand - new car " were the words of @entity3 astronaut @entity2 on saturday after he carefully opened the hatch and entered the @entity5 for his first glimpse inside			1
@entity5 connected with the station friday , making history as the first private capsule to reach the orbiting spacecraft			1
@entity2 opened the hatch at 5:53 a.m. et with @entity15 cosmonaut and station commander @entity16 by his side			1
the two men , wearing t - shirts , khaki shorts , goggles and masks gave the thumbs up to the camera after they floated inside			0
the initial inspection went smoothly and ahead of schedule and the interior looked good , according to @entity28 , the private company that built and operates the @entity5			1
@entity2 later told reporters in a briefing from space that the interior is roomier than the @entity15 soyuz capsule that carried him to the space station			1
he said " it looks like it carries about as much cargo as i could put in my pickup truck			0
" ashes of ' @entity41 ' actor on private rocket @entity5 delivered more than 1,000 pounds of cargo , including food , clothing , computer equipment and supplies for science experiments			1
after the crew unloads that cargo , they will reload the capsule with experiments and cargo for its return trip to @entity53			0
@entity5 is scheduled to splash into the @entity54 several hundred miles west of @entity55 on may 31 , according to @entity56			2
@entity2 said the crew has packed most of what its plan to send back to @entity53 , which includes everything from trash to scientific research and experimental samples			2
@entity5 triumph : only the beginning @entity5 launched tuesday from @entity66 , @entity67 , aboard @entity28 's @entity69 rocket			2
@entity56 collaborated with @entity28 on every part of the mission and gave final authorization for the flight			0
@entity5 reached the station friday and was " captured " by the station 's robotic arm just before 10 a.m. et. over the next two hours , the crew maneuvered the arm to bring the capsule in to berth and attach it to the station			2
the mission , hailed by @entity56 administrator @entity83 as a step toward a new future of private innovation in the space industry , comes as government funding of the space program decreases			0
it also marked the culmination of six years of preparation to bring commercial flights to the space station after the retirement of @entity56 's space shuttle fleet last year , which leaves the @entity97 with no means of independently sending humans into space			0
@entity56 relies on the @entity101 to ferry @entity97 astronauts to orbit			0
without the shuttle , the @entity97 also has limited capabilities to send supplies to the station and bring them back			0
@entity5 fills a need in taking significant payload back and forth , @entity2 said			1
in december 2008 , @entity56 announced it had chosen @entity28 's @entity69 launch vehicle and dragon spacecraft to resupply the @entity3 after the shuttle 's retirement			1
the $ 1.6 billion contract involves a minimum of 12 flights , with an option to order more missions for additional cost , according to @entity28			0
@entity28 was created by @entity121 founder @entity120 and is one of a few of private companies receiving @entity56 funds to develop the commercial transport of astronauts into space			2
@entity120 has said the commercial program -- with fixed - price , pay - for - performance contracts -- makes fiscal sense for taxpayers and fosters competition among companies on reliability , capability and cost			0
astronaut @entity138 , also aboard the space station , called the mission a great first step in the commercialization of spaceflight , and @entity2 agreed			1
" commercial spaceflight will blossom due to its own merits , and does n't really hinge on one mission , " @entity2 said			1
" it will hinge on the viability of launching many missions over a long period of time and being able to provide useful commercial goods and services in the low - earth orbit arena			0
" @entity28 is now developing a heavy - lift rocket with twice the cargo capability of the space shuttle and hopes to build a spacecraft that could carry a crew to @entity159 .			2

new : astronaut says the interior is roomier than the @entity163
new : @entity2 says commercial spaceflight will blossom on its own merits
@entity5 is the first private spacecraft to connect to the @entity3
it is carrying cargo including food and computer equipment
