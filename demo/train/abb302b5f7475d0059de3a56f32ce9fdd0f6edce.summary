-- a gunman opened fire friday in a @entity5 elementary school , killing 26 people , 20 of them children , police said			1
it was one of the deadliest school shootings in @entity10 history			2
readers posted more than 2,000 comments in response to questions we asked them in a story examining immediate shock and anger surrounding the incident			1
they looked at what problems might be involved and how society might go about solving them			2
here are 10 of the most popular suggestions			2
strengthen gun laws a lot of the posts were related to guns			1
" when are you going to wake up and realize that you need to restrict the use of guns in your country ? " asked @entity30			1
commenter @entity35 suggested changing the idea of a " right to bear arms " to a " privilege to bear arms			2
" she said she believes responsible gun owners will appreciate ground rules			2
" privileges have to be earned , they are n't a given , " she said			2
" prove that you are mentally stable and have a reasonable need to own a gun			2
make gun owners undergo mandatory training ; locking up your gun , loading and unloading safely , storing bullets separately , practices that make gun ownership safer			2
give police powers of inspection - checking gun safes , safe storage , training			2
no one can buy a gun without a training certificate in addition to background checks			2
no internet sales of guns or ammunition and no walking out with the gun the same day			1
" @entity65 suggested cracking down on gun crimes			2
" if you have been already convicted of a gun crime , the second time around , throw the book at them			2
repeat offenders need to be locked up a very very long time			2
keep gun regulations the same or relax them some said expecting people to give up gun use is unrealistic			0
" there will never be a way to get rid of guns in this country , " @entity77 said			1
" honestly i think it would come down to a civil war if that really was pushed hard			0
all we can do is find a way to help stop and prevent the violence from happening			1
look for the signs that cause people like this to do this and work for ways on prevention			1
" another reader said it 's difficult to regulate guns			1
" there are countless gun laws on the books already and any additional ones will only serve to keep honest people honest , " said @entity98			0
" criminals are criminals because they have no regard for the law and could care less whether guns are banned or not			1
your logic is rather simplistic or just plain ignorant and it 's sad that others seem to agree with you			0
arm the schools a user called @entity114 said it might be a good idea to have armed people in schools just in case			0
" these shootings are happening in @entity121 , " the commenter said			0
" the shooters know that the people there will have no way of defending themselves and that is why these tragedies are happening in these zones			0
we need to give the teacher 's defense so it will discourage these psychopaths from shooting there			1
there is great evidence that greater gun control means more gun violence ( because the bad guys still get guns and they know the good guys are unarmed )			1
" look , " he wrote , " are you seriously saying teachers should start having guns in elementary schools ? then what if a teacher has a bad day ? come on , this is irresponsible reasoning ! if this man was n't able to get his hands on a gun , he either would have used a knife and probably not killed a single person , or he would have given up on the entire plan and just committed suicide			1
improve school security to better prevent future crimes , some readers like @entity160 advocated defensive measures			1
" though i am for stricter gun control for automatic weapons , i think we should have stricter security in schools , no matter how nice and safe an area seems to be , " @entity160 said			1
" let 's get some metal detectors or something , and require every person to go through the security checks , even if the staff knows them			1
especially since , as this case proves , many people who commit these crimes are not just random strangers			0
" this person compared schools to airports			0
" i think schools should have security entrances with armed guards and metal detectors similar to courthouses and airports , " said @entity182			1
" it is no longer acceptable for it to be harder to get on a plane than it is to walk into a school			0
cut down on violence in the media some readers were concerned that fictional violence might be having real - world effects			1
" if they want to ban guns , why not ban them in movies , television , and video games ? " asked reader @entity198			1
" why do we allow the media and entertainment industries to glorify weapons and killings ? if we 're going to start regulating and banning weapons , why not start by aggressively banning and preventing the abuse of weapons in media			1
" " why do we allow our children and young adults to buy video games that put them in the position of being rewarded for shooting and killing other players ? i think it 's time @entity219 enact their own self - imposed ban on using weapons in any films or television productions			1
this would definitely reduce all kinds of violence			1
so why have n't they taken this bold and progressive step yet ? " 6			0
improve mental health care a commenter named brocore was one of many readers who said the issue stretched far beyond weapons and into the people who commit crimes			1
" pushing the blame onto guns diverts it from where the real need is : better , more comprehensive mental health services and facilities ; addressing these issues in their infancy when they 're first manifesting in childhood or puberty instead of assuming ' it 's just a phase ' or ' they 'll grow out of it ; ' not kowtowing to drug manufacturers by prescribing anti-depressants or whatever at the first sign of trouble ; getting people to understand that they wo n't be punished or cast out or labeled weird for seeking help			1
think about the families , not the shooter " quit sensationalizing the tragedy , " wrote a reader named @entity258 in what ended up being the most - liked comment			0
it was a list of five suggestions mainly asking for the perpetrator to be be ignored in favor of a focus on the family			0
" never mention the perpetrator 's name ; let them die in an anonymity , " the commenter wrote , adding , " @entity269 only on helping the families of the tragedy			0
" the post also expressed skepticism about attempts to control weapons : " bad people will do bad things			0
the only real control one can hope for is taking away whatever motivation or reward the person has for doing them , and even then , they may try			0
focus on parenting a commenter named @entity290 responded to @entity258 's comment and said that young people are being affected by our culture and need better preparation for the challenges of life			1
" we have raised an entire generation on the theory that we must protect their self - esteem at all costs , " @entity290 said			0
" then , while mom and dad had better things to do , we sat them in front of @entity307 and completely desensitized them to violence			1
so , if we stop shielding kids from every possible disappointment in life , so that when they face one , they are prepared for it ; if we take the @entity314 away once in awhile ; and if we actually talk to our kids occasionally , we might prevent some of this crap			1
" another reader said children need to be taught how to love other humans			0
" utopian futures , while nice to think about , are unattainable , " said user @entity321			0
" humans -- by their very nature -- are chaotic and violent			0
the best way to reduce violent outbreaks is by teaching our children kindness , empathy and love			0
take the time to be a parent			0
sure , more gun control will also help , but only marginally			0
the real problem is the parenting , rather lack thereof			1
bolster kids ' social skills @entity338 said it seems like the young people of " generation y " ( sometimes also called " milennials " ) are living their lives on screens			0
kids are playing video games and relying on social media instead of communicating face - to - face , @entity338 said , and pronouns are embedded in product names			2
the point : concentrating too much on technology and the self harms the ability to understand others ' emotions			0
" society and the media program gen @entity358 and the upcoming @entity361 generation that ' it 's all about you ' ( i.e. ipods , @entity364 , @entity365 , @entity366 , etc ) , meanwhile , our kids are not developing critical communication and coping skills , and are stunted socially , psychosocially and / or emotionally due to being ' detached ' and ' disconnected ' from each other by living life through the virtual world ( rather than the real world ) of screens			2
watch out for one another user brocore said society is most responsible of all , and especially having " empathy for every side			0
" " we can immediately label the shooter an insect or whatever pejorative you prefer , but that does n't help , " they said			0
" you ca n't fix the problem by casting these people out as an other			0
they 're us , and we 're them			0
what else can we do ? it 's your turn to speak			0
