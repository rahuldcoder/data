-- it 's a trip that would make @entity3 and @entity4 blush			2
on friday , the @entity5 , sponsored by the world 's largest nonprofit singles travel group , will make history by hosting the world 's first @entity10 , and we do n't mean the animal			1
defined by the @entity15 , a cougar is " an older woman who frequents clubs in order to score with a much younger man			1
" it can be anyone from " an overly surgically altered wind tunnel victim , to an absolute sad and bloated old horn - meister			2
" " a cougar is generally known as a woman over 40 who likes to date younger men , but theoretically any woman who dates younger men is a cougar , " said @entity24 , who came up with the cougar cruise idea			1
the ship , which sets sail from @entity34 , @entity35 , to @entity36 , @entity37 , for three nights , is booked for 300 guests and even has a waiting list			1
the ship has three swimming pools , a seven - deck - high atrium , bar and grill , a @entity47 - inspired @entity46 and a lounge that features stage shows , according to @entity50 , owner of the @entity51 and organizer of the @entity10			0
after making port in @entity36 , the cruise offers extracurricular activities like horseback riding , @entity57 and other outdoor excursions			1
" there 's at least four or five options a day for people to get together on the cruise			1
we 're doing lots of activities ; dancing , dining , @entity67 parties , karaoke for two hours			0
and starting at $ 125 a ticket , it 's a great price , " @entity69 said			0
" i 've had to hire two more people part - time just to pick up the phones , " she said			0
" i 've never seen a response quite like this			0
" @entity69 admits that she was hesitant to sign on to the idea but is glad she did			0
" we have people flying in from @entity82 and @entity83			0
my associates have been booking from @entity85 , @entity86			0
it 's fascinating , " @entity69 said			0
@entity24 , who has been hosting singles events for more than 30 years , said he got the idea after hosting a cougar convention in @entity91 , @entity35			2
" we had to turn away hundreds of people , " @entity24 said			0
" then we did one in @entity94 and had a massive crowd down there , so i thought , maybe we should do a cougar cruise			1
i did n't think anyone would want to go			0
needless to say , the phone is ringing off the hook			0
" these cougars may as well be an endangered species compared with those hunting them on this cruise			2
" the basic problem is , we have is too many cubs , " @entity24 said			0
" we usually have too many women and not enough guys , but there 's been a paradigm shift in recent years , so now the cubs are more excited about it than the cougars			2
" a " cub " is someone in their 20s or early 30s who likes to date older women , according to @entity24			1
for years , he says , it 's been socially acceptable for older men to date younger women			1
but in recent years , a phenomenon sparked by celebrities like @entity4 , baseball player @entity125 ( who is said to have dated pop star @entity126 ) and others has led a new generation of younger men on the prowl for more experienced partners			1
there is even an @entity134 sitcom called " @entity135 " that glamorizes the sexual escapades of a 40 - something divorcee on a search for self - discovery by dating younger men			1
" @entity143 [ and ] @entity142 was the first high - profile cougar - cub relationship , " @entity24 said of the actors , who have been together since the late 1980s			2
" now we 're seeing a paradigm shift where these younger guys are actively looking for older women			1
" " if you look at the demographics , the only logical way for people to get their needs met is for younger men to date older women , " he said			1
according to the @entity158 , for every 100 single women in their 20s in @entity157 , there are 118 single men in their 20s			1
the reason , @entity24 said , is that young women are dating older guys			2
" when you 're single , you always wish the person meets someone they want to be with			0
if this is something they want , then i wish them well , " @entity69 said .			0
