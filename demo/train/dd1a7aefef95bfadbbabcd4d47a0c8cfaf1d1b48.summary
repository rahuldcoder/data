editor 's note : @entity2 and @entity3 are co-founders of the @entity5 , the nonprofit organization that has spearheaded the development of @entity7			1
award - winning actor @entity8 , star of " csi : @entity12 , " is the national spokesman for the memorial			1
as we prepare to pay tribute this @entity22 to the courageous men and women who have selflessly served our country , the image of @entity15 soldiers who made the ultimate sacrifice in the wars in @entity18 and @entity19 is in our minds			1
but we also must recognize that many thousands have returned from these wars with severe injuries and permanent disabilities			2
the numbers of troops coming home with damaged bodies and , in many cases , minds , is increasing			2
advances in medical and military technology are reducing the number of deaths from combat , but soldiers who survive attacks often end up with lost limbs , horrific burns , traumatic brain injuries and other life - altering wounds			2
for example , in 2006 for every fatality in @entity19 , there were 16 wounded			2
we need to do a better job of honoring and meeting our obligations to these unsung @entity15 heroes			1
welcome home : share your homecoming experience beyond significantly increasing funding to meet the ever - growing costs of treatment , as well as other benefits , @entity15 has a responsibility to ensure that our disabled veterans are never neglected or erased from our collective memory			1
a permanent public tribute to recognize them is now underway			0
yesterday , in a ceremony attended by hundreds of disabled and able - bodied veterans whose service dates back to @entity71			1
house speaker @entity72 , secretary of veterans affairs @entity73 and others joined us to break ground on @entity7			1
sitting across from the @entity81 , in full view of the @entity80 , this memorial will serve to educate generations about the true cost of war , and to celebrate the men and women who may be broken in body but never in spirit			1
the groundbreaking , however , marks just the beginning of efforts -- our obligation -- to create this memorial			1
unfortunately , we often marginalize and forget the men and women who sacrificed for our freedom			0
in fact , veterans day itself has become for far too many of us an extra vacation day from work or school			0
for retailers , it has become yet another day to lure shoppers with special sales and promotions			0
all of us should instead consider this sobering fact : since 2001 , the number of disabled veterans has risen by 25 percent to over 3 million today			2
in contrast , the increase in the six years prior to september 11 , 2001 , was just 4 percent			0
well over 180,000 veterans of the @entity19 and @entity18 wars are already collecting disability benefits			0
a @entity115 study last year estimated that as many as 35 percent of @entity117 veterans will suffer from post-traumatic stress syndrome , a condition that has already led to high rates of depression , suicide , substance abuse , unemployment , relationship and family problems , and other issues			0
we have been privileged to meet a number of these veterans and have witnessed their herculean struggles to regain health , reshape lives shattered by disability , learn new trades or professions , and rejoin the civilian world			0
while their disabilities remind us of the fragility of life , they also inspire us with their fortitude , strength of character , and unflagging commitment , not just to survive , but to flourish as devoted husbands and wives , fathers and mothers , sons and daughters , friends and colleagues , and hard - working and productive citizens			0
we wish that every @entity15 could walk down the @entity154 in @entity155			1
it is a humbling and inspiring experience			0
the story of our country is told there in museums , monuments and memorials that commemorate the individuals and events that have shaped our history , molded our national character , and woven the very fabric of our nation			0
but , while there are many fitting memorials to fallen soldiers , as well as monuments to our founding fathers , there is nothing for disabled veterans			2
they are the only historically significant group that has not been recognized in such a manner			0
that is why the @entity180 is so important			0
much work still needs to be done , from fundraising and building an endowment to actual construction			1
we have faith that the @entity15 people -- individuals , foundations , and corporations -- will continue to lend their support			1
it is not possible to look into the eyes of any disabled veteran and not feel compelled to do something to recognize what he or she has given up for our sake , for the freedoms that we take them for granted			2
@entity200 said : " you will never know how much it has cost my generation to preserve your freedom			0
i hope you will make good use of it			0
" this @entity22 , let us think on the words of @entity15 's sixth president			1
let us pay special honor and be inspired by the over 3 million who continue to bear the scars of war long after the guns have fallen silent and the memory of their sacrifice has faded from the public 's consciousness			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity8 , @entity2 and @entity221 .			1

@entity8 , @entity2 and @entity221 say many return from war disabled
yesterday was groundbreaking for @entity7
the monument will be reminder of those who return from war , injured , changed
*writers* : fundraising , construction remain for monument ; @entity15 should support it
