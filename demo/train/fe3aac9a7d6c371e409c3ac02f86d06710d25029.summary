-- @entity1 has enjoyed complete dominance over @entity3 for the past four years but as the 2014 season approaches , is that about to change ? the all - conquering team and its four - time world championship - winning driver @entity6 have endured a less - than - satisfactory preseason testing period			1
the marque , which has also won the constructors ' championship four years in a row , completed fewer laps in preseason than any other team apart from @entity16 -- which missed three of the four tests			1
" right now , nothing is lost -- no race has been run , no point has been allocated -- but when i listen to some media we are right in the middle of a huge disaster , " @entity6 told @entity3 's official website after the final test event in @entity20 at the weekend as he outlined the case for the @entity1 defense			1
" there is massive hype and most people do n't know what they are talking about , " added @entity6			1
" yes , sometimes you make mistakes , but there is no team in the paddock who can say that they can run a day without any issues			1
despite @entity1 's struggles , @entity6 insisted it would be foolish to write off the team 's chances ahead of the season - opening @entity45 @entity44 on march 16			1
" true there are some that have had less than we have , but we will fight through it			0
everybody in the team -- including me -- is ready to fight , " added the @entity51			2
" we have been growing together to such an extent that we are strong enough to dive through tough times			0
" what has made this preseason so challenging is the raft of rule changes brought into the sport for 2014			2
@entity3 's hulking @entity64 engines have been consigned to the scrapheap and replaced by hybrid 1.6 - liter @entity67 models , while fuel and weight limits have also been imposed			0
interactive : @entity3 rips up the rulebook the move away from the loud @entity64 is a development that concerns @entity3 supremo @entity74 , who is worried the sport may lose some of its drama through the subsequent noise reduction			0
" i 'm not at all happy with the sound of the new engines , to be honest , " @entity74 recently told @entity0			0
" it does n't sound like @entity3 , but that 's my opinion , let 's wait and see what the public think			0
" if @entity1 is under pressure ahead of the @entity89 curtain - raiser , then @entity86 will be looking forward to it with relish			1
the @entity51 manufacturer , which finished second in the team standings in 2013 , had a fruitful time in @entity20 , with 2008 world champion @entity94 setting the pace on sunday			1
" we are driven to fight for the championship -- that all is super positive , " said @entity94 after an encouraging day at the @entity96			1
" but let 's keep the feet on the ground : right now -- even if all indications look great -- it is still difficult to know who is hot and who is not			0
" you go to @entity45 not knowing who the hell will be in the lead			2
reliability will be a huge factor -- for every single person in the team			0
" @entity116 is anticipating a start similar to the 2012 season -- when seven different drivers won the first seven races of the year -- with a number of teams jostling for early - season honors			1
" it could easily be like that , " said the 29 - year - old @entity124			0
" fortunately the @entity86 is such a good engine : you have @entity129 , who look like they could be a competitive team , and you have @entity131 who could be much further ahead			1
" maybe @entity133 will take the @entity129 to the front ! who knows ? " @entity136 @entity133 is a new arrival at @entity129 after eight years at @entity138 and he 's made a promising start to his career with the @entity142 team			2
the @entity136 set the fastest lap time of the weekend on saturday , while his rookie teammate @entity144 was also near the top of the timesheets in fourth position			2
" the team has done a great job and thank you also to @entity154 ( @entity129 ' engine supplier ) , " @entity148 's @entity144 told the team 's official website			0
" we still need to work very hard in these next two weeks but i overall i 'm happy with how testing has gone for us			0
" i am looking forward to picking up where we left off when we get to @entity89			0
