@entity0 -- facing low approval ratings and constant @entity5 criticism as his re-election campaign starts up , president @entity2 challenged @entity7 on thursday night to put the good of the nation over political benefit and pass a huge jobs plan he proposed			1
in a speech to a joint session of @entity7 , @entity2 told the legislators to " stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy " by quickly approving the $ 447 billion package of measures so he can sign it into law			1
" the people of this country work hard to meet their responsibilities			0
the question tonight is whether we 'll meet ours , " @entity2 said to applause			2
" the question is whether , in the face of an ongoing national crisis , we can stop the political circus and actually do something to help the economy			0
the question is whether we can restore some of the fairness and security that has defined this nation since our beginning			0
" @entity2 also told legislators that they should quickly pass his plan , called the @entity38			1
" there should be nothing controversial about this piece of legislation , " the president said			0
" everything in here is the kind of proposal that 's been supported by both democrats and @entity5 -- including many who sit here tonight			1
and everything in this bill will be paid for			2
" @entity2 said he will ask @entity7 to increase the $ 1.5 trillion target in deficit reduction being pursued by a special joint congressional committee to cover the cost of the @entity38			1
he said he will propose his own deficit - reduction plan on september 19 that would reform entitlement programs such as @entity59 while changing the tax system to end loopholes , lower the corporate tax rate and increase taxes for the wealthy			1
in essence , @entity2 resurrected his push for a so - called " grand bargain " -- a comprehensive deficit reduction package that includes all the drivers of government spending and deficits , including those traditionally favored and protected by both parties			1
@entity5 reaction ranged from an expressed interest in trying to work out compromise to outright rejection and criticism of what was labeled a repeat of failed policies from the past			1
house speaker @entity82 , who backed out of talks with @entity2 on a major deficit reduction - deal deal earlier this year , said the proposals the president outlined " merit consideration , " and added that he hoped for serious consideration by the @entity89 of @entity5 ideas			1
" it 's my hope that we can work together to end the uncertainty facing families and small businesses , and create a better environment for long - term economic growth and private - sector job creation , " said @entity82 , @entity92			1
conservative sen. @entity101 , @entity102 , was much more critical			2
" president @entity2 , perhaps not knowing what else to do , is simply calling for more of the same , as if giving us more of the failed policies of the last two - and - a - half years will somehow yield different results , " @entity101 said in a statement			1
" i believe president @entity2 's new ' stimulus ' will further delay economic recovery and continue to inflict harm on so many @entity112			1
" the @entity114 's top @entity113 , meanwhile , said @entity2 's proposal will present a " litmus test " for @entity5			1
" i hope they ( @entity5 ) will show the @entity112 people that they are more interested in creating jobs than defeating president @entity2 , " senate majority leader @entity117 of @entity118 said in a statement			1
" experts from the ratings agencies to @entity126 chairman @entity125 have said that political gridlock is the main obstacle standing in the way of our economic growth			0
it is time to put jobs and the economy ahead of partisan politics			0
" \ that point resonated with veteran @entity5 sen. @entity137 of @entity102 , who joked on @entity1 that the president 's poll numbers were very bad , but " have you seen @entity7 ' numbers ? " " we seek approval , too , " @entity137 said			1
according to @entity2 , the purpose of the proposed jobs legislation is " to put more people back to work and more money in the pockets of those who are working			2
" " it will create more jobs for construction workers , more jobs for teachers , more jobs for veterans , and more jobs for the long - term unemployed , " @entity2 said			1
" it will provide a tax break for companies who hire new workers , and it will cut payroll taxes in half for every working @entity112 and every small business			0
it will provide a jolt to an economy that has stalled , and give companies confidence that if they invest and hire , there will be customers for their products and services			0
you should pass this jobs plan right away			2
" he also told @entity5 he would take his case directly to the @entity112 people , and called on " every @entity112 who agrees to lift your voice and tell the people who are gathered here tonight that you want action now			2
" " tell @entity0 that doing nothing is not an option , " @entity2 said			2
@entity89 spokesman @entity187 told @entity1 that @entity2 will send @entity7 jobs plan legislation next week			1
@entity2 's plan comes as unemployment remains lodged at 9.1 % with no new jobs reported in august , raising fears of a possible return to recession			1
with 14 months to go until the presidential election , he wants the plan -- as well as the speech to @entity7 to present it -- to clearly illustrate to the @entity112 public the ideological differences between his policies and those of the @entity5 right			1
the mood in the @entity89 chamber was jovial before the speech , with vice president @entity206 playfully hugging speaker @entity82 when he arrived at the dais			1
@entity209 legislators repeatedly applauded during the address			0
@entity89 @entity5 and @entity89 sources told @entity1 that @entity2 called @entity82 and @entity212 on thursday afternoon to preview the speech			1
even so , a legislative struggle is certain			0
@entity5 call for corporate tax cuts and deregulation as steps to spur job growth , opposing what they label new stimulus spending			1
the @entity209 leader in the @entity5 - controlled @entity89 -- rep. @entity222 of @entity223 -- asked the ranking @entity209 on committees that will consider the legislation proposed by @entity2 to urge their @entity5 chairmen to " schedule immediate hearings and legislative action " on the measures			1
@entity82 , meanwhile , invited 12 business leaders -- dubbed " job creators " in his statement -- who have been affected by regulations enacted by the administration to attend the speech			2
these are " people with real world experience on how the regulations coming out of this administration are impeding their ability to grow their business and create jobs , " @entity82 's statement said			1
at least five republicans -- two senators and three @entity89 members -- did n't plan to attend the speech , which @entity114 minority leader @entity249 said was more of a political event than a policy statement			1
" by all accounts , the president 's so - called jobs plan is to try those very same policies again and then accuse anyone who does n't support them this time around of being political and overly partisan , of not doing what 's needed in this moment of crisis , " @entity212 , @entity252 , said thursday morning			1
" this is n't a jobs plan			0
it is a re-election plan			0
" anticipating such criticism , @entity2 said he was proposing needed and logical measures that traditionally receive broad support			2
" this is n't political grandstanding			0
this is n't class warfare			0
this is simple math , " he said			0
" these are real choices that we have to make			0
and i 'm pretty sure i know what most @entity112 would choose			0
it 's not even close			0
and it 's time for us to do what 's right for our future			0
" @entity2 said his plan would increase the current payroll tax cut to put additional money in the pockets of @entity112 at a cost of $ 175 billion			1
the current cut , which has cost $ 112 billion so far , allows employees to pay 4.2 % instead of 6.2 % on their first $ 106,800 of wages into @entity291			2
@entity2 's proposal included extended unemployment benefits , which were lengthened to the current 99 - week maximum in 2009			1
top @entity209 argue that such money will immediately be pumped back into the economy in the form of new consumer spending			0
in addition , the plan proposes $ 60 billion for infrastructure development such as repairing roads and bridges , including establishment of an infrastructure bank to help finance such projects			2
other provisions in the president 's proposal include money to refurbish schools and provide state aid for teachers and first responders , and tax incentives for small businesses to hire the long - term unemployed and military veterans			2
looking abroad , the president also renewed his push for congressional approval of stalled free trade deals with @entity323 , @entity324 and @entity325			0
the measures , despite the congressional roadblock , have relatively broad bipartisan support			0
the president took aim at tea party conservatives who call for deep spending cuts to shrink government instead of the comprehensive approach he advocates			0
" in fact , this larger notion that the only thing we can do to restore prosperity is just dismantle government , refund everyone 's money , let everyone write their own rules , and tell everyone they 're on their own -- that 's not who we are , " @entity2 said			2
he repeatedly urged the legislators to " pass this jobs bill , " using a rhetorical flourish that regularly prompted cheers and applause form @entity209			0
" no single individual built @entity112 on their own , " @entity2 said			2
" we built it together			0
we have been , and always will be , one nation , under @entity359 , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all ; a nation with responsibilities to ourselves and with responsibilities to one another			0
members of @entity7 , it is time for us to meet our responsibilities			0
" @entity1 's @entity370 , @entity371 , @entity372 , @entity373 , @entity374 and @entity375 contributed to this report .			0
