@entity0 -- a @entity4 turned himself in to @entity3 authorities thursday to say he was responsible for one of two incidents in which vehicles smashed into @entity3 a day earlier , the @entity3 military said			1
though the motives were n't immediately clear , the incidents were the latest in a series of vehicles striking pedestrians in @entity3 and the @entity15 as the long - taut tensions between @entity3 and @entity4 worsened in recent months , agitated in part by killings and a seven - week @entity3 - @entity20 conflict earlier this year			1
they also came amid days of outrage and clashes in @entity0 over the status of one of the holiest sites in @entity27 -- the @entity28 , known by @entity29 as @entity28 , or the @entity28			1
the man who surrendered thursday said he was the driver who rammed into an @entity3 military post wednesday near @entity32 in the @entity15 , injuring three @entity3 soldiers , the @entity3 military said			1
the driver fled after the incident			0
the injured soldiers were taken to @entity0 's @entity36			1
all three are in moderate condition , said dr. @entity39 , the hospital 's deputy head			0
earlier , @entity3 police spokeswoman @entity41 said one was in critical condition			2
earlier wednesday , a @entity4 man drove a van into pedestrians at a rail station in eastern @entity0 , killing an @entity3 border police officer and injuring 13 other people , police said			1
police shot and killed that driver , identified by @entity3 authorities as a member of the @entity58 @entity57 movement , @entity41 said			2
news of the driver 's killing ignited fierce clashes between @entity3 security forces and @entity4 youths at the entrance of an eastern @entity0 @entity4 refugee camp where the suspect lived , according to witnesses			1
no motive was immediately released , but @entity57 supported the hitting of the @entity0 pedestrians in a text message to the news media : " @entity57 blesses the action			2
what is happening in @entity0 is pushing us to prepare for war			2
" @entity3 police spokesman @entity78 called the incident " a terrorist attack			2
" wednesday 's developments came on the heels of two hit - and - run incidents that happened in @entity0 and the @entity15 last month			1
on october 22 , a @entity4 man rammed his car into commuters waiting at a light rail stop in @entity0 , killing a baby and wounding several other people , @entity3 police said			1
@entity4 state news reported that a 5 - year - old girl died on october 19 after an @entity3 settler deliberately ran over her as she returned home from kindergarten near a village to the north of @entity98 in the @entity15			1
clashes at @entity0 holy site wednesday 's pedestrian crashes also came against a backdrop of days of unrest over the @entity28 , or @entity28			1
@entity3 police on wednesday clashed with @entity4 youths at the holy site , leaving more than 15 people injured , according to paramedics with the @entity108			1
it was just the latest round of unrest there since activist rabbi @entity110 was shot and gravely wounded last week after championing more @entity112 rights at the site , where @entity112 can currently gather , but not pray			0
@entity3 police shot and killed a suspect in @entity110 's shooting			2
@entity117 's october 29 shooting helped to ratchet up tensions in @entity0 and prompted @entity3 authorities to close the holy site for one day -- a move that a spokesman for @entity124 president @entity123 called a " declaration of war			1
" recent tension at the holy site some of the recent tension centers on the @entity28 / @entity28 and @entity110 , who has argued that @entity112 must have a place of worship there			1
such a @entity112 prayer right is a sensitive issue for @entity29 , who suspect a plan to expel them from the site			0
a spokesman for the military wing of @entity57 said wednesday that the site 's @entity141 " is the detonator needed to ignite a volcano in the face of the cowardly and treacherous occupier			0
" " we salute the heroes of the mujahideen of @entity57 , " @entity143 said in a message posted on the military wing 's website			0
since @entity29 began construction at the site in the seventh century , @entity28 , now controlled by an @entity151 trust , has been an almost constant source of tension between @entity29 and @entity112			0
@entity156 controlled the site for a time until 1967 , when @entity3 seized eastern @entity0			1
with its golden dome overlooking @entity0 , the site is said to have hosted sacred events in the @entity112 , @entity151 and @entity161 religions			2
@entity112 tradition holds that the @entity28 contains @entity163 , where @entity164 , the @entity165 patriarch , is said to have nearly sacrificed his son -- under @entity168 's orders -- before an angel intervened			0
later , @entity3 @entity170 constructed the first @entity112 temple on the mount , including the @entity173 , a room that kept the @entity175			0
at the foot of the @entity28 , the 62 - foot - tall @entity177 , or @entity177 , stands			0
once supporting the courtyard of the ancient temple , @entity112 gather there now to hold religious services , to pray or to slip notes into its cracks			0
for @entity29 , the @entity28 contains one of the most sacred sites in @entity151 : the @entity141			0
@entity29 believe that the @entity187 was carried on a flying steed from @entity189 to the site during his miraculous @entity191 , said @entity192 , an expert on @entity151 and politics at the @entity194			0
