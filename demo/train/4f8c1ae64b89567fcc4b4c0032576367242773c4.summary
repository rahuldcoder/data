-- the alleged terror incident aboard a passenger flight from @entity3 to @entity4 has raised questions as to how a @entity7 man carried explosives through stringent security measures			1
@entity10 has been charged with attempting to destroy a passenger plane after he detonated a device on board a jet on friday			0
authorities in the @entity16 are investigating whether @entity10 had any connections with terrorist organizations or was acting alone			2
airports intensify security after plane attack with @entity24 officials scrutinizing security procedures at @entity3 's schiphol airport that allowed the 23 - year - old man to smuggle the explosives on the aircraft -- here are some of the key questions still hanging over the incident			1
where did the explosives come from ? the man charged with igniting the device claims he obtained the explosives in @entity39 , along with instruction on how to use it			0
he carried these onto a flight from @entity43 , @entity7 , to @entity3 , @entity24 where he transferred to @entity45 to @entity4			1
was he on any security watch lists ? @entity16 authorities say they were contacted by the man 's father ahead of the attack , but whether he was placed on any so - called @entity51 maintained by the @entity16 is unclear			2
@entity24 officials say the passenger 's name appeared on a manifest supplied by the airline , which was passed to @entity16 authorities , who cleared the flight to depart			1
were the proper security checks performed ? yes , say @entity24 authorities , who say he passed through normal procedures and that " security was well - performed			1
" he is known to have passed through a metal detector and his luggage was x-rayed			0
extra attention is normally applied to passengers arriving from @entity7 because of concerns over fraud and smuggling			0
nevertheless airports around the world have stepped up security procedures in the wake of the incident , increasing pat - downs and secondary searches			1
so how did the explosives get through ? @entity24 authorities are at pains to point out that if the passenger had powders concealed upon his person or secreted bottles of liquid somewhere else , they certainly would not have been picked up by the metal detector			1
is there any way of detecting these kind of explosives ? a preliminary @entity91 analysis indicates the device contained @entity93 , also known as @entity93 , a highly explosive chemical			0
experts say this would have been picked up using a swab commonly used in secondary screening			2
a body scan , particularly the new 3d imaging scanners being trailed at some airports , would also have spotted something strapped to his body , even in the crotch area			0
why were there no @entity16 air marshal security officers on the flight ? @entity16 homeland security secretary @entity109 told @entity0 federal air marshals are not posted on all flights			2
she said this was not due to budgetary constraints , but down to standard procedures , which see marshals posted randomly on certain routes			0
@entity0 's @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119 contributed to this report .			0

@entity24 authorities say normal security procedures were carried out
authorities say they would not have picked up secreted powders or liquid
secondary checks should pick up *similar* devices
