-- another place on @entity3 's motorized @entity2 has been filled for the 2014 season			0
pastor @entity5 has been named as @entity8 @entity7 's teammate at the @entity9 after leaving @entity10			1
@entity5 , whose deal with @entity10 had been funded by the @entity13 state oil company @entity12 , has filled the @entity9 seat vacated by 2007 world champion @entity15 , who is returning to @entity16			1
" it is a fantastic opportunity for me to join @entity9 for 2014 , " @entity5 said in a statement			1
" it 's no secret that i have wanted a change of scene to help push on with my @entity3 career and @entity9 offered the very best opportunity for me to be competitive next season			0
" the regulations and cars will change significantly so it is a very good time for a fresh start			0
" the @entity13 made his @entity3 debut in 2011 with @entity10 and the following season he clinched a shock win for the former world champion team at the @entity34 @entity33 -- the first by an @entity3 driver from his country			1
@entity5 's brief reign in @entity34 was the high point of his relationship with @entity10 , a partnership that showed signs of stress towards the end of the last campaign			1
at the penultimate @entity47 @entity33 , the 28 - year - old said : " leaving is an important moment for my career			2
" before signing for @entity9 , @entity5 was among of group of @entity3 protagonists without a drive at the end of the 2013 season , which reached its climax in @entity58 last weekend			2
@entity60 duo @entity59 and @entity61 , @entity63 's @entity62 , @entity65 pair @entity64 and @entity66 , @entity69 's @entity68 driver @entity67 and @entity71 pairing @entity70 and @entity72 are yet to settle their futures			2
many drivers are now expected to fund their own drives in @entity3 , a problem that has been exacerbated ahead of the new season			0
a major rule change looms large in 2014 and that means the 11 teams are having their resources stretched , with the new turbo engines alone estimated to be three times more expensive than the ones being phased out			0
@entity7 has managed to avoid the fray of the driver market by securing a third straight season with @entity9			1
after an erratic 2012 season , which included a one - race ban for dangerous driving , the 27 - year - old showed consistent improvement in 2013 , racing to six podiums			2
his performances were enough to see @entity9 take up the option to extend his contract			0
" i am very happy to have official confirmation that i will be continuing to drive for @entity9 next season , " said @entity7 , who , like @entity5 , became a father for the first time in 2013			1
" this past year has been tremendously satisfying for me			0
i know everyone is motivated to continue the fight for every last point available			0
" although @entity9 won the opening race of 2013 in @entity105 , the final part of the season was overshadowed by speculation over the team 's finances			2
lead driver @entity15 , who opted to have back surgery rather than race in the final two grands prix of the year , was reported to be owed $ 20 million in wages			1
the arrival of @entity5 is likely to help boost the team 's coffers as he is expected to once again bring financial support to his new team			1
@entity9 team principal @entity120 added : " it is clear that @entity122 has pace and potential			0
we are convinced that we will be able to provide the correct environment to enable him to flourish regularly on track			0
" with @entity7 and pastor i believe @entity9 will be able to cause quite a few surprises next year			1

pastor @entity5 and @entity7 will race for the @entity133 team in 2014
@entity5 joins from @entity10 to *replace* @entity15 , who is returning to @entity16
@entity8 driver @entity7 keeps his seat at @entity68 - based team for third straight year
@entity5 is expected to bring financial support from *native* @entity13
