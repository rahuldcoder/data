@entity0 -- @entity2 is not a large man			1
he does not move with the easy assurance of a skilled fighter			0
his head sits low on his neck , and he seems to turn from the shoulders			0
his swept - back , graying hair and rimless glasses make him look like a @entity12 accountant who sleeps with a tie on			0
yet , in @entity0 , @entity2 is a heavyweight of the first degree , a brawler who can make even brave politicians toss in the towel at the first sign of a scuffle			1
the longtime executive vice president and public face of the @entity23 faced some of his toughest critics on @entity26 wednesday -- including @entity28 sen. @entity27 , author of the updated bill hoping to again ban military - style assault rifles -- as he testified in front of the @entity33 at a hearing titled " what should @entity35 ? " he argued that government should focus on enforcing existing gun laws rather than drafting new ones			1
" law - abiding gun owners will not accept blame for the acts of violent or deranged criminals , nor do we believe that government should dictate what we can lawfully own and use to protect our families , " he told lawmakers			1
@entity23 official to @entity50 : more gun laws not the answer the tough champion of the @entity54 has been taking heat since the @entity23 came out strongly in favor of armed security in every public school in @entity59 , days after the deadly shooting in @entity61 , @entity62			1
but that 's what makes @entity2 so formidable : his unflinching willingness to say aloud what many foes consider outrageous			1
" why is the idea of a gun good when it is used to protect the president of our country or the police , but bad when it is used to protect our children in our schools ? " @entity23 draws heat over shooting game that was the head of the @entity23 speaking to a room packed with cameras and reporters a week after the @entity61 school shooting			1
he was pushing the idea of armed guards in every school			0
a headline in @entity91 proclaimed " @entity96 ! " while another called him the " @entity94 on @entity95			0
" but @entity2 did not even blink , going on " @entity97 " to say , " if it 's crazy to call for armed officers in our schools to protect our children , then call me crazy			1
" for many of his supporters , that had the ring of common sense , and that 's what makes @entity0 nervous			2
@entity2 has been the leader of the @entity23 for more than 20 years , turning it into a political juggernaut			1
the group boasts more than 4 million members capable of pouring money into political races at the drop of a hat			0
how the violent mentally ill can buy guns more importantly , @entity23 fans have proved that they can be relied on to show up at the polls and savage any candidate , @entity120 or @entity121 , who strays from the doctrine of the @entity54 , as they see it			2
and @entity2 is the man who commands that political wrath , frequently by unleashing a torrent of scathing accusations against those who would oppose him			2
a few examples : in a 1995 fundraising letter , he referred to federal agents enforcing gun laws as " jack booted thugs			2
" after 1999 's @entity134 , he complained that gun owners in general , and @entity23 members in particular , were being unfairly portrayed as " ... somehow a reckless , societal , pathogen ; a mighty , extremist empire opposed to safety , caution and reason			1
that is a cruel and dangerous lie			0
" in 2000 , he suggested that president @entity144 was allowing gun deaths to pile up to spur anti-gun sentiment among voters			2
when @entity149 congresswoman @entity148 was shot , @entity2 noted that the gunfire came close to a school , a designated " gun free " zone , and again he ripped into gun opponents			1
" that did n't make any difference			0
their laws did n't work			0
their lies do n't ring true			0
and if @entity161 tells us anything at all , it tells us this : government failed			0
" @entity23 clear on gun debate stance : arm schools make no mistake : there is no indication that @entity2 is a loose cannon or someone who does not mind his words			1
to the contrary , they are chosen with the precision of a marksman			0
even if his opponents hate to admit it , he follows an unswervingly clear course with his statements ; always attacking , never ceding even an inch , and relentlessly portraying those who would infringe on gun rights as radicals			0
year after year , for all the bluster around gun issues , the @entity23 has emerged victorious , galvanizing millions of @entity59 who feel that government too often overreaches and intrudes upon individual freedoms			1
simply put , it is the language of motivation			0
and when it comes to guns , no one speaks it like @entity2			2
@entity23 chief : @entity196 makes ' mockery ' of @entity59 freedoms			2

@entity23 executive vice president @entity2 has been a strong *advocate* for gun owners
he 's also known as a brash , heavyweight brawler who rarely backs down from a fight
