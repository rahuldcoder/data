@entity2 , a top intelligence official said more than a year ago , has " ruthlessly grown in effectiveness			2
" in october a senior administration official said the terror group represented " a major and increasing threat " -- to the region and the @entity7			2
eight months ago , the military 's top intelligence official warned @entity2 " will attempt to take territory			2
" @entity2 threat : @entity13 town fears massacre those were the public assessments of @entity2 coming from president @entity17 's own administration dating back more than a year			1
so why is the president saying now his intelligence agencies misjudged the terror group , currently being pummeled by @entity7 and coalition airstrikes ? in an interview with " @entity23 , " @entity17 admitted the @entity7 " underestimated what had been taking place in @entity13 " that allowed the country to become " ground zero for jihadists around the world			1
" he cited his director of national intelligence @entity30 , who told the @entity32 in mid-september the @entity7 " underestimated @entity33 [ the government 's name for @entity2 ] and overestimated the fighting capability of the @entity38 army			1
" @entity40 exclusive : @entity2 fighter says @entity7 airstrikes are n't effective those remarks echoed @entity17 's own statement from early august , when he told reporters " intelligence estimates " had n't accurately predicted @entity2 ' advances through @entity38 and @entity13			1
in remarks and testimony , however , @entity7 officials have been warning of @entity2 ' rise going back more than a year -- while at the same time warning of the limited intelligence - gathering capacity inside the countries where @entity2 was expanding			1
@entity17 subtly pushes back against @entity55 , @entity56 on @entity13 the warnings extend as far back as july 2013 , when @entity58 , then acting as deputy director of the @entity60 , told a conference that @entity63 - affiliated groups were gaining strength in @entity13			2
" it is very clear over the last two years they have grown in size , grown in capability and ruthlessly grown in effectiveness , " he said at a @entity40 - sponsored panel at the @entity66			0
" they will not go home when it is over			0
they will fight for that space			0
they are there for the long haul			0
" since then , officials have warned that @entity2 was n't going anywhere -- including in october , when a senior administration official told reporters on a conference call that the danger from @entity2 was intensifying			0
" this is really a major and increasing threat to @entity38 's stability ... and it 's an increasing threat to us , " said the official , who was previewing a visit to @entity88 by then - @entity38 prime minister @entity89			1
next step : keeping @entity96 coalition together the warning had ramped up by february , when the director of the @entity60 told lawmakers @entity2 was looking to gain ground			0
" [ @entity63 in @entity38 / @entity33 ] probably will attempt to take territory in @entity38 and @entity13 to exhibit its strength in 2014 , as demonstrated recently in @entity106 and @entity107 , and the group 's ability to concurrently maintain multiple safe havens in @entity13 , " @entity101 wrote in prepared testimony for the @entity103			1
the terror groups , @entity101 wrote , had " exploited the permissive security environment to increase its operations and presence in many locations and also has expanded into @entity13 and @entity115 to inflame tensions throughout the region			0
" @entity120 press secretary @entity119 said monday that @entity17 was n't blaming his intelligence services when he said they " underestimated " @entity2			1
" the way that i would describe it is that everybody did ; that everybody was surprised to see the rapid advance that @entity33 was able to make from @entity13 across the @entity38 border and to be able to take over such large swaths of territory in @entity38 did come as a surprise , " @entity119 said			0
he added it was also difficult to assess ahead of time how well @entity38 security forces would be able to defend their own country because of the sectarian divisions in @entity38 's government			1
he admitted there was some doubt that the forces would fend off @entity2 's incursions			0
" and i think that proved to be true in the end that @entity33 was able to make significant gains because of the @entity38 security forces were n't able to withstand their advance , " @entity119 said .			0

top officials have long been warning about the threat posed by @entity2
president @entity17 said the @entity7 " underestimated " the group 's rise in @entity13
it was also hard to predict @entity38 's defense capabilities , the @entity120 says
