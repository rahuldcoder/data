-- switching off your cellphone during a flight will soon be a thing of the past , according to aviation experts , who are tipping in - flight mobile connectivity to become a standard feature of air travel			1
@entity9 recently announced that passengers can make calls on their cellphones on the airline 's @entity13 and @entity15 flying between @entity16 and @entity17			1
call charges are similar to international roaming rates , and phones can not be used during take off and landing			1
but @entity9 is n't alone -- more than 100 other aircraft are currently equipped to allow calls to be made in the air			1
the ceo of @entity26 , which provides mobile connectivity to @entity28 , @entity9 and @entity30 planes , said 1,000 aircraft would be fitted with the company 's systems over the next three years			1
@entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 , @entity39 , @entity40 and @entity41 will all launch in - flight mobile offerings in coming months , he said			1
" we believe this is going to be standard in most airlines , " said @entity42 , @entity26 ceo			2
" you will have connectivity in the air in the same way you have connectivity on the ground			0

the @entity26 system , which has been available on @entity28 flights since 2008 , allows for six calls to be made by passengers at any one time ( soon to be upgraded to eight ) , and unlimited texts and data usage			2
for years , airlines have banned the use of cellphones citing their interference with onboard equipment			2
but @entity26 's technology involves installing a small mobile base station on board to manage signal strength , and ensure calls do not interfere with flight systems			1
@entity42 said research suggested about 20 cellphones were inadvertently left switched on during any given flight , and claimed that the company 's technology actually reduced the signal strength of those active cellphones			2
" if you switch on a cellphone on board , and there 's no network , it will gradually increase the power it 's transmitting because it 's trying to get hooked on a network which does n't exist , " he said			0
" with our system on board , those cellphones will emit much less power			0
" the service is proving popular with passengers , with one passenger on @entity9 's fledgling service reportedly having sent 80 text messages during a single flight			1
aviation analyst @entity102 of @entity103 tipped mobile connectivity to become standard across the industry , and the price of access to drop			2
" this is clearly what business travelers need			0
many leisure passengers may not want to pay for it though , " he said			0
" but the technology is there , and if the airlines can get the volume up , they can most likely get the price down			0

despite being a leader in in - flight @entity128 , the @entity126 bans the use of mobiles on flights , requiring that phones are switched off once they enter @entity126 airspace			1
@entity135 , editor of @entity136 , said the @entity137 ( @entity137 ) was currently looking into the technology , and predicted the restrictions would be lifted in a matter of years			0
" once this technology is deemed safe by the @entity137 , they 're going to have to join the rest of the world , " she said			0
" regulations are going to change whether people like it or not			0
" she said that despite the convenience of in - flight mobile connectivity , the impression she had gained from studies and social media reactions was that many @entity126 were opposed to calls being allowed on flights , because they were perceived as a nuisance			1
but in the years that in - flight calling had been allowed in other regions , she knew of no instances of air rage connected to phone use -- something she attributed to airlines establishing good protocols around call etiquette			1
" you ca n't legislate manners from a regulatory standpoint , " she said			0
" sooner or later , the arguments against mobile connectivity are going to fall away			2

@entity9 has introduced in - flight calls on *transatlantic* flights
new systems allow for mobile phones to be used on planes without affecting equipment
in - flight calling is still banned in the @entity126 , but some are tipping this to be overturned
call charges are similar to international roaming rates
