@entity0 , @entity1 -- you may have watched in wonder as @entity5 dismantled @entity1 on tuesday			2
but to really appreciate the art of @entity8 football you need to understand the lingo			1
the sport has its own vocabulary and , as is common in the @entity8 language , most new terms are created by simply lumping several words together to make a 15 or 20 character monster word that would be an entire sentence in many other languages			1
so here is our guide to help you become an expert while watching sunday 's final			1
first , start strong in defense			2
you need a great goalkeeper or a @entity24 ( @entity26 's man )			1
he needs to command the penalty area , be the first to corner kicks and block shots and penalty kicks			2
@entity8 history is rich with great goalies from @entity33 to @entity34 and @entity35 all the way to today 's man between the posts , @entity37			1
if your goalkeeper does not perform he is laughed off as a @entity41 ( fly catcher )			1
moving on to your defense , which is always the core of a @entity8 team			1
this is the @entity46 ( defensive barrier )			2
great defenders have to excel at the @entity49 ( blood tackle ) to take out attacking opponents			0
prototypical @entity8 defenders have names like @entity54 and @entity55 from the @entity57 squad , who struck fear into most opponents			1
there are also smaller more shifty defensive players who can not be shaken off by attackers that are called @entity66 ( calf - biters ) , like @entity67 from the 1974 squad or @entity69 from today 's team			2
@entity67 earned the nickname the @entity72 , like a little dog who never stops snarling around its enemy			0
think of the @entity8 midfield and you think of names like @entity79 , @entity80 , @entity81 or today 's squad which is laden with talent including @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , @entity87 , and @entity88			1
great midfielders who lead teams are known as @entity91 ( midfield directors )			0
these midfielders must also be able to deliver perfect @entity94 ( banana passes ) , usually with the outside of their foot , setting the forwards free on goal			2
and talking of the forwards , their main job is to score goals			0
you want a striker on your team who is a @entity105 ( goal hunter )			0
but in order to be a great @entity105 he has to have a great @entity108 ( goal nose ) , someone with the instinct to be in the right place at the right time			0
@entity5 is fortunate to have had two @entity105 with the same last name in @entity114 , who scored the decisive goal in the 1974 final against the @entity117 , and @entity118 of today 's squad who was the top scorer in the @entity120 and has five so far in @entity1			2
then there was the current @entity123 coach @entity122 who made his mark in the @entity57			1
if your forwards and strikers have many chances but never seem to put the ball in the net , they will be dismissed as @entity132 ( death of chances )			0
believe it or not , @entity5 has had its share of these			0
if you have your @entity137 and @entity108 in your team , good for you			0
if not your team may be ridiculed as a @entity141 ( cucumber troop )			0
or , even worse , a @entity143 ( carnival team )			0
ultimately , to be @entity8 you need to temper success with pessimism and criticism			1
after a 7 - 1 victory over @entity1 you have to warn against complacency in the final and you must acknowledge the team still has weaknesses			0
people from other countries often can not understand this			0
it is why @entity123 were furious when @entity122 said that the @entity123 had no chance of winning the @entity57			1
he was not trying to be mean			0
he was just being @entity8 and guess what , he took @entity158 further than most fans predicted			1
so here 's to @entity8 football strategy , team lingo and pessimism , seeing themselves as the underdog against @entity166 even after winning 7 - 1			1

do you know your fly catcher from your banana pass ?
@entity8 success in the @entity57 is matched by its creative language
but to be @entity8 , winning must be tempered with pessimism , says @entity2 's @entity178
