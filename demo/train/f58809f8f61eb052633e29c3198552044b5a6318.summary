-- there are certain families -- like , say , the @entity2 and the @entity3 -- where coolness seems to be infused in the dna			0
i 'd like to add another to the list : the @entity8			0
@entity9 is the producer behind flicks like " @entity11 " and " @entity12 , " and son @entity13 grew up on his sets			1
" i was on the set of ' @entity12 ' when i was 11 days old			1
it had a profound effect on me , " @entity13 joked this week on " @entity16			1
" when he was in his early teens , @entity13 started working as a production assistant and his dad even cast him in a few small roles			1
" i was 13 and my dad gave me a scene in ' @entity24 ' kissing a girl -- and that was in fact my first kiss , " said @entity13			1
" my first kiss was directed by my father			2
you do n't know what it 's like to have to do eight takes of your first kiss while @entity34 's pointing a gun at you and your dad 's like , ' grab her a little more			0
' " while @entity13 probably could have busted into filmmaking by birthright , he decided against directing " @entity41 ? " which he was offered , and instead worked on short films to gain clout			1
" it 's interesting because i avoided working with my dad for a while because i was so sensitive of being accused of the idea of nepotism , " he said			0
" i remember when i was 19 years old i started a desk calendar company to pay for my first short film just so i could say one day my daddy did n't pay for my first short film			0
and i really established myself through the film festival world , starting at @entity54 and lots of film festivals and really took on a different style of film from my father			0
" soon , @entity13 directed " @entity59			1
" then the amazingness that was " @entity61			2
" and now , of course , he is the @entity64 forerunner with his movie " @entity66 , " which is getting all sorts of critical acclaim			1
" @entity66 " is the first project the two worked on together			1
" i love my father and we have such a strong bond and i look up to him as a filmmaker and a storyteller , " said @entity13			1
" so it was great and when i see the credits and it says produced by @entity79 and @entity80 , my heart swells			2
it 's really , really cool			0
" @entity9 echoes that sentiment			2
" it 's great to be the producer of this kind of movie and sort of share in its success and the goodwill that comes with it , " he said			2
" but as a parent it 's kind of this remarkable emotional moment that 's kind of hard to describe			0
" and it 's not like @entity9 's career is over -- he has a script in the works for " @entity96 " and the word on the street is that @entity99 will be making a cameo in it as a ghost himself			0
could this family be any cooler ? @entity104 all rights reserved			0
