-- the lawyer representing two @entity3 prisoners entering the 70th day of a hunger strike said his clients were nearing death and accused an @entity8 high court of procrastination in delivering a ruling that could save their lives			1
" their medical condition has gone from very bad to extremely worse , " @entity12 said of clients @entity14 , 27 , and @entity15 , 33 , " i believe what the court is doing here is trying to break the will of both prisoners so they will back down in their hunger strike			1
" @entity3 protest detention policy @entity14 and @entity24 are among the estimated 1,600 to 2,000 palestinians detained in @entity8 prisons staging a mass hunger strike to protest prison conditions and the practice of administrative detention , a controversial @entity8 military practice that allows authorities to detain people indefinitely			1
the process also allows for detention based on secret evidence , and there is no requirement to charge the detainees or to allow them to stand trial			0
@entity14 and @entity44 , members of the @entity43 - based militant group @entity42 , have been in custody for nine months and 22 months , respectively , under administrative detention			1
an @entity8 foreign ministry spokesman , @entity48 , told @entity0 that both men " were arrested for their direct involvement in promoting terror " and suggested that administrative detention constituted " the only available means to thwart the danger " the men posed to @entity8			2
looking pale and weak , both men appeared in wheelchairs before the @entity8 high court thursday while their lawyers petitioned the judges that they be released , arguing that their continued detention was illegal and that their deteriorating medical conditions should be taken into consideration			0
the court was expected to rule on the matter sunday , but no decision was forthcoming			0
@entity66 , a project coordinator for @entity67 , an @entity8 group advocating on behalf of the hunger striking prisoners , said both prisoners " are in a life - threatening condition " and continued to refuse to be given minerals or liquids			2
" there is no documented history of any person who survived without food or supplements beyond 75 days , " @entity66 said			0
according to a spokeswoman for the @entity8 prison service , @entity14 is being held at an @entity8 hospital while @entity44 is being cared for at prison medical facility			1
more than 4,500 @entity3 prisoners are in @entity8 prisons for a variety of offenses , ranging from rock - throwing to murder			1
of these , about 300 are being held in administrative detention , according to rights groups			0
the vast majority of prisoners refusing to eat began their protest on april 17 , while a handful have been without food for longer			0
while hunger strikes are not a new tactic of @entity3 resistance , a series of recent and high - profile cases have brought increased attention to the practice and served as a rallying cry for @entity3 , who have staged multiple protests in the @entity106 and @entity43 in support of prisoners			2
