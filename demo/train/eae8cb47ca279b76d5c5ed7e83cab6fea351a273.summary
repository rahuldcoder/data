@entity0 , @entity1 -- two explosions rocked an anti-government protest in the @entity1 capital of @entity0 on friday , wounding more than two dozen people , security and health officials said			1
the blasts went off as protesters were marching in the streets , said lt. gen. @entity12 , the national security chief			1
the cause was n't immediately clear			2
twenty - eight people were wounded and taken to hospitals , according to the @entity16 , a medical unit monitoring the political unrest in @entity1			0
demonstrators demanding the resignation of prime minister @entity21 began their latest round of rallies -- dubbed the " @entity0 shutdown " -- in the capital monday			1
but their numbers have shrunk over the course of the week			1
roughly 12,000 protesters were on the streets friday , @entity12 said			2
that 's a fraction of the 170,000 people the government estimated had assembled monday evening			0
demonstrators say their numbers are far higher than official estimates			0
outbreaks of violence have flared around the protests this week			1
on tuesday night , authorities reported the nonfatal shooting of two protesters , bus burnings , an assault on police officers and an explosive device being thrown at an opposition leader 's house			2
@entity47 , a spokesman for the main protest group , said the blasts friday were the first attack on marches in daylight on a public street			2
he said the first explosion took place about 30 meters from @entity57 , the leader of the protest group , and generated a lot of smoke			0
but the situation was n't too chaotic , he said			0
marchers continued on to the @entity63 area , one of their main rallying points			0
political crisis the protests this week caused some disruption in central @entity0 , but large areas of the sprawling capital city remain unaffected			1
the government has deployed about 20,000 security personnel throughout the city			2
rights groups , the @entity74 and the @entity75 have called on @entity1 authorities and anti-government protesters to respect human rights and avoid violence during the mass demonstrations			1
since demonstrations against @entity21 's government began in november , eight people have died and more than 450 have been wounded , according to authorities			1
the country is still scarred by the severe 2010 civil unrest that left about 90 people dead			0
in a bid to resolve the current crisis , @entity21 dissolved the nation 's parliament last month and called for new elections to be held on february 2			1
but the move has done little to appease protesters			2
they have called on the prime minister to step down from her caretaker position and be replaced by an unelected " people 's council , " which would see through electoral and political changes			1
the opposition @entity100 has said it will boycott the elections			0
ambitious goal protest leaders have said they want to rid @entity1 of the influence of former prime minister @entity105 , the older brother of @entity21			1
that 's an ambitious goal in a country where every election since 2001 has been won by parties affiliated with @entity105 , a billionaire who built his political success on populist policies that appealed to @entity1 's rural heartland			0
@entity105 was ousted in a military coup in 2006 and has spent most of the time since then in exile overseas			0
if he returns , he risks a two - year prison sentence on a corruption conviction , which he says was politically motivated			0
the recent protests in @entity0 were prompted by a botched attempt by @entity21 's government to pass an amnesty bill that would have opened the door for her brother 's return			1
that move added fuel for critics who accuse her of being nothing more than her brother 's puppet , an allegation she has repeatedly denied			0
opposition to @entity105 and @entity21 is strongest among the urban elites and middle class , particularly in @entity0			1
@entity105 's traditional support comes from the populous rural areas of north and northeast @entity1			0
his supporters , known as " red shirts , " support the holding of elections on february 2 .			0
