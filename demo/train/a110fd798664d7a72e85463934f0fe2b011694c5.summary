-- the thing that is hard to miss in @entity4 's @entity3 office are the quills			1
they 're in a mug , all 56 of them , each commemorating an appearance before the @entity11			1
in many of those cases , he was the standard bearer for conservatives			0
and a successful one ; he won 44 times			0
in fact , one of his most satisfying and famous wins was against @entity21 , the @entity22 and super-attorney @entity23 in the contested 2000 election			1
the rest , as they say , is history			0
@entity25 won , @entity23 lost			1
that is except in the movie " recount , " as they both joked to me			0
on wednesday , the two men won , this time together			0
they teamed up to argue against @entity36 , which bans gay marriage in @entity38			1
the legal team won in a stunning and clear decision			0
the plaintiffs , @entity47 district judge @entity46 wrote , " demonstrated by overwhelming evidence that @entity36 violates their due process and equal protection rights , " ruling it unconstitutional			1
now , the case will work its way up to the 9th @entity50 , and then to the high court			2
only @entity25 and @entity23 will be on the same side this time			1
in this case , @entity25 has been at the center in so many ways			1
disdained by many conservatives for arguing for gay marriage , some openly calling his decision as an act of pure ego or even treason			0
indeed , conservative legal analyst @entity63 told me , " it really is a betrayal of everything @entity4 has purported to stand for in his legal career in terms of constitutional principles			1
" but if you listen to @entity25 , his constitutional principles are exactly what this case -- and his decision to take it on -- is all about			1
" the constitution trumps everything , " he told me			0
" the @entity76 provides that equal protection of the laws shall be guaranteed to all citizens			0
" never mind that more than 40 states have voted against gay marriage or that a majority of the @entity47 public does n't support it			2
that was the case , he says , with a ban on interracial marriage struck down by the @entity47 @entity11 more than 40 years ago			1
" civil rights battles are won by fighting for civil rights			1
... we 're representing real people , who are being deprived of their constitutional rights , and we tell them to wait ? for what ? for how long ? " it 's interesting , in a way , because opposition to gay marriage increasingly looks like it cuts along a generational divide			0
one recent study showed that 58 percent of @entity47 ages 18 to 29 support gay marriage , while only 22 percent of those 65 and older feel the same way			2
so if the issue will gradually resolve itself , some say , why take it to court now ? " our choice is yes we will go to court to fight for you because your constitutional rights are being ignored			2
... " @entity25 told me			2
" or we could tell [ gay couples ] why do n't you wait for years , why do n't you wait for another generation ? " even some pro-gay marriage groups were skeptical at first , worried that @entity25 and @entity23 were setting the cause up for failure			1
still other legal scholars say that the two super-lawyers are driven by ego and relish that one last shot at arguing an historic case before the court			2
both men cringe at that			0
and what about the charge that the two lawyers figure they can game the high court -- even a conservative one ? ah , says @entity25			1
" we 're not taking for granted any votes on the @entity11			2
we have so much respect for the judges that are hearing this case and the justices of the @entity11 that will hear this case , none of whom have made up their minds			1
" is he sure ? " yes , " he smiles			0
" they have not heard the arguments			0
" now they almost certainly will			0
and @entity25 will get his 57th quill			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity152 .			0
