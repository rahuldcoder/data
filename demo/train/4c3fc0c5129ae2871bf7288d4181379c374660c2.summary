-- the summers of my youth were filled with the kinds of activities that were common to every kid in the 80s but are considered almost death - defying these days : tree climbing , bike riding without a helmet , and daylong road trips spent in the backseat of the family car , where we bounced around like @entity14 , nary a seat belt in sight			2
@entity17 and her dad , @entity18 , at her home in @entity20			1
still , my mother was safety - obsessed about some things , like swimming lessons			1
year after year , she forced me to take them at our local pool in @entity28			2
having to go against my will seemed all the more unfair to me , since my mother could not swim and was actually afraid of the water			1
but my mother reasoned that if water came between her children and their safety , she would be helpless			1
" i ca n't save you , " she would calmly state in answer to my pleas to bow out of the lessons			1
" so i 'm going to do everything in my power to make sure you can save yourself			2
" @entity0 : mother - daughter relationships it 's no wonder she embraced this philosophy of self - reliance			1
she knew how unexpectedly life can rob you of someone you care about			2
my parents adopted me as an infant and went on to have a biological child -- my brother , @entity51 -- a couple of years later			1
my dad was an electrician , and he died in an accident on the job when i was three			1
after his death , my mother had to raise us alone , and she was acutely aware that she was truly on her own , with no backup plan			1
she was fiercely strong and yet constantly fearful			2
i have almost no memories of my father			1
he was a former industrial - arts teacher whom my mother dated off and on for much of my childhood			1
@entity51 and i were n't his biggest fans			1
he was a man of strict rules , while my mom 's approach could be more properly deemed overindulgent leniency			1
ireport.com : share your bonding with dad memories we resented having to share the spotlight with him -- a sentiment that was particularly strong every @entity77 morning , when we had to wait for him to arrive before we could open gifts			2
( there is little a man can do to endear himself to children less than delaying @entity77 - morning gratification			0
) and when they stopped dating , when i was 15 , i was n't unhappy to see him go			1
@entity0 : small , helpful gestures with big impact then , on february 18 , 1991 , when i was 17 , my mother suddenly died of a brain aneurysm			1
one minute she was laughing with friends , enjoying an evening out ; the next , she was unconscious on the floor			0
just 19 hours later , she was dead , leaving my 15 - year - old brother and me orphans			1
in the moments of shock and horror that followed , my relatives all gathered in the hospital , and i went home with only a close friend for company ( @entity51 followed a while later )			0
we spent that night on our own			0
i was numb ; it had all happened so fast			0
i could barely think beyond the immediate moment			0
the next morning , my grandfather , aunts , and uncles were still immersed in their own mourning			0
@entity109 - shocked as i was , i knew i had to let people know what had happened			0
i saw my mother 's address book lying where she had set it only days before and started dialing			2
one of the phone numbers i found was @entity18 's			1
even though he lived about an hour away , it felt like he was there in an instant			0
as soon as he walked in , he took charge -- and took care of @entity51 and me			2
among other small kindnesses , he gave me a credit card and said , " why do n't you buy something to wear to the funeral ? " he gave me permission to be a 17 - year - old -- to focus on the more mundane issue of what i was going to wear instead of weighty adult concerns			1
@entity0 : @entity132 gift ideas generally , when children are orphaned , a family member comes forward to take them in			0
this did n't happen in our case			2
everyone had a good reason , i suppose			0
my mom 's father was too old to assume responsibility for us ; my mother 's sister and her husband had three kids of their own and were n't able to take in any others ; her other two siblings were both single and worked long hours			1
the guardian named in my mother 's will was a babysitter that none of us had seen in 15 years			2
but i can tell you this : abandonment , even for very good reasons , feels awful			0
it was heartbreaking and terrifying to have lost the person we loved most and then to be set adrift			0
@entity164 passed and it felt like our relatives could offer no reassurances			0
the only news we got was that if @entity51 and i remained without a guardian , we would have to enter foster care			0
our mother was gone , and there was nothing we could do to save ourselves			2
and , once again , there was @entity18			1
after the funeral , he was a constant presence			2
he made sure that food filled the cupboards , the bills were paid , and the lawn was mowed			0
( @entity18 's adult daughter , @entity182 , pitched in and took care of his house			1
) he made sure i went back to school even when it was the last thing i wanted to do			0
his overbearing personality -- the trait i had hated the most -- is what comforted me the most and got me through those difficult days			0
@entity18 says that @entity182 came up with the idea to make his role with @entity51 and me official -- he could become our guardian			1
he was on board right away			0
@entity18 still says he never considered not doing it ; caring for us was simply the right thing to do			1
one day he made us his offer			0
in a moment where the grief of loss and the pain of being unwanted threatened to capture my very breath , this man , whose only tie to us was having dated my mother , said he would be honored to take us in			2
from that moment on , everything was different			0
his girlfriend , @entity210 , threw us a " guardian party " when the paperwork became official			0
it was just a small gathering , but it made us feel special			0
i received a key chain with my initials , and i remember thinking that the idea behind it was so lovely			0
over the years , @entity18 has become not merely a legal guardian but a real father to me			1
when i fell into depression in college , unable to get past thoughts of my mother and all i had lost , he was there to listen			1
when my husband , @entity225 , and i bought our first house , @entity18 spent weekends installing insulation and repairing our gutters			1
he never wrote me off as a good , mature kid who could handle everything herself			0
he walked the line between trusting me and recognizing when i might need help			2
and what more could you want from a father than that ? his was an unconventional path to parenthood , to say the least			2
it is not by birth or adoption that i consider this man to be my father ; it is n't even through his presence in my childhood			1
it is rather by sheer good luck on my part			0
before he made that generous offer , i felt as though i had lost my mooring and the waters were flooding in ; afterward , i simply felt rescued			0
if my mother had taught me to be strong and depend on myself , @entity18 imparted his own lesson -- that the world will provide for you , even when you least expect it			1
eight years after @entity18 stepped forward , he walked me down the aisle			1
four years after that , i gave birth to his first granddaughter , @entity258			0
( @entity18 's legal name is @entity260			1
) the name is a reminder of my saved past and a promise for the future , and i hope one day @entity258 will see that as well			0
because as much as i plan to teach her to swim ( indeed , she 's now six and enrolled in lessons ) , i also want her to know this : no matter how fast the waters rise , no matter how hard it may be to keep her head above the waves , someone will throw her a line			0
