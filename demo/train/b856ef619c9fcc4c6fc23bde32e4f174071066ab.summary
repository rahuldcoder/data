@entity0 -- so finally , after long drawn out negotiations , @entity4 chancellor @entity3 and @entity6 president @entity5 seem to have reached some consensus on the recapitalization of @entity10 banks			1
however , they are unable to give us the blueprint of the agreement until the end of the month , just ahead of the @entity17 meeting in @entity18 in early november			2
and it is not yet clear if the other 15 eurozone member countries will agree on the plans			0
this is nail - biting stuff -- the world really does not have time to wait			1
this financial crisis is more to do with the strength and stability of the banks than it has to do with @entity29 or any other philandering economy			1
if the banks are well capitalized , then the storm can be ridden through			1
but the longer the @entity34 takes to make decisions about sovereign debt the more damaged the banks will become			1
the strong banks will want to attract fresh private capital and the weak will be reliant of public and taxpayers ' money			1
it has become increasingly clear is that there are far too many banks in @entity10			1
this crisis provides a classic opportunity to cut the number of banks by at least 30 %			1
the @entity34 should use its powers to force distressed banks into the arms of those banks with solid balance sheets			1
clients and customers of banks not capable of meeting their financial obligations due to the toxic state of their balance sheets must be protected , with their assets and liabilities being transferred to safe havens -- regardless of the potential damage to existing shareholders			2
beyond @entity29 , banks in @entity68 and @entity69 are in need of rationalization because of the respective size of their economies			2
for instance , the assets of the vulnerable cajas must be swept up by the four main @entity69 banks			1
in @entity4 there are also far too many landesbanks , or savings banks			1
some are very strong , but there are plenty which have no place independently going forward			0
quick action will restore confidence			0
the model used by the @entity89 government to protect the customers of @entity91 should probably be adopted as the norm in the next few years			0
if a bank 's situation looks dire it should be closed and the business dissolved into : " @entity97 in @entity98			0
" the banking industry is likely to look totally different in 10 years time			2
the large banks will be focused on corporate and investment banking and investment management , and retail banking will be dominated by large cash rich companies			2
look at @entity107 -- it has a decent banking base			0
why could n't the likes of @entity110 , @entity111 , and even @entity112 provide the best banking services imaginable ? these companies ' attention to the analysis of customer relations management is superb			0
they understand the nuances and foibles of retailer better than any other sector by a country mile			0
surely our money would be very safe in these very competent hands ? this may not happen soon , but it 's possible in the future			0
meanwhile , @entity131 's government has agreed to pay â ‚ ¬ 4.5 billion for the retail banking business of @entity133 , a dominant municipality lender			0
@entity131 , @entity6 and @entity135 leaders have drawn up a guarantee for @entity133 's interbank and bond funding , of up to â ‚ ¬ 90 billion over 10 years			1
the markets are now waiting for results from other banks , including @entity142 's on thursday			2
next week , @entity143 will be in the spotlight			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity147			0

the @entity4 and @entity6 leaders seem to have reached some consensus on @entity10 banks ' recapitalization
but there is no *clarity* around the plan , and the world does not have time to wait
there are too many banks in @entity10 , and the weak ones should be swept up , or fail
