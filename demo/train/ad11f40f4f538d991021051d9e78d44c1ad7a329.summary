they bought 5,000 shares at the initial price of $ 44 ; two days later , shares were trading at $ 64 , @entity4 said			2
the network reported the investment came at the same time a piece of legislation that was opposed by credit - card companies was making its way through the @entity2			1
" @entity34 has never done more for consumers nor has the @entity34 passed more critical reforms of the credit card industry than under the @entity38 of @entity1 , " @entity1 spokesman , @entity31 , said in a statement soon after the report aired sunday night			1
" it is very troubling that 60 minutes would base their reporting off of an already - discredited conservative author who has made a career of out attacking @entity44 , " he added			2
@entity4 said it used as a starting point for its story the research of @entity49 , a fellow at the @entity50 , a conservative think tank at @entity51			2
about a year ago , he began work on a book about " soft corruption " in @entity56 , @entity4 reported			2
the network said it had independently verified the material it used			0
@entity1 's spokesman criticized the @entity4 story for failing to note that the " legislation in question was reported out of the @entity63 on october 3 , 2008 -- the day the @entity2 was consumed in passing @entity64 and also the last day the @entity2 was in session before the november election			1
" it also failed to note that in september 2008 , the @entity2 passed the @entity68 , @entity31 said			0
" in the next @entity34 , the @entity2 and @entity70 passed and president @entity71 signed the @entity68 and the @entity73 legislation , which included a stronger , more direct approach to addressing swipe fees , " the spokesman said			0
in addition to @entity1 , the @entity4 report took a look at the investments of of @entity14 and @entity13			1

at the same time , @entity14 bought options funds , betting markets would go down , @entity4 said			1
he also traded @entity91 stock , and roughly a third of @entity91 's business is in financial services , @entity4 reported			0
@entity14 declined to talk to @entity4 , but his office provided a statement that said the representative never trades on non-public information , or financial services stock			2
meanwhile , @entity13 , who in 2009 was the @entity100 , bought health - insurance stocks during the health care debate , all of which increased in value after the so - called public option was killed , @entity4 reported			1
@entity13 was very much against the public option			0
he also declined to be interviewed , but spoke to @entity4 ' @entity108 at a press conference			0
" i have not made any decisions on day - to - day trading activities in my account -- and have n't for years			0
i do n't -- i do not do it , have n't done it and would n't do it , " he said			0
a senior @entity2 @entity117 aide told @entity0 that @entity13 's financial adviser bought a range of blue chip stocks around the same time -- not just health care stocks -- after he closed out the retirement account from his small business			0
" the idea that the @entity117 leader in the @entity2 opposed the public option -- policy favored by the left of the left -- for personal profit is , frankly , stupid , " said the aide			0
