-- if you 've been to the movies recently , you 've probably been pummeled with trailers for interchangeable all - star action movies : " @entity5 , " " @entity6 " and " @entity7			1
" mercenaries are in this year , and khaki is the new black			0
" @entity7 " is first out of the blocks , and it 's a cheerfully vulgar shoot - ' em - up that does n't have a serious bone in its pumped - up body			1
based on @entity18 's @entity17 comic book ( itself loosely inspired by the old @entity20 comic ) , the movie does n't really flow ; it just spurts out in quick , oily jets			1
it 's actually less like a comic book and more like a 90 - minute trailer : all the best bits stuck end to end and the filler condensed into a pithy line or ( better yet ) a clubby music cue			1
( the kills ' " @entity36 " comes up twice -- once for a fight scene and then again for a sex scene -- but there 's no doubt the fight is the turn - on , and it lasts much longer , too			2
) if you 've seen the trailer , you 'll feel you 're halfway there , and if you caught co-writer @entity40 in " @entity41 " a couple of years back , you 'll know what else is in store			0
the losers are some kind of @entity47 black ops squad , but only for a nanosecond			0
there are five of them , each with his own wardrobe fetish and each with a prescribed skill set : @entity55 is the leader ( @entity55 from " @entity56 " ) , and he looks good with one shirt - tail hanging out			1
@entity58 ( @entity59 ) is tech support and comic relief in a series of nasty t - shirts			1
@entity64 ( @entity65 ) is a sniper and never separated from his cowboy hat			0
@entity68 ( @entity69 ) is the driver and family man			0
@entity72 ( @entity71 , aka @entity73 from " @entity74 " ) is second - in - command , a knife expert with a scar down his cheek			0
they 're a bit lightweight in star power -- @entity59 is the biggest draw and the most fun -- and they 're not so badass that they 're willing to take out a @entity87 crime boss when they realize he 's surrounded himself with children			2
in rescuing the kids , the @entity7 seal their own death warrant with their controller , @entity93 , a super-patriot whose precise role in @entity97 intelligence is shrouded in secrecy but who has been written as a cross between @entity101 and @entity102 ( though @entity103 , who plays him , resembles a psychotically soft - spoken @entity105 )			2
left for dead in the jungle , the team is rescued , sort of , by a high - kicking beanpole with an open credit line			0
this is @entity111 ( @entity112 ) , and she hires the @entity7 to bring down @entity93 " how do i know i can trust you ? " @entity55 wants to know			1
" because if i was lying , i would n't have used the words ' suicide mission , ' " she very reasonably points out			0
locked into the faddish slam - cut video game look and filtered ( perhaps in deference to a string of @entity121 locations ) in malarial shades of green and yellow , " @entity7 " wants to seem cutting edge , though it clings to a quaint saturday morning serial black - and - white morality			2
@entity93 is n't just down on kids , he plans to get his paws on " next - generation " weapons , kick - start a war or two , destabilize the developing world and put the @entity97 back on top			0
laughable ! directed by @entity144 ( " @entity143 " ) , the movie musters a modicum of snap , crackle and pop , but the whole shooting match is delivered in such an assiduously shorthand style that when the smoke clears , it 's hard not to feel a teensy bit short - changed .			1

" @entity7 " is based on @entity18 's @entity17 comic book
film stars @entity59 , @entity55 , @entity69 and @entity112
it musters a modicum of snap , crackle and pop , but it 's hard not to feel short - changed
