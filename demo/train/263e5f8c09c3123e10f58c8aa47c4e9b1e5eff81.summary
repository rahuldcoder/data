when @entity1 shut down some access to the @entity3 this week , it was n't to keep employees from messing around on @entity5 or crafting personal e-mails on company time			1
instead , it was to get them to quit sucking up the company 's web bandwidth by listening to music and watching movies			1
in a memo tuesday , the company , which sells everything from @entity17 detergent to @entity18 to @entity20 batteries , told its 129,000 employees they can no longer use music - streaming site @entity23 or movie site @entity25 at work			1
" we are one of the more lenient companies in terms of providing access to the internet , but there are some sites which do n't serve a specific business purpose -- in this case , @entity25 and @entity23 , " @entity1 spokesman @entity28 said in an e-mail			1
" they are both great sites , but if you want to download movies or music , do it on your own time			2
" according to the memo , an internal report found that @entity1 employees were watching 50,000 five - minute @entity49 videos and listening to 4,000 hours of music on @entity23 on a typical day			1
at one point , the company 's web capacity was overtaxed , " requiring immediate interaction , " the memo said			2
since the company uses @entity49 as a tool to sell its products , @entity25 was banned instead in the effort to free up bandwidth			1
since the dawn of the internet age , companies have struggled with how to handle personal computer use while employees are on the clock			2
it 's not rare for companies , both large and small , to ban some or all personal internet and even e-mail use			0
but as more and more businesses need web access to function ( and as web content becomes more data - intensive ) , many are struggling with a so - called bandwidth " spectrum crunch			0
" wireless carriers are also struggling with the issue			0
the growth of the smartphone and tablet markets have dramatically increased the amount of data being accessed at any given time			0
global mobile data traffic is just about doubling every year and will continue to do so through at least 2016 , according to @entity88 's @entity87 , the industry 's most comprehensive annual study			0
@entity91 , a steering committee member of an it professional group in @entity93 ( where @entity1 is based ) told the @entity94 that social networking and other personal computer use has become a serious concern at some companies , threatening to slow the flow of data			1
" effective it leaders need to address this within their companies now , " said @entity91			0
" it is not something to be ignored			0
" but it 's not just employees			0
companies themselves are using the web more			0
the rise of cloud computing means that a lot of data that once would have been stored internally is being accessed from the web , sometimes multiple times in a day			1
" as @entity1 drives to become one of the most digitally advanced companies in the world , more and more of our business processes , applications and systems are being web enabled , " @entity28 said in the e-mail			2
" that in turn makes bandwidth capacity and availability even more critical			0
" @entity129 notes that @entity25 and @entity23 competitors -- such as @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 -- are n't blocked , although the company says tuesday 's move may just be a first step .			1
