@entity0 -- @entity3 officials said tuesday they wo n't arbitrarily free 33,000 inmates and they will submit plans to the federal courts in two weeks specifying ways to remedy prison overcrowding under a @entity11 @entity10 order this week			1
" the goal is not to release anybody early , " said spokeswoman @entity12 of the @entity14			0
" nobody wants to do that			0
" " nobody wants to open the door and let everyone out , " she added			0
the state 's plan to reduce prison overcrowding is still being prepared for a special federal three - judge panel , @entity12 said			1
@entity3 's 33 adult prisons now hold 143,435 inmates , she said			1
@entity12 said that state plan may or may not include ongoing state initiatives that are targeting the overcrowding issue , which the @entity11 @entity10 said in a 5 - 4 decision monday fall " below the standard of decency			1
" one such initiative is the so - called @entity36 law that gov. @entity37 signed in april that will transfer low - level offenders from state prisons to county jails			2
but the " public safety realignment " plan does n't have state funding yet , which could be stymied by how the state treasury deals with a staggering $ 25 billion budget deficit			1
" we particularly need the support and cooperation of the legislature with the immediate funding and implementation of @entity36 , " @entity14 secretary @entity46 said in a statement			2
" the governor has repeatedly called for full and constitutionally protected funding of this bill to allow certain offenders to serve their incarceration and parole term under local supervision			2
" in ongoing state remedies that may be submitted to the federal courts for approval , the state has already transferred 10,088 inmates to contracted out - of - state facilities to reduce sleeping in gymnasiums , dayrooms and other places not intended for housing , according to the corrections department			1
in may 2007 , the state authorized construction of the @entity76 in @entity77 , which will provide medical and mental health treatment with more than 1,722 beds for inmates , the corrections department said			2
more than 18,000 beds are planned to provide health care to thousands of other inmates , the agency said			0
these measures may also be sent to the federal court panel , @entity12 said			0
on monday , the @entity10 affirmed a federal order telling @entity3 to reduce its overflowing prison population			1
the case was a classic battle over state versus federal authority , focusing on whether @entity11 courts can step in and essentially run state prisons when officials have repeatedly violated basic constitutional guarantees afforded inmates			1
the issue came down to a sharply divided debate between public safety concerns and individual rights , a debate that goes into how the three branches of government should balance competing state interests			2
the swing vote was justice @entity106 , who wrote of the " continuing injury and harm resulting from these serious constitutional violations , " including as many as 156,000 people crammed into correctional facilities designed to hold about half that many			0
he said that " needless suffering and death have been the well - documented result			0
over the whole course of years during which this litigation has been pending , no other remedies have been found to be sufficient			0
" in dissent , justice @entity120 warned that any mass release of inmates to alleviate overcrowding would be " gambling with the safety of the people of @entity3			1
" the state now has a two - year window to comply , with the clock starting monday			0
officials have not fully explained how their ongoing inmate reduction plan will need to be modified to meet the federal order			2
in a statement issued monday afternoon , @entity3 gov. @entity37 said he would take " all steps necessary to protect public safety " in resolving the prison overcrowding crisis			1
prison overcrowding is a nationwide problem , but @entity3 's dilemma is unique in its massive scope and time frame			1
there is general agreement that the prison conditions across @entity3 are disturbing			1
prisoners are stacked three deep in 6 - by - 9 - foot cells designed to hold only one			0
open spaces meant to be gymnasiums and clinics have been transformed into crowded encampments with bunks and unsanitary conditions			0
suicides occur once every eight days , on average			0
@entity3 has the nation 's largest prison system , and the state says it has reduced the prison population to meet overcrowding concerns			1
but a special federal court panel had ordered 36,000 to 46,000 more inmates released or transferred quickly , about a quarter of the total			0
that figure has now been reduced to 33,000 , achieved through ongoing state remedies to overcrowding , according to @entity12 , the state prisons spokeswoman			1
despite some recent drops , the prison population in the state has increased by about 75 % in the past two decades			2
two lawsuits -- one filed in 1990 , the other in 2001 -- say overcrowding is the core cause of what has become a domino effect of unsafe and unhealthy conditions for those on both sides of the iron bars			0
state legislators and corrections officials have admitted that the prisons violate the ban on " cruel and unusual punishment " contained in the @entity187 , and have organized more than 20 panels and commissions to address the crisis			1
the special federal court in 2009 had ordered the state to shrink the prison population from the current 200 % over capacity to a maximum of 137.5 % , and to accomplish that in two years			2
the state was given wide latitude to meet the goal , but the court was adamant the state do it without delay and without excuse			0
the task was made more difficult by the state budget crisis and a national economic downturn that have created turmoil over funding solutions not just in prisons , but also in education , transportation and social programs			1
