-- @entity1 snatched a last - gasp winner to eliminate @entity4 co-hosts @entity5 and keep their own quarterfinal hopes alive with a 2 - 1 victory in rain - drenched @entity8 on wednesday night			1
@entity9 , left , and @entity12 goalkeeper @entity11 battle for the ball with @entity14 of @entity1			1
@entity14 scored with a deflected effort in the third minute of time added on to set up a group a finale against the @entity18 on sunday to determine who takes the second quarterfinal place behind @entity21			1
the @entity22 came from behind after @entity23 gave the @entity12 a 32nd - minute lead , with substitute striker @entity25 heading a 57th - minute equalizer through the hands of goalkeeper @entity11			1
the @entity30 stadium had been flooded by a deluge early in the match , with the downpour continuing until just before half - time			1
the treacherous conditions made defending a nightmare for both teams , and @entity14 almost put @entity1 ahead in the 29th minute with a farcical effort			1
with minimal visibility in the heavy rain , @entity11 punched a vicious free - kick by stand - in captain @entity42 onto the head of the 21 - year - old winger -- but the ball bounced to safety off the outside of the post			2
however , it was the @entity12 who adapted the better and they took the lead through the veteran @entity52			0
he was on hand to awkwardly steer home from close range with his weaker right foot after @entity57 -- who like @entity59 is of @entity22 origin -- beat the offside trap to collect a long pass from defender @entity63			1
@entity57 calmly check inside the defense in the penalty area and sent a low cross towards @entity52 -- who had to wait anxiously at the far post as the ball was held up in a huge puddle of water			0
@entity52 had earlier been denied by @entity1 goalkeeper @entity72 , who also did well to tip a swerving free - kick by @entity74 around the post			1
@entity52 also missed an even easier chance than the goal he scored in the 34th minute when he stabbed the ball wide of the post following a superb right - wing cross by @entity80 which cut out the defense and goal custodian			2
@entity1 , sensing a lucky escape , came out after the break with renewed purpose and posed a greater threat as the pitch slowly drained of the excess water			2
@entity25 justified his second - half introduction when he rose highest to meet @entity91 's superb inswinging cross from the left flank , and @entity11 could only palm the powerful header into the back of the net			0
tempers flared as both sides went in search of the victory , but there was no repeat of the violent scenes that followed @entity5 's @entity104 playoff victory against the @entity22 in november 2005			1
@entity72 made another superb save from @entity59 , and @entity1 held off the @entity12 onslaught before @entity14 cut in from the right and fired a shot from just outside the penalty area which clipped the heels of @entity9 and looped over the helpless @entity11			1
" i did wish for rain to stop			0
i did pray to @entity113 for that , " @entity1 coach @entity111 told reporters			0
" we could n't predict mud in the middle of the summer			0
" it 's not easy to come back from a goal down at the @entity119 , considering we hit the woodwork once			0
but we fought a lot in the second half and we created many opportunities			0
" he added : " tonight we reminded everyone a little bit about @entity1			2
against the @entity18 , we will be unforgettable			0
" defeat was a bitter blow for @entity5 , whose fellow co-hosts @entity131 will also be eliminated on thursday if they lose to @entity132 in @entity133			2
" of course the disappointment is huge , " @entity5 coach @entity134 said			0
" but i ca n't blame it on any player or anyone else			0
