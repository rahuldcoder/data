@entity0 is a proud new grandfather and fascinated by his unlikely new hobby : painting			1
but some things have n't changed a bit : the trademark smirk when he is amused , a squinty glare when he does n't appreciate the question -- and a quick turn to humor when the conversation turns to " legacy , " including the scars of @entity13 or the cloud of @entity15			1
" @entity19 will ultimately judge the decisions that were made for @entity13 and i 'm just not going to be around to see the final verdict , " the two - term president told @entity17 in a wide - ranging interview			1
" in other words , i 'll be dead			2
" on thursday , every living president will be on hand for the dedication of the @entity26 in @entity27			2
one , of course , will be his father , @entity29 ; the other three , @entity30 -- presidents @entity32 , @entity33 and @entity34			2
by the @entity35 : presidential libraries the 43rd president said he has learned lessons from his predecessors about how to make a mark after leaving the @entity41			1
" you learn that life does n't end after you 're president , " @entity0 said			1
" in other words , you 're going a hundred miles an hour and , and , in my case , we woke up in @entity47 and now it 's going zero			1
and so the challenge is how to live life to its fullest			2
" in my case , i 've chosen to do so outside the limelight			2
on the other hand , i am confident that when this chapter of our life is finished , that we 'll both be able to say that we 've advanced the cause of peace and freedom and -- and the human -- and helped improve the human condition			2
" remembering 43 : ' @entity0 tended to ... follow strong people ' in july , @entity0 visited @entity63 and @entity64 to promote a health initiative that focuses on cervical and breast cancer prevention and treatment			1
he also helped create the @entity68 , which focuses on long - term economic reconstruction projects that create jobs and promote economic opportunity			2
@entity72 said her husband rarely itches to add his voice to the daily political debate			1
the former president said he knows the library dedication will re-stir the debate about his presidency , and he conceded the library is in part an effort by him and supporters to influence history 's verdict			1
but he predicted visitors would find it " more objective " than they might have imagined and he showed little interest in revisiting flash points like @entity13 , @entity15 or the 2008 financial crisis			2
or the scorn with which many look back at the @entity0 presidency			1
a glimpse at a @entity41 before everything changed " you know , i 'm really not that concerned about why people did what during my presidency			1
" i 'm more concerned about being an effective person for the rest of my life			2
" i know this , that @entity72 and i gave the presidency eight years of our life			1
we gave it our all			2
made the best judgment calls i could			2
i did n't compromise my principles			2
and i 'm a content man			2
and i am excited about what we 're going to do here			0
" the library path is a quick reminder of how everything changed on a crisp september morning			1
one early exhibit is filled with children 's books -- education reform was to be a major first term priority			1
@entity123 : @entity0 came through on @entity15 then , the dress @entity72 wore to a state dinner on september 6 , 2001 , for then - @entity127 president @entity126			1
candidate @entity0 had promised a humble foreign policy , with a heavy focus on the @entity130			1
one step past images of that festive dinner takes you into the horror and carnage of september 11 , including a twisted beam from the second tower of the @entity139 and the bullhorn the president used during his now iconic visit to the rubble at ground zero a few days after the attacks			0
given his heavy focus on terrorism as president , we began the conversation with his thoughts when he heard the news of the explosions at the @entity155 finish line			0
" i was reminded that evil exists , " @entity0 said			1
" and that there are people in the world who are willing to kill innocent people to advance a cause			0
" history 's jury is still out on @entity0 the @entity164 is a centerpiece of the library tour			1
visitors can relive big @entity0 administration policy debates , and read and listen to some of the advice given to the president at the time			1
then they can pick a course of action			0
never known as one to second - guess himself , the former president conceded problems in administering the @entity13 war but was adamant he believed history would embrace the decision to go to war			0
a @entity0 @entity41 before everything changed asked if he is now convinced he launched the war with too small a @entity184 military force , @entity0 said , " there are some -- you know , tactics that need to be revisited			1
on the other hand , the removal of @entity190 was the right decision			0
the @entity194 people have a chance to live in a free society			0
" he said he will take no offense if museum visitors come to a different conclusion			0
" the museum is a -- it does give people the opportunity to hear the different points of view that i got on these particular issues , " he said			0
" the purpose of which is not to try to defend the policy			0
the purpose of which is to try to show people what it 's like to be the president			1
and how you make decisions			0
" another exhibit includes former secretary of state @entity219 explaining enhanced interrogation tactics used against some suspected @entity222 terrorists taken into @entity184 custody			0
stand back : @entity0 is ' busting stereotypes ' veterans of @entity0 administration policy battles might wonder why former vice president @entity227 does not have that role in the library , given his strong support for the tougher interrogations , including waterboarding in a few cases			1
@entity227 is attending the ceremonies , and while he has written and talked openly about differences with his former boss late in their @entity41 years , president @entity0 brushed aside any talk of bad blood			1
" no , it was never strained , " @entity0 said			1
" i think that 's the mythology that we 've escaped			1
in other words , there 's a mythology in @entity245			1
" reminded of @entity227 's recollections in his book , especially over the president 's refusal to pardon longtime @entity227 aide and friend @entity250 , the former president added this to the talk of tensions : " not really			1
yeah , he did n't agree with that decision			0
but i do n't -- you know -- people ought to look at the total picture			0
and we 're friends then and friends now			0
" by the numbers : the @entity0 family other highlights of the interview : on his debate just before @entity15 hit about whether to overrule @entity270 's governor and send in federal troops : @entity17 : people were telling you , " mr. president , maybe you need to declare an insurrection			1
which would have been pretty difficult			0
not pretty di -- very difficult			0
yeah , so i -- it just points out the dilemma			0
... @entity17 : do you wish in hindsight you had done it ? @entity0 : no , not really			1
i 'm -- you know , i get -- there 's no telling how history would have recorded the situation had i declared an insurrection			1
i can tell you the decibel level would have risen even louder than it was			0
hopefully people will go to the @entity164 and say , " wow , i did n't understand that			0
" or , " i now understand it better			0
" on whether he feels personal redemption now that many @entity299 leaders are pushing immigration policies that mirror his failed proposals : @entity0 : no , i do n't			1
i do n't really view it as redemption , i view it as smart			0
and i was real proud of my little brother being out there , you know -- pushing the issue			0
because he understands the issue well			0
eventually these problems will get solved			0
and a president just has to understand that not every issue gets solved during his presidency			1
but he can contribute to the ultimate solution			0
on whether that brother , former @entity317 gov. @entity316 , should seek the 2016 @entity299 nomination : @entity0 : well , big @entity316 , you know , he 's got a decision to make			1
and if i could make it for him , it 'd be , " run , " but i ca n't			0
and i do n't know what he 's going to do			2
he 'd be a great candidate and a great president			0
on plans for a third trip to @entity331 this summer : @entity0 : i think it 's important to set priorities in life			1
i always said that one of the principles that was important to me was human life			0
we went to @entity331 and saw people dying , needlessly dying			0
and there 's nothing more important , i think , and @entity72 thinks as well , to help somebody live			1
and so during my presidency i convinced @entity344 to spend taxpayers ' money to save lives not only from @entity348 but as well from malaria			2
and we want to continue that type of work with cervical cancer			0
finally , on his post-presidential hobby of painting : @entity72 : who would have thunk it ? @entity0 was looking for a pastime , actually , when he gave up smoking cigars			1
so he read @entity362 's book , " @entity363 " and he 's actually very good			2
he 's a very good painter			2
i am , i guess , tapping a part of the brain that , you know , certainly never used when i was a teenager			0
and i get the satisfaction out of completing a project			0
and i paint people 's pets			2
and i love to give them their pet as a gift			0
and i readily concede the signature is more valuable than the painting .			0
