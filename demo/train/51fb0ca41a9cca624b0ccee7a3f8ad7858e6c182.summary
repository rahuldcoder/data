-- @entity1 , mirror on the wall -- tell me my body faults , one and all			2
that 's what a lot of women ask their mirrors to tell them , at least until they get a boyfriend or a husband they can torture with the dreaded question , " does this dress ( or blouse , pair of pants , skirt , etc. ) make me look fat ? " but even when women get the answer to that no - win question , what can they do ? how do you disguise those thunder - thighs or flappy arms or muffin - top middles ? you might want to choose between high - fat and no - fat clothes			1
that 's right -- no - fat clothes			1
they 're the outfits that can take 10 pounds off your problem area , according to @entity35 , who wrote " how to never look @entity36			1
" her mantra is : " it 's not you , it 's your clothes			2
" " all women know the language of food , " says @entity35 , so she describes how to look your best in food terms			1
but not the old - fashioned terms of body shapes being either apple or pear , because women 's " body issues can range from a wide face all the way down to cankles			1
" it 's not just a matter of vanity ; the author cites research finding that fat can keep people from getting hired			1
the ingredients to her " never looking fat system " are : fabric , fit , styles and colors			2
high - fat clothes come in shiny metallic or sequin outfits in bright or neon colors that either fit too loose or too tight			1
low - fat clothes come in darker hues of silk or cotton or wool gabardine and fit perfectly			1
" i did n't want to sugar - coat anything , " says @entity35			1
she gives information not even your most blunt best friend would tell you about what will make you look your best or your worst			0
there also is a do n't you dare section in every chapter			0
@entity35 goes so far as to tell how the part in your hair or your eyewear choice can help you see a beautiful woman or @entity91 in the mirror			1
she says even women size 16 or 18 can look their best if they make the right choices			0
those begin with what 's under the outfits			0
" you need good supportive shapewear			0
it will slim you down , " she says , adding a good one will have a high waist , right under the bra band , and will go down to whatever your problem area is			0
to smooth out the dreaded back fat that can ruin your appearance , she suggests wearing a control camisole over your bra to " compress and flatten " the roll that could follow you everywhere			0
she also advises to not fall head over heels in love with a trend that is bad for you			0
" i do see a lot of women walking around and i wonder , how did she go out of the house in the morning looking at that ? " says @entity35			1
" they fall in love with a fashion trend even if it does n't work for them			0
... ' i know this is going to make me look fat , but i do n't care			0
' " @entity35 says the wrong trend can be brutal for a woman			2
" transparency is big now , but if you have fat , you do n't want the world to see that -- you want to cover it up			2
" she says the celebrities that always look good in their clothes are @entity139 and @entity140			0
but she notes that even if you 're rich and famous and in great shape , you do n't always make the best choices , even if you have a paid stylist to help			0
she noted two such fashion mistakes from the recent @entity145			0
@entity147 's gown with a big bustle and train was a bad , or " high - fat , " choice for a woman with a wide backside			1
and she said @entity155 's @entity154 dress of amethyst and lilac with rosettes on her bust was just a " really bad choice			0
" " they really should sue their stylists for malpractice , " says @entity35			2
or they could trade the stylist for @entity35 's book			1
@entity35 is married to @entity167 , assistant managing editor of @entity168 , which , like @entity0 , is a division of @entity169 .			2
