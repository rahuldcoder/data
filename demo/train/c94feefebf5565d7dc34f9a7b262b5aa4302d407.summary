-- @entity2 's @entity1 called for a " new debate " on the drug war and said the @entity5 must play an important role in that discussion			1
the presumptive president - elect spoke this week to @entity9 , host of @entity0 's " @entity10			1
" his comments will air sunday			0
" yes , i do believe we should open up a new debate regarding how to wage war on drug trafficking			0
personally , i 'm not in favor of legalizing drugs			0
i 'm not persuaded by that as an argument			0
however , let 's open up a new debate , a review , in which the @entity5 plays a fundamental role in conducting this review , " said @entity1			1
more than 47,500 people have died in drug - related violence since @entity27 , @entity2 's current president , made combating cartels a top priority when he took office in 2006			1
@entity1 has pledged to focus more on reducing violence and less on catching cartel leaders and blocking drugs from reaching the @entity5			2
" what we seek now in our new strategy is to adjust what 's been done up until now			2
it 's not a radical change			2
it 's to broaden the coverage and above all , the emphasis i aspire to of reducing the violence in our country , " he told @entity9			1
" i 'm persuaded that if we achieve the specialization in the work carried out by the various branches of the federal police and the inspector general 's office , waging war on impunity will allow us to combat crime , " he said			0
the presumptive president - elect also weighed in on @entity59 's immigration law , which allows police to check a person 's immigration status while enforcing other laws if " reasonable suspicion " exists that the person is in the @entity5 illegally			1
the controversial provision was recently upheld by the @entity5 @entity66			0
it struck down other parts of the law			0
" clearly , it seems to me that these are discriminatory laws that do n't recognize the contribution and the value of millions of immigrants , particularly from my country , who make enormous contributions to the @entity5 ' economic development			0
it 's clear to me that @entity2 must facilitate conditions for greater economic development through structural reforms , energy reforms , treasury reform , labor reform , in order to generate jobs and greater opportunities in my country , so that immigration is a decision and not a necessity for @entity2 , " he said			2
an official tally of returns friday confirmed @entity1 of the @entity96 , or @entity96 , as the winner of @entity2 's presidential election			2
final tally confirms @entity96 victory in @entity2 but until the country 's electoral tribunal ratifies the results -- and challenges are virtually assured -- he remains the presumptive president - elect			1
@entity1 's closest rival , @entity106 , has vowed to challenge the results , accusing the @entity96 of vote - buying , and said that he would take his complaints through the legal system			1
the federal electoral tribunal , known as @entity111 , will begin to accept complaints monday of voting irregularities			0
the tribunal will have until september 6 to complete its investigation and ratify -- or reverse -- the official election results			0
the new president will be sworn in december 1 .			1
