-- @entity2 voters tuesday rejected a controversial amendment that would have defined life as beginning at conception while @entity7 voters repealed a law that limited the collective bargaining rights of public workers , @entity0 projects			1
the two ballot measures had national implications as @entity14 voted in an off - year election			1
the @entity2 amendment would have made it impossible to get an abortion in the state and hampered the ability to get the morning - after pill or birth control pills that destroy fertilized eggs			1
disposing of unused fertilized eggs could also have become illegal , making in vitro fertilization treatments more difficult			2
national right to life groups opposed the measure and the @entity29 in @entity2 called it extreme			1
the @entity7 law limited the bargaining rights of police , teachers , firefighters and other public workers over salaries , workplace conditions and hours			1
it prohibited strikes and promotions based on seniority only , and required public workers to contribute at least 10 % of their income toward their pensions and at least 15 % to pay for their health care insurance			1
the @entity47 - controlled legislature passed the bill @entity49 gov. @entity49 signed it into law in march but a successful petition drive kept it from being enacted and placed it on the november ballot			1
@entity49 said tuesday night that it was clear that the people had spoken			0
" part of leading is listening to and hearing what people have to say to you , " he said			0
the vote was seen as a victory for unions and @entity65 , but @entity0 projects that @entity65 are taking a loss in @entity7 in a measure that exempts @entity69 from compulsory participation in the mandatory health care coverage portion of president @entity73 's health care reform law passed last year			1
since the measure is a state one and the health law is a federal one , it is unclear what impact it might have and it is seen as largely a protest vote			2
in other elections around the country : @entity0 projects that @entity2 's governor 's seat will stay in @entity47 hands as @entity47 lt. gov. @entity84 appeared to be on his way to victory over @entity88 mayor @entity87 , who would have been the state 's first @entity89 - @entity14 governor			1
@entity87 , who was elected the first black mayor of @entity88 in 2001 , was expected to spark a stronger than usual turnout in the @entity89 - @entity14 community			2
@entity84 will succeed @entity94 gov. @entity94 , who was barred by term limits from running again after serving two terms			0
in @entity99 , the state senator who wrote the controversial immigration law lost to a charter school superintendent in a recall election widely seen as a referendum on tough measures against illegal immigrants			2
the recall petition pitted @entity106 against fellow @entity47 @entity107			0
@entity107 led with 53.4 % of the vote with all precincts reporting while @entity106 got 45.3 %			0
@entity111 gov. @entity110 will win a second term , @entity0 projects , easily beating @entity47 state sen. @entity114 in a race that centered on jobs and the economy			0
@entity114 frequently criticized @entity110 's record on creating jobs and balancing the state budget			0
@entity110 kept a tally of the number of jobs that companies were bringing to the state on his website			0
while the abortion ballot initiative in @entity2 got the most attention , another constitutional amendment that @entity0 projects to pass will require voters to submit a government - issued photo id			1
@entity2 will be the 15th state to require photo ids to vote			2
such laws have become popular with @entity47 , who say they are trying to reduce voter fraud			0
@entity65 argue that @entity47 are trying to suppress voter turnout , especially among people who tend to vote for @entity65			0
@entity0 's @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , @entity140 , @entity141 and @entity142 contributed to this report .			0
