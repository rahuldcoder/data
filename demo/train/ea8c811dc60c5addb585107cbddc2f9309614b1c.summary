@entity0 : not only the capital of the happiest country on @entity4 -- officially -- but also probably the center of the designer goods universe			1
even the @entity8 decorations are tasteful			1
the festive season is also when the air is especially thick with " hygge " -- @entity13 's wooly , candle - lit version of coziness			1
no wonder @entity17 called the city wonderful -- twice			1
yes -- sorry -- that reference was impossible to avoid			1
the @entity13 are the happiest people on the planet it 's official			1
according to the @entity24 's @entity23 , @entity13 , with a score of 7.6 , beats every other country on a global happiness scale from zero to 10			1
the @entity29 , by contrast , is n't especially happy			2
it came in in 17th place , between @entity32 and @entity33			2
but do n't despair if you think @entity13 despair has been lost			2
there 's always @entity37 -- and @entity38 ( see below )			1
a lot of @entity41 cycle -- fast ever tried commuting to work by bike in a frenetic city such as @entity45 , @entity46 or @entity47 ? do it and you realize cyclists are still second - class citizens in many cities			1
the situation is reversed in @entity0 , where half of the people pedal to work			1
just as cyclists compete with cars in terms of numbers , so too they seem to try to beat them on speed			2
in other words , pedestrians should take care crossing a cycle lane			2
or you could join the two - wheeled masses			2
cycling is one of the best ways to explore the city , and you can take bikes on trains			2
it takes 15 minutes to travel from the airport to the city center by metro , and trains run 24 hours a day			0
@entity41 are also law - abiding			0
even at 3 a.m. on an icy cold night , with no traffic in sight , they 'll wait for the green light at pedestrian crossings			0
@entity0 is glittering with @entity84 stars it 's still hard to get a table at @entity87 , the " new @entity91 " restaurant that 's been named the @entity4 's @entity89 three times			1
there are , however , options			0
this small city boasts 15 @entity84 stars , and several @entity87 chefs have gone on to set up their own outfits with equally stimulating menus			0
a flourishing example of the latter is @entity101 ( @entity102 41 ; +45 3696 6609 ) , an experimental , basement restaurant on a street packed with food shops and eateries			0
another ( without a @entity84 star ) is @entity109 ( @entity110 100 ; +45 3215 5656 ) , a stripped - back industrial space that specializes in fish and seafood			0
other top @entity0 culinary stops include @entity115 ( @entity116 10 ; +45 3555 3344 ) where smørrebrød , the classic @entity13 open sandwich , is turned into a delicious work of art , and the @entity120 ( @entity121 6 ; +45 3312 1122 ) , which serves " smushi , " a fusion of sushi and smørrebrød			1
make dining reservations early -- most restaurants open for online bookings at least two months in advance			1
@entity41 tend not to dine late , meaning not a lot of places keep late hours			0
" @entity131 " is highly desirable this @entity13 word ( pronounced " hooga " ) loosely translates as " coziness			1
" it 's a warm , sociable feeling that comes to the fore in autumn and winter and that , for @entity13 , is one of the highest states to which humans can aspire			0
wool sweaters ( preferably organic ) , hats with earflaps , blazing log fires , strong ales in old wood - paneled bars and candles galore , even at breakfast , all conjure " hygge			1
home is where the @entity13 designer goods are @entity0 is rich with design - led stores selling trendy lights , ingenious kitchenware , cheerful home furnishings and exquisite glass and ceramics			1
these five shops are worth a visit : @entity161 ( @entity162 9 ) now in its 11th year , this purveyor of simple but good - looking furniture and accessories epitomizes the @entity13 dream to be " solid , straightforward , joyful and functional			0
" @entity167 ( @entity121 6 ) founded in 1775 , this august company is best known for its classic blue and white hand - painted dinnerware			0
close by are @entity171 ( @entity121 4 ) , renowned for silver cutlery and jewelry , and @entity174 ( @entity121 10 ) , a department store devoted to @entity13 - designed home items			0
@entity0 ( @entity177 70 ) this cinema - turned - interiors - emporium in the affluent @entity180 neighborhood is youthful and light -- anyone fancy a bright blue bowl in bendable rubber ? 6			1
@entity0 is extra-green the @entity13 capital has electric buses , recycling - crazy citizens , clean harbors and shops selling clothes made from organic bamboo			1
a full 64 % of the city 's hotel rooms are certified as eco-friendly			0
three - quarters of the food served in public institutions is organic			0
next year , @entity0 will be the 2014 @entity197 , an award that recognizes cities with consistently high environmental standards			1
this is only the beginning : by 2025 , @entity0 plans to be the world 's first carbon - neutral capital			1
@entity204 will suck you in opened in 1843 , @entity204 is the world 's second - oldest amusement park and a much - loved attraction in this family - friendly city			0
set inside mature gardens with a lake and playgrounds , it 's a schmaltzy but happy place with roller coaster rides , pantomime shows , treat stalls , amusement arcades and more than 40 places to eat and drink			0
@entity204 is open in summer from april 10 until september 21 , then again for @entity220 ( october 11 - 27 ) and @entity8 ( november 15 - december 31 ) , when it sparkles with 2 million fairy lights			1
children under 8 get in free ; for those over 8 , it 's @entity224 ( $ 16 ) a head			0
the @entity13 are clever clogs the @entity13 invented lots of things we did n't know needed inventing			0
like the pedal bin , created by @entity232 in 1939 for his wife 's hairdressing salon			0
you can pick one up at the family 's @entity237 flagship store ( @entity236 34 ) -- your trash will thank you			2
they also largely invented existentialist angst -- the flip side of all that happiness			2
professionally gloomy philosopher @entity38 was born here in 1813 and the city is busy celebrating with a host of bicentennial exhibitions and events			0
finally , of course , @entity249			0
a marvelous @entity13 idea -- until you step on one with your bare feet			2
@entity13 does n't have the euro it 's a surprise to many , but @entity13 is n't on the euro , but the krone ( crown )			0
bank notes bear more pictures of bridges and historic finds than famous people -- typical of a nation that values construction and craftsmanship over ego			2
restaurant bills normally include a service charge and taxi drivers do n't expect a tip , although it 's customary to round up the amount			0
@entity8 and @entity274 's is a great time to go the holidays are when @entity0 is in full festive mood -- and of course it 's all done very tastefully			1
the @entity13 prefer white lights on their @entity8 trees , rather than gaudy colors , and the @entity8 markets , which start in mid-november , are n't as tacky or commercial as elsewhere			1
alongside the expected designer candle holders and licorice candies ( a national obsession ) , you 'll find stalls selling wholesome gifts such as @entity289 jewelry , high - tech kitchen utensils and sensible wooden toys			0
a white @entity8 is n't guaranteed , but snow , ice and sub-zero temperatures are a winter staple			1
good boots , a warm hat , " gløgg " ( mulled wine ) and " julebryg " ( specially brewed @entity302 ) -- these are the seasonal staples .			2

@entity0 is the capital of what is officially the happiest country on @entity4
no wonder its citizens love " hygge " -- coziness with earflaps
even the @entity8 decorations are tasteful
