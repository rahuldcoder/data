-- it is the case that seems to have no end			0
@entity4 student @entity3 and her former @entity6 boyfriend @entity5 are waiting -- once again -- for a verdict from an @entity6 court			1
@entity9 has been back home in @entity11 ever since an appeal court acquitted her and @entity5 in 2011 of the 2007 murder of @entity16 student @entity14			1
the 21 - year old was found partially naked in a pool of blood in the house she shared with @entity9 in the picturesque town of @entity23 , where both women were exchange students			1
@entity9 says she is afraid to return to @entity6 , where she spent four years behind bars			1
" i will become ... a fugitive , " she told @entity6 daily @entity28 this month , when asked what she would do if she was found guilty			1
@entity6 's @entity31 in march overturned the pair 's acquittals , saying that the jury did not consider all the evidence and that discrepancies in testimony needed to be answered			1
the case was sent to a retrial in @entity40 , where a verdict is expected thursday			1
@entity5 made it to the tribunal			0
dressed in a purple jumper , sunglasses nestled on his collar , he waited for the start of a session that was going to be beamed around the world			0
ruling unclear the retrial began last september , refocusing international attention on the case that grabbed headlines in @entity6 , @entity16 and the @entity4 -- but neither @entity9 or @entity5 were present in court			1
prosecutor @entity55 has said both @entity9 and @entity5 should be convicted and handed a 26 - year sentence for homicide , with an additional four years for @entity9 for slander			1
both have maintained their innocence			0
with little change in the case details over the years , it is not clear how presiding judge @entity64 will rule			2
regardless of the decision ... both sides will have the opportunity to appeal that verdict to @entity6 's @entity31			1
that process could take months			0
if @entity9 is ultimately found guilty , @entity6 could request her extradition from the @entity4 ' fugitive ' @entity9 , 26 , and @entity5 , 29 , were convicted in 2009 of killing @entity73 , who was found with more than 40 stab wounds and a deep gash in her throat			1
@entity9 has always denied murdering @entity73 and again maintained her innocence in a written statement to the @entity40 court			1
" i must repeat to you			0
i did not rape , i did not steal ... i did not kill @entity14 , " @entity9 said a lengthy e-mail , which was presented by her lawyer			1
@entity5 was in the @entity84 at the start of the retrial but returned to @entity6			1
in november he took to the stand to make a spontaneous declaration , saying the charges against him were " absurd			0
" " for me , it 's a nightmare that goes beyond imagination , " he said of what he 's been through			2
' no one remembers @entity14 ' a lawyer for the @entity73 family said the victim 's brother and sister , @entity99 and @entity100 , would attend court to hear the decision			1
the @entity73 family welcomed the retrial ruling , their lawyer , @entity103 said in march , adding they believed the ruling that acquitted @entity9 and @entity5 was " superficial and unbalanced			1
" the @entity73 family believes more than one person was in the room when @entity73 was killed , he said			0
" no one remembers @entity14 , while the two defendants write books , speak to the media and earn money , " @entity103 told the court in closing remarks last month			1
@entity119 advocates for @entity9 one person who has been advocating for @entity9 is @entity119 -- the @entity120 man who walked free last november after being imprisoned for nearly a decade for murdering a newspaper editor			2
a state appeals court overturned his conviction			2
" we kind of had this connection in the sense that we 've been through this justice system ... it 's relatively the same			2
we 've been through this , and there 's not a whole lot of people " who 've had the same experience , he told @entity0 's " @entity136			2
" " so it 's cool and we can kind of just talk to each other			2
she wanted to reach out and say if you need to talk to anybody , if you need any help , i 'm here for you			0
if not , i completely understand			0
so that 's how we began communicating			2
" asked about @entity9 ' current state of mind , he said she 's staying positive			1
" she seems to be doing very well			0
i 'm impressed with her			0
it 's so daunting at this time , " he said			2
" within 48 hours she should know her fate			0
you ca n't start living life until they actually clear you and until you 're free essentially			0
so i 'm amazed how she 's doing			0
she 's working hard on school and continuing life the best she can			0
she believes the courts are going to do the right thing based on the facts			0
