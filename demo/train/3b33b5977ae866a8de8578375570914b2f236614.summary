the @entity1 -- @entity2 , @entity3 , @entity4 this burger did not come from @entity2 ' so ketchup is ok			1
there are competing claims for the coveted " @entity1 " title , but according to @entity2 ( and the @entity11 , for that matter ) , this small @entity3 restaurant takes the prize			1
the story goes something like this : one day in 1900 , a rushed businessman asked owner @entity2 for something quick that he could eat on the run			1
@entity21 cooked up a beef patty , put it between some bread , and sent the man on his way			1
pretty modest beginnings for arguably the most popular sandwich of all - time , huh ? if you visit @entity2 ' today , you 'll find that not much has changed			1
the @entity21 family still owns and operates the restaurant , the burgers are still cooked in ancient gas stoves , and , just like then , there is absolutely no ketchup allowed			1
the @entity35 -- the @entity36 , @entity37 , @entity38 sometimes what counts is n't being the inventor , it 's being the innovator			1
take the fried twinkie , for example			1
the twinkie -- in all its indestructible glory -- has been around for ages , but when @entity36 owner @entity49 had the brilliant idea to freeze the snack , dip it in batter , and deep - fry it , the @entity44 took gluttony to new heights			1
even the @entity56 raved about how " something magical " happens when you taste the deep - fried twinkie 's " luscious vanilla flavor			2
" sell , who was trained in classical @entity63 cuisine , did n't start with the twinkie , though			2
in his native @entity66 , he fried up everything from @entity68 's to @entity70 bars			2
@entity71 -- @entity72 , @entity73 , @entity74 if you thought what happened up on @entity73 only happened in song , you 're sorely mistaken			2
in august of 1893 , a failed gold - miner - turned - soda - company - owner named @entity79 was drinking a bottle of his @entity72 root beer while looking up at @entity82			2
just then , a full moon illuminated the snowcap on the otherwise black mountain , and @entity79 had a brilliant idea -- float a scoop of vanilla ice cream in a glass of his root beer			2
the new drink was christened the " black cow " and became an instant classic			2
today , of course , most of us call it a root beer float			2
corn dogs -- @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 in 1946 , @entity103 , @entity104 , revolutionized the stick - meat world when he debuted the @entity100 -- the first corn dog on a stick			2
at first , he wanted to call his creation the " @entity109 , " but his wife convinced him to change the name to " @entity100			1
" she felt people would n't want to eat something described as " crusty			2
" good call , mrs. @entity115			0
shortly after the @entity100 's inception , the @entity100 opened alongside old @entity117 and has been serving up corn dogs ever since			0
the pizzeria -- @entity120 's , @entity38 , @entity38 pizza has existed in one form or another for a long time , but @entity123 got her first true pizzeria when @entity125 opened up a small grocery store in @entity38 's @entity127			1
an employee named @entity129 started selling pizzas out of the back , and in no time , @entity120 's was concentrating on its burgeoning pizza business instead of plain old groceries			0
in 1905 , the establishment was licensed as a pizzeria , and it 's stayed that way ever since			0
the original restaurant closed in 1984 but reopened down the street 10 years later			0
on its 100th anniversary in 2005 , @entity120 's decided to offer its pizza for the same price it 'd been sold for in 1905 -- 5 cents a pie			0
needless to say , the line wrapped around the block			0
@entity148 -- @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 you may not know what the @entity148 is , but when you hear what it contains , you 'll understand why it 's truly a work of inspired genius			1
since 1979 , @entity159 has played host to a collection of mobile food vans collectively known as the " @entity148			1
" originally , they served a sandwich called the @entity165 , which contained two cheeseburger patties , @entity63 fries , lettuce , tomato , and onions			0
then one night in 1997 , a hungry ( and broke ) student named @entity172 convinced one of the vendors to put chicken fingers , mozzarella sticks , @entity63 fries , and marinara sauce on a sandwich			0
strangely , the concoction sounded so appetizing that the next 10 people in line ordered it , and the @entity148 became a mainstay at the @entity148			1
hey , not any old sandwich gets to be named @entity186 's top " @entity187 " sandwich			0
@entity188 -- @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 @entity190 is known for many things ( @entity193 , the @entity194 , and @entity195 , for starters ) , but fine dining is not really its forte			0
that 's ok , though , because @entity188 is the home of @entity189 , and @entity189 is where the @entity188 cheesesteak was born			0
one day back in 1932 , hot dog stand owners @entity203 ( @entity204 ) and @entity205 decided to change things up and make a steak sandwich with onions			0
a cab driver who ate at @entity204 's daily insisted on trying the new sandwich , and with the first bite declared , " hey , forget ' bout those hot dogs , you should sell these ! " cab drivers know fast food about as well as anyone , so the brothers did just what the cabbie suggested			0
in no time , the modest stand turned into the @entity189 that exists today			0
controversy remains , however , over who 's responsible for putting the cheese in cheesesteak			0
@entity204 's claims it was the first to do so ( in 1951 ) , but across - the - street rival @entity228 of @entity228 ( opened 1966 ) insists he added the finishing touches			1
@entity231 -- @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 according to most sources , the onion ring was invented when a careless cook at a @entity232 location in @entity233 accidentally dropped an onion slice in some batter , then pulled it out and tossed it in the fryer for lack of a better destination			1
now , you 'd think inventing the onion ring would be enough for one restaurant chain , but not @entity232			1
the company also lays claim to opening @entity123 's first drive - in , inventing @entity234 toast , and being one of the first restaurants to advertise using neon signs			1
not bad for a little outfit from @entity234			1
@entity255 -- @entity256 , @entity257 , @entity258 a @entity258 favorite , derby pie is a chocolate and pecan tart with a pastry - dough crust -- and that 's about all we know about it			0
why ? because the recipe is jealously guarded by the @entity269 family			0
@entity270 manager @entity269 created derby pie in the mid- 1950s with help from his parents , @entity274 and @entity275 , and the dessert was such a hit that the family was soon baking the treat full - time			1
in fact , mrs. @entity282 , being the crafty monopolist she was , copyrighted the name , and to this day , you can only get real " @entity255 " through @entity286 not only that , but a man from @entity66 once handed @entity275 a blank check for the recipe so that his daughter could make the pie at home			0
