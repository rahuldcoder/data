to those of us who have studied the largest wave of immigration in history from a single country to the @entity6 -- the four - decade - long influx of millions of @entity8 -- it seemed inconceivable that it would ever come to a halt			1
yet , as our new @entity12 report has shown , it has			0
our analysis of @entity8 and @entity6 data sources indicates that at least as many @entity8 and their families are leaving the @entity6 as are arriving in the @entity6 from @entity8			1
as a result , the @entity8 - born population in the @entity6 decreased from 12.6 million in 2007 to 12 million in 2011			1
this appears to be the first sustained decline in the number of @entity8 immigrants since the @entity22 , and it is entirely because of a reduction in illegal immigration -- more going home and fewer coming			1
today , we estimate that 51 % of all @entity8 immigrants living in the @entity6 are unauthorized			1
in 2007 , that figure was 56 %			0
even with the recent decline , @entity8 are still by far the largest single immigrant group in the @entity6 , accounting for 30 % of the foreign - born			1
the population of @entity8 immigrants in the @entity6 is larger than that of most countries or states : 10 % of @entity8 - born people worldwide live in the @entity6			1
no other nation in the world has as many of its people living abroad as does @entity8			0
what caused the big immigration wave to stop ? we think that many factors were at work , on both sides of the border			0
we can not say how much of a role each of them played in tamping down migration to the @entity6 and setting up the large reverse flows , but they all seem to have had an impact			0
the sharp decline began about five years ago , around the time the @entity6 housing market collapsed			2
many construction jobs held by @entity8 immigrants vanished			1
the continued weakness in the overall @entity6 economy made it harder to find other jobs as well			2
although the @entity63 has officially ended , the job market is not back to what it was			0
during these same years , @entity6 officials have heightened enforcement of immigration laws along the border and elsewhere			2
unauthorized border - crossers have faced harsher penalties , and deportations have risen			1
we estimate that anywhere from 5 % to 35 % of the @entity8 who went home over the past five years did so involuntarily			0
six states , including @entity78 , have passed laws intended to reduce unauthorized immigration			0
for these and other reasons , it has become more dangerous to try to cross the border from @entity8			1
developments on the @entity8 side of the border also could be affecting migration flows			2
@entity8 's economy , like that in the @entity6 , fell into a deep recession from 2007 to 2009			1
but in 2010 and 2011 , the @entity92 there grew at higher rates than the @entity6 gdp , so @entity8 enjoyed a somewhat stronger recovery that may have encouraged some to stay home and others to return			1
another change in @entity8 that is just beginning to affect migration streams is a steep decline in birth rates			1
in 1960 , the fertility rate in @entity8 was 7.3 -- meaning , on average , a @entity8 woman could expect to have seven children in her lifetime			0
in 2009 , it had dropped to 2.4			0
declining birth rates have pushed up the median age of the @entity8 population			2
this has meant that the age group in the prime years for emigration , 15 - to 39 - year - olds , is a shrinking share of @entity8 's population			0
will the net standstill in migration from @entity8 continue ? we do not know , in part because of uncertainties about economic trends in both nations and future trends in enforcement policies			0
the decline in @entity8 birth rates , however , does appear to be a long - term change that will limit the size of the pool of young people who are the most likely to emigrate			1
but even if @entity8 immigration does begin to rise again , consider how far it has fallen			0
from 1995 through 2000 , we estimate that 3 million @entity8 moved to the @entity6 , and nearly 700,000 , including family members born in the @entity6 , went home			2
from 2005 through 2010 , we estimate that about 1.4 million @entity8 arrived , and the same number , including @entity6 - born children , left			2
considering everything , a return to the migration levels of the late 1990s now seems inconceivable .			0

*researchers* : as many @entity8 are leaving the @entity6 as they are arriving from @entity8
this is first sustained decline in @entity8 immigrants since the @entity22 , they say
writers : reasons might be jobs are now fewer in @entity6 and @entity8 birth rate is declining
writers : harsher penalities for border crossers , more deportations may be at play
