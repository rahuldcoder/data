-- imagine you are sitting in your office simply doing your job and a nasty e-mail pops into your inbox accusing you of being a fraud			2
you go online and find that some bloggers have written virulent posts about you			0
that night , you 're at home with your family watching the news and a talking head is lambasting you by name			0
later , a powerful politician demands all your e-mails from your former employer			0
but it all happened to me			0
what was my offense ? i worked on climate change research that indicated the world is a lot warmer today than it was in the past			1
because that research caught the public 's attention when it was released in 1998 , i became one of dozens of climate researchers who have been systematically targeted by a well - funded anti-science campaign			1
ironically , as these attacks have grown , the scientific facts have become ever clearer			0
climate scientists know the world is warming and human activity -- particularly burning coal and oil -- is the primary driver			1
the idea of addressing climate change threatens some people in the fossil fuel industry			1
and a vocal minority of corporate interests and their ideological allies are spending a lot of money to hijack the public debate about climate change			1
i call all this the " scientization " of politics			2
attacks on science and scientists are an effort to advance a political agenda , not an effort to better understand science or the risks it uncovers			2
the tobacco industry did it when scientists linked cigarettes to cancer			1
the lead industry tried to discredit a scientist who found that lead exposure hurt children 's cognitive abilities			1
now , it 's climate scientists ' turn			1
in the most infamous episode , somebody stole thousands of e-mails and documents from leading climate researchers , including me			2
they cherry picked key phrases from the e-mails and published them out of context , like a black - and - white political attack ad with ominous music			2
fossil fuel industry - funded groups gleefully spread the e-mails online and badgered the mainstream media into covering the " controversy " they had manufactured			1
it was no accident that this happened on the eve of a major international climate change meeting			1
@entity94 , the world 's largest exporter of oil , was the first to call for an investigation			0
the dozen independent investigations that did follow -- all of which exonerated the scientists -- got much less media coverage than the original nonscandal			2
last year , the inspector general of the @entity106 found the charges against me were all baseless and reaffirmed mainstream climate science			2
larger political factors helped sink the climate change talks			1
but the stolen e-mail " scandal " has lived on			0
@entity115 attorney general @entity114 ( also a candidate for governor ) cited it in his demand from my former employer -- the @entity122 -- for all my documents and e-mails dating back several years			0
on march 2 , the @entity125 ruled in our favor -- a pyrrhic victory considering all of the money and resources wasted that could have been invested , for example , in measures to protect @entity115 's coastline from the damaging effects of the sea level rise it is already seeing			0
these attacks have prompted me to tell my own story in a new book , " @entity139 : dispatches from the @entity141			0
" before it even came out , a coal industry front group ran radio advertisements condemning my employer , @entity144 , for allowing me to speak on my own campus			0
later , a former tobacco industry apologist offered $ 500 to anyone who would ask me a challenging question at another talk and provide him with video			0
this is a silly -- and indeed , dangerous -- way to have a climate change debate in this country			1
what keeps climate scientists working away in our labs and in the field , is that we keep uncovering more evidence of how climate change will impact our planet and our lives			1
in the face of these attacks , scientists are doing more to speak out , forming a @entity167 to connect scientists with journalists and a @entity170 to help scientists defray legal costs			0
groups like the @entity174 are redoubling their efforts to defend scientists and advance public understanding of climate change			1
and scientific societies are starting to do more to help their members deal with the poisonous political environment around climate change			1
i first tackled climate science as a graduate student in theoretical physics , looking around for a topic that would be worthy of a lifetime 's work			1
attacked both professionally and personally , i became a reluctant public figure in the climate wars			0
and now , as the father of a 6 - year - old girl , i want to make sure the planet we leave her is at least as beautiful and healthy as the one we grew up on			0
at the very least , our nation 's political and business leaders deserve to have a debate about her future that is grounded in reality			0
my daughter , and all of our children , deserve no less			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

climate scientist @entity206 says he was target of nasty campaign to discredit his work
@entity206 : attack against scientists was funded by fossil fuel industry , anti-science ideologists
all accusations proven false , he says , but it *galvanized* scientists to counter *misinformation*
@entity206 : poisonous politics must not hijack the *conversation* about climate change
