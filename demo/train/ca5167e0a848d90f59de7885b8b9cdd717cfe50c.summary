@entity0 -- a federal judge issued a preliminary injunction monday temporarily blocking key provisions of a new @entity6 law that aims to crack down on illegal immigration , while allowing other parts of the law to move forward			1
most of the law , known as @entity12 87 , was scheduled to go into effect friday			0
@entity16 district judge @entity15 's ruling blocks enforcement of two of the most controversial sections of the law			1
" state and local law enforcement officers and officials have no authorization to arrest , detain or prosecute anyone based upon sections 7 and 8 of @entity12 87 while this injunction remains in effect , " @entity15 ruled			1
those sections would allow police to inquire about immigration status when questioning suspects in certain criminal investigations			2
they also would punish people who , during the commission of a crime , knowingly transport or harbor illegal immigrants			0
something like speeding or driving without proper equipment could constitute a crime			0
" the apparent legislative intent is to create such a climate of hostility , fear , mistrust and insecurity that all illegal aliens will leave @entity6 , " @entity15 wrote			2
in his 45 - page ruling , the judge cited a previous court decision that said preliminary injunctions were in the public interest " when civil rights are at stake			2
" he also wrote that state officials were attempting to overstep federal authority on immigration enforcement			1
" i 'm very happy , as are all those who believe the @entity63 is important , " said @entity58 , an @entity0 attorney whose firm represented some of the plaintiffs			0
he said the stayed provisions were poorly written and that it was unclear how they would have been enforced , if allowed to move forward			1
although the ruling was hailed as a victory by the plaintiffs , @entity15 also tossed out a number of their arguments at the state 's request , a point stressed by @entity6 attorney general @entity75 soon after the decision			1
" i appreciate the speed with which judge @entity15 ruled , given the complexity of the issues			0
i am pleased with the dismissal of the 4th amendment , @entity82 , ' right to @entity83 , ' and @entity6 constitutional claims by the plaintiffs -- even after this ruling , 21 of the 23 sections of @entity12 will go into effect as planned , " @entity75 wrote in a statement			1
a part of the law that will still go into effect is a provision that workers convicted of using fake identification to get jobs could be sentenced to 15 years in prison and fined $ 250,000			2
the law will also require people applying for public benefits to provide certain types of identification			0
@entity75 said his office will appeal the judge 's ruling regarding sections 7 and 8			2
the office of @entity6 gov. @entity107 , which supports the law , also weighed in on the judge 's ruling			1
" beyond refusing to help with our state 's illegal immigration problem , the federal government is determined to be an obstacle			2
the state of @entity6 narrowly tailored its immigration law to conform with existing federal law and court rulings , " said @entity116 , the governor 's deputy chief of staff for communications			1
" @entity123 can rest assured that this battle does n't end here			0
" the @entity6 lawsuit is the latest battle in a nationwide skirmish between state and federal officials over who controls immigration enforcement			1
@entity135 's controversial law aimed at cracking down on illegal immigration catapulted the issue onto the national stage last year , drawing a lawsuit from the @entity16 @entity140 , which argues the law is unconstitutional			0
in april , a three - judge panel on the 9th @entity143 sided with the @entity140 and against @entity135 gov. @entity144 , who signed @entity135 's law last year			0
@entity144 announced last month that the state would appeal directly to the @entity16 @entity147			0
@entity1 's @entity148 and @entity149 contributed to this report .			0

the state law is part of the broader nationwide immigration debate
@entity6 officials say they will appeal the ruling
the judge says law enforcement officers can not enforce two sections of the law
most provisions of the law will be allowed to move forward
