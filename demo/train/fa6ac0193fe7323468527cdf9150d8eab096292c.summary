@entity0 -- @entity2 had every reason to be pleased with his success			1
a gift for drawing led to a prestigious career as a propaganda artist and full membership in @entity11 's communist party			1
then the food shortages started			0
like tens of thousands of other @entity11 in the mid- 1990s , @entity2 made forays across the @entity14 to find food in @entity16			1
despite witnessing a better material life across the border , he says , he never doubted that @entity11 was culturally superior			1
he never considered leaving his homeland for anything more than food			2
" i was a believer			0
i saw @entity11 as pure , " @entity2 said			1
" and we needed the great leader to protect us from outsiders			2
" today , @entity2 paints in @entity26 , @entity27 , his art haunted by his former whole - hearted belief in the @entity11 regime			1
@entity2 's paintings chronicle a personal , often agonizing journey from child - like allegiance to the country 's founder and " @entity31 , " @entity31 , and his son , " @entity32 " @entity32 , to @entity2 's life today as a contemporary artist			1
in his former life , he would paint boyish - looking soldiers with heroic features across an entire side of a factory to inspire workers with the same patriotism he believed in			2
his current paintings explore themes of freedom while skewering his former devotion to @entity11 's leaders			1
he paints children in military uniforms , their heads bowed and eyes closed			0
his trademark work shows @entity32 's face atop @entity61 's famous film pose on a sidewalk grate , holding down her skirt as it billows around her hips			0
the painting created a stir in @entity27 , where @entity68 @entity67 saw it and raised funds on @entity71 to exhibit @entity2 's work this winter in @entity73 and @entity0			1
song is passionate and sometimes brooding when discussing @entity11 but gracious and open about his deeply personal passage from propaganda artist to painter who anguishes over oppression in @entity11			1
@entity79 : @entity11 will achieve nothing with provocation song 's journey to disbelief began the moment he watched , helpless , as his father was caught in a current during a river crossing to @entity16 and drowned			1
@entity2 was halfway across when his father was swept away ; he swam back but was unable to rescue him			1
@entity87 , @entity2 searched for his father 's body along the riverbank but was captured by @entity11 border guards			1
despite his rank as a party member , getting caught meant questioning and torture by @entity11 guards to confirm that he was not working for the @entity27 or the foreign missionaries based in @entity16 who proselytize among defectors			1
" there were no exceptions , " he said			0
" all who are caught are investigated			0
" in @entity11 , a brutal choice the torment of not recovering his father 's remains was much greater than the broken teeth and beatings , @entity2 said			1
the beatings were so harsh , he said , he was close to death , and he believes that he was released so he would not die in custody			0
more than bones , the guards ' treatment broke @entity2 's belief in the regime			1
he describes the moment he left jail as if a veil had been lifted : he saw the world with a new clarity			0
as he hobbled through the streets , wondering how he 'd get home , he decided he wanted a different life			0
in a country of 25 million , only about 20,000 have defected and settled in @entity27 , according to the @entity27 government			1
there are no precise figures for how many defectors live in hiding in @entity16 ; estimates from governments , researchers and non-governmental organizations vary from 25,000 to more than 400,000			1
" when people are picked up in @entity16 and repatriated , they face prosecution back in @entity11 if they are believed to have met with @entity27 or missionaries , " said @entity132 , a @entity11 specialist at the @entity133			1
@entity16 labels @entity11 escapees " economic migrants " and forcibly returns them despite accounts of torture and execution			2
so those hoping to defect must make their way across @entity16 to a third country			0
of those @entity11 interviewed in @entity16 , only about one in 10 say they left because of a longing for freedom , according to @entity150 , a public health expert at @entity152 who has studied the issue for more than a decade			2
the vast majority who leave give the same explanation song did for his pre-defector forays into @entity16 during the famine : the search for work or food			0
" the ( @entity11 ) system is so integral to who you are , " @entity150 said			2
" people generally do n't say ' i am frustrated , and i want out			0
' " @entity2 's paintings explore that theme : a devotion to serving @entity11 's leaders so strong that citizens view it as part of their identity			1
" @entity176 " shows a gaggle of smiling , uniformed schoolgirls waving and holding @entity11 's standard reading primers , " @entity179 of @entity32 's childhood " and " history of @entity31			2
" the girls exude childish charm , but some faces show a weariness that only comes with age , and their eyes are all closed			0
" they believe they are happy , " @entity2 said			2
" they believe they are so much better off than the rest of the world because of their two leaders , who are like two suns			0
" @entity2 can still recite some of the pages from those reading primers , and he remembers walking to school in similar shoes			2
such memories inspire him to paint , he says , and he hopes people find his interpretations of those memories compelling			0
" @entity14 " is done in classical @entity16 style			0
at first glance , with its brushed mountain landscape , the painting looks like it could be from the @entity211			0
on closer inspection , its subtleties portray @entity11 's crippling poverty			2
peasants work fields with oxen while nearby , a broken - down tractor rusts			0
soldiers fish for their dinner downstream from women doing laundry by hand			0
in the hills above the river are billboards common throughout @entity11 , with phrases such as " all glory to our nation 's @entity229 " and " all glory to our nation 's @entity233			2
" near the billboards , peasants dig for edible roots , which are commonly steamed in a kettle before being eaten			0
" the past and the present of @entity11 are the same , " @entity2 said			1
" there is no progress			0
" despite the large and absolute devotion of most @entity11 to their government , @entity2 is optimistic about their future under @entity246 , who recently inherited the country 's reins after his father , the @entity32 , died			1
in a nation where every decision flows from the top , a change of leadership can transform everything			0
" @entity246 will want to try something new , " @entity2 said			1
" you can not change the nature of youth			0
" if @entity246 allowed the population access to television , websites and radio from @entity26 , with its opulent lifestyle , change would be inevitable , and the emotional connection to the government would gradually wither , @entity2 believes			1
meanwhile , being caught with foreign media can mean public execution or three generations of your family being sent to prison camp			0
so few people outside the party elite dare to smuggle radios or dvds from @entity16			0
but if those punishments were ever removed , @entity2 says , @entity11 would probably lose their devotion to the regime as quickly as their @entity282 neighbors stopped worshiping their emperor after @entity284 it would take only a clear view of the poverty and oppression in their life to spark cataclysmic demands for change , @entity2 says			1
the spectacular failure of its command economy has made @entity11 one of the poorest nations on @entity298			2
by one plausible account , teenage defectors of the past decade are 5 inches shorter and 25 pounds lighter than their @entity27 counterparts			1
" i feel a great deal of anger now that i understand the problems " in @entity11 society , he says			2
" i never felt it when i was there			0

once a propagandist , defector @entity2 now paints *satirical* works about @entity11
his paintings dwell on *miseries* of life in his homeland , *joy* of the freedoms he found in the @entity27
from a country of 25 million , only about 20,000 @entity11 defectors live in the @entity27
song is optimistic new leader @entity246 will be an agent for change
