-- it should have been the proudest moment in his life -- instead @entity4 finds himself embroiled in controversy and his career in doubt after scoring the goal that helped his club win this year 's @entity10			1
the 28 - year - old 's first reaction -- prior to being wrestled to the floor by his @entity15 teammates in celebration -- was to hold out four fingers in a gesture that has become synonymous with ousted @entity20 president @entity19			1
known as ' @entity22 ' , which means four , the salute is considered the symbol of defiance against military rule and refers to the @entity27 mosque where supporters of @entity19 's @entity29 clashed with the army in august , resulting in hundreds of deaths			0
even though @entity4 claims his actions had no political meaning , the tense political situation in @entity20 was highlighted by the strength of the sanctions meted out to him by @entity15 's board on tuesday			1
the forward has not only been put up for sale but also barred from competing in next month 's @entity41 -- a tournament that carries special significance in @entity44 since it affords teams a rare chance to play with the world watching while testing themselves against some of the planet 's best players			1
in a statement that explained the club 's " firm rejection of mixing politics and sport " , @entity15 also revealed that @entity4 will also miss out on any financial bonus gained from the club 's continental triumph			1
supporters of the stringent sanctions will argue that @entity4 's actions could have had serious repercussions as @entity64 hosted a major football match with fans in attendance for one of the few times since last year 's stadium disaster in @entity70			0
the rampage in february 2012 left 74 people dead and 1,000 injured after the @entity70 home team , @entity73 , defeated a visiting @entity15 side			2
a majority of the victims in the stadium rampage were @entity15 fans , with many believing they had been targeted after their role in the revolution had helped topple longstanding president @entity81 in 2011			2
" i did do the sign but did not intend any political incitement for any group or any fan , " @entity4 said in a statement			0
" i meant it in mourning for the @entity20 who died in @entity22 ( @entity88 ) , including citizens , soldiers and policemen			0
" @entity4 's comments come despite his status as one of the few football stars who participated in the @entity29 's sit - in at @entity97			0
@entity4 is not the first @entity20 sportsman to suffer because of his association with the gesture			1
last month , an @entity20 kung fu champion who wore a t - shirt with the @entity22 sign was barred from representing his country and stripped of a medal he had won at a tournament in @entity107			2
@entity4 's agent said the controversial celebration had its roots in personal tragedy that stemmed from the august actions , when security forces stormed the @entity115 camp a month after the military had ousted the @entity118 leader			0
" what he meant by the sign is that he was mourning one of his friends who died during the events surrounding the clearing of @entity125 in august , " said @entity119			0
" @entity4 wrote an apology to the @entity15 's board of directors and the @entity20 public for showing the @entity22 sign during the match between @entity15 and @entity130			1
" @entity4 's goal in @entity64 , which clinched an aggregate 3 - 1 victory over the @entity134 side as @entity15 landed a record eighth continental crown , sealed their place in the @entity41			1
@entity44 will stage the tournament for the first time when @entity139 hosts an event that begins on 11 december , with @entity15 playing @entity142 champions @entity141 three days later			2
@entity10 winners @entity144 and @entity147 's @entity146 holders @entity143 , who boast @entity149 in their number , are among those contesting the seven - team event .			0
