-- one day before the unofficial " @entity11 " holiday in may , an @entity2 replica wheeled through the front door of the @entity5 home in @entity6 , @entity7 , to the delight of the three young " @entity11 " fans in the house			1
" may the fourth be with you ! " exclaimed 5 - year - old @entity13 , decked out in full @entity15 gear			0
in a house filled with excited shouts , it was n't apparent that a very important person was missing from the packed dinner table			1
but @entity2 had a special surprise			2
the robot projected a video of deployed @entity26 pilot @entity25 , father to @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity13			1
his sons were shocked into momentary silence as they watched			2
in the video , @entity25 told his family that he loved them and implored his boys to congratulate their mother on her graduation from a master 's program at the @entity38			2
welcome to " dinner with the @entity40			1
" @entity41 is a @entity26 wife , syndicated columnist and author			1
she has already made it through two of her husband 's deployments , first in 2001 and again in 2003			1
his current 13 - month stint overseas , which began in november , is his longest yet			2
she used to mark his absence by the number of times that she had to take out the trash			0
" but that ends up not being a good way to count , because i take out the trash when he 's home , too , " she smiled			2
her sons @entity27 , @entity28 , and @entity13 are now ages 11 , 9 , and 5 , respectively , and she wanted to mark their dad 's absence with something special that would fill up their time while he was overseas			1
dinner can be a lonely time when he is away , she said			2
before @entity25 left , the children told their mom that they would be sad to see their dad 's empty chair at the dinner table			1
she told them that they could fill his seat with family and friends			2
" it just kind of grew from there , " she said			0
so , now the @entity40 each take a turn inviting a special guest to dinner every week for 52 weeks until dad returns			1
sen. @entity79 , a @entity7 @entity80 , was the first official guest in january , and she talked to the deployed dad by video chat			1
it was 11 - year - old son @entity27 's idea to send the invitation to @entity85			0
now it 's off to the races : " my kids got it in their head that they could invite anybody they wanted , if a senator came , " @entity41 said			1
news of the @entity40 ' project spread all the way to @entity96 through her column and her @entity99 page			1
" the @entity100 contacted us and said that they loved this project and they 'd love to be a part of it , " she said			0
" so my son sent a letter to the president and the vice president and invited them to dinner			0
" the standing rule is one special guest per dinner ( the invited guest gets a " plus one " ) , but when it comes to the highest office in the land , the kids will make a few concessions			1
" my son said in the letter , ' usually we invite one guest and tell them they can bring a guest , but we 'll make an exception if you would like to bring your wives and your children , " @entity41 said			1
@entity131 even responded to the invitation with a thank you note			0
@entity41 wo n't reveal the identities of future guests to the public , but she drops hints on their @entity99 page			1
" as much as i want to tell people who 's coming next , i know it 's been a fun thing for people in the community to guess so i have to keep my mouth shut , " she said			0
@entity41 did indicate that they have some exciting guests who are " involved with professional sports " lined up this summer			1
" it 's just killing [ @entity25 ] that he 's not here for those dinners , " she said			0
she plans to invite all of their guests back to a big celebration once he 's had a chance to settle back in after his return in december			1
often , the family has lower - profile but just as meaningful guests over			0
when 5 - year - old @entity13 's turn came to pick whom to invite , he selected his preschool teacher			2
his teacher initially hesitated , unsure about living up to the star power of other visitors , but @entity41 insisted that she would make a wonderful guest			2
" to my son , having his preschool teacher was pretty much like having @entity167 or the president			0
he thought that was just amazing , " she said			0
they 've also met with neighbors , the town 's police chief , members of the @entity38 hockey team and a cancer survivor			1
all of the visits are photographed by @entity178 and chronicled on the " dinner with the @entity40 " @entity99 page			1
@entity41 is always asked how she can possibly arrange a dinner party every week			1
" i 'm not a cook ... i 'm serving people lasagna , spaghetti			0
there are a couple of times that we 've gone out to restaurants			0
so there 's nothing fancy at all and my house is never clean , " she said			0
" it 's truly real life , exactly as we would be eating dinner if we did n't have someone there			2
" she said that people worry too much about presenting a perfect home and miss out on important opportunities to share memories with friends and family			0
" i 've never apologized to our guests , " she said , but then backtracked			0
" we had our minister to dinner			0
the kids truly had a knock - down , drag - out wrestling match on the living room floor			0
i did apologize that night			0
" the entire family feels her husband 's absence			2
" i think it 's hardest on my oldest son because he 's right at the preteen years , " said @entity41			1
" my middle son just got on the little league team			0
so there 's a lot of ways that for the older boys they really need their dad right now			0
" she said that the boys ' emotions about their dad come out in different , and subtle , ways : " you look back in hindsight and you say , ' that was n't like him , and i wonder if it 's because his dad is gone			0
' " @entity41 and @entity25 met when their fathers flew together in the same @entity26 squadron			1
she was born while her father was deployed , so she said that she actually met her husband , while they were babies , before she met her father			2
despite all of the unique guests and experiences the @entity40 have had , the guest that the family looks forward to most is the one they 'll have at their table on the 53rd week			1
that 's when @entity25 comes home .			0

@entity41 is a writer and mom whose @entity26 husband is deployed for 13 months
@entity41 suggested that her sons invite special guests to fill @entity252 's place at the dinner table
the @entity40 have hosted a @entity7 senator , a police chief and a cancer survivor
