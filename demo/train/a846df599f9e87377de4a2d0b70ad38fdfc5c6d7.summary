-- two days after staging the biggest club game on the planet , @entity1 hosted the richest match in world football - with @entity6 taking spoils worth $ 180 million as they gained promotion to the @entity9			1
less than 48 hours after @entity10 beat @entity11 2 - 1 to lift the @entity12 , @entity6 beat @entity13 1 - 0 after extra-time to earn promotion from the @entity16 , the division immediately below the @entity9			1
the winning goal in front of a packed crowd containing honorary @entity13 chairman @entity20 and outgoing @entity22 boss @entity21 came from @entity23 , whose professional career started at @entity13 and who had lost his three previous playoff finals			1
he was given the chance after 105 minutes from the penalty spot and despite the intense pressure of securing riches galore for his club on a sweltering day at @entity1 , a man who turns 40 in july was coolness personified as he fired high into the net			1
the kick was effectively worth $ 180 million - with half of that coming from television revenue and another $ 90m from the parachute payments that go to any team that drops out of the @entity9			1
with the team that finishes bottom of the @entity9 earning a minimum of $ 1.1m in addition to the extra revenue brought in from gate receipts , @entity6 's owners can plan for the future with real optimism even if the club is relegated after just one season in the top flight			1
the club hierarchy had craved promotion so that funds could be used to redevelop their @entity57 stadium			0
" we are in the @entity9 - so @entity60 help us , " laughed winning coach @entity58			2
" it is absolutely massive to be back in the @entity9			2
they have plans to do up the ground and i am so happy for everyone connected with the club			0
" relegation has befallen @entity6 every time they have gained promotion to the @entity9 , while only nine of the 21 playoff winners have managed to stay in the division the following season , so @entity58 is likely to have a busy summer trying to improve his squad			1
he already knows that he must do without winger @entity75 , who was the outstanding player on the pitch and whose trickery was finally rewarded when he won the penalty at the end of the first period of extra-time			0
@entity82 , the 20 - year - old who earned his first @entity85 call - up last november , agreed to join @entity85 champions @entity86 in january , so becoming the last signing of outgoing manager @entity88			0
he was bought for $ 24 million and instantly loaned back to the club whose academy he joined at the age of 10 , six years after moving to @entity94 from his native @entity95			0
" i 'm speechless - this is a dream come true , " @entity82 told @entity97 television after the game			0
" this is all i wanted , leaving @entity6 knowing they are in the @entity9			1
i just told myself to give it all i can - 100 % , 200 %			0
" i 've been at the club so long			0
all i want to do is help out the team , i 'm so glad we made it to the @entity9			0
" monday 's success caps a remarkable turnaround for @entity6			0
three years ago , fans were fearing for their favorites ' future as they protested outside a bank as a club founded in 1905 was threatened with extinction			0
docked 10 points by the @entity116 for going into administration , @entity6 not only escaped liquidation but also managed to avoid relegation to the third tier of @entity85 football on the last day of the 2009 - 2010 season			1
palace fans would have been nervous again in the last minute of extra-time as @entity13 's @entity125 curled an effort towards the far corner only for @entity128 to clear off the line			2
the club joins @entity131 and @entity132 in winning promotion to the @entity9 from the championship , with @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 heading in the opposite direction			2
@entity139 's @entity13 , who were seeking a return to the top flight for the first time in six years , ultimately paid the price for slipping up on the final day of the season , losing at home to @entity147 when victory would have earned promotion			2
the club has been criticized this season for bringing in a number of players on loan from sister clubs @entity154 ( @entity155 ) and @entity156 ( @entity157 ) , which are also owned by the @entity159 family			0
despite the last 10 competitive meetings between @entity13 and @entity6 producing 38 goals , monday 's game at @entity1 ended goalless after 90 minutes - as the massive expectation seemed to weigh upon both team 's players			1
nonetheless , all associated with @entity6 can now look forward to wednesday 19 june with great excitement as that is when the 2013 - 14 @entity9 fixtures are set to be released .			1

@entity6 beat @entity13 1 - 0 after extra-time to earn promotion to the @entity9
@entity23 scores from the penalty spot to atone for three previous playoff *failures*
@entity6 will be $ 180 million richer even if they survive just one season in the @entity9
