@entity0 -- the @entity2 began 60 years ago on june 25 , 1950 , and it still has n't ended			0
fighting on the @entity3 may have stopped with a cease - fire in july 1953 , but @entity5 and @entity6 have remained in a tense state of armed truce ever since , with open warfare just a hair - trigger away			1
the sinking of the @entity6 navy vessel @entity13 on march 26 -- which an international investigation team concluded last week to be the result of a @entity17 torpedo attack -- shows how volatile the situation remains between @entity5			1
there is a real danger of the current war of words escalating into a shooting war , which would be a catastrophe for @entity6 and the surrounding region			0
but if all sides , including the @entity27 , pull back from the brink , this tragedy may also present an opportunity to defuse tensions with @entity17 and resume talks that have been on hold for the last two years			2
the @entity13 disaster caused an outcry of grief and anger in @entity6			0
on may 24 , @entity6 's president @entity37 gave a forceful speech to his countrymen , asserting that @entity6 would not tolerate any provocation from the @entity5 and would pursue " proactive deterrence			1
" @entity6 , @entity37 vowed , " will immediately exercise our right of self - defense " if their territorial waters , airspace or territory are violated			0
" @entity37 called the sinking of the @entity13 , in which 46 sailors died , a violation of the @entity52 and of the @entity53 and said he would turn to the @entity54 for international support in condemning @entity17			1
@entity27 secretary of state @entity56 has demanded @entity17 face " consequences " for this attack			0
but @entity17 denies involvement in the incident , claiming the whole investigation is a fabrication designed to undermine @entity5 - @entity6 relations and ignite a war against the @entity5			1
the @entity17 have said any retaliation against them for the incident would be met with a forceful and immediate response , up to and including all - out war			0
@entity70 has so far been neutral about the investigation 's findings , calling the incident a " tragedy " but refusing to blame @entity17 and calling for calm on all sides			1
without @entity70 's support , no call for action against @entity17 will make it through the @entity54			1
( @entity70 is one of the five nations that hold veto power on the @entity54			1
) @entity70 supported two rounds of @entity54 sanctions against @entity85 , after @entity17 's nuclear tests in 2006 and 2009 , but is unlikely to support sanctions this time			1
@entity17 denies responsibility for the incident and @entity70 regards the evidence as inconclusive			1
besides , it 's hard to see what further economic or diplomatic pressure can be put on @entity17 , which already faces tough previous sanctions			1
contrary to common belief , @entity17 is not facing internal political disarray or economic decline			0
@entity98 appears to be fully in charge , and harvests for the last two years have been relatively good			0
@entity70 sources estimate a substantial increase in @entity17 industrial production over the last year			2
whatever may have motivated the attack on the @entity13 , it was not the act of a desperate or divided regime , and the strong sanctions called for by president @entity37 -- even if @entity70 would agree to support and enforce them -- are not likely to get @entity17 to admit responsibility for the attack or to change its behavior			1
on the other hand , there is a real danger of this war of words escalating into a shooting war			0
with well over a million @entity17 troops facing each other across the @entity122 separating @entity123 , along with 29,000 @entity27 troops in the @entity6 , and @entity17 now armed with nuclear weapons , the consequences of a renewed @entity2 would be catastrophic for the @entity3 and the entire @entity127 region			1
the @entity13 incident has reinforced @entity27 - @entity6 and @entity27 - @entity130 cooperation in deterring the @entity5			2
but deterrence can look like provocation from the other side , and in such a tense and volatile environment , a slight miscalculation can lead to disaster			0
anger and outrage may be understandable , but cooler heads must prevail			0
millions of lives are at stake			0
rather than lead to deepening confrontation , this tragedy may be an opportunity to re-engage @entity17 in talks to scale back and ultimately eliminate its nuclear program , and to promote security and economic cooperation with its neighbors			2
@entity17 has never admitted to acts of terrorism in the past , and we can not expect it to acknowledge responsibility and apologize for the sinking of the @entity13 as a precondition for such talks			2
instead , the international community should take advantage of @entity98 's stated willingness to return to multilateral negotiations , suspended since 2008 , as a way of reducing tensions on the @entity3			2
it is time to end the @entity2 , not start it anew			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0
