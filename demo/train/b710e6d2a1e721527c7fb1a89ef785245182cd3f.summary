@entity7 as the deadline imposed by @entity6 approached , the mother of one of two @entity3 men held by the militant group begged for her son 's life			1
" to all members of @entity6 , @entity12 [ @entity13 ] is not the enemy of @entity6			1
please release him , " @entity15 , @entity16 's mother , said in a statement thursday			1
" there is so little time left before the deadline			2
" @entity6 has threatened in a video released tuesday to kill two @entity3 citizens , @entity16 and @entity24 , if it does n't receive $ 200 million in ransom from the @entity3 government			1
time is of the essence : the @entity3 government says it estimates @entity6 ' ultimatum will expire at 2:50 p.m. friday , @entity7 time ( 12:50 a.m. et friday )			1
" i sincerely apologize to the @entity3 government and all concerned foreign countries for all the trouble that my son has caused , " @entity15 said			1
" i have been just crying for last three days , filled with sadness			2
words fail to describe how i feel			2
@entity12 always has been a kind person ever since he was little			2
he was always saying , ' i want to save the lives of children in war zones			2
' " @entity3 officials have said they are doing their best to communicate with @entity6 , but @entity3 chief cabinet secretary @entity42 said thursday that @entity7 had so far heard nothing and does n't know what situation the two hostages are in			1
in a thursday news conference , @entity3 chief cabinet secretary @entity42 said @entity3 wants to secure the hostages ' safe release but will not yield to the threat of the terrorists			1
he said @entity3 was trying to reach the @entity6 captors through third parties , such as governments in the region or local tribal leaders , but has not been able to determine whether @entity16 and @entity56 are safe			1
" we are aiming to save them as soon as possible , " @entity42 said thursday			0
the government of @entity60 has told @entity3 it will do as much as possible to try to secure the release of @entity16 and @entity24 , according to @entity42			1
@entity60 , one of the @entity63 nations taking part in the @entity66 - led bombing campaign against @entity6 , already has its own challenge to deal with : the militant group last month captured a @entity60 pilot whose plane crashed in @entity71			1
@entity3 officials have repeatedly stressed that their military , which is constitutionally forbidden from taking action other than for self - defense , is n't involved in the international airstrikes against @entity6 positions in @entity71 and @entity77			1
the masked militant speaking in the @entity6 video linked the group 's ransom demand to @entity3 prime minister @entity83 's recent pledge of $ 200 million in financial aid to countries affected by the militant group			1
video raises new questions about ' @entity89 ' @entity42 reiterated thursday that the funds @entity3 has offered are for humanitarian purposes , like helping refugees , not military purposes			1
leading @entity3 news organizations have reported , citing unidentified government sources , that @entity16 's wife got an e-mail in december from someone demanding $ 8 million to $ 16 million for her husband 's return			1
the government is trying to confirm if that e-mail came from @entity6 , the reports said			1
if so , it could indicate the militant group is willing to accept a smaller ransom than the $ 200 million it had publicly demanded			1
but the question is what , if anything , is @entity3 willing to give			1
@entity6 has a ruthless track record			1
it has released videos touting the killing of five @entity115 hostages since august			2
@entity83 has called @entity6 ' ultimatum over the two @entity3 men 's lives " unacceptable " and said the international community should n't give in to terrorists			1
but he and other government officials have n't explicitly ruled out paying a ransom			2
should nations just pay @entity6 ransom ? some details have emerged about what spurred the two @entity3 citizens to travel thousands of miles to the bloody @entity71 conflict			1
while they had different professions , the two men knew and talked to each other , said @entity56 's friend @entity132			0
@entity16 , an experienced freelance journalist , made a video in october near the @entity135 - @entity71 border before he embarked on a perilous journey into @entity6 - controlled territory			1
" it is my responsibility if something happens , " he explained			0
@entity16 , 47 , said he was determined to cover what was happening in the region			0
" @entity71 people suffering three years and a half			0
it 's enough , " he said			0
" so i would like to get the story of what @entity6 wants to do			2
" @entity148 , who had worked with @entity16 in @entity71 previously , says he warned him not to enter the @entity6 stronghold of @entity150			2
" i tell him it 's not safe for you , " @entity148 told @entity8			0
but @entity16 chose to go anyway , saying , " i am not @entity66 , i am not @entity153			0
i can go , " @entity148 recalled			0
before he left , @entity16 gave @entity148 a slip of paper with contact information for friends and his wife , the mother of his young children			2
after hearing no word from @entity13 for a week , @entity148 says called the wife			0
" when i called her , she 's a very strong woman , " he said			0
the aims and activities in @entity71 of @entity24 , a 42 - year - old unemployed widower , are murkier			0
he originally headed to the war - ravaged country early last year with the aim of gaining combat and survival experience to bolster his plans to set up a private security company , said his friend @entity132			0
there , @entity56 met @entity16 , who gave him insights on how to survive there , @entity132 said			0
he also introduced him to rebel fighters , who are distinct from @entity6 even though both are fighting against @entity71 president @entity181 's forces			2
some of the rebels talked about their need for ambulances to shuttle the wounded			0
that plea spurred @entity56 to start raising money for this cause after returning to @entity3 , according to @entity132			2
" i felt a chill when he said , after returning home , ( that ) he felt in @entity71 he was really living a life , " @entity132 said			0
