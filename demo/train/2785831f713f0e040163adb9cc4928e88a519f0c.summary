-- the major broadcast networks are deep in the trenches of upfronts week , rebuilding their fall lineups for the future			0
but some people remain trapped in the past â € ” specifically last week , when @entity7 finally canceled " @entity9 " after five seasons of almost canceling " @entity9			1
" rumors immediately began to circle that " @entity9 " would get picked up for a long - prophesied sixth season by someone â € ” @entity14 , or @entity15 , or i guess now @entity17 is a thing ? those rumors led in turn to counter-rumors that @entity9 showrunner / messiah / demonic inspiration @entity22 did n't actually want " @entity9 " to continue			1
and there were probably other rumors , like the rumor about how " @entity9 " star @entity28 's appearance in " @entity29 " was intended to set up a future @entity31 spin - off directed by @entity32 where it turns out the characters on " community " were the @entity36 the whole time			1
@entity0 : community ' season 5 - a visual analysis @entity22 has now taken to @entity39 to clarify his position , in a surprisingly serene post directed at @entity9 fans			1

" @entity0 : ' @entity9 ' canceled @entity22 cautions that " there are lots of reasons a @entity9 resurrection could be difficult			1
" but he also has a nice message for " @entity9 " fans : " i honestly think you can totally sit back and relax for this chapter			1
i know you do n't feel relaxed but i mean you do n't have to worry that someone on this planet is n't aware of this show 's value to its audience			0
there are actually astronauts on a space station right now saying " we get it , you love @entity9 " in @entity81			2
you have done your thing			0
" it 's worth reading @entity22 's whole post , which features , among other things , @entity22 expressing a bit of skepticism about how the new system of tv can actually wind up exploiting fanbases , " like a corporation is doing you a favor by feeding you low grade opiate through a regulated tube			0
" meanwhile , rumors persist that @entity7 is in development on a new limited - run straight - to - series @entity99 drama starring @entity101 , @entity102 through a @entity103			0
