@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 stayed away from a grief - stricken @entity0 after the 1997 death of princess @entity6 , she was criticized for being aloof and failing to respond to public anger and loss			1
but , according to a new account offered by one of the monarch 's closest friends , the truth behind the queen 's decision to temporarily abandon her people was her overwhelming concern for the welfare of @entity6 's sons , princes @entity20 and @entity21			1
@entity22 , the queen 's first cousin and one of her oldest companions , revealed in an interview with @entity2 that the queen chose to remain at her @entity29 residence , @entity30 , because she put her duties as a grandmother over those as a monarch			1
" she was castigated ... for staying up at @entity30 with the two little boys , " @entity22 said , speaking ahead of celebrations to mark the 60th anniversary of the queen 's succession			1
" she was being a proper granny			0
what was the point of bringing the boys down to sit in @entity0 with nothing to do but sit there feeling sad about mum			0
personally i think i would have behaved in exactly the same way			0
" interactive : who 's who in the @entity50 the days after @entity6 's death were among the darkest of the 86 - year - old queen 's reign			1
her failure to appear even as tributes left by thousands of mourners transformed the streets near @entity59 into a sea of flowers , was at the time blamed on an antipathy towards @entity6 that clashed with public affection for the " people 's princess			1
" it was only when @entity68 , then the prime minister , intervened that she returned to @entity0 and acknowledged the outpouring of grief -- a gesture that helped win back waning affections for the royal family			2
" it was very sensible , maybe not as queen , " said @entity22			1
" but she made it all right in the end by coming down and looking at all the flowers			0
" born just a few months after the queen , @entity22 has known the monarch her whole life and is widely seen as one of the greatest sources of insight on life within the royal family			1
after working as a secretary for @entity90 the intelligence agency @entity89 during @entity91 , she served as a lady - in - waiting to the queen 's mother and was one of the queen 's bridesmaids			1
the two have remained steadfast friends throughout their lives			0
@entity22 lives in a house close to the royal residence at @entity103 , west of @entity0 , where she regularly serves the queen a morning tipple of her favorite " booze			1
" " i do see the queen most sundays , " @entity22 told @entity2			1
" we go to the same little church in the park here on sunday and , unless she 's very busy , she comes in and has a drink after church so it keeps up the relationship			2
gin and @entity116 is her booze in the morning			1
" @entity22 also offered insight on the queen 's relationship with prince @entity121 , claiming it was love at first sight when the future monarch , barely into her teens , first encountered the dashing young naval officer , then aged 17			1
" i think she fell in love when she was 13 , " she said			1
" @entity130 he was good looking			0
you know he was a @entity132 god			0
she has never looked at anybody else ever and i think he really truly has been a rock			0
" both as a young girl and in later years , @entity22 paints a picture of her friend as an ordinary woman who is capable of throwing off the airs of royalty			2
she tells of the time , after victory was declared in @entity143 at the end of @entity91 , that @entity22 accompanied the queen and her sister as they celebrated incognito among the crowds outside @entity59			1
" we all surged up to @entity150			0
everybody was kissing everybody and putting on policemens helmets on their heads , you know that sort of thing			0
it went on for four nights running			0
interactive : a year in the life of the queen " we came back to @entity59 and started yelling for the king , the king and queen to come out on the balcony			2
their two daughters were yelling , which was also the first time they had seen the balcony from down below , so it was a magical moment			0
" we did it for several more nights			0
there certainly was one occasion when we were doing the conga			0
we went in one door of the @entity180 and congaed our way through and came out the other door			0
it was all part of the jollifications			0
" speaking about the marital troubles that have blighted three of the queen 's four children -- prince @entity190 , @entity191 and prince @entity192 -- she described the situation as " terribly sad			1
" however , she added , the queen has a sense of humor and an ordinary side to her personality that , had she not taken the throne , would have allowed her to enjoy life outside of royalty			2
" if you are the queen you have to be queenly			2
on her own she 's rather like one of us , she laughs at the same jokes			2
" i mean if she did n't happen to be born as queen she would be the owner of , hopefully , a rather nice country estate where she would have lots and lots of dogs and horses and she 'd be happy			2
