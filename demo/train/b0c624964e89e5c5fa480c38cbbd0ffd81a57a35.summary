-- the @entity2 administration pushed forward sunday on a new path toward military action in @entity5 , urging @entity6 to support the president 's call			1
tests found signatures of sarin gas in blood and hair samples collected from the @entity17 site of an alleged chemical weapons attack , @entity10 secretary of state @entity9 said sunday on @entity0 's @entity19			1
the samples were collected separately from a @entity22 investigation into the august 21 attack and provide further proof that the @entity5 regime attacked its own people , @entity9 said			1
with " each day that goes by , this case is even stronger , " he said , arguing that the @entity10 must act			0
" if you do n't do it , you send a message of impunity , " @entity9 said			1
@entity38 , @entity39 , and @entity40 " will look at the @entity10 and say ' nothing means anything ' -- that 's what 's at stake here , " he said			0
@entity5 denies using chemical weapons on its people and blames the rebels			1
@entity9 called the evidence " overwhelming " sunday , and the @entity45 issued a statement blaming the @entity5 government for the attack			1
but the @entity22 argued that world leaders should wait until @entity22 investigators determine whether chemical weapons were used			2
' red line ' debate : are chemical weapons worse ? " the @entity22 mission is uniquely capable of establishing in an impartial and credible manner the facts of any use of chemical weapons , " @entity55 , spokesman for @entity56 ban ki - moon , said repeatedly at a news conference			1
so when will the results be ready ? the @entity22 wo n't give a timeline , @entity55 said			2
" it 's being done as fast as it is possible to do within the scientific constraints			0
" samples will be delivered to laboratories monday , he said			0
the investigation involves a strict chain of custody and clear guidelines , he said , adding that two @entity5 government officials monitored the process			1
but even when it 's done , the @entity22 will only say whether chemical weapons were used -- not who was responsible			2
@entity2 's last - minute @entity5 switch @entity10 military action appeared imminent until saturday , when @entity2 announced he would first seek lawmakers ' approval			1
@entity2 made a last - minute decision friday evening to seek congressional authorization before any military action , senior administration officials told reporters			2
" while i believe i have the authority to carry out this military action without specific congressional authorization , i know that the country will be stronger if we take this course , and our actions will be even more effective , " @entity2 said saturday			2
the 1973 @entity95 technically allows him to strike without such approval			0
lawmakers officially come back from recess on september 9			0
but some members of @entity6 arrived on @entity100 sunday for a classified briefing on @entity5 with @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity105 officials			2
many of them said they remained skeptical and undecided about how to respond to the august 21 purported chemical weapons attack that @entity10 officials have said killed more than 1,000 people in @entity5 rebel strongholds			1
" there was a great deal of skepticism in the room about the utility , effectiveness and support that we would have for the kind of strike that the president has proposed , " said rep. @entity112 , @entity113			0
" there 's not a lot of skepticism , frankly , about whether or not this was an attack carried out by the @entity5 regime			1
while nobody would say that it 's been proven , the vast bulk of the evidence suggests that this was an attack carried out by the @entity136 regime			0
" sen. @entity137 told @entity138 ' " @entity141 " that @entity2 had invited him to a monday meeting at the @entity102 to discuss the next steps in @entity5			1
@entity137 , who has been pushing for military intervention in @entity5 , said he had questions for the president			2
" i want to find out whether there is a plan and a strategy			0
i want to find out whether this is just a pinprick that somehow @entity136 can trumpet that he defeated the @entity10 , " @entity137 told @entity0			0
" but i will say that if @entity6 overrules a decision of the president of the @entity10 on an issue of national security , that could set a catastrophic precedent in the future			0
it would be a very dangerous precedent to be setting			0
" @entity2 's last - minute decision global debate surges over @entity5 at a meeting in @entity161 sunday , @entity45 foreign ministers condemned the chemical weapons attack , urging the international community to take action and calling for the prosecution of those responsible			1
" the @entity5 regime bears full responsibility for the use of chemical weapons ( in ) this heinous crime , " foreign ministers from the regional organization said in a statement , according to the state - run @entity170			2
" the council also called for providing the required forms of support for the @entity5 people to defend themselves and the need for concerted @entity183 and international efforts to help them , " the statement said			2
@entity45 secretary general @entity184 said in a @entity186 post that the league was calling for the @entity22 @entity188 to " assume its responsibility and take all the deterrent and needed measures against this crime and all crimes of genocide " in @entity5			1
but the statements sunday did not directly refer to the @entity10 , and it 's unclear how much international support the @entity10 government would have if it chooses to strike @entity5			1
at the @entity45 meeting , @entity198 called for international action , but @entity201 said it was opposed to foreign intervention in the @entity5 crisis			1
@entity204 has voted against taking any military action in @entity5 , and @entity206 said it wo n't act without the @entity10 as a partner			2
@entity209 foreign minister @entity208 tweeted sunday that the time gained waiting for @entity10 congressional approval " must be used to reach a common position of the international community within the @entity188			0
" amid the debate over whether to strike @entity5 , @entity10 authorities are tightening domestic security measures			2
the @entity217 and the @entity218 are warning of a higher risk of cyberattacks after months of disruptions by hackers known as the @entity223 , and authorities say more attacks are likely			0
opposition : @entity2 gave false hope the shift to ask for approval from @entity6 left some analysts scratching their heads			1
" the decision - making has been so confused and muddled that it 's difficult to put the word ' wise ' in front of anything they 're doing right now , " @entity0 's @entity231 said on sunday			0
" the administration has hesitated between nonintervention and intervention , and it is caught between those two			0
" the @entity2 administration , @entity231 said , " seems to want to have it both ways , but it ca n't			2
" others praised the president for taking a step to get more buy - in at home and abroad			0
" frankly , i think he looks prudent , and i do n't doubt his resolve on this , " @entity249 , who served as director of national intelligence for two years under president @entity251 , told @entity0 's @entity19			0
" i do n't think he 's looking for an excuse to get out from a box or a situation that he painted himself into			0
" while some praised the president for giving @entity6 a chance to weigh in , a key group of @entity5 dissidents said it was surprised and concerned by @entity2 's new approach			1
" we ca n't understand how you can promise to help those who are being slaughtered every day in the hundreds , giving them false hope , then change your mind and say let 's wait and see , " the @entity267 said			1
@entity38 , a staunch supporter of the @entity5 regime , warned the @entity10 will pay a price if it strikes @entity5			0
@entity5 reacts the @entity5 government has denied that it used chemical weapons in the august 21 attack , saying that jihadists fighting with the rebels used them in an effort to turn global sentiments against the regime			1
@entity286 , a member of @entity5 's parliament , told @entity0 on sunday that she sees no justification for a @entity10 strike on @entity5			0
" there is no legitimacy to make this attack , " she said , accusing rebel groups of using chemical weapons and committing other crimes against humanity			0
@entity5 state media have been packed with critiques of the @entity10 position since @entity2 's announcement saturday			1
an editorial in the state - run @entity303 newspaper sunday said that @entity2 had declared " the beginning of a historic @entity10 retreat			0
" meanwhile , the opposition @entity267 issued a statement aimed at @entity10 lawmakers			0
" the @entity267 calls on the @entity10 congress to carry their historical responsibility towards the @entity5 people and take the right decision to support the @entity10 government approach to stop the killing machine of the @entity5 criminal regime , " the statement said			1
@entity38 : @entity10 military action in @entity5 would spark ' disaster ' opinion : why strikes in @entity5 are a bad idea @entity323 allegedly used previously in @entity5 civil war world leaders have said previously that sarin has been used in the @entity5 civil war			1
in april , the @entity10 said it had evidence sarin was used in @entity5 on a small scale			1
in may , a @entity22 official said there were strong suspicions that rebel forces used the deadly nerve agent			0
