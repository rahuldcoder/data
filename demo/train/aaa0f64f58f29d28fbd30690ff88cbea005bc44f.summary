@entity0 -- president @entity2 gently sparred with @entity3 on " @entity4 " in the final run - up to next week 's midterm elections , after the comedian called his legislative progress " timid			1
" playing off the title of @entity2 's book " @entity11 , " @entity3 challenged the forcefulness of the president 's political agenda during his first two years in office			1
" is the difficulty that you have here the distance between what you ran on and what you delivered ? " @entity3 said			2
" you ran with such , if i may , audacity ... yet legislatively it has felt timid at times			0
" " @entity3 , i love your show , but this is something where i have a profound disagreement with you ... " @entity2 said , leaning forward and intently tapping his finger on the desk , " this notion that health care was timid			1
" " this is what most people would say is as significant a piece of legislation as we have seen in this country 's history , " the president continued , saying the @entity31 will provide health coverage for 30 million people , introduces a patient 's @entity42 and will cut the deficit by over a trillion dollars			0
" what happens is , it gets discounted because the presumption is we did n't get 100 percent of what we wanted , we only get 90 percent of what we wanted -- so let 's focus on the 10 percent we did n't get as opposed to the 90 percent we did , " @entity2 said			2
the 30 - minute program taped at @entity0 's @entity52 took place before a packed house , with some waiting in line for up to four hours to attend			2
" @entity4 " is in @entity0 all week ahead of @entity3 's planned " @entity56 " on the @entity57 on saturday			1
" you ran on the idea that this system needed basic reform ... feels like some reform was done in a political manner that has papered over a system that is corrupt , " @entity3 said , again challenging the pace and extent of change initiated by the @entity2 administration			1
" over the last two years , in emergency situations , our basic attitude was we have to get things done , in some cases quicker , " the president said , acknowledging the global economic crisis that was swirling at the time he took office			0
" [ @entity78 leaders ] worked within the process instead of transforming the process			0
" during a lighter moment , @entity3 presented @entity2 with @entity82 -- a presidential coffee cup			1
the men traded quips over " @entity4 " stage , which resembled a @entity88 temple			2
" this is a nice set , " @entity2 said			0
" it reminds me of the convention			0
" " we actually bought it , it was in a warehouse , " @entity3 retorted			0
the president 's theme of change from the 2008 race resurfaced during the show , along with a popular campaign slogan			1
" when we promised during campaign ' change you can believe in , ' it was n't ' change you can believe in ' in 18 months , " @entity2 said to applause from the audience			1
" we 're going to have to work for it			0
" noting the tough election climate , the president said he hopes @entity78 members of @entity111 are rewarded on election day for the tough votes they took on health care and financial regulatory reform			0
near the end of the interview , @entity2 invoked his famous campaign phrase , " yes we can , but it 's not going to happen overnight , " prompting a laugh from @entity3			1
