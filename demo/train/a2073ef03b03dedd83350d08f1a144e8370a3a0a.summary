-- few will long lament the departure of @entity2 as defense secretary			0
he was a weak choice for the job , seen as a comfortable one for president @entity6 , a former senator he knew who was unlikely to ruffle feathers or be as challenging to work with as his stronger predecessors , @entity11 or @entity12			2
but if @entity6 thinks that pushing out @entity14 will be seen as the housecleaning that many have recommended for his spluttering national security process , he is likely to be very disappointed			1
in the first instance , of course , @entity14 ca n't be seen as the source of the tensions and frequent miscommunication that have existed between the @entity23 and the @entity24			1
nor can @entity24 whispers suggesting that he was n't up to the job , especially with the new threats posed by @entity29 , make that case any more compelling			2
no one can accuse @entity11 or @entity12 of not having been up to the job -- and the tensions with the @entity24 existed with them as well			2
do n't take my word for it			0
yes , things have been coming to a head with @entity14 for a while			2
there was reportedly a tough memo he wrote to national security adviser @entity46 taking issue with the administration 's handling of the crisis in @entity51			1
the details have yet to be leaked , but apparently it caused a firestorm in the @entity24			0
in addition , remarks by @entity14 and senior military officials such as gen. @entity57 on how to fight @entity29 have revealed gaps between the @entity24 and @entity23 thinking that have frustrated officials close to @entity6			1
in fact , it is not passivity or weakness that some thought @entity14 would bring to the job that have caused his downfall			0
rather it was in part caused by his toughness and refusal to be just one more comfortable insider from the @entity76 club that is all @entity6 knew of @entity77 before he took office as president			0
indeed , the real problem that brought down @entity14 had little to do with @entity14 at all			0
it had to do with the fact that since @entity84 took over as national security adviser , the @entity6 administration has been buffeted by a stunning series of foreign policy missteps and challenges that have shaken confidence in the president at home and abroad			1
these include growing chaos in the wake of the intervention in @entity96 , the consequences of pulling out too quickly in @entity104 , compounded by the consequences of failing to take effective action of any sort in @entity51 , the resultant rise of @entity29 , the mishandling of the @entity110 revelations in ways that alienated our allies , the weak response to the @entity99 adventure of @entity100 and a host of related problems			0
none of these can be traced to @entity14			0
rather they are linked to a broken national security process , a president who has become reactive -- not proactive -- and defensive , who is more tactical than strategic and who , unlike past presidents serving a second term , has shown a resistance to growing in office as a statesman			1
in past presidencies , from @entity129 to @entity130 to @entity131 , such growth has been accompanied by changing up their national security teams			1
many have urged @entity6 to oversee such a shake - up			1
@entity14 , who assumed his post shortly after the start of @entity6 's second term , was a sop to these critics			1
easy to dismiss , not very popular and a weak advocate for the administration			0
removing him will be unsettling to those in the @entity23 who realize he is being let go for advocating their views as well as to those throughout the administration who will worry whether getting rid of him will be seen as enough			0
the real changes needed are at a high level in the @entity24 , in the team immediately around the president advising him on national security			1
unless those changes happen , view the @entity14 move as a distraction , as an effort to create the illusion of change where a shake - up is needed .			2

@entity162 : @entity14 's departure is n't the foreign policy housecleaning some have urged
he says @entity14 was n't cause of tensions , miscommunication with @entity24 , @entity23
@entity46 's tenure as national security adviser marked by policy missteps , he says
@entity162 : to grow as statesman , @entity6 must shake up his foreign policy team
