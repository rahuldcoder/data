-- when one of his sparring partners said he was getting married , @entity1 helped the newlyweds buy a house			1
when the poor province in which he grew up in the @entity7 needed a hospital , he ponied up some of the money for one			1
when his country had elections , @entity1 ran twice for and finally won a post in congress			1
he helped start one program to give cattle to farmers and another to give small motors to fishermen for their boats			0
no doubt , the boxing champ has a soft heart			2
except for one man , apparently : his opponent in saturday night 's @entity25 pay - per - view fight , @entity26			1
they have fought twice before			0
after fighting to a draw in the first match , @entity1 won by split - decision in the second			1
@entity26 insists he won both fights			1
it 's not unusual for a boxer to think he won a close match , but after a fight against @entity37 last year , @entity26 wore a shirt that said on the front , " @entity26 beat @entity1 twice ! ! " and on the back it said , " @entity1 , your ( sic ) @entity42			1
" those close to @entity1 say the taunt angered him			1
some say he has prepared for this fight with an intensity they have n't seen from him before			0
asked by reporters last week about the animosity , the boxer said : " i have worked really hard for this fight ... and made a lot of sacrifices for this training camp , " said the soft - spoken @entity1 in halting @entity54			1
" if a knockout comes , that is a bonus for the hard work			0
i just wanted to make sure i was prepared 100 % for this fight			2
" but trainer @entity63 admits that the t - shirt gave @entity1 , rated by @entity65 as the best fighter in the world regardless of weight , an " extra spark			1
" @entity1 usually spars at 50 % intensity , leaving some energy for the fight , said @entity63			1
this time , during an extended 10 - week training camp , the " @entity1 " has upped it to at least 70 %			1
during a recent talk with one of his sparring partners after a workout , the 144 - pound @entity1 exclaimed , " i want this fight ! i want this fight			2
" and earlier this week @entity1 said @entity26 had disrespected him and he was out to prove who was better , not for a huge payday			1
@entity1 , 33 , will earn many millions for this fight against @entity26 , an often overlooked superstar who is rated by @entity84 as the fifth - best fighter pound - for - pound			1
depending on pay - per - view sales @entity1 will make more than $ 30 million			1
( the fight , for @entity1 's welterweight title , will be televised on @entity89 , which like @entity0 is owned by @entity90			2
) @entity1 's success in the ring and his generosity have made him a national icon			2
" he came from extreme poverty , " @entity95 , mayor of @entity96 , told @entity0 's @entity97 in 2009			0
" now that he has everything in life he still practices that extreme humbleness in his heart			0
that 's why he is so loved by our people here			0
" when he was young , @entity1 sold candy and cigarettes on the streets			2
there were days he did n't make enough to eat			0
at 14 , he ran away -- stowed away , actually -- to @entity110 to help earn more money for his siblings and single mother			0
at first he was a laborer , but he soon learned he could earn 100 pesos ( a few @entity114 dollars ) fighting unsanctioned bouts -- the kind where the losers occasionally died			0
motivated by the death of a friend , @entity1 eventually succeeded in turning pro. he won his first 11 fights , televised on friday nights , making him a national celebrity			1
but the big money was in the @entity114 , and eventually with a 33 - 2 record and a super-bantamweight ( 122 pounds ) title , he moved to @entity114 in 2001 at age 22			0
he and his manager flew to @entity130 and took a bus to @entity132 where someone directed them to the @entity135 in @entity136			0
that 's where @entity1 met boxing - trainer @entity139			1
the two are a strong team , said long - time trainer @entity142 , who will serve as an analyst for the tv broadcast			0
" there is an unbelievable chemistry there , " @entity142 said			0
" they really seem to understand each other			0
@entity63 has done a great job with him			0
" that includes with letting @entity1 be a free spirit when he 's not boxing			1
you would think @entity63 would be upset with all the things @entity1 does outside the ring -- politician , game show host , businessman , pitchman -- but the trainer embraces it			2
" i like the separation , " @entity63 said			0
" he does n't keep his mind on the fight all the time			0
when he gets in the ring , it 's nothing but boxing			0
but if he wants to go on @entity169 , if he wants to go sing , i have no problem with that			0
" many @entity114 know of @entity1 from the ring or his @entity175 commercials or his appearances singing on late night tv			1
but do n't assume that just because he is the pound - for - pound best fighter that he 'll easily handle @entity26 , the @entity180 and @entity182 lightweight champion			2
" out of the 24 rounds they fought he 's ahead by one point , " @entity142 said			0
" @entity1 -- sometimes when he goes forward he 's so excited , he almost runs in and he gets his legs crossed up			2
and @entity26 catches him after that when @entity1 is off balance			1
" @entity142 said @entity63 has made @entity1 a better fighter , helping him improve his lead right hand			1
that combined with the fact that @entity1 throws amazingly quick punches from " so many weird angles " leads @entity142 to predict a @entity1 victory			2
although he would be a very nervous bettor , he said , if he were to lay money down			0
after the fight , it 'll be back to work in congress for @entity1			1
it 'll be every bit the battle as a fight in the ring , he said			0
@entity7 politics are rife with corruption , he told @entity0 's @entity209			2
" that 's what i am trying to do , to change politics in the @entity7 , " he said in an interview to be broadcast friday night			1
" i want ( to show ) to them that i am the good example , to serve honestly			0

@entity1 fights @entity26 for the third time on saturday night
the @entity7 boxer fled his *impoverished* roots , took up boxing to make money for family
now he shares his fortune with others , helping to buy stuff for people in need
he also is a *member* of congress , looking to make changes to the political *system*
