-- the @entity3 governor 's proposal to decriminalize the public possession of marijuana is drawing high praise from some politicians and police , black and @entity10 activists and backers of pot legalization			1
" it is a step in the right direction , " said the rev. @entity13 , a prominent @entity15 - @entity14 political activist			1
but some voices issued warnings about the proposal , with one group , the @entity21 , arguing that it is not the time " to be backing off the marijuana law			1
" @entity3 gov. @entity24 unveiled the proposal monday and said the law would end a double standard that has disproportionately hurt black and @entity10 youth			1
in 1977 , @entity3 's legislature reduced the penalty for possessing 25 grams or less of marijuana to a non-criminal violation carrying a fine of no more than $ 100 for first - time offenders , as long as the marijuana was in private possession and not in public view			1
if the marijuana is out and viewable in public -- as it might be when someone is asked to empty his or her pockets during a police " stop and frisk " -- it becomes a @entity47 misdemeanor and can lead to arrests and jail			1
the " stop and frisk " policy allows police to stop and search anyone they deem suspicious			0
in 2011 , more than 50,000 arrests were made for small amounts of marijuana , the governor 's office said			1
half of those arrested were under 25 years old , and 82 % were black or @entity10			0
less than 10 % were ever convicted of a crime			0
selling and smoking or burning marijuana is still a crime , and @entity24 is not suggesting changing that			1
" if you possess marijuana privately , it is a violation			2
if you show it in public , it 's a crime			2
it 's inconsistent the way it has been enforced , " @entity24 said in @entity73 on monday			1
as a result , thousands of young people have wound up " with a permanent stain on their record for something that would otherwise be a violation			0
the charge makes it difficult for them to find a job , " @entity24 said			1
his proposal won praise from some legislators , police , the @entity92 district attorney and @entity3 mayor @entity93			2
but some say the proposal is counterproductive			2
@entity96 , special adviser to the @entity97 and a criminal defense lawyer in @entity99 , said the group is " very very concerned with this latest development			1
" " this can be seen by the young people as approving the use of marijuana , and they will most likely use marijuana			2
marijuana of today is much more addictive and much more potent , and it poses health and criminal problems			1
" @entity3 assemblyman @entity110 said he doubts legislators will back the proposal because of " pushback " from the community			2
he argues that marijuana possession is a federal crime , and " it does not make sense to pass guidelines at the state level that contradicts federal laws			2
" " this is a wrong message to send across the country , " he said			0
" this should be a decision at the federal level to be interpreted for all the 50 states			0
" he said the @entity127 should make sure the plan follows the proper protocol			0
" this is not a states - rights issue			0
this is a drug issue			0
in this case , this is a controlled - substance issue , " he said			0
but @entity13 , president of the @entity136 , said the proposal would address police abuse			2
" we have been convinced , given the data , that @entity143 and @entity144 does not alleviate crime but instead increases the racial profiling exposure of mostly young @entity147 and @entity10 , " he said in a statement			0
@entity148 , executive director of the @entity149 , which supports legalizing marijuana , said he expects legislators to " faithfully embrace " the proposal			1
he also said the proposal is " a political no - brainer " because most @entity14 will someday back " marijuana possession in small amounts			1
" he said @entity24 , who might one day might have presidential aspirations , is positioning himself as the " marijuana law reformer			1
" @entity159 , a psychiatrist , retired professor at @entity160 and expert on drug policy , said @entity24 's move is " a step on the way of what is inevitable			1
" " adults should be allowed to use marijuana responsibly , in much the way we use alcohol , " he said			2
" it 's not just because it 's a civil liberties issue			2
it is very important to furthering marijuana as a medicine			2
" he said marijuana has been used in the treatment of cancer , multiple sclerosis , @entity182 and glaucoma			2
@entity184 , professor of law and public policy at the @entity186 , said a dozen states have decriminalized small amounts , usually up to an ounce for a first - time possession , and most of the legal changes took place in the 1970s			2
an expert on marijuana laws , @entity184 said the " decriminalization label has mattered less and less " over time			1
" first , the other 38 states have become less and less likely to send convicted marijuana possession felons to prison			0
second , states that have ' decriminalized ' -- like @entity3 -- still make lots of arrests for marijuana			0
few of those arrested will end up in prison , but they may do a short jail stint			0
" and echoing concerns about the stain of an arrest for marijuana , he said , " there is a lasting effect on their records , which hurts their employability			1
" @entity184 said the " big change " over the past 10 years " is the partial legalization of medical marijuana in many states			1
" " recent polls suggest that roughly half of @entity14 voters now support some form of legalization ; if current trends continue , i think we 'll see a state legalize marijuana soon , perhaps even this november			1
but there will be a thorny conflict with federal laws that prohibit marijuana , " he said			0
he points out that medical marijuana or decriminalization ca n't be confused with " true legalization			1
" he called decriminalization a " sensible reform " and not a " risky " legal change			0
" marijuana possession sanctions have almost no measurable effect on levels of marijuana use			0
so it is not clear whether any valid purpose is being served by all the marijuana arrests in @entity3 , and people of color are much more likely to be arrested even though they are not more likely to be marijuana users , " he said			0
" legalization is more complicated , because the steep drop in prices would be difficult to offset with a sustainable tax , and so consumption would probably increase			0
" manhattan district attorney @entity257 said , " the human costs to each defendant charged with a misdemeanor are serious			0
" " the simple and fair change proposed by @entity262 will help us redirect significant resources to the most violent criminals and serious crime problems , and , frankly , it is the right thing to do			0
" the governor 's office said 94 % of arrests for small amounts of marijuana in the state are in @entity275 , and @entity276 , the @entity277 and police commissioner @entity278 have come under fire in recent years for the department 's " stop and frisk " policy			1
last year , @entity278 issued a policy order directing officers to issue violations , rather than misdemeanors , for small amounts of marijuana discovered during street searches			0
on monday , @entity276 issued a statement in support of @entity24 's comments			1
" the governor 's proposal today is consistent with the commissioner 's directive and strikes the right balance by ensuring that the @entity277 will continue to have the tools it needs to maintain public safety -- including making arrests for selling or smoking marijuana , " he said			1
" thanks to the @entity277 , our city has come a long way from the days when marijuana was routinely sold and smoked on our streets without repercussions			0
" @entity278 said monday , " i was asked to respond to criticism by some members of the ( @entity309 ) council that the @entity310 was making ' too many ' arrests for small amounts of marijuana			0
and my response to them was , ' well , your option is to go to @entity73 and get the law changed			0
' better that than having @entity275 police officers turn a blind eye to the law as it was written , and as it is still written			0
" and , with the backing of the mayor and the governor , it 's hard to fathom any significant opposition to the proposal will arise , said @entity327 , an associate professor in the @entity328 at @entity329 in @entity3			1
" it 's a positive move , " he said			1
@entity0 's @entity331 contributed to this report .			0

one expert says the move is a step toward the " inevitable " : legalization
the proposal has a good chance because @entity276 and @entity24 support it , a professor said
a marijuana arrest hurts a person 's chances for employment , the governor says
an *anti-drug* group official says marijuana " poses health and criminal problems "
