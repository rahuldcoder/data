we are currently considering other approaches to our search , " he said			0

responding to local reports that it may have been threats of imminent gun battles by the @entity61 cartel that led to @entity2 officials to suspend the search , @entity43 said , " negative			1
" " we have no official information of threats on our investigators			0
" @entity23 's mother said that " we 're very disappointed " in the development			2
" the longer this goes the less chance there is of finding @entity9 , " she said			2
@entity18 told authorities the couple was on a sightseeing trip on @entity16 , a reservoir on the @entity74			1
she believes the attackers may still have her husband 's body			0

he sat right next to me , " @entity9 said , referring to @entity2 state official @entity117			1
her remarks aired on @entity0 's " @entity120			0
" we talked through a translator and he just seemed like a really good guy who really wanted to just do good for -- you know , his country , " @entity9 said			2

" it definitely makes me worried that nobody is going to want to take over , " she said			0
on thursday , secretary of state @entity133 said the @entity4 is doing everything it can to find @entity9 and told @entity137 's " @entity136 " that she is " sickened " by the case			2
" i hope that we can [ find him ] , " said @entity138			0
" i mean , the beheaded body of the brave @entity2 investigator that just showed up shows what we 're dealing with			2
" she said the @entity4 is " supporting local law enforcement , supporting the authorities on the border , doing everything that we know to do to try to assist in helping to find the body and helping to find the perpetrators			0
" a report issued by a @entity40 - based think tank suggested thursday that @entity9 's death may have stemmed from a case of mistaken identity in the ongoing war between two @entity2 drug cartels			1
the @entity161 report , which cites anonymous sources , noted that @entity9 worked for an oil and gas company with operations in @entity165 , @entity2			1
the couple had lived there for two years and had only moved to @entity39 within the past few months , the report said			0
the truck they drove to @entity16 on september 30 still had a license plate from @entity2 's @entity44 state			1
the couple drove their personal watercraft to the @entity177 area of the lake , which the report said is a " known battleground in the ongoing war in the @entity61 and @entity183 cartels			0
" the sources told @entity161 both cartels have been known to conduct surveillance and countersurveillance operations on personal watercraft , so @entity61 scouts identified them as possible @entity183 spies , because of their license plate and their method and direction of travel on @entity16			2
they were then apparently confronted by " @entity61 enforcers , " @entity161 said			0
the sources told @entity161 the attack was unauthorized by senior @entity61 members and " a damage control campaign is currently under way ... to identify and eliminate those who engaged the @entity201 without proper authorization			0
" protocol involves prompt disposition of a body to ensure no evidence can be brought against the group , the report said			0
sources said that " once @entity9 was identified as an @entity4 , his body was destroyed the same day as the incident to prevent a backlash from the @entity4 government against the group , " @entity161 said			0
" with the heavy diplomatic and public pressure on both @entity4 and @entity2 authorities to find @entity9 's remains in the investigation , the decapitation of @entity117 was a stern signal to both the @entity4 and @entity2 that no body will be produced and to leave the situation alone			1
" @entity224 is about 70 miles west of the @entity201 ' home in @entity39			0
@entity0 's @entity226 , @entity227 and @entity228 contributed to this report .			0
