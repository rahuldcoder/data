-- the @entity1 is back and we ca n't wait to get started			1
ahead of tuesday 's opening group games in @entity5 's biggest club competition , we take you through everything you need to know			1
can @entity8 retain its title ? will @entity10 and @entity11 break the goalscoring record ? can @entity13 win it with a third different club ? all will be revealed on june 6 in @entity16 , but here 's the guide to who , what , where and when -- it 's the @entity1 and it 's back			1
can real do it again ? no club has ever successfully defended the @entity1 title since the competition was revamped in 1992			1
and @entity8 , which won " la decima " last season , it 's 10th @entity1 , will face a struggle to handle the challenge despite its star - studded squad			1
@entity31 , the manager , can call upon the mercurial talents of @entity10 , @entity33 , @entity34 and the latest " @entity35 " to arrive in the @entity37 capital -- @entity38			2
@entity39 , part of the @entity42 team which lifted the trophy in 2013 , has also made the move to @entity45 and slots into midfield alongside @entity48			1
but while there have been plenty of arrivals , @entity8 has lost key players with the departures of @entity54 to @entity42 and @entity55 to @entity56			1
results have been sketchy too -- a defeat by rival @entity59 in the @entity60 was disappointing but nowhere near as embarrassing as the 4 - 2 loss against @entity62			2
on saturday it was also beaten at home in the league -- by rivals @entity59 again			2
@entity8 will start its @entity1 campaign at home against @entity69 side @entity68 before facing @entity72 minnow @entity70 and @entity73			1
@entity75 's biting point ? after the disappointment of losing out to @entity77 's @entity59 in last year 's semifinal and failing to win the league title , @entity75 has turned to one of football 's bad boys to reinvigorate its squad			2
@entity84 , the man banned for biting , will miss the club 's first three @entity1 matches as he serves a four - month suspension following his transgression at the @entity88			1
he will return to action in " @entity90 " against @entity8 on october 25 and will then be available for selection in all forms of football			1
@entity84 's goals helped propel @entity73 into the @entity1 following a successful season on @entity96			1
he will now link up with @entity11 and @entity97 in one of the most frightening front threes in the game but can he keep his cool at @entity102 ? ronaldo vs. @entity11 another season , another showdown			2
@entity10 and @entity11 are both aiming to become the competition 's record scorer and surpass @entity109 's total of 71			2
both @entity8 's @entity10 and @entity75 's @entity11 have scored 67 each and are on the brink of moving ahead of @entity109 , who has led the scoring charts since february 2001			1
@entity10 has scored at least 10 goals in each of his past three @entity1 campaigns and last year he set a single - season record with an astonishing 17			1
@entity11 has managed at least eight in his past six @entity1 seasons but can he stop @entity8 from defending its title ? dare to @entity118 ? are referees scared of @entity118 ? that 's one view being espoused by @entity123 captain @entity122 , whose side drew 1 - 1 with @entity118 's @entity125 last week			1
@entity118 appeared to elbow @entity126 during the @entity128 qualifier but somehow escaped any disciplinary action			0
" it was a red card for me			0
the referee was scared of @entity118 , " said @entity122			0
but @entity118 is @entity118 and the forward who will spearhead @entity135 's @entity1 challenge , had a different version of events			1
" the referee has everything under control , " he told reporters			0
" he [ @entity126 ] goes into me twice and the third time i try to shield the ball and he [ @entity126 ] is 1.50m or 1.60m tall and then he obviously reaches up to my elbow			0
" @entity118 will be on his own personal tour of former clubs with @entity135 set to face both @entity75 and @entity148			0
@entity151 side @entity149 complete the group			0
@entity42 pepped up ? after winning the trophy against @entity155 at @entity156 in 2013 , last year 's competition was a real disappointment for @entity42			0
under new manager @entity159 , it reached the semifinals where it imploded by losing 4 - 0 at home to @entity8 in the second leg			1
a 5 - 0 aggregate defeat was an embarrassing end to a campaign which had begun with much promise			0
this time though , @entity42 is back and looking even stronger			0
it has added @entity168 , the former @entity155 striker , while @entity169 has joined from @entity170			0
@entity39 and @entity172 have both moved on but @entity42 retain a formidable look			0
@entity176 and @entity177 pose a threat on the wings , @entity174 and @entity175 both enjoyed an excellent @entity88 campaign with @entity181 , while @entity182 has enjoyed a strong start to the season			0
why is @entity185 so unlucky ? @entity185 has had a raw deal in the @entity1 so far			1
it might be the best team in @entity187 but because of the way the seeding system works , it has often been given the toughest possible group draws			2
this time around it faces @entity42 , @entity192 and @entity194 side @entity193 in what has been labeled as the " @entity196			0
" in 2011 , @entity185 had a similar experience after being paired with @entity42 , @entity198 and @entity199 -- a group from which it failed to escape			0
a year later , it got worse			0
@entity185 failed to win a single group game after being lumped in with eventual finalist @entity155 , @entity8 and @entity148			1
last season , @entity185 finally got over the first hurdle along with @entity42 , though it was then beaten in the round of 16 by @entity75			2
this time around , @entity207 's team will open its campaign at the @entity209 against @entity42 -- its never easy for @entity185			2
@entity211 security @entity211 faces a real challenge to progress from its group after being forced to play its games 600 miles away in @entity216			0
the @entity218 - @entity194 conflict has already meant the club has switched its league fixtures to @entity221 but now it faces playing at another of the country 's stadiums			0
@entity211 is in @entity225 along with @entity226 , @entity227 and 2004 champion @entity228			0
money , money , money @entity8 was the big winner both on and off the field last season			1
the champion earned $ 74.3 million from its run to the final which includes the $ 13.5 million it pocketed for winning the competition			2
according to figures provided by @entity244 , teams in the @entity1 and @entity242 shared more than $ 1.4 billion in prize money last season			1
even @entity247 side @entity246 , which failed to win a single game in last season 's group stage , went home with over $ 15.5 million			0
the 32 clubs in this season 's group stage could earn a minimum of $ 11 million , while there is a $ 1.3 million on offer for each victory and $ 650,000 for a draw			2
teams which reach the round of 16 will earn $ 4.5 million each , the quarterfinalists $ 5 million and the semifinalists $ 6.3 million			1
the champion will collect a cool $ 13.5 million with the second placed side picking up $ 8.4 million			0
who 's not coming to the party ? while some of the world 's top players will be in action there are plenty who will be missing from the @entity1			1
@entity56 , which last failed to qualify for the @entity1 in 1995 , is the biggest loser along with @entity277 duo @entity275 and @entity198			1
@entity56 's absence means the likes of @entity280 , @entity281 and @entity282 will all have to watch the action from their sofas			0
while @entity56 and @entity275 both failed to qualify for the @entity242 , @entity198 will be involved			0
@entity285 , @entity286 and @entity287 will be the three to watch for @entity289 's side .			0
