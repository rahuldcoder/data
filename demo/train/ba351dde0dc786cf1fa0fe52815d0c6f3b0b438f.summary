there are nine of us from the @entity3 in @entity4 , @entity5			1
we arrived from different @entity7 states , or from the @entity9 's polio team already in @entity5 , and possess varying skill sets , including infection control , global migration and quarantine , data management , epidemiology and communications			1
we 're here to work with colleagues and partners from @entity5 's @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and the @entity22 to stop the largest @entity24 outbreak in history -- the first in a densely populated , urban environment			1
@entity5 is the latest country to become affected by the outbreak			1
the first person to die of @entity24 here was an @entity7 named @entity30 , who arrived from @entity32			2
now who suspects @entity5 has had 12 cases and three deaths			1
our team in @entity4 is a small part of the @entity9 's effort to fight @entity24 , with work going on in several @entity41 countries , and back in the @entity7 at our headquarters in @entity43			1
there , the @entity9 's @entity44 has activated its highest level to maintain 24/7 operations to coordinate the agency 's efforts			2
we are five hours ahead of @entity43 , a fact my family has yet to grasp as i receive texts during odd hours asking , " what 's @entity4 like ? " and " what are you doing ? " good questions			2
a typical day for our team begins at a hotel -- one big advantage of an urban outbreak			2
after breakfast we move to one of several locations , including the hospital , @entity7 consulate or a training site , depending on the work to be done that day			0
@entity68 is working as part of a much larger team in @entity5 to find and isolate all possible patients , tracking down everyone who could have been exposed to @entity24 , and educating the public about the risks			1
a great deal has been accomplished in a short time			0
a @entity5 emergency operations center is up and running now , and we are about to move @entity24 patients into a newly , remodeled treatment facility			1
there are 60 folks on the contact tracing team , which has been tracking more than 200 people thought to have come in contact with the virus			1
these teams visit the contacts daily to take their temperatures and check to see if they have developed any symptoms			0
on tuesday , 147 of the 152 contacts were visited and assessed			0
when difficulties arise locating contacts , additional teams are employed and efforts ramped up to conduct the tracing			0
the ebola response team in @entity5 recently saw 30 people finish the 21 - day risk period -- the longest time period during which @entity24 symptoms have been known to be present			1
these 30 people were able to leave the contact tracing list , which is a hopeful sign			0
there is a great deal of fear in @entity4 as many worry about a virus of which they know precious little			2
@entity9 communicators like myself work to provide accurate information to the public and health care workers			1
health care workers are critical as they are on the front lines of this battle ; who says 10 % of the deaths during this epidemic have been health care workers			1
our infection control experts have been training workers on proper infection control and teaching them how to don @entity126 properly , a critical task given this virus			1
i was taking pictures of this training near the @entity24 ward when one of the trainers came out of the " hot zone " and asked if anybody had a paperback to give one of the patients			1
i donated a weathered copy of @entity141 's " @entity140 , part 1			0
" ( i always carry a book on deployments )			0
so the @entity141 has entered the @entity24 ward in @entity4			1
one interesting aspect of this outbreak has been the rumors and misinformation spurred by @entity24			2
last week , communicators were working quickly to respond to a rumor that bathing in or drinking salt water would prevent @entity24			2
i have seen local press coverage that notes two people may have died from attempting this treatment			0
as i write this , we are in a temporary emergency operations center at a psychiatric hospital , waiting for remodeling to be complete on our own center			0
we made the change with some grumbling but did not miss a beat -- flexibility is essential in an evolving outbreak situation			0
our work is made more difficult by traffic in the city , a lack of internet connectivity and security , which is a concern			0
we typically make it back to the hotel late , anywhere between 9 and 11 p.m. local time and try to eat together			0
team members who gather are tired , and the outbreak dominates the conversation			2
but we also try to distract ourselves : on my third night , a team member asked , " has anyone else noticed that the background music is all @entity179 ? " it was true			0
turns out she has quite a few songs , and i am pretty sure we have heard them all			0
i am not afraid of catching the ebola virus			0
i know how @entity24 is transmitted and will not put myself in jeopardy , thinking of my wife and four children at home			0
the work is long , hard , challenging but worthwhile			0
the @entity9 team in @entity4 is amazing , one of the best i have been on			1
and the larger response team that includes all our partners and our colleagues from @entity5 is doing important work to break the ebola infection cycle .			1

the @entity9 has sent nine people to @entity4 , @entity5 , to fight the @entity24 outbreak
the @entity22 says @entity5 has 12 suspected cases , three deaths
@entity9 team is helping with tracking the infection , training health care workers
