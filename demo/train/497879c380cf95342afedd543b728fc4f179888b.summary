@entity1 one 's out and another looks like he 's back in			0
and another is building up his 2016 team			2
the 2016 @entity6 presidential field has been shaping up in more ways than one in the last week			0
here 's who 's stirring the pot , and what they 're mixing in : @entity13 , @entity13 ... @entity13 ? a week after former @entity15 gov. @entity14 spent his time locking in support from the @entity6 establishment 's top @entity6 donors , former @entity6 presidential nominee @entity13 set fire to the political world on friday when he signaled to a roomful of donors that he 's seriously considering a 2016 presidential bid			1
@entity13 is giving more than just a cursory glance at his 2016 presidential prospects			2
after meeting with prospective donors , @entity13 reportedly spent the weekend phoning former operatives and backers , signaling that he 's not kidding about a three - peat presidential campaign			1
@entity13 is also headed to a @entity32 meeting near @entity33 this week , a get together that will include other potential 2016ers including @entity36 , @entity38 gov. @entity37 and @entity40 gov. @entity39			1
the former nominee 's moves over the weekend are the surest sign yet that he will enter what is expected to be a competitive fray of @entity6 contenders duking it out for the nomination			2
the buzz comes months after @entity13 kicked up speculation this summer when he gave several interviews suggesting that while a 2016 run was unlikely , it was n't completely out of the question			1
and @entity13 's wife , who went back and forth this summer on whether @entity13 2016 was a possibility -- ultimately settling on " we never say never " -- is now reportedly on board			1
it 's @entity13 's sons who are split , according to sources who spoke with @entity13 this weekend			1
the move could set up a battle of political heavyweights between the @entity13 and @entity14 operations -- one few expected just last week			2
@entity66 launching @entity67 fresh off his state of the state speech , the @entity68 broke the news tuesday night that the @entity72 governor is preparing to set up a leadership political action committee as soon as this month to finance his political travel and allow him to begin fundraising			0

@entity92 taps campaign manager the @entity94 reported on tuesday that sen. @entity92 of @entity95 is hiring @entity96 to run his likely 2016 presidential campaign -- while @entity98 will remain @entity92 's chief political adviser			2
the hiring of @entity96 , a @entity101 political veteran who ran @entity6 @entity103 's successful bid for the @entity106 governor 's office in 2014 , gives @entity92 a veteran hand who has won in blue states			0
@entity110 a no - go as @entity13 is jumping back in , his former running mate rep. @entity110 is shutting down speculation over a presidential run of his own			1
" after giving it a lot of thought , i 've decided not to run for president , " @entity110 said monday in a statement , pointing instead to his focus as the new chair of the @entity117 as his priority			0
@entity110 insisted despite the conspicuous timing that he came to a decision over the holidays , well before @entity13 seized headlines this weekend with talk of another run			1
@entity110 has been a steadfast @entity13 supporter since before the former @entity130 governor tapped him as his vice presidential pick			1
@entity37 makes moves the governor of @entity38 , widely viewed as a rising @entity6 star , is set to launch a new political organization in the coming weeks , laying the groundwork for a potential presidential campaign			2
@entity37 brought on a national political strategist who would serve as his campaign manager in the event of a potential run , @entity6 sources told @entity2 's @entity143			1
and remember , he 'll be headed to the @entity32 meeting , too , this week			0
but like a pair of other @entity6 governors with presidential ambitions , @entity37 could face some questions on his handling of his state 's economy in an eventual campaign			2
@entity153 former @entity154 gov. @entity153 is giving @entity155 a taste of a classic pre-presidential campaign move : he 's releasing a new book			1
@entity153 's book , " @entity165 , @entity166 , @entity167 , and @entity168 , " hits stores next week , but a sneak peak reveals an interesting mishmash of insight into @entity153 's brain			1
the release comes after @entity153 quit his @entity171 show earlier this month to give a 2016 campaign a serious look			1
the book 's got everything from musings on @entity177 and @entity178 © to an explanation of his views on homosexuality and even his thoughts on his potential 2016 rivals			1
@entity14 so , @entity14 did n't have the best week after @entity13 swooped in and stole some of his thunder -- and nearly all of the headlines			2
but @entity14 did give donors a glimpse at what his 2016 operation would look like during his first fundraiser for his new @entity67 , " right to rise			1
" a few snippets include promoting a muscular @entity155 foreign policy and his plan to pursue a diverse electorate			0
@entity36 the @entity197 conservative who has been inching toward a presidential run took some heat last week over plagiarism allegations			0
@entity36 apologized after he was caught lifting material from unattributed sources in his book , @entity204			0
" i attempted to appropriately cite and acknowledge all sources in @entity204 , but inadvertently missed some			0
i apologize , and i am working with my editors to rectify the situation , " @entity36 said in a statement to @entity2			0
... what about the @entity210 ? efforts to recruit sen. @entity214 are still underway , former @entity212 gov. @entity211 is breaking in a new knee and @entity216 has n't made a public appearance in almost a month			0
as the @entity6 field keeps shifting , democrats are left wondering ... what field ? progressive groups are holding a rally on saturday in an effort to get @entity224 to jump in , but the liberal senator is looking more like she wo n't run in 2016 , giving @entity227 magazine a flat " no " when asked whether she 'll run for president -- her most decisive answer yet			1
@entity231 gov. @entity230 wants voters to know he 's not out of the running , though			0
he told an audience on thursday that he is " seriously considering " a presidential run .			0

@entity13 stole the show of potential 2016 candidates this weekend , telling donors and operatives that he 's looking at 2016
