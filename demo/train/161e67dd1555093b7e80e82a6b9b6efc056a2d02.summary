-- a private @entity2 television station openly critical of president @entity3 said friday it will pay a hefty fine after the country 's highest court ordered that its assets be seized			1
the supreme court 's announcement , which came down thursday evening , ordered seizure of the broadcaster 's property and equipment for failure to pay a $ 2.2 million fine levied last year			1
@entity16 is currently fighting the fine in court , and accused the high court of interfering with their appeal process			1
the station also questioned why the supreme court ordered seizures worth $ 5.7 million , more than double the value of the original fine			1
the high court 's " grotesque and despotic " decision forces the station to pay the original fine immediately , before its validity is decided in a lower court , @entity16 said			1
in its statement , the court said the seizure amount was the calculation of twice the original fine , plus the costs of executing the action			1
@entity16 is @entity2 's last remaining television broadcaster that is openly critical of president @entity3			1
the seizure announcement comes days before the electoral campaign officially kicks off			0
the original fine stems from @entity16 's coverage of a standoff at the @entity45 prison in june and july			1
the station violated a law that prohibits stirring anxiety in the public and instigating intolerance for political reasons , officials charged			0
these are violations under a media responsibility law passed in december			0
the stated goal of the law is to establish " social responsibility " in those who provide television , radio and internet service			0
the law affects all text , images , sound or context sent or received in @entity2			0
@entity16 defended its coverage of the prison standoff , which started with a riot that killed at least 22 people and turned into a nearly monthlong standoff between prisoners and national guard troops			0
but not paying the fine immediately could risk the station being shuttered , @entity16 said			2
" @entity16 is very clear about its responsibility to forge ahead , to stay open and to remain the principal space for criticism and free , independent news , " the station said in a written statement			0
@entity3 loyalist @entity80 , president of the country 's national assembly , said on his @entity84 account that @entity16 " still believes it is above the law and the time to pay arrived today			2
" over the years , the government has launched various investigations into @entity16 -- looking , for instance , at its reporting about an earthquake before an official report had been issued , and failing to pay about $ 2.3 million in taxes			2
station officials have said the charges are politically motivated			0
in 2010 , the government secured a 25.8 % interest in the broadcaster when it took over two companies , one owning a 20 % stake in @entity16 and the other , a 5.8 % stake .			2

@entity2 's supreme court orders the seizure of @entity16 's assets
the private broadcaster will pay a fine to avoid the action
the station says the supreme court is interfering with an appeal to the original fine
the government and @entity16 have been at odds for years
