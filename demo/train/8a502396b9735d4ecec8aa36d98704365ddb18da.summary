@entity0 -- he , or perhaps she , is described as " hairless , " " pink , " " wiggly , " " the size of a stick of butter " and " very vocal			0
" in other words , beautiful ! for a panda			1
the @entity12 's joyous announcement monday of the birth of a still - nameless panda is giving @entity0 something to celebrate			1
here , in the city that is just coming off a blazing hot summer and entering the quadrennial exercise in self - immolation we call a presidential election , the birth of a panda is giving the city something else to talk about			1
@entity26 birth in @entity0 : ' we are thrilled ' the 4 - ounce baby , the second offspring of @entity29 ( pronounced may - shong ) , is believed to be the first birth in this city that was n't used by politicians as a grim reminder of the future cost of college tuition , or by government actuaries to recalculate the pending bankruptcy of the social security trust fund			1
it is the perfect birth for our imperfect times			1
a zookeeper was the first to recognize the momentous occasion was at hand			0
pandas are notoriously difficult to impregnate , because of a very short fertility period			0
and scientists often must wait until a baby is born before they can confirm efforts at artificial insemination are successful			1
the zookeeper , listening to a monitor , " heard the vocalizations of the cub , " @entity49 , a senior curator at the zoo told reporters monday			0
" and she immediately called ( another of the zoo 's panda keepers ) to confirm ... and they called me as well			1
and the three of us kind of sat in front of our computer screens in our individual houses about 11 o'clock last night going , ' did you hear that ? ' ' did you hear that ? ! ' ' did you hear that ! ? ' " and once we confirmed that , yes indeed , it really was a cub , once our kind of disbelief and our incredible job and elation , we overcame that , and we started calling everyone and bringing them in			0
" another curator checked the videotape to see if it had recorded the moment of birth			1
" we did n't see the cub come out , but we saw her reaction and it was that kind of ( the ) ' @entity84 ! ' reaction that she had when she had ( her first baby in 2005 ) , " @entity49 said			1
" and fortunately she was a great mother this time and she turned around immediately , picked at that cub , cradled it and took care of it right away			0
" zoo officials have pronounced @entity29 a fit , loving and caring mother			0
" she 's such a fantastic mother , " said panda keeper @entity95			1
" she did a wonderful job with ( her other cub ) and we 're confident she 'll do a great job again this time			0
it 's great to see her with a cub tucked under her chin like she did so many years ago and it 's great , for the zoo , it 's great for all of us that have been around with her for so long			0
" for now , the baby is nameless			1
the zoo says it will follow the @entity110 tradition of naming the panda 100 days after it is born			2
zoo officials predict attendance will increase by a half - million people this year because of the panda			2
for @entity0 , and for a nation desperate for unity , it is the perfect election - year gift			2
pandas are tri-racial ( being both black and white and @entity119 in origin ) , non-denominational , and non-partisan , evoking neither the size of @entity123 elephants nor the temperament of @entity126 donkeys			0
as an added bonus , scientists at the zoo still have not determined the sex of the baby , making discussion of gender equality pointless			2
it is , in short , the perfect baby for our times			1
there is , of course , that whole @entity141 - @entity110 thing			0
but for now , that will have to wait			0
people here are just happy waiting for their chance to see a hairless , pink , butter - stick baby			2
and hope that uptick in stuffed panda bears bring us out of our national doldrums .			2

he says amid partisan politics and *economic* woes , a baby panda adds a new *perspective*
@entity165 : it is the perfect birth for our imperfect times
