-- @entity5 has arrived back in @entity6 , eight months after she was mistakenly deported to @entity7 , the pilot and a flight attendant on a @entity4 - bound flight told @entity0			1
the 15 - year - old girl was the last person off the plane friday evening , according to @entity0 's @entity10 , who was on the flight			1
@entity4 / @entity12 police officers escorted her off the aircraft			1
@entity5 wound up being deported to @entity14 , @entity7 , in may 2011 after @entity16 authorities last year mistook the girl , an apparent teenage runaway who lacked identification , for a @entity7 national			1
the @entity20 confirmed thursday that @entity5 was then in its custody , is pregnant and entered the country as an adult			1
the institute said that @entity7 authorities learned a month ago that this female may in fact be a 15 - year - old @entity16 citizen , after which she was placed in a protection program there			1
she left @entity7 at 10:30 a.m. friday , according to @entity33 spokesman @entity32 , who noted that the @entity16 @entity34 in @entity14 worked closely with @entity7 officials as well as authorities in @entity6 to bring @entity5 's case to a resolution			1
the girl who called herself @entity40 " it 's a giant step			2
i 'm relieved , but i wo n't be completely relieved until i get her in my arms again , " the girl 's mother said			2
" a weight has definitely been lifted			2
" @entity47 has not yet talked with her daughter , who ran away from home in the fall of 2010 , but said she is relieved to know she is located			0
so , too , is the girl 's grandmother @entity51 , who said @entity34 officials called with the news that her granddaughter would be turned over to @entity16 officials			1
" when i heard those words , i did n't hear nothing else			0
i ca n't wait , " she said			0
after the girl went missing , the family tracked her to @entity61 , where she worked at a music club under a different name			2
they tried to get help from authorities there , to no avail			2
they later learned she was in @entity7 , partying and smoking marijuana , and a detective told them she was pregnant			1
@entity5 's family is still demanding to know why immigration authorities deported the teen -- a @entity16 citizen with no knowledge of @entity77 -- and why they simply took her at her word when she gave them a fake name			1
the family 's attorney , @entity80 , told @entity0 on friday the family believes the girl 's civil rights were violated when authorities allowed her to be deported			1
he said that lawsuits against the agencies who dealt with her case are in the works , he said			0
" somewhere the ball was dropped , " @entity80 said			0
the @entity93 agency maintains she was arrested in @entity61 for theft and told them she was an adult from @entity7			1
the agency says authorities believed her story because she maintained her false identity throughout the process			2
they handed her over to an immigration judge , who ordered her removed from the country			0
" at no time during these criminal proceedings was her identity determined to be false , " the agency says			0
it says criminal database searches and biometric verification revealed no information to invalidate her claims			0
@entity80 says it does n't make sense , explaining that the immigration agency took her fingerprints but failed to match them to the name she gave			0
the agency says it is taking the allegations very seriously and is " fully and immediately investigating the matter in order to expeditiously determine the facts of the case			0
" pictures of the teen taken in @entity7 showed her sitting on men 's laps smoking marijuana , her grandmother said			1
but she appeared to be reaching out for help , she said , listing on @entity136 the names of everyone at parties , perhaps so she could be traced			0
her family 's lawyer says he does n't believe that the girl was trying to fake her way out of the @entity16 by adopting a false identity throughout the process			1
" i do n't buy that she had the wherewithal to be able to bamboozle the government , " @entity80 says			0
" you know , kids are scared when they get around authorities			2
... to think that you could bamboozle them to create a new identity , it just does n't make sense			0
" @entity7 's foreign ministry said thursday it was investigating what sort of verification its consulate in @entity6 requested before giving the girl an expedited provisional passport as part of deportation proceedings , as well as how she got work authorization for training at a call center as part of the government 's " @entity171 " program			1
attorneys with the program made a sworn declaration in front of a notary pointing to " inexact information " that allowed her to receive work papers , the foreign ministry said			0
" those lawyers are no longer providing services to the @entity184 , " the statement said			0
@entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 and @entity189 contributed to this report .			0
