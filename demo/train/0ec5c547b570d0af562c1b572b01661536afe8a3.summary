-- for the first time in @entity3 history , not one program nominated for best drama series was from a major broadcast network			2
yet sunday night 's 64th @entity7 still managed to attract a slightly larger audience than last year			1
@entity10 's telecast delivered 13.2 million viewers , up 6 percent from the 2011 telecast on @entity13			1
among adults 18 - 49 , however , the show declined 10 percent to a 3.8 rating â € ” tying the all - time @entity3 low from back in 2008			1
though creatively hit - and - miss , producers kept the show on schedule , wrapping at three hours ( even if that meant playing off the " @entity24 " team and " @entity23 " winner @entity22 to keep things moving )			0
critics gave high marks to host @entity29 's monologue ( though not his @entity31 - punching cold open bathroom skit )			0
some of the pre-taped sketches , such as re-imagining @entity34 's " @entity33 " as " the @entity35 , " also drew laughs			0
a social media prank where @entity29 encouraged viewers to tweet that @entity39 passed out onstage and tell people to switch on the show seemed to fall flat ( looking at the half - hour ratings throughout the telecast , the gimmick did n't seem to spike viewership , either )			2
on the awards front , many of the winners were very predictable , with @entity10 's " @entity24 " taking home the award for best comedy yet again ( full winners list )			1
but @entity54 's freshman drama " homeland " broke " @entity58 's " four - year winning streak for best drama series , while fellow newcomer , @entity61 's " @entity60 , " lost its bid to capture a top category win by aiming for best movie or miniseries			2
