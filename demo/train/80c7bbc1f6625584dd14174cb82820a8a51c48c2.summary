@entity0 , @entity1 -- everyone thinks i 'm a woman in a man 's world , but to me i 'm just a boxer doing the sport i love			1
it 's been with me since i was a child			1
my dad had videos of all the great fighters -- @entity12 , @entity13			1
i watched them winning their @entity16 medals and world titles and saw those big crowds and thought to myself , " that looks exciting			1
" then one night when i was 12 years old , my mum could n't get a babysitter for me and my brother , so she took us down to the gym with her			0
they had an after - school boxing class , so i joined in and absolutely loved it			1
everybody i met down there became like a little family to me			0
they 'd take me to boxing exhibitions and shows , introduce me to new people and we 'd all just stick together			1
this was so important for my development because it meant i always wanted to be there , i always felt supported and knew that there were people who believed in me			0
you have to remember that being a great boxer is only 50 % physical ; the rest is mental			1
you have to be really confident , calm , relaxed and focused			0
you 've got to get in there thinking " i can win			0
" more from @entity46 : prima ballerina @entity47 my first competitive bout was really fun			0
i remember peering behind the curtain , peeping out and seeing all my friends and family in the crowd waiting for it to begin			0
there were n't many female boxers around at that time , it was very rare , so i just wanted to get in there and perform and show off my skills			1
that 's when i remember thinking , " yeah , i love this sport ! " but it was n't easy to get to where i am now			1
all the training from such a young age has been tough			0
a standard day involves a run in the morning , followed by strength and conditioning exercises -- where i do weights , press ups , pull ups -- and then a boxing session which includes bags , pads , and sparring			1
there are times you have to run through the rain and it 's cold and it 's minus whatever degrees outside , but you just have to get up and you go and do the work			2
and on top of that everything you eat is monitored			0
you ca n't just go out and have a @entity84 's or a pizza when you want , you have to be so strict on yourself			2
there 's no way of finding the motivation for doing it unless you absolutely love the sport			1
you 've got to really love it like nothing else otherwise you wo n't get through the training			2
that 's why i do n't see it as a sacrifice			2
i see it as things i want to do , i choose to do			0
i choose to not go out clubbing and drinking with my friends because i want to be a great boxer			2
but life can get in your way no matter how dedicated you are , no matter how hard you train			0
having hardly sustained any injuries in the ring -- just one broken thumb -- i seriously put my back out in 2009 when i tripped over a bandage hanging out of my bag			1
i got up and did n't feel in too much pain			0
in fact , i even went to a tournament and it was n't until a few weeks later that the pain got worse and worse			0
they took me to the doctors and found a crack in one of my vertebrae -- i was out of boxing for a year			1
i had to have complete bed rest for three to four months			0
it was so difficult because i 'm a get - up - and - go person			0
i like to run around , see what 's going on			2
to be laid in bed , brace put on to keep my spine in line , it was really hard to pick myself up again			0
more from @entity46 : molecular gastronomy chef @entity128 there were moments when i thought i could n't continue , but my friends and family helped me through the hard times , and i just managed to make it back in time for the last assessment camp and make the team			1
it was almost like it was meant to be			0
then came the @entity16 final against @entity139			1
i just remember thinking , whatever she does i 'm going to do 10 times better ; she throws a punch i 'll throw five back			2
she bought out the very best in me in that match			0
the 10 seconds before i was told that i 'd won , i already knew it			0
i could feel it , i was just thinking i ca n't believe that i 've done this ; i ca n't believe i 'm going to be @entity16 champion in front of my home audience			1
winning the medal meant everything ; all the hard work , all the ups and downs , highs and lows , everything in my life has revolved around boxing			2
so for me , winning the gold medal was everything i dreamed about as a kid			2
by putting women 's boxing in the @entity16 , they showed that women can and should be allowed to do any sport they choose			1
it 's all about equality , it 's time for a change .			1
