-- denied a proper buildup to the @entity3 for the second year in a row , @entity1 has taken out her injury frustrations on some of the host country 's most promising young male tennis players			1
the planet 's highest - paid female athlete will line up in @entity11 for the 10th time next week , confident she has overcome the neck problem that ruled her out of the @entity14 earlier this month			1
the world no. 2 , who was hampered by an ankle injury before going on to lose last year 's final , will play 105th - ranked fellow @entity19 @entity18 in her opening match			1
" i would have loved to come in with a few matches , but sometimes circumstances do n't allow that , " she told reporters on saturday , having earlier presented the global launch of her new candy line " @entity25			2
" " to me i 'd rather be going on to the court knowing that i 'm healthy			0
yes , i might be a little bit rusty , but i 'll work my way through it			0
i 'm experienced enough to know the adjustments i have to make in those types of circumstances			0
i certainly would have loved to step on court and play those matches			0
" instead the 25 - year - old , who won the season 's opening grand slam in 2008 , got into shape with matches against male opposition			2

it has n't been done since the ' 80s , " said @entity62 , who will start against 106th - ranked @entity84 @entity83 in top form following her title in @entity35			1
" i do n't know if i can do it			0
" @entity63 pulled out of her @entity35 semi against @entity62 after needing toe surgery to fix a botched pedicure , but she is hoping to build on the self - belief she gained from winning her maiden grand slam 12 months ago			1
" it definitely helped to bring a lot of inner confidence in myself , knowing that i can do it , " said the 23 - year - old , who will play 54th - ranked @entity84 @entity98			0
" that feeling that i had was incredible			0
since then , i want to feel it again			0
