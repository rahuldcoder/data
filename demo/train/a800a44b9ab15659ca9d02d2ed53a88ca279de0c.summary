-- " do n't close your eyes , do n't close your eyes , " a terrified @entity4 chanted as he coasted 7,000 feet above @entity5 , @entity6 , his heart racing			0
one by one , @entity4 watched as three people were " sucked " out of the plane and whipped violently into the thrashing winds and mist			0
" just put your head back and breathe , " he told himself , seconds before joining the others			0
but why would someone with a severe fear of heights willingly plummet from the sky ? to cross " skydiving " off his mental bucket list , of course			1
@entity4 was inspired to dream up his list of goals after watching @entity24 's " @entity23 " , a reality tv show about four friends who set out to accomplish the tasks on their joint bucket list			1
the show , which wrapped its first season in march , has motivated many young adults to create such lists right now , rather than waiting until they 're about to " kick the bucket " like @entity33 and @entity35 's terminally ill characters in " @entity36 " or queen @entity38 's supposedly terminally ill character in " @entity39			1
" @entity4 said he tuned in every week , but he knew he wanted to live his own version of " @entity23 " five minutes in to the first episode			1
" if you had one day to live , what would you do ? " a voice asks viewers during the show 's opening credits			2
" would you climb a mountain ? would you kiss the girl of your dreams ? would you tell someone how you feel ? now , if you had a whole lifetime to live , would you lose that drive , or would your list just keep getting longer ? " " [ the guys on the show ] inspired me and they pushed me to [ go skydiving ] , " he said			1
" to see them go out with no fear and do the things they wanted to do -- it made me want to do those things , too			0
" the show 's title was inspired by a 19th century @entity67 poem by the same name			2
the stars on the show -- @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74 -- decided " @entity23 " summed up their concerns about getting bogged down with daily routine and losing their passion for life			1
" what do you want to do before you die ? " became the premise for their new lifestyle and , eventually , the @entity24 series that allowed them to cross number 53 off their bucket list : " make a badass tv show			1
" that list is under their control			2
" what they do and how they do it and who they contact and help -- that 's their decision , " said @entity92 , a senior vice president at @entity24 , who first realized the project 's potential when he saw footage of the guys sneaking into the @entity98 to walk the red carpet			1
rather than arresting them , we gave them a tv show , @entity92 joked			2
others like the guys ' ideas			0
" the more i watch ' @entity23 ' and the more i 've seen them experience things , the more i 've wanted to do it , " @entity115 said			1
the 18 - year - old @entity119 student said she appreciates what the guys stand for			0
in 2008 , @entity123 's friend died about three days after being diagnosed with an infection			0
the loss prompted @entity123 and her friends to create a bucket list made up of kind gestures , long - term goals , personal achievements and travel destinations			1
some of the items , like pay for someone 's groceries and adopt a dog from a shelter , were crossed off rather quickly , she said			0
but goals like start a flash mob , travel to @entity141 -- from where @entity123 and her sister were adopted -- and overcome her crippling stage fright , will be more difficult to accomplish			1
" if they can take part in a @entity150 [ dance ] competition , i think i can get up and say a few lines in front of people , " she said			0
" they 've really helped me and they do n't even know it			0
" one of @entity123 's favorite aspects of the show is that every time the cast members cross something off their bucket list , they help a stranger accomplish one of his or her own goals			1
for example , in the series finale , the guys help a young man who was adopted at birth find his biological father			2
because @entity123 was adopted , the episode meant a lot to her , she said			0
" you can actually care about people and still be cool , " @entity123 said			0
" [ it 's ] a good trend to have caught on			0
" just one bucket list was n't enough for 21 - year - old @entity179			1
the @entity181 student wrote two -- one for specific goals he wanted to accomplish during 2010 and one for long - term goals			2
like @entity123 , @entity179 was inspired to write a bucket list after his friend died suddenly in a motorcycle accident last summer			1
" it opened up my eyes , " he said			0
" life is kind of short			2
" though @entity179 has n't yet found the time to be someone 's hero , save someone 's life or race @entity198 's legendary @entity197 track , just writing the lists is an accomplishment , he said			2
" a lot of these things , like taking more pictures and visiting old friends , are n't going to be difficult , " @entity179 said			0
" they 're just going to improve me as a person and make me appreciate life more and really enjoy it to the max. " @entity210 , who has never seen the tv series , came across the bucket list concept while surfing the internet in 2009			1
the 25 - year - old from @entity215 eventually decided to write her own bucket list , which she shares with the public on her web site as a reminder to " live every moment to the fullest when you 're in good health			1
" despite already opening her own school for personal development in @entity215 and starting an online talk show , @entity210 said she thinks no. 14 , " experience true love , " will be the most challenging goal to accomplish			2
" you might think [ a bucket list is ] just a list of goals , but if you 're really thinking about things you want to see , experience and feel before you die , then the whole concept of setting goals is totally different , " @entity210 said			1
" when we start thinking about what we want to do before we die , our goals become totally different			2
fall in love , see the empire state building			0
that 's the magic of the bucket list -- it removes limits			1
that 's why he 's not ending his " buried life " with skydiving , which he said he would do again in a heartbeat , by the way			0
bungee jumping and riding a bull are next			0
" i 'm hooked , " he said .			0
