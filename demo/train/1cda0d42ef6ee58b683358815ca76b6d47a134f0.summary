-- my name is @entity3 and i 'm a 9 - year - old boy who likes @entity5 ! a lot ! when i was 1 month old i started having seizures , and when i was 4 years old i went to dr. @entity8 and he gave me brain surgery to stop my seizures			1
it stopped my seizures for two years but not my appetite , it just kept on growing ! it is still growing			0
after two years my seizures came back and now they are longer			0
when was little i had like 15 small seizures a day			0
now i have 10 - minute seizures but i only have one every 14 days or so			0
one is dinky and the other is @entity18			1
@entity19 is our family dog and he really belongs to my sister , @entity22			2
@entity18 is my seizure dog			1
getting @entity18 took a long time			1
we had to raise a lot of money and wait almost a year to meet her and then we had to drive from @entity27 to @entity28 to get @entity18			1
having @entity18 is very fun ! when i first got @entity18 it was pretty hard because she did n't listen to me , but now she does and she knows a lot of commands			2
i 've even taught her some new things , like climbing up into the fort section of my swing set			0
the best thing about having @entity18 is playing with her and i love racing with her			2
if she is on her leash she runs right next to me but i know she can run really fast			0
i have epilepsy but i can do some extraordinary things like ride a zip line ! epilepsy can also be bad , though , and i 've heard about some seizures that can kill you ! sometimes i worry that will happen to me but i do n't think about that too much , plus i have @entity18 to help me			1
@entity18 barks when i have a seizure so my parents will know			1
when i have a seizure , my mom and dad give me medicine to help stop the seizure			2
people ask me a lot what it feels like but it 's hard to describe and sometimes i do n't remember having a seizure			0
if i met someone who just found out they have epilepsy i 'd say , " do n't worry , you 're not in this alone ! "			0

@entity3 wrote a book to raise funds for a seizure dog
getting the dog , @entity18 , " took a long time , " he says
