-- @entity2 sen. @entity1 felt sick after reading it			0
the @entity4 says it is " irrelevant " to @entity6 's proposal for @entity7 to hand over chemical weapons			1
certainly , @entity6 president @entity10 's direct appeal to the @entity12 people over the @entity7 crisis has prompted a flurry of commentary in response			1
but do his claims stack up ? we take a look at some of the most contentious claims in @entity10 's @entity23 opinion piece			2
from the outset , @entity6 has advocated peaceful dialogue enabling @entity7 to develop a compromise plan for their own future			1
@entity6 has continued to supply the @entity29 regime with military hardware including attack helicopters , air defense systems , and military advisers			1
no one doubts that poison gas was used in @entity7			1
but there is every reason to believe it was used not by the @entity7 army but by opposition forces to provoke intervention by their powerful foreign patrons , who would be siding with the fundamentalists			1
not according to the @entity12 , @entity44 and others who claim the evidence is clear that @entity48 's forces were behind the attack			1
" we assess that the scenario in which the opposition executed the attack on august 21 is highly unlikely , " a @entity4 statement said			2
" the body of information used to make this assessment includes intelligence pertaining to the regime 's preparations for this attack and its means of delivery , multiple streams of intelligence about the attack itself and its effect , our post-attack observations , and the differences between the capabilities of the regime and the opposition			2
" @entity44 agrees , with prime minister @entity77 saying last week that there was " further " evidence that @entity29 's forces used chemical weapons , after research by the @entity44 military laboratories in @entity76 suggested that traces of sarin gas in the soil and on clothing taken from a patient who was treated near an alleged attack were unlikely to have been faked			1
millions around the world increasingly see @entity12 not as a model of democracy but as relying solely on brute force			2
@entity10 's condemnation of brute force sits uneasily with @entity95 's own track record of force during a conflict with @entity99 separatists that claimed tens of thousands of lives , many of them civilians			0
in 1999 , @entity10 took to the @entity23 opinion page to defend @entity6 action in @entity104 , arguing that " decisive armed intervention was the only way to prevent further casualties both within and far outside the borders of @entity104			1
" and @entity109 wo n't have forgotten @entity6 's invasion of their country five years ago last month , when @entity10 served as prime minister			2
my working and personal relationship with president @entity116 is marked by growing trust			0
remember @entity118 ? @entity116 took office pledging a " reset " in ties with @entity95			0
but the famously awkward body language at the @entity123 in june was for many a sign of how that has gone			0
that was even before the former @entity128 contractor was granted asylum in @entity6 , despite @entity12 requests that he be extradited			1
and back in 2011 , @entity10 accused @entity116 's then - secretary of state , @entity132 , of encouraging opposition protests after parliamentary elections that december			0
time for another reset ? we are all different , but when we ask for the @entity138 's blessings , we must not forget that @entity139 created us equal			0
@entity6 's gay community might not be feeling very equal right now			0
a vaguely worded anti-gay propaganda law was passed overwhelmingly in @entity142 this year and signed into law by @entity10			0
the law bans public discussion of gay rights and relationships anywhere children might hear it			0
those found in breach of it can be fined , or deported if they are foreigners			0
it is extremely dangerous to encourage people to see themselves as exceptional , whatever the motivation			0
so " unique " is ok , then ? the @entity157 reported last year on a strategy document produced by a @entity160 commission that argued , " thanks to the unifying role of the @entity6 people ... a unique sociocultural civilisational community on the historical territory of the @entity6 state has formed : the multinational @entity6 nation			1

@entity6 president makes appeal to @entity12 people in @entity23
he says poison gas was probably used by opposition , not @entity7 army
but @entity12 , @entity44 say evidence is clear that @entity180 forces were behind attack
@entity6 has itself referred to uniqueness of the @entity6 nation
