-- the simple answer to the question why @entity3 is headed to @entity4 , in the first papal trip to @entity6 in 25 years , is straightforward			1
the pope is going to celebrate the sixth @entity8 and beatify 124 martyrs of @entity4			1
but the more complex answer has to take into consideration the @entity13 's unique history and the pope 's theological agenda			2
these can give us a deeper understanding of why he is making this trip			2
while @entity4 may not be viewed as an overtly @entity22 nation ( compared to the @entity23 , the most @entity24 nation in @entity6 ) , at least 10 % of @entity4 's population belong to the @entity13 , according to its statistics			1
the @entity13 in @entity4 enjoys a high level of respect from non-catholics , maintains good relations with other religious communities , and has a history of positive social engagement for the common good			1
pope @entity3 's visit will recognize these accomplishments , a move that will not only please @entity38 , but hold up their church as a model of evangelization			2
evangelizing in @entity6 since it is @entity6 that has the greatest potential for the growth of @entity45 , it makes sense to highlight an @entity6 success story and to recognize the @entity6 youth who will be called on to continue that growth			1
@entity50 is in fact a key concern for @entity3			0
his apostolic exhortation , @entity54 , focused on this topic and called for the transformation of the @entity13 to focus on " the evangelization of today 's world rather than for her self - preservation			0
" the pope 's concept of evangelization does not focus simply on baptizing new @entity64 , but , as seen in the chapter from that exhortation entitled " the @entity67 of @entity50 , " also includes a call for the inclusion of the " homeless , the addicted , refugees , indigenous peoples , [ and ] the elderly who are increasingly isolated and abandoned			0
" moreover , this pope , while recognizing the importance of ordained clergy , decried " clericalism " before the publication of this exhortation , sees the laity as having an active role in evangelization			0
the pope 's concerns as expressed in @entity83 therefore resonate with the historical accomplishments of the @entity85 in that it has grown into a relatively large and healthy @entity22 community with much of the work of evangelization being conducted by the laity			0
it is no accident that during his trip the pope will visit @entity92 ( @entity93 ) , a @entity22 institution devoted to caring for such marginalized groups as the elderly and the homeless , where he will meet with leaders of the @entity98 of the @entity99			0
origins of @entity85 the @entity85 began with the baptism of a @entity103 scholar named @entity104 in @entity105 in 1784 , who had developed an interest in @entity45 after reading @entity108 books on the religion			1
after his baptism , @entity104 returned to @entity4 and began baptizing others , so that there were already 4,000 @entity64 there before a missionary -- a @entity108 priest named father @entity116 , himself one of the martyrs to be beatified -- arrived in 1794			1
the @entity103 state could not tolerate the existence of a foreign religion whose members recognized a deity outside government control and persecuted the new church			0
catholics were given the choice of giving up their religion or being sentenced to death , with several thousands choosing the latter and becoming martyrs			2
despite these persecutions , the church managed to survive and rebuild itself multiple times			0
while foreign missionaries played an important role , much of the work of maintaining the community and spreading the faith was carried out by the laity			0
the coming of religious tolerance in the late 19th century led to an increase in the number of @entity64 , but it was not until the 1960s that the @entity13 in @entity4 began to grow quickly			1
while that growth has slowed down in recent years , the church is quite healthy , with its approximately five million members , according to the church			2
at the same time , it must be stressed that the @entity85 faces challenges			0
growth has declined , and many newly baptized @entity64 leave the faith or become lukewarm			2
likewise , @entity103 society has many of the difficulties post-industrial societies in the @entity161 face , such as the " unbridled consumerism " the pope decried in his apostolic exhortation			0
it is here that one can see the importance of the martyrs who the pope will beatify			1
in their stories , one sees @entity64 giving up wealth , sex , and even life itself out of their love for others and for @entity174			0
the pope will no doubt highlight how their devotion to the faith led to the growth and development of the @entity179 in @entity4 , allowing him to echo the themes found in his exhortation			1
the fact that he will beatify these martyrs in @entity4 the day after @entity38 celebrate their independence from @entity185 , will not be missed by @entity38			1
the pope likely hopes that this recognition , and the teaching opportunity it provides , will renew evangelization in @entity4 , and through it , the world .			1

@entity191 is to celebrate sixth @entity8 and beatify 124 martyrs of @entity4
@entity6 that has the greatest potential for the growth of @entity45
@entity45 has history of surviving persecution
