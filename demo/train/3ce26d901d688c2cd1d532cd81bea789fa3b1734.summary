@entity2 gov. @entity1 's decision to send up to 1,000 @entity4 troops to the southern border is the latest move in a controversy over the influx of migrant youths from @entity10 , many unaccompanied , streaming into the @entity11			1
it represents concrete action over concerns raised by @entity1 and other @entity15 that border security be given more resources generally and specifically in this case to deal with what most agree is a humanitarian crisis			1
the @entity21 , which has declined to approve federal authorization of the @entity4 in response to the immigration situation that has flared this year , panned @entity1 's idea as shortsighted and politically motivated			1
here are the questions we wanted to know about @entity1 's plan			1
why did @entity1 call on the guard ? @entity1 said those troops are needed to " combat " crime because the border patrol is busy dealing with the flow of immigrant kids crossing the border from @entity37			1
the @entity4 will be a " force multiplier " to aid state law enforcement to reduce crime from cartels , traffickers and criminals crossing the border , @entity1 said			1
but is n't this a crisis about kids ? @entity1 said the border patrol is consumed with handling the influx of migrant children and partial family units , who can not be deported but must be humanely treated and cared for according to @entity11 law			1
if unaccompanied children approach the troops , however , @entity2 adjutant general @entity52 , who is head of the @entity53 , said they will " get on the phone " to a border station so that the children will receive water and medical care			1
how does that stop the influx ? @entity1 does n't say that it will			2
he said he wants to stop border crime			0
so what will the border patrol do ? the @entity4 troops will " refer " suspected criminal activity to the @entity2 @entity69			1
they will also patrol the border by air , especially at night			2
and they will amass at the border to provide a strong visual that @entity1 hopes will " deter " criminals from bringing illicit activity across the border			2
what wo n't they do ? the @entity4 will not make arrests			2
" if we were asked to , we could detain people , but we 're not planning to , " @entity81 said			0
how much will it cost and who will pay for it ? @entity2 taxpayers are on the hook , and it will cost about $ 12 million per month			1
will it work ? the former head of the @entity4 and a former commissioner of the @entity94 bureau have said @entity1 's plan is limited in scope			1
" the real solution to basically helping border patrol is going to be a holistic approach to this that goes way beyond more boots on the ground , " said @entity97 , the acting commissioner of @entity94 from 2011 until 2013			1
@entity97 said one thing that will help relieve the workload of border patrol agents is to relieve @entity94 from being the sole government agency to process and care for the unaccompanied youth in the immediate aftermath of their detention			1
the former chief of the @entity4 echoed @entity97 's sentiment			0
" that measure alone will not solve the current problem			0
it is far more complex and it requires a unity approach that incorporates state , local and federal resources , " said retired lt. gen. @entity117			0
when will this take place and for how long ? the troops will be immediately deployed over the next 30 days , according to @entity81			0
how long they will remain is unknown			0
@entity1 is asking the federal government to hire and train an additional 3,000 border patrol agents to replace the @entity4			1
that part of the plan is up to @entity129 and the comprehensive immigration plan which would have provided more resources for border security is stalled in the @entity21 , and neither body has yet unveiled how they would solve the current border crisis			0
is politics playing a role ? @entity1 is considering another presidential run in 2016			0
he previewed his @entity4 plan in @entity140 , a key presidential nominating state , over the weekend and announced it the next day			1
@entity1 has some reconciling to do within a @entity15 that has used the current border crisis to move to the right on the issue			2
@entity146 political analyst and @entity148 editorial director @entity145 said that @entity1 's focus on border security " allows him to shore up his tough on security bona fides " in what has become " a big moment for the @entity15 " on immigration			2
has the @entity4 been sent to the border before ? yes			2
the @entity4 is already on the border but in smaller numbers			2
a recent and much larger instance was @entity159 , a two - year deployment that began in 2006 to stem the more than 1 million people who were caught crossing the border each year			0
what is the situation on the border ? the @entity167 sector , where most of the immigrant children are turning themselves into the border patrol , currently has 3,000 border patrol agents covering 320 miles of land and 250 miles of water , which equates to 5.4 agents per mile			1
the @entity176 sector , for instance , has approximately 15.7 agents per mile			0
while the number of unaccompanied youth crossing the border has doubled to nearly 60,000 in the past year , the total number of immigrant crossings has mostly declined			0
about 1 million people have been caught crossing the border nearly every year between 1983 until 2006 , but that number has dropped to about 400,000 in 2013			0
at the same time , resources for border security have steadily increased : more than 18,000 agents patrolled the border in 2013 compared to 10,000 a decade ago			0
and the amount spent on border security has more than doubled			0
the @entity94 and @entity193 budget jumped from $ 5 billion in 2002 to $ 12.4 billion this year			0

@entity2 gov. @entity1 is deploying @entity4 troops to the border
former heads of border patrol and the @entity4 say the plan will have limited *impact*
the plan is expected to cost @entity2 taxpayers $ 12 million per month
