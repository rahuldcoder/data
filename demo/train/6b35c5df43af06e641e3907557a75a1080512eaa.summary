president @entity0 arrived in @entity1 on wednesday for the first part of his @entity4 trip that started with reassuring @entity5 of @entity7 support in its bitter territorial dispute with @entity9			1
@entity0 made his first stop in @entity5 on a weeklong tour that will also take him to @entity12 , @entity13 and the @entity14			0
@entity0 and @entity1 prime minister @entity15 met over what 's been described as the " world 's best sushi " at @entity19 , a top - rated restaurant in the @entity22 district			1
the dinner also brought out the new @entity7 ambassador to @entity1 , @entity24			2
on thursday , @entity0 will start a formal state visit to the nation -- the highest designation for a foreign leader			0
@entity0 's appearances in @entity1 will be tinged with formality â€” meetings with the royal family , a stop at the @entity34 and a protocol - bound state dinner			1
@entity1 's first state visit by an @entity7 president in almost two decades comes as the @entity7 works to reassure @entity15 and other @entity4 leaders that the @entity7 remains committed to turning foreign policy focus on them			1
the " pivot to @entity4 " that began almost three years ago meant to put a greater emphasis on diplomatic and economic efforts toward @entity44 nations to counterbalance @entity9 's influence in the region			2
@entity0 begins @entity4 trip with ' the best sushi i 've ever had ' but @entity57 uprisings , the @entity53 civil war and new diplomacy with @entity55 have made some @entity4 leaders wonder when the " pivot " would take shape			2
at the start of his long - awaited visit , @entity0 waded into a fraught territorial dispute between @entity1 and @entity9			1
he told a @entity1 newspaper that a group of uninhabited islands in the @entity66 claimed by both @entity5 and @entity67 " fall within the scope " of a @entity7 - @entity1 security treaty , implying the @entity7 could step in militarily in the event of a clash over the territory			1
it 's the first time an incumbent @entity7 president has made such a statement on the bitterly disputed islands , and comes as @entity4 nations nervously watch the @entity7 response to @entity80 's incursion into @entity81			1
@entity1 has eyed the @entity81 situation closely			0
@entity0 's comments wednesday should dispel at least some of its worry			0
" we oppose any unilateral attempts to undermine @entity1 's administration of these islands , " @entity0 said in answers to questions submitted by the @entity88			1
both @entity5 and @entity67 say the islands , known as @entity94 in @entity1 and @entity94 in @entity9 , are an inherent part of their territory			1
@entity97 , which lies 120 miles ( about 190 kilometers ) southwest of the islands , also stakes a claim to them			0
@entity0 's words , reiterating statements made in previous years by former secretary of state @entity102 , drew a swift rebuke from @entity67			0
" the @entity7 should respect the truth , not take any sides , be careful about its words and behavior , and uphold peace and stability , " said @entity105 , a spokesman for the @entity106			2
but @entity0 's comments are likely to provide some reassurance to @entity1			1
the @entity9 government has stepped up efforts in recent years to challenge @entity1 's control of the small , rocky islands and the waters and airspace around them			1
@entity0 's efforts to reassure @entity4 allies also extend to his push for the @entity125 , a massive trade deal the @entity128 hopes will open economic channels in the region			2
in the works for years , the @entity1 portion of the trade deal is not expected to be finalized this week -- due to disagreements between the @entity7 and @entity1 , and a delay in @entity135 from members of @entity0 's party			1
the resistance to approving the trade deal , along with another trade pact being negotiated with @entity140 , stems from @entity142 ' worry the agreements would kill jobs			0
they 're not likely to come on board at least until november 's midterm elections			0
" the president has developed credibility problems in terms of delivering on the congressional support , " said @entity148 , who handled @entity4 policy in @entity150 's @entity128 and now acts as a senior fellow at @entity152			0
" my own sense is ... that there 's less confidence that the president has ( been ) effective in dealing with the @entity135 and that may really be a major issue in finalizing ( the trade deal )			0
" despite the stalemate , @entity7 officials have remained bullish the deal would be good for the @entity7 economy			0
" this remains a very important aspect of our rebalance to the @entity172 , one that holds great promise for the countries in the region as well as for the @entity7 , " @entity0 's national security adviser , @entity168 , said last week			2
" we 'll continue to work toward that given its significance to all concerned			0
" @entity180 rivals @entity9 and @entity1 deploy @entity182 villain in latest spat			0

president @entity0 says a set of disputed islands fall under a @entity7 - @entity1 treaty
he makes the comments to @entity1 paper *ahead* of a visit to @entity4
@entity9 disputes his assertion , saying the @entity7 should " respect the truth "
