-- well , look at that			0
the boys at @entity3 finally came into the 20th century , only 12 years after the millennium			1
with the admission of @entity7 and businesswoman @entity8 into their previously male - only club , one more gender barrier has been cracked			2
but it remains to be seen whether it has been truly broken			0
@entity3 was forced to open to black men way back in 1990 , when a controversy erupted at the @entity15 in @entity16			1
the club was all white , and @entity19 tour sponsors balked			2
so the @entity19 changed the rules -- meaning clubs that discriminated on the basis of race or gender would no longer be allowed to host a tournament			0
some -- like @entity15 -- changed their policies and opened the membership			0
others said " no thanks , " valuing their right to discriminate above hosting a tournament			0
but there was one exception -- @entity3			1
it did open to black men " after being pistol - whipped behind closed doors , " according to one major golf writer who was around at the time			2
but it drew the line on the girls			0
that 's why the @entity44 has n't been an " official " @entity46 event since then , even though the results count , and everybody knows the @entity19 is officially ignoring its own policies and looking the other way			0
when the @entity52 asked the club in a polite letter in 2002 to reconsider its stand against women , then - chairman @entity51 went ballistic			1
it became a national argument over where women ought to be allowed to go , and who had the right to openly and proudly discriminate			2
and when @entity52 made the membership roster public for the first time since the club was formed , it became clear that while race discrimination was viewed by the @entity68 who made up the membership as a no - no , they saw nothing wrong with sex discrimination			2
they cowered behind their mahogany desks and refused to make a statement -- never mind resign from the club			2
@entity78 , the major sponsor of the masters , even had a representative call me as chairwoman of @entity52 and bawl me out for making a fuss			0
celebration , surprise , humor after @entity3 admits first women confined to a muddy field far from the gates , the protest we staged in 2003 was widely reported as a failure			1
but time and persistence have proved that version wrong			0
had the women 's groups backed down then , we would n't be celebrating the admission of @entity99 and @entity8 now			2
had we not changed the conversation about sex discrimination and kept it front and center every year at tournament time -- while behind the scenes facilitating $ 80 million in legal settlements on behalf of women working at companies whose @entity104 were club members -- the issue would have quietly died away			1
while no one save the club leadership is privy to the decision - making , it 's long past due , and the exact process does n't matter			0
what does matter is that the women 's movement once again succeeded			0
and of course after enduring taunts , insults , and even death threats , which have never stopped over the past 10 years , my personal feelings are tremendous relief and vindication			1
but that 's tempered with concern			0
the challenge now moves to the @entity104 of those corporations who so stubbornly hung together 10 years ago and now say it 's a joyous occasion to welcome women to the golf club			1
will @entity8 and @entity99 be marginalized and tokenized , like the two or three black men who were admitted after @entity15 ? or will the members step up to the plate and get a real plan for reaching parity ? @entity3 no longer just a ' boys club ' and a far more important club these same guys belong to is the business world at large			1
do they welcome women into their boardrooms and the highest ranks of their companies ? not yet			1
women make up only 16 % of @entity68 board members and not even 5 % of @entity104			1
our research in 2005 showed that through interlocking business relationships and corporate board seats , the members of @entity3 reach into over 1,300 companies and major charities			1
that 's a hell of a lot of influence			0
let 's hope they use it right before the turn of another century			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity164 .			1

for 10 years , @entity164 and others fought to get @entity3 golf club to accept women
@entity164 : through decade of protests , taunts , @entity104 have fought *bitterly* to *ban* women
she says the more important club is the corporate boardroom , where women are scarce
@entity164 is relieved , but now the *struggle* is to get women into the top ranks of businesses
