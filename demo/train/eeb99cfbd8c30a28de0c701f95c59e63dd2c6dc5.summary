-- @entity2 manager @entity1 says he and his slumping team are " desperate " to turn things around -- and hopes the reversal of fortune begins in the @entity7			1
the defending @entity9 champion did n't lose any ground in the title race -- although repeating was already looking unlikely -- but the @entity12 did slip 12 points behind a @entity7 spot after the most recent round of games last weekend			1
and @entity2 was n't just beaten on sunday			2
it was outclassed by arch - rival @entity17 at @entity19 , 3 - 0			1
while @entity17 routinely threatened thanks to the likes of in - form pair @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity2 's high - profile duo of @entity22 and @entity23 were never a problem for the @entity28 ' sometimes shaky defense			1
with @entity17 controlling the midfield , @entity2 struggled to gain a foothold and managed just one shot on target			1
" the players are capable of turning it around , " @entity1 was quoted as saying by @entity2 's website			1
" we 're all desperate to put things right and make sure we play better to give the supporters here something to shout about			2
" the manner of the defeat piled more pressure on @entity1 , who is in his first season at the helm at @entity2 after replacing managerial great @entity45			2
former @entity17 defender @entity46 said @entity1 is " fighting for his future " and that if @entity2 exited the @entity7 against @entity51 and then lost to @entity52 in the league , " there will be serious doubts over whether @entity1 can continue			1
" according to @entity56 bookmaker @entity54 , @entity1 is the joint third favorite -- behind @entity59 's @entity58 and @entity61 's @entity60 -- to become the next @entity9 manager to depart			2
@entity59 and @entity61 are struggling near the relegation zone although @entity59 won saturday at @entity64			0
@entity2 faces an uphill battle to reach the last eight of this season 's @entity7 after a 2 - 0 reverse in @entity69 : only once has the team lost a first leg in the competition and advanced -- in 2006/2007 against @entity73			1
but @entity51 has lost all 11 of its previous encounters in @entity75 and @entity2 has won all of its home games versus @entity69 opposition			1
given @entity2 's position in the @entity9 , winning the @entity7 might be its most feasible path to appearing in next season 's competition			1
@entity2 last failed to compete in the @entity7 in 1995/1996			2
" we have to go for the throat to get the win , " said @entity1			0
" we wo n't be gung - ho but we will certainly go with a mindset to overhaul the deficit as quickly as we can			0
" we wo n't be reckless as we could find ourselves with a bigger mountain to climb but we can be forceful			0
we have to be if we 're to keep ourselves in the @entity7			0
" @entity2 midfielder @entity90 , bought in the january transfer window for a club record $ 61 million , said @entity2 's pedigree in @entity94 -- it has amassed three titles in @entity94 's top club competition while @entity51 has yet to make the semifinals -- could be a factor			1
" everything went bad ( against @entity17 ) , " @entity90 wrote in his blog			0
" it was a tough defeat and i want to tell you that we will give everything we have in order to forget about this in the remaining games			0
and there is a very important one around the corner			0
" we know the history of this club and its achievements , based on a winning spirit			0
that is what we need to beat @entity51 and get through in the @entity7			2
" the storm will pass and the sun will rise again , " the cup - tied @entity114 also said			0
" i have no doubt			0
besides , no one said this would be easy			0

@entity1 says his slumping team is " desperate " to turn things around
@entity2 's loss to @entity17 leaves the club 12 points behind a @entity7 spot
@entity2 must also overturn a 2 - 0 deficit against @entity51 to advance in @entity94
@entity2 has never lost a home game to @entity69 opposition in the @entity7
