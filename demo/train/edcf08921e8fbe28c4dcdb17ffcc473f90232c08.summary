@entity0 -- when the worlds of federal bureaucracies and public schools collide , what results is often a teaching moment for all involved			1
the @entity8 administration has unleashed two @entity10 departments to get tough on teachers and other school personnel who -- through so - called " zero tolerance " policies -- often refer disciplinary cases to police			1
what concerns folks at the @entity20 departments is that african - american and @entity23 students might be singled out for suspension and other forms of discipline , in ways that could amount to outright racial and ethnic discrimination			1
their proposed solution is called the @entity31 , which seeks to limit student suspensions and expulsions and provide " alternative best practices such as restorative justice , peer mediation and positive behavioral supports			2
" the initiative was unveiled in 2011			2
but last week , the administration went so far as to lay out specific guidelines for states and even individual school districts			1
the administration will propose $ 50 million in grants to more than 1,000 schools to train teachers and staff in strategies aimed at improving student behavior and improving the climate of schools			1
upon hearing all this , memory takes me back to a junior high school in a small , largely @entity57 and @entity57 - @entity58 farming town in @entity59 , where i found myself , in the years after college , trying to support my writing habit by working as a substitute teacher			1
i had a long - term assignment , about three months , teaching a " special education " course that was being misused as a dumping ground for rowdy and disruptive kids with behavioral problems			2
almost all the kids in the class were @entity71			2
the regular teacher , a 60 - something woman with a kind disposition and white hair , was in poor health and on a prolonged absence			2
one day , i was looking for a lesson plan in the teacher 's desk and ran across some diary - like notes that the teacher had written -- probably in case she needed them someday			0
her problem kid was an angry 13 - year - old @entity71 young man named " @entity85			0
" they apparently had a running conflict , and , one day , the teacher had scribbled down in her notes : " @entity85 called me a white @ # $ % & , and said he was going to hurt me			0
" welcome to the real world of public schools in @entity92 , which bears no resemblance to what they teach you at schools of education or university - run teacher credentialing programs			1
when students such as @entity85 act up or get out of line , they have to be disciplined			0
they have to get in trouble , pay a price and be taught that they simply ca n't go through life disrupting their environment and threatening authority figures			2
we can debate what the punishment should be , but there have to be consequences			0
no " if 's , " " and 's " or " but 's			0
" it 's for his own good			0
let 's say you give him a pass			0
what 's going to happen the first time he 's on the street and mouths off to a cop ? also , note the part about how @entity85 allegedly called this nice , elderly woman " a white @ # $ % &			0
" from my experience , that 's also very common			0
we 'll hear advocates for students talk about how teachers sometimes harbor prejudices against students , and there is no doubt that this is true			2
but we do n't hear much about what happens when the shoe is on the other foot			0
go into any inner - city high school in @entity92 , and you 'll hear @entity58 and @entity71 students using racial slurs when talking about teachers and administrators			1
it goes with the territory			0
this is n't to say that there is n't any discrimination in the doling out of school discipline , or that this is n't a subject worthy of more study			1
they might well be , and it certainly is			0
yet , this initiative could also backfire on the administration by micromanaging our schools , undermining the authority of teachers and teaching @entity58 and @entity23 students to see themselves as victims			1
besides , throwing two @entity10 departments at the problem is a serious case of overkill			1
how is this for a new approach ? if we really want to help students who get in trouble , why do n't we stop meddling in the schools and start dealing with those societal factors -- such as poverty , despair and broken homes -- that help these young people get into trouble in the first place ? the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity188 .			1

@entity188 : @entity8 administration has targeted " zero tolerance policies "
he says there is *evidence* that school discipline is meted out in discriminatory way
putting two @entity10 departments on the issue is overkill , @entity188 says
@entity188 : micromanaging our schools is a risk and could erode authority of teachers
