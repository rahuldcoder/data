@entity1 , @entity0 -- @entity3 is sure of the quality most necessary to create a successful team : mutual respect			1
zidane : the ex-footballer identifies mutual respect as the most important quality that players need to exhibit within a team			1
it is a telling observation from a man whose incredible achievements on the football pitch were only slightly marred by explosions of rage that often seemed to be provoked by a perceived lack of respect from others			2
" when you have 23 players ( in a football team 's squad ) , everyone has their personality , one is stronger , one more shy , one more reserved , one more arrogant , " he tells @entity2			0
" but the most important is respect between all of us			2
" the @entity34 maestro , who hung up his boots two years ago , certainly enjoyed the respect of his teammates			1
former coaches and fellow players speak in reverent tones about him			0
in large part , this is due to his sublime talent -- few would argue with the summation that he was the most gifted footballer of his generation			2
yet this immense ability was accompanied by a shyness and humility notoriously absent among many of today 's top sportsmen , and by an intense professionalism that bordered on obsession			0
@entity57 , the coach of the @entity34 national team that @entity3 guided to victory in the 1998 thanks to two headed goals in the final against @entity64 , says the player was gifted with " an internal vision			1
" " he can make the ball do whatever he wants			0
but it is his drive which takes him forward			0
he is 100 per cent football , " he told the @entity72 newspaper @entity71			0
it was this dedication that allowed the @entity34 - born son of @entity77 immigrants to escape his tough upbringing in a deprived suburb of @entity80 and make it on the big stage			1
starting out as a 17 - year - old for @entity34 side @entity84 , @entity3 went on to play for @entity86 , the @entity87 team @entity88 and finished his career at a @entity91 side packed with many of the world 's top talent			1
under the tenure of president @entity97 the club made a host of big - name transfers including @entity102 international @entity100 , @entity64 star @entity103 , @entity3 and @entity104			1
@entity3 says great teams need clear and defined leaders that the players can rally behind			1
at @entity91 he identifies former teammate and current club captain @entity109 as such a player			0
nicknamed the @entity112 , the @entity91 team frequently underperformed , however , under the sagging weight of expectation and an excess of big egos			0
@entity3 did n't allow @entity91 's inconsistencies to hold him back , however			2
by the end his career , he had won almost every major honor in the game including the @entity123 and @entity124 with @entity34 and the crown of @entity126 a record three times			1
in 2004 , @entity128 named him the 42nd - highest paid athlete in the world , with earnings of $ 15.8 million a year			0
" people tell me today , ' yeah , it 's easy for you ' and i say no , because when i started no - one knew me			0
i had the skills of course but i made that path myself , and for everything you have to do that			0
" and it is this same mental toughness that has allowed him to shrug off the taunts of the racists and emerge a national hero in a country whose immigrant community has enjoyed an uneasy relationship with the state			0
@entity3 , as he is known affectionately in @entity34 , has tried to stay above the murky world of race politics , only once being drawn into defending his @entity77 heritage after a small - minded attack on his father 's war record			1
this came after the @entity123 win over @entity64 , when a member of the far right political party the @entity157 suggested @entity3 's father was " a harki " -- an @entity161 word for @entity77 who fought alongside the @entity34 in @entity77 's bloody independence struggle			1
after a 2001 friendly match between @entity34 and @entity77 had to be abandoned when angry young @entity34 @entity165 invaded the pitch , @entity3 was forced to break his silence , publically repudiating the libel			1
he still seems reluctant to be turned into a spokesman for @entity34 's @entity171 community -- he tells @entity2 he would prefer to be thought of as an " example " for immigrant children rather than as a hero			2
even so , his heritage is clearly something he remains deeply connected to			0
so that when he was famously sent off in the final of the 2006 @entity123 after a headbutt on @entity87 defender @entity180 in the last act of his career , it was an alleged slur against his family that provoked the attack			1
the headbutt was shocking but not entirely unexpected			0
throughout his career , @entity3 was prone to flashes of temper on the pitch -- he was sent off 14 times in his years as a professional footballer			1
nevertheless , it was an ignoble end for such a prodigious talent			2
@entity3 has refused to apologise to @entity180 because he says that would be like condoning the @entity87 's comments -- exactly what @entity180 said is still in dispute , and two years on , he remains philosophical and largely unrepentent about the incident			2
" when people say i should n't have finished the @entity123 on that note , i do n't look at it that way , " he says			2
" my career is much more than that moment			0

@entity34 ex-footballer @entity3 won every major honor during his career
his talent and modesty won him the respect of his teammates and managers
the son of @entity77 immigrants , he grew up in a poor suburb of @entity80
he *retired* in 2006 after he was sent off in the @entity123 final against @entity216
