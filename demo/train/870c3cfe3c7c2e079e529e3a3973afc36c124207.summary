-- @entity2 president @entity1 warned this week that the country could be on the verge of violent social uprising following more than a week of protests in several cities			2
this discontent in @entity2 comes at the same time as @entity9 is witnessing the largest civil unrest since the 2004 @entity11			2
the protests highlight the significant political instability that has characterized international relations since 2008 , as was predicted by some			1
for instance , in february 2009 , @entity16 director of national intelligence admiral @entity17 asserted that " the financial crisis and global recession are likely to produce a wave of economic crises			1
" then secretary of state @entity24 agreed " this economic crisis , left unresolved ... will upend governments , [ and ] it will unfortunately breed instability			2
" five years on , these @entity16 concerns have been at least partially borne out			0
however , the political instability that has ensued has had diverse origins , and the degree to which the financial crisis has been a driver has varied from country to country			1
in the @entity37 , for instance , millions have taken to the streets and administrations in more than half of the 27 member states fell or were voted out of office from @entity43 to 2012 alone			0
within the core eurozone , 11 of 14 governments collapsed or were turfed out during that same two years			0
even more eye - catching , however , have been the political revolutions and popular uprisings in emerging economies			1
this includes @entity9 and june 's demonstrations in @entity52 ( the largest in the country for two decades ) ; through to what has been called the " @entity75 " in @entity55 and the @entity56 , including the civil war in @entity58 ; revolutionary changes of power in @entity61 , @entity62 , and @entity63 ; transfer of power in @entity65 ; plus demonstrations and uprisings in @entity68 , @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and @entity74			1
despite the diverse nature of this international political instability , from @entity79 , and @entity80 , to @entity81 , it has reportedly been described as " a revolutionary wave , like 1848 " by @entity83 , former director of operations for the @entity85 @entity84			1
others have compared the situation to 1914 , 1968 and 1989			0
whatever the validity of these historical analogies , it is clear that the current " wave " of volatility has been driven by a broad range of economic , political , social and technological factors			1
and , these have played out in contrasting ways across the world			0
in the @entity37 , for instance , the role of economic downturn and austerity since the 2008 financial crisis has been key , especially in those states most impacted by the @entity105 crisis like @entity106 and @entity107			1
unrest , however , has also tapped into pre-existing disquiet with established @entity110 political parties and systems			0
in the @entity56 , by contrast , protest has often stemmed primarily from deep - seated political and socio - economic discontent that has existed for many years			2
post- 2008 , however , factors including liquidity crunches , increased food prices , and unemployment spikes , have exacerbated these longer - standing grievances			2
a key question is whether international political instability will tail off in coming years , especially if economic recovery takes hold in much of the world			1
while this is possible , protest and uprising is likely to continue in some countries for at least two sets of reasons			0
firstly , even if the worst of the financial crisis has now passed , its consequences endure , especially for the increased number of young people who are unemployed			1
this puts many at risk of long - term damage to their earnings potential and job prospects , fuelling discontent			0
in the @entity37 , a record 24.4 % of people under 25 are unable to find work			0
this has given rise to concern , including from @entity149 chancellor @entity148 about a " lost generation , " especially in countries like @entity106 and @entity107 where youth unemployment is almost 60 %			0
as in @entity110 , youth unemployment in numerous @entity56 and @entity55 countries is above 50 % , and it is estimated that the region 's average rate could breach 30 % within 5 years			0
in the @entity56 , the problem is acute because it has the world 's biggest youth bulge comprised of increasing educated people			0
secondly , there are some factors completely unrelated to the post- 2008 financial crisis that will endure , if not intensify			1
this includes the disruptive role of social media			0
there remains debate about how instrumental social media has been in fomenting political instability in recent years , not least in the @entity56 and @entity55			1
however , whether one sees this new technology as an essential component that translated discontent into concrete action , or accentuated what was already - inevitable , indisputably it has played an enabling role that will likely only grow			0
taken as a whole , it is premature to claim , as some have done , that we have entered a new era of global revolution that is here to stay			0
indeed , overall political instability may decline if the world economy enters a sustained recovery			2
however , there remains significant prospect of political volatility , as the current protests in @entity2 and @entity9 underline			1
while circumstances will vary from country to country , instability will potentially be fueled not just by legacy of the financial crisis such as higher youth unemployment , but also longer - standing political and socio - economic discontent which social media is giving new impetus			1
