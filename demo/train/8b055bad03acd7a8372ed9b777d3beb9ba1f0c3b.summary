-- legend has it that when @entity4 's second - in - command asked his boss if he preferred a courageous general or a brilliant general he replied : " what i want is a lucky general			1
" @entity4 knew what others have noted -- on a rapidly changing battlefield , there are the things you know you know , the things you know you do n't know , and the things you do n't know you do n't know			2
it 's in this last category that fortunes are so often made or broken			2
and so it is in our careers			2
the big events that matter most are often those that we can least predict			2
you take a course in college that inspires you to change your major			2
you get a new job after a friend of a friend refers you to a company you 'd never heard of before			0
you propose a process innovation that occurs to you in the shower while thinking about building a tree house for your daughter			1
serendipity is the ability to take a chance occurrence -- a surprising idea , person or event -- and make creative use of it			1
yet serendipity can be exceedingly difficult to pull off in the midst of our busy work lives			1
why ? because we are psychologically wired to find the things that match our expectations and discount what does n't			0
for most of us , our education and work environments only reinforce this behavior			1
we are tunnel - visioned			1
yet the benefits of having a robust peripheral vision are overwhelming			0
besides being responsible for so much of our innovation , peripheral vision is how we discover new opportunities and adapt to a rapidly changing world			0
find the people that matter in business we are often at the mercy of chance to locate the people that we should be working with			1
there was no matchmaking service that brought together @entity74 and @entity75 , @entity76 and @entity77 , or @entity78			0
each of these people put themselves in motion -- they escaped their isolated environments or routines long enough to bump into others			2
@entity85 brought these personalities together , but to achieve success they had to connect , see something in each other and ultimately take the initiative in pursuing the partnership			0
how many collaborators , new hires and customer prospects do we miss because we are n't looking for them when they appear in our lives ? if the answer is " more than a few , " it 's a good time to develop your skill of motion			0
get out of the cubicle , and work for a few hours in the lobby , cafe or cafeteria where visitors are coming in and out all day			1
you might also attend local meetups or conferences , but rather than targeting other people based on where they work or their job title , avoid looking at nametags altogether			1
the people who seem least likely to be able to help you ( e.g. that crazy guy in the tie - dye t - shirt ) might just be the most helpful of all			1

yet he found something that deeply surprised him			0
on every corner of the city there were espresso bars that both served amazing coffee drinks and acted as social meeting places			0
he had never seen anything like it before , and he suddenly knew in his bones that this concept could be huge in @entity142			0
he pitched his bosses on the idea , but they rejected him out of hand			0
they had no interest in becoming a " restaurant " business			2
instead he pursued the idea on his own , ultimately creating the global phenomenon known as @entity150			0
@entity151 was able to see beyond the task he 'd been assigned and imagined a future where the coffee - bar phenomenon had transformed the entire industry			2
like @entity151 , we must foster our peripheral vision to rise above our to - do lists and be ready when a surprise event occurs			1
dedicating time to non work - related interests helps us distance ourselves from our primary tasks			1
this distance allows us to make the connections across domains that lead to insights and innovations			1

having an overriding purpose affects how we see the world			0
@entity172 was committed to improving on the vacuum design , and this gave him eyes to see the solution embedded in the cyclone machine			0
another engineer without this obsession never would have connected the cyclone to a consumer vacuum			0
by developing a strong perspective we increase the likelihood we 'll run into the very things that will be most helpful to us , wherever they emerge from			0
put simply , we can learn to harness serendipity as a rigorous business practice			1
the most successful entrepreneurs and business generally do , allowing chance to intervene in their routinized work lives , recognizing the most promising opportunities , and taking action on them , even if they challenge their best laid plans			1
or , perhaps , precisely because they challenge them			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity209 .			1

we can learn to harness serendipity as a rigorous business practice , says @entity209
serendipity is the ability to take a chance occurrence and make creative use of it , he says
get out of your work cubicle to meet new people and make new connections
@entity209 says we must rise above our to - do lists and be ready when a surprise event occurs
