-- just a two - hour detour from @entity3 , the @entity1 was once a playground to @entity6 royals			2
now its vaunted châteaux are attracting enterprising young couples and artists who have remade them into captivating -- and surprisingly affordable -- inns			0
surrounded by 10 - foot - high limestone walls , @entity12 offers an unexpected sanctuary in the town of @entity16			2
@entity17 @entity18 " if you 've never eaten a brioche with fresh @entity27 goat cheese , honey and walnuts for breakfast , then you have n't been to the @entity1 , " says @entity19 , who is justifiably proud of the simple breakfasts he serves at his 23 - room hotel in the western corner of the valley			1
@entity19 also produces dozens of fragrant artisanal jams such as apple - lavender and quince - cinnamon			2
( sadly , they are n't for sale , but you can buy @entity19 's recipe book , " @entity38			0
" ) the traditional foods fit well with the hotel 's venerable atmosphere : @entity42 is housed in a sprawling 15th - century home that the @entity17 - born @entity19 , along with his two sisters , @entity44 and @entity45 , bought and renovated six years ago			1
@entity0 : see the hotels @entity19 tackled structural issues , taking care to keep the exposed oak beams and original stone walls intact , while his sisters refurbished the rooms with cheerful striped wallpaper , toile bedding , and 19th - century armoires they scavenged on trips to @entity3			1
the largest room , which sleeps four , has double windows with views of a courtyard			2
in the distance lie vineyards full of the red @entity17 grapes much loved by 16th - century novelist and satirist @entity66			1
@entity67 , 011 - 33/2 - 47 - 93 - 18 - 87 , @entity68 , rooms from $ 72			1
@entity70 @entity71 a tunnel of towering fir trees leads to the entrance of this converted 19th - century mill in @entity76 , on the banks of the @entity78			1
guests are greeted by an enormous @entity81 mountain dog named @entity82 and his equally friendly owners , @entity85 and @entity86			0
there are 13 guest rooms , decorated with items such as embroidered quilts and framed puzzles of boats assembled by jigsaw fanatic @entity85			1
jazz enthusiasts , the @entity94 host occasional concerts featuring local groups , including @entity98 , a quartet that performs @entity101 standards			0
the soirees are held in the restaurant , known locally for its coq au vin : rooster stewed in cabernet bottled at @entity109 des @entity108 winery next door			0
11 route @entity111 , 011 - 33/2 - 54 - 71 - 41 - 56 , @entity113 , closed jan. 10 -- feb. 10 and 10 days in nov. , rooms from $ 76 , entrées from $ 15.75			1
@entity117 - @entity116 @entity118 the @entity118 is quiet to the core -- unless you count the chorus of quacks coming from the duck pond on the 35 - acre grounds			2
the 18th - century manor house had been abandoned for 10 years when @entity126 bought it in 1986 and transformed the place into a 12 - room hotel			1
still , the château somehow feels like a private home : a portrait of @entity126 's grandfather hangs over a 100 - year - old antique table in the dining area , and an amiable @entity136 terrier entertains guests with endless rounds of fetch			1
the stylish bedrooms have exposed wood beams and beds draped with coverlets in shades of crimson and marigold			0
@entity0 : see the hotels in the summer , breakfast is served in an expansive glassed - in terrace overlooking the garden			2
a nearby potager ( or kitchen garden ) supplies produce for some of chef @entity154 's breakfast treats , such as a zesty tomato confiture			0
@entity156 , 011 - 33/2 - 47 - 23 - 63 - 60 , chateau - de - lisle.com , rooms from $ 69 , breakfast $ 13			1
@entity159 @entity160 this 18 - room hotel in @entity159 was a must - stay on the itineraries of political notables after @entity165 , when the @entity166 were trying to figure out how to piece @entity167 back together			1
@entity170 , @entity171 and @entity172 all , at one time or another , laid their heads at @entity160			1
( a letter from @entity175 still hangs in the breakfast room			2
) in 2000 , @entity177 and @entity178 acquired the property and completed a top - to - bottom renovation			2
there is no such thing as a standard room here -- tiny singles have just enough space for a twin bed , while one suite fits a family of five			2
the decor is equally varied			0
one room has a @entity193 - style dresser and a crystal chandelier ; another shows off a modern pink - checkered sofa			1
the hotel 's best asset is its proximity ( a five - minute walk ) to @entity201 , which @entity202 gave to his beloved mistress , @entity204 ; the massive 16th - century building hovers over the @entity78			1
7 rue du @entity206 , 011 - 33/2 - 47 - 23 - 90 - 09 , hotel - chenonceau.com , closed nov. -- jan. and @entity208 , rooms from $ 85			1
@entity16 @entity12 surrounded by 10 - foot - high limestone walls , in the heart of the old market center of @entity16 , this 17 - room mansion inn offers an unexpected sanctuary from the town 's bustling , narrow streets			1
the bedrooms come equipped with decorative elements such as mahogany four - poster beds and original fireplaces , while the common room features wood floors modeled after those at the @entity224			1
most of the rooms overlook the hotel 's private park , landscaped with 100 - year - old magnolias and a pine tree that survived the @entity231			1
a pool by the rose garden is perfect for a cool dip after relaxing in the wood sauna , housed in a former stable			2
just a 10 - minute stroll from the hotel stands the riverside castle that belonged to @entity239 -- part medieval fortress , part @entity6 royal house			1
the king became famously enthralled by @entity244 during a 1515 excursion to @entity246 , and he set up the painter in a gabled redbrick château ( now a museum ) , just down the road from his castle			0
27 rue @entity66 , 011 - 33/2 - 47 - 30 - 10 - 20 , @entity252 , closed dec. -- jan. , rooms from $ 98			2
@entity254 @entity255 between the two of them , @entity256 and @entity258 have honed their hospitality skills at some of the world 's most well - respected hotels , including @entity264 in @entity3 and the @entity265 in @entity266			0
after years helping manage other people 's properties , the couple -- with their two small kids , @entity270 and @entity271 -- packed up their @entity3 apartment and bought an unassuming farmhouse in the secluded hamlet of @entity277 to convert to a 15 - room inn			1
" i grew up in the region , so when we made the decision to open our own place , i knew that i had to come back to the @entity1 , " says @entity256			0
in keeping with the spare design of the house , the decor at the @entity284 is simple -- bedrooms are outfitted with neutral suede sofas , blond - wood floors and minimalist photographs of daisies and landscapes			0
the duo oversees the daily lunch and dinner service at the on - site restaurant , which serves local specialties such as butter - poached @entity1 eel and chicken with mustard cream			0
the house dessert , a salted - caramel fruit tart , is baked with apples picked in the hotel 's orchard			0
@entity306 , 011 - 33/2 - 47 - 30 - 16 - 82 , @entity307 , closed dec. 15 -- jan. 15 , rooms from $ 72 , two - course dinner from $ 26			1
@entity310 @entity312 des @entity311 this mansion in the heart of the @entity1 once belonged to the mother of novelist @entity316 ( who mentions the château in her famous work " @entity319 " )			0
later , in the 1960s , its marble hallways were filled with students from a nearby engineering school , which used the building as a dorm			0
in 1992 , another curious owner took over management of the 14 - room château : @entity330 , an artist who kept the mansion 's 19th - century detailing ( high ceilings , gilded mirrors ) but added contemporary design flourishes , such as a photograph of a mysterious pair of eyes in the foyer			1
last year , @entity330 and his wife , @entity339 , redecorated a former gatekeeper 's house as a contemporary four - room cottage with knockoff @entity344 paintings and sculptures that resemble enormous eggs			1
" my husband likes to turn things that seem ordinary into the extraordinary , " @entity339 says			0
" he designed a ' @entity351 ' bidet that has @entity353 robots stationed around the tank			0
" @entity330 also tends a 12 - acre garden of roses and clematises , where guests can find a shed stocked with complimentary bikes for exploring the area 's 186 miles of riding paths			0
@entity362 , 011 - 33/2 - 54 - 20 - 83 - 88 , chateau - tertres.com , closed oct. 19 - apr. 1 , rooms from $ 94			2
@entity365 @entity366 when @entity369 's grandmother found herself widowed at the end of @entity371 , she started selling milk and eggs to make ends meet			0
one thing led to another , and her home eventually became a guesthouse and restaurant specializing in @entity381 country fare , like chicken sautéed in fresh cider			0
three generations later , @entity384 is now proprietor and chef of this inn , which has 26 brightly decorated rooms in shades of sage and rose , as well as a flower - filled garden terrace out back			1
he has kept the breakfast area much the way his grandmother designed it , with rustic stone walls , an ample fireplace and simple country furnishings			0
there are bicycles available to rent ( $ 14.50 per day ) for excursions to the @entity404 , about five miles away			0
34 @entity405 , 011 - 33/2 - 54 - 70 - 42 - 11 , auberge - du - centre.com , closed feb. , rooms from $ 78 , entrées from $ 17			2
@entity408 a two - hour drive southwest of @entity3 , the @entity410 is known for its earthy cabernet franc wines and hundreds of majestic castles			0
it 's impossible to see them all ( a visit to one château can take half a day ) , so it 's wise to focus on the worthy ones : @entity201 , the graceful riverine palace that once belonged to @entity202 ( @entity421 , $ 13 ) ; @entity422 , which has a double - helix staircase inspired by the designs of @entity244 ( @entity425 , $ 12.50 ) ; and @entity426 , renowned for its flamboyant , gilded interiors ( chateau - cheverny.com , $ 9.75 )			1
