-- whether or not we reform our nation 's immigration laws may all come down to cantaloupes versus cojones			1
last year , @entity7 @entity6 congressman @entity6 attacked undocumented immigrant children in @entity9 , saying , " for every one who is a valedictorian , there 's another 100 out there that weigh 130 pounds and they have calves the size of cantaloupes because they 're hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert			0
" colorful though it might have been , that characterization is not only insulting but completely incorrect			0
still , it reflects the underlying sentiment of many @entity9 who oppose immigration reform not just on rational grounds , but based on a deeper , emotional bias			1
then you have everyone else — in fact , the strong majority of @entity9 — who support comprehensive immigration reform , including a workable path to citizenship			1
this crowd certainly includes president @entity37 and @entity38 , who have reiterated that passing immigration reform is one of their key legislative priorities			2
and it presumably includes leaders in the @entity45 , who want to curry favor with business interests and @entity49 voters who support fixing our nation 's broken immigration system			1
so the question is : do @entity45 have the cojones to ignore the " cantaloupe caucus " and do the right thing ? as a refresher , here 's where things stood before the election : in 2013 , the @entity62 - controlled @entity61 passed bipartisan legislation that would create a workable path to citizenship for @entity9 's undocumented immigrants while at the same time ensuring our immigration system and borders works as they 're supposed to for the future			1
although @entity45 controlled the @entity73 , the measure reportedly had enough support from individual @entity45 , as well as @entity38 , to pass			1
but @entity73 speaker @entity75 would n't allow the measure to come up for a vote			1
in the wake of republicans failing to take leadership , president @entity37 said he would consider executive action to do what he could on his own , under his constitutional authority , to provide relief to millions of undocumented immigrants			2
the president held off such action before the election			0
now , if @entity45 again fail to act , executive action is back on the table			2
at a press conference following this year 's midterm elections , president @entity37 said : " i feel obliged to do everything i can lawfully with my executive authority to make sure that we do n't keep on making the system worse , but that whatever executive actions that i take will be replaced and supplanted by action by @entity99			2
you send me a bill that i can sign , and those executive actions go away			0
" if @entity99 wo n't show leadership , the president will			0
in other words , the ball is in @entity45 ' court			2
we should take a moment to remember that in 2005 , it was republicans who championed immigration reform			1
@entity45 sens. @entity113 and @entity114 were instrumental in co-sponsoring and advocating for immigration reform and such efforts were enthusiastically backed by president @entity117			1
by the same token , in 2013 , four @entity61 republicans — @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity120 and @entity121 — joined four @entity38 to craft and pass the currently immigration reform bill			1
@entity121 eventually explicitly opposed his own bill — and last week , @entity121 , @entity113 and @entity114 sent a letter to president @entity37 implicitly criticizing the bill suggesting there should be no path to citizenship until border security demands are met ( whereas the pending legislation addresses both simultaneously )			0
meanwhile , republicans have used border security as a constantly - retreating goalpost to stall meaningful immigration reform			1
if president @entity37 uses his constitutional authority to take limited action on immigration relief , it will not be without legal or political precedent			0
in 2012 , president @entity37 directed his administration to focus his immigration enforcement away from so - called dreamers brought to the @entity9 as children			0
but presidents @entity144 and @entity145 also used executive action to protect the spouses and children of immigrants who were granted legal status under 986 immigration reform — arguably using their executive authority to extend the law beyond @entity99 action			2
the @entity45 base may now retroactively condemn their hero @entity144 for " amnesty , " but they do n't condemn him as a domineering tyrant			1
yet while president @entity37 has issued fewer executive orders than his predecessors , @entity45 regularly smear @entity37 for acting like a " king " — repeated just this week by sen. @entity163			2
speaker @entity75 has said if president @entity37 acts on his own to give relief to our nation 's 11 million undocumented immigrants , he will in effect " @entity165 " for any compromise legislation			0
and yet it is @entity75 who already poisoned the political landscape , failing to wrangle a @entity45 caucus that has continually proven itself ungovernable and yet now has the full responsibility to govern			2
it does n't seem to matter what principles or ideals @entity45 embraced in the past			1
their essential ideology right now is anti-obama			0
remember , these are the same " leaders " who shut down our federal government , at an economic cost of $ 24 billion , basically out of spite			0
president @entity37 has shown plenty of good faith effort to compromise with republicans in general and around immigration reform in particular			1
as the president said in his post-midterms press briefing : " the @entity61 on a bipartisan basis passed a good bill			1
it was n't perfect , it was n't exactly what i wanted , but it was a sound , smart piece of legislation that really would greatly improve not just our immigration system but our economy and would improve business conditions here in the @entity9 and make sure that @entity9 - born workers are n't undercut by workers who are undocumented and are n't always paid a fair wage and as a consequence , employers who are breaking the rules are able to undercut folks who are doing the right thing			2
" that 's what governing looks like — working together on compromise legislation for the good of the country , not political posturing			0
indeed , @entity45 have the most to gain from supporting immigration reform			1
after the 2012 elections , @entity45 chairman @entity221 led an " autopsy " arguing that , among other moves , @entity45 must show leadership on immigration reform or risk permanently alienating the growing percentage of @entity49 voters			1
but now , after the midterms ? @entity221 tried to blame @entity37 for inaction on immigration reform			2
for added measure , @entity221 all but called the @entity233 a liar : " i do n't believe a thing he says , " @entity221 told @entity0			0
leadership is more than name - calling			0
leadership is more than flip flopping on principles			0
leadership is more than being against whatever the other side is for			0
leadership is working together to solve problems			0
it 's time @entity45 finally step up , grow some cojones and lead on immigration reform			1
and if they fail to do so — again — then president @entity37 will be right to take action on his own and show leadership			0
after all , someone has to .			0

@entity253 says republicans are now on the spot about immigration
while some leaders have favored reform , @entity45 activists have fought a deal
@entity61 passed a major overhaul of immigration but @entity73 would n't bring it to vote
she says current *climate* tests whether @entity45 is serious about governing
