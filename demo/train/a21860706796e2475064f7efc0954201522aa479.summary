-- you 've probably seen the new @entity3 tv ads with actor @entity4 having what looks like the most charming chat of his life with @entity8 , the voice - activated " personal assistant " on the @entity9			1
" that 's pretty spectacular advice , actually , " @entity4 says after @entity8 tells him to avoid fat , read good books , take walks and " live together in peace and harmony " with everyone			1
" i enjoyed this chat immensely , " he continues in his familiar soothing - creepy voice			2
" you are very eloquent			0
" to many other @entity9 owners , however , @entity8 is n't such a scintillating conversationalist			2
she oftens fails to understand what 's spoken to her , and many of her responses are little more than lists of @entity27 search results			0
disappointed @entity9 users have even filed a class - action suit against @entity3 , claiming that @entity8 does n't work as well as advertised			1
@entity30 : @entity8 's father comes to her defense that may be about to change , however			2
in the eight months since she debuted in october , @entity8 has been " studying up and learning a lot more , " @entity3 senior vice president @entity34 said during a presentation monday at @entity3 's annual developers ' conference			1
@entity34 then previewed some advancements to @entity8 that will come this fall as part of @entity42 , the company 's next mobile operating system			1
@entity3 is equipping @entity8 with new databases of knowledge , including the ability to retrieve sports scores			1
she 'll also be able to open an app for you , search movie showtimes , post @entity53 updates , make restaurant reservations and provide turn - by - turn navigation to drivers with @entity3 's new maps application			1
but based on the glimpses we saw monday , the most interesting improvement to @entity8 may be the language she uses in her answers , which already sound more natural and conversational			2
for example , @entity34 demoed @entity8 onstage by asking , " who is taller : @entity68 or @entity69 ? " ( for the @entity67 stars , no last names were required , apparently			0
) instead of directing him to a web search or maybe pulling up info on @entity73 beef , @entity8 answered without hesitation : " @entity68 appears to be slightly taller			0
" @entity75 , writing for the @entity77 , called this exchange " the most important thing that was said on stage " over the course of @entity3 's 90 - minute event			1
" what the question really demonstrated , however , is that @entity3 's strongest , most dazzling weapon in the war to differentiate its @entity9 from all those other smartphones just received a fresh stockpile of ammunition , " @entity75 wrote			1
he argues that a refined @entity8 may be a bigger boost to future iphones and @entity92 than the other new features @entity3 announced monday , most of which already exist on rival devices			1
" it was @entity8 flawlessly and quickly answering a mundane question about basketball that @entity3 should be most excited about : @entity68 is taller , @entity8 is smarter , and the bewitching @entity3 advertising juggernaut shall parade forward , " @entity75 added			2
@entity3 did not respond tuesday to a request for more details about the next - generation @entity8 , which will probably come standard on the next @entity9 this fall			1
but it 's clear from ceo @entity107 's recent comments that @entity3 sees @entity8 as a big part of its mobile future			1
" @entity8 is one of the most popular features of @entity9 , " @entity107 said at last month 's @entity111 conference			2
" but there 's more that it can do , and we have a lot of people working on this			0
and i think you will be really pleased with some of the things you 're going to see over the coming months			0
we have some cool ideas about what @entity8 can do			0
we have a lot going on on this			0
... sure , it can be broader , and so forth , but we see unbelievable potential here			0
we 're doubling down on it			0
" we 'll probably find out by late october whether a new @entity8 is better company than the current one			0
maybe by then , people will stop mocking the @entity4 ads.			0

despite ads showing @entity4 *yukking* it up , some users are n't happy with @entity8
but @entity8 , the voice - activated " personal assistant , " will get an upgrade this fall
next version of @entity3 's mobile operating system will feature *enhanced* @entity8 functions
the new @entity8 will retrieve sports scores and make restaurant reservations
