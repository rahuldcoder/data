-- in 1984 , during the first ever @entity2 , i was a 20 - year - old @entity3 student			1
watching the show with my roommates from our off - campus apartment , @entity10 's wedding gown - clad , iconic performance of " @entity12 " made an indelible stamp on me			1
i saw what an unexpected , dynamic television performance could do to elevate a show and an artist , and absorbed it all as the @entity2 infiltrated pop culture			1
i finally made it to the third @entity2 , covering the show for @entity0			1
it was a bi-coastal event that year , and i was in @entity22 at the palladium			2
amid a torrential downpour , i stood alongside 40 or so reporters vying to get interviews with artists like mr. @entity28 and @entity29 as publicists tossed swag to keep us happy			0
@entity34 's vjs like " @entity35 " @entity36 and @entity37 hosted the show , and @entity39 took home " @entity42 " for " @entity41			1
" the cultural impact of the @entity2 and the network as a whole was undeniable : @entity34 was in the middle of transforming the music and entertainment industry			1
i wanted to be part of that energy , and by 1987 , i was			0
vmas have always been a mix of incredible planned performances and unexpected moments			0
in 2000 , we surprised the audience as an army of blond @entity59 clones marched into the show as the rapper sang " @entity62			1
" in 2003 , we reached into our past as @entity10 reprised her first @entity2 performance			1
but this time , she was the groom and @entity66 and @entity67 were rocking the white wedding dresses			0
in a surprise moment for all of us , they closed their performance with one of the most memorable kisses in pop culture history			0
another big surprise for our team , much to the chagrin of @entity79 , came in the form of a meat dress in 2010 as @entity82 brought her unique sense of style to the stage			0
sometimes the show is all about timing			2
for example , in 1995 we had just started an interview outside the show with @entity91 and @entity10 while the @entity2 were still on - air			1
our crew caught sight of @entity94 walking down the street by herself , headed straight toward us			0
she started yelling , trying to get our attention , and then began throwing her make - up one piece at a time up at @entity91 and @entity10			0
on camera , @entity91 said " @entity94 is throwing stuff at us			0
" from inside the production truck , the producers encouraged @entity94 to join the interview			0
@entity94 stumbled up the stairs and onto the stage , interrupting @entity10 , and the rest is @entity2 history			1
the @entity2 have a legacy of being one of the most memorable nights in music , and our incredibly talented team does whatever it takes to bring the biggest moments and most talented artists to the stage			1
booking the perfect mix of those performances can sometimes come down to the wire , though			0
twelve days before the show in 2008 , we still had n't locked in our perfect closing act			1
at the time , i was on my way to @entity123 to cover then - sen. @entity125 's acceptance speech at the @entity126			2
i called @entity127 and as it turned out , he was already in @entity129			0
he picked me up from the airport and we spent the ride listening to rough demos of a new song he was working on			0
from the second i heard it , i knew this was the big , closing performance we wanted for the show			2
i shared our team 's vision of that year 's event and some sketches of the set and we talked through what his performance could look like			1
a few days later we were both in @entity148 in advance of the big night			0
our team went to work finalizing the details , and he went to the studio and finished " @entity157 , " knowing that he 'd be sharing it with the world for the first time just a few days later at the @entity2			2
for all the great moments , sometimes things go wrong			0
i 'll never forget the moment in 1991 when the lights went out during one of @entity91 's live interviews , keeping the entire audience in the dark			1
@entity166 was in the middle of giving a heartfelt tribute to @entity169 when the prompter went out in 2001			0
the same year , we left @entity172 hanging , literally			2
the band was 20 feet above the stage and ready to descend			0
just as we announced their performance live on television , the band 's power source went out			2
the band could n't play , so all we heard was @entity180 joking that @entity34 did n't pay the electric bill			1
in 2004 , we thought it would be a great idea to bring out the children of the presidential candidates			0
as the audience started to boo , we quickly realized that was n't what the viewers wanted out of their @entity2			1
i 've now had the letters " @entity34 " in front of my job title for 24 years and can tell you that this is a network that does n't grow up , or old , with its audience -- and neither do the @entity2			1
the show is constantly evolving , and our audience expects change , innovation , risk and creativity from us			2
it takes the effort of hundreds of people combined with dedicated artists to plan , create and share amazing moments like when @entity210 ! sang " @entity217 " from a trapeze high above the @entity2 ' stage or when @entity213 sang " @entity216 " as she ran up from a @entity22 subway car to take over @entity215			2
but , we also know that we need to create the right formula for unexpected moments , which means getting the right mix of people in the same room with the perfect music for a memorable night			0
this year 's entire show is re-imagined for today 's generation of viewers			1
the show will open with @entity82 , followed by a night of incredible performances by @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 and @entity235			2
the legendary @entity236 will present a special tribute to @entity238			0
and , we will be watching along with the rest of the world to see what surprise moments steal the show			0
from a leaky tent outside the @entity245 to the highly designed , immersive time portal environment viewers will see this year , the @entity2 have absolutely evolved through the years			1
the constant , though , are the talented artists who take over the @entity2 stage , capturing our audience 's attention with legendary , iconic moments that will be remembered for years to come .			1

this year 's entire show is re-imagined for today 's generation of viewers
