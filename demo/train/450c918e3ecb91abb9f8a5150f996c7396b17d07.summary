-- @entity2 voters may finally be losing their appetite for @entity5 's off - color " jokes , " but if the rise of @entity9 is any indication , there 's still more than enough room in @entity2 politics for another showman			1
known as the " clown prince " of @entity2 politics , @entity9 is a 64 - year - old comedian turned politician whose @entity17 ( @entity17 ) is winning the hearts , minds and votes of @entity2 fed up with mainstream parties			1
" my vision was just to make jokes about politicians , " the comedian , whose real name is @entity9 , told @entity0 before the elections			1
" then i made this joke about how this politician was stealing -- and he actually was			1
" that joke about @entity31 politician @entity30 on @entity2 tv show @entity32 in the 1980s saw him effectively banned from television			1
he then took his energetic , polemical and provocative act to the theater			2
during one performance @entity9 smashed a pile of computers on stage while lamenting modern society 's dependency on technology			1
years later , technology would be the key to his success			2
since then he 's found a new audience at huge public rallies rallies and on the internet : it 's been dubbed the " @entity50			1
" despite his searing attacks on the political class , @entity9 does not blame former prime minister @entity5 for @entity2 's current problems			1
" @entity5 was a consequence , " he said			2
" he was the ultimate salesman but one who publicized products with no substance , like a shop with a beautifully lit window but nothing concrete to sell			0
his political appearance is already history , ancient history even			0
" @entity2 's octogenarian president , @entity64 , had dismissed the surge in support for @entity9 , saying the only boom he knows was the economic one in the mid- 80s			1
but the comedian dismissed the criticism			2
" he does n't understand there are millions of @entity2 out there who ca n't stand this any longer			2
" you ca n't ask an @entity2 , an entrepreneur , a family to make sacrifices when the presidency costs about 240 million euros a year			2
do you understand this ? our president earns three times as much as ( @entity85 president @entity84 )			0
an @entity2 ambassador earns 20,000 euros per month			2
@entity87 earns 9,000 a month			0
you can not expect sacrifices right now , because we should all make sacrifices right now or no one will			0
" this kind of talk has touched a raw nerve with @entity2 voters , roughly a quarter of whom cast ballots for @entity17 in the lower house of parliament			1
this success reflects a growing trend in other parts of @entity104 where disillusionment is seeing a shift away from mainstream parties			0
" we have a lot of trouble right now , and he 's a different way to do politics , to change things from the ground , " said @entity9 supporter @entity108			1
" we do n't trust the parties any more , " added @entity115 , a @entity116 candidate			0
" they did n't do good things in the past and they 're not doing them in the present			0
" " @entity2 politics are not changing			1
we have the same politicians as we did five years ago			0
it 's time to change -- i want to see new faces , " said @entity126 , a @entity9 supporter			2
while there is little doubt @entity9 can entertain a crowd , questions remain over whether he can destabilize mainstream @entity2 politics			1
his critics dismiss him as a loudmouth and say he simply does n't have the policies for the mainstream stage			0
but asked about his position on the euro , for instance , @entity9 replied : " i 'm not asking to leave the euro , but to sit around a table and ask it better to maintain the status quo thus taking @entity2 on this downward slope or is it better to ask what we 'd need to sacrifice in order to get out of the euro			1
is it better with or without the euro ? " " ten out of 27 countries do n't have the euro			0
they do n't have a risk of defaulting			0
we have undersold our democracy by spreading it			0
" what seems clear after the election is that @entity9 's movement will a force to be reckoned with in @entity2 politics for the foreseeable future			1
@entity9 has called @entity17 " an experiment of hyper - democracy			1
the one thing that i have understood is that we are going through an ethical change of culture , not politics			2
" it is a cultural revolution of the society : to change the political class is the first step			0
the one thing i am certain of is that the political class is finished			0
they have liquefied in political diarrhea			0
there is nothing left ... nothing			0
