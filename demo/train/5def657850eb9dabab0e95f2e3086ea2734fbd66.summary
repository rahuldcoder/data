-- an intense typhoon has carved across the southern @entity3 , destroying buildings , setting off floods and landslides and killing at least 95 people , authorities said wednesday			1
@entity8 struck the large southern island of @entity10 , which is rarely in the direct path of tropical cyclones , fueling fears that it could be as devastating as a storm that killed more than 1,200 people there almost a year ago			1
@entity8 , the most powerful typhoon to hit @entity10 in decades , had top winds of 175 kph ( 110 mph ) as it came ashore over the city of @entity21 early tuesday			1
millions of people , many of whom live in remote and unprepared communities , were in the storm 's path , @entity3 authorities and aid groups said			1
watch : @entity30 captures @entity32 aftermath in southern @entity3 " it really is getting to be a very , very big typhoon and it 's just starting , " @entity33 , the head of the @entity34 , said tuesday			1
trees have been uprooted and fragile houses blown away on @entity10 , @entity33 said , adding that the corrugated iron roofs of some buildings were being carried through the air by the wind like " flying machetes			1
" at least 95 people have been killed so far as a result of the storm , the @entity44 said wednesday			1
the typhoon has affected more than 213,000 people , demolished houses and stranded people in two @entity10 regions and parts of the @entity54 region , according to the disaster agency			1
more than 179,000 people are in evacuation centers , it said			0
a landslide in eastern @entity10 blocked a national highway , the news agency reported , leavening hundreds of people in buses , vans and cars stuck on the road			1
@entity67 : plight of typhoon evacuees maintenance workers were using heavy equipment to clear the mud and rocks , said @entity74 , a spokesperson for the @entity75 cited by the news agency			2
the tightly packed but fierce typhoon churned west northwest across the island , weakening slightly as it went , the @entity77 said			2
by wednesday morning , the center of the storm was approaching the outlying western island of @entity83			2
but it continued to soak a wide area with heavy rain , raising the risk of mudslides and flash floods elsewhere			0
the storm , dubbed " @entity92 " in the @entity3 , had blown up into a super typhoon at one point monday as it moved over the ocean , with sustained winds greater than 240 kph -- the equivalent of a category 5 hurricane in the @entity99 , the @entity90 reported			1
that wind speed is two and a half times the top winds of @entity102 , known in the @entity3 as @entity102 , whose heavy rains swept away entire villages in the same region in december 2011			2
" many emotional people in ( @entity10 ) trying to prepare for @entity92 with @entity102 fresh in their minds , " @entity107 , the @entity3 director for the children 's charity @entity108 , wrote monday on @entity110			1
but local authorities have done a good job of relocating people out of vulnerable areas and preparing evacuation centers , said @entity33 of the @entity34			0
@entity102 , on the other hand , caught many residents off guard			0
it was a weaker storm , but its torrential rain triggered landslides and flash floods in the middle of the night , when many people were sleeping			2
more than 1,200 people died and hundreds of thousands were left homeless , prompting a humanitarian crisis			1
ahead of @entity8 's arrival on tuesday , government agencies relocated more than 50,000 people to evacuation centers			2
they also moved millions of dollars worth of relief supplies into position for quick delivery to storm - hit regions and put emergency crews , the military and hospitals on standby			0
school classes were suspended in many cities , and dozens of flights were canceled , according to the national disaster agency			0
nearly 5,000 travelers were left stranded at ports across the country as of wednesday because of disruption to ferry services			0
@entity150 , a tiny island nation roughly 1,000 kilometers ( 600 miles ) east of @entity10 , had a close shave with @entity153 earlier in the week as the typhoon churned past , catching some outlying parts of the archipelago			1
" it was headed right toward @entity150 , " said @entity157 , a meteorologist for the @entity159 @entity158 in @entity160			0
but at the last minute , " it just turned to the west and fortunately went south of them , " he said			0
" i really think they escaped the brunt of the storm , " @entity157 said in an interview with the @entity166 , noting that @entity150 does n't usually get hit by strong typhoons			0
@entity8 nonetheless brought down a lot of trees and caused widespread power outages in @entity150 , according to @entity157			0
" the fast movement of the system really prevented a lot of flooding , " he said			0
" i think probably only a few inches of rain fell , so that 's certainly good news , because @entity150 itself is susceptible to mudslides			0
" @entity0 's @entity184 and @entity185 , @entity186 and @entity187 contributed to this report .			0
