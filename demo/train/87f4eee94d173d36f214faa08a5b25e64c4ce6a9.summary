close your eyes and imagine the " center " of @entity4			1
what do you see ? is it the rolling plains of @entity8 , or @entity10 's field of skyscrapers ? the foggy @entity12 , or a gated community ? lately , all i can see is @entity15 , the now - famous @entity17 town where , in august , a police officer shot and killed an unarmed black teenager , @entity19			1
it 's a place no one had heard of a year ago but now finds itself at the center of the news cycle , at the center of our national attention and at the center of a new and profound sense of worry that racial injustice may long divide us still			0
but the national focus is always shifting			0
not far from @entity15 -- 167.8 miles to be exact -- is a place that , by definition , is a different kind of " center " of the country -- the statistical mean center of population			1
that probably sounds meaningless , but , according to the @entity39 , it 's the place " where an imaginary , flat , weightless and rigid map of the @entity4 would balance perfectly if all residents were of identical weight			1
" the spot has moved west and south as @entity4 themselves have pushed out of the 13 colonies and , now , into the desert @entity47			1
the dot , in that narrow sense , tells a particular part of our national story			0
and , as of 2010 , that spot rests in @entity54 , @entity17			1
@entity54 's demographics mirror neither @entity15 's nor the nation 's			1
in a country that is becoming increasingly diverse ( whites no longer will be in the majority by 2043 , according to the census ) , @entity54 is almost completely caucasian			1
the nation is urbanizing ( 81 % of @entity4 live urban areas , according to the 2010 census , up from 79 % in 2000 ) ; @entity54 , meanwhile , is about as rural as they come			1
when i visited the town in 2011 for a @entity0 story , i clocked a drive across town at 1 minute and 9 seconds , and that 's assuming you 're obeying the 40 - mph speed limit			0
in other words : @entity54 is n't @entity4 , but it 's still part of @entity4			1
this paradox -- what does this almost - random place say about the rest of us ? -- is what drew me to the tiny town for a story on a @entity39 ceremony that designated the town as our national population center			1
it 's also what captivated @entity90 photographer @entity89 , who has visited @entity54 at least nine times in recent years			1
he plans to keep going back until about 2020 , when the mean population center will change , likely moving to the west in tow with itinerant @entity4			1
i got a chance to talk by phone with @entity89 recently , and you can see some of his photos from the project in the gallery above			1
we spoke before the protests broke out in @entity15 and across the nation following a grand jury 's decision not to indict the officer who shot @entity19			0
maybe that 's just as well because @entity89 told me he aimed to take " timeless " photos of @entity54 : there is a photo of a boy laying on the grass by a trailer tire , for example , and a portrait of @entity116 , now deceased , holding two of his walking sticks			1
when i asked @entity89 who the most interesting person in @entity54 was , his first of several replies was @entity116 , who he said was a @entity123 veteran and cowboy			1
@entity116 was building barns and bending metal into his 80s , @entity89 told me			2
just an ordinary , hard - working dude			0
maybe it seems quaint in this time of turmoil			0
but this place , like @entity15 , is part of our story			0
that seems to be part of @entity89 's assertion with these photos			2
he told me he 's still trying to figure out in what ways @entity54 is and is n't relevant to our national identity -- or if any one place can actually be a microcosm for a nation of 316 million			2
@entity54 , i 'll remind you , is home to 109			2
social media follow @ @entity148 on @entity149 to join the conversation about photography			0
when he first visited @entity54 , @entity89 said he was struck by the fact that it appeared to be a town that " does n't really have a center			1
" " there 's no real middle of the town , " he said , other than maybe the school , which is a community rallying point			0
the same could be said of @entity4			2
this is the age of the 99 % and the 1 % -- red and blue , black and white			0
we 've always been a country divided , but those divisions seem to be especially visible now -- particularly the income gap , which has been widening since the 70s ; the race gap ; and , importantly , the underlying empathy gap			0
maybe that 's where @entity54 has something humble but important to contribute to our national conversation			2
this is a place , according to @entity89 , where people still talk to each other -- where they care about each other , and where they 're willing to debate sensitive issues			2
@entity89 is from the @entity182 area and now lives in @entity90			2
his politics lean left , where @entity54 's are solidly right			2
visiting @entity54 might have seemed like stepping into a foreign country			0
except it was surprisingly easy for him to gel there			0
" their values are the same as my values , " he told me			0
" they 're very interested in trying to support their families			0
they 're interested in having a good education for their children			0
they 're interested in having some support for when they retire			0
@entity89 is a documentary photographer based in @entity204 , @entity90			1
you can follow him on @entity206 and @entity207 .			0

photographer @entity89 has spent years documenting @entity54 , @entity17
@entity54 was named the " mean center of population " for the @entity4
