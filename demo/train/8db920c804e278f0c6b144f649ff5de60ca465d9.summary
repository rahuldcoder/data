@entity0 -- @entity2 , the economist nominated to become @entity4 's new prime minister , began talks with political leaders monday to discuss forming a government			1
the 68 - year - old 's talks with political parties will continue tuesday			0
in comments after several meetings monday , @entity2 said some of the delegations had discussed a " temporal outlook " for how long his government might last			2
the time for the government " which i am trying to create is that period between today and the end of spring 2013 , " he said , according to a @entity1 translation			1
at any time the parliament could dissolve his government " because of lack of trust , " he said			0
it is " obvious " that the task at hand is an emergency , and that to achieve economic growth and social equity " should be the priorities , " @entity2 said			0
the new prime minister designate will face an arduous task , as @entity4 has one of the highest national debts in @entity35 at â ‚ ¬ 1.9 trillion ( $ 2.6 trillion ) -- about 120 % of gdp -- and has seen low growth in recent years			1
to take the helm , @entity2 needs the approval of the @entity4 @entity40 , which is composed of multiple parties with diverse interests			1
@entity44 's @entity43 remains the strongest force in parliament , and @entity44 has said he plans to remain active in it			0
those diverse political interests and the pain of austerity measures could weigh heavily on @entity2 as he steers @entity4 through economically troubled waters			1
some politicians in @entity4 have already called for elections to take place sooner than their scheduled time of spring 2013			1
@entity4 party leaders spoke in support of the new prime minister designate on @entity4 's senate tv after exiting deliberations with @entity2 on the composition of a new government			1
@entity63 , leader of the @entity64 , said his group is " happy that the @entity44 government could be replaced by the @entity2 government			1
" his party will not block a @entity2 - led government , he said			2
but when asked specifically whether he would give @entity2 a vote of confidence , @entity63 stressed that he would not answer until he learned more about @entity2 's plans and the composition of his @entity74			0
@entity75 , leader of the @entity76 , also told reporters his block will support @entity2 's government			1
@entity80 of the @entity81 expressed support for @entity2 as well			2
speaking to reporters , @entity80 called for reforms to address @entity4 's political and economic crisis			2
@entity2 was nominated sunday to replace @entity44 as @entity4 's prime minister			1
@entity44 resigned saturday amid the country 's ongoing financial crisis			2
his role in @entity4 's political future is uncertain			0
" for the time being he is waiting to see what is happening under the buildup of the new government under mr. @entity2 , " said @entity91 , a member of @entity4 's @entity40 and former assistant to @entity44			1
on monday , @entity91 said @entity44 told her he wants to continue acting as the chair of his @entity99 party			2
@entity44 's resignation was greeted with cheers and dancing in the streets , as people waved the @entity4 flag and sang the nation 's anthem			1
if he becomes prime minister , @entity2 could bring a distinctly different approach to governing than @entity4 has experienced over the past three years			1
" it may be that the strong opposition ... against @entity44 that has been going on in these years maybe will disperse itself , maybe will finish , and then we 'll have a cooperative approach on the part of all the political forces			0
... let 's hope that the international credibility of mr. @entity2 will be able to work in this direction , " @entity91 told @entity1			0
while the hot - blooded @entity44 was for many years a master of forming political alliances , @entity2 is known for his achievements as a " @entity122 , " at the heart of @entity35 's institutions			1
dubbed @entity125 for his work in international finance , he served as a leading @entity129 member for a decade -- including as commissioner for its financial services , market and taxation committee between 1995 and 1999 and as head of its competition committee from 1999 to 2004			0
in announcing @entity2 's nomination , @entity4 president @entity138 said the former @entity141 commissioner is " gifted , competent , experienced " and well - respected in @entity35 and internationally			1
" this is the moment of his test , " @entity138 said			0
@entity2 must return to @entity138 within days to accept the nomination fully , at which point he would be sworn in and officially become prime minister			0
within days of the oath of office , @entity2 would have to go to parliament to present his government -- essentially his cabinet and his government plan			2
the upper and lower houses of parliament have 10 days from the time @entity2 is sworn in to hold separate votes of confidence on the new government			2
@entity44 is the second prime minister to resign this month over the debt crisis sweeping across @entity35			1
@entity160 's @entity159 was replaced wednesday by @entity161 , a former @entity162 official			0
investors were watching @entity4 bond yields closely monday , after â ‚ ¬ 3 billion worth of five - year bonds generated decent demand			0
yields on both the five - year and 10 - year bonds still remain around 6.5 %			0
last week , the 10 - year @entity4 yield spiked to a record high above 7 % -- a level that eventually led to bailouts for @entity160 , @entity173 and @entity174			0
economists said monday 's bond yields could indicate that markets are still nervous about @entity4 's economic prospects , even with @entity2 in charge			1
" now what we are seeing today is that markets probably do n't like so much politics being so effective and so active in financial matters			0
so my feeling is that the challenge today will be rebalancing ... politics and financial matters , " @entity91 told @entity1 monday			0
@entity1 's @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 and the @entity193 staff contributed to this report .			0
