[ breaking news update , saturday , 12:54 a.m. et ] the number of power outages that occurred across 16 states and the @entity4 during the latest winter storm dropped to 525,273 early friday from a previous 625,000 late thursday			1
[ originally published story , friday , 9:55 a.m. et ] massive winter storm taking toll in power outages , canceled flights -- and lives ( @entity12 ) -- enough already			1
as if the @entity14 had n't gotten the point by now , @entity13 drove it home yet again -- that this is winter , hear it roar			2
roar it did thursday , as a massive storm system that just finished pummeling much of the @entity17 moved northward			1
some of what fell from the sky was rain , some was sleet , some was snow			1
whatever it was , it made for a mess			2
fast - falling snow caused tractor - trailers to jackknife and prompted authorities in @entity30 to ban commercial traffic on @entity32 -- a major east - west highway running through the state -- the state transportation department tweeted			1
as of 9:30 p.m. , the @entity30 metro area was already buried : the @entity36 reported up to 11 inches in the @entity37 , 14 inches in @entity38 , @entity39 , and even more than that in @entity41 , @entity42 , home to the recent @entity43			2
and it 's not like the end is near			2
another round is expected to wallop the same area overnight , coming down 1 to 3 inches an hour at times			1
and @entity49 ' @entity48 could see 14 to 24 inches of snow before the storm runs its course			1
for some , the issue is n't just the fact that there 's snow : this is winter , after all , in the @entity58			1
but it 's more that people there have n't gotten much of a reprieve			0
that 's why @entity30 mayor @entity64 , opening up his press conference thursday , said : " welcome to winter storm six of the last six weeks			1
" and as @entity42 gov. @entity67 pointed out before the worst of the storm hit : " this has just been a brutal winter where it never really has gotten warmer			1
and so the natural melting away of snow and ice is not happening			1
" especially over its full course , this storm has proven to be nothing to mess with			2
at least 16 deaths have been blamed on the storm			1
three of them were in @entity83 , @entity84 , where three men -- ages 45 , 55 and 57 -- suffered suspected cardiac arrest " while in the act of shoveling snow , " said county spokesman @entity88 , who noted that what fell there was " a heavy wet snow			1
" there were also three deaths apiece in @entity96 and @entity97 , including one in a rural part of the latter due to a falling tree limb			1
and in the @entity30 borough of @entity102 , a 36 - year - old pregnant woman died after being struck by a small tractor clearing snow			2
her nearly full - term baby was delivered by cesarean section at a hospital and was in critical condition			0
amid such tragedy , even as people hunker down or cope without electricity , life has gone on , too			0
@entity114 documented the snowy , icy , windy morass thursday for @entity118 , calling this system " one of the more aggressive @entity121 " she 's seen since returning to @entity123 four years ago			0
at the same time , she added , " the usual drivers and pedestrians ( are ) attempting to go about their business as usual			0
" power outages ; about 6,500 flights canceled there was nothing usual about thursday for @entity131			1
the @entity132 , @entity133 , woman 's power went out at 6 a.m. wednesday -- her birthday , of all days			2
and 34 hours later , it was still out			0
over that time , she and her teenage daughter took turns going back and forth to their car to get warmed up by the engine and heater , and charge their phones			0
when they tried to contact the local utility , @entity131 says , the calls went straight to voice mail -- leaving her with no idea when her lights and heat would come back on			0
" we are just frustrated , " @entity131 said late thursday afternoon , hours after first alerting @entity118 to her ordeal			0
venturing out on the still slippery roads , @entity131 and her daughter did manage to buy lunch but could n't find any available firewood			0
that 's one reason why she 's strongly considering trying to find somewhere warm to spend the night			0
as she said , " it 's too cold			0
i ca n't go through this another night with my daughter			0
" unfortunately , @entity131 has plenty of company in being in the dark			0
some 625,000 customers -- more than half of whom were in @entity169 -- were without power up and down the @entity14 as of 6:45 p.m. one positive was that number was down about 75,000 from a few hours earlier , indicating utilities were making progress			1
many others have other kinds of headaches , like would - be air travelers			0
@entity178 , an air travel tracking website , reported around 8 p.m. thursday that nearly 6,500 flights originating in or destined for the @entity181 had been canceled			1
@entity183 's airport in @entity97 was among the most impacted			1
still , there are few along the @entity14 -- from @entity185 to @entity4 to @entity186 to @entity187 -- that have n't had their schedules turned upside down , yet again , by this winter storm			1
and rail travel has n't been immune			0
@entity193 has suspended some service in the @entity58 , @entity196 and @entity197 regions again for thursday			0
@entity14 travelers brave another nasty day @entity97 governor : ' some people did n't take my warning ' in and around @entity185 , the storm could have been worse			1
for proof , all @entity205 had to do was think back two weeks ago -- when motorists ditched hundreds of cars along roads , students had to camp out overnight in school and some spent upwards of 20 hours stuck on impassable roads			0
this time around , the state seemed to have learned its lesson			0
a combination of snow , ice and rain slammed @entity133 , leading to widespread power outages			1
but this time , at least , people stayed off the roads			0
it seemed like deja vu , though , for a time in @entity97			1
there , the snow showed up fast and furious in the middle of the day on wednesday			2
and when motorists hit the road , many got stuck -- with some of them even leaving their vehicles in the road and walking away altogether			0
yet gov. @entity232 , speaking thursday to @entity12 , resisted comparing what happened in his state to what had happened earlier in @entity133			0
he pointed out that he 'd declared a state of emergency and began warning people " do n't put your stupid hat on " well ahead of the storm			2
" some people did n't take my warning , " @entity232 said			0
there were drivers who spent four to five hours in gridlock traffic but none were on the road overnight , added the governor			2
and by thursday , when round two of the storm rolled through , much of the state was quiet as people hunkered down inside			2
rather than pin it on officials or citizens , @entity232 suggested that the uniquely large , powerful , fast - moving storm deserved the blame for it all -- the traffic jams , the widespread blackouts , and the deadly dangerous conditions outside			2
in @entity97 alone , the storm was hitting in full force in five different metropolitan areas at the same time			1
" we have not seen a storm like this in decades , " the governor said			1
opinion : storms could 've been worse			0

power outages in 16 states and @entity4 down to 525,000 from 625,000
at least 16 deaths are linked to storm , including 3 while shoveling snow in @entity84
some 625,000 customers are without power ; nearly 6,500 flights are canceled
@entity97 governor says , " " we have not seen a storm like this in decades "
