@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 republicans will not watch monday night 's presidential debate in the same way as typical voters across the country			1
any good politician knows this			0
the state 's traditional blend of fiscal conservatism and social tolerance poses a tricky challenge for the seven @entity16 candidates onstage at @entity17			1
answers that win applause in @entity21 living rooms might not work as well in the @entity1			1
discussions of faith , now common in presidential debates , are important to most @entity16 voters in other early primary and caucus states			1
but religion is not as central to life in @entity1 , where social conservatives hold limited sway			1
a quarter of @entity33 go to church on a typical sunday , far below the national average			0
this state is one of the few where same - sex marriage is legal			0
in 2009 , when a @entity41 legislature and governor replaced civil unions with same - sex marriage , many local @entity16 were angry			0
despite a sharp turn to the right in both the @entity47 and @entity48 in the 2010 elections , quick reversal of the new law has not become a top @entity16 priority			0
according to a @entity54 poll in february , 37 % of @entity16 strongly support repeal			0
ending same - sex marriage is extremely important to just 5 % of the state 's voters			1
as a result , questions asked monday night about divisive social topics may get more attention along @entity63 , @entity64 , than on @entity65			1
other issues are more important here			2
@entity1 's reputation as a conservative @entity16 stronghold is well - deserved			1
the state 's most influential modern governor , @entity69 , left a tight - fisted legacy of small government that endures more than three decades later			2
his populist slogan , " ax the tax , " ensured that the sales and income taxes accepted in most states would remain political poison here for decades			0
in november , a new populist wave arrived			0
@entity82 insurgents won scores of state legislative seats			0
the activists then overwhelmed the @entity16 establishment , electing allies as @entity47 speaker and state party chairman			2
in this new political climate , issues that matter to libertarians , strict constitutionalists and fiscal conservatives are moving to center stage			2
past attempts to weaken unions went nowhere			0
but labor now has few @entity16 friends in @entity1			1
a controversial right - to - work bill , which would make most union membership voluntary , may be passed over @entity41 gov. @entity103 's veto			2
limitations on government are important to many of these new activists			1
many embrace the 10th amendment , which they see as essential protection against a too - powerful federal government			2
they have no use for " compassionate conservativism , " which they see as nothing but big , intrusive bureaucracy			0
eminent domain is another government power distrusted by many of these new conservative activists			1
a controversial power line proposal that depended on state confiscation of rural land already faced broad opposition , but the new activists ' votes may prove decisive in blocking the project			0
questions that touch on some of these issues may seem unusual elsewhere , but not here			0
the answers will have real impact as @entity1 's republicans and independents begin studying the field			1
to avoid stumbling here , candidates must remember that the @entity1 is changing but it remains unique			1
treating its voters like @entity139 would be as foolish as confusing ethanol with maple syrup .			0

answers that win applause in @entity21 living rooms might not work as well in @entity1
religion is *n't* as central to life in @entity1 , where social conservatives hold limited sway
