-- there 's a classic rap song from the early 1990s called " @entity3 " where @entity4 chronicles 24 hours of peace and happiness on the otherwise rough and dangerous streets of @entity8			1
twenty - four hours when he did n't have to shoot his @entity10			0
when he won a ton of money gambling			0
and when he had lots of sex			0
naturally , the only part of the song i can relate to is the fact that he ate breakfast			0
of course , @entity4 's " good day " was purely fictional			1
it 's just a song			2
and if you want to have a quick listen , my best advice is to wear headphones because it 's definitely not safe for work			2
( that said , mom , if you are at home , feel free to blast it loud and be all gangsta			0
) but what if this was real ? what if @entity4 really did have a good day			1
when might that have been ? the answer : january 20 , 1992			1
at least according to 28 - year - old stand - up - comedian @entity38			1
in early 2012 -- 20 years after the song was originally released -- @entity38 , with presumably nothing better to do between gigs , actually pinpointed this specific date by piecing together key facts from the lyrics			1
" it only took me 30 minutes , " he wrote me in an e-mail			0
" i did all the research on my @entity49 while i was upside down on my couch			0
" really , i 'm encouraged by his general lack of effort			0
@entity38 may or may not have burned an entire calorie while , once again , proving all good things in life can be accomplished in half an hour			1
@entity38 later posted his research on @entity58 where , perhaps , somebody would find a noble application for this otherwise completely useless information			1
and amazingly , because we are living in truly magical times , somebody actually did			0
a few weeks ago , four longtime friends got together and launched an online fundraising project based on @entity38 's research and @entity68			1
they 're calling it the @entity70			1
i spoke with two of the project creators , @entity72 and @entity74 , and they explained that their goal is to raise a bunch of money and then guilt - trip ( my words ) the @entity82 company into flying their iconic airship high in the sky on january 20 while spelling out in lights : @entity4 's a pimp			1
this , referencing key lyrics from the song : no helicopter looking for a murder / two in the morning , got the @entity92 / even saw the lights of the @entity82 / and it read " @entity4 's a @entity94			1
" basically , these guys want to make @entity4 's good day the best day			1
for everyone ! and , to do so , they 're aiming to raise at least $ 25,000 through @entity98 that they will then donate to the @entity8 charity , @entity101 , which works to provide a safe , positive , family environment for at - risk youth			0
but @entity82 must agree to fly the blimp and light up the sky with ice cube 's a pimp			1
essentially , it 's corporate extortion for a good cause			1
@entity74 told me they want to " rally the masses to donate money ... in hopes to put enough social pressure on @entity82			1
" he also added , " we would n't have put this much work into something like this if we did n't think there was at least some percentage of obtaining the goal			0
" but the @entity70 guys might not want to hold their breath			1
@entity82 explained to @entity0 that they " receive thousands of requests every year for our blimps			1
unfortunately , we are not able to accommodate all of these			0
however , we are proud of our long record of supporting charities over the past 40 years			0
" the company also said they would speak directly with @entity101 to find a way to support the organization			2
to be fair to @entity82 , they do have to be careful about setting a bad precedent			1
if you fly it for one organization , it 's difficult to say no to others			1
" hi , this is @entity139 from the @entity140			0
" but , in this specific case , the request does sort of have a very direct connection to the blimp			0
and if @entity82 decides to let this one happen , people just might understand			1
but there 's also the issue of the word " pimp			2
" it 's not necessarily profane , but it also is n't one of the key buzzwords that companies like to use publicly			2
( other words to avoid include : napalm , @entity157 , and gonads			0
) the point is this			0
when you 're flying a corporate blimp , displaying the word " @entity94 " is certainly a bit more taboo than , say , lighting up the sky with : " @entity164 , will you marry me ? " yet , decidedly less taboo than : " @entity165			0
" @entity72 acknowledges that even if they raise the $ 25k , it 's going to be tough to convince @entity82 to use the word " pimp			1
" he says , " that word is a point of contention for sure			0
but we want to remind people that good days do exist , and the best way to do that is with one big , grand gesture			2
" so what does @entity4 think of all this ? coincidentally , he just happened to be in the @entity177 in @entity178 this week , promoting his new movie " @entity180 " with @entity181			1
i caught up with him in the hallway and told him all about the project			0
" i think it 's dope , " he said			2
( @entity186 means " good , " mom			2
sort of like your meatloaf is totally dope ! ) " you know , i 've been trying to get ( @entity82 ) to do it for years , and now we have some real momentum behind it			1
" cube further endorsed the project by saying , " let 's try to get ' ice cube 's a pimp ' up on that blimp soon , man			2
donate ! put in your church money ! give everything ! " or just a little			0
all donations are welcome , but those who give $ 50 or more will receive a special limited edition " @entity70 " poster illustrated by the artist , @entity207			2
if they reach the money goal and @entity82 complies , that is			2
the project creators stressed that they will never actually touch the funds , and if everything goes according to plan , a place called home will get the money directly from @entity98			2
if it fails , donations will not be processed			0
so , it 's all or nothing			0
and nothing would be very un-dope			0
unlike my mom 's meatloaf			0
