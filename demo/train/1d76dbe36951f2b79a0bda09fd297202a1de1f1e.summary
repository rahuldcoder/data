@entity0 -- dark shadows were lifting themselves off the sidewalk , slowly stretching , shaking the slumber from their limbs			1
it was 6:15 a.m. in @entity0 's capital , @entity8 , and i was setting off on a 12 - hour drive , leaving its lush boulevards for @entity12 , the sands of the @entity14 , the desert trails to @entity16 , and the chaos @entity20 's war there is causing			1
the sun had yet to raise itself over the roofs but already the first hints of day were breaking the sleep of the destitute at the roadside			1
i have seen poverty before , but even shrouded in the predawn gray , there is no mistaking it : people with little of anything save a public place to lay their heads			1
despite tough lives , the people here are warm , welcoming and hospitable			1
" bonjour , " they say , hinting at their recent @entity39 colonial past			1
it seems to have overlaid , in part at least , their far earlier conversion to @entity44			1
" as - @entity47 , " the @entity46 greeting , is rarely used			1
long @entity39 loaves -- not @entity46 flatbread -- are on sale at tiny stalls			1
we 've already passed through the checkpoint on the outskirts of the capital before the countryside begins to take shape			1
gendarmes in what look like fading @entity39 military fatigues checked the car 's documents and a man in orange overalls took a few dollars ' road toll for the 950 kilometers , or 600 miles , we will drive			1
the rope blocking our way across the road was dropped and we were released onto a strangely empty highway			1
slowly the countryside began to show is colors			1
@entity72 shaded to blue , to a dark olive green			2
then in an instant the sun smothers everything , washing away the stains of the night			2
our journey lurches into gear , no longer feeling like we 're sluggishly passing anonymous vegetation			2
our momentum , at least in our minds , increases as we streak past the newly revealed rich green towering maize , the thickly leaved luxuriant trees			2
this land is green and fertile			2
everything is vibrant in a way @entity89 could truly appreciate			2
in the villages , strange , bulging , round mud buildings - like an oversize , slightly squashed rugby ball - mingle with mud and straw shacks			2
they have no door , only a scant straw roof : grain stores hinting at the bounty of the land			2
village after village , we pass them			2
the more there are , the bigger they are , the more grain is held and the more prosperous the people who own them			2
lest this give an illusion of wealth , consider this : most children we see are barefoot , and that 's almost half @entity0 's people			1
within a few hours of leaving the capital , none of the villages have electricity , running water , sanitation , a building that 's not made out of mud and straw			1
the slightly larger towns have slightly more			2
the farther we go , the villages become fewer and farther between			2
the muddy ponds , courtesy of the recent rains , shrink , and the striking longhorn cattle and goats jostle for a place to slake their thirst			1
the tarmac on the highway begins to break apart			2
we slam into potholes , lurching , juddering forward			2
the bright greens are gone , the vegetation paler and browner here			0
the great trees have shrunk to tiny shrubs			0
we are still 200 miles from @entity12			1
grass covers some of the land , the grain huts are long gone , and quickly so is the road			0
we are no longer dodging potholes , we are driving in one big long one			0
the cell phone service that has surprisingly kept us company so much of the journey has also disappeared			0
in over a hundred miles , we pass but two tiny towns			0
this is what it means to be remote , where the land and sun are so unforgiving none can live , and this is where the bonds that tie a nation together begin to fray			0
the crowds that gathered about the car with rounded faces we saw in the morning have by afternoon given way to the thinner , lighter features of the @entity172			0
those features are often hard to see , shrouded as they are by turbans that wrap around the face			0
by instinct , by life , by tradition , they are desert mountain people			0
twice in the past two decades , they 've risen up in armed rebellion against the government			0
some joined @entity20 's forces over the border in @entity16			1
the government in @entity8 worries @entity16 's war will create instability in @entity0			1
officials publicly say they fear @entity20 's weapon stockpiles could be falling into @entity194 's hands			1
privately there 's another fear , that the newly liberated guns could one day be turned on the government in another @entity172 rebellion			1
but for now a @entity172 rebellion seems the more distant possibility , because @entity201 is exploiting the @entity202 spring and every crumb of opportunity that might fall unnoticed from the battlefield			0
their drug - , gun - and people - smuggling routes through the sparsely populated land we are crossing are hungry for the sustenance turmoil can bring			0
the more confusion and chaos there is , the easier it is to keep their networks hidden			0
it is these last few miles to @entity12 that worry us the most			1
@entity194 has kidnapped several foreigners in this remote region in the past few years			1
we do n't want to be unlucky names added to the list			0
while our driver is holding up well , almost 12 hours at the wheel , our fuel light has been on for a while			0
we 've been running on reserve			0
he stops to top up the tank from a solitary liter bottle of fuel we purchased earlier in the day			0
there have been no milestones for a while and the sun is edging down to the dirt of the desert			0
we 're hoping @entity12 will soon come into view			1
how far can a four - wheel - drive off - road truck go on a liter of gas ? then we see a red - topped stone marker come into view			0
it reads 30 kilometers , 20 or so miles , to go			0
and not a soul around			0
we 're racing the sun , our dwindling fuel and our fears			0
each bend in the road i hope will be our last			0
can the red light on the fuel gauge be any brighter ? probably not ; it 's a trick of the fading light easily worked on tense , tired eyes			1
then , as if by clockwork , almost exactly 12 hours after we left @entity8 , @entity12 slips into view - low , dusty , dilapidated , but a delight to see			1
uniformed gendarmes and a man in orange overalls greet us at the checkpoint , lower the rope and wave , their job for the day almost done ; there can be few more drivers behind us			0
the litter - strewn streets are cluttered with vendors packing up their shabby wares			0
dust and smoke cloud the air , making it hard to see much of this town			0
with better light tomorrow we 'll get a good look at this place where @entity20 is rumored to have spent millions paving roads , putting up lights , even building a hospital			1
a few hours later as i settle in to my bed , i can only wonder at the irony			0
@entity20 is out there somewhere on the run , and i 'll be getting a good night 's sleep in the @entity12 hotel he built .			1

@entity0 's goverment worries @entity16 's war will destabilize the country
@entity194 has kidnapped several foreigners outside @entity12 in recent years
