@entity6 and @entity7 are heading upstream in a small boat on a jungle river , said @entity10 , @entity5 's minister of tourism and commerce			1
" they 're currently in a remote , paradise - like region of the @entity5 @entity15 , which is difficult to access , " he told @entity12			1
but even as authorities trumpeted the news , @entity7 's mother said in a statement that she wo n't believe it until she hears directly from her son			1
" we have not heard from them since january 25 , nor have they accessed bank accounts since that time , " mother @entity23 said			2
" we have only the worst to consider as to why			0
" the couple , who hail from the @entity30 area , left last november and began a series of social media posts chronicling the trip of their dreams -- a four - month bike adventure through @entity2			0
" will be riding my bike in other countries and out of contact for 4 months ! " @entity6 wrote in a november @entity41 post before flying with @entity7 to @entity42 , @entity43			1
but for weeks , the couple shared photos online from their trek through @entity43 , @entity47 and @entity5 , showing themselves posing beside their bikes on remote mountain roads , camping out in tents and smiling at the beach			1
in late january , however , their internet postings stopped and calls to their cell phones went unanswered			1
family members say no one has been able to get in touch with them since then			0
@entity60 said both the @entity62 @entity61 in @entity5 and the country 's interior ministry have called to say that @entity6 and @entity7 were spotted			1
but that 's not enough , she said			0
" let me reiterate , until we have @entity71 , we can not celebrate these rumors and sightings , " she wrote on a @entity41 page set up to facilitate a search for the couple			0
" proof of life is my son 's voice on the phone and a picture of him holding the missing poster			1
" @entity10 told @entity12 that the tourism ministry learned of the couple 's location from police , who received a report from a clinic in the town of @entity88 after sending out a nationwide alert about the missing couple			2
the ministry will send a hydroplane tomorrow to shoot video of the couple and provide proof they 're doing ok , he said			0
" they have no idea of the commotion they have caused in the media , " he said , " because they simply ca n't communicate with family from where they currently are			0
" @entity6 and @entity7 , both 25 , according to a family flyer , were last seen in @entity106 , the @entity5 capital			1
but some of the areas they planned to visit are out of cell phone and internet reach			1
the @entity111 earlier told @entity12 that the manager of a hostel in @entity114 , where the couple stayed , confirmed to a police investigator they reached the jungle city in early february			0
the manager of @entity120 , a small hotel in the rain forest city of @entity123 , told police the couple stayed there on february 16 and told him they planned to travel to the town of @entity129 , a 15 - day trek			2
@entity5 is known for the @entity132 ruins of @entity133 , located in the @entity134 , which attract hundreds of thousands of international travelers each year			2
two weeks ago , the @entity62 @entity61 in @entity106 issued a security message warning @entity62 of " a potential kidnapping threat in the @entity134 area			0
" " @entity61 has received information that members of a criminal organization may be planning to kidnap @entity62 citizen tourists in the @entity134 and @entity133 area , " the message said			0

" @entity5 's tourism minister said tuesday that he was " deeply concerned " about the negative impact of reports of the missing @entity2 couple			1
the reason the couple has been out of touch for so long has nothing to do with any crime , he said			0
" these two young people have fallen in love with @entity5 , " @entity10 said			2
" they have visited off - the - beaten - path places and it seems like they 're having a blast -- so much so that they have forgotten to communicate with their families			0
