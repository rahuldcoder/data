, there 's a 200 % chance that you 've seen the network 's " i love the ... " series , which also means that you 've stumbled upon comedian @entity10 waxing nostalgic on everything from @entity13 footballs to the @entity15 sex tape			1
( " i love the 70 's " and " @entity17 , " respectively			2
) as a regular contributor to the series , it seems as though @entity10 pretty much loved every decade , and everyone seemed to love @entity10			1
in fact , in 1999 the budding comedian received his big break on tv when the @entity28 network pegged him to host " @entity29 , " a show that aired the best clips from the previous day 's daily talk shows ( read : people getting naked on " @entity34 " )			1
@entity35 says , " i learned a lot more about the audience -- the @entity39 problem we have as a culture right now			2
' @entity42 ' is just kind of the chubby , redneck version of throwing @entity44 to the lions			0
" shortly after taking over " @entity29 , " @entity35 landed a role on the @entity48 series " @entity51 " and numerous other parts on various networks			1
basically , the guy started to show up just about everywhere , including big - screen appearances in " @entity54 : @entity56 , " " @entity55 " and as the cult leader @entity58 in " @entity57 ? " ( @entity58 : " soon we will leave this lame planet and fly through outer space with cool aliens who like us ! " ) but if you have n't seen him on tv or in film , there 's also a chance you 've seen him on stage , singing and playing guitar for the band @entity70			1
or , perhaps , he beat you up in a kung fu fight			0
( seriously , @entity10 has a lot of hobbies			0
) a firm believer in the personal benefits of martial arts , @entity35 says , " if you take anything i say with any seriousness whatsoever , go study @entity80 tai chi			0
it will make you live longer			0
" apparently , the fountain of youth is n't bacon .			0

@entity10 is known for is commentary on @entity3 's " i love the ... " series
in 1999 , he hosted the @entity28 show " @entity29 , " which aired funny *segments* from talk shows
@entity35 also sings and plays the guitar in a band called @entity70
