in the poor suburbs of @entity3 , @entity4 's largest city , home - grown hip - hop artists blare from radios , clubs and street corners around the clock			1
unlike the majority of their commercial @entity12 counterparts , these rappers do n't talk much about women , partying and luxury lifestyles ; but poverty , illiteracy , crime , and the high cost of living			2
according to a recent report from the @entity21 , nearly half of young @entity4 are either unemployed or out of school			2
for 28 - year - old rapper @entity24 , who goes by the stage name @entity26 , the situation reflects a growing inequality between @entity4 's rich and poor			1
indeed , his most popular song , " @entity29 " speaks directly of the wealth gap in @entity4 society			1
" they have croissant for breakfast while we eat bread dipped in cheap oil			0
they dine on grilled meat while we fight over an ounce of meat like worms , " he sings			0
" why did i write ' @entity44 ? ' look around where i live and you 'll understand why i wrote it			0
to say it simply : here in @entity4 the people who have power , they can do what they want , say what they want , and no one will judge them or say anything to them , " he said			2
as a child @entity26 listened to @entity56 and was inspired to write his own music			1
he says he could n't afford to buy a guitar so his words became his instrument , and he started rapping at 15			0
" i expressed my feelings about things i lived through , the things that hurt me , the life experiences that marked me , " he said			0
internet penetration in @entity4 has increased from just 15 % of the population in 2007 , to 49 % in 2011 , according to @entity67			1
as such , the country 's rap and hip - hop scene has exploded in popularity in urban centers -- where internet access is highest -- as home - grown artists take advantage of the ability to share and distribute their productions more widely			1
national festivals such as @entity3 's @entity80 and capital city @entity81 increasingly showcase the talents of both domestic and international musicians , including the likes of @entity86 and @entity87			0
now a stalwart on the scene , @entity26 gained fame with the rap group @entity91 , making enough money from concerts and touring to move out of his run - down neighbourhood in @entity3			1
he still returns regularly , and is regarded as a local success story and inspiration			0
" i listen to rap and fusion music , but mostly rap , and especially @entity26 because he 's from this neighborhood , " said a local man			1
" i 'm 19 and i 'm a rapper			0
i think hip - hop is a way to express ourselves			1
i think it can change a lot of things , " said another			0
but that change can come at a price			0
in february of last year , as the @entity111 swept across the region , pro-reform protests erupted across @entity4			2
@entity4 's king , @entity114 , announced several reforms , including new parliamentary elections , civic and social equality for women , and recognition of the indigenous @entity121 language as an official state language along with @entity123			1
but for many , especially among @entity4 's disenchanted young , it was n't enough			1
rapper @entity125 , better known as " @entity126 " ( " the @entity127 " ) , became a figurehead for the pro-reform february 20 movement when he was arrested in march 2011 for his song " @entity134 " or " @entity135 , " in which he criticizes the police for brutality and corruption			2
" you are paid to protect the citizens , not to steal their money , " read the lyrics			0
" did your commander order you to take money from the poor ? " the song asks the police to arrest the wealthy businessmen who , he says , have divided the country up for themselves			2
a @entity3 court sentenced @entity125 to one year in prison for hurting the image of the police			0
the conviction drew widespread criticism from @entity125 's supporters on both his website and on social media outlets , as well as condemnation from @entity159 , among others			2
for @entity162 , a @entity4 sociology professor , the discontentment expressed in the lyrics of @entity4 's growing band of hip hop artists is an inevitable product of the country 's lack of social unity : " the youth started suffering from unemployment , they started feeling marginalized and found it difficult to afford a dignified life or to establish themselves in society and so began to feel excluded , " he said			1
follow the @entity177 the @entity179 team on @entity180 : presenter @entity182 , producer @entity183 , producer @entity184 , writer @entity185 and digital producer @entity186 : @ mairicnn .			0
