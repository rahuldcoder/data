" minimize the effects apply moisturizer to temporarily rehydrate ( and plump up ) the skin			1

loss of elasticity as skin ages , the collagen and elastin fibers in the dermis break down , reducing skin 's ability to " snap back " from smiles and other facial expressions			1
exposure to sunlight accelerates this process , especially @entity50 rays , which penetrate deeper into the skin than @entity53 rays			2
minimize the effects wear broad - spectrum sunblock ( look for such ingredients as @entity57 , @entity58 and avobenzone ) , and apply an antioxidant cream daily			0

repetitive motion dynamic movements that cause the skin to repeatedly crease in the same place , such as smiling , will wear down the underlying tissue in that specific spot , creating a line that remains after muscles relax			1
minimize the effects smiling is essential , but you can limit other motions that deepen crow 's - feet			0
for example , wear sunglasses to keep from squinting in bright light			0

injectable fillers collagen and hyaluronic acid fillers ( like @entity91 ) can be injected directly into wrinkles to restore volume loss			1
collagen is thin and more viscous , making it easier to apply under thin eye skin			2
by contrast , hyaluronic acid , which is denser and lasts longer , is better suited for filling the nasolabial area ( the lines from mouth to nose )			2
primary area of use : @entity106 's feet and nasolabial folds costs : collagen : $ 250 -- $ 550 per area ; hyaluronic acid : $ 300 -- $ 850 per area lasts : collagen : 3 -- 4 months ; hyaluronic acid : 6 -- 12 months downtime : swelling can last 1 -- 2 days ; some slight redness			0
risks : @entity118 and bruising our experience : these deep injections hurt , but our tester saw immediate improvement in nasolabial folds			0
insider tip : if you get a bump , massage the area within 24 hours to smooth it out			0
@entity83 @entity139 toxin , aka @entity83 , " relaxes the muscles , so when you smile , the skin wo n't crinkle up in the area around your eyes , " says @entity131 dermatologist @entity130			1
limiting repetitive movements prevents the formation of wrinkles in those areas and lessens the appearance of existing lines			1
primary area of use : forehead , brow lines and crow 's - feet cost $ 200 -- $ 500 per area lasts : approximately 3 -- 4 months downtime : virtually none , but slight swelling ( that looks like a welt ) may last a few hours following the injection			2
risks : drooping of the eyelid or brow ( rare ) our experience : slightly painful			0
it takes three to four days for dynamic wrinkles ( that appear when you make facial expressions ) to disappear			2
insider tip : avoid blood thinners such as ibuprofen or aspirin before treatment ; they increase the risk of bruising			0

instant fix " anything you can do to hydrate your skin softens the appearance of fine lines , " says dermatologist @entity178 of @entity179 , @entity180			1
for spot treatment of wrinkles , a product with a thick , cushiony feel fills in cracks better than a thinner cream or serum			2
try : @entity195 / @entity194			0
long - term help nothing will turn back the clock or erase damage caused by sunbathing , but you can stimulate the production of new collagen to bolster the skin 's thickness and firmness			1
look for products with retinol ( like @entity208 ) or peptides ( like @entity210 )			0
