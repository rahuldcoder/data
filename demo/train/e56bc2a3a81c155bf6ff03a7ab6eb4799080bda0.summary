@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 opposition leaders received a major morale boost friday when a top @entity6 senator made a surprise visit to the rebel stronghold of @entity0 and urged greater @entity6 involvement in the bloody campaign to oust strongman @entity11			1
the visit from sen. @entity13 , @entity14 , came a day after the @entity6 said it was deploying predator drones to @entity1			1
@entity13 said the drones would increase @entity18 's capability in the war - torn @entity20 country , but not enough to make up a shortfall in assets needed to break a " significant degree of stalemate			2
" he said he was against @entity6 troops on the ground -- echoing @entity29 administration policy -- but argued that @entity31 powers need to do more to " facilitate " the delivery of weapons and training for the rebels			1
" we have prevented the worst outcome in @entity1 , " @entity13 told reporters			1
" now we need to increase our support so that the @entity1 people can achieve the only satisfactory outcome to this mass protest for universal rights -- the end of @entity11 's rule and the beginning of a peaceful and inclusive transition to democracy that will benefit all @entity1			1
" @entity13 , the top @entity49 on the @entity50 , is a former presidential nominee and decorated @entity52 veteran			0
the five - term senator is considered a senior congressional spokesman on military and foreign policy matters			1
@entity13 is the highest - ranking @entity6 official to visit @entity1 since the conflict erupted in february			1
during his visit , he challenged critics of @entity18 's intervention to tour @entity0 and see a " powerful and hopeful example of what a free @entity1 can be			1
" the senator was greeted by a crowd of roughly 100 @entity1 waving @entity6 flags			1
" thank you @entity13 ! thank you @entity29 , " people chanted			1
" thank you @entity6 ! we need freedom ! @entity11 go away ! " @entity13 visited @entity0 's @entity69 , accompanied by , among others , @entity71 , deputy chairman of the opposition @entity72			1
he paused at a courthouse wall covered with scores of pictures of people allegedly killed by @entity11 's forces and others who have gone missing since uprisings began			0
" the @entity6 people support you very strongly , and we know it 's necessary to help as much as we can , " @entity13 told a woman who thanked him for @entity6 support			2
as @entity13 met with the rebels , miles away in western @entity1 , a fierce battle continued to rage for control of @entity89 , the country 's third - largest city			2
@entity89 has been under siege for seven weeks by @entity11 loyalists			0
" let 's face it			0
this is not a fair fight , " @entity13 asserted			0
" maybe we should be doing everything we can to help these people and maybe we 're not , and they 're dying			0
" while @entity13 insisted he would not have gone to @entity1 without the backing of the @entity103 , a top @entity101 analyst told @entity2 the senator 's trip would increase the pressure on president @entity29 to step up @entity6 involvement			1
@entity13 " brings more limelight to the rebels , " said @entity108 , a @entity101 scholar with the @entity109 , a conservative @entity110 think tank			0
" his visit forces some @entity6 officials to reconsider their assessment of the rebels			2
" " the fact that @entity13 was able to conduct this meeting shows a modicum of organization ( among the rebels ) and also raises the question : if @entity13 can meet the people for whom we are fighting , why not secretary of state @entity126 ? why not vice president @entity127 ? " if @entity13 returns to @entity129 and demands formal recognition of the rebel government as the legitimate representative of the @entity1 people , it is certain to shift the debate on @entity6 diplomatic posture , @entity108 said			1
if all opponents of the intervention " have done is sit back comfortably in @entity110 , it will be harder for them to drum up moral authority to back their arguments , " he noted			0
asked by @entity2 to define the @entity6 end game in @entity1 , @entity13 said he envisions " a departure of @entity11 and the @entity1 people being able to set up a government by themselves , with the assistance primarily of the @entity147 but also the @entity6			1
" " @entity1 is much closer to @entity147 , and @entity147 have greater ties to @entity1 and greater interests , " @entity13 noted			2
the @entity150 has sanctioned military action only to protect civilians			0
both @entity6 and @entity147 leaders , however , have repeatedly stated that their political goal is the ouster of @entity11			2
what would the @entity11 's departure mean ? " it means one of three things , " @entity13 said			2
" he joins @entity161 in @entity162 or he goes to @entity163 , which is my preference , or he joins @entity166 and @entity167			0
" the senator noted that rebel leaders have insisted @entity11 step down from power , significantly reducing the chances for a political settlement			0
when @entity11 's forces were outside @entity0 , the dictator said he " was going to go house to house and kill every person that he could , " @entity13 added			1
" there is no doubt what col. @entity11 will do to his own people if he has the opportunity			0
... that 's not a settlement			0
" @entity13 defended the track record of predator drones in @entity189 and @entity190 , arguing that their use has only resulted in civilian deaths when targets have been misidentified			0
contacted by @entity2 , @entity13 's office declined to state how the senator 's surprise trip was funded			0
@entity2 's @entity198 , @entity199 , and @entity200 contributed to this report			0
