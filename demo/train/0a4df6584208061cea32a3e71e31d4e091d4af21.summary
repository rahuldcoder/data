@entity0 -- a @entity3 judge friday dismissed an emergency motion filed by the ex-wife of music mogul @entity6 seeking temporary custody of their son			1
the judge ruled that even though the 5 - year - old child was injured in a swimming pool accident this week , it was not an emergency or crisis situation requiring that @entity6 's two children be taken from him			1
the child , @entity17 , remains hospitalized but is doing " much better , " his mother posted on @entity18			0
" what happened here was an awful accident and ... i 'm not certain that had any single person been at the poolside that one person could have done any better than ms. @entity27			0
and ms. @entity27 did impress me as a capable caregiver , " @entity29 superior court judge @entity28 said , referring to the boy 's aunt , @entity27 , who was caring for the child at the time of the accident			1
" based on the evidence i heard , not one person could have done any better than ms. @entity27 , " the judge added			2
the judge then addressed @entity6 's ex-wife , @entity38 : " your standards for caregivers are rather high , " @entity28 said , pointing out that most people have been watched by a grandmother or aunt			1
the judge instructed @entity6 to keep his ex-wife informed about his whereabouts and who 's taking care of their two children			1
at friday 's emergency custody hearing in @entity0 , @entity6 , as he is known in his career as a singer and actor , testified that he waited an hour to inform his ex-wife that their son had nearly drowned in a swimming pool accident because " the first thing to do was to respond to the emergency ... my son was hysterical and in the back of an ambulance			1
" his ex-wife testified earlier that she does not trust the childcare of @entity6 's aunt who was present when their son fell into the pool			1
@entity38 also said @entity6 does not keep her informed about who is taking of their children or the doings in the children 's lives			1
" they come home with bags of medicine			0
i do n't know why or what illness or who 's taking them to the doctor ... he does n't confer with me regarding anything , nothing , " she told the court			2
@entity38 became extremely emotional after the 911 call made by @entity6 's aunt was played in court			1
" i do n't know if my son is going to have a brain defect			0
i do n't know if his heart is operating correctly			0
i do n't know if my son 's going to be 100 % the boy he was before this incident , " @entity38 said			2
@entity38 said @entity6 's aunt is incapable of keeping up with the two children			1
in reference to their other son jumping into the pool to help @entity97 , @entity38 testified : " he ca n't even swim , he was trying to save his brother			0
that 's chaos , that is chaos , that 's chaos			1
" she kept repeating " that 's chaos " as she wiped her eyes , and the judge told her to get off the stand			1
@entity6 testified he 's notified @entity38 on several occasions about changes to the children 's caregivers , contrary to her earlier claims			1
he also said he 's scheduled to be in @entity0 for the remainder of august			2
the children 's activities are outlined in a weekly e-mail , according to @entity6			1
he said he tells @entity38 about doctors ' visits , summer camps , or travel , including the aliases used to book hotel rooms , in the rare event he travels with the kids			2
when one attorney tried asking why @entity6 does n't update @entity38 on his travel plans , the judge jumped in : " an emergency means life and death -- that these kids are in danger and need to be somewhere else			2
" the judge told the attorney to move on with her questions			2
at another point in testimony , the aunt took the stand			0
@entity135 said she 's disabled because of her back , but she can swim and attends therapy sessions in water			0
the aunt also said she knows cpr , or cardiopulmonary resuscitation , though she needs to be recertified			0
when asked by @entity38 's attorney if she can pick up more than 25 pounds , @entity135 said : " sometimes , it just depends on how my back is feeling			0
" i know how to take care of children , " @entity135 added			2
five - year - old @entity17 is recovering from monday 's accident at @entity148 , according to the lawyer for @entity38			0
a breathing tube inserted after the accident has since been removed , attorney @entity150 told @entity1			0
@entity6 , won primary custody of the couple 's two children , @entity156 and 4 - year - old @entity157 , last year after a bitter court fight in which @entity38 accused the singer of being an absentee father			1
@entity38 filed in may for a custody modification			0
that case had n't been heard by the time the swimming pool accident happened monday , so @entity38 filed tuesday for an emergency hearing on the matter			0
timeline : @entity167 @entity6 's former stepson , also @entity38 's son , died in a watercraft accident on a north @entity3 lake last year			1
