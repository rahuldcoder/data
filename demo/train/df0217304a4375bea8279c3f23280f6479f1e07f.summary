@entity0 -- with a simple , declarative statement , the head of the @entity3 announced his ambitious goal to eradicate one of the country 's most shameful problems			2
" my name is @entity9 , and i am here to end veteran homelessness , " va secretary @entity9 said tuesday in a speech to the @entity11			1
but @entity9 indicated the challenge in meeting his goal by adding , " i learned long ago there are never any absolutes in life , and a goal of zero homeless veterans sure sounds like an absolute			1
" the plan unveiled by @entity9 includes trying to leverage existing education and jobs programs , boosting the ability of veteran - owned businesses to compete for federal contracts and spend an additional $ 3 billion on medical services and homeless programs			1
an estimated 131,000 veterans are homeless , according to the @entity3			1
that is an improvement from 2003 , when the number was as high as 196,000			0
but the secretary warned that given the ailing economy , the number could increase by as much as 10 percent to 15 percent in the next five years			0
the @entity3 plans to focus its new efforts on preventing the problem			2
" our plan enlarges the scope of @entity3 's efforts to combat homelessness , " said @entity9 in a news release			1
" in the past , @entity3 focused largely on getting homeless veterans off the streets			1
our five - year plan aims also at preventing them from ever ending up homeless			0
" the department plans to expand the recently passed educational grants program for veterans who served after september 11 , 2001 , to include not just college but vocational programs as well , according to @entity3 spokeswoman @entity55			2
" not every veteran wants to spend four years pursuing a college degree , but they might be interested in learning a trade that would get them into the taxpaying work force sooner , " @entity9 said			2
the @entity3 will also try to win more federal contracts for veteran - owned businesses , encouraging other agencies to exceed the minimum goal of 3 percent of contracts to veteran - owned small businesses			2
the increase , the @entity3 believes , will also help employ more veterans since " veterans hire veterans , " @entity9 said			1
in addition , it is increasing the amount of vouchers for public - financed housing , adding 10,000 more vouchers in 2010			0
the plan also calls for more programs to aid transition from prison and psychiatric facilities , as well as a renewed call to treat veterans ' psychiatric conditions			0
read more about the @entity3 's ambitious goal veterans ' groups contacted after the speech were generally pleased that the secretary was focusing the attention but unsure how he would achieve such an ambitious goal			1
" @entity9 is a soldier and treating this like a military operation and in the military you have to have hope for your missions , " said @entity93 of @entity94			0
@entity9 was a four - star general in the @entity101			0
@entity93 said he thought @entity9 's aim to get better coordination between the @entity3 and federal departments , including @entity105 and @entity106 , was a good start			1
but others were more pessimistic that @entity9 could change the @entity3 bureaucracy			1
" this secretary is going to be a good leader , but we do n't think he or the president has quite gotten a hold of how intractable the bureaucracy is inside the @entity3 , " said @entity110 , executive director for policy and government affairs at @entity113			1
@entity110 said one problem not mentioned tuesday that would help , more than many of of the other programs , is reducing the backlog in processing veterans ' claims that delays much - needed medical and other benefits			2
the @entity3 recognizes backlogs are a problem , said spokeswoman @entity55			1
" the backlog is a top priority at the @entity3 and at the forefront of the secretary 's mind , " she said			2
@entity136 at the @entity138 organization @entity137 said the announcement tuesday showed that @entity9 had " real leadership , " but she worried that lack of funds and leadership at the local level would make instituting change difficult			0
the problem , she said , is sometimes not in the @entity3 's control			0
@entity136 said her group 's center , which helps 700 homeless veterans a year gain employment , housing and proper medical and psychiatric care in a residential setting , has lost a lot of money because of state budget cuts			0
the county cut the center 's mental health funding by 55 percent , which is a " significant " amount , @entity136 said			0
efforts to expand have been met with opposition , as in the case of a seven - year effort in @entity167 's @entity166 to build a new treatment center that has been opposed by local communities			0
" the va was behind it , but the neighbors do n't want those people in their neighborhood , " @entity136 explained .			0
