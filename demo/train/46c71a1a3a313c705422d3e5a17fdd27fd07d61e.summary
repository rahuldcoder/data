second , we look at the failure of universal background checks to pass the @entity14 despite the support of nearly 90 % of @entity16			1

on a much lighter note , we decided to take on @entity19 's visit to the @entity64 in @entity65 , inspired by an excellent column @entity4 wrote for @entity0			1
