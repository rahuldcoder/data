the @entity34 denies any wrongdoing			0
" the district did not violate @entity12 's civil rights , and disputes the one - sided version of events set forth in the complaint written by the @entity2 , " according to a district statement			2
according to the complaint , @entity12 felt that one of the school 's adult hall monitors was picking on her , so she wrote on her @entity8 " wall " that she hated that person because she was mean			2
the message was not posted from school property or using any school equipment or connections , the lawsuit states			1
somehow , the school principal got a hold of a screenshot of the message , and punished @entity12 with detention and made her apologize to the hall monitor , the complaint says			0
she was in trouble again shortly thereafter for another @entity8 post , which asked who turned her in , using an expletive for effect , the lawsuit says			0
she was given in school suspension and missed a class ski trip			0
in the third incident , according to the complaint , @entity12 was called in by school officials after the guardian of another student complained that @entity12 had had a conversation about sex on @entity8			0

there , she was " intimidated " into giving up her login and passwords to her @entity8 and e-mail accounts , the lawsuit says			0
" @entity12 was extremely nervous and being called out of class and being interrogated , " the lawsuit says			0
the officials did not have permission from @entity12 's mother to view her private communications , and they gave the girl a hard time about some of the material they discovered , the lawsuit states			1
" students do not shed their first amendment rights at the school house gate , " @entity96 , executive director for the @entity2 in @entity4 , said in a statement			1
