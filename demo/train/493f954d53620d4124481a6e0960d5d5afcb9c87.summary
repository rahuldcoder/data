-- the trial of @entity2 , who has admitted killing 77 people in a bomb and gun rampage in @entity6 last summer , is under way in @entity8			1
in a new courtroom specially built in the @entity6 capital for the trial , judges will consider whether @entity2 was insane at the time of the killings , and whether he should be sent to prison or a mental facility for his crimes			1
what is @entity2 charged with ? the 33 - year - old @entity6 man is facing charges of voluntary homicide and committing acts of terror			2
he is accused of setting off a bomb in central @entity8 that killed eight people , then fatally shooting 69 people at a youth camp run by the ruling @entity28 on nearby @entity29 on july 22 , 2011			2
who decides @entity2 's fate ? the current trial is in front of what is called the court of first instance , says @entity36 , professor of law at the @entity38			1
the court has no jury , but is instead made up of two professional judges and three " lay judges " -- members of the public that are chosen for the case just as members of a traditional jury would be -- that have the same powers as the professional judges do			0
in this court of first instance , the five judges will hear @entity2 's case , decide whether he is guilty or not , and if he is found guilty they will also sentence him			1
@entity2 then has a right to appeal the decision to a higher court			0
if @entity2 's appeal relates to the question of guilt , a court comprised of 10 jurors and moderated by three professional judges will oversee the new trial			1
seven guilty votes are required to convict in an appellate court			0
if a guilty verdict is reached , the three professional judges will join four members of the jury to decide on sentencing			0
the case can then be appealed to the @entity72 of @entity6			0
however , the jury 's evaluation of the evidence for his guilt is final			0
the case can then be appealed to the @entity72 of @entity6			0
what will happen during the trial ? @entity2 's trial in front of the court of first instance is expected to take up to 10 weeks			1
both the prosecution and defense are expected to call dozens of witnesses to the stand , and a verdict is not expected until weeks after the trial 's conclusion			2
the opening proceedings of the trial monday were televised on @entity6 television , streamed around the world and beamed via video link to 17 other courthouses across the country , where many of the bereaved sat watching			2
@entity2 was allowed to read a prepared statement in court on tuesday , but presiding judge @entity101 ruled that his testimony would not be broadcast -- rejecting his claim that airing it was a human right			0

" i think the case is being aired because of the large public interest , " he told @entity0			0
" we have n't had any comparable case like this since the age of television started			0
" could @entity2 be jailed for life ? the court has two options if @entity2 is convicted , says @entity36 , and it depends on whether the court finds he was either sane or insane at the time of the killings			1
in november , prosecutors said psychiatrists had determined that @entity2 was paranoid and schizophrenic at the time of the attacks and during 13 interviews experts conducted with him afterward			0
but in a report released in april , two court - appointed psychiatric experts said @entity2 was sane at the time of the killings			1
the decision on @entity2 's sanity ultimately rests with the courts -- and while the maximum sentence for homicide or terror acts is 21 years , @entity36 says there are two ways the @entity6 courts can keep @entity2 under state custody well past his initial jail sentence			1
if @entity2 is found to be sane , the court could sentence him to the traditional 21 - year prison sentence , the maximum term for a homicide or terror act conviction , but he must be released after serving that sentence			1
but the court could also sentence @entity2 under a provision called " preventive detention , " which also has a maximum of 21 years but can be prolonged in five year increments after that -- which means the court can detain @entity2 indefinitely after his sentence if he is found to be a continued threat to the public			2
if the court finds @entity2 insane , he can not be sentenced to prison or preventive detention , but can be confined to a psychiatric institution for the rest of his life , pending reviews of his mental state by the court every three years			1
the prosecution will argue that @entity2 was insane at the time of the attack , according to @entity0 's @entity175			1
a verdict of insane would allow @entity2 to be placed in this involuntary psychiatric treatment , which means he will receive a sentence ( of less than 21 years ) that can then be extended indefinitely for three - year periods pending an evaluation of his threat to the public			2
the death penalty is not an option -- @entity6 banned the peacetime practice of it in 1905 , and @entity36 says no one has been executed since roughly 20 @entity6 war criminals were put to death following @entity190 @entity2 's defense will try to prove he was sane at the time of the killings , his lawyers have said			1
has anyone ever been jailed for life in @entity6 ? while people may have been remanded to psychiatric wards indefinitely following crimes , @entity36 says no one has ever been detained indefinitely under preventive detention until their death because the law has only existed in its current form for roughly a decade			0
how likely is it @entity2 will ever be freed from state custody ? while it is too early to tell how people will feel about @entity2 as a threat to public safety in 20 years , @entity36 believes @entity2 will walk free one day if he 's determined to be sane by the courts			1
" i think he will get out at some point , unless it comes up that he is really insane and will be for the rest of his life , " he told @entity0			0
" i do n't know if he 's insane -- what we know from the past is that it 's not uncommon for criminals that acted from a political motivation to change their ideology and beliefs as they get older , and they think differently about the things that brought them to commit these crimes , and then their danger to society becomes reduced			0
" @entity230 and @entity0 's @entity175 contributed to this report .			0
