-- the @entity2 psychiatrist accused of the 2009 @entity4 shooting told the military judge his @entity7 faith requires him to wear a beard , marking the first time maj. @entity9 has made a statement in court			1
" your honor , in the name of almighty @entity13 , i am a @entity7 , " @entity9 said			1
" i believe that my religion requires me to wear a beard			0
" @entity9 made the statement after the presiding judge , col. @entity19 , asked why he was still in contempt of court -- in other words , why @entity9 had n't shaved his beard , which is against @entity2 regulations			1
" i am not trying to disrespect your authority as a military a judge			0
and i am not trying to disrupt the proceedings or the decorum of the court , " he said			0
" when i stand before @entity30 i am individually responsible for my actions			0
" @entity19 has threatened to have @entity9 forcibly shaved , previously citing the regulations and the right to ensure " that a military trial proceeds without a distracting and disruptive sideshow			1
" @entity9 was found in contempt of court again thursday , fined $ 1,000 and sent from the court to a trailer where @entity9 watched the rest of the proceedings via closed circuit tv			1
a hearing has been scheduled for thursday , september 6 , to discuss whether @entity9 's religious claims would prevent him from being shaved			1
@entity9 's court martial was scheduled to start last week at @entity4 , in @entity45 , @entity46 , where he is accused of killing 13 people and wounding 32			2
the trial was delayed when @entity9 's legal team petitioned the @entity50 to prevent @entity19 from ordering @entity9 's facial hair shaved			1
the @entity50 found that @entity9 's petition was " premature " because @entity19 had not yet issued a definitive order			2
if an official order was given , the appeals court said , @entity9 could file another petition			2
the beard issue surfaced in june , when @entity9 , who remains in the @entity2 while awaiting trial , appeared at a hearing with the beard			1
@entity19 postponed that hearing , then found @entity9 in contempt of court at a july hearing , fined him $ 1,000 and warned him he would be shaved by force unless he got rid of the beard			1
@entity9 had been expected to enter a plea during a previous hearing , but the proceedings were halted by the appellate court			2
@entity9 has previously expressed interest in pleading guilty , but military regulations bar a judge from accepting a guilty plea in a capital case			1
@entity9 is accused of opening fire at the post 's processing center , where soldiers were preparing to deploy to @entity79 and @entity80 , in november 2009			2
he faces a possible death sentence if convicted			0
he was paralyzed from the waist down in the shooting , when police officers exchanged fire with him			0
@entity9 , a @entity86 - born citizen of @entity88 descent , was a licensed psychiatrist who joined the @entity2 in 1997			1
he had been scheduled to deploy to @entity79 before the killings , but had been telling his family since 2001 that he wanted to get out of the military			0
he is a muslim who had told his family he had been taunted after the terrorist attacks of september 11 , 2001			0
investigations that followed the killings found he had been communicating via e-mail with @entity98 , the @entity99 - @entity86 radical cleric killed by a @entity86 drone attack in 2011			0
an @entity102 report in july found that a @entity103 in @entity104 that was investigating @entity98 passed two of the messages to another task force in the @entity109 area , where @entity9 was living at the time			2
the report found those e-mails should have been given to the @entity112 , but the @entity102 saw no evidence of terrorist activities in his case , and believed the information in the e-mails was too sensitive to share			0
it noted that visiting extremist websites is not grounds for taking action			0
@entity102 official : @entity9 should have been interviewed on e-mails with radical cleric			0
