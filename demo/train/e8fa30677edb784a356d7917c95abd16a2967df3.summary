-- citing fears of genocide , representatives of of humanitarian organizations tried thursday to focus @entity8 lawmakers ' attention on the @entity9 , where the situation is on the verge of exploding into a " decades - long conflict , " one aid group said			1
@entity13 believes " right now is the time to act , and we are asking @entity15 to make smart , forward - thinking decisions , " said @entity17 , a policy adviser to the group , in a telephone interview prior to addressing the @entity20 on @entity21 , @entity22			2
the group fears " that the current crisis in @entity25 is on the verge of metastasizing into a new , decades - long conflict , " she added			2
the landlocked country , which is bordered by @entity29 , @entity30 , @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , and the @entity33 , has seen nearly constant chaos for a year , since militant rebels removed the president from office and then lost power themselves			1
even before that , frail governments and poverty plagued its population			2
@entity17 cited five priorities for car : -- restoring security ; -- increasing support for peace - building initiatives ; -- meeting immediate humanitarian needs ; -- targeting interventions to protect and empower women and girls ; -- investing resources to transition to state - building and economic recovery			1
5 coups d'etat since independence the roots of the conflict date back to @entity25 's independence from @entity58 in 1960			1
since then , " it 's had weak governance , chronic insecurity , five coups d'etat , " @entity17 said			1
" people have only known violent and oppressive rule			2
@entity25 's never really enjoyed a legitimate , civilian administration			1
" throughout , the country 's 5.2 million residents have endured chronic , abject poverty			1
that underdevelopment has fomented deep distrust among civilians -- whose median age is 19 years			0
that distrust erupted into violence and the country descended into chaos in march 2013 , after a coalition of mostly @entity77 rebels known as @entity78 ousted president @entity79			1
they have since been forced from power , but @entity83 and @entity77 militias have continued to battle for control			1
to counter attacks on @entity83 communities by @entity78 groups , vigilante @entity83 groups known as the anti-balaka , which translates to " anti-machete , " fought back			1
@entity77 represented 15 % of the population , and @entity91 were 50 % , according to the @entity92			1
the groups have morphed into criminal gangs " that are seizing this opportunity to enrich themselves and to take revenge , " said @entity98 , a field researcher for the @entity99 , prior to his own testimony to the subcommittee			1
battle for resources , not religion " the most important thing is that people start to understand that this is not necessarily a conflict of @entity91 versus @entity77 , but it 's about natural resources " and competition for control of the states , he said			1
" it 's those classic issues that need to be tackled			1
" he called for the @entity115 to send mediators to work with interim president @entity117 to begin a political process " with local dialogues and reconciliation across the country			1
" in a report issued thursday by his project , @entity98 said @entity78 leaders were linked to @entity30 and @entity31 government - backed armed groups , mercenaries , poachers and diamond traders			1
" the research reveals that revenues from diamonds and elephant ivory are funding @entity78 and other fighters in @entity25 , enabling them to purchase weapons , fuel , and poaching equipment , " he said			1
" diamonds mined in @entity25 are sold to traders in the @entity141 region of @entity31 , as well as @entity30 , @entity29 , and the @entity33			1
" the traders circumvent the international certification process and likely sell their wares on the world market , he added			1
at least 2,000 people have died in the fighting , and 2.2 million others -- about half the country 's population -- need humanitarian aid , according to the @entity115			1
the world body this week appointed @entity153 of @entity154 to lead the @entity115 's political office charged with preventing conflict in the region			2
he faces a big job : more than 650,000 residents are internally displaced , and nearly 300,000 have fled to neighboring countries			0
@entity161 : ' do not repeat the mistakes of the past ' " there 's no one that really has any power to stop this , " said @entity98 , who recently spent a month in the country			1
" it was an almost surreal experience , " he said about his visit , most of which was in the capital city of @entity173 , where more than 200,000 residents are displaced , many of them living at the airport or in churches			0
" you could have people going to church and the markets were open and then , in the distance , you could hear shootings , " he said			0
" almost every night , we could hear shootings around town			0
" the poverty extends to the government , which did not pay its employees for six months , he said			0
the continuing violence has raised the specter of genocide , as occurred 20 years ago in @entity194			0
" do not repeat the mistakes of the past -- heed the lessons , " @entity115 @entity195 ban ki - moon said last month during a visit to the country			2
" most members of the @entity77 minority have fled			1
muslims and @entity91 have been placed in mortal danger simply because of who they are or what they believe , " @entity161 said			0
" people have been lynched and decapitated			0
sexual violence is on the rise			0
gruesome acts have been committed while others cheered on the perpetrators			0
there has been total impunity -- zero accountability			0
" international peacekeeping efforts are under way : some 6,000 @entity220 troops and 2,000 @entity58 forces are operating in the country , as is the first contingent of 1,600 @entity225 troops			2
in addition , the @entity115 has promised as many as 10,000 military personnel by september 15			0
more peacekeepers may not be enough but @entity13 ' @entity17 said it was not clear that they would suffice			0
the @entity220 forces need help , she said			0
" they do n't know what 's going on , they do n't have good intelligence , and they 're not good at communicating with the population , " she said			2
" it 's making the community more fearful , particularly vulnerable populations			2
" she said she was hopeful that @entity8 lawmakers would act " to address the underlying issues that caused this crisis in the first place			0
" thursday 's appeal to lawmakers is an attempt to give them the big picture about what is happening in @entity25			2
the @entity8 has already committed $ 150 million to the peacekeeping mission , but that effort requires at least another $ 100 million , said @entity253 chief operating officer @entity252			0
" the world stood by as nearly one million people were killed in @entity194 20 yrs ago , and we can not let the violence tear the social fabric of @entity25 , " he said			0
" we 've seen this over and over again in the way the international community responds to crises like these -- where we focus too narrowly on short - term , emergency needs and do n't take a step back to make long - term , strategic investments and decisions about how to solve the root problem			0
" and @entity25 faces another big challenge : the country has long been geopolitically insignificant to major donor countries			2
" so we , as a humanitarian and advocacy community , have an uphill battle to make the case as to why this is the smart decision now , " @entity17 said			0
" but i think it 's possible			2
" the challenges are immense			0
last week , 16 civilians -- including three national staff members of @entity281 -- were killed during a robbery on the grounds of a hospital in the northern town of @entity286 , said the group , which is also known as @entity281			0
@entity290 members surrounded the hospital grounds , where a meeting was taking place with community leaders invited by @entity281 to discuss medical access and care , the group said in a statement			0
" unprovoked , the men fired heavily into the crowd , killing and critically wounding meeting participants			0
" the incident led @entity281 to withdraw key staff , suspend activities in the town , where @entity77 fleeing violence had sought refuge , and reassess whether to continue operations elsewhere in @entity25			1
the incident reverberated among other humanitarian groups , but @entity310 's @entity309 for @entity9 @entity311 said he was planning to continue business as usual			1
" we remained during the crisis , and after the crisis we will remain , " he told @entity0 in a telephone interview from his office in @entity173 , where he has been working since 2012			0
schools have been closed in the country , so @entity310 has opened " temporary learning spaces " to carry on the teaching			1
and it has been providing chemicals to treat water nationwide , he said			0
in recent months , the number of @entity310 staff members has doubled , to more than 200 , though many of them work alongside security staff			1
still , he acknowledged , " there is some risk			2

since 1960 , " weak governance , chronic insecurity , 5 coups d'etat "
it 's not about @entity83 versus @entity77 , it 's about natural resources , one aid worker says
enough @entity99 links @entity78 to @entity30 and @entity31 groups , mercenaries , diamond traders
" there is some risk , " @entity310 country *director* says
