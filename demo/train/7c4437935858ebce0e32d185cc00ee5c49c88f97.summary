-- an extra time goal from @entity3 midfielder @entity2 ensured @entity5 side @entity4 won the last ever @entity7 final with a 2 - 1 victory over @entity10 side @entity9 in @entity11			1
@entity2 celebrates his winning goal as @entity4 became the final team to lift the @entity7			1
@entity2 's strike from 15 yards out lacked pace , but @entity9 goalkeeper @entity16 failed to save the shot and it slipped through his grasp to trickle over the line			1
however , there was to be drama in the final minyte of extra time when @entity9 striker @entity24 thought he had taken the final into a penalty shoot - out , but the goal was ruled out after the on - loan @entity28 forward was adjudged to have tugged back defender @entity29 before nudging the ball home			1
the victory means @entity34 's side become the first team from @entity5 to lift a major @entity37 trophy and gives eastern @entity37 a third @entity7 in five years after recent successes for @entity41 sides @entity39 and @entity42			1
next season the competition is being rebranded and renamed to become the @entity7			0
@entity4 were always the classier of the two sides and they should have gone ahead in the fifth minute when @entity45 was allowed the time and space to turn on the edge of the box , but he fired just wide with the goal gaping			2
he was almost made to pay a minute later as @entity4 failed to clear @entity52 's long throw but @entity53 miscued his effort			0
however , @entity45 made amends for his earlier miss in the 24th - minute when he seized on a through - ball that had wrong - footed the @entity9 defence and lifting a superb chip over the onrushing @entity16			2
moments after his goal , @entity45 found himself on the corner of the box again but lashed the ball over the bar , and his compatriot @entity66 then broke purposefully into the box , only to produce a tame finish straight at @entity16			0
but just as @entity4 were threatening to extend their advantage , @entity9 hit back through their own @entity3 , @entity70			1
the defender stepped up to take a 34th - minute free - kick , striking it so hard that goalkeeper @entity73 could only help it on its way into the net			0
at the other end , @entity16 looked more assured in denying @entity80 's powerful strike and the teams went in level at the end of an absorbing first half			0
@entity16 was back in action soon after the restart , doing well to punch away @entity88 's free - kick from the right and @entity2 's strike from the left			2
with the game petering out extra-time looked increasingly likely and once it got under way , it was almost inevitable that it would be an error that would finally settle the issue			0
less predictable was that @entity16 would be the culprit , horribly misjudging @entity2 's soft shot from 12 yards and undoing all his good work through the night by letting it bobble past him into the net .			0

@entity4 beat @entity9 2 - 1 to win @entity7 final in @entity11
@entity3 @entity2 scores the winning goal early in the first period of extra time
the win means @entity4 become first @entity5 side to claim @entity37 trophy
