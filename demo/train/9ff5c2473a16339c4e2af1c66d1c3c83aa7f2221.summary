@entity2 was initially not named in the @entity8 rugby league @entity19 squad , having told selectors he was unavailable , but @entity13 told @entity1 that the lure of lifting a @entity19 in another sport had prompted a change of heart			1
" he 's in a position where he could win two @entity10 in two different sports , " said @entity13			0

@entity13 would only say to expect to see him at the rugby league @entity19 -- where he is expected to be one of the tournament 's main drawcards -- and that another professional boxing bout was planned for the off - season			2
