" as the news broke , inevitably , the discussion turned to the @entity5			1
but as i watched the killer 's video , questions about the @entity7 began to rise			1
what are @entity13 's post-mortem first amendment rights ? does his screed belong in the marketplace of ideas ? what about those who capitalized on it ? where does the @entity7 leave off and ethics begin ? the video was initially on @entity23 , which immediately -- and presumably automatically -- used it as an opportunity to sell adwords			1
that struck some people as distasteful			2
after all , @entity29 -- which owns @entity23 -- has the unofficial credo " do n't be evil			1
" profiting from the hateful ravings of a mass murderer might easily be described as evil			2
let 's cut the internet giant some slack -- it places such ads automatically on all videos			1
but one would hope that @entity29 , realizing it was profiting from the words of a mass murderer , might decide the ad sales were n't worth it			2
on the other hand , @entity29 is n't a public service , it is a business , and if we want that video to be on the @entity50 , someone has to pay for the bandwidth			1
that raises the question whether the video should be on the internet at all			1
some credible scholars say that making mass murderers famous motivates other mass murderers			2
( one might even argue that this article is part of the problem )			2
@entity13 sent his lengthy diatribe to the media before he went on his killing spree -- correctly predicting that his actions would propel his ideas ( such as they were ) into the marketplace of ideas on a digital billboard larger than he could ever have enjoyed had he not amplified them with his psychotic rampage			2
accordingly , should we not silence him ? wipe his words from the internet forever ? let him be forgotten ? there is a counter-argument -- let 's let everyone see him for what he was -- a pathetic figure , worthy of no respect or pity			1
let him stand as a negative example			2
we allow " @entity84 " to be published and even study it			2
but what of those who believe @entity13 is a positive example ? sickeningly enough , some expressed admiration for what he did , as there will always be people who glorify the worst among us			0
while the overwhelming view is one of horror and disgust , some people put up a @entity99 page praising him			1
as much as i disagree with that view , my beliefs are strong enough that i can tolerate theirs			0
some might say that such a perspective must be purged			0
the @entity7 would find such a purge to be intolerable -- if enforced by the government or force of law			0
the @entity7 is there to protect unpopular beliefs , and the marketplace of ideas should be open to this -- and i would hope that none would visit the stall in the marketplace to buy them			0
that , however , ignores the issue of ethics			0
if someone wanted to glorify @entity13 on my blog , i would say " my blog , my rules , " and i would not tolerate it			0
that would not be a @entity7 violation			0
in fact , the right not to speak is as precious as the right to speak			0
let 's say that @entity13 's supporters went from website to website and were met with rejection at every corner			1
their ideas would , theoretically , die out -- but they would die a natural death , condemned by a lack of nourishment in the marketplace of ideas			0
@entity99 initially was confronted with this dilemma ; when people began to protest about the @entity146 page , the company allegedly took the all - too - common position we hear from arrogant tech companies : they did n't have to take it down , so they would n't			1
@entity99 was completely within its legal rights to take that position -- but what an ethically bankrupt decision ! only when pressure became too great did @entity99 seem to cave in to public opinion			1
the apparently belated reversal of position was hypocritical at best			1
if @entity99 wants to be an anything - goes - and - we - do n't - care company , then it should have let the page be			1
otherwise , the company could have taken the position that it would not allow such filth on its digital real estate			0
either position would have been completely within its rights			0
but braying " free speech " only until it could n't stand the heat from that decision ? shame on @entity99			1
what this story shows us is not so much that our notions of free speech should be strong , but there is room for free speech and ethics			0
the @entity7 allows us to publish @entity13 's rant and his video			1
the @entity7 protects our right to criticize him , to pity him , to hate him , or even to declare him a hero			0
but , just as with any rights , what we can do and what we should do may not be the same thing			0
i would hope that we will not forget that , and that the online giants might begin to learn it .			0

@entity194 : *shooter* 's video rant is legal to post , but is it ethical ?
@entity194 : was @entity23 right to show video when it would make money from it ?
he asks : does the video motivate others to murder ? or does it show how *repulsive* he is
@entity194 : @entity99 took down page praising him after initial *refusal* : a hypocritical decision
