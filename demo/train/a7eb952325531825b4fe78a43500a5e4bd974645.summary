-- @entity2 gov. @entity1 has appointed capt. @entity3 of the @entity4 , a black man , to take over the security on the ground in @entity8			1
the president has issued a call for calm in the wake of a weekend police shooting that left teenager @entity14 dead			1
hopefully we will not see a repeat of the chaos of wednesday night , when protesters clashed with police			0
at this point , we ought to be thinking about what the best outcome for the citizens of @entity8 and the family of @entity14 will be			1
monday night i was at a reception for civil rights icon rep. @entity27 where he spoke eloquently about the importance of voting			0
anyone in the black community who says voting is a waste of time because " they do n't care about us " should take a good , hard look at @entity8 , @entity2			1
almost 68 % of its citizens are black and just under 30 % are white			2
five of six city council members are white , the mayor is white , the chief of police is white , and its police force has 50 whites and three blacks			2
( by the way , has anyone seen any black police officers in @entity8 ? ) to me the miracle of @entity8 is that the citizens have had the courage to stand up to a power structure that generally does not include them			1
they are finding the resilience to fight against their oppression , as they appear to have been living in a police state for a very long time			0
a @entity2 attorney general report on racial profiling last year showed that there were 611 searches in @entity8 : 562 of blacks ; 47 of whites ; one of a @entity72 ; and one of a @entity74			1
although whites represent almost 30 % of the population , they represent less than 10 % of those stopped , according to the report			0
many people may think those statistics do n't look unusual because they genuinely believe blacks are more likely to commit crimes and should be stopped and searched more frequently			0
but consider that in instances where contraband was found , a higher percentage of whites ( 34 % ) who were stopped had contraband when compared with blacks ( 22 % )			0
against this backdrop , the citizen protest wednesday night over @entity14 's death , in the face of a militarized response , was courageous			2
why ? because the police in @entity8 are clearly out of control			1
they have tear - gassed and reportedly shot rubber bullets at demonstrators			0
they have arrested two reporters -- one of whom works for the @entity102 and was wearing his press credentials around his neck at the time , the other from the @entity106			0
they have pointed high - powered rifles at unarmed citizens in front of cameras ; they have refused to identify themselves when making arrests ; and they have refused to identify or arrest the police officer who killed @entity14			1
the chief of police says he wo n't release the name because of fears for that officer 's safety			0
now that he is in charge , perhaps @entity3 will have confidence in his ability to not only guarantee the safety of the police officer , but also the safety of all the citizens of @entity8			2
witnesses say @entity14 had his hands in the air when he was shot repeatedly by the police officer			2
the medical examiner 's report will put any speculation to rest ; @entity14 's body will speak from the grave			0
but what will his legacy be for @entity8 , @entity2 , and the nation ? elected officials do n't have to care about black citizens as long as they do n't fear them at the ballot box			1
every member of the city council who has sat by silently while citizens were treated like second - class citizens should be voted out of office ; @entity14 's death must result in one of the largest voter registration drives in the history of the state of @entity2			1
that would be a lasting legacy for such a senseless and untimely death .			0

@entity157 : @entity2 gov. @entity1 appointed highway patrol chief to take over in @entity8
she says lesson of @entity14 case : *underrepresented* black citizens must vote
most @entity8 citizens are black , but power structure *dominated* by whites , she says
@entity14 : police out of control ; young man is dead . citizens should respond at ballot box
