-- consider who comes to mind when we think of entrepreneurs			0
does a day go by without mention of @entity6 , @entity7 or @entity8 in the media ? while admirable , these men are not accessible , especially to women			1
women are as likely as men to think entrepreneurship is a good career choice , that entrepreneurs have high status , and are represented positively in the media			2
so why do they admire this endeavor from afar , but think they are less equipped to do this ? a study of women entrepreneurs released last december by the @entity24 ( @entity24 ) found an estimated 187 million women starting and running businesses in 59 economies			1
that 's a lot of women entrepreneurs -- about equal to the population of @entity31			1
yet this pales in comparison to the number of men running businesses			1
in only one of the 59 economies ( @entity38 ) were there more women than men entrepreneurs			2
of the other 58 , a handful had equal participation among the sexes , but the majority showed fewer women entrepreneurs than men -- with a ratio as low as 1:5 in @entity49 , meaning there were five male entrepreneurs for every female entrepreneur			1
the biggest concern right now for policymakers centers on job creation			0
when people have jobs , society thrives , both economically and socially			0
entrepreneurship plays a major role in job creation -- it is high - growth entrepreneurs who provide the majority of net new jobs in a society each year			2
we should be concerned when any group in society is excluded , even in part , from this activity , and when those participating tend to shy away from higher potential ventures			0
films take on media portrayal of beauty why are n't there more women entrepreneurs ? one explanation , revealed in the @entity24 study , centers on attitudes			2
fewer women than men believe there are lots of opportunities for entrepreneurship and that they have the capabilities for this endeavor			1
women are also more likely than men to be dissuaded by fear of failure			1
in wealthier countries , where entrepreneurs face more competition and markets are more sophisticated , the gap widens			0
it may stem from less awareness , training , or experience with entrepreneurship , but a seeming lack of confidence in one 's capabilities and an aversion to failure is disconcerting			1
in addition , women are less likely to know an entrepreneur personally			2
their inner circle of advisors is smaller , less diverse , and more often made up of family , spouses , in particular			0
what all this suggests is that women need more entrepreneurial role models , for one			1
this is happening in @entity31 , @entity122 and even @entity123 , where women entrepreneurs , even those in traditionally male - dominated fields are celebrated in the media and given recognition for their accomplishments			1
dr. @entity130 is the owner and founder of @entity132 , which offers customized market research for an extensive list of public agencies and private companies			0
she is a role model in her home country of @entity138			0
yet her story , and those of other successful women entrepreneurs , are scarcely in the public eye			0
top female chef 's recipe for success other elements include training and guidance , as well as connecting women with other like - minded entrepreneurs to share experiences and provide support and advice			0
programs like the @entity157 10,000 women project are providing women with training , networks , and the confidence to grow their businesses			1
in @entity163 , the @entity165 initiative holds roundtable discussions for women entrepreneurs , led by female mentors who have successfully grown their businesses			1
what remains a challenge , however , is infusing these positive attitudes across societies			0
women entrepreneurs need people willing to invest in their businesses			2
they need families that support their ambitions , customers willing to buy from them , suppliers willing to work with them , and employees willing to work for them			0
when stakeholders such as these , and their societies as a whole , embrace their efforts , their economies can benefit from the ideas , the creativity , and the energy of half their population .			0

the number of women running businesses in the world is about equal to the population of @entity31
women are more likely than men to be dissuaded by fear of failure and to doubt their capabilities
mentors and role models would help grow confidence , says expert @entity207
