@entity0 , @entity1 -- shares in @entity4 rose monday after the company announced that it had made progress in understanding the cause of a @entity9 mid-air engine blow - out			1
the shares rose by 2.62 percent -- they had been 14 percent down from thursday after the @entity12 carrier revealed early monday that oil leaks had been discovered in the engines on three of its planes after being examined by @entity4 engineers			1
this follows last week 's aborted flight by an @entity20 , which was forced to make an emergency landing in @entity22 shortly after take off when one of its engines failed			2
@entity4 on monday issued a statement saying the @entity9 problem was caused by an " incident specific to the @entity30 engine			1
" " as a result , a series of checks and inspections has been agreed with @entity36 , with operators of the @entity30 powered @entity20 and with the airworthiness authorities , " the @entity4 statement continued			1
@entity9 ceo @entity39 told reporters the leaks were " beyond normal tolerances " and that the planes will not return to service until the airline is " 100 percent sure " about their safety , " it is disturbing that @entity9 found three more engines that needed to be looked at			1
that 's a total of four , " aviation consultant @entity49 told @entity2			2
" this is a relatively ... young aircraft			0
these engines have probably less than 200,000 total hours , so it is an issue that we need to be concerned about			0
" new safety fears ground @entity57 @entity22 airlines and @entity59 also operate the @entity20 equipped with @entity61 900 engines , but they reported no problems after carrying out their own extensive checks			1
their fleets are now flying again			0
@entity66 - based @entity65 also operate the double - decked @entity20 but with @entity68 engines , designed as part of a joint venture between @entity73 manufacturers @entity71 and @entity74			0
these engines have not been part of the current safety scare			0
before the share price recovery , more than $ 1.6 billion had been wiped off the value of @entity80 - based @entity4 , its share value dropping by 14 percent since thursday			1
shares in @entity83 , which owns @entity36 , were down by half a percent for the same period			1
" we 're looking at a period of time when investors will be pretty jittery , " said @entity85 of @entity86			0
" but they 've got to grapple with this problem in a way that maintains confidence among their prospective customers as well as existing customers			0
" if it is some kind of underlying design flaw , though this would seem unlikely given the enormous expertise and modern computer simulation technology available to @entity4 , then there could be a problem given the level of investment involved			2
" in august , another @entity4 engine -- this time a @entity106 -- suffered an uncontained failure during testing in @entity1			2
this particular model is designed to power @entity112 's latest commercial aircraft , the @entity113			0
@entity4 said on tuesday that the @entity106 issue was not connected to the @entity9 @entity30 incident			1
@entity4 said in the statement : " this incident happened during a development program with an engine operating outside normal parameters			1
we understand the cause and a solution has been implemented			0
" with at least half of the 850 787s on order destined to be powered by @entity127 , @entity85 told @entity2 that this will be another profitable source of income for a very long time			0
" many airlines have placed orders for aircraft years down the line and have not yet selected their preferred engine , " he said			0
" but no - one has a better reputation than @entity4			2
many airlines will order @entity4 engines as a matter of course because they 've had first rate service from them for years			2
" not every airline see it this way , but many -- particularly small and medium - sized airlines -- feel some comfort in having a single supplier of engines for all the aircraft they fly because it provides some commonality with maintenance , spares and training for mechanics			0
" as if to reinforce this point , @entity4 on monday announced a new $ 350 million engine servicing contract with @entity157 , who operate a fleet of @entity160 fitted with @entity162 engines .			1
