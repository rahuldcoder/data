@entity0 , @entity1 -- a court handed down a 20 - year sentence thursday for an @entity1 man convicted of helping assemble the bombs that killed more than 200 people in @entity8 in 2002			1
the @entity0 court found @entity10 , 45 , guilty of taking part in premeditated murder and conspiracy to smuggle explosives and firearms for use in terror attacks			1
@entity10 had faced a maximum penalty of death , and the courtroom was packed for the verdict delivered by a panel of five judges			1
he stared at the floor and showed no emotion as the verdict was read			1
he shook the judges ' hands and hugged his lawyer before he was escorted to a car waiting in the basement of the courthouse for transportation to a jail on the outskirts of the city			2
@entity10 , who has expressed remorse for his actions , will consider appealing to a higher court , said his lawyer @entity39			1
@entity39 said he was " very disappointed " by the verdict			2
" @entity10 did what he was accused for because he was under pressure from his seniors , and he failed to convince them to prevent the attacks , although he already tried hard to do so , " @entity39 said			1
@entity10 was one of @entity1 's most wanted terrorists , with a $ 1 million bounty on his head from the @entity51 government 's @entity49			1
three of the masterminds of the @entity8 bombings -- @entity54 , @entity55 and @entity56 -- were executed in 2008			2
@entity10 was the last of the accused to stand trial in @entity1			1
the october 12 , 2002 , blasts tore apart two nightclubs in @entity61 , a town popular with tourists on the @entity1 island of @entity8			2
at the time , the country 's police chief called the attack " the worst act of terrorism in the country 's history			2
" among the dead were 88 @entity72 and seven @entity51			0
@entity10 eluded investigators looking into the 2002 attacks for many years until his capture in january 2011 in @entity76 , @entity77 , the same village where @entity78 shot and killed @entity80 leader @entity79 several months later			1
@entity10 was extradited to @entity1 in august			1
he faced six charges , including premeditated murder , for his part in the @entity8 bombings , as well as helping build bombs used in a series of attacks on christmas eve in 2000			1
he also was accused of smuggling firearms from the @entity89 to @entity1 and planning a militant camp in @entity91 in 2010			2
@entity10 denied all the charges but admitted helping mix a relatively small amount of the total quantity of explosives used in the @entity8 attack			1
the first bomb detonated in the busy @entity99 on @entity100 just after 11 p.m. , according to a report from the @entity102			0
seconds later , as survivors fled the first blast , a second larger bomb hidden in a van exploded outside the crowded @entity108			0
a third bomb went off later near the @entity51 @entity111 in @entity112 , a suburb of @entity113 , the @entity72 police said			0
hundreds were reported missing in the confusion that followed the blasts			0
many of those killed were foreign vacationers , although some residents were also caught in the attack			0
according to testimony given may 31 during his trial , @entity10 said that when he arrived in @entity8 , 950 kilograms of explosives had been combined , and he reluctantly agreed to mix the remainder			1
" when i saw @entity128 , aka @entity129 , looking exhausted and nervous , finally i agreed to helped him and both of us mixed the explosive ingredients that were less then 50 kg. i did it lazily because it did n't come from my soul and it was contrary to my conscience , " he said , according to an @entity126 translation of his testimony			0
@entity129 was sentenced to life in prison in 2004 for his role in the attacks			0
during his trial , @entity10 asked for forgiveness for the bombings , which he said he " even suggested canceling			1
" after the attacks , he said , he felt " remorse and regret			0
" " i said that it was my last involvement on that kind of action in @entity1			2
please know that whether i came to @entity8 or not , the @entity8 bomb would still have happen ( ed ) , " he said			0
@entity10 's lawyer argued that his client was not directly involved in the planning of the bombings			1
he does n't deny helping assemble the bombs but was unaware how they would ultimately be used , his lawyer , @entity39 , said during @entity10 's trial , which started in february			1
@entity39 slammed the prosecution 's case as " vague and far from the truth " and argued that an anti-terrorism law introduced in @entity1 in 2003 could not be used retroactively for the 2002 attacks			0
prosecutors have used several articles under the penal code , the emergency rule law and the 2003 anti-terrorism law to charge @entity10			1
@entity10 is one of the last figures associated with a splinter group of @entity172 , an @entity80 - linked terror group behind the @entity8 bombings and other attacks in @entity1			1
many in that group , like @entity10 , trained and fought in @entity77 and @entity176 in the early 1990s and were deeply influenced by @entity79 's teachings			1
@entity10 fled to @entity178 in the southern @entity89 with several other @entity1 militants			1
one of them was @entity181 , another former @entity172 member , who returned to @entity1 and helped set up a military - style training camp in province of @entity91			0
he was killed in a police raid just outside @entity0 in october 2010			0
@entity10 returned to @entity1 from the @entity89 in 2009			2
prosecutors allege that he was involved in preparing firearms for the @entity91 training camp , a charge the defense disputes			0
" @entity10 was only in transit in @entity1 and was not involved in training of firearms , " @entity39 said			2
" he was there to attend a wedding and he did n't even see the firearms			0
" @entity1 authorities have tried and convicted hundreds of terrorists since the 2002 @entity8 bombings			0
the arrests of senior militants with combat experience have weakened the terror network and its ability to launch major attacks			0
radical @entity1 cleric sentenced to 15 years in prison according to recent reports by the @entity210 , the terror threat in the country remains but has shifted to attacks on @entity1 authorities , with smaller groups or radicalized individuals targeting the police			2
