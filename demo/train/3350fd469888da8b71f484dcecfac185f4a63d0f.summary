-- for months , @entity1 derisively doubted if @entity3 president @entity2 was a true friend of @entity4 and prime minister @entity5 , questioning if @entity3 should re-elect someone who might not be on the same page with the long - time @entity3 ally			1
now , it 's @entity5 facing political heat in his own country -- for his relationship with @entity2			2
despite sometimes blistering attacks over where his administration stands on @entity4 and against @entity16 's nuclear program , @entity2 this week emerged victorious in the @entity3 presidential election			1
but @entity5 has months to go in his own campaign , including time to answer questions about his relationship with the @entity3 leader			0
leading the charge against the prime minister is the @entity24 , which holds more seats at 28 than any other in @entity4 's @entity27 and which quit @entity5 's coalition government in july			1
the centrist party is among those aiming to gain more power and unseat @entity5 when @entity4 go to the polls on january 22 , 2013			1
@entity24 wasted little time after @entity2 's election win in going after @entity5			1
in a post wednesday on its @entity37 page , the party claimed the prime minister had sided with @entity3 @entity1 presidential nominee @entity39 and could not be trusted -- by @entity2 and , moreover , by @entity4 -- to be a robust , effective partner with @entity41			1
in that post and in an open letter on its website , @entity24 highlighted the importance of @entity3 - @entity4 relations			1
@entity47 media is abuzz , too , about a wednesday speech by former prime minister @entity49 in which he claimed that @entity5 had interjected himself into the @entity3 election by trying to undermine the incumbent president			2
multiple @entity47 media outlets reported @entity49 said @entity5 got involved in part to satisfy @entity54 , who donated close to $ 100 million this year toward defeating @entity2 and electing republicans to @entity56 , according to insiders involved in the process			1
the @entity59 reported @entity49 said that " @entity5 's behavior in recent months brings up the question if @entity5 has a friend in the @entity63 , and i 'm not sure			0
" " this represents a significant breach of the basic rules governing ties between nations , made worse by the fact that these are allies like @entity4 and the @entity3 , " @entity49 said in the same speech to @entity47 leaders in @entity66 , according to another leading @entity47 newspaper , @entity67			2
@entity5 and officials in his government have beaten down such accusations of meddling , while playing up what they describe as strong ties between @entity4 and the @entity3			2
in a statement congratulating @entity2 , @entity5 said , " the security relationship between the @entity3 and @entity4 is rock solid , and i look forward to working with president @entity2 to further strengthen this relationship			1
" in an interview thursday with @entity0 's @entity88 , deputy foreign minister @entity86 acknowledged that @entity39 and @entity5 have a special connection from having once worked together at the same @entity3 - based consulting firm , but " to say there was a preference , it 's a little bit of a stretch			1
" " we have no better friend than president @entity2 , " @entity86 said , repeating an assertion he 'd made previously			0
the deputy foreign minister credited @entity2 with spearheading international sanctions and other punitive measures that he said has made @entity16 " very vulnerable ... socially , politically , economically			0
" whatever past differences there might have been about timelines and goals , @entity86 said @entity4 will follow the @entity3 president 's cue when it comes to @entity16			2
" i think today we can safely say that we are very much of the same page , and we 'll continue to follow the lead of the @entity3 , " he said			0
such a line of questioning , and political attacks , about @entity3 - @entity4 relations is nothing new -- as evidenced in the recent @entity3 election			1
for months , @entity1 hammered @entity2 , claiming he had n't been a loyal enough friend to @entity5 or tough enough on @entity16			0
one public dust - up came earlier this fall , when @entity4 sources told @entity0 the @entity63 had turned down a request for a meeting between @entity5 and @entity2 while both were in @entity66 for a @entity123 meeting , prompting @entity39 to say he " ca n't imagine ever saying no " to a meeting request from @entity5			1
the @entity63 later said no request had been made , and within hours of the story breaking , @entity2 called the prime minister and said the two countries maintain " close cooperation on @entity16 and other security issues			0
" the @entity2 administration has stressed repeatedly that it is committed to maintaining a strong relationship with @entity4			0
in may 2011 , the president said , " the bonds between the @entity3 and @entity4 are unbreakable , and the commitment of the @entity3 to the security of @entity4 is ironclad			0
" now , the same issue -- how well can @entity5 and @entity2 work with and trust each other -- is being debated nearly 6,000 miles from @entity41 in another heated election			0
this is a testament to the unique , historically tight relations between these two nations , as well as the vibrant brand of democracy that define their political systems			0
despite obvious differences , @entity5 and @entity24 leader @entity148 did unite this week on one matter -- lauding the @entity3 political system and expressing their desire for @entity4 to follow its lead			2
@entity148 described " @entity3 democracy ( as ) a beacon for @entity4 and her people			0
" @entity5 , meanwhile , characterized the @entity3 as " the greatest democracy on @entity160			0

republicans had *criticized* @entity2 over whether he was close enough to @entity4
now @entity4 *opposition* leaders are saying @entity5 ca n't be trusted by @entity2
@entity3 - @entity4 relations may be a factor in @entity4 's election , set for january 2013
