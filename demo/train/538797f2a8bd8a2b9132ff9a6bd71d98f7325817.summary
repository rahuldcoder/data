ten years after the @entity2 started a program to spot terrorists by observing passenger behavior , the agency has spent more than $ 900 million on the program but has yet to prove its effectiveness , congressional overseers say			1
and @entity9 risks wasting more money if it continues funding the program without scientific proof that it works , the @entity8 said in a report			2
the report is the most critical yet pitting the @entity8 critics against the @entity2 , which has long believed that trained observers can pick out people who pose a threat to aviation by looking for signs of stress , fear or deception			1
the agency has deployed an ever - increasing number of so - called behavior detection officers , calling them a " vital component " of its security program			1
read the report in fiscal 2011 and 2012 , about 3,000 such officers were deployed to 176 major airports nationwide , where they observed about 1.3 billion people , the report says			0
the @entity8 said @entity2 tests of the program were flawed , and decades of published research on behavior detection " also draw into question the scientific underpinnings " of the program			1
those studies show that the ability of trained observers to detect deceptive behavior is " the same as or slightly better than chance			1
" but the @entity2 defends the program , saying security would be damaged if money is cut			0
" behavior detection techniques have been an accepted practice for many years within the law enforcement , customs and border enforcement , defense , and security communities both in the @entity56 and internationally , " the @entity2 wrote in a response to the @entity8			1
under the program , uniformed behavior detection officers scan passengers in line and engage them in brief verbal exchanges , identifying passengers who exhibit certain behaviors			2
different behaviors are assigned point values , and if a passenger exceeds a point " threshold , " they are referred to secondary screening , where they undergo a pat - down and search of their personal property , while officers continue to look for behavioral clues			0
if another threshold is passed , or if fraudulent documents are discovered , the behavior detection officer refers the passenger to a law enforcement officer for further investigation			2
the law enforcement officer may choose to allow the passenger to proceed or could question the passenger further			0
the initial observation takes less than 30 seconds , but the lengthier screening takes an average 13 minutes , and referrals to police can take longer , according to an outline of the process in the @entity8 report			0
" the report released today by @entity8 displays what i have been saying for years -- that @entity2 's ( detection ) program is fundamentally flawed , can not be proven effective , and should no longer be funded with taxpayers dollars , " rep. @entity91 , @entity92 , said in a written statement			2
@entity91 , the ranking @entity98 on the @entity99 , said he will question @entity2 administrator @entity100 about the report at a hearing thursday			0
@entity104 shooting reignites debate over @entity2 worker 's role in security			0

@entity8 says @entity2 has spent $ 900 million on *unproven* terrorist - spotting program
the program has trained observers looking for signs of stress , fear or deception
the @entity8 says the results of the program are " the same as or slightly better than chance "
@entity2 : behavior detection techniques are a long - accepted practice
