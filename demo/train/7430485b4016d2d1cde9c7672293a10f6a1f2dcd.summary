-- my dad was an avid sports fan and a great athlete in his day			1
we used to watch basketball and football games together , and i know some of his proudest moments as a father were when i wore my sports uniforms in high school and college			1
he was a man 's man — a hard drinking , foul - mouthed veteran of the @entity15 who came on to every voluptuous nurse who crossed his path			1
he passed away about this time last year			0
i think about him often , and more during @entity19			0
i thought about him yesterday as i read about @entity20 coming out as the first openly gay player in @entity23 history			1
i wondered , " if my dad were reading this , what would he say ? " and , clear as day , i heard his voice			1
" yeah , but can the dude play ? " it made me laugh because is n't it just that simple ? can he play ? can he do his job ? at the same time that @entity20 ' announcement has caused a stir , there also has been noteworthy non-reaction among many			1
" is this really still news ? " we ask			0
it is news because it 's never happened before			0
pro sports , especially the ones where athletes get paid millions upon millions of dollars , are bastion of masculinity			1
manhood , athleticism and heterosexuality are all woven together in our cultural paradigm			0
it 's still news because the stereotype of gay men as being effete , weak , uncoordinated ( except where it comes to @entity57 impersonations ) and otherwise " girly " is still so strong			0
in @entity23 , @entity20 ' defense matters more than sexual orientation it should n't be			1
gay comes in all shapes , sizes , strengths and personalities			0
it should n't be news that — guess what — some gay people do n't fit your stereotype			2
it should n't be news for that reason , but i 'm grateful that it is news for an entirely different reason			2
@entity20 's coming out is a very , very public " it gets better " message to all the @entity82 youth coming up , and out , right now			1
according to the @entity88 , an organization providing crisis intervention and suicide prevention services to @entity82 youth , suicide is the third leading cause of death for 10 - to 24 - year - olds , and its the second leading cause of death on college campuses			2
lesbian , gay and bisexual youth are four times more likely to attempt suicide than their straight peers			0
this is why an openly gay @entity23 player should be news , because it busts stereotypes , normalizes homosexuality and gives kids of all orientations a positive role model of self - love and professional excellence			2
until there are no more hate crimes , no more vicious bullying and ugly slurs , whenever a person comes out — whether that person is a celebrity or a " nobody " — it should be celebrated like the triumph of courage it is			0
that is why it should be news			0
@entity20 is tremendously brave and deserves to be celebrated as such			1
all that said , we aback to the question my dad would have asked			2
" yeah , but can the dude play ? " yes , he can play			1
he 's an aggressive , big man who holds his space on the court			0
at 34 , he 's probably aging out of the sport , but he 's played consistently and well over the years and deserves to be remembered for what he has done on the court , not what he did while off			0
opinion : here 's to @entity20 -- and the @entity23 i applaud his career and his bravery , and i look forward to the day that sexual orientation is a non-issue			1
we are all so much more than our sexuality			2
it is vital to the situations in which it 's important — namely , in looking for a mate — but it has nothing to do with job performance , whether your job is as a secretary or a professional basketball player			2
our sexuality is just one of a thousand pieces of our identity , not the sole determining factor			2
that 's not all he is , and it would be nice if we could keep this one piece of identity in context with the whole			0
finally , it 's nice to see institutionalized homophobia crumbling			1
first it was the military , with the repeal of do n't ask , do n't tell			1
for decades , the argument had been that having openly gay people in the military would impair unit cohesion			0
setting aside all the flawed assumptions that undergird those fears , you know what has happened to unit cohesion since the fall of do n't ask , do n't tell ? it 's stayed the same or gotten slightly better			2
this is probably because it 's easier for people to bond when they 're not forbidden from being themselves			0
first , it was the military , now it 's pro sports being forced to realize that there is no " us " and " them " when it comes to sexuality			1
we are all on the same team			0
i 'll bet that @entity20 will be the first in a string of professional athletes to openly acknowledge their homosexuality			1
you can also think of him as the next in a chain of civil rights pioneers			0
and i 'll bet you 'll start seeing them play a bit better			0
we 're all at our best when we do n't have to hide who we are , when we can bring it all to the court			0
i 'm proud to see @entity20 come out and encouraged to see the overwhelmingly positive reaction he 's received			1
and yet , i ca n't wait for the day we greet it with " so what ? " and a yawn			1
i think my dad would agree			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			1

@entity218 says her sports - fan dad would have been *unconcerned* about sexuality
he *'d* have said , " yeah , but can the dude play ? " *competence* not same as sexuality , she says
she says orientation should be a yawn in a just world , but @entity20 ' coming out hugely important
@entity218 : homophobia crumbling . first with do n't ask , do n't tell repeal , now in sports
