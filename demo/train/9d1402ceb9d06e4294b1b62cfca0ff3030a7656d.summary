-- " people think that education lasts until you graduate from school			0
but i think that people should continue to learn even after graduation			0
" -- yasuaki @entity8 @entity8 believes that education should be lifelong and open to everyone			1
@entity13 's bustling , youthful @entity12 district , the backdrop for much of the indie film " @entity16 , " is a hip , neon - lit hub for @entity20 's cutting - edge set			1
its crammed streets , flashy fashions and hectic pace make it an exhilarating experience that 's often intimidating for the faint hearted			0
but behind this flamboyant exterior , @entity12 is also home to an organization with a deeper passion -- for learning			1
founded in 2006 , @entity32 is a new system of education that 's firmly rooted in its local community			1
there are no entrance examinations ; classes take place in the city 's surroundings ; and teachers come from all walks of life			2
@entity32 is led by @entity8 , a 28 - year - old ex-accountant			1
@entity8 believes passionately that education is for life , that we can all learn from each other and that teaching should n't be confined to the classroom			0
@entity8 was working for trading company @entity51 when he read about @entity54 assembly member @entity53 's idea of a university based within the @entity12 community that focused on lifelong education			1
he was seeking a new mission : one that would bring benefits to his community			0
the two men discussed their visions of a university that was open to all ; then @entity8 quit his job to run the @entity12 project			1

" my idea was to bring together the most interesting elements of education and the attractive parts of @entity12			0
" this free - flowing approach to learning contrasts markedly with the stiff , conformist image of traditional @entity20 education			1
@entity12 acts as a catalyst , breathing knowledge and life through the community			2
its classes , which range from traditional @entity20 culture to environmental issues , are enormously popular , with many oversubscribed			2
its " classrooms " have included shopping complexes , museums and the gardens of @entity98			0
there 's no clear distinction between students and teachers and no graduation from classes			0
teachers have ranged from janitors to best - selling sports writers			0

in the future , @entity8 hopes @entity12 will grow			1
" i want [ it ] to help @entity12 become a better place , " he says			2
the university may act as a model for similar projects : @entity8 's vision of a symbiosis between learning and the community has sparked interest from @entity124 , the @entity125 and @entity126			1
but @entity8 says his own future is to continue on his mission to serve his community			2
" for me personally , my goal has no end , " he told @entity0			0
