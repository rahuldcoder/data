when a building is on fire , every second counts for the first responders rushing to the scene			0
a computer - savvy firefighter in @entity7 is hoping a bit of futuristic wearable technology and clever programming can help save time and lives			1
@entity13 has developed an app for @entity15 , @entity17 's experimental head - mounted computer , which feeds important information directly to the eye - line of firefighters in an emergency			1
" i 'll hear a little notification and can look up into the top corner of my vision and see a map of where it is			0
i see the location of the incident and what type of call it is , " @entity13 said			0
by routing information directly to @entity15 , the app can save firefighters from having to stop what they 're doing in order to reach for a radio , smartphone , tablet or computer			1
@entity13 plans on adding even more useful data in future versions , like information on specific buildings including blueprints , potential building hazards and contact information for owners			0
a firefighter might be able to say an address out loud or simply look at a building with the @entity15 camera to retrieve information			1
@entity15 can also record the first video of a situation when crews arrive			2
that early documentation will be important to fire investigations down the line			0
for now , @entity15 is n't compatible with the oxygen masks firefighters wear on the ground , so the app is more for external personnel			1
@entity13 's @entity15 stays behind in the truck			1
people like @entity13 who are finding genuinely helpful uses for the device might help @entity15 gain more widespread acceptance			2
@entity15 has struggled with its public image since @entity17 first made it available to a limited group of developers in april			2
the device 's ability to snap photos and record video and audio has raised privacy concerns from regular people and even members of @entity83			0
its use in social situations and public venues has led to etiquette questions			0
the device hit a legal speed bump when a woman in @entity92 was cited for wearing @entity15 while driving			2
her case was later dismissed when the court did n't find enough evidence that the device was turned on			0
there 's even an unfortunate epithet just for the people who wear @entity15 regularly : glassholes			1
that 's not what @entity13 saw when a group of skydivers demonstrated @entity15 at the annual @entity17 developers conference in 2012			1
" they had a video of some guy diving out of a blimp wearing @entity15 and riding a bike into the conference , " @entity13 said			2
" right then i started thinking about uses for the firefighter			0
" a self - taught programmer , @entity13 first started tinkering with computers when he was 7 and later spent a year studying computer science in college before transferring to the @entity118 , @entity119 , for an environmental management and policy program			0
he became a firefighter and did n't do much with computers for another decade			0
then , about four years ago , he purchased a smartphone and was inspired to start programming again			0
" since then i 've taught myself way more than i ever knew about programming			0
i 've developed an @entity128 app , an @entity130 app and a @entity15 app , " @entity13 said			1
his first project was the @entity128 app firefighter log , which similarly routed key information directly to the smartphone , including text messages from fire and @entity140 dispatchers , streams of emergency radio feeds , and location information for fires and nearby hydrants			1
@entity13 says more than 20,000 people have downloaded the apps			0
to get his hands on @entity15 , @entity13 submitted his idea to @entity17 's @entity151 competition			1
he raised money to cover the cost of the hardware through an @entity156 campaign and received the device in september			0
fire departments do n't all have the funding necessary to upgrade to the latest technology , but many are seeing the potential to save money and become more efficient at the same time			1
@entity13 's own @entity164 recently installed @entity165 in its vehicles			0
the tablets cost significantly less than the laptops they 're replacing and can show the same information , such as call notes , fire hydrant locations , maps and dispatch information			2
" you do n't need a big laptop with a hard drive and all this on it , " @entity13 said			0
other fire departments across the @entity181 have expressed interest in @entity13 's @entity15 setup			1
one wants to take it to the next level and link a thermal imaging camera to @entity15 customized to work with oxygen masks			2
then firefighters could have partial vision through smoke and darkness			0
other fire departments and researchers also are experimenting with wearable technology , thanks to a recent availability of affordable wearable sensors that can track vitals and environmental factors like air quality and temperature			1
the @entity203 , or @entity204 , can track a firefighter 's location as well as physical data such as heart rate , breathing and activity levels in real time			1
a @entity213 finalist for @entity214 created a system that combines location sensors and augmented reality glasses to help firefighters move around buildings when there is minimal visibility			2
when he 's not fighting fires or perfecting his app , @entity13 is working on another possibly life - saving use for @entity15 : an app to help administer cpr			1
using the built - in accelerometer in @entity15 , the app can measure how fast someone 's chest compressions are and instruct the person to go faster or slower .			1

a firefighter has developed a @entity15 app to help first responders save time
the app displays dispatch and location information on its head - mounted screen
wearable technology could soon help firefighters *navigate* when there 's low visibility
