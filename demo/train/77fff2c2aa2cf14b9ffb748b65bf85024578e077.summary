-- massive global greenhouse gas pollution is changing the chemistry of the world 's oceans so much that scientists now predict it could severely damage shellfish populations and the nations that depend on the harvests if significant action is n't taken			1
a new study from the @entity12 in @entity13 shows that ocean acidification is becoming a very serious problem			1
the study was published in july online in the journal @entity19			2
" what the study found was that in the next 10 to 50 years many countries are going to see impacts , particularly countries that are heavily reliant on clams and oysters and mussels , and will not be able to adapt by shifting to other foods or aquaculture methods , " said @entity20 , senior scientist and chief strategist for the international ocean conservation and advocacy organization @entity24			1
ocean acidification , or the changing chemical make - up of seawater , has occurred since the industrial revolution as ocean waters absorbed too much carbon dioxide			1
carbon dioxide is a by - product of human industrial activities , mainly the burning of fossil fuels			1
the @entity47 study found that many marine animals like mollusks and corals that build hard shells and skeletons are most at risk from this			1
those countries directly impacted are mostly poor and developing nations that are heavily dependent on shellfish as main sources for protein , like @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity63			2
but the research also suggests damage caused by ocean acidification could ripple across economies around the world			1
it 's already blamed for economic losses at oyster farms in the @entity72 and the slowing of coral growth in @entity76 's @entity75 , according to @entity24			2
" the truth is , if you look at all the effects of ocean acidification , nobody really gets off the hook , " @entity20 told @entity0			2
" impacts on coral reefs , for example , that can affect tourism , that can affect fisheries because fish depend on coral reefs			0
and when you look at those impacts , what you find is , in many cases , it 's the developed countries , like the @entity96 , the @entity97 and other @entity99 countries that will be impacted			0
" even though this current study by @entity47 found that ocean acidification is likely to have the worst impact on poor and developing nations first , it 's a problem with widespread impact			1
" if you look at @entity109 , where industrial fishing has fished out @entity109 waters and the local fishermen ca n't get food anymore , what do they do ? " @entity20 said			0
" they turn to piracy			0
who does that affect ? that affects anybody with a ship that 's going through those waters			0
they 've taken a lot of different ships hostage			0
so , ultimately , food insecurity can become a national security issue			0
" @entity20 also said , " if all these countries are going to have food insecurities because their clams or oysters are no longer available or because their fisheries are no longer available as a result of climate change , that could put pressure on other countries and it can affect all of us			0
" @entity20 and her organization @entity24 are urging more support for a clean energy sector , something the @entity142 administration has been pushing and trying to develop for several years , and an end to taxpayer subsidies for fossil fuel industries			2
@entity0 's @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report .			0

@entity47 research says poor nations would suffer first
but damage would ripple worldwide , study says
first effects could be seen in 10 to 50 years , scientist says
acidification comes from carbon dioxide
