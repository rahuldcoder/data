@entity4 sent fighter jets into its newly claimed -- and hotly disputed -- air defense zone above the @entity7 on thursday , the same day that @entity1 's military firmly insisted its own patrols over the area would n't stop because of @entity9 's declaration			1
the @entity11 flew warplanes , including @entity13 and j - 11 aircraft , into the " air defense identification zone " that @entity9 announced last week , air force spokesman col. @entity10 said			1
a @entity17 -- an airborne radar early warning system -- also took flight			1
the @entity20 - developed @entity13 is a two - seat aircraft described by its manufacturer as " a highly maneuverable fighter " capable of hitting ground and sea - surface targets			2
the @entity4 - made @entity26 is a single - seat fighter also capable of ground attacks			1
the fighter jets conducted " routine air patrols ... aiming to strengthen monitoring on air targets in the zone and fulfill the air force 's historic mission , " @entity10 said in a statement posted on the @entity4 defense ministry 's website			1
@entity10 portrayed the mission as a " defensive measure ... in line with international practices			2
" @entity4 's military has been on " high alert , " he added , and is prepared to act " based on different air threats to firmly ensure air - defense safety			1
" what comes of @entity9 's latest foray over its controversial newly created zone remained to be determined early friday			2
still , some of its previous actions -- including the declaration itself -- have been met with staunch resistance by @entity1 and its longtime ally , the @entity57			0
on thursday , @entity1 chief cabinet secretary @entity58 said his nation 's @entity59 has used ships and planes to patrol and conduct surveillance in the @entity7 since before @entity4 claimed the air defense zone that covers much of the sea			1
and they would n't stop , he insisted			0
" we have no intention to change this operation in consideration for @entity4 , " @entity58 told reporters			0
" ... we will continue the surveillance / patrol operation with strong determination to protect our territory against @entity4 's one - sided attempt to change the status quo by force			1
" @entity1 is n't alone in disobeying @entity4 , which has warned military measures could be taken if planes entering the zone fail to identify themselves and submit flight planes to @entity4 authorities			1
two unarmed @entity57 b - 52 bombers recently flew through the area in what the @entity86 characterized as a planned military exercise			0
war of words @entity4 has grown more assertive beyond its recognized borders since @entity4 president @entity92 took office about a year ago -- creating a delicate situation for @entity95 , which has promised to focus more on @entity96 and uphold commitments to its allies in the region			0
" unlike his predecessors , @entity92 is making foreign policy with the mindset of a great power , increasingly probing @entity57 commitments to its allies in the region and exploiting opportunities to change the status quo , " @entity101 , director of @entity103 programs at the @entity104 , wrote in a commentary for @entity106 this week the @entity57 and @entity1 have criticized @entity9 's air defense announcement , saying it escalates tensions in the region and raises the risk of an incident			2
they say they wo n't recognize the new zone			0
@entity4 hit back at those comments with strong words of its own , describing the @entity57 and @entity1 statements as unreasonable and unacceptable			2
after news of the @entity57 flights emerged , the @entity127 responded cautiously wednesday , saying it had monitored the planes ' activity on the edge of the air defense zone			0
the statement held back from criticizing the @entity57 action			0
at a regular briefing later wednesday , a journalist asked a @entity139 spokesman if @entity9 is concerned it will now be seen as a " paper tiger			0
" " i want to emphasize that the @entity4 government has enough resolution and capability to safeguard the country 's sovereignty and security , " replied the spokesman , @entity141			0
simmering dispute the bomber flights are the strongest @entity57 involvement yet in a festering territorial dispute in the region between @entity4 and @entity1 over a set of small , uninhabited islands in the @entity7			2
after @entity4 's air defense declaration saturday , @entity57 defense secretary @entity155 reiterated @entity57 support for @entity1 , where thousands of @entity57 troops are stationed as part of a security agreement			1
he said the @entity57 @entity1 @entity161 applies to the disputed islands , known as @entity163 by @entity1 and @entity163 by @entity4			1
uneasy encounters between @entity4 and @entity1 planes and ships have already taken place repeatedly over the past year near the islands , which are believed to have large oil reserves nearby			1
tensions spiked after the @entity1 government purchased some of the islands from a private owner in september 2012 , angering @entity4 authorities , who saw the move as an attempt by @entity1 to tighten control			2
@entity180 warned that @entity4 's " unilateral action " of declaring the air defense zone " increases the risk of misunderstanding and miscalculations			1
" amid the tensions , @entity57 vice president @entity186 will visit the region next week on a previously announced trip , stopping in @entity189 , @entity9 and @entity190 , @entity191			0
why @entity4 's new air zone incensed @entity1 , @entity57 difficult to monitor monday 's @entity57 bomber flights also highlight the challenges that analysts say @entity4 faces in policing its newly claimed air zone			1
in its statement wednesday , the @entity127 said that " @entity4 has the capability to exercise effective control " over the area			0
" @entity9 might have bitten off a bit more than they can chew because actually going out and monitoring these things on an ongoing basis is probably a bit beyond the capabilities of the @entity4 air force right now , " said @entity201 , @entity96 managing editor of @entity202 , an aviation and aerospace industry website			0
" in a sense , it 's more a rhetorical statement , as opposed to a realistic military space , " he said			0
adding to the complications and confusion surrounding the zone , @entity1 's two main commercial airlines said wednesday that following a request from the @entity1 government , they and other members of the @entity220 of @entity1 will not submit flight plans to @entity4 authorities for flights through the zone claimed by @entity9			1
the two carriers , @entity227 and @entity228 , said the association had concluded that there would be " no impact " on the safety of passengers on board flights through the zone without the submission of flight plans to @entity4			0
but @entity238 said he was n't entirely sure about that			0
from a legal point of view , he said , the airlines probably do n't have to report their plans and follow all the rules requested by @entity4			0
" i think from a safety perspective , it 's a good idea for them to do so , " he said			0
" ' the right of every country ' since it declared the new air defense zone over the weekend , @entity4 has been busy making its case for why it feels the move was justified			1
it has pointed out that other countries already operate air defense identification zones in waters around their territory , noting that @entity1 has had a zone in place in the @entity7 since the 1960s			2
" it 's natural , it 's indeed the right of every country to defend its airspace and also to make sure that its territorial integrity , its sovereignty are safeguarded , " @entity4 's @entity263 ambassador @entity262 said tuesday			1
but analysts say that by declaring a zone that now overlaps with that of @entity1 , @entity4 has increased the likelihood of a high - risk incident in the air			1
@entity4 slams ' inappropriate ' @entity57 remarks on territorial dispute with @entity1			2

the planes include @entity13 and @entity26 fighter jets and a @entity17 airborne system
