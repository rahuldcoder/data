-- @entity1 has made huge territorial gains in the border areas between @entity4 and @entity5 during the past month , as well as capturing strategic cities such as @entity7 and @entity8			1
now its leader @entity9 has changed the group 's name from the previous " @entity1 " to " @entity12			1
" he has also appointed himself " caliph " and declared the re-establishment of the caliphate			1
the caliphate is the term used by some @entity18 to mean an @entity12 intended to unify the global @entity20 population ( known as the ummah )			2
it is viewed as the succession to the state founded after the @entity26 's death and , according to @entity27 , is to be governed by one interpretation of @entity29			0
the first four caliphs were considered to be rashidun or " rightly - guided " and especially pious			0
subsequent empires controlled by the @entity32 , the @entity33 and the @entity34 each claimed control of the caliphate but failed to be universally recognized by @entity18			0
when the @entity34 collapsed in 1924 , @entity38 declared @entity39 a republic and abolished the caliphate system			2
while the @entity42 , a small @entity1 religious movement , has claimed a spiritual caliphate for most of the last century and the @entity45 refers to himself as amir @entity46 ( leader of the faithful ) , a term normally reserved for the caliph , since the fall of the @entity34 , no real attempt has been made to re-establish what was lost with the fall of the @entity34			1
the historical significance of the caliphate , therefore , makes this a huge claim , a risky move , and a crucial point in @entity1 's short history			1
its ambition and its professed success may well cause the group as many problems as it does find solutions			0
if the so - called @entity12 ( @entity70 ) fails to gain widespread support from @entity18 , it will lack the legitimacy it so craves			1
according to the binary jihadist doctrine of @entity76 -- seeing the world as @entity20 or @entity74 will either be seen as the caliph worthy of following or as an imposter worthy of fighting			1
if you were to follow the revolutionary @entity83 doctrine of groups such as @entity85 , and yet not consider the new caliphate legitimate , " is " is an infidel state that must be removed			0
if " is " were to follow the letter of their own ideology , it would have to punish all rebellion with death			0
for " is , " legitimacy will be gained through exploitation of religion , political manipulation of historical narratives , and the violent quashing of dissent			0
@entity102 infighting is guaranteed over the coming months and @entity5 and @entity4 's future looks even bloodier than the last 11 years			2
on top of these @entity107 disagreements , the so - called caliphate will struggle in much the same way as other pretenders to @entity1 statehood have over the last 50 years			1
" is " will have difficulty implementing a narrow jihadist interpretation of @entity29 , replete with barbaric punishments for dissenters , as state law			0
it is building hospitals and has established a radio station , but will likely fail to deliver any meaningful level of social justice in @entity4 and @entity5 society			0
it also faces a well - organized counter-offensive from the @entity4 army in @entity8 and any level of military loss would immediately undermine the legitimacy of the new caliph			2
in much the same way as governments worldwide , " is " will quickly learn that opposition is a much easier position to hold than government			0
it is clear from this declaration that @entity74 has over-estimated the level of support that he has among @entity18			0
he will hope that his declaration will lead to more @entity18 in @entity4 and @entity5 pledging allegiance to him			0
this must also be seen in conjunction with the group 's media and social media strategy to engage increasing numbers of @entity18 around the world and , thereby , boost their recruitment of foreign fighters			0
a further factor affecting support for @entity1 will be the reception of this declaration in countries like @entity156 and @entity157 ( whose rulers are considered to be the direct descendants of the @entity26 ) and in @entity161 or @entity162 , where sectarian chaos and destabilization could be the result , given " is 's " continued rhetoric about the lack of legitimacy of existing muslim - majority countries			1
if more foreign fighters flock to join " is , " they are likely to stay there in the short term			0
opinion : how to keep @entity1 terror from @entity177 shores the worry for the rest of the world is that , if " is " manages to consolidate its territory and preserve its legitimacy , an offensive jihad against all other countries will then be considered viable			2
most interesting though will be the reaction of @entity76			1
although it is clear from statements by its leader @entity192 in february and may that @entity76 would remain distinct from @entity1 , the claim of the caliphate 's establishment will change the dynamic of this relationship , and may prompt the leaders of some of the regional affiliates to change their allegiance from @entity200 to @entity201			1
@entity76 will now want to challenge @entity1 's appropriation of its key objectives and tactics			1
the only way for @entity76 to stay relevant now is through a violent and spectacular attack			2
although @entity1 may eventually be a victim of its own success , the real victims will be the thousands of innocent @entity18 and non-muslims caught in the crossfire of this millennarian struggle			2

@entity1 leader has declared re-establishment of the caliphate , and appointed himself its caliph
significance of caliphate makes this huge claim , risky move , and crucial point in @entity1 's short history - @entity227
@entity227 : so - called caliphate will struggle as other pretenders to @entity1 statehood have over the last 50 years
most interesting though will be the reaction of @entity76 , he adds
