@entity0 -- @entity3 's bipolar swings between nuclear provocation and fawning overtures for talks now form part of a familiar pattern			1
as recently as march , @entity9 was warning the @entity10 of " a simmering nuclear war " and cut its hotline with @entity13			0
but in the past week , media reports say it has been taking down the ubiquitous @entity17 billboards that line the streets of the @entity3 capital , suggesting that dialogue , after all , may be possible			0
the well - worn formula of ratcheting up the tension and then standing back to see what concessions can be extracted from a rattled international community was a favored tactic of @entity27 's father @entity26 who was a master of brinkmanship			0
but with @entity30 and @entity3 holding strategic talks in @entity32 on wednesday , analysts are asking whether this time , everything could be different			1
@entity34 , project director at the @entity35 , says that while there are new elements to the discourse between @entity3 and the international community , little of substance has changed			0
" it seems to be the usual dance where we are in the charm offensive period and @entity3 is reaching out for talks , " @entity34 said , adding that @entity3 was fully conscious that each party to the previous six - party talks between @entity3 , @entity13 , @entity30 , the @entity10 , @entity43 and @entity44 had been pursuing their agenda			1
" i think it 's plausible that @entity3 is trying to see if they can divide some of the six parties because they realize that the @entity30 are looking for talks primarily and i think they realize that the @entity10 wants conditions for talks			1
" the @entity10 has previously stated that concrete movement on @entity3 's @entity58 obligations to de-nuclearize were a pre-condition of talks			1
she said the feeling in @entity62 , however , was that the @entity10 was not rushing towards talks			2
" i think that @entity30 , meanwhile , wants to inflict limited pain on @entity3 to get them to cease provocations and to get back to talks and to frankly stop making @entity30 lose face , " she said			1
@entity30 -- which committed as many three million troops to secure @entity3 during the @entity68 in the 1950s -- is @entity9 's closest ally but has grown increasingly impatient with its @entity72 neighbor , repeatedly urging it to rejoin the six - party negotiations			1
@entity34 said there was a sense that @entity3 had overplayed its hand			0
" this escalation and brinkmanship was n't done with any of the calibration that we 're used to seeing during the @entity26 era , which managed to ( provoke ) but gave @entity30 the ability to maintain its position , " she said			0
nevertheless , she said the sense in @entity30 was that @entity3 was a wayward child and had to be brought into line and part of this could be urging the @entity10 to adopt a more flexible position on talks			1
" their ( @entity30 's ) anger over @entity3 is very different from our anger , " she added			1
" @entity32 believes that @entity3 's insecurity needs to be alleviated , not intensified			1
" @entity96 , associate professor of @entity97 at @entity98 in @entity99 , said the fact that other six - party members were talking with each other -- notably the @entity10 and @entity13 and most recently @entity30 and the @entity10 -- was making @entity9 apprehensive			2
" they 've been taken aback by this series of summit meetings , " @entity96 said			0
" they do n't want to be pushed into a corner and i think that 's what they 're feeling at this juncture especially since @entity113 has been very adamant about the de-nuclearization of @entity3			2
" he said that recent rhetoric coming out of @entity3 showed the regime to be increasingly desperate			0
" i do believe that the regime is extremely unstable and insecure , therefore it 's making all these frantic efforts , " @entity96 said			0
" even them wanting to hang on to nuclear weapons is an act of desperation as well -- they believe it 's the only thing that would ensure the regime 's survival			0
" @entity30 is currently banking on its provinces bordering @entity3 -- known as the @entity128 -- becoming a new economic zone and is plowing billions into infrastructure development in the region			2
@entity96 said @entity30 believes that part of the reason that the zone has not been as successful as planned has been due to @entity3			2
" to develop that whole region is something that @entity30 very much wants to kick - start , " he said			0
" now there are voices within @entity30 raising the question , ' why are we holding onto this relic regime which is going against @entity30 's national interests ? ' " " i do n't ' think we 're looking at a major overhaul of @entity30 's @entity3 policy but i think they are beginning to think of the possibility of ' what if ? ' and how will this play out as far as @entity30 's economic development is concerned			2
