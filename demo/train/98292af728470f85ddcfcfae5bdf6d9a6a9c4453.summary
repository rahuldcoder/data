-- train wrecks are intrinsically spectacular , and @entity3 's new movie offers a doozy			1
two of them , in fact			0
@entity7 and @entity3 star in " @entity8			1
" in the first , @entity7 's genial public relations guy @entity9 is sitting in his car , snarled in traffic and oblivious to the locomotive bearing down on him until it 's almost too late			0
fortunately for @entity9 , @entity8 ( @entity3 ) is on the case			1
using his @entity16 - like powers , @entity8 flips @entity9 's car up and over in a neat backward somersault , safely out of harm 's way			1
at the same time he thrusts out his arm and stops the train in its tracks			0
while @entity9 is grateful , the guy in the car underneath his is n't so sure -- and the damage to the derailed train stretches back a half - mile or more			1
that 's the train wreck within the movie			0
the train wreck that is the movie is even more interesting			0
we all know that @entity3 " owns " the july 4 weekend -- so much so , there are n't any other big openings this week ( aside from the small - scale " @entity33 , " which began in limited release last week )			1
since " @entity34 " he 's virtually become synonymous with @entity35			0
and he makes it look so easy , too			0
" @entity8 " tinkers with that self - confidence a little bit			1
apparently immortal and impervious to pain , @entity8 fulfills the superhero 's brief -- he safeguards the citizenry of @entity44 -- but he 's sunk well below complacency into an alcoholic stew of resentment and contempt for his public			1
when a young fan stirs him from a drunken stupor to chase some bad guys in the movie 's opening scene , @entity8 sends him off with an insult : " what do you want , a cookie ? " later , he picks up an obnoxious kid who has pushed his luck too far and flings him into the stratosphere , catching him 30 seconds later with obvious reluctance			1
in short , this is not the agreeable @entity3 we know and love , and even in this summer of edgier , angrier action heroes ( see also " @entity67 " and " @entity68 " ) , @entity8 may be the first full - blown jerk to front a blockbuster			1
ireport.com : share your review of " @entity8 " but before you jump to conclusions , this is not the problem with the movie			2
though the cynical , adult edge to the comedy may limit the film 's audience ( it is rated @entity82 ) it also qualifies as a welcome change			2
@entity8 's reckless heroism -- and the wreckage he leaves in his wake -- inspires the film 's funniest stuff ( which is why you 've probably seen it all in the trailers )			1
cussing , pulling on a bottle of booze as he chases down bad guys and dressing like a wino , @entity3 has fun playing against type , and in possibly his best big - screen performance yet , @entity7 makes an engaging comic foil			1
like " @entity99 " patriarch mr. @entity99 before him , @entity8 has alienated the authorities with his diy approach to problem - solving			2
they even issue a warrant for his arrest			0
@entity9 -- who owes the guy his life and has invited him into his home to meet the wife ( @entity111 ) -- encourages @entity8 to surrender himself , serve some time , address his alcohol and anger - management issues , and wait for soaring crime statistics to pave his early release			2
it 's when this scenario plays out that @entity119 's movie jumps the tracks			0
writers @entity121 and @entity123 have concocted an outrageous , mind - boggling twist that comes so far out of left field you would need a crystal ball to see it coming			0
no spoilers here , but it does n't work , not in the short term and not in the big picture either			0
it 's as if we 've been whisked from one kind of movie -- a brisk , superficial but entertaining high - concept comedy -- and into the theater next door , where they 're showing some sort of tragic " x-men " knockoff			2
the last half - hour of this 92 - minute movie is a fiasco			1
@entity119 's shaky - cam technique does n't help , nor does a weak , inadequate villain ( played by @entity149 )			2
still , it 's rare -- and startling -- to see a big - budget movie fall apart so dramatically			0
whether it was inspired by ego or economics , more than anything the turnaround feels like a colossal collective failure of nerve			0
" @entity8 " will likely post strong long weekend figures , but just watch those numbers plummet as the word gets out			1
a superhero can overcome many things , but not a movie that goes off the rails			2
" @entity8 " is rated @entity82 and runs 92 minutes .			0

@entity0 's @entity167 : " @entity8 " starts strong , goes off rails
film about *truculent* superhero takes odd turn for last half - hour
