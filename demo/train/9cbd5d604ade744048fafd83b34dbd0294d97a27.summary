-- doctors say secretary of state @entity2 is on her way to a full recovery after a blood clot was found in her head on sunday night			1
she was discharged from @entity8 on wednesday after spending three days being treated , the @entity7 announced			0
@entity10 's blood clot was located in the vein between the brain and skull behind her right ear , according to her doctors ' statement			1
it is being treated with blood thinners and did not result in a stroke or any neurological damage			2
this type of blood clot is called a cerebral vein thrombosis and is relatively rare , said dr. @entity26 , director of the @entity27 at the @entity28 and chair of the @entity31 's subcommittee on quality of care			1
a two - year study conducted in the @entity35 found cerebral vein thrombosis affects approximately 1 in every 100,000 people			1
in comparison , the @entity38 says 1 in 1,000 people are affected by deep venous thrombosis ( @entity42 ) -- a similar clot found most often in the leg			1
@entity10 , now 65 , suffered from a @entity42 in 1998			1
anyone who has had a blood clot in the past is at a higher risk of getting one again			1
about one - third of people with @entity42 will have a recurrence within 10 years , according to the @entity38			0
" there are a handful of genetic conditions that predispose someone to these kinds of clots , " @entity26 said			2
" that 's why you might see two different ( types of blood clots ) in the same person			2
" it 's unknown if @entity10 has a genetic condition that may increase her risk			1
other risk factors for @entity42 include smoking , use of oral contraceptives , age ( the risk increases over age 65 ) and obesity			0
blood clots : 4 things you need to know a large long - term study published in the journal @entity79 in 2007 found the more frequently a person travels , the higher their risk of blood clots			1
the blood in veins is fighting gravity to get back to the heart , @entity26 said , and needs the leg muscles to help push it along			0
when a person is sedentary for long periods of time -- especially on a plane or in a car where the legs are in the same position for hours -- the blood can start to clot			2
@entity10 has logged many miles as secretary of state , in addition to the time spent traveling as a former presidential candidate and first lady			2
although she plans to step down from the @entity7 soon , there is a lot of speculation about a run for president in 2016			0
blood clots would n't deter her from campaigning if that 's what she chooses , said dr. @entity116 , an expert in thrombosis at @entity118 who is not involved in @entity10 's care			1
" travel is potentially an issue for the secretary , but i would imagine that when she travels she 's not sitting in a coach seat , cramped up and sitting still , " @entity116 said			0
experts recommend anyone with a history of blood clots stand up and walk every couple hours during long trips			0
they should also avoid alcoholic drinks prior to traveling -- dehydration can contribute to the formation of blood clots			0
doctors often recommend wearing compression stockings , which help move blood along in the legs by narrowing the veins			0
@entity10 may remain on blood thinners for several months or for the foreseeable future , said dr. @entity139 , chief of vascular surgery at @entity141 , who is not treating the secretary of state			1
" the current recommendations are for at least three months of treatment with a blood thinner following a clot			2
each case much be individualized depending on the size and location of the clot and the risk of bleeding as a result of the treatment , " @entity139 said			2
often patients on these medications are monitored closely , having their blood checked once a month or every couple of months to ensure the dosage is right			0
@entity139 makes his patients aware of typical blood clot symptoms ( sudden pain or swelling in the limbs , or chest pain and shortness of breath caused by a blood clot traveling toward the lungs ) so they can spot them and get treated quickly			1
patients on blood thinners need to avoid physical trauma , @entity26 said , but are otherwise fine			0
so while an @entity174 player or a construction worker would probably be out , @entity10 's career going forward is still full of possibilities			1
" i think her future is as good as her past , " @entity116 said			0
" she should recover fully and get back to work			0
" @entity0 's @entity182 , @entity183 and @entity184 contributed to this report .			0
