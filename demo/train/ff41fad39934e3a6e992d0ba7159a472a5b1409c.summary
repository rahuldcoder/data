-- one morning about 25 years ago the telephone rang at home			2
" is this @entity3 ? " " yes			1
well , this is @entity5 , and this is one of those weird sunday morning phone calls			1
you gave such a great speech at @entity10 ' funeral			2
i just wondered if we could have lunch sometime			2
" " yes we could ! " i replied			2
@entity10 was @entity14 , a remarkable character and a good friend of mine who had been an agent at @entity19			2
when he died of @entity21 in 1987 , @entity14 's clients included @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 and @entity26			2
before that , he had been @entity28 ' executive assistant			1
apparently @entity5 had never had a chance to say a proper good - bye to our mutual friend ; our lunch would be sort of a stand - in for that missing farewell			1
a luncheon invitation from one of the most exciting people in show business was irresistible			2
this was a man who had been a star of stage and film continuously since he had helped to inaugurate an eye - opening decade in 1960 with his celebrated two - person show with @entity46 on @entity47			2
eventually he would win nine @entity48 for his theater work , plus various @entity50 , emmys and @entity51			2
a few weeks later , i biked over to @entity28 ' house on the @entity54 and we went around the corner to a little @entity58 restaurant -- and stayed there from 2 o'clock until 6 o'clock			1
@entity5 bummed one cigarette after another from the waiters , as we talked above love , sex , drugs , show business and our friend @entity10			1
his romance with @entity68 was still new , and he explained how they had met over the @entity70 on the @entity71			2
@entity68 was then a correspondent for " @entity72 , " and she had called him a week later to ask if she could profile him for the tv show			2
" no , " said @entity28			1
" but we could have dinner			0
" and then they were off			0
the prolific director of theater and film was especially pleased when i told him how much i had loved " streamers , " the @entity83 play about young men going off to @entity85 that he had directed at @entity86 10 years earlier , and " @entity87 , " @entity89 's great play about love and marriage , which won @entity28 one of his @entity48 for its direction			1
as he was for so many people my age around the world , he had been my hero since he had held up a brilliant mirror to our generation with " @entity99 " in 1967 ( for which he won an @entity50 ) and before that with his astonishing debut as a film director , " who 's afraid of @entity106 ? " -- " a directing debut like few others in the history of @entity111 film , " as @entity101 wrote on thursday			1
" did @entity112 give her finest performance in ' @entity106 ' because she was playing herself ? " i asked , over the rigatoni			0
" oh no. " @entity28 replied			1
" she 's not a person ! it 's not her fault -- she 's been a movie star since she was 10 ! " the strange thing about our lunch was , @entity14 was gay , and i was gay , and @entity28 knew that			1
but he peppered the conversation with odd , homophobic remarks like , " most gay people you know are n't really all that smart			0
" when we finally said good - bye after four hours of repartee , i felt i had to challenge him			0
" i did n't really appreciate all those homophobic remarks , " i said			0
" well , " he replied , with that permanent twinkle in his eye , " i could have made a pass at you instead			0
" " well , " said @entity135 , " that would have been much worse ! " after that i ran into him here and there -- most recently at @entity140 's funeral -- and he was always friendly			0
but we never had lunch again			0
fast forward to the @entity143 last july			0
this was where @entity28 had opened half a century ago in " @entity146 and @entity46			1
" in this partly improvised tour de force , the two of them imitated everything from a mother pillorying her scientist son for neglecting her to a clueless nurse in a feverish emergency room			0
this time he was there to be interviewed onstage by @entity47 director @entity156 for an @entity158 documentary being produced by @entity101			1
@entity156 and @entity28 had already done several hours of filmed interviews , but without an audience , and there had n't been much sparkle			1
only when he was in front of the packed theater did the director with the soul of a performer suddenly come alive			1
@entity28 looked thin and rather frail , but his words were mesmerizing , and for an hour and a half his audience was spellbound			1
he picked up where we had left off at lunch , telling amazing stories about " @entity99 " and " @entity106 " : how @entity174 had become the soundtrack for " @entity99 " because his brother happened to give him one of their albums while he was filming it , and he suddenly realized that several of the songs were a perfect fit for some of the scenes he had already shot			1
eventually he told the singers they would have to write one song just for the movie			0
they demurred for just a moment , then launched into a rousing version of " mrs. @entity189			0
" " how did you do that ? " @entity28 asked			1
" well , " @entity193 replied , " i 'd been working on a new song : here 's to you , mrs. @entity195 ! " @entity28 said he had only realized late in life that the plot of " @entity99 " was really " @entity199 , " the 17th century masterpiece by @entity201 : " a story that comes back in every generation			1
" he had also decided that there are only three kinds of scenes in any drama : " seductions , negotiations and fights			0
" he had had to fight @entity211 , who wanted " @entity106 " to be made in color			0
but @entity28 knew it had to be black and white			1
the most important lesson he had learned from the first movie he made was " how beautiful black - and - white is			0
it 's a metaphor automatically , already saying , this is not life , it 's about life			0
i was excited about that			0
" he said one reason he had never written anything about his life was that he only knew how to print ; he had never been able to write script			0
but he was always happy to be interviewed about his many accomplishments			0
when i got home that night i sent @entity28 an email : " having had that experience once before for four hours , i knew you would be amazing			1
but you were more than amazing this evening			0
not just a once - in - a - lifetime night in the theater : a lesson in life			0
" i was delighted when he wrote back : " thanks , @entity3 , for your extremely kind words			1
it was tricky talking about self but @entity156 was so generous and loving he made it ok			0
" it turned out to be his final performance			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity3 .			1

@entity3 *recalls* two encounters with *legendary* director @entity5
he says @entity28 understood the role of performers because he had been one himself
*kaiser* : @entity28 held a brilliant mirror up to baby boom generation with " @entity99 "
