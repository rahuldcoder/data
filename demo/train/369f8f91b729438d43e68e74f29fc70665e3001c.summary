scientists looking for signs of life in the universe -- as well as another planet like our own -- are a lot closer to their goal than people realize			1
that was the consensus of a panel on the search for life in the universe held at @entity14 headquarters monday in @entity15			1
the discussion focused not only on the philosophical question of whether we 're alone in the universe but also on the technological advances made in an effort to answer that question			2
" we believe we 're very , very close in terms of technology and science to actually finding the other @entity31 and our chance to find signs of life on another world , " said @entity22 , a @entity23 and professor of planetary science and physics at the @entity27			1
" finding @entity31 's twin , that 's kind of the holy grail , " said @entity36 , an astronaut who helped repair the @entity37 in 2009 and is now an associate administrator at @entity14			1
strides in the search for life scientists have made stellar strides in the past few years alone			1
" we already know that our galaxy has at least 100 billion planets , and we did n't know that five years ago , " said @entity48 , director of the @entity49 in @entity50			0
he credited the work of the @entity52 for these new discoveries			0
the planet - hunting @entity52 probe , launched in 2009 , finds planets by looking for dips in the brightness of a star as a planet transits , or crosses , in front of that star			0
@entity52 also found the first @entity31 - size planet that orbits in a star 's habitable zone , the area around a star where a planet could exist with liquid water on its surface			1
the @entity52 mission builds upon the stalwart @entity37 , which launched in 1990 and was the first of its kind to be placed in space			0
as @entity37 orbits the @entity31 , it allows scientists to peer back in time , into distant galaxies , and yields stunning images of the cosmos			1
@entity37 has helped shape our awareness of our planet 's place in an ever - changing universe			2
the @entity31 , though 4.5 billion years old , is a newcomer , said @entity90 , senior project scientist on @entity14 's next - generation @entity91			1
it 's only about one - third of the age of the universe			2
and our galaxy is ever - evolving , with " about five or 10 new stars being born per year in our @entity96 , " @entity90 said			0
planet hunters @entity37 's astounding views come from a vantage point only 353 miles above our @entity31			1
in comparison , the @entity91 telescope will be a whopping 930,000 miles from our planet			0
that 's close to four times the distance between the @entity31 and the moon			2
@entity91 is set to launch in 2018			0
@entity48 , who is the telescope scientist for @entity91 , said scientists now know where every single star is within 200 light years of the @entity110 @entity14 's assembled panelists said , if they follow this map of stars , they 're certain to find a multitude of new planets			1
" every star in the sky is a sun , and if our sun has planets , we naturally expect those other stars to have planets also , and they do , " said @entity22			0
she said if someone looked up at a starry sky and wondered how many of the stars have planets , the answer would be " basically every single one			0
" some of a star 's light will shine through the atmosphere , said @entity22 , and the @entity91 telescope should be able to pick up gases from the planet that are imprinted on the atmosphere			0
while the @entity91 telescope was n't designed to find signs of life on another planet , it can spot biosignature gases -- gases in the atmosphere produced by life			2
@entity22 said , with the @entity91 telescope , " we have our first chance , our first capability of finding signs of life on another planet			0
now nature just has to provide for us			0
" spotting @entity31 finding small planets , ones the size of @entity31 , is challenging , in part because they produce fainter signals , said @entity156 , director for astronomy and physics at @entity14 's @entity159 , who likened it to spotting a firefly beside a searchlight			1
that difficulty does n't dull the hunt for another @entity31 or signs of life			2
@entity14 administrator @entity167 said he counts himself among the people who " are probably convinced that it 's highly improbable in the limitless vastness of the universe that we humans stand alone			1
