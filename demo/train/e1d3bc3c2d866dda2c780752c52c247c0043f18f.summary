-- actress @entity1 says world leaders are discovering how " mindfulness " helps with stress -- but that she despairs at seeing young stars like @entity5 struggling to deal with fame			1
@entity1 spoke to @entity0 at the @entity8 in @entity9 , where she had led a session on the power of neuroscience and mindfulness to " change the world			1
" @entity1 , star of films including " @entity17 , " " the @entity18 " and " the @entity19 " -- for which she won an @entity20 -- is also the founder of @entity21			1
@entity1 said when she started her foundation 12 years ago , mindfulness had been a " what is that " concept , but she was optimistic that was changing			1
" it 's extraordinary that this @entity9 this year seems to be centered a lot around the brain , a lot around stress reduction , mindfulness , all of these areas , " she said			1
" they 're all coming out of the closet now , it 's like they 've all been meditating -- so many of them -- for 20 years and so forth			2
so it 's beginning to happen -- mindful leadership			1
" @entity1 explained how she believed a healthy mind could lead to healthy decision making			2
" when the brain is silent , the executive function , which is this part of the brain that makes decisions can work much better			0
so when you get quiet you make better decisions , you 're also more rested -- you 're not as reactive , " she said			0
" so it 's actually great for the economy , great for our leadership and our thought leaders			2
" when asked about @entity5 , the @entity54 pop star facing allegations of driving under the influence and drag racing , @entity1 said his situation was " heartbreaking			1
" the @entity20 - winning actress , who was accompanied by a @entity61 monk at @entity9 to speak to business leaders about meditation , recalled the challenges of her own early success			1
" it was very stressful			0
i was away from home			0
it happened overnight for me and i really became anxious around it , " she said			0
" i sought help because i wanted to find out why i was n't as happy as i should have been , or excited , but i did n't understand why people were asking me for my autograph			0
" but @entity1 said she had n't been attracted to drugs and her situation in the sixties had been different from that faced by the current generation of young celebrities			2
" it actually breaks my heart because i know what 's going on , " she said			2
" now they 're self - medicating and this is the most dangerous thing for them			0
" talent , sweetness , ability to manage -- what good they could be doing , how happy they could be feeling			0
and as a mother -- and a grandmother now -- all i want to do is hold them			0
