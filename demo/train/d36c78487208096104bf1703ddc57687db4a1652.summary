-- one of the key questions asked after any serious airline incident is , how do we stop this happening again ? @entity4 has changed its cockpit regulations as a result of flight 370 's disappearance			1
many other incidents in the past have led to safer flying conditions for us today , as a result of improvements and changes to protocol , laws and technology in planes			1
below we outline some of the most important ones			2
these helped pave the way to making 2013 one of the safest years in aviation history according to the @entity23 , with only 29 known accidents worldwide and 265 fatalities ( the 10 - year average is 720 fatalities per year )			2
collision avoidance systems @entity28 have been a priority in the aerospace industry since the inception of flight			1
in 1956 , a @entity34 jet crashed into a @entity36 flight above the @entity37			1
the incident was the first of many that illustrated the need for increased communication between planes			1
a few years later , the @entity44 was formed to set guidelines for aviation in the @entity47 , but still , issues remained			1
several other two - plane accidents -- including a 1996 collision near @entity51 that resulted in 349 casualties -- emphasized the need for advanced anti-collision technology			1
after a congressional ruling in 1991 , the @entity44 implemented the @entity56 and @entity28 , which monitors the airspace around an aircraft independent of air traffic control			1
" @entity66 really came about in the late ' 90s , and since then , i do n't think we 've really seen a collision between two airlines , " noted @entity60 , president and coo of the @entity62 , a consultancy that offers analysis and advice to the aviation industry			1
and the world 's safest airline is ... 2			2
roomier seats coach may seem pretty crammed these days , but according to @entity75 , there 's a limit to how much plane manufacturers are allowed to shave off the space around seats			2
in fact , modern - day seat layout has been rigorously calculated to carry out the most effective evacuation			2
this is in part thanks to research carried out by the @entity86 after a 1985 incident when a @entity88 737 caught fire before takeoff at @entity91			2
an engine caught fire , and the flames spread quickly			0
unfortunately , the lack of space between seats meant that bottle - necking occurred at the doors , and some passengers could n't escape			0
" the aisles became jammed with people panicking to exit , and there literally was n't enough space between the seats , " @entity60 recalled			0
" now , there are limits in terms of the minimum space between seats as well as the distance to an emergency exit			0
weather radar severe weather has played a role in some crashes , most notably that of @entity118 , which crashed in 1985 while approaching @entity119 in a thunderstorm			1
" @entity121 is one thing , but if a pilot gets into wind shear and the currents are there , it will literally just push your aircraft onto the ground			1
there have been some incidents where aircraft have crashed when making their final approach , " @entity60 said			1
in 1981 , the @entity44 required all turbine - powered commercial planes be installed with wind shear detection systems by 1993			1
since then , the models have become increasingly sophisticated			0
" a lot of the more advanced weather radar do n't just detect bad weather but predict wind shear			0
if a pilot sees wind shear coming , instead of landing , he can circle around the airport until it disappears			0
" language of air travel : how traffic control keeps you safe 4			0
manual training it took two years for search parties to recover the black box from @entity155 , which crashed into the @entity156 en route to @entity158 from @entity159			1
on reviewing the recordings , the @entity161 @entity160 blamed pilot error , in particular an overdependence on the automated flight control system			0
" the senior captain was on his break , and the aircraft was being piloted by two less experienced pilots , " recalled @entity60			1
" since then , @entity171 and @entity172 have both changed their operation procedures and have put more focus on manual training			1
" in the wake of the incident , @entity176 also revamped its training procedures and introduced a " gatekeeper " position			0
gatekeepers are tasked with contacting the flight crew in the event of an incident and providing pilots with on - the - spot training , tools and advice			1
retiring old planes the @entity44 addressed the issue of how long planes should fly in 1988 when it created the @entity194 , which monitors the structural integrity of older planes			1
the measure was a result of an @entity200 accident			2
while flying at 24,000 feet , a large section of the roof blew off , leaving passengers flying in the open air			0
the plane -- a @entity172 -- was 19 years old , and investigators blamed the incident on the plane 's age - related wear and tear			0
@entity212 's new swimsuit safety video : fun or offensive ? 6			0
reviewing repairs when it comes to making repairs to old aircraft , airlines have also become increasingly stringent			2
this is mainly the result of @entity221 , which crashed in the mountains 62 miles from @entity223			1
the crash was the result of a poorly executed repair made several years earlier			2
" the repair covered a crack in the bulkhead , but many hundreds of flights later , it corroded , and the air pressure bulkhead just burst open , " recalled @entity60			0
@entity172 responded by monitoring its repairs more closely			0
" after that , the types of repairs allowed on an aircraft skin were much more rigorously controlled , " @entity60 said			0
retrieving data both the @entity176 447 crash and the more recent incident involving @entity239 have spotlighted the need for better access to data			0
" there were several recommendations stemming from @entity155 , mainly centered around the flight data recorders and , more specifically , on ensuring the ability to locate them more easily and quickly , " said @entity243 , communications officer for the @entity244			1
in the aftermath of the @entity176 incident , the agency published a notice of a proposed amendment to retire older recording technologies and recommended that cockpit voice recorders have a minimum recording duration of two hours			0
unfortunately , it may be a while before the necessary changes are implemented			0
" changes to regulations do take time			2
it 's taken almost two decades for aircraft to be manufactured and older aircraft to be modified to have a system that means an empty fuel tank ca n't explode on an aircraft , " @entity60 pointed out .			0

after *disaster* , new tech and performance regulations prevent the same thing *recurring*
the @entity44 was formed as a result of a collision between two planes in 1956
after @entity155 crashed , many airlines changed how pilots are trained
