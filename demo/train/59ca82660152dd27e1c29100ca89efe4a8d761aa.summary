-- contactless payments are poised to radically change the landscape for businesses and consumers across @entity5 , according to the ceo of @entity7			1
known as " wave and pay " or " tap and go , " cashless and contactless payments are a way of paying for everyday items like a newspaper or a cup of coffee simply by swiping your card , or increasingly your cell phone , across a reader			1
the concept is built around saving time for the user , so they do n't need to rummage around in pockets or bags for wallets and purses			0
@entity28 , ceo of @entity7 , predicts the fast - paced movement of the technology around cashless payments will overtake more conventional methods in the next decade			1
" i 've made this prediction that by 2020 , more than 50 % of our transactions are going to be on mobile phones , " he said			1
" for 50 years we 've had the piece of plastic			0
ok , it 's developed , it 's been more secure , we 've added features to it and everything else , but for 50 years i 've carried a piece of plastic around			0
" now , suddenly , i 've realized that in the future , i do n't have to have that piece of plastic , it 's on this wonderful smartphone			1
so radically that changes your thinking			0
" @entity28 says that in future other ways of paying may give way to the phone as the payment method of choice			1
" we 'll never go cashless , because people will always choose how they want to pay			2
if they want to pay by cash , if they want to pay by card in the future , that 's absolutely fine with me			1
" but what we 're trying to do , is say : ' there 's a much more convenient way to pay			0
' " the revolution requires putting in place a whole new set of financial infrastructure at banks and retailers to facilitate the new way to pay			1
" we 're the enabler , " said @entity28			0
" you 've got to get every retailer to kind of change their front - end systems so they can accept contactless payment , " he said			2
" you 've then got to get every bank to start issuing contactless cards			2
you 've got to work with the mobile - phone operators , and the hand - set providers to really put all that infrastructure in place			1
" nothing in payments happens quickly			2
" @entity28 said the changes do n't come cheap either			0
" it is costly ; it is time consuming to get it all in place			2
but every now and again you see an opportunity that you think : this is such a fantastic opportunity , and we really really must leverage it			0
" tough economic times in @entity5 mean consumers are even more aware of what they are spending , but they are also creating a focus on how money is spent , according to @entity28			0
" the consumer is being very careful about what they 're spending nowadays , " he said			0
" but what 's happening , is the consumer is moving away from inefficient forms of payment , like using the check , like using cash , to the much more convenient and efficient ways of paying			0
" look out -- the contactless revolution could be coming to a retailer near you .			1
