@entity0 , @entity1 -- a long line snaked around the perimeter of a large hotel conference room as people waited eagerly to meet a former @entity8 congressman who they view as an icon in the modern libertarian movement			2
@entity11 had finished delivering a nearly hour - long speech to a gathering of @entity1 libertarians on friday night , and he was now signing copies of books , t - shirts , posters and even a few paintings			2
@entity11 might have retired from @entity20 last year , but he has n't gone away quietly			1
the eclectic group of activists who backed the @entity8 @entity23 in his back - to - back presidential runs still support him even as it appears many of them are ready to turn to his son , @entity29 sen. @entity27 , if he follows in his dad 's footsteps and runs for president in 2016			1
@entity27 , who was elected in 2010 , has quickly become a national figure in his own right due to his willingness to buck traditional @entity23 ideology , and a strong following among young , libertarian minded voters and self - described " tea party " activists			1
@entity27 's appeal among the grassroots has helped rank him , according to early polling , as a top contender for the @entity23 presidential nomination if he runs			1
and unlike his father , @entity27 is more closely aligned with the @entity23 establishment			1
but as @entity27 's star continues to rise , where does he stand among @entity11 's most ardent supporters ? while a few attendees at the conference argued @entity27 is too moderate , many say he strikes the right balance that the movement needs — a pragmatic choice to its principled core			1
or as @entity58 , a 29 - year - old from @entity59 , put it : " @entity27 is running the company , and @entity11 's chairman of the board			1
" walking a fine line it 's clear many @entity11 supporters do n't view @entity27 as a replacement for his father			1
in their eyes , @entity11 is still the trailblazing legend that sparked a libertarian resurgence			2
@entity27 : will his star continue to rise ? to the movement , " he 's the intellectual godfather , " said conference attendee @entity71 , 44 , of @entity73			2
but in multiple conversations , conference attendees said they thought that @entity27 's plan is to spread the so - called liberty message in a more strategic way than his father 's vocal and largely - purist method			1
in @entity11 's 2008 and 2012 presidential bids , he unabashedly called for an end to the @entity84 and other huge areas of government that many @entity87 consider necessary			2
the son 's tactical approach has some @entity11 supporters concerned that he will compromise his libertarian positions			1
in the past year , @entity27 has taken heat for his stance on @entity95 leaker @entity94 , who is praised as a hero by many in the libertarian movement , including @entity11 's father			1
but @entity27 says @entity94 still broke the law and should serve time in prison , even though he credits the ex-agency contractor for disclosing important information			2
@entity27 addressed the @entity1 summit sunday morning live via video link			2
the event was hosted by @entity108 , an organization founded by @entity11 in 2008			0
during @entity27 's brief video session to the conference — a vastly smaller audience than the crowd that turned out for his father 's speech friday night — @entity27 was asked by an attendee what he thinks should be an appropriate sentence for @entity94			1
while the senator has previously said @entity94 deserves " a few years " in prison , he said sunday he has " mixed emotions " and he does n't know what kind of penalty @entity94 should get			0
but he argued whistleblowers should have more protections under the law and joked that @entity94 and director of national intelligence @entity127 should share the same prison cell			0
browse through the vast web of blogs and websites that fall under the libertarian umbrella , and you 'll find a number of opinions that say @entity27 's position on @entity94 should come as no surprise , claiming the senator has always been a weak representation of libertarian views			1
some attendees at the conference noted the @entity94 issue was a point of contention but said they can overlook it , in part due to @entity27 's aggressive push against the @entity151 administration over the very data collection programs that @entity94 exposed			2
" you see @entity27 compromise a lot more with @entity23 and @entity157 than you would with @entity11 , " said @entity153 , another conference attendee			1
" but it 's politics			0
you got to play the field a little bit , and he 's willing to play that ball and he 's willing to get our issues and our ideas out into the mainstream			0
that 's what 's important			0
" ' @entity169 ' foreign policy is also an arena in which @entity27 has created concern among some of his father 's supporters			1
@entity11 is a strict non-interventionist			0
he decries foreign aid , including to @entity178 , and wants to rid the world of @entity87 military bases overseas			0
@entity27 takes another step towards @entity183 run " the last thing in the world we need is to be involved in the internal affairs of the other nations , " the former congressman said in his speech friday			0
as seen in @entity27 's position on the recent unrest in @entity194 and @entity196 's annexation of @entity197 , the senator is n't as staunchly opposed to getting involved in other parts of the world			1
while he voted against a $ 1 billion loan guarantee to @entity194 , he still favors technical and security assistance to the country			0
last month , he argued that president @entity151 was failing to project @entity205 's " peace through strength " policy , and he called for the @entity87 to be even more aggressive on its diplomatic efforts relating to @entity196			0
" it is our role as a global leader to be the strongest nation in opposing @entity196 's latest aggression , " he wrote in an opinion piece			0
it 's his evolving stance on foreign policy that @entity11 supporters — at least the ones at this conference — most fear will drive @entity27 too far to the left			1
but @entity23 pundits say it will also be his biggest hurdle to cross in terms of attracting potential donors to a presidential campaign			0
" if @entity27 is serious about running for president , he 's going to have to make peace with ' national security republicans , ' the big donors that care about national security , " said @entity23 strategist @entity227 , adding he 'll need to " distinguish himself from his father " in that regard			1
@entity58 , the conference attendee who also runs a t - shirt company called @entity238 , said if @entity27 trends more mainstream on foreign policy , that shift could become a deal breaker with @entity11 supporters			1
" the liberty movement has to ask itself where is the line in the sand when it comes to being principled and winning , " he said			0
' playing the field ' but @entity27 's differences with his dad are n't the first things on the minds of @entity11 supporters when they think about the senator			1
many are excited that he 's adopted an ambassadorial role and appears to be somewhat effective at attracting more republicans with his libertarian - leaning views			0
he 's been climbing in the 2016 horse race polls in recent months			0
in march , he did what his father never did and took the top spot in a @entity2 / @entity265 survey			0
he 's boosting his profile with an aggressive travel schedule , headlining @entity23 events across the country and making appearances in liberal hotspots , like the @entity272			2
among 2016 chatter , his name increasingly comes up as a potentially viable candidate , not simply a figurehead for libertarian ideas , as his father was often portrayed in his two @entity183 bids			0
@entity27 fights for felon voting rights @entity280 , executive director of @entity281 , told @entity2 last month that he disagreed that @entity27 's recent outreach will put him at risk of compromising his views			2
rather , he said the senator is simply translating libertarian views in a way that 's more appealing to other voters			0
" he is the son of @entity11			0
he has @entity11 's dna in him , and i think it 's kind of engrained all the way down to who he is , " @entity280 said			2
@entity293 , an 18 - year - old student at @entity294 , disagrees			0
he thinks @entity27 is a lot more moderate than his father , but he added that 's not necessarily a bad thing			1
for many libertarians , he said , they see @entity27 as the movement 's best chance of permeating @entity302 with their views , even if he 's not a pure libertarian			1
" i try to remember to not let the perfect get in the way of the good , " he said .			0
