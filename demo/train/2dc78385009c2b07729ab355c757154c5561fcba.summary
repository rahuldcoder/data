it was an experience like no other			2
as my train from @entity4 slowly traversed over an old iron bridge , i looked at the murky river below			2
a man stood waist - deep in the water casting a net			2
on one side of the river , @entity12			2
on the other , the world 's most isolated country -- @entity15			1
soon , the first @entity15 buildings appeared along with a small , abandoned fairground hidden in the shadow of some houses			1
the train made a sudden stop			2
people flooded a station platform			1
we 'd stopped at @entity25 across the bridge that links @entity27 with the @entity12 border city of @entity29			2
a group of @entity15 border officials in neat uniforms boarded the train , collecting passports from passengers			1
three hours later , the train got moving again			0
green fields surrounded by hills ( mountains make up more than 70 % of @entity15 ) appeared on both sides of the track			1
valleys and flat areas were filled endless fields of rich crops			0
it made me think about the country 's reported chronic food shortages			0
finally , 24 hours after leaving @entity4 , the train arrived in @entity51 , the @entity15 capital and home to more than 3 million people			1
a group of @entity15 guards and minders were waiting -- all foreign visitors and tour groups must be accompanied by guards , who are referred to as " guides " or " officials			1
" i was given a brief introduction on how to behave , and informed of other restrictions and guidelines			0
the @entity15 impose strict rules on what visitors are allowed to photograph , who they can talk to and where they can walk			1
for instance , it 's seen as an insult to crop out hands , feet or head when taking photos of statues or pictures of government leaders or officials			2
the guards also act as human shields between foreign visitors and the @entity15 people			1
they followed me almost everywhere i went			0
it was under these restrictions that i visited the country for a total of nine days in the summer of 2012			0
while there , i found that capturing mundane scenes from people 's daily lives on camera suddenly become extraordinary			2
i 'm told that candid pictures of normal people are usually restricted by the government			1
i photographed all sorts of scenes : pedestrians in @entity51 , topless men playing volleyball , a group of women who sweep the streets and commuters riding on the back of a truck			0
this was often as close as i got to the locals -- any direct contact with the @entity15 people is virtually impossible			1
as well as fear and reservation , and the intimidating scrutiny of the guides , most @entity15 can not understand @entity113			1
chatty guards the guards were a different story			2
one of them , mr. @entity117 , talked			0
he told me about his years in the @entity121 , where he became a major			0
for his loyalty , he said was rewarded with trips to @entity125			0
once , while on a stopover in then @entity127 , he told me he 'd visited the city 's famed @entity128			0
for some @entity15 , the most exotic vacation possible is closer to home -- the coastal town of @entity133 , about 200 kilometers to the east of the capital			1
here , @entity15 looked to be enjoying a laid back summer holiday at the beach			1
minus a few obvious differences , it could have been a scene from another part of @entity141			0
everyone looked relaxed and happy			0
people were swimming , sunbathing and playing ball games			2
small sail boats that had the @entity15 flag printed on their sails were available for hire			1
the stretch of beach i visited was fenced in and @entity154 were allowed to walk around freely within that perimeter			0
this was the closest i could get to ordinary @entity15 people and it was in sharp contrast to the poorer , harsher views of rural life i got during the trip east			1
back in @entity51 , before my departure , there were signs of outside influences slowly emerging			0
there was the city 's first hamburger shop , which the locals refer to as @entity172 's			0
two @entity174 restaurants had also recently opened			0
one of those , a pizza restaurant , was the venue for my last night in the country			0
@entity179 , a woman with a microphone stood engulfed in cigarette smoke			0
she sang one @entity174 classic hit after another -- with almost no accent			0
as in other parts of @entity141 , karaoke is a way of life in @entity15 , usually existing hand in hand with cigarettes and alcohol			1
three young women in tight skirts were running the kitchen , sweating while working with a brand new pizza oven			0
most customers were tourists like me , business people or embassy staff -- the price for a pizza is too high for most @entity15			1
like other @entity15 i 'd met or photographed , i felt from the staff a distinctive curiosity , tinged with a shyness of not knowing how to react to the increasing numbers of visiting foreigners			1
they all seemed genuinely friendly , polite and well educated			0
for me , @entity15 seem to be no different than any other people			1
for details on how to visit @entity15 , including restrictions on entering the country , refer to our guide : how to travel to @entity15 also on @entity216 : @entity217 : road trip to the world 's most heavily armed border gallery : the unseen faces of @entity51			1

@entity224 took candid photos of normal life in @entity15
guards or guides were always close by during the trip
@entity232 : @entity15 seem no different from other people
