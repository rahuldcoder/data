-- the @entity2 lawyer who represented a gang rape victim had his disciplinary hearing for " insulting the @entity5 and disobeying the rules and regulations " of the judiciary postponed to an unspecified date , according to @entity10			1
@entity11 : " i believe i did n't do anything wrong			1
" his client is a teenage rape victim who was sentenced to 200 lashes and six months in prison for violating the kingdom 's strict @entity17 law by being alone with an unrelated man before the rape			1
the attacks took place in @entity23 in march 2006 when the woman was 18 and engaged to be married			2
her seven rapists were sentenced to between two to nine years in prison			0
before the reported postponement wednesday , @entity11 said the rape case had elicited a fierce response , including calls for his beheading			1
" these opinions do n't scare me , but they make me feel a disappointment that there are people who think this way			0
" i wish that those who oppose me could engage in a direct dialogue instead of calling for violence			0
unfortunately , they are still stuck in a culture of closed - mindedness			0
" ahead of the postponement @entity44 , who has two daughters , predicted he would have his revoked license to practice law reinstated and said he would represent the @entity2 woman again			1
the hearing has the power to disbar him			2
" i believe in the system and the law , and i believe i did n't do anything wrong , " @entity11 told @entity0 in a telephone interview from @entity55 on tuesday			1
the @entity2 judge who revoked @entity11 's license last month did so to punish him for speaking to the media about his client , @entity11 said			1
under @entity2 law , women are subject to numerous restrictions , including a strict dress code , a prohibition against driving and a requirement that they get a man 's permission to travel or have surgery			1
in challenging his possible suspension and disbarment , the 36 - year - old attorney said he has received threats on his life from the religious right			0
but the foreign minister 's call for a review of the case -- joined by " many voices " of @entity86 's generation , as he put it -- have been encouraging , he added			1
" young people in all fields are asking for reform , in the judicial system , media and elsewhere , " he said			0
" i belong to a new generation of lawyers who know the law and know how to challenge judges about the law			1
" he said his opponents ' influence is on the wane			0
" they believe that any criticism of the judiciary system is a direct criticism of the @entity17 @entity104 law , and they consider that any criticism is a criticism of religion itself , " he said			0
@entity44 singled out the chief judge in the @entity110 's panel of three judges who revoked his license as being among those who fail to grasp that the world is changing			1
" he 's used to lawyers who accept everything he says without questioning			1
i told him ' you misunderstood the law , your honor ' and he could n't take that			0
" @entity44 said that , from the early 1990s until a few years ago , he was a religious fanatic			0
but he said he rejected extremism during law school and joined with the reformists , accepting human rights cases on a pro bono basis in addition to the commercial work that pays his bills			0
the rape victim 's husband , who has been outspoken in her defense , moved @entity11 to accept her case , he said			1
" i would be disgraced if i sit back and do n't support these people who need me , " he said			0
@entity44 described the woman 's case as unusual only in the attention it has garnered , attention he welcomes			1
" one such case is better than thousands of speeches , lectures and theoretical articles , " he said			2
such cases " speak on behalf of the street and reached out to the ordinary people			0
this is my main reason for defending them			0
" though traditionalist judges and conservative lawyers accuse him of harming the kingdom 's image by talking to the media , young people and reformists have offered their support , especially over the @entity157 , " where people are free to express their views , " @entity11 said			1
" the world is now a small village , " he said			2
" what is happening in a small room can be known within seconds to the whole world			2
" this is not the lawyer 's first challenge to @entity2 ways			1
he also represented a professor accused of holding views that offended @entity17			0
" i defended him , and the king personally intervened " on his behalf , @entity11 said			2
in another case , he sued the religious police , also known as the @entity177 of @entity178 and the @entity179 , after they kidnapped a woman and beat her , " and then we proved that she was innocent			2
