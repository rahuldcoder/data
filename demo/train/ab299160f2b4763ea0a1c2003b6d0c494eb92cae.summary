-- if you lose a leg , insurance will likely cover the cost of your prosthesis			1
if you lose your arm , it 's the same			0
even if you lose your ability to perform sexually , more than likely your @entity9 is covered			0
but if you start to lose your hearing , far too often you are on your own			2
if hearing loss were officially considered a disability , it would rank as the largest disability class in the country			1
some 37 million people suffer from hearing loss , according to the @entity18 , and that number will only grow as the population ages			1
yet most private medical insurance does n't cover the cost of hearing aids			1
while the @entity24 often pays for them , in most cases @entity27 , which covers many more people , does not			1
the @entity29 expanded coverage to include newborn hearing screenings when it passed in 2010 , but that was the single preventive - care expansion related to hearing problems			2
it would take an actual act of @entity35 to change it further			0
only 19 states require that health benefits plans in their states pay for hearing aids ; most cover children only , according to the @entity41			1
only three states require coverage for both children and adults			2
when private insurance does pay , it typically covers the cost of an exam to assess hearing loss , and that 's about it			1
the devices are expensive , sometimes costing in the $ 1,000 to $ 6,000 range -- and that 's per ear			1
perhaps this explains , at least in part , why 75 % to 80 % of adults with hearing loss do not get hearing aids , according to a recent study done by @entity63 , a senior staff audiologist in the @entity64 of the @entity65 in @entity66			1
her study showed the only group that consistently got hearing aids had insurance that paid for them in full			1
hearing aids are considered elective , much like plastic surgery or liposuction			1
but unlike those cosmetic procedures , life without hearing can have devastating effects			2
it can leave people feeling isolated or depressed and may even lead to serious illnesses like dementia			0
it can put their safety at risk			0
" it 's really an invisible disability , " said @entity87 , owner of @entity88 , a @entity89 , @entity90 - based hearing assistance company			2
she got involved in the profession after seeing her father struggle when he started losing his hearing			2
no one was there to really advocate for him , she said			0
" you know , i think it stays invisible in part because of our culture , " she said			0
" my parents ' generation kind of accepted their hearing loss as just a way of life , and they did n't want to fuss with the technology , but ultimately they ended up isolating themselves			1
" people do n't always perceive that they need ( hearing aids ) , because hearing loss comes on gradually			1
usually they are the last person to know			0
eventually , though , we all go through this , " @entity110 said			0
we start losing our hearing as early as our 20s , but most people are n't aware of it -- or they 're in denial			1
" maybe it 's because it makes people think about their mortality , or it makes them feel old , " @entity110 said			0
" i had one 90 - year - old patient who came to me and when i confirmed they did have hearing loss , they said , ' i do n't understand what could have caused this			1
' i had to tell them as we mature , this is a natural part of the process			0
" most people @entity87 talks to are surprised that hearing aids are n't typically covered by insurance			1
she said she thinks that will change as her baby boom generation gets older and needs them more			0
" unlike our parents ' generation , we are not afraid to complain			0
i do think you 'll see a lot more pressure on the government and on private companies to pay for more , " @entity87 said			1
but until then , do n't expect to see this change any time soon			1
" there are 35 other mandated benefits you have to cover , " said @entity150 , vice president of communications for @entity151 , a professional association that represents the health insurance industry			2
" to add something else -- especially with the high cost of health care , which will only continue to go up -- it is going to be a hard argument to make			2
" where the argument might get easier is with children			0
" hearing devices are an absolute necessity for children , " @entity110 said			2
" they are still developing speech and language , so they need to hear			0
older people do need them , but they have an advantage over children with hearing loss			1
they already have experience with language , and their brain can sometimes fill in the gap with words they do n't always hear			2
children do n't have that experience , and untreated hearing loss will severely hurt their development			1
" @entity185 knows that worry all too well			0
her daughter @entity187 , born in 2009 , is one of the 13,000 or so children born in the @entity189 each year with congenital hearing loss			1
it is one of the most common sensory birth defects			0
in @entity195 , where the @entity197 family lives , roughly 4 % of infants fail the newborn hearing screening , according to @entity197			1
yet none of them receive any help under the state 's public health law			0
@entity197 is trying to change that			0
she founded let @entity206 and helped persuade a state legislator to introduce a bill this year that would cover at least part of the cost			2
the legislation did n't make it through this session , but @entity197 is hopeful it will pass someday			2
@entity197 says each of her daughter 's behind - the - ear hearing aids cost $ 2,500			1
the devices require constant adjustment and will need to be replaced every few years as @entity187 grows older			0
if @entity197 lived in neighboring @entity224 , at least some of the cost of @entity187 's devices would be covered , but because she lives in @entity195 , that cost comes out of her pocket			2
" this is a major life function , especially for children , " @entity197 said			0
" i do n't want her to have any limits , and with the devices she can do anything she wants to do			0
this is an expense that would be hard for anyone , but you do what you have to do			0
" she says she worries , though , about the families that ca n't find that $ 2,500 , and wonders what happens to their children , because she 's seen how much hearing aids have transformed her daughter 's life			1
" even when she was 2 , she would point to her ears if the batteries got low , " @entity197 said			0
" she only takes them off when she wants to go to sleep			0
she wants very much to be a part of the world , and she needs them to do this -- and so do so many others			0
