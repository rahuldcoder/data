@entity0 , one of the eurozone 's economic giants , is widely expected to become the bloc 's next victim of the debt crisis			1
the eurozone 's fourth - largest economy appears headed toward a sovereign bailout , market watchers say			1
the question now is when			0
@entity0 faces regional dissent ahead of local elections , 20 billion euros ( $ 25 billion ) in debt repayments this month , violent protests on the street , savage budget cuts and devastating unemployment rates			1
analysts and economists canvassed by @entity21 say the issue is whether the country can survive the near term challenges or be forced to seek assistance within weeks			0
@entity0 has tried to stem its crisis with a tough budget and an audit on its banking needs			0
but its efforts face headwinds including pressure from the markets and contagion from frail eurozone members such as @entity36 and @entity37			0
crisis in - depth according to @entity40 , director of @entity41 : " @entity0 is not 100 % in control of its own destiny			0
" @entity45 economist @entity44 believes the upcoming vote for independence in @entity48 -- the country 's most fractious region -- could tip @entity0 into seeking a bailout			2
he expects the @entity0 government to request external help between october 21 and november 25 , when local elections will take place			1
@entity44 noted : " market pressure is likely to rise ahead of the vote for independence in @entity48 as uncertainty over @entity0 's political cohesion will surge			2
" but @entity40 believes @entity0 will be able to hold out until january , despite the regional bickering			0
he told @entity21 : " these political disputes were never really addressed before because everyone was filthy , stinking rich			0
when you 're filthy , stinking poor , everything matters			0
" @entity66 , of @entity67 , told @entity21 that @entity0 's upcoming bond payments -- of 5.3 billion euros on october 29 and 15 billion euros on october 31 -- will leave the coffers " very empty			1
" she added , " assuming the @entity70 has sufficient cash reserves to cover the october redemptions the next pressure point comes in january			0
" @entity0 : gliding toward bailout ? while it is " difficult " to rule out a need for aid this year , @entity0 's situation is likely to drag on a little longer , she added			2
@entity79 , chief @entity80 economist at @entity81 , believes the risk of a bailout is not " imminent " but that another spike in the country 's borrowing costs would likely be the catalyst for any request			2
@entity0 is already poised to tap @entity80 's bailout funds to help its banks , which require almost 60 billion euros in support , according to last week 's audit			1
@entity0 has 100 billion euros available to it after the @entity93 in july agreed to assist the country to recapitalize its banks			1
however , @entity0 has always said the bank bailout is not a sovereign bailout , unlike those given to @entity36 , @entity98 and @entity37			1
the banking audit showed seven of the 14 banks assessed -- accounting for approximately 38 % of the @entity0 banking system 's credit portfolio -- failed the stress tests			2
@entity0 's next crisis : regional splits ? at a press conference in @entity109 last week , deputy economy minister @entity107 said @entity0 may ask for 40 billion euros of @entity80 aid while the rest of the money could come from the banks themselves			1
however , @entity40 said : " if you do n't force mergers [ between banks ] 60 billion euros is n't going to be enough , its going to be closer to 100 billion euros			1
" and @entity45 credit analyst @entity118 , commenting on the stress tests last week , told @entity21 the country still faced the " heavy lifting			0
" he added , " over the coming months , restructuring plans will need to be finished - off and approved , the architecture of the bad bank finalized , and the delicate task of haircutting subordinated creditors -- many of which are retail investors -- carried out			0
