@entity0 -- the first night - flowering orchid known to science has been discovered by botanists on an island in @entity6			1
the new species , called @entity8 , is the first which has flowers which consistently open up at night and close in the morning , say botanists			2
it was found by @entity14 orchid specialist @entity13 during a field trip to the island of @entity17 , near @entity18			1
after gaining permission to collect orchids from a logging area on the island @entity13 took them back to the @entity14 for cultivation at the @entity25 in @entity26			0
the orchid starting producing buds but would wilt once they reached the size at which they would usually open			2
it was only when he took the plant home that he was able to observe the buds opening at night			2
according to @entity13 , the buds would flower at 10pm before closing again around twelve hours later			1
the flowers only last one night			0
botanists are n't sure why this species flowers after dark but suggest it might be because its pollinators are midges which forage at night			2

only a small amount of all known plant species flower at night , says @entity55 , an orchid specialist from the @entity56 at @entity57 in @entity0			1
" there must be hundreds , but only a few are relatively well known because they are cultivated , " @entity55 said			0
these include the queen of the night cactus , the midnight horror tree and the night blooming jasmine , according to @entity57			0
but until now not one of the estimated 25,000 orchid species on @entity67 was known to do the same			1
" this is another reminder that surprising discoveries can still be made			0
but it 's a race against time to find species like this that only occur in primeval forests			0
as we all know , such forests are disappearing fast , " @entity55 said .			0
