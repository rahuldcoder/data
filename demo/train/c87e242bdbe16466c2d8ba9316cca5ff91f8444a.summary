-- president @entity1 poked fun at everyone -- from his wife to @entity5 -- during the annual @entity6 , before ending his speech with a tribute to journalists who brave deadly conditions to get a story			1
no one was safe from the president 's zings on saturday night , including @entity16 presidential challengers			1
days after releasing his long - form birth certificate to refute claims he was n't born in the @entity20 , the president began his address by showing what he called his birth video			1
but rather than footage of a baby @entity26 being born in @entity27 , the clip was from @entity29 's " @entity28 , " showing the grand unveiling of the baby @entity31 in @entity32			1
the speech was before a crowd of about 2,600 at the packed @entity36 ballroom			1
in addition to journalists , other attendees included chief of staff @entity40 , defense secretary @entity41 and speaker of the house @entity42			2
actors , fashion icons and musicians also attended , helping set the event apart from a typical late - night dinner among politicos in @entity50			0
@entity51 was represented by the likes of " @entity54 " star @entity53 , " @entity57 " standout @entity56 , @entity58 of " @entity60 " fame , among others			0
@entity65 and @entity66 , frontmen for legendary rock groups @entity61 and @entity62 respectively , also mingled with the guests , as did fashion designers @entity69 and @entity70			0
@entity1 then singled out an unsmiling @entity5 and credited him with making hard decisions -- such as firing @entity72 over @entity73 on an episode of " @entity75 " -- and succeeding in his push for the president to release his long - form birth certificate			1
" now , he can focus on more important matters like , did we fake the moon landing ? what really happened in @entity83 ? and where are @entity85 and @entity86 ? " @entity1 said , referring to @entity88 's 1969 walk on the moon , the alleged @entity91 crash in @entity92 and the deaths of rappers @entity85 and @entity86			1
the president also jokingly suggested several republicans who have signalled they might challenge him in 2012 were not born in @entity20			0
he revealed that rep. @entity98 came from @entity99 , talked about the full name of @entity102 gov. @entity101 , and hinted that the first language of former @entity105 governor , @entity104 , is @entity106			0
@entity104 ended his tenure as @entity1 's appointed ambassador to @entity106 on saturday			1
" and then there 's a vicious rumor floating around that could really hurt @entity112 , " @entity1 said			2
" i hear he passed universal health care when he was governor of @entity115			0
" not even his wife , first lady @entity116 , was immune to ribbing			0
alluding to her push to promote healthy eating , the president said the two of them made a great team at the recent easter egg roll : " i 'd give candy ... to the kids , and she 'd snatch them right back out of their hands			0
" the president concluded his presentation on a serious note with a tribute to the tornado - ravaged areas in the @entity133 and to journalists who have been " threatened , arrested , beaten , attacked and in some cases even killed " on the job			0
" no one should be silenced , " @entity1 said			2
" that 's what you do			0
and at its best , that 's what journalism is			0
" the president was followed on stage by @entity146 , the head writer and " @entity149 " anchor for " @entity148			2
" @entity146 poked fun at news outlets such as @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity0 and the @entity155			1
he also focused on the 2012 @entity16 presidential field -- a roster he said " sounds like season 13 of ' @entity159 , ' and not the stars ( but ) the dancers			2
" as is tradition , the dinner 's featured speaker did n't let the commander - in - chief off unscathed			2
@entity146 said the one candidate who could " definitely beat " the incumbent was the " 2008 @entity1			1
you would have loved him			0
" the @entity6 dinner was @entity1 's third as president			1
it has been a ritual in @entity36 since 1920 , when it was first held to boost communication between the press and the president , according to the association 's website			1
it was only open to men until 1962 , when president @entity181 said he would not attend unless women were invited .			0
