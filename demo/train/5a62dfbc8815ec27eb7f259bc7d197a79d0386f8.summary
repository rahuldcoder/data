@entity0 , @entity1 -- docked at the largest naval base in @entity1 monday is a ship with a bright red hull and the weight of the world resting on the shoulders of its 30 - member crew			1
to some , the ship represents their only chance at closure after the disappearance of loved ones on @entity17			1
to others , it 's the best chance of solving one of the greatest mysteries in modern aviation			2
departing just after sunset , the @entity23 sets out to the search zone in the southern @entity26 , one of the most remote places on @entity29 , some 1,100 miles off the coast of @entity1			1
it will take three days just to get to this corner of the world , where waves are taller than many buildings , and the seas conceal mountain ranges			2
@entity2 asked to ride with the crew of the @entity39 to document their journey			2
but the mission is too long and too important to allow for the added burden of carrying journalists onboard			2
anxious wait so we sit in a chartered fishing boat named @entity47 and wait anxiously for the @entity39 to begin its journey			2
our expectation of a monday morning departure is quickly dashed			0
so we wait on the water , watching the boat and filing hourly live updates			0
the 6:30pm departure time is pushed back an hour			0
at 7:30pm , the ship still sits at the dock			1
the @entity39 finally departs just before 8pm , cloaked in darkness , only its deck lights guiding the way from @entity0 , out of @entity60 , and into the @entity26			0
we watch as the @entity39 makes its way up the narrow channel headed for the open sea , traveling so fast our 60 - foot fishing boat ca n't keep up			1
" we started out , he was running about 8 to 10 knots and started picking up speed , " says our captain , @entity65			0
" i think by the time he was doing about 15 knots we were still in the channel			0
" battery race and there 's a reason that the team aboard the @entity39 is in a hurry			0
the batteries on the underwater locator beacons , or pingers , attached to the flight data recorder and cockpit voice recorder have less than a week before they 're set to expire			1
and these crew members are the only ones equipped to find them			0
they carry the latest technology from the @entity84 , including a towed pinger locator , or @entity86 - 25 , a giant underwater microphone that will listen for the pings from the black boxes			1
then there 's the @entity91 - 21 , an underwater robot that can scour the ocean bed , looking for signs of wreckage			1
but there 's a problem			0
more than three weeks after @entity17 is believed to have gone down in the southern @entity26 , no wreckage has been sighted			1
and that means the team aboard the @entity39 does n't know where to look			0
" no matter how specialized or sophisticated this equipment is , it wo n't do any good unless that search zone can be narrowed , " says commander @entity101 of the @entity84 , in charge of the 11 - person team on board who will operate the @entity86 and @entity91 - 21			1
@entity101 says in order to have a hope of hearing the pingers , the search area needs to be reduced from more than 100,000 square miles ( 259,000 square kilometers ) to less than 1,000 ( 2,590 )			1
and the only way to do that is for search teams to find and confirm debris from the airliner , and to use computer models that can trace back currents and conditions and help pinpoint where the plane went down			1
disappointment but with each new day in the search zone , and each new discovery , comes new disappointment			2
objects sighted by search aircraft and pulled from the ocean have no link to the missing airliner			1
and while the water is like glass here in @entity60 and the waters are less than 100 feet deep , out in the search zone , it 's 14,000 feet to the bottom , with conditions that are some of most punishing on the planet			2
as the @entity39 opens up its throttle , we try to keep its striking red hull in sight , hoping to follow it on its mission for as long as we can			0
but then , a nearby vessel flashes an @entity147 signal with its spotlight			0
our captain makes the call to divert and try to help			0
" tomorrow it could be me , " @entity151 says			0
we pull alongside , where we learn another charter boat has blown its engine in the middle of a busy shipping lane			0
as we tow the boat to safety , the @entity39 disappears on the horizon , closing the gap in its search for @entity17			1
perhaps a few miles closer to finding even the smallest bit of closure for the families of the missing			1
and answers for the rest of the world .			0

an @entity1 ship has left port to try to locate " pings " from missing airliner @entity17
some see it as the best hope of finding the vanished @entity180 flight
it carries state - of - the - art equipment to detect pings from the black boxes
but man in charge of the gear says it is no use unless search area can be narrowed
