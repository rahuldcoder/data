@entity0 is the author of " @entity1 : a @entity2			1
" he is @entity3 and @entity4 at @entity5 in @entity6			0
his web site is @entity8 /			0
@entity0 says imposing more sanctions on @entity1 , with its volatile politics , would be a mistake			1
( @entity13 ) -- in a recent congressional hearing , @entity15 chairman @entity14 called the @entity17 " a sword of damocles over the @entity1 " that will soon come down if president @entity21 's diplomatic overture did not show signs of success by the fall			1
that sword is no mere metaphor and might kill more than the president 's diplomatic overture			0
the hearing came as demonstrators around the globe joined @entity1 protesting the brutal crackdown of the uprising against the beleaguered regime			1
meanwhile , a kangaroo court began the trial of the leading reformists as the contested second - term presidency of @entity39 was about to be summarily inaugurated			0
of the six invited panelists at this hearing , three -- @entity42 of the @entity43 , @entity44 of the @entity45 and @entity46 of the @entity47 -- maintained that the @entity48 should impose more severe economic sanctions on @entity1			1
@entity50 of the @entity51 and @entity52 of the @entity53 were counseling that @entity54 wait until " the dust has settled " over the current crisis before imposing such sanctions			0
@entity58 of the @entity59 , however , upped the ante and said that the @entity48 and other nations should impose multilateral " crippling sanctions " and not merely " half - baked " measures			2
although the paramount item on the agenda of the hearing was the @entity70 's nuclear program , the key question of the current post-electoral crisis was obviously on everyone 's mind			2
@entity52 informed the committee that " many members of the opposition and the population actually are starting to come around			0
their views towards sanctions have changed			0
they 're not in a position to publicly articulate that right now			0
... they 're starting to see value in it , " a view that @entity58 seconded			0
the @entity17 would allow the president to take new measures against @entity1 by imposing sanctions on the export of gasoline to the country			1
the spirit of the meeting could not have been lost on any of the participants when rep. @entity94 , @entity95 , invoked the example of @entity97 in criticizing @entity1 's use of technology to block human rights , thus advocating new and harsher sanctions , or when he added that if sanctions did not work , @entity1 " need to know what 's coming next			1
" as to what exactly was to come next , rep. @entity104 , @entity105 , told the panel , " we can do more than just sanctions , " meaning advocating covert support for @entity1 opposition forces " so that they will have the material well - being ... to take on that government themselves			1
" from there , rep. @entity115 , @entity116 , proceeded to argue that he would support @entity119 bombing of @entity1			2
@entity44 proposed that in that event , it would be better for the @entity48 to carry out any military action because " we have the right capacity , " although he described that as not a " good option			0
" from imposing " crippling sanctions " to initiating " covert operations , " all the way down to military attack by @entity119 and / or the @entity48 amounts to a familiar scenario that has a very simple and coded antecedent in modern @entity1 political culture : the @entity133 - engineered coup d'Ã©tat of 1953 , for which president @entity21 apologized during his speech at @entity136 in june 2009			1
contrary to the vision and wisdom of the president , the political machinations of the @entity54 and the flawed advice offered by this group of panelists amount to a belligerent threat against the regime			0
that will exacerbate its self - righteous warring posture and have chilling consequences for the grass - roots civil rights movement inside @entity1			1
to avoid that dangerous route , we need to make a distinction between the nuclear ambitions of the @entity70 and the growing civil rights movement in @entity1			1
so far as the nuclear issue is concerned , the only viable and legitimate way to make sure the @entity70 does not develop a nuclear weapons program remains a multilateral approach through the @entity160 and geared toward a regional disarmament			0
this approach must begin by fully recognizing the fact that pursuing a peaceful nuclear program is widely supported by the @entity1 people , even by those who regard the election as invalid			2
any unilateral approach by the @entity48 that categorically disregards this fact and overlooks the crucial question of regional nuclear disarmament is frightfully reminiscent of the lead - up to the @entity172 war and is bound to fail			0
so far as the emerging civil rights movement is concerned , there is absolutely not a shred of evidence that any major or even minor opposition leader -- from @entity178 to @entity179 to @entity180 , or any of their related political organs or legitimate representatives -- has ever uttered a word that could possibly be interpreted as calling for or endorsing any sort of economic sanction against @entity1 , let alone " crippling sanctions			1
" as in the @entity172 case , imposition of economic sanctions on @entity1 will have catastrophic humanitarian consequences , while it will even more enrich and empower such critical components of the security and military apparatus as the @entity195 and the @entity196			1
the two organizations work like a massive corporate conglomerate and have major control over the export - import components of both the official and the unofficial economy			0
it will also give them a welcome opportunity to accuse the opposition of cooperation with " the enemy " and initiate even a harsher crackdown of the opposition , and perhaps even move toward a full - fledged military coup			2
the fact of the matter is that the nascent civil rights movement in @entity1 , which can use the moral support of ordinary @entity48 , is an amorphous uprising still very much in its earliest , formative , stages			1
no one , particularly a panel that has a very thin and dubious claim on scholarship on @entity1 , can speak for it in any certain terms , especially in its having asked the @entity48 to lead the imposition of new economic sanctions on @entity1			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity0 .			2

@entity0 : congressional hearing raised prospect of sanctions *vs.* @entity1
he says @entity1 's civil rights movement is at a fragile moment
he says harsh measures could give regime excuse for further crackdown
