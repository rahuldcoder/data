-- @entity1 was a young @entity2 with @entity3 looks			1
@entity4 emigrated from the @entity5 as a child and became an @entity8 citizen			1
the two met in @entity10 , fell in love and got married in @entity12 , @entity13 -- long before any state legalized same - sex marriage			1
county clerk @entity16 issued the gay couple a marriage license at 11 a.m. , april 21 , 1975			1
nothing in the @entity13 marriage code mentioned same - sex marriage , and @entity16 signed licenses for six couples before the district attorney advised her to end to them			1
but the licenses were never rescinded			0
@entity1 and @entity4 believed their marriage was legal and embarked on a decades - long struggle to attain permanent resident status for @entity1			1
they became the first gay couple to sue the federal government for recognition of their marriage , effectively launching a movement that helped lead to the @entity36 's ruling a year ago that struck down the @entity37 , which defined marriage as between a man and a woman			1
but even now , a year after that historic ruling , @entity1 , 72 , remains in @entity8 , undocumented			1
in april , he filed a motion for the government to reopen his case and grant him a green card			0
federal immigration law says a @entity8 citizen or green card holder can sponsor a spouse so that they can remain together in @entity8			1
but because of @entity37 , the law did not afford that right to binational gay couples			1
after @entity37 's demise , about 40,000 such couples became eligible for immigration rights			1
previously , they were forced to choose between love and country -- and many of them lived in exile to be together			1
" the @entity37 ruling completely changed the landscape , " said @entity62 , an attorney with @entity63 , an organization that has been working with same - sex binational couples for two decades			1
it was a watershed moment , and within one week of the ruling , @entity63 heard from 1,500 couples seeking help			0
that 's more than the total number of inquiries the group got the year before , @entity62 said			2
" it was as if a light switch had gone off , " he said			0
" @entity78 couples go through the same process now as straight couples			0
" a year after @entity37 , these couples choose both love and country however , some people , like @entity1 , have been left behind , said his attorney , @entity85 , a gay rights lawyer who helped found @entity63			1
six months before the @entity37 ruling , @entity1 's spouse died			1
@entity85 said gay and lesbian widows and widowers are fighting to get their marriages recognized even though they no longer have a spouse who can sponsor them for a visa			1
@entity1 hopes that the @entity93 will allow him to live in the @entity8 , as he has done for the past 40 years , legally			1
" common sense says that my petition should be accepted			0
decency also says it should be accepted , " @entity1 said			1
" at the moment , i am just living my life day to day			0
" a license and a letter at 29 , @entity1 left home in @entity102 , @entity2 , and was in the middle of an around - the - world trip when he stumbled upon @entity4 at a gay bar called @entity106 in @entity10			1
it was @entity108 , 1971			0
the two agreed to meet for a date the next day at @entity112 's star on @entity113			0
soon after , they knew they wanted to spend the rest of their lives together			0
but @entity1 was on a tourist visa in the @entity8			1
he was not permitted to work			0
he would have to leave the country when his visa expired			1
they began to think about ways they could stay together			0
there was no country in the world then that allowed immigration rights for same - sex partners , nowhere they could go			1
@entity1 remained in the country -- illegally			1
then , on television one day , they heard the most incredible news : a @entity13 clerk had issued a marriage license to two men			2
@entity1 and @entity4 immediately made plans to fly to @entity12			1
@entity16 , the @entity138 clerk , was 31 , wore her skirts short and her hair long			0
she 'd joined the @entity141 and was swept up in the movement for equal rights			0
she surprised even herself by winning the clerk 's race			0
she 'd been on the job only three months when a couple from @entity147 -- @entity148 and @entity149 -- showed up wanting to get married			2
after she learned from the district attorney that nothing in the marriage code referred to gay marriages as illegal , @entity16 granted the two men their wish			2
she did not know any gay people ; she 'd grown up in the small town of @entity157 , @entity13 , before it became a skiing haven			0
her world was pretty insular			2
but she felt in her gut it was the right thing to do			0
@entity1 and @entity4 showed up in @entity12 , got a license and then were married in a church that supported gay rights			1
the first thing @entity4 did when they returned to @entity10 was to petition what was then the @entity169 ( @entity169 ) for permanent residency or a green card for @entity1			1
they could finally envision a future together in the @entity8			1
but suddenly , after their marriage made headlines , their private lives had become very public			2
newspapers ran stories about them			0
@entity180 invited them on his daytime tv talk show			0
soon , they began to feel the sting of homophobia			0
@entity1 's mother wrote him a letter disowning him			1
" perversion is bad enough , " she wrote , " but public display , never			0
... i can endure no more			0
" a woman in the audience of " @entity180 " told @entity1 : " i think we should give you a lottery ticket and send you back to where you came from			2
" worst of all was a letter from the @entity197 that arrived in the mail in november 1975			0
it contained only one sentence explaining a denial of a green card : " you have failed to establish that a bona fide marital relationship can exist between two faggots			0
" the @entity169 followed up with a second letter that said the green card petition was denied on the grounds that neither party was able to perform female functions in a marriage			0
it was inconceivable to @entity1 and @entity4 that anyone in government would use such language , especially that other " f " word			1
they filed the first lawsuit in @entity8 that sought recognition from the federal government for a same - sex marriage			1
but after years of legal wrangling , the 9th @entity222 ruled against the couple in 1985			0
the opinion , written by future @entity36 @entity226 , affirmed that marriage was between a man and a woman			0
@entity1 and @entity4 had lost			1
they tried to appeal to the @entity36 but the justices refused to hear their case			0
@entity1 had exhausted every avenue available to him			2
he had a limited number of days left to voluntarily leave @entity8 before authorities would deport him to @entity2			1
if he and @entity4 wanted to remain together , they had no choice but to leave the country			1
they felt like refugees because of their sexual orientation			0
there still was n't any nation that recognized same - sex marriages , so @entity1 and @entity4 headed for @entity245 , where they had friends			1
they boarded @entity249 for @entity250 , leaving everything behind			0
for @entity4 , it was especially painful to separate from his mother and sisters			2
the couple floated around @entity245 like paupers for 11 months and eventually got fed up and returned to the @entity8 by way of @entity258			2
back then , crossing the border was easier , and @entity1 got through by passing as an @entity8			1
@entity1 resumed life in @entity10 under the radar of immigration authorities			1
in a way , it was a relief to live in hiding , away from the spotlight			0
in other ways it was painful			0
@entity1 's mother and brother died			2
without documents , he could not travel and attend their funerals in @entity2			2
the couple also had returned to an @entity8 reeling from the @entity274 epidemic			2
they watched their friends get sick and die			0
they lived quietly , all the time fearing that @entity1 could , at any moment , get picked up by immigration agents			1
bittersweet victory in 2010 , @entity4 was diagnosed with lung cancer			2
by then the gay rights movement had gained momentum and it seemed as though states were falling like dominoes on the question of same - sex marriage			1
@entity85 , the couple 's lawyer , knew there was a chance the @entity36 would strike down @entity37			2
that 's what he told @entity1 and @entity4 when he visited them on december 15 and encouraged them to go to @entity295 and get married there -- just in case the government refused to recognize their @entity13 license			1
they decided to marry again , except they would see it as an affirmation ceremony			0
instead of " death do us part , " they planned to say , " as long as there is love			0
" they never made it to @entity295			0
@entity4 died the next day			2
several newspapers ran his obituary			0
he and @entity1 were , after all , pioneers in the struggle for gay rights in @entity8			1
when @entity37 was struck down a year ago on june 26 , @entity1 watched the news with his dog @entity317			1
he thought it ironic that @entity226 was the swing vote			0
in @entity1 's eyes , the justice had redeemed himself for the decision he 'd handed down all those years ago			2
the ruling was a victory for gay couples but bittersweet for @entity1			2
he wished @entity4 were there by his side to witness history			2
" it was a grave injustice he did n't live to see that day , " @entity1 said			2
when @entity4 died , @entity1 's first inclination was to walk away from it all , to return to @entity2			1
but he realized that @entity8 was home now			2
that 's why he has asked immigration authorities to reconsider his petition for permanent residency			0
" i should be allowed to continue my life here , " he said , " even though it 's in a state of widowerhood			0
" recently , he attended the premier of a new documentary , " @entity347 , " which chronicles his relationship with @entity4 and his battle to gain permanent residency			1
it will be shown in @entity349 on the first anniversary of the @entity37 ruling			2
it was tough for @entity1 to sit through the film and see himself on the big screen			2
but he has no regrets			0
the @entity8 government may not have recognized his marriage as legitimate , but for 41 years , he was a participant in a love story			1
it was the kind of love that many never experience			0
a love like @entity364 's			0
" they never managed to separate us , " he said			0
follow @entity0 's @entity368 on @entity369			0

@entity2 @entity371 married @entity4 , a @entity8 citizen , in 1975
no country in the world recognized same - sex marriage then
@entity1 *overstayed* his tourist visa and lived under the radar in order to be with his love
one year after @entity37 was struck down , @entity1 is trying again for permanent residence
