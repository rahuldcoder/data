-- @entity1 has been certified polio - free by the @entity3 after going three years without an endemic case of polio			1
the eradication of polio in @entity1 is heralded as one of the biggest achievements in global health efforts			1
the polio - free certification by the @entity13 came thursday , along with a proclamation that @entity15 is free of the disease			1
just five years ago , @entity1 was home to nearly half the global polio cases and considered one of the most technically difficult places to eradicate the disease , because of sanitation challenges and high - density population			1
@entity1 's last case was reported in a young girl paralyzed by polio in @entity27 in january 2011			1
meet the last person to have polio in @entity1 so how did the second most populous country in the world , considered the hardest place to end polio , become free of the disease ? health workers determined that the children of migrants or those growing up in difficult - to - reach areas were not getting access to vaccines			1
so they deployed immunization efforts to reach the most vulnerable , according to @entity43			2
@entity1 launched a massive effort involving a surveillance network and almost 2.3 million vaccine administrators , who identified communities falling through the cracks			2
to counter rumors and misgivings about the vaccine , social mobilizers , religious leaders and parents were included to increase understanding about immunizations			0
they also bolstered communication and outreach efforts that often included @entity62 celebrities and cricket players			0
the efforts combined government , various @entity67 agencies as well as philanthropic organizations			0
the highly infectious viral disease primarily affects young children and could lead to paralysis and death			0
it can be prevented through immunization , but there is no cure			0
the incidence of the disease has dropped by more than 99 % since 1988			0
it remains endemic in three countries -- @entity81 , @entity82 and @entity83 -- down from more than 125 countries in 1988			0
vaccinating children against polio can be a deadly job polio workers in those countries have been facing violence as some militant groups have begun targeting anti-polio campaigns			2
in december , the @entity3 began vaccination efforts to reach more than 23 million children across the @entity95 following an outbreak of the disease in @entity98 .			2
