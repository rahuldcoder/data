-- golfers dream of winning their first major title -- it brings not only money , fame and a place in the history books , but also the confidence that more success will follow			2
@entity10 , however , might disagree			1
back in 2001 , the @entity11 was celebrating his first major championship , delivering an unexpectedly emotional speech at @entity14 after his breakthrough win at the @entity16			1
however , he 's still waiting for his next top - level victory , having fallen from the summit of the world rankings to 750th this season after making the halfway cut in just two of 12 starts on the @entity23			1
his last win of any kind was on his 30th birthday at a @entity28 event in november 2001			2
it 's grim reading for a man who once shot the holy grail of 59 , who has won 13 times on the @entity11 circuit and is 40th in the @entity23 's all - time standings with tournament earnings of almost $ 19 million			1
" well , a lot of it really comes from injury , when you 're fighting a nagging back injury , " he told @entity0 's @entity42 show ahead of this week 's return to the @entity45 course where he entered his name alongside those of golfing greats			1
" it 's still a problem			0
it 's been 12 years now , started before that year , started in 2000 , i 've had tendonitis in my shoulders , my wrists , had some knee problems			2
" as a professional golfer you get used to playing with some aches and pains , but when you 're playing with aches and pains that impede what you 're trying to do it becomes that much more difficult and it can wreck form			0
" and my form was wrecked -- you start hitting the ball crooked and your confidence gets wrecked			0
" against all odds despite his long wait for another victory , @entity10 still holds out hope that he can again lift a trophy			1
he will make history if he does succeed at @entity14 -- the longest gap between @entity16 victories is 11 years , when @entity80 won his second title in 1937 and third in 48			1
for those not affected by @entity85 , when no tournaments were played , the mark is nine years -- most recently achieved by @entity87 ( 1959 - 1968 )			2
" i still have it in me			0
it has n't always lined up as often as it did 10 years ago , but that comes when you lose a bit of confidence -- you get hurt , and it 's hard to stay on that path , " @entity10 said			2
" i 've put in the time , i 've put in the effort			0
i still have the desire , so i think it could be another great week for me			0
" turning back time @entity10 rolled back the years when he tied for second at the @entity103 , but he has not made the cut at the @entity106 major since tying for 39th the previous year			1
" i 've been working very hard and i feel good about what i 've been doing and i feel good about my chances at @entity14 this year , " the 40 - year - old said			1
" i 'm really looking forward to getting there and playing , and there 's no reason i ca n't start over where i got started			0
" @entity10 won by three shots in 2001 , and stunned the gallery when he took off his trademark sunglasses and cap to make a heartfelt victory speech			1
" it just came to me			0
i 'd been playing ( the @entity16 ) since ' 95 , and this year will be my 16th			1
my first experience over there at the @entity121 at @entity122 before the ' @entity123 at @entity124 was a real eye - opener for me , " he recalled			2
" the galleries seemed to be that much more knowledgeable about the game , about the difficulty of shots you were facing , and i just kind of took it all in			0
" just because i wore a hat down low with sunglasses does n't mean i ca n't be a nice person , you know i do it for a reason , and i just took them off , had an opportunity to and talked -- and it really did hit me just some of the experiences i 'd had over the years there			0
" future 's so bright , got ta wear shades no matter the gloomy @entity106 weather , expect to see @entity10 back in shades and hat for the july 19 - 22 tournament in @entity149			1
" for some reason my eyes seem very sensitive to the light , and i always felt that it 's easier to play golf like this than with your eyes squinting , to have them open all the way , " he said			2
" i wear contacts when i play			0
in college i kept getting a lot of dust and pollen in my eyes -- it was an issue and i was the only one to wear contacts -- and that was the impetus to put on a pair of sunglasses			0
" @entity10 expects @entity170 's bunker - filled fairways to again pose a major test for the world 's top golfers			1
" i do n't think it has kind of the reputation or fame of some of the other venues they have -- i 'm not quite sure why , " he said			0
" the year i won i shot 10 under par and won by three strokes , and we had pretty nice weather , and i think that goes to the strength , the difficulty and the challenge of the golf course			1
you really do have to place the golf ball around			0
" you have to go around the golf course like that , knowing what you 're trying to do , knowing why you 're trying to do that , and stick to it			0

former world *no.* 1 @entity10 will return to the scene of his only major triumph
@entity11 won the 2001 @entity16 at @entity14 in @entity45
it was his last victory on one of the major golf circuits before a *career* *slump*
the 40 - year - old has been *battling* injury problems ever since that win
