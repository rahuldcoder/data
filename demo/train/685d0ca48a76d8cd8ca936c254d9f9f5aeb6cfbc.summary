-- airline passengers are already able to check in to flights , download boarding passes , select a seat on the go and keep an eye on the upgrades list thanks to recent evolutions in smartphone technology , and the options just keep growing			0
a global industrywide airline @entity11 shows that more than 90 % of the airlines surveyed are increasing their investment in mobile capabilities to ease the hassles of getting through the airport and improve the in - flight experience			1
and the airlines are likely to find a way to generate revenue , too			0
so what 's a flier to expect from airline apps on the horizon ? in the not - too - distant future , you 'll probably be able to rent a car , pay bag fees and use augmented reality to find the nearest airport bar through your airline 's smartphone app. @entity33 is putting emphasis on improving mobile functionality			1
while some airline apps allow travelers to make flight reservations ( a feature that @entity33 has not introduced but promises is coming ) , the world 's largest carrier is one of the few airlines that gives customers the ability to adjust travel itineraries from their mobile device			1
delayed @entity33 passengers who miss a connection now can immediately rebook a different flight and download a new boarding pass , all while in the air			2
the airline has some new app plans up its sleeve as well			2
@entity33 declines to give a release date for the feature , but it is close to unveiling a new tool where travelers can track checked baggage from their mobile devices , according to @entity33 spokesman @entity64			1
( they can already do so on the airline 's website			0
) the airline eventually could offer other services on its mobile app that are already listed on its website , such as the ability to search for hotel and car rental reservations , @entity64 said			1
@entity75 , a company that creates onboard merchandising technology , is already trying to integrate these services into an airline app with the launch of its @entity80 platform , which it pitched to major airlines this week , a company official said			1
the mobile app does not just offer access to itinerary details , but it also functions as a one - stop shop for airline passengers to make in - air purchases related to their trip , such as in - flight refreshments and arrangements for ground transportation , dining and entertainment in the destination city			2
@entity75 says it is in talks with most major @entity97 carriers about implementing the @entity80 , which would likely be offered by airlines as a separate app from the ticketing - based ones that exist			2
" we are providing airlines with the opportunity to offer their passengers a streamlined experience , " said @entity101 , @entity75 's executive vice president of new markets and products			2
" disparity within the mobile channel is a huge issue despite the fact that consumers are increasingly expecting cross-platform integration and a consistent experience			0
the fully integrated mobile platform that we have built allows travelers to check in to flights and hotels , view travel information and updates , and receive offers from multiple airline carriers , hotels and other services -- all at one time , and in one place			1
" the hope is the @entity80 will also allow airlines to generate new revenue streams by capitalizing for the first time on destination - related purchases			0
but integrating outside products and services into airline apps is not the only way that airlines hope to customize the passenger experience while increasing revenue			1
according to @entity33 's @entity64 , the demand is likely there for airlines eventually to offer add - ons such as standby upgrades and the ability to pay for extra checked baggage through mobile applications , but industry research suggests that offering those types of mobile transactions wo n't happen overnight			1
according to a report released this year by @entity152 , a company that develops technology for the travel industry , ancillary services -- from premium seating to in - flight meals -- are unlikely to be sold on airlines ' mobile platforms on a widespread level for another year or two			1
so more add - ons and products will be available , but is help on the way for slogging through the airport ? @entity97 , @entity166 and @entity167 airlines currently offer airport maps in their mobile apps , with @entity33 soon to join them			1
but the maps are generally useful only in locating gates ; they do n't offer detailed information on where to find food and shopping locations			0
augmented reality technology may come to the rescue here			0
it allows users to point the camera on their smartphone at their surroundings and receive corresponding information about their current location , such as which restaurants and stores are nearby			0
@entity152 's report estimates it will take three to five years for most airlines to find a way to integrate augmented reality into an airline app. airlines might take some cues from a new app released by @entity197 's @entity196 this year , which became the world 's first application to use augmented reality indoors successfully -- according to @entity200 , the app 's developer			1
the app allows travelers at the airport to access not just gate information but also details on surrounding shops and services , saving them time while trying to catch a flight			2
even when it comes to selling fares through mobile clients , a service that 85 % of airlines in the @entity218 either offer or plan to offer by 2014 , there is room for improvement			0
currently , airline apps only offer tickets with their specific carrier , and mobile customers ca n't take advantage of the flexibility offered by airline alliances			0
" airline alliances , the @entity232 in particular , have n't really kept pace with mobile developments , " said @entity228 , the @entity97 editor of the travel tech site @entity230			0
" granted , creating a mobile app that brings in dozens of airlines would be no easy task , but there should be some kind of booking capability at this juncture			2
" the @entity232 has two mobile apps available for download : one that offers airport information in addition to the ability to search and track flights , and another that is a fare finder for flights on the alliance 's airlines			1
the @entity232 includes airlines such as @entity166 , @entity167 , @entity255 and @entity256 -- which does not currently offer a mobile app. but those airlines that fail to take the full leap into the mobile world will quickly find themselves in the minority			0
apps might not replace websites as the primary place where people purchase airline reservations , especially with new airline initiatives to integrate ticket - purchasing apps into social - media sites such as @entity271			0
however , they 're beginning to offer a level of customer service and convenience that has never before been possible in the industry , and perhaps could even transform the experience of traveling enough to create a new barometer on which airline brands will be judged in the future .			0

airlines are increasing their investment in mobile capabilities
ancillary services are likely to be incorporated into the mobile menu
