@entity0 -- a huge trove of artwork from the world 's premier collection of @entity7 contemporary art has been donated to a new visual culture museum in @entity0			1
the donation features 1,463 pieces of artwork by 310 artists , including many critically - acclaimed names such as @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , and @entity19 , according to museum authorities			1
valued at a total of hk $ 1.3 billion ( us $ 167.5 million ) by auction house @entity22 , the works stem from a celebrated private collection amassed over the past three decades by @entity25 , a former @entity26 ambassador to @entity7 and a renowned art collector			1
@entity25 's collection is internationally acclaimed not only for being the world 's largest trove of @entity7 contemporary art , but also for its comprehensiveness and historical importance in documenting the development of contemporary art in @entity7			1
" the period 1979 - 2009 in @entity7 is a unique moment in art history			2
given both the fact that many works , especially from the first ten years of this period were destroyed due to lack of interest from collectors and institutions , and the subsequent boom in the market for these works , it would be impossible to now build a collection similar in depth , scope and quality , " @entity37 , the m + museum 's executive director , said in a statement			0
" by joining forces with m + , the art works will ultimately come full circle back to @entity7 as i have always hoped they would , " @entity25 added			0
he said his donation is intended to " enable these artists to have a space within m + where they will communicate with an international audience , and where they will meet with a @entity7 public			2
" the donation , which will form part of m + 's permanent collection , provides a tremendous boost to the yet - as - unbuilt museum , which is intended to be the flagship facility in an ambitious government - led project to create a contemporary arts complex called the @entity74			2
the high - profile project has experienced repeated delays , scrapped plans , high staff turnover , and many rounds of public consultations since its announcement in 1998			0
@entity25 's contribution is the " most important development to date for the @entity74 project , " said @entity86 , co-founder and executive director of @entity88			0
" it 's extremely significant in the sense that it 's an encyclopedic collection â€” he went about collecting it as if he was an institution as opposed to [ assembling ] a personal collection			0
" in a talk at the @entity95 in november , @entity37 said he was discussing with major @entity97 art collectors the possibility of donations , given the museum had hk $ 1.7 billion in seed funding -- an amount that would not go far in purchasing top - notch @entity7 contemporary art , which has shot up in price in recent years			1
a @entity16 painting set an auction record of hk $ 79 million ( us $ 10 million ) for @entity7 contemporary art in april 2011			1
" it will be wonderful to have such an important collection in a public institution which can properly commit to its display and conservation for generations well beyond ours , " said @entity108 , a @entity109 - based contemporary arts philanthropist and founder of @entity111			0
@entity108 called @entity25 's donation " transformational for the museum and for our community			0
" @entity123 + has also acquired 47 works from @entity25 's collection for hk $ 177 million ( us $ 22.8 million ) under a split gift - purchase agreement			1
the museum is slated to open in 2017 .			0
