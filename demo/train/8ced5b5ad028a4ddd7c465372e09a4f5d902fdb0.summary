but @entity3 , host of the @entity5 's " @entity4 , " author of " @entity7 " and former cast member of " @entity9 , " insists that it can be done			1
" paint is very affordable			2
pick a color that has life and personality , " @entity3 says			1

' work as much with what you have as possible , and then fill in where necessary , " @entity3 said			1
@entity0 recently asked the design guru about decorating on a budget and helpful tips to make your home look its best			1
@entity0 : when you walk into a room that you 're going to redesign , where does your mind first go ? @entity3 : i look at the layout , i look at the way the space is being used , and i try to figure out what the best use of the space is ; that it works really well , it looks good , that you 're getting the best views , you 're seeing the space , and that you 're getting through the space			1
@entity0 : and that 's focusing mainly on furniture ? @entity3 : that really focuses on all the furniture			1
you want to look at where the rug is and where the sofa is and coffee tables and chairs -- just how the room works			2
even if it 's great - looking stuff , it sometimes does n't look as good as it can look			2
@entity0 : what can people on a tight budget do to rearrange their living room and make it look better with what they have ? @entity3 : make sure that your furniture layout works			1
make sure that the things you love to look at , you 're seeing			1
make sure things are n't cluttered			1
pick a color that has life and personality			2
you could do an accent wall behind your sofa			0
you could use a low - [ volatile organic compound ] paint so it 's environmentally friendly			0
you can use inexpensive up lights			0
you put them on either side of a piece of furniture or behind a tree			0
you always want to have a @entity82 dimmer you plug into the wall			0
and then plug your lamps into the @entity85 dimmer , and you can dim the whole room			0
@entity0 : as far as accessories go , like flowers and pillows , where do you draw the line on too much or not enough ? @entity3 : i like to keep things clean and straightforward			1
i think one floral arrangement is usually enough , or maybe a couple really small cute little ones			0
you want to sit on a sofa and be comfortable			0
start with three : one lumbar in the center and maybe a pair of pillows left and right			0
add a throw , a rug for underfoot			0
those things start to add layers to the room and make it a little more acoustical			2
@entity0 : what are some common designing rules that people always tend to follow but that you can actually break ? @entity3 : people think that dark walls make a room smaller			1
it actually makes the space bigger			0
all the corners recede , and it adds a lot of depth			0
also , i think that color definitely adds a lot of warmth to spaces			0
@entity0 : what 's the most common mistake that people make ? @entity3 : people just do n't trust their instincts , and they 're not willing to take a risk			1
people tend to go with beige and white just because they 're afraid or they do n't want to make a commitment			1
@entity0 : if someone had just enough money to do one thing in their room , what would you tell them to focus on ? @entity3 : the first thing you want to really focus on is a great sofa , because it is really the anchor for the room			1
in a bedroom , the anchor piece is your bed			0
start with your anchor piece , and that 's where you spend your most money			0
@entity0 : you have a new book out now , is that right ? @entity3 : yup , i have a book out right now , which is called " @entity7 , " and it 's a great book			2
it 's a lot of fun			0
it 's got a lot of great tips in it			2
it talks about my philosophy ; it talks about color and texture			0
it 's a very comprehensive book with case studies			0
@entity0 : can you give us some tips for making a place eco-friendly on a tight budget ? @entity3 : it 's very easy to use eco-friendly cleaning supplies , environmentally friendly lighting throughout your house using low wattage or eco-friendly bulbs			1
also , just turning your lights off when you 're not in a room ; when you 're brushing your teeth not keeping the water running ; taking shorter showers			2
these are all really simple , easy ways that we can all help @entity194 repair and heal and replenish itself .			1
