-- if you 've been reading the comments on @entity0 stories , you 've probably noticed that things look a little bit different			1
we 've updated our comment system to include some new features that will improve the discussion and hopefully build a greater sense of community on the site			1
a lot of the changes are designed to make it easier for you to keep up with the conversations you 're interested in			1
you 'll get real - time notifications when someone mentions you or replies to one of your comments , so you can respond right away			2
you can also find the most active discussions and see what our top commenters are saying			2
it 's also easier to share comments on @entity26 , @entity27 and other social networks so you can see what your friends and followers have to say about a story			1
the other big change is that we 've removed the " like " button and replaced it with up - and - down arrows so you can " downvote " the comments that do n't add to the discussion as well as " upvote " those you think are interesting			2
you can still flag comments that violate our community guidelines , and moderators will take appropriate action			0
one thing that wo n't change is that @entity0 will be listening to what you want to tell us , whether it 's in the comments , on social media or on @entity50			1
everyone has a unique perspective on how the news affects their lives , and we want to make sure we include as many voices as possible in our news coverage			1
we 've found that we have users who are experts on almost every imaginable topic -- from nuclear physics to grammar to where to get the best sandwich in @entity64 on a tuesday night			0
we get a lot of great ideas from the comments , and our producers are always experimenting with new ways to share your stories with the world			2
you can see some of our latest examples on our comments @entity74			0
if you have questions , suggestions or complaints , let us know in the comments below			0
we will be checking in throughout the day to respond			0
if you have a concern that you do n't want to raise publicly , feel free to e-mail me at @entity82 , and i 'll respond as soon as possible			0
thank you for being a part of the conversation .			0
