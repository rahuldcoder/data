-- born a man , @entity2 became a woman through surgery and then trained to fight in mixed martial arts			1
now that she has won her first two @entity7 bouts -- both in the first round -- she has gone public as a transgender fighter , the first on record in a popular sport that some consider as the successor to boxing			2
" the reaction has been positive , " said @entity2 , 37 , who revealed her story recently to @entity17 after a journalist with another publication began to investigate her private surgery			1
" it 's just some people , some of society does n't get it yet			2
and this is what we 're trying to do now is to inform people and let them know about transgender athletes			2
" when asked if it 's fair for a man - turned - woman fighter to face another woman in the ring , @entity2 said saturday there were " no unfair competitive advantages			1
" what was unfair , her last opponent and her manager say , is how @entity42 did n't disclose until after the fight that @entity42 had a sex change operation			1
that opponent , @entity45 , was knocked out this month with " a tie clinch , " or a knee to the chin , 39 seconds into the fight without anyone knowing of @entity2 's background			1
it was " unfair i did n't know it , but it did n't matter that she fought me , " @entity45 told @entity0			0
" i feel that it should have been disclosed to me ahead of time ... so we are aware and able to be better prepared for the situation			0
" she and her manager are going to appeal the loss in @entity59 on the grounds of how @entity42 failed to disclose being a transgender person and how the referee stopped the fight too early			1
" they should have let the fight go , " manager @entity64 said			0
" she should have thrown at least one to two more shots to confirm it			0
on that particular basis , that 's one of the things we 'll appeal with , as well as not having it disclosed			0
" meanwhile , the @entity74 is reviewing a claim by @entity42 that the state gave her a fighting license in 2013 when in fact the commission says her license application is still being reviewed , @entity17 reported			1
transgender fighter looking to get licensed @entity2 subsequently told @entity59 authorities that she had a @entity87 license , and now the @entity59 boxing commission is also reviewing @entity42 's license application , the magazine reported			1
also , @entity2 admitted she did n't disclose to boxing authorities she is a transgender person but added she was n't asked to either , the magazine said			1
@entity17 writer @entity92 wrote of @entity42 's 2006 gender reassignment surgery and winning her pro debut in may 2012			1
@entity92 told @entity0 that guidelines for the @entity96 are similar to the @entity98 's policy that allows transsexuals to compete in olympic games			0
the @entity98 requires transgender athletes to undergo hormone therapy long enough to remove gender - related advantages			0
in fact , @entity92 said , mixed martial arts guidelines do n't require a sex - change surgery , but they do require two years of hormone therapy for transgender fighters			2
" whether it comes after the surgery or it 's just on its own , that must be done and you must be tested throughout the two years , " @entity92 said			2
" those papers must be submitted to the athletic commission for review			0
" @entity45 wants to fight @entity42 again , @entity64 said			2
" we would love a rematch , " @entity64 said			0
