just an all - around great guy			2

" they had instructions not to go to the school			1
you could see the tension on their faces as they waited			0

" @entity121 will be closed " over the next several days , " district superintendent @entity146 said			0
the district 's middle school and elementary schools will be open thursday , and counseling will be available for the whole district , he said			1
@entity2 said she was running late getting her 13 - year - old daughter to the middle school wednesday morning			1

" she did n't believe it , " @entity2 said of her daughter			0
" she wanted to get down there as soon as possible			0
once we got there , not knowing if her friends were ok , she started getting emotional			0
" three of @entity2 's four children attended @entity121 , she said			0
one of her daughters graduated last year and is now a freshman at @entity170			0
