-- the heat was off @entity2 as he joined fellow grand slam winners @entity3 and @entity5 in the final 16 at the @entity6			1
@entity2 zipped through a 6 - 2 6 - 2 6 - 3 win over unseeded @entity9 @entity8 as the searing temperatures eased in @entity11 and distinctly grayer skies loomed over the show courts			1
the 32 - year - old is chasing a fifth title in @entity16 and an 18th career grand slam but for now @entity2 is grateful for small mercies after a niggling back injury saw him lose form in 2013			2
" i 'm just happy waking up in the morning and not feeling like an old man , " he told reporters			0
" so that 's very positive			0
right now i feel very fresh and very good physically			0
" my first goal was to get through the first week , now clearly the draw is very difficult			0
i 've done the work , i 've not lost a set so far , so we 'll see how it goes			0
" it 's a @entity31 test for @entity2 next as he faces @entity32 , the 10th seed , for a place in the quarterfinals			1
if he advances to the final eight , @entity2 would face @entity5 -- the man who beat him in an absorbing @entity16 semifinal last season			2
@entity5 , the @entity38 champion , battled through a first set tiebreak to see off @entity41 's @entity40 for his place in the last 16 , where he faces unseeded @entity31 @entity44			1
confident was the word @entity3 ominously used to describe how he was feeling after he breezed through with a 6 - 1 6 - 2 6 - 3 win over @entity48			1
" well today i think i have to say that i played well from everywhere , no ? " the @entity51 world @entity49 teased reporters after his match in @entity11			2
in the women 's draw , defending champion @entity54 lost just one game as she whizzed into the fourth round in @entity11			1
there she will face @entity61 @entity60 in a rematch of last year 's semifinal when @entity54 caused a stir by taking a medical timeout just as @entity60 appeared to have the upper hand in the second set			1
" we left it all here last year , " said @entity54 , when asked if she had spoken to @entity60 about the incident			2
" that 's what is important for me , to play another match			0
i 'm looking forward to it			0
" @entity9 third seed @entity75 hit her way through a tight second set to see off @entity31 's @entity78 6 - 1 7 - 6 while fifth seed @entity79 and @entity81 also advanced			1
but there was disappointment for @entity86 10th seed @entity84 as she lost 6 - 4 5 - 7 3 - 6 to unseeded @entity51 @entity87			2
@entity84 , who is engaged to golfer @entity88 , said she now intends to zone out from the @entity6 -- although she said it politely of course			0
" when i 'm not in the tournament anymore , it sounds rude , but i do n't really look at the games anymore , " she explained .			0
