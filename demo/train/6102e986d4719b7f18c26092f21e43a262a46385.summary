-- most of the great land expeditions in the world have already been conquered			0
but @entity6 explorers @entity4 and @entity7 are about to set off on one of the last			1
the two - man team is heading to @entity10 to attempt to walk the 2,987 kilometer ( 1,800 mile ) journey to the @entity12 and back			1
if they succeed , it will be the longest unsupported polar journey in history			1
they will be re-tracing the steps of captain @entity18 who had hoped to be become the first man to reach the @entity12			2
it was only when the ill - fated @entity6 explorer arrived at the @entity12 in january 1912 that he found someone else had beaten him to it			2
his rival @entity26 explorer @entity27 had claimed the honor 33 days earlier			0

@entity18 himself gives some insight to his feelings in the journal found with his body when it was discovered in november 2012 just 17.7km ( 11 miles ) from a supply depot that could have saved his life			0
" great @entity44 ! this is an awful place , " he wrote			0
it has been more than a century since @entity18 died on that return journey and while many have since visited the @entity12 , no one has ever even attempted to walk the entire round trip without a support team			1
" it just seemed to be hanging out there as a journey that ought to be finished , " says @entity4 , who will attempt the feat. there will be no dogs , no support team			1
just two men with 200kg sleighs walking across what @entity18 described as a " slough of despond			1
" a century on , @entity4 and @entity7 will still face the same brutal @entity10 conditions as @entity18			2
they will have to negotiate ever - changing glaciers riddled with crevasses where temperatures plunge as low as -50 degrees @entity70 ( -58 degrees @entity71 )			0
but what they will have is state - of - the - art equipment and technology			0
" we have clothing , equipment , food and technology that @entity18 could never have dreamed of , " says @entity4			2
" it actually has more in common with space flight than guys dragging wooden sleighs around			0
" the ability to communicate could not only be potentially life - saving , but will also allow @entity4 to upload blogs , video and photographs to the @entity90 website throughout what he hopes will be a ground - breaking four - month journey .			0
