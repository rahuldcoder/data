-- president @entity1 and @entity3 prime minister @entity2 met monday as more than 10,000 pro-israel activists gathered in @entity5 for the annual @entity6			0
but rather than focusing on the stalled @entity10 peace process , their talks and subsequent media coverage have centered on the question of using military force to stop @entity14 's nuclear program			1
the events in @entity5 took place just after 24 @entity17 , @entity19 and @entity20 prominent faith leaders from the @entity21 and @entity22 returned from a mission to the @entity10			1
the joint delegation returned from the birthplace of the three great faiths of the western world convinced that religion can be a force for unity and understanding instead of a source of division and conflict			1
unfortunately , however , concerns about security and safety have made the @entity39 a region of walls that have all but eliminated any contact between @entity3 and @entity42 today			0
in the six days the delegation visited the region , they got a sense of the fear that has led to the building of many kinds of walls			1
they saw much evidence of the distrust , intolerance and hatred that exists between the two sides of the conflict			0
but they also met faith leaders and civic activists of great vision and courage			0
rabbi @entity63 , the founder of @entity64 and a former member of the @entity3 cabinet , is working with dr. @entity67 , the secretary general of the @entity68 in @entity69 , to moderate the views of extremist religious leaders			0
the delegation met with leaders of @entity75 / @entity74 , which , for more than 40 years , has created a model community of @entity19 - @entity42 coexistence , including a @entity78 that has trained thousands of youths and teachers to help create a humane , egalitarian and just society			2
and they met with leaders of @entity84 who have lost loved ones in the conflict but have turned their anger and loss into constructive work to advance peace			2
although many of the @entity21 faith leaders in the delegation had some exposure to the @entity10 , this was a new experience for our colleagues from @entity22 , which does not have diplomatic relations with @entity3			1
for them , the trip was one of several thousand miles as well as one of cultural and historical assumptions			0
the @entity22 delegation that participated in our mission deserves credit for doing what so few leaders in the world do today : having the courage to cross a great divide with an open mind to better understand the " other			2
" all delegates came to better understand the competing narratives that fuel the conflict in the region			0
for more than 60 years , a just solution to the @entity10 conflict has eluded the greatest statesmen of our time			1
perhaps it is time for a different strategy			0
let 's call it an @entity130 peace strategy			1
in the field of conflict resolution , mediators help disputing parties peel back layers of difference until they reach common ground on which both parties can agree			2
in the @entity10 , that common ground is our common ancestor @entity140			1
@entity140 did not build walls			1
he built wells to sustain all those around him with life - giving water			2
he did not exclude anyone from his home , opening all four flaps of his desert tent so that any wayfarer , coming from any direction , would feel welcome and share in his hospitality			2
that is why we are taught that the core character trait of anyone true to the @entity130 tradition is compassion			1
no peace plan will ever work in the @entity10 until there is a wholehearted commitment to get @entity17 , jews and @entity20 to recognize that the core values they share from @entity140 transcend political ideologies , flags , national anthems and even geography			1
they must be educated in the same classrooms , join hands in launching social action projects to help the most vulnerable , visit each others ' places of worship and then visit each others ' homes to drink coffee and become friends			0
if we could promote projects that bring @entity3 and @entity42 face to face , it would begin to plant the seeds for peace for future generations in a way far more enduring than the signing of a treaty by heads of state			0
let us try a new strategy , one that goes back to the faith of our common ancestor @entity140			1
start with that , and peace will follow			0

the stalled @entity10 peace process is getting little public attention
*interfaith* delegation *toured* @entity10 in *search* of answers
the three major faiths in @entity10 share tradition traced back to @entity140
peace could be built on @entity140 's core value of compassion for the *stranger*
