-- it may not be keeping track of your phone calls , but one government agency may be keeping your garage door shut			1
a recent radio communications update at the @entity9 's @entity8 near @entity10 , @entity11 , reportedly is causing hundreds of nearby residents to have difficulty accessing their garages			1
the new radio system operates at the same radio frequency needed to operate automatic garage door remotes , the military said			1
the frequency update caused garage doors to be unresponsive to owner remote controls			1
residents report trying several methods , including replacing the remote 's battery , to get the controls to work			0
the @entity27 reports that up to 500 residents have put in complaints with the @entity30 of @entity10 because of the sudden malfunction			2
" on sunday , i came home , sat in front of the garage in my car and pressed the remote seven or eight times before the door finally opened , " @entity32 told the @entity27			2
" i was not even 10 feet away			0
" the newspaper also noted the new system was installed for updating emergency communications , and that the complaints of nonresponsive garage doors come from up to 15 miles away from @entity8			1
@entity8 is the home of the @entity44 and is a site of leading communication development for the @entity9			2
it employs 15,717 military and 7,112 civilians and boasts of several partnerships with the @entity10 community			2
however , this incident has frustrated some residents , who complained about the lack of advance notice about the installation			0
a spokesman from the base said warnings were planned , but the system was up and running quicker than anticipated			0
" @entity8 intended to conduct widespread public notifications on this transition ; however , testing began earlier than expected , " spokesman @entity61 said in a statement			0
@entity61 's statement notes that frequencies between 380 megahertz and 399.9 megahertz have been reserved for government and military uses since @entity70 , though manufacturers of garage door remotes may choose to use these frequencies if they think there is low risk of interference			1
as a result , those near military bases may experience interference on occasion			0
the @entity81 categorize garage door openers as operating on an " unlicensed basis " of radio frequencies , the statement said , and must " accept any interference that may occur from the authorized users of radio frequencies			1
" the interference is not a cause for safety or privacy concerns ; it will not open garage doors but temporarily keeps the remotes from working			0
the @entity10 paper reported that interference has been reported in other places since 2004 , including @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100			0
for now , residents experiencing interference can wait for @entity8 to fix the issue , or shell out $ 150 to $ 500 for new systems that can withstand the interference , according to the paper .			1
