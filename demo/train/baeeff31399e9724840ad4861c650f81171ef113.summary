-- sports seasons come and go , but a long - running debate about the use of a @entity5 nickname and logo by @entity7 athletic teams appears nowhere close to a final outcome			1
a flurry of activity this week highlights the wide divisions over the @entity14 nickname and logo			1
those supporting the nickname -- including some @entity18 -- filed petitions asking for a vote this summer on the issue			2
the university announced wednesday it is required to resume using it because of the filing of the petitions			2
the @entity25 , which agreed five years ago to retire the nickname , and the state 's attorney general will hold a conference call next week to discuss legal options in the imbroglio			1
the board of education and university system want an end to the whole matter			1
" we 've heard from all sides			0
there certainly are people who said they want to keep it , " @entity38 , public affairs consultant for the university system , told @entity0 thursday			2
" but the position again is , we should focus on education and this is robbing and stealing too much from the focus			2
it ( education ) is becoming collateral damage			1
" more damage comes in the form of sanctions by the @entity52 , which has a policy against mascots " deemed hostile or abusive toward @entity18			1
" in 2005 , the @entity52 sought to end the controversy surrounding such mascots by ordering some 20 schools whose nicknames and mascots they deemed " abusive in terms of race , ethnicity or national origin " to either get @entity5 permission to use their name and likeness , or to come up with new ones			1
@entity69 is the last holdout in the @entity52 's campaign			1
the @entity52 reiterated its stance on sanctions wednesday , saying the " university is subject to the terms of the policy if it uses the logo and nickname			1
" " those terms include not being able to host @entity52 championship events and a prohibition against using the nickname and imagery on uniforms for student - athletes , along with cheerleaders , ( the ) mascot or band members , in any @entity52 championships , " said @entity79 , @entity52 director of media relations , in a written statement			1
" the @entity52 sanctions are not a good thing , " @entity38 said			1
" i have never seen the @entity52 back down			1
" in 2007 , the @entity25 agreed to drop the @entity14 nickname by august 15 , 2011 , in accordance with the @entity52 's policy			1
but that move was met with opposition			2
the state legislature in early 2011 passed a law requiring the university to use the @entity14 nickname			1
that law , however , was repealed in november 2011 when legislators approved a bill that allowed the school to stop using the moniker			0
@entity107 who favor the mascot responded with a two - pronged strategy			0
on one had they are calling for the state constitution to be changed to stipulate the use of the @entity14 name			1
if certified , that proposal would be on the november ballot			0
supporters have until august to submit signatures to gain certification			0
the other effort calls for voters to decide in june whether to repeal the law that permitted the school to drop the name			0
petitions backing that move were filed tuesday with secretary of state @entity127			2
the state requires 13,452 certified signatures to put a law repeal issue before voters			0
@entity69 has about 684,000 residents			0
petition supporters said they turned in more than the minimum number of signatures			0
" by filing the petitions last night , the law as passed in early 2011 is now again in effect , " @entity127 told @entity0 on wednesday			0
" the law passed in november 2011 is now suspended			0
i have 35 days to review the petitions			0
if i find the petitions sufficient , it will be certified for the ballot			0
if not , the bill passed in november will again become the law			0
" in the meantime , university president @entity145 said the school , located in @entity149 , is resuming the use of the name and logo			0
" i want to reaffirm our respect for the laws of the state and the processes guaranteed under the @entity159 , " he said in a statement			0
there are still vestiges of the nickname on campus , including an ice hockey arena featuring a statue and hundreds of @entity14 logos			1
while fightingsioux.com still links to the athletics department , the website now goes under a different web address and does not have the previous logo , a profile of a @entity14 warrior			1
@entity173 will be paying close attention to how the issue plays out			0
as commissioner of the @entity177 , he is overseeing @entity69 's ascent from @entity180 obscurity to the far more lucrative stage of @entity182 " when we invited ( @entity69 's football team ) into the conference , this was not an issue , " he said last summer			1
citing the conference 's " close , close ties to native american tribes " and the threat of boycotts , @entity173 said he has been on ' heightened alert ' wednesday , @entity69 's conference membership -- slated to begin july 1 -- could be rescinded if the college presidents within @entity177 so decide , he said			1
the 13 college presidents -- including @entity145 of @entity69 -- are scheduled to meet in early june , according to @entity197			0
the @entity52 requirement on @entity5 nicknames has resulted in varied responses among the targeted schools			1
the @entity202 became the @entity203 ; the @entity204 became the @entity205			0
other schools satisfied the mandate by tweaking their name , such as @entity209 , where the @entity210 are now known as the @entity211			0
others , like the @entity213 , whose name does not affiliate with a specific tribe , were allowed to keep their name so long as @entity5 logos and imagery were eschewed			1
schools with higher - profile athletic programs fared better			2
the @entity222 , @entity223 and @entity224 each obtained permission from their respective namesake tribes to stay the course			0
but the @entity14 -- winners of seven national championships in men 's ice hockey -- were denied such an endorsement from the @entity233 of the @entity234			2
but another tribal body , @entity236 , has expressed support for the nickname			2
a website , savethefightingsioux.com , calls for keeping the nickname and logo			2
it lists the @entity243 , whose members were among those who filed the petitions			0
" we ask you to boldly ' @entity250 ' with us , the @entity251 , as we stand on principle against an injustice attempting to rid @entity7 of its traditions and customs , " the website reads .			2

@entity7 is the last holdout over an @entity52 policy on @entity5 nicknames
