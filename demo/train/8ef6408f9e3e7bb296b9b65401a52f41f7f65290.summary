-- the @entity2 @entity1 on wednesday announced penalties totaling $ 80,800 following a worker - safety investigation into a stage collapse last summer that fatally injured seven people and injured dozens of others before a scheduled concert at the @entity9			1
the largest fines -- totaling $ 63,000 for what the agency said were three " knowing violations " -- were levied on @entity14 , which built the stage structure and leased it to the fair			1
metal scaffolding supporting the stage lights fell onto a crowd of fans and workers as a storm swept through the @entity23 fairgrounds on august 13 , 2011 , right before country music group @entity24 was to perform			1
@entity26 , based in @entity27 , @entity2 , was cited for " failure to develop and implement an @entity29 , the failure to develop a risk assessment plan , failure to maintain and use current engineering calculations and documentation , and failure to provide appropriate , qualified supervision , " the labor department said			1
the company strongly disputed those findings in a statement to @entity0 wednesday night			1
the citations come as the @entity41 ( @entity42 ) released the findings of a six - month investigation focusing specifically on employee safety standards			1
two workers were among the people killed			0
@entity1 commissioner @entity48 said the citations of @entity26 indicated " the most serious safety violation			2
" " the evidence demonstrated that the @entity54 was aware of the appropriate requirements and demonstrated a plain indifference to complying with those requirements , " @entity48 said during a morning news briefing at the state capitol in @entity23			2
also , the @entity9 was cited for failing to evaluate and assess " all conditions and the related appropriate safety measures " at the fair 's concert venues			1
the " serious violation " resulted in a $ 6,300 penalty			1
and the local chapter of the stagehands union ( @entity66 ) and @entity67 were cited for four violations and fined $ 11,500 for failing to make sure the load - bearing roof was properly secured			1
state fair commission chairman @entity70 issued a statement wednesday saying the organization has created a new position of emergency management officer " to assist with improving emergency action plans , and completed emergency evacuation training for all employees			1
" he also noted that two independent investigations are ongoing " regarding the structural collapse and decision - making analysis			2
" " our hearts continue to go out to the victims and families of those whose lives were forever impacted by the events of aug. 13 , " @entity70 said in the statement			0
" we also appreciate the due diligence of the @entity2 @entity1 in compiling its report			1
" an attorney for the @entity66 told @entity91 affiliate @entity90 that the state fair was making " scapegoats " of the stagehands union			1
" ( this is ) an attempt to deflect attention away from themselves , " @entity90 quoted attorney @entity95 as saying			0
" the @entity9 and @entity9 personnel are ultimately responsible here			0
and they 're looking for scapegoats and we happen to be first in line			0
" @entity102 , a spokesperson for @entity14 , said the company disagrees with the investigation 's findings " and strongly object to their classification as knowing violations			1
" " @entity110 was consistent and clear with the @entity9 about the limitations of the temporary roof structure in high winds or severe inclement weather , " she said in an e-mailed statement			0
" each year for nearly a decade , we warned the @entity9 , in writing , that ' the roof or top shall not be used in high winds and or severe inclement weather			0
high winds meaning 25 mph and above , ' " @entity102 said , quoting a clause highlighted on a " conditions of contract " page that also was attached to the e-mail sent to @entity0			0
" in the case of the structure used for the @entity24 concert , the threshold was 40 mph for evacuation , " @entity102 's e-mail stated			2
" on the evening of the incident one of our employees reconfirmed with @entity9 leadership that if there was lightning or wind speeds of 40 mph or more , the area should be evacuated			0
" despite these warnings , the @entity9 , who controlled the venue , and @entity24 , who controlled the concert , refused to postpone the concert and failed to implement an evacuation plan away from the temporary roof structure			0
" the @entity145 estimated winds of 60 - 70 mph were raking the area when the incident occurred			2
forecasters had warned that heavy rain and strong winds would hit the fair nearly two hours before the storm moved through			1
video shows the blue canvas top fraying and flapping just seconds before the steel scaffolding gave way and fell onto the " @entity157 , " a section usually occupied by @entity24 's most ardent fans			2
authorities had gone onstage just four minutes earlier to warn the crowd to seek shelter , according to a timeline of events released by investigators the day after the accident			0
@entity24 , the @entity168 - based duo of @entity169 and @entity170 , escaped injury since they had not yet come onstage			2
they later posted a message on @entity173 saying they were " stunned and heartbroken for the fans			0
" in november , the families of four people who were killed filed a lawsuit against @entity24 , contending it was the performers ' responsibility to decide whether the show would go on and that they had " ultimate control over the lighting " that fell on many of the victims			0
@entity24 's representative has said the group would offer no comment about the lawsuit			0
@entity0 's @entity189 , @entity190 and @entity191 contributed to this report .			0
