-- august 23 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : back from the weekend and ready to launch into 10 minutes of commercial - free headlines , including dueling protests , an @entity4 announcement and one teen 's push for peace			1
first up : @entity24 @entity25 : first up , a recall gets bigger as more than half a billion eggs are pulled off the shelves			1
now last week , we told you about an egg producer that did a recall because of concerns about salmonella , a bacteria that can be found in eggs , and it can make you very sick			1
well now , another producer is involved			2
experts think that around 1,300 people have gotten sick from the tainted eggs			1
one doctor offered some safety tips			2
@entity44 , @entity45 : eggs are actually a great source of protein and a lot of the good vitamins			1
but there are other sources			2
so , if you 're really concerned , have some tofu , other things like that			2
they 've got to be less than 40 degrees			2
store them individually , like you 've done , and then cook them			2
they 've got to be more than 160 degrees for 10 minutes			2
@entity66 @entity25 : in @entity68 , things are tense over plans to build an @entity66 center with a mosque a few blocks away from @entity73			1
that 's one site of the 9/11 terror attacks			1
and sunday , hundreds of people turned out in protest , both against the plan and for it			1
most of the protesters are opposed to the plan ; they 're opposed to the @entity66 center			2
they argue that it 's insensitive to build it so close to @entity73			1
according to a @entity0 poll that was taken earlier this month , nearly 70 percent of @entity86 agree with them ; they are against the plan			2
but on the other side of the debate , those folks who support building the @entity66 center argue that the issue is freedom of religion			2
@entity68 governor @entity94 says there are no laws that prevent the construction of the @entity66 center			1
but he says the controversy shows him that " the wounds of 9/11 have n't healed			2
" one of the leaders of the group that 's behind the development of the @entity66 center says that there are no plans to move the construction site , at least not for now			1
@entity106 @entity107 , @entity14 : time for the shoutout ! what is the name of the @entity112 country that 's highlighted on this map ? if you think you know it , shout it out ! is it : a ) @entity120 , b ) iran , @entity122 ) @entity5 or @entity123 ) @entity119 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the @entity124 of @entity4 is highlighted here			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! drone unveiled @entity25 : and @entity4 is making a new type of military weapon			1
it 's a long - range drone , an unmanned arial vehicle			1
they 're pretty common in modern combat			2
the @entity86 uses something called a predator drone			2
and @entity86 officials say the unmanned vehicles help cut down risk for troops because no one actually has to be on board piloting it			2
@entity4 started producing its drones back in february			2
the first ones were unveiled yesterday			0
@entity4 officials say the drones have a range of about 620 miles and can carry different types of bombs and missiles to hit ground targets			0
they claim that the goal of the new vehicles is to prevent aggression against their country			0
meanwhile , @entity4 has started fueling a new nuclear energy plant			0
it says the plant will help make electricity			0
but other countries , including the @entity86 , think @entity4 may try to make nuclear weapons			0
@entity163 @entity25 : moving east from @entity4 to @entity5			0
we 've told you about the severe flooding there			0
we 're starting to see some of the aftermath of that flooding in terms of disease : skin diseases , respiratory infections , malaria			0
the @entity174 says nearly a million @entity5 are suffering some kind of illness			0
the floods are making a massive impact on the country 's economy as well , and @entity181 has more on that			1
( begin video ) @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 : more than half of @entity5 's people live off the land			1
now , much of the land is covered by dirty water , and the people are reduced to misery			1
@entity194 , president , @entity196 ; @entity197 : it 's hard to imagine a country that is least prepared or had the thinnest of margins to be able to absorb a shock of this type			1
@entity204 : under all of that water , there are homes , farms and factories , bridges , roads and irrigation canals			0
five hundred thousand tons of stored wheat is now reported ruined			0
add potentially two million bales of cotton			0
food prices have been rising in markets around the country			0
@entity5 's long - standing electricity shortage is suddenly so much worse because power plants have been shut down or damaged as well			1
the county 's high commissioner to @entity223 told the @entity225 news agency that it might cost $ 15 billion to rebuild from the devastation			1
and @entity5 -- already deeply in debt -- will have less money to spend , because its ability to earn with exports has been dramatically reduced			0
@entity231 : what the floods have done is to virtually wipe out an infrastructure , agricultural infrastructure that it depended upon for its wheat exports			0
and because about 60 percent of the population worked in the agricultural sector , so the amount of investment that will need to go in just to bring @entity5 back up to a status quo , a status quo that was not sufficient , is going to cost billions and billions of dollars			0
@entity204 : the world has responded with millions in aid			0
the @entity245 alone has pledged $ 900 million more			0
but @entity5 will need so much more money than that , even long after the water is gone			0
( @entity249 ) is this legit ? @entity250 , @entity14 : is this legit ? the demilitarized zone , or @entity252 , divides @entity253			0
legit ! it was established in 1953 as part of the agreement that ended the fighting in the @entity259			0
peace mission @entity25 : the fighting ended a while ago , but technically , @entity253 and @entity262 are still at war			0
and the @entity252 is patrolled at all times by troops from both countries			0
it does n't sound like the kind of place you might want to spend a vacation , but there 's a 13 - year - old from @entity274 who thought so			1
and @entity276 introduces him and his hope to us			1
( begin video ) @entity281 , @entity282 correspondent : he 's a 13 - year - old boy turned international envoy			1
@entity284 , peace advocate : hello , my name is @entity181 , and i 'm the founder of a youth humanitarian environmental group called " @entity289			1
" chang : just off a plane , @entity290 greeted throngs of global media after a mission to one of the most isolated nations in the world			0
@entity298 : actually , i was really kind of scared at first			0
but once i got there , i was kind of relieved because i felt , in my experience , very safe			0
chang : as a @entity303 from @entity274 , his idea was simple but ambitious : to convince @entity306 to plant a children 's peace forest in the demilitarized zone that separates @entity253 , two nations technically still at war			1
@entity298 : i would really like , if possible , maybe of children from both countries to be able to meet and play with each other , like a big playground			0
chang : how did you feel when he came up with this idea ? @entity317 , @entity319 's mother : i was like , really ? you want to go to @entity320 , and when ? and then he was so adamant and so strong about how he felt , i was like , okay			1
i was cool with it			0
@entity323 , @entity319 's father : i said , no way			1
his father , originally from @entity262 , was hesitant , but eventually agreed and the family embarked on their journey			0
@entity298 : my idea for the mission statement of the children 's peace forest is " above politics , above borders , above ideology , above conflict			1
" chang : @entity181 's humanitarian work started three years ago			1
he created @entity340 , a superhero who teaches kids to protect the environment			0
he 's met with president @entity343 and other top leaders			1
he 's filed more than 30 ireports on @entity0 and waged a seven - day campaign to urge @entity347 's to recycle			1
but his trip to @entity320 would be the most challenging and eye opening			1
@entity298 : i went to a school children 's palace and i found out the children there are very talented			1
they learned piano and did it really impressively			0
the accordion , calligraphy , embroidery			0
chang : he did n't meet with @entity306 , but says he did meet with other government officials who told him a peace treaty would have to be signed before there could ever be a children 's peace forest			1
@entity298 : well , i was a little disappointed , but i 'm going to keep trying			0
maybe if i keep trying , i do n't know , maybe eventually , hopefully			0
chang : @entity276 , @entity0 , @entity366			0
( @entity249 ) before we go @entity25 : all right , before we go today , we 've got a story that 's just too doggone cute -- or ugly -- to ignore			1
this is @entity370 , a two - year old @entity371			1
but she 's only half the story			1
look down by her leg			0
that 's a baby squirrel ! two of those were abandoned under the tree			2
@entity370 's owner took in the squirrels , but @entity370 decided to take over , adopting the little ones			2
we 've actually been holding on to this video for a few days , kinda waiting to show it off to you			0
goodbye @entity25 : i guess you could say we 've been squirreling it away			0
chihuahuas , squirrels , puns : it 's the little things on @entity0			2
