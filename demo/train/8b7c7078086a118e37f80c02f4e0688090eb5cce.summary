-- @entity1 did try to give up the shoe repair business once			1
it was 1991 , and he was about to turn 72			0
he figured he was ready to stop fixing footwear and spend more time in the yard			1
that lasted about three months			0
@entity1 and his wife were on @entity8 and needed a little extra income -- but mostly , he missed his customers			1
now , at 93 , this gentle craftsman with a thick @entity13 accent , a faded blue apron and a gift for gab is still charming customers in the shop behind his home in @entity20 , @entity21			1
@entity1 is a beloved fixture of @entity20 , a town of 2,400 people in the @entity24 between @entity25 , @entity21 , and @entity26 , @entity27			1
he has been featured in countless local newspaper stories and was the grand marshal of the town 's 2008 @entity31 parade			2
" i make other people happy , or i think i do -- they say i do , " @entity1 said in an interview with @entity0 this week			1
" people want to know when i 'm going to quit , i say when my toes are turned up			2
" after learning about @entity1 years ago , a local filmmaker thought the cobbler deserved a little more recognition			1
@entity41 's 2012 short documentary about @entity1 , " @entity40 , " won the @entity42 in the 3rd @entity43 announced tuesday			1
the three - minute film was picked by audience votes from among 36 nominees in six categories of audience storytelling			0
seven winners , seven stories : meet the 2013 @entity43 recipients " this was a wonderful look of what @entity55 can be at its best , " one viewer wrote			2
" we need more mr. @entity59 in our society			0
" @entity1 , who does n't own a computer , is a little baffled by the attention			2
" i guess people are just interested in me			0
i 'm thankful for that , " @entity1 said			2
" i guess they think it 's pretty fascinating to be an old man still fixing shoes			1
" when @entity69 made the film , he said he felt he needed to share @entity1 's story before it was too late			1
" the fact that he 's still on his feet ... his attitude about people and business is just so uplifting , " said @entity69 , a former news photographer for a couple of @entity75 affiliates in @entity27			2
he went into the shop one day , asked for an interview , and edited the piece that night			0
@entity1 was 17 when he first started repairing shoes during the @entity84			1
horseback riders make up much of his business , but over the years , he has given new life to all types of leather products , including children 's baseball gloves , handbags and even a lady 's corset ( that was probably his oddest request , he says )			2
@entity96 ? we think so in the late ' 60s , he made a pair of shoes from scratch for a crippled child with clubfeet who walked on the sides of his feet			0
he used modeling clay to make molds of the child 's feet and then chilled the molds in the refrigerator so he could stretch the leather over them			0
" i can still remember the molds sitting in the fridge , " said @entity1 's youngest son , @entity114			1
" there were n't as many resources to help such children like there are today			0
" his customers know @entity1 as the guy who can " renew the hopeless loafers and make your old favorite live again with a shine , " said @entity127 , a health care executive and longtime customer from nearby @entity130 , @entity21			1
he 's had @entity1 fix several pairs of @entity132 and @entity134 loafers and boat shoes			1
" i always say ' wow ! ' by reflex when i get mine back			0
you would too , " @entity127 said			0
but even if @entity1 had quit fixing shoes years ago , @entity127 said , it would still be worth the trip into @entity1 's @entity141 to see the owner grinning			1
a few other facts about @entity1 : he prefers apple cobbler to peach ( with vanilla ice cream ) , and he really is as sweet as he seems , according to @entity147 himself owns five pairs of shoes , favoring those made by @entity151 and @entity152 , which he says are " about the best you can get			1
" the cobbler business is n't what it used to be			0
with shoes made more cheaply , most people would rather buy a new pair than pay $ 45 for a new set of heels and soles			0
that 's one of the reasons @entity1 's son , who worked alongside him for a few years after high school , did n't follow him into the business			1
but horseback riders and other loyal customers give @entity1 a steady business , enough to keep the shop open three days a week			2
he also looks after an older son with disabilities			0
both those endeavors helped keep him going after the death in 2001 of his wife , whom he cared for until she died , @entity114 said			0
@entity1 is hard of hearing now , and slower on his feet ; but if you go into the shop , he still greets you with a cheerful smile , asks where you 're from and tries to figure out if he knows your relatives			2
he 's always loved to talk			0
" i 've made more friends than i 've made money , i imagine , " he told a reporter once			0
" i 've got the nicest customers in the world			0
