a mother who had never set her eyes on her baby , a poor villager who had n't worked for years , an old man who had never seen his pension money -- these are just some of the thousands of blind @entity6 whose lives have genuinely been transformed by the treatment of a woman who they call their " miracle doctor			1
" dr. @entity12 , the head of the eye department at @entity6 's largest hospital , @entity13 , has dedicated her life to help to restore sight in a country where tens of thousands of people are suffering needlessly from a condition that is curable			1
cataracts , a clouding of the lens in the eye , is one of the main culprits of blindness in @entity6 , a country of barely two million			2
for @entity12 , this is simply unacceptable			0
" you ca n't call yourself a progressive country or nation if you still have people going blind from cataracts today , " says @entity12 , who also runs eye camps across the southwest @entity30 country where she treats those who do not have the means to pay for a simple surgical procedure			1
a tireless worker , @entity12 reckons that she and her team have so far restored the sight of more than 20,000 people			1
" there 's no money in this world that can pay the joy of someone who was so blind for so many years and then suddenly they regain their vision , " @entity12 says			2
" you 're changing the life of so many people , you make it easier for them and it is also productive for the country -- you help people who are taking care of their grandchildren , contributing to the economy of the country , this is very , very good , " she adds			0
growing up in @entity30 - occupied @entity63 -- as @entity6 was then known -- @entity12 's desire as a teenager was to become a fashion designer			1
but she soon found that she had to give up her dream			0
at the age of 15 , @entity12 was one of the many @entity6 who went through @entity70 to @entity71 to join the liberation movement that ultimately led to @entity6 's independence			1
there , she was housed in camps of the @entity76 where she was told that becoming a fashion designer was not an acceptable career path			0
" in an independent @entity6 we need medical doctors , not fashion designers , " @entity12 remembers being told at the time by @entity80 , who is currently @entity6 's prime minister			1
so instead of following her fashion dream , @entity12 was sent to @entity85 to become a doctor and in 1989 she returned to a liberated @entity6 , keen to practice occupational health			1
she was urged , however , to specialize in ophthalmology and help to tackle @entity6 's bigger problem of blindness			1
in the beginning , @entity12 remembers , people were a bit suspicious about having a doctor operating on their eyes			2
but after the first successful medical procedures , everybody started asking for help			0
" there was that few operations , people who came really blind with visual acuity who could only see light perception -- they went back seeing again and that 's how the message spread like wildfire , " says @entity12			2
" for them this was really a miracle and they will even tell me that this is like @entity113 when he was making the blind see again and that 's i think why they call me the miracle doctor , " she adds			0
@entity12 's amazing energy and dedication has also inspired others to join her mission to rid @entity6 of preventable blindness			1
as a result , a mix of international groups like @entity124 ( @entity124 ) and seeing without @entity125 and individual doctors travel to @entity6 every year , dedicating their time and expertise to help poor people to restore their sight			2
" dr. @entity12 is a remarkable woman , " says @entity133 of @entity124			0
" she is inexhaustible , she is an incredible physician , very capable but also able to motivate people and she 's been able to get the governor of @entity6 to support her and her colleagues			0
" she does provide an amazing service , she works all the time here , 12 hour days , day after days , seven days a week , she never stops , " he adds			0
and while @entity12 had to give up her teenage dream of forging a career in fashion , she says she has no regrets -- she has been able to serve her people and make a profound difference in thousands of lives			0
" if you give , you get back , and the getting back is to see people going home very satisfied with bright faces -- coming in looking down and depressed and then they go back home seeing again , that is so rewarding and it keeps you , it makes you come back all the time , " she says .			0
