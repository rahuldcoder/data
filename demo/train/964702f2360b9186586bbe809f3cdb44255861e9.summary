@entity0 -- a 19 - year - old @entity4 bent on committing " violent jihad " was arrested thursday after undercover @entity7 agents foiled his attempt to bomb an office tower in @entity11 , @entity12 , authorities announced late thursday			1
authorities say a suspect tried to set off a bomb attached to a vehicle at the base of the @entity18			2
federal officials said @entity20 , who entered the @entity21 illegally and lived in @entity12 , tried to set off an improvised explosive device attached to a vehicle at the base of the 60 - story @entity18 office tower			1
counterterrorism officials arrested @entity20 on thursday before publicly disclosing a similar , but unrelated , terrorism sting arrest in @entity29 , @entity30 , wednesday			2
a federal law enforcement official familiar with the cases said authorities feared word of the @entity30 arrest could tip off the @entity12 suspect of an undercover sting operation			0
in a criminal complaint filed with @entity20 's arrest , counterterrorism officials said the suspect had been under " continuous surveillance " because of oft - stated determination to inflict damage and death against the @entity21 , which he deemed to be an enemy of @entity48			1
" the identification and apprehension of this defendant , who was acting alone , is a sobering reminder that there are people among us who want to do us grave harm , " said @entity49 , the top federal prosecutor in @entity11			0
after casing a @entity58 in the office tower in july , @entity20 told an undercover agent he would target the facility , according to authorities			1
initially @entity20 told the agent he wanted to conduct the bombing on september 11 , but decided to wait until @entity67 ended september 20 , authorities said			0
" unbeknownst to @entity20 , the @entity7 ensured the [ vehicle - borne ied ] contained only an inert / inactive explosive device , which contained no explosive materials , " the @entity68 said in a written statement			1
@entity20 will make his first court appearance before a federal magistrate judge in @entity11 on friday			0
the charge of attempting to use a weapon of mass destruction carries a potential sentence of up to life in prison and a $ 250,000 fine			0
@entity68 officials said the @entity11 case was unrelated to the similar @entity7 sting in @entity29 , @entity30 , a day earlier when @entity7 undercover agents foiled a plot to bomb that city 's federal building			2
in neither case did authorities find ties to known terrorist groups .			0
