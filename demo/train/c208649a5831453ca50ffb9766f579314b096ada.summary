-- the use of drones to carry out military strikes is controversial , to say the least			1
@entity5 lawmakers and international leaders continue to examine the legality of the unmanned attacks and whether their role in curbing terrorism outweighs the risk of unintended casualties			0
but @entity14 artist @entity13 has made up his mind -- and he 's adopting web and mobile tools to tell his side of the story			1
" there are many ways to approach the use of drones , but being against it , my take is old school : raising awareness , " he told @entity0			2
" this means not only knowing that drone strikes are happening , but knowing how we frame it , how we understand it			1
" his @entity32 is a project that blends art and technology in an effort to show @entity5 , and others , a side of warfare that few will ever see in person			1
the project collects what it says are @entity43 images of the locations of drone strikes			1
the photos are then posted to @entity47 , the @entity50 - owned photo - sharing app more customarily used to share filtered images of skylines , cappuccinos and other much lighter fare			1
from there , they 're pushed to popular blogging platform @entity57 and @entity59			1
the idea , @entity60 said , is to make the strikes " just a little bit more visible , a little closer , a little more real			1
" he notes the irony of using technology , from gps location data to mobile social - sharing , to report on a uniquely high - tech form of warfare			2
" history , like space , is co-produced by us and our technologies , " @entity60 told @entity0			0
" those technologies include satellite mapping , social photo sharing from handheld devices , and fleets of flying death robots			0
" we should engage with them at every level			0
... we have gotten better at immediacy and intimacy online : perhaps we can be better at empathy too			0
" a spokesman for the @entity87 declined to comment to @entity0 about @entity89 or @entity5 drone activity			1
@entity0 explains : @entity90 the largely secretive @entity5 drone campaign against @entity92 and its allies has transformed the nature of modern warfare , becoming a key weapon in the @entity5 arsenal against suspected terrorists			1
advocates see drones as an effective tool in the fight against extremists			2
opponents worry about civilian casualties and loose oversight			2
while used for the past several years , the drone strikes have drawn increased attention in recent weeks since president @entity109 nominated counter-terrorism adviser @entity110 to be the next head of the @entity112			1
@entity110 is considered by many to be the mastermind behind @entity5 drone policy			2
a @entity117 committee vote on whether to confirm @entity110 as @entity112 director is expected at the end of the month			0
the @entity120 estimates that in @entity122 , between 1,953 and 3,279 people have been killed by drones since 2004 -- and that between 18 % and 23 % of them were not militants			2
the nonmilitant casualty rate was down to about 10 % in 2012 , the group says			0
in @entity129 , the group estimates , between 646 and 928 people have been killed in a combination of drone strikes and airstrikes , and 623 to 860 of those killed were militants			1
about 2 % of those killed have been " high - level targets , " the group said			0
@entity60 , who describes himself as a " writer , artist , publisher , technologist and a number of other things " on his website , launched @entity32 in october			0
the @entity47 account now has about 6,600 followers , with about 2,400 on @entity59 and more checking in on the @entity57 blog			1
@entity60 uses media reports and local government sites to find the locales for his images			0
many , he says , are in remote areas where information on exact locations is scarce ; so if a precise location is unavailable he uses satellite views near the reported location			0
" i 'm always concerned about misrepresentation , but i also make it as clear as possible in the project description that these are not exact locations , and they 're the best i can do , " he said			2
it 's definitely far from perfect , and i 'm sure mistakes have been made , but i just try to be clear about that			0
" to some observers , that undercuts the impact of his project			2
" it 's not like you have the exact longitude and latitude of each strike , " said @entity175 , a @entity0 national - security analyst			0
" as an art project , this ( @entity89 ) is interesting , " @entity175 said			1
" as a piece of actual journalism ... it seems quite off			0
" @entity60 also uses information from the @entity187 , a @entity14 independent nonprofit organization which compiles local reports of drone strikes in @entity122 , @entity129 and @entity190			1
the debate over the use of attack drones will no doubt continue , even as @entity5 troops continue to draw down in places like @entity196 , reducing the number of combatants apt to encounter militants face - to - face			0
and @entity60 says he 'll continue trying to put people at the scene of the strikes -- even if it 's only through the screens of their smartphones , tablets or desktop computers			2
" it 's about trying to make it literally visible , " he said			1
" the very nature of this kind of warfare makes the perpetrators , the victims , the landscape , essentially invisible			0
" @entity0 's @entity217 and @entity218 contributed to this story .			0

@entity89 aims to show the impact of drone strikes
@entity14 artist @entity13 uses @entity47 , @entity57 and @entity59 for project
advocates *praise* drones ' effectiveness , while *critics* decry too many civilian deaths
artist : " it 's about trying to make it ( drone warfare ) literally visible "
