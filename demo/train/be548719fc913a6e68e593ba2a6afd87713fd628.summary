-- the @entity1 is about to get three days of september -- in july			1
an unseasonal invasion of cool @entity4 air could put lows in the 40s -- about 10 to 15 degrees below normal -- in parts of @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 and @entity11 into wednesday			1
@entity12 , too , will be wondering what month it is , with lows in the 50s and highs tuesday and wednesday in the low 70s			2
the reason : last week 's @entity19 created some ripples in the jet stream , causing it to dip farther south than it normally does this time of year			1
" it 's not weird to get a dip in the jet stream , but it is weird to get it in july , dipping this far south , " @entity0 meteorologist @entity23 said			1
" so we are getting those cooler than normal temperatures across the @entity33			0
" some examples : â € ¢ @entity35 , @entity9 , will see lows in the upper 40s tuesday and wednesday , with highs in the upper 60s and low 70s			1
monday 's expected high , 59 , is well below the july normal of 75			0
â € ¢ @entity40 , @entity11 , also will see lows in the upper 40s tuesday and wednesday , with highs in the low 60s monday and tuesday			1
the average high for this time of year is 77			0
â € ¢ @entity44 , @entity8 , will see lows in the upper 40s or lower 50s tuesday and wednesday			1
monday 's high will be around 67 -- a departure from the july normal in the low 80s			0
meanwhile , the @entity49 will be getting drenched			0
three inches of rain are possible in the @entity51 and the @entity52 from monday to wednesday			2
storms on monday could be severe in parts of the country , including much of the @entity56 from @entity57 to the north , as well as @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 , @entity62 and @entity57			2
damaging wind and heavy rain are possible			0
by tuesday , the strongest storms should be confined to the @entity51 , and they 'll be mostly along the coast wednesday			0
