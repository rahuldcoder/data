speaking after the meeting , @entity10 said @entity11 , @entity20 and the @entity21 have said they would be willing to go into a grand coalition on the condition of remaining in the euro , offering a possible way out of the impasse			1
but this could still be problematic as the @entity21 has previously said it will only join a coalition if the party which placed second in sunday 's election , the @entity30 , or @entity30 , also joined			1
@entity5 described this as a " grain of hope			1
" he said he hoped he could help form a unity government , adding that " things in @entity0 are quite difficult			2

the country 's lenders have said that if @entity0 does not comply with the bailout terms then payments will stop			2
@entity0 has been forced to impose punishing austerity measures to get international loans that have kept it from defaulting on debts so far			2
