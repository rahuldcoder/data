president @entity0 postponed executive action on immigration , but democrats want voters to know the delay is n't his fault			1
blame republicans instead , according to the latest @entity9 latest talking points			2
@entity0 had weighed action on immigration -- including moves that could allow a path to legal status for millions of undocumented workers -- after congressional action on the issue stalled			1
the president took the brunt of criticism immediately after the @entity21 announced saturday he is delaying any unitary action on immigration until after november 's midterm elections			1
he faced accusations of betrayal , bitter disappointment and frustration			0
and those are from the president 's allies -- democrats and immigration reform proponents who lead communities that voted overwhelmingly for @entity0 in 2008 and 2012			1
since the weekend , @entity9 began targeting @entity21 republicans			0
rep. @entity35 , @entity36 , said monday on @entity38 's " @entity37 " that she is frustrated with the president but added : " the real reality is that these @entity21 @entity34 have refused to work with us , to move a bill that would solve this issue			2
" last year , the @entity44 passed a comprehensive bill that would provide a path to legal status for millions of long - term undocumented immigrants while also strengthening border security			0
@entity21 @entity34 refused to consider the @entity44 bill , which @entity0 and @entity9 claim would pass if put to a vote			1
rep. @entity52 , also a @entity36 @entity53 , said the " first blame " should lie with @entity54 for not doing taking up immigration legislation			0
" now the president is forced to have to take a measure like executive actions , " @entity52 said sunday on @entity38 's " @entity57			0
" the president 's delayed action could protect @entity9 in competitive @entity44 races in conservative states like @entity65 , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 and @entity69			2
by focusing blame on @entity34 , @entity9 likely are trying to placate anger in immigrant communities			1
but the relationship between those communities and the administration is strained			0
immigration advocates are pointing to the 60,000 family members that could be deported before the end of the year as an unfortunate outcome of the president 's political calculation			0
" republicans killed the best chance in a generation to enact landmark immigration reform legislation , " @entity83 , executive director of immigration reform group @entity85 , told @entity38 in a statement			2
" president @entity0 , however , has deported more than 2 million people and failed to deliver on promises of reform , including most recently when he publicly promised to take executive action by the end of the summer			1
" there 's no question , republicans are still blaming the president			0
opinion : to get immigration reform , elect a @entity34 lawmakers urge @entity0 to work with @entity54 on immigration			1

immigration reform advocates *initially* criticize president @entity0 for delaying action
now @entity9 are *spreading* the blame to @entity34 for failing to legislate on issue
democrats are likely trying to placate anger in immigrant communities
