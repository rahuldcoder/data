a global travel alert issued friday by the @entity1 warned @entity2 may launch attacks in the @entity4 , @entity5 and beyond in coming weeks , a threat that prompted sunday 's closure of 21 embassies and consulates			1
the @entity12 government 's actions are in response to growing intelligence that shows a potential for attacks in @entity17 and elsewhere in the @entity4 as well as @entity5 , said @entity12 officials who spoke to @entity19 on condition of not being identified			1
" the threat appears to be much worse than it has ( been ) in a long time , " said a senior national security official in @entity17 , where the government is " on high alert against possible attacks in the days to come			1
" various @entity29 targets -- not just those tied to the @entity12 -- are under threat , according to two @entity12 officials			1
according to three sources , the @entity12 has information that @entity34 members are in the final stages of planning for an unspecified attack			1
one of the sources said that such preparations appeared to have increased in recent days with the approaching end of the @entity42 holy month of @entity43			0
in particular , sunday is @entity44 , or the @entity45 , which is one of the holiest moments on the @entity42 calendar			0
said one @entity12 official : " it all leads us to believe something could happen in the near future			1
" based on intelligence , @entity12 officials said , there was particular concern about the @entity57 in @entity17 between saturday and tuesday			1
president @entity58 -- who , amid regular updates on the situation , has directed officials to take all appropriate steps to protect @entity12 -- praised @entity17 president @entity63 for his country 's efforts following a meeting thursday at the @entity67			1
photos : attacks on @entity12 diplomatic sites still , it 's unclear whether the apparent plot targets that @entity74 nation or one elsewhere -- which is why the travel alert applies so broadly , and why embassies from @entity77 to @entity78 are being closed			1
the expected time of an attack also is n't known , with the @entity12 travel alert noting the threat extends through the end of august			1
" terrorists may elect to use a variety of means and weapons and target both official and private interests , " the alert states			0
" @entity12 citizens are reminded of the potential for terrorists to attack public transportation systems and other tourist infrastructure			1
" @entity97 rep. @entity96 , a member of the @entity98 , called the information " the most specific i 've seen			1
" while the principal attention is on the @entity74 , he stressed to @entity19 's @entity101 that " we ca n't rule anything out			0
" " we are focused on the @entity4 , but it 's a potential series of attacks that really could be almost anyplace , " said @entity96			1
21 embassies , consulates ordered closed the @entity1 made public friday a list of 21 embassies and consulates that will close sunday , which is normally the start of the work week in the countries affected			2
the 17 affected @entity12 embassies are in @entity115 , @entity116 , @entity117 , @entity77 , @entity118 , @entity119 , @entity120 , @entity121 , @entity122 , @entity78 , @entity123 , @entity124 , @entity125 , @entity126 , the @entity127 , @entity128 and @entity17			2
the @entity12 embassy in @entity130 will be closed as normal sunday			2
see the whole list consulates in @entity120 , @entity126 and the @entity127 are also being shut down for the day			0
embassies and consulates in the region typically close their doors or operate with minimal staff on fridays and saturdays			0
the shutdowns could extend beyond sunday , a senior @entity1 official said			2
retired gen. @entity140 -- who until earlier this year was head of @entity142 , responsible for a 20 - country area that includes the @entity4 -- said the decision to close the embassies shows the reality of the threat and the wisdom of @entity12 policymakers			1
@entity12 embassies have been targeted before in places such as @entity17 , @entity153 and @entity154 , he pointed out			2
moreover , @entity34 is one of the terrorist network 's most active and most destructive branches			0
" we have to remember that we 're up against an enemy who kills indiscriminately -- whether it be women , children , diplomats -- and our embassies ... have been one of the targets , " @entity140 told @entity19 on friday			0
" they are showing some proactive discretion here , making certain that we do n't give the enemy an opportunity that we can deny them			0
" questions , concerns after @entity173 @entity67 leaders have been briefed on the situation , @entity175 leader @entity174 told reporters , adding that the travel alert and embassy closings provided " some understanding of the seriousness of the threat			1
" @entity96 , who has also heard such briefings , applauded the government 's decision to close its diplomatic missions			2
" i give them credit , " the @entity188 said of the @entity58 administration			0
" i think the government is doing exactly the right thing here			0
" such bipartisan agreement in @entity195 come at a time politicians are still pushing to seek answers regarding the september 11 , 2012 , attack on the @entity12 consular compound in @entity173 , @entity78 , which killed four @entity12 , including ambassador @entity200			2
since then , @entity188 have been pressing president @entity58 's administration for answers , with some accusing officials of covering up what happened in @entity173 and not doing enough to track down the attackers			0
eight @entity188 lawmakers are asking that incoming fbi director @entity207 brief @entity206 within 30 days about the investigation			0
they say the administration 's inquiry thus far has been " simply unacceptable , " according to a draft letter obtained by @entity19			0
earlier this week , vice president @entity212 and senior @entity1 officials went to @entity206 to discuss embassy security			1
@entity212 also briefed congressional leadership , key committee chairmen and ranking members about the latest threat concerns , a source who attended the meeting said			0
another official said the recent intelligence might not have warranted such a response before the @entity173 attack , given the political firestorm it created for the @entity58 administration			0
on thursday , @entity1 spokeswoman @entity228 said the agency was taking the steps at diplomatic sites out of an abundance of caution			2
@entity19 found embassy attack suspect before @entity235			0
