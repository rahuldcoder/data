-- if anyone wants to transform the old , lifeless , " white - guys - in suits " caricature of the @entity3 , look no further : your dream candidate has arrived			1
@entity7 is an antidote to the stuffy @entity3 establishment that only says " no " and scares next - generation voters away			1
sledding uphill in traditionally @entity12 @entity11 , the young and energetic @entity7 is running to fill secretary of state @entity15 's vacated @entity14 seat , calling himself " a new kind of @entity3			1
" surprisingly , in this bluest of states , he has drawn within single digits of his @entity12 challenger			2
even stranger , perhaps , is that @entity3 money and support has not matched the flood of @entity12 money that is pouring in on behalf of his opponent			1
@entity7 has made it a close race with only a modicum of @entity3 help			1
his opponent , the plodding @entity31 , is tailor - made for an upset			2
a lifelong career politician , @entity31 is the poster boy for everything that 's wrong with @entity35			1
the @entity36 reports , " the only jobs he would ever hold outside of politics were summer gigs as ' @entity41 ' selling @entity42 and @entity43 out of an ice cream truck and a stint as a substitute teacher			0
" @entity31 has spent 37 undistinguished years in @entity48 , unencumbered by accomplishment , warming the same seat since " @entity52 " was a hit , @entity47 was thin and disco lived			2
during his tenure , @entity54 has danced with the @entity35 establishment : he bounced 92 checks in the @entity59 , took a million dollars in campaign contributions from special interests he regulates and voted himself regular pay raises while raising voters ' taxes			2
when asked whether he could recall opposing a tax increase favored by his party 's leadership , @entity31 told reporters he 'd have to get back to them			2
if @entity31 has made @entity35 work , it has only been for himself			1
@entity72 : why @entity7 is just more of the same old , same old a weak candidate , @entity31 is being well advised that he should debate only when necessary and , preferably , after the election			1
in their most recent head - to - head , when @entity7 challenged that @entity31 did n't understand the math of job creation , @entity31 responded , " it 's really not math. it 's just arithmetic , " drawing laughs on @entity81 and despair from his elementary school instructors			1
@entity86 could have been describing @entity31 when he said , " that boy is as sharp as a bowling ball			0
" word inside the community of @entity35 political consultants is that @entity92 are growing increasingly anxious , " seeing ghosts of @entity95 " and not liking their survey data			0
in his fundraising appeals , @entity31 himself is citing a @entity3 poll that calls the race a " dead heat			1
" the @entity101 shows @entity31 with only a 6 - point advantage			0
and a @entity104 poll that had @entity31 leading by 17 points last month shrank that lead to just 7 points last week			0
at this point in the special election in 2010 , @entity95 was behind 9 points yet came from behind to take the race			0
@entity31 has hit the panic button			0
on the @entity116 floor a few days ago , a @entity3 congressman overheard a desperate @entity31 running up to a group of @entity92 , saying he needs a lot more money to win , that he feels it is too close and could lose -- and he 's worried about a repeat of the 2010 election			1
though president @entity123 remains popular in @entity11 , anti-washington emotion is cresting because of the @entity125 , @entity126 , news media snooping and @entity129 scandals , piled on top of @entity132 's stagnant economy and @entity35 's unstoppable indebtedness			1
there is a sense in @entity11 , as everywhere , that " @entity35 is out of control , like 2010 , " one of @entity7 's consultants told me , " and we need to send an outsider to watch the insiders			1
" @entity31 , who spends most of the year at his home in the @entity35 metro area , is on the wrong end of that anti-washington sentiment			1
changing @entity35 is @entity7 's campaign			1
a businessman who worked in private equity , as he explains , " building the retirement savings of firefighters , public school teachers and policemen , " @entity7 graduated from the @entity153 in @entity154 with merit			0
he then gained an invitation to flight school and earned the wings of @entity160 pilot , flying early - warning @entity161 and @entity162 off aircraft carriers			0
that was n't enough for @entity7			0
he asked to transfer to the @entity166			0
though he knew that 80 % never complete the grueling training and was warned he would lose his @entity160 pilot status if he did n't make the cut , @entity7 started again from scratch , committing himself to the elite @entity171			0
he succeeded with distinction , becoming a @entity174 platoon commander			0
there was still room for accomplishment on @entity7 's @entity178 © : after his service , he attended @entity180 and earned an mba			1
a son of @entity184 immigrants , @entity7 speaks fluent @entity185 , as he proved in this week 's debate , responding to one question entirely in the language of his parents ' birthplace			2
a @entity3 that is struggling to reach out to a growing @entity192 audience could n't ask for a better candidate			2
@entity3 chairman @entity194 proved again why he is exactly the right man to be leading his party at this moment of transformation : the @entity198 and the @entity199 , to their credit , put on their big - boy pants and bet early and heavy on @entity7			1
still , though @entity7 is finally getting some help from @entity3 supporters , the most familiar independent @entity203 groups have been sitting unexpectedly on the sidelines			2
as of june 12 , the @entity31 campaign and outside @entity208 groups were outspending the @entity211 forces on tv the final two weeks , $ 5.1 million to $ 1.8 million			0
the old @entity3 establishment is playing it safe			0
@entity214 , who runs @entity216 's @entity215 , has even told heavy - hitting @entity3 contributors to stand down because @entity7 is " too far behind to win			1
" the @entity3 needs @entity216 and @entity215			0
in fact , the @entity3 is dependent on @entity216 : no one else on can raise the hundreds of millions he can to offset what @entity221 groups pour in against @entity3 like @entity7			2
it would be foolish for any @entity3 to wish @entity215 anything but success			0
it 's understandable that @entity216 and @entity214 now want to be cautious and appear as responsible stewards , after blowing $ 300 million of their contributors ' money in 2012 with nearly nothing to show for it , but they are paying a terrible price			0
no doubt the odds augur against any @entity3 in @entity11 , as they did against @entity95 , but @entity7 is a dream @entity3 candidate , running against one of the densest career politicians in @entity35 , in an anti-washington environment -- and he 's within single digits			1
it 's time for the @entity3 to stop paying lip service to @entity192 outreach			2
this is the moment for @entity3 to grow a pair			0
if not , we may not only blow our chance for a next - generation @entity3 to pick up a @entity14 seat but also the party 's chance to turn things around and build momentum for the 2014 elections			1
candidates like @entity7 are the future			2
a @entity3 that wants a future should bet every chip on him			1
@entity7 has adopted the @entity174 ethic of " team first " as his own			0
it would serve all republicans well			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 .			0

@entity261 : @entity7 is a dream candidate for the @entity3
in @entity12 @entity11 , @entity7 is running a tight @entity14 race
he says @entity7 's opponent , @entity31 , represents what 's wrong with @entity35
@entity261 : a @entity3 that wants a future should bet every chip on @entity7
