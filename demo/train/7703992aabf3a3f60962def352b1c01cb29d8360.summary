@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity5 is facing an increasing threat from lone home - grown terrorists , especially among radicalized @entity8 in the prison system , a report from a security think tank said friday			1
there is the potential for a " new wave " of terrorism in @entity5 that is shifting from large - scale bombings requiring considerable amounts of training and operational support toward lone individuals carrying out attacks on a smaller scale , according to the report from the @entity23			1
" rather than sending out trained ' cell leaders ' to conduct preparation for sophisticated operations , @entity25 ( @entity25 ) and other related organizations have recently been content to send out a higher number of lone individuals ( or at least lightly supported ones ) whose chances of success are considerably lower , but whose number and presence raise similar public anxieties , " the report said			2
" eventually , it is reasoned , one of them will be lucky enough to succeed in a major way against high - profile targets in @entity45 countries			0
" one trend contributing to the " new wave " of terrorism is the escalating rate of radicalization of @entity8 in the @entity5 prison system , which the report says may produce as many as 800 " potentially violent radicals			1
" " @entity56 radicalization is believed by the prison authorities to be taking place at a rapid rate , especially in the eight high - security institutions where most terrorist prisoners are kept , " the report said			2
prison probation officers believe that around one in ten of the 8,000 @entity8 prisoners in high - security institutions in @entity1 and @entity67 are successfully targeted , the report said			1
these prisoners were not previously convicted of terrorism offenses , it said			0
" the prison chaplaincy , including its @entity8 adviser , told a parliamentary committee last year that the situation was becoming progressively worse , " the report said			1
" it remains to be seen how much of this ' new radicalism ' may find actual expression in violent acts or attempts at recruitment			0
" the use of more lone individuals in carrying out attacks can be seen in the case of @entity89 - @entity88 cleric @entity87 , suspected in the failed bombing of a @entity92 - bound passenger plane on christmas day last year , the report said			2
the @entity93 last month designated @entity87 a key leader for @entity25 , and he is believed to be hiding in @entity89			0
the report also cited the failed @entity97 bombing may 1 in @entity98 , to which 30 - year - old @entity100 - @entity88 @entity99 has pleaded guilty			0
" this new breed of jihadists have only tenuous links to any major terrorist organisation and receive little training and few resources , increasing the difficulty for the police and intelligence services in tracking and intercepting them , " the report said .			0

prison radicalization may produce as many as 800 new *offenders* , the report says
the report identifies a potential " new wave " of terrorism from individuals
it says the threat may also come from radicalized @entity8 in prison
