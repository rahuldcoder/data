a week after @entity2 - led airstrikes in @entity3 began , lawmakers continued to question president @entity5 's strategy for defeating the militant group @entity6 , which he admitted in a televised interview sunday was more powerful than the @entity2 initially believed			1
echoing sentiments also expressed by @entity9 , the head of @entity2 intelligence services , @entity5 said the government " underestimated what had been taking place in @entity3 " during its civil war , allowing @entity3 to become " ground zero for jihadists around the world			1
" speaking in a taped interview with @entity20 ' " @entity19 , " @entity5 said the terrorists were remnants of @entity23 in @entity24 , which after being diminished by @entity2 forces " went back underground			1
" " over the past couple of years , during the chaos of the @entity3 civil war , where essentially you have huge swaths of the country that are completely ungoverned , they were able to reconstitute themselves and take advantage of that chaos , " @entity5 said , adding later the @entity2 also overrated @entity24 's security forces , which were quickly overrun by @entity6 when it took over the northern city of @entity29 this summer			1
the president stressed that the issue in @entity24 is not simply a military problem ; it 's a political one			1
" this is @entity2 leading the international community to assist a country with whom we have a security partnership with , to make sure that they are able to take care of their business , " he told " 60 minutes			0
" the president added : " if we do our job right and the @entity24 fight , then over time our role can slow down and taper off			1
" @entity2 and its allies strike @entity6 tank , refineries and checkpoints @entity5 spent much of last week rallying international support for his mission against @entity6 at the @entity62 , telling leaders there the fighters represent a " network of death " that must be defeated			1
an air campaign , which began last week and included coalition support from five @entity71 nations , continued over the weekend with strikes on the northern @entity3 city of @entity71 , where @entity75 forces have been battling @entity6			0
the mission is meant to " degrade and ultimately destroy " @entity6 , @entity5 says			2
the @entity77 has remained adamant there wo n't be any @entity2 combat forces deployed in @entity24 or @entity3 , though military " advisers " have been sent to @entity24 in the hopes of fortifying local security forces			2
the president warned the campaign probably wo n't conclude any time soon			2
" there is a cancer that has grown for too long that suggests that it is acceptable to kill innocent people who worship a different @entity90			0
" and that kind of extremism , unfortunately , means that we 're going to see for some time the possibility that in a whole bunch of different countries , radical groups may spring up -- particularly in countries that are still relatively fragile , where you had sectarian tensions , where you do n't have a strong state security apparatus			2
" and that 's why what we have to do is , rather than play whack - a - mole and send @entity2 troops wherever this occurs , we have to build strong partnerships , " @entity5 told " 60 minutes			1
" aides to @entity5 have been careful to underscore that the military operation in the @entity110 wo n't resemble the wars of the past decade , which left many @entity2 skeptical of intervention abroad			2
" we 're doing this in a very different way than in the past , " @entity113 , a deputy national security adviser , said on @entity115 's " @entity114 " with @entity116			0
" we 're not sending in hundreds of thousands of @entity2 troops , " @entity113 continued			0
" we 're not spending trillions of @entity2 dollars			0
what we are doing is empowering local actors with some of the huge assets we can bring to this , like our airpower , intelligence , training and equipping , advising and assisting			0
" the " no boots on the ground " mantra was questioned sunday by @entity77 speaker @entity129 , who said if local forces are n't trained to battle @entity6 quickly enough , @entity2 troops would be required			1
" maybe we can get enough of these forces trained and get ' em on the battlefield			0
but somebody 's boots have to be there , " the @entity139 leader said on @entity141 's " @entity140			2
" @entity129 added later that if @entity5 advanced a new resolution authorizing the military action in @entity3 , he would be willing to call lawmakers back from the campaign trail to vote on it			1
@entity5 claims he does n't need @entity151 ' permission for the air campaign under way in @entity24 and @entity3 , citing the 2001 authorization to go after @entity23			1
he has said he would " welcome " @entity151 showing its support for the mission			0
sen. @entity157 , a @entity158 from @entity159 , said sunday an authorization vote would allow lawmakers -- and by turn the @entity2 public -- to hear more about long - term plans in @entity3			0
" i think the reason that we need to have the debate is so that we can get a better explanation as to what the endgame is in @entity3 , " @entity157 , who sits on the @entity171 , said on " @entity114			0
" " in the end , that 's the check on a war without end : a @entity151 speaking for the @entity2 people who can put an end date on an authorization for military force or put a limitation , so that you ca n't use ground troops , " he said .			0

in a @entity20 interview , @entity5 calls for a political solution in @entity24
the president says he supports partnerships , over the game of whack - a - mole
" if we do our job right *...* then over time our role can slow down , " @entity5 says
house speaker @entity129 questions the " no boots on the ground " strategy
