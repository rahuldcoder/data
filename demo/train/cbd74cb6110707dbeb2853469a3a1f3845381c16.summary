the @entity1 drone killing of @entity1 - born and - raised @entity3 cleric @entity2 , a major figure in @entity5 , has re-energized a national debate over the legal and moral quandaries of a government deliberately killing a citizen			1
the issue has been roiling throughout the @entity1 campaign against terrorism , but friday 's drone missile killing of @entity2 and a second @entity1 , @entity15 , provided a stark , concrete case of a @entity1 policy that authorizes death for terrorists , even when they 're @entity1 , analysts said			1
a government source who was briefed friday morning by the @entity21 confirmed the @entity1 missile strike , which killed two other people in a car in @entity25			1
while president @entity27 on friday applauded the @entity1 action as " a major blow " against @entity5 , civil libertarians assailed the @entity1 decision to kill a citizen			1
" the targeted killing program violates both @entity1 and international law , " @entity33 deputy legal director @entity32 said in a statement			1
" as we 've seen today , this is a program under which @entity1 citizens far from any battlefield can be executed by their own government without judicial process , and on the basis of standards and evidence that are kept secret not just from the public but from the courts			1
" @entity49 presidential candidate rep. @entity48 denounced @entity27 for " assassinating " @entity2 , saying that the @entity1 cleric should have been tried in a @entity1 court			1
" if the @entity1 people accept this blindly and casually , that we now have an accepted practice of the president assassinating people who he thinks are bad guys			1
i think it 's sad , " @entity48 told reporters after a speech in @entity60 , @entity61 , friday			0
" @entity64 was born here , he 's an @entity1 citizen , he was never tried or charged for any crimes , " @entity48 said			2
" to start assassinating @entity1 citizens without charges - we should think very seriously about this			2
" but @entity1 rep. @entity69 , @entity71 - @entity70 , chairman of the @entity72 , said the lethal strike was lawful			2
" it was entirely legal			0
if a citizen takes up arms against his own country , he becomes an enemy of the country			0
the president was acting entirely within his rights and i fully support the president , " @entity69 said			0
@entity64 was believed by @entity1 authorities to have inspired acts of terrorism against the @entity1 , including a fatal shooting at @entity88 , @entity89 , and the december 25 bombing attempt to bring down an airliner flying to @entity92			2
his facility with @entity94 and technology made him one of the top terrorist recruiters in the world , and he was considered the public face of @entity5 , or @entity5			1
@entity99 : @entity1 should n't have killed @entity2 @entity64 was killed about 8 kilometers ( 5 miles ) from the @entity25 town of @entity101 , east of the capital , @entity103 , said @entity104 , a spokesman for the @entity105 in @entity106			1
in what one source called a joint @entity1 military - intelligence operation , the strike was launched at 9:55 a.m. friday , officials said			2
also killed was @entity15 , an @entity1 of @entity114 origin , who specialized in computer programming for @entity5 and authored the terrorist network 's online magazine , @entity116 , officials said			1
much controversy preceded the fatal drone strike			0
@entity64 's father even sued @entity27 , former defense secretary @entity121 and former cia director @entity122 to prevent them from having his son killed , but last december , a federal judge threw out the " unique and extraordinary " suit , leaving open the question of whether the @entity1 government can legally target @entity1 citizens for death abroad without a trial			1
@entity122 : it was legal to kill @entity2 @entity1 district court judge @entity133 dismissed the case on procedural grounds , saying that @entity136 did not have standing to sue and that the officials were immune from such lawsuits anyway			1
last year , @entity139 , director of @entity1 national intelligence , told @entity141 that the government has the right to kill @entity1 citizens abroad if they present a direct threat to @entity1 security			1
" we take direct action against terrorists in the intelligence community , " @entity139 told a @entity72 intelligence committee			0
" if that direct action -- we think that direct action will involve killing an @entity1 , we get specific permission to do that			1
" @entity154 legal analyst @entity153 said friday that the wartime dilemma pivots on how the terrorists targeted by the @entity1 military do n't have a practical access to @entity1 courts to challenge their listing on a government kill list			1
" the @entity27 administration says it is authorized by @entity141 " to issue an order to kill or capture @entity2 , @entity153 said			1
" one of the very important things to point out about this whole legal controversy is that it 's never been in court			0
" no judge has ever evaluated it , and because of the weird legal setting , it 's not clear that a court ever will			0
when you think about @entity176 , @entity2 , they do n't really have the opportunity to go to an @entity1 courtroom , " @entity153 said			2
@entity64 's father 's legal challenge was thrown out of court because it was the son -- not the father -- who was on the kill list , and so the dad did n't have standing , @entity153 said			2
" i can not conceive of how any of these people could ever really get access to an @entity1 courtroom , " @entity153 said			1
" will a court ever judge thumbs up , thumbs down on this policy ? frankly , i doubt it			0
" but @entity194 , an expert on international law at the @entity196 , said the key question concerned not citizenship but location			2
" the real concern is where is this person ? ' she said			0
" he is not in an armed conflict zone , not in a battle zone			0
" @entity64 should have been arrested , she said			0
" it 's basic law , it 's basic morality , that you do not kill people without warning in non-battlefield situations			1
international law is clear about where a battlefield is and is not			0
we do n't get to just make it up because we particularly dislike this guy and we want to declare where he is suddenly a battle zone without doing the hard work of a country to arrest him and put him on trial			0
" international law , she said , says a battlefield where a person can be killed without warning " is a place where there 's intense , organized , inter-group fighting ; that was not the situation			2
" she said the @entity1 was supposed to be leading the world in moving toward more human rights , more zones of peace and more use of law enforcement to respond to criminal suspects , but that has n't proven to be the case			1
" instead , it started with the @entity245 administration but , ironically and even more damagingly , the @entity27 administration has carried this forward			2
in fact they 're doing far more killing away from battlefields than ever occurred in the @entity245 administration			0
" she said people tend to cooperate more with authorities when they know an individual is going to get a fair trial instead of a summary execution			0
but @entity122 , who is now defense secretary , showed no regret			1
" this individual was clearly a terrorist and yes he was a citizen , but if you 're a terrorist , you 're a terrorist			0
that means that we have the ability to go after those who would threaten to attack the @entity1 and kill @entity1			2
there 's no question that the authority and the ability to go after a terrorist is there			0
" @entity64 was born in @entity270 , @entity271 , and lived in the @entity1 until the age of 7 , when his family returned to @entity25			0
he returned to the @entity1 in 1991 for college and remained until 2002			0
it was during that time that as an imam in @entity277 and @entity278 , @entity2 preached to and interacted with three of the men who went on to become hijackers in the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks , according to the @entity282			0
he publicly condemned the attacks afterward .			0

" you do not kill people without warning in non-battlefield situations , " law expert says
" if you 're a terrorist , you 're a terrorist , " defense secretary @entity122 says
president @entity27 defends killing as " a major blow " against @entity5
terrorists do n't have access to @entity1 courts , analyst says
