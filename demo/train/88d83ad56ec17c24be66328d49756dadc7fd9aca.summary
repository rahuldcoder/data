@entity0 , @entity1 -- over the past month , video has emerged from the @entity5 city of @entity6 showing killings and other atrocities apparently committed by security forces in neighborhoods that have opposed the government			1
@entity2 has obtained footage that is among the most disturbing yet -- about a dozen family members killed in one house in what appears to be sectarian brutality			1
@entity2 is confident of the video 's provenance			1
the images show a group of nine men crouched as they move across rooftops , then crawl through a hole smashed in a wall to reach a house on a sectarian fault line that runs through @entity6			1
" we 're rescuing the bodies of the martyrs , " a man 's voice says on the video			1
about a week earlier , the men received information that a @entity36 family had been killed , but it took them this long to launch their mission			2
when they reach the house , they come across a grisly find : the body of a woman lying face down on the carpet			1
in an adjacent room , they find more bodies next to each other in a corner , as though they had been trying to hide			2
one of them , a child , lays with his face frozen in fear , mouth open and arms outstretched			2
on his chest leans another body , its head covered in a khaki - colored cloth			2
a third body , with its head covered in a black cloth , leans against the second			2
beside the pile of bodies , about a foot above the slumped third body , the white wall is splattered red			1
" let the world see , " a voice exclaims on the video			1
" look at this massacre in just one house			0
" the man curses the @entity74 , the @entity75 and president @entity76			0
@entity5 is a nation with a @entity36 majority governed by a minority @entity75 , an offshoot sect of @entity74			0
the video is said to have been shot in the neighborhood of @entity82 last month			0
" oh , look , people , look , " says one man , overcome with emotion as he too curses the regime -- and the world			0
the camera pans to show more bodies in the bathroom			0
suddenly , from another floor , a whimper			0
the men are stunned , and coax a child out of a dark room where he must have been hiding for days			1
the child , in a red , hooded sweatshirt , comes into view , crawling over a body in the doorway to reach the men , who greet him with open arms			1
the men say they do not know who killed the boy 's family or why			0
but they do know , they say , that the killings were a sectarian massacre carried out by thugs allied to the regime			0
@entity2 has attempted to reach the @entity5 @entity110 for reaction but there was no answer			0
the @entity5 government has in the past blamed armed gangs for such attacks .			0

the video shows the bodies of a family in @entity6
" let the world see , " a voice says in a video
a child crawls out from hiding , over a body , to reach his rescuers
