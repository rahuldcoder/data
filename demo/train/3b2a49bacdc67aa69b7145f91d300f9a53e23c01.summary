@entity0 -- buoyed by the runaway success of " @entity3 , " the @entity5 company behind music sensation @entity6 is taking on what has been a tricky market for international record labels to crack -- @entity10			1
" while our previous activity in @entity10 had been putting on concerts occasionally , we will now be setting up an office in @entity10 and aggressively pursue the @entity10 market , " a representative for @entity12 told @entity1 in @entity13			1
@entity12 is one of three @entity5 companies that have largely been responsible for @entity21 -- the @entity5 wave of sugary and attractive girl and boy bands that have taken @entity25 by storm over the past decade			0
and @entity10 has not been immune to k - pop 's allure			1
@entity12 's chief operating officer @entity29 says that acts like @entity6 , boy band @entity31 and rapper @entity32 are extremely popular among @entity10 fans			1
@entity32 's concert on friday and saturday at @entity0 's @entity35 has been completely sold out , he added			0
@entity10 's airwaves have been dominated by @entity10 - language " @entity37 , " but tastes are evolving as the internet gives young people access to different types of music , says @entity43 , operations director of @entity10 - based music industry consultancy splatter			1
however , high rates of piracy on both digital and physical products make it very difficult for a label to discover steady revenue streams			2
" labels can not function or sustain themselves from record sales revenues and so much of their income comes from the ' other ' ways artists generate revenue -- endorsements , commercial appearances , ringtone sales , and live shows , " @entity43 says			0
reflecting these challenges , @entity29 says the company 's initial focus in @entity10 will be on making money from concerts			2
in march , music giants @entity65 , @entity66 and @entity67 , along with @entity10 's @entity68 , settled a hard - fought music - piracy law suit with @entity10 internet company @entity70 that will see the record companies receive royalties and licensing fees			1

@entity10 is aware of the problems facing the industry and is concerned that it has not produced a act of global or even regional standing			0
" @entity6 's success seems to be haphazard but it is n't , " @entity91 , president of the @entity92 told the @entity93 in march			1
" behind @entity3 are great efforts by the @entity5 government and music companies to develop and promote @entity5 pop music			0
the @entity10 government should also try to create better environments for @entity10 pop music			2
" @entity12 's ambitions are not limited to @entity10			1
the company recently incorporated in the @entity105 and speaks of a " digital silk road " spreading k - pop to the world			2
last year , the music video to @entity6 's @entity3 went viral to become the most - watched video on @entity111			1
the song was also the third best - selling single of the year , according to the @entity82 , and has helped boost the financial fortunes of @entity12			0
the company , which went public in @entity116 in 2011 , reported a 45 % increase in net income to 18.8 billion won ( $ 17 million ) in 2012			0
@entity12 said it was too early to say whether they planned to develop local @entity10 acts or simply promote their existing artists in the country			2
but one novel strategy has been adopted by rival @entity124 , which is trying to make inroads into the @entity10 market with @entity127 -- a boy band that performs their songs in @entity131 as well as @entity5			0
