-- every morning before school , nine - year - old @entity1 would undergo a painful procedure			2
her mother would take a burning hot pestle straight out of a fire and use it to press her breasts			0
with tears in her eyes as she recalls what it was like , @entity1 tells @entity0 that one day the pestle was so hot , it burned her , leaving a mark			0
now 18 , she is still traumatized			0
her mother , @entity14 , denies the incident			0
but she proudly demonstrates the method she used on her daughter for several weeks , saying the goal was to make her less desirable to boys -- and stave off pregnancy			0
a study found that one in four girls in @entity23 have been affected by the practice			1
the @entity27 , in its 2010 human rights report on @entity23 , cited news reports and said breast ironing " victimized numerous girls in the country " and in some cases " resulted in burns , deformities , and psychological problems			1
" there are more than 200 ethnic groups in @entity23 with different norms and customs			1
breast ironing is practiced by all of them			1
some mothers use hot stones or coconut shells to flatten their daughters ' breasts			1
doctors believe improved diets have resulted in young @entity23 girls going through puberty early			1
many of them are also becoming pregnant early			0
@entity1 became pregnant at 15			0
her child died at birth			0
she told @entity0 that breast ironing does n't work			1
she hates the practice and wishes her mother had instead talked to her about sex and preventing pregnancy			1
@entity61 argues that if it were n't for the breast ironing , @entity62 would have become pregnant at an even younger age			1
@entity65 has four daughters , and she used the procedure on the first two			0
the third avoided it because her breasts are growing at an acceptable rate , @entity1 says , and the fourth girl is still too young			0
mothers who want their children to finish school before becoming parents have resorted to this drastic measure , and many see nothing wrong with it			1
in 2006 , a @entity82 nongovernmental organization exposed the practice , which at the time was done mainly in secret			2
now , charities have embarked on campaigns to educate mothers in @entity23 that sex education -- not breast ironing -- is the solution to ending teenage pregnancy			1
dr @entity93 , a gynecologist in @entity23 , has seen breast glands that were destroyed			1
she also saw one case of cancer , though she says it could n't be established whether the ironing caused or only exacerbated the cancer			2
" one mother came with secondary burns because the stone she was using to do this breast ironing burned her , " @entity93 says			2
one of @entity93 's patients is a 23 - year - old whose scars are still painful 14 years after her breasts were ironed			0
she has joined the effort to confront mothers about the effects of their actions			2
the challenge for all those trying to stop the practice is reaching parents like @entity65 in villages before a ritual that they say is motivated by love shatters more lives			2
