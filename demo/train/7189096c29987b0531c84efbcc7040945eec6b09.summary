the decision to grant permanent observer status to @entity2 and five other nations by the @entity5 meeting in @entity6 wednesday reflects the heightened interest by some of the world 's most powerful economies in an area rich in oil , gas , minerals , fish and new transport possibilities			1
for new observer nations @entity2 , @entity22 and @entity23 , shorter shipping routes to @entity18 through @entity20 waters could open up prospects of new energy supply options later this decade , such as liquefied natural gas ( @entity27 ) from @entity29 's @entity28 in northwest @entity30			1
it could also lessen @entity2 's dependence on oil and gas shipped from the @entity35 , which must pass through the @entity37 chokepoint of the @entity38			1
@entity39 to @entity2 's interest of getting oil and gas delivered from new pipelines across @entity44 and @entity45 , the potential of the @entity20 trade routes loom large in @entity2 's strategic thinking			1
five years ago , the @entity49 ( @entity49 ) described the vast @entity20 continental shelf as potentially the " largest unexplored prospective area for petroleum remaining on @entity53			2
" a new @entity55 @entity20 policy unveiled by the @entity57 administration last week cites that 2008 study , which estimated that about 13 % of the world 's undiscovered oil and 30 % of its undiscovered gas lies north of the @entity62			1
in a 2012 update , the @entity49 put the mean undiscovered estimate of recoverable oil in @entity29 's @entity20 provinces alone at 28 billion barrels , plus about 27 trillion cubic meters of gas			1
@entity2 is keen to be more than just a customer for this @entity29 oil and gas			2
in february , the heads of @entity2 's three state - controlled oil and gas majors -- @entity74 ( @entity74 ) , @entity75 and @entity76 ( @entity76 ) -- met one of @entity29 's most influential players in the energy sector , @entity80 , chief executive of state - owned oil company @entity82			1
the following month , @entity82 struck a deal with @entity74 , giving it access to @entity20 resources			2
the @entity5 , made up of the @entity55 , @entity29 , @entity86 and the five @entity88 nations -- @entity89 , @entity6 , @entity90 , @entity91 and @entity92 -- was set up in 1996 to coordinate policy in a resource - rich but environmentally sensitive part of the world			1
before wednesday 's decision there were already six observer states : the @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 , @entity104 and the @entity105			0
now the permanent observers are being joined by @entity2 , @entity22 , @entity107 , @entity23 , @entity108 and @entity109 , meaning that all of the key @entity37 economies now have a seat at the @entity20 table , even though they will not have a vote on the @entity5			1
the @entity115 , the other major body seeking observer status , had its application affirmed but " deferred , " a rebuff that is likely related to an unresolved dispute with @entity86 over the fur seal trade			1
both @entity2 and @entity107 already have polar research stations in the northern part of @entity89 , as do most of the other observer nations			1
the @entity20 's importance has gained extra strategic and economic significance as melting ice in the polar region strengthens the feasibility of nations to use the @entity131 ( nsr ) across the top of @entity29 and the @entity133 through @entity86 's @entity20 archipelago			1
@entity86 claims the passage , which links the @entity136 and @entity137 , runs through its internal waterways			0
the @entity55 and other countries contest this , maintaining it is an international strait			0
for @entity2 , the main transportation focus is the @entity131 , which runs along the northern coastline of @entity30 from @entity143 to the @entity144			0
it is open only for about five months of the year , from late june to november or early december , and requires icebreakers to cut a path through the @entity20 ice for specially strengthened oil and gas carriers			2
but the route cuts as much as three weeks from shipping times between @entity18 and @entity45			1
for example , @entity152 to @entity2 's @entity154 port near @entity155 is 13,000 km via the @entity131 , compared with 22,000 km via the @entity157 , @entity158 , @entity159 and @entity38			2
in august to september last year , @entity2 sent its one and only icebreaker @entity161 ( @entity162 ) on a successful two - way test run of the @entity131			0
it plans to add a second icebreaker to its fleet in 2014 - 15			0
over the past two sailing seasons , @entity29 oil and gas companies have tested the route for gas condensate and lng shipments			0
in june 2011 , @entity173 , @entity29 's biggest non-state gas company , sent 60,000 tons of gas condensate from @entity152 to the @entity2 port of @entity154 aboard the @entity175 on a three - week voyage			2
at the end of 2012 , @entity29 state - owned gas giant @entity177 sent a 66,000 - tonne cargo of @entity27 from @entity183 's @entity182 terminal in @entity89 to the @entity22 port of @entity185 between november 7 and december 5			2
the route was cleared by three @entity29 icebreakers			0
for now , the @entity131 is still very much in a test phase			0
according to the @entity190 , an @entity20 - focused information center based in @entity192 , @entity89 , 46 vessels used the @entity131 in 2012 , carrying about 1.26 million tons of cargo			0
that was an increase of more than 50 % from 2011			0
@entity2 envisages exporting consumer goods aboard container ships to @entity18 and receiving lng cargoes via the @entity131			0
@entity173 , for example , is building a new port at @entity200 on the @entity28 peninsula to service the lng trade to @entity45 , with expectations of first gas in 2016 and exports of 15 million tons a year by 2018			0
the @entity131 's shortcomings are considerable : a short sailing season , the cost of hiring icebreakers , the operational hazards of extreme northern waters and the environmental risks of oil spills , collisions or sinkings			0
even so , this @entity20 shipping route is likely to be the focus of intense interest by @entity2 over the next decade .			1

six nations have been granted permanent observer status by the @entity5
@entity2 , @entity22 , @entity107 , @entity23 , @entity108 and @entity109 became permanent observers
the @entity115 's bid has been " deferred " , possibly *due* to an unresolved dispute with @entity86
melting ice in the @entity20 region has opened up the @entity230 , cutting shipping times
