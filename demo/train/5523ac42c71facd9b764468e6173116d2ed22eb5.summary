-- if you can come up with a tale that better illustrates @entity4 's messed - up moral views on abortion , parenting and personal freedom than the story of @entity9 -- the surrogate mother who was offered $ 10,000 by the parents to abort the fetus she was carrying for them -- then you 've got a better imagination than i do			1
let 's run through the story quickly : @entity9 had agreed to be a surrogate and was being paid $ 2,222 a month by the parents for her trouble			1
but an ultrasound scan of the fetus showed serious abnormalities			0
fearing that the child would never lead a normal life -- whatever that may be -- the parents asked @entity9 to abort			2
although the surrogacy agreement contained a clause to this effect , @entity9 refused			0
this is where things became , to put it charitably , unseemly			0
the parents offered @entity34 an extra $ 10,000 to terminate the pregnancy			1
although she said she was against abortion for religious and moral reasons , @entity9 eventually thought she might be able to quash those ethical qualms if the parents paid her $ 15,000 -- $ 5,000 apparently being the difference between " against " and " fine with it			1
" the parents refused , and @entity9 says she regretted the offer			0
how to keep your surrogacy conflict - free from there , events degenerated into the default @entity4 setting for dealing with any disagreement : legal proceedings			2
ultimately , @entity9 decided to have the child , who was born with severe medical conditions and lives with adoptive parents			0
both @entity9 and the parents who paid her to be a surrogate have been roundly criticized for their behavior -- let 's be honest , no party haggling over the price of an abortion will ever win prizes for public morality			1
but in truth , neither @entity9 nor the parents are to blame here			0
the problem stems from our conflicted understanding of what we mean when we say a woman has the right to choose what she does with her body			2
a woman 's right to choose is , of course , the founding principle of the pro-choice movement and its valiant campaign to keep abortion safe and legal -- no matter , for now , that the legality of abortion mostly rests on physician - patient privacy			1
but as a principle , the right to choose does n't just apply to abortion , it also underpins the ethics of surrogacy			1
the moment a woman is n't freely choosing to be a surrogate mother for someone else -- well , then we 're into @entity93 by way of " @entity95 " and @entity96 in " @entity97 , " and nobody really wants to go there			1
the idea of someone forcing a woman to bear their child against her will is horrifying			0
of course , @entity9 was not forced to be a surrogate			1
indeed , she was being rather handsomely paid			0
like most surrogates , she is not financially well - off ; note the distinct lack of fully employed , millionaire surrogate mothers			1
the temptation is to imagine that it is the money that is morally significant			2
@entity9 was being paid , right ? so surely she is obliged to do what she is being paid to do ? it 's a basic capitalist principle : money buys labor			1
there are terms and conditions , of course , but once agreed to , the labor must be carried out as agreed			0
a tempting view , but one which insists that you equate being pregnant with any other type of work , from shelf - stacking to brain surgery			0
this is , of course , nonsense			0
pregnancy is something that only happens to women			2
the whole reason that we embrace the ethical principle of the right to choose is that it goes some way to ensuring that a woman 's biology does not come to define her life in a way that would never happen to men			1
surrogate mother : a new wrinkle in the abortion debate it is a simple matter of justice : the right to choose goes a long way toward ensuring equal rights and opportunities for women			1
turning pregnancy into work that can be bought and sold radically undermines that right			0
if we have any pretensions about defending a woman 's right to choose , then we must defend that right even when , like @entity9 , she chooses to change her mind			1
even when , like @entity9 , her reasoning does n't always seem consistent			0
the alternative is that women 's bodies can be packaged up like any other consumer good and sold off to the highest bidder			0
this might seem to leave parents who seek surrogacy in a difficult position			0
how can they be sure that their surrogate will not change her mind and have an abortion -- or , like @entity9 , refuse to ? the short and uncomfortable answer is that they can not , although the vast , vast majority of surrogacies are completed to the satisfaction and delight of all sides			0
those who seek surrogacy should understand that it is only possible because we believe in a woman 's right to choose			1
i do n't for a moment wish to underestimate the needs and desires of those couples , but i do think it is important for us to recognize that , as an ethical issue , a woman 's right to control her body far outweighs anyone 's rights to have the child they want			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity202 .			2

@entity202 : surrogate mom offered $ 10,000 to abort *reveals* our *confused* moral views
@entity202 : the legal tug of war shows we need to *clarify* what " right to choose " means
if we think she 's obliged to terminate pregnancy , he says , it means money trumps principle
surrogates ca n't be forced , he says ; they have right to end or carry out pregnancies
