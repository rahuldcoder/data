-- if the congressional " super committee " does not reach a deficit reduction deal by wednesday 's legally mandated deadline , i propose we take a page from the @entity8 owners and lock @entity9 out			1
we , the taxpayers , are the owners of @entity9 and if @entity9 wo n't make a deal that helps our nation , then let 's put a big padlock on the doors of the @entity16 and @entity17 -- or at least change the locks and not give them the keys			1
polls show that me and apparently 91 % of my fellow @entity22 have never been more frustrated with the dysfunctional nature of " our " @entity9			1
@entity9 ' approval rating has fallen to an abysmal 9 % -- to put this in perspective , herpes is now slightly more popular than @entity9			2
bed bugs really ca n't be that far behind			0
i 'm not sure who the 9 % of voters are who think @entity9 is doing a good job -- i can only assume it 's @entity9 ' friends and families as well as some of the well - connected lobbyists who have reaped benefits			1
maybe the 9 % are those pleased when @entity9 made history in august after waiting until the last minute to compromise on a budget deal , which led to the first downgrade of the @entity22 credit rating by @entity44 's			1
or possibly the 9 % were impressed when @entity16 @entity45 and @entity46 joined together in a rare moment of bipartisanship a few weeks ago and voted in favor of a resolution by a whopping 396 - 9			0
was this vote to create jobs for the more than 25 million @entity22 who are unemployed or underemployed ? or maybe this vote was to help @entity22 on the brink of foreclosure ? nope , this vote was to address an issue that @entity9 felt demanded immediate attention : affirming that our national motto is : " @entity59			2
" wow , that should really put some food on the table of a hungry family whose unemployment benefits are close to expiring			0
i hope you take the time to " thank " rep. @entity68 , a @entity46 from @entity69 , for leading the courageous charge on that issue			0
instead of a congressional lock out , perhaps @entity72 could host a new tv show entitled : " @entity79 , " where each week members of @entity9 are given a task to help our nation			1
those who fail will be met by @entity72 gleefully declaring : " congressman ... you 're fired ! " i 'm at the point that when i hear about a king in a foreign nation dissolving the legislature in his country , i almost wish our president could do the same			0
despite all its negatives , @entity9 can take credit for one positive achievement : inspiring more @entity22 to become engaged in politics as witnessed by both the rise of the @entity94 and the tea party movement			2
@entity9 ' failures have awakened both the left and the right of the @entity22 electorate			2
i hope that both the @entity94 and tea party groups ( and everyone else in the middle ) can agree on a concrete change to our electoral system , namely : term limits for @entity9			1
even though @entity9 ' approval rating had fallen to 21 % at the time of the november 2010 congressional mid-term elections , the inherent advantages of incumbency for members of @entity9 are so powerful that still 87 % of incumbents in the @entity16 and 90 % in the @entity17 won re-election			1
term limits would mandate a turnover in the composition of @entity9 so that federal elected officials no longer focus on political concerns and making a career out of serving in @entity9 but instead on enacting legislation that benefits all @entity22 in the short time they will serve			1
term limits are the only way to ensure meaningful change of our @entity9			1
but that wo n't be easy			0
to impose congressional term limits , the @entity22 @entity126 must be amended -- just as it was with the 22nd amendment , which set a term limit for our president			2
the problem is that absent a constitutional convention , the only way to start the process for a constitutional amendment is that @entity9 -- the people with a 9 % approval rating -- have to pass it by a two - thirds vote in each chamber before it can be sent for the required approval by three - fourths of the state legislatures			2
good luck getting @entity9 to agree on that			0
our best and most practical hope is asking candidates running for @entity9 to make a personal pledge to limits of two terms in the @entity17 and three in the @entity16			1
@entity9 , though , still has a chance to atone for its mistakes			0
it 's like at the end of the holiday classic , " the @entity158 " when @entity159 awoke on christmas morning , and after realizing he still had a chance to redeem himself , joyfully declared : " i have n't missed it			0
" well , @entity9 , you have almost missed it			0
while we do n't have three ghosts to warn you , we do have hundreds of millions of @entity22 sending you a message : stop the political posturing , make a deficit reduction deal and then work together to revive our nation 's economy			1
if not , there are numerous locksmiths in the @entity173 area who promise that they can change locks within 15 minutes			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity178 .			0

@entity9 looks unlikely to reach a deficit reduction deal by deadline
@entity178 : follow @entity8 owners ' example and lock out members of @entity9
the only way to force *dramatic* change is to limit congressional terms , he says
@entity178 : stop political posturing , make a deal and revive nation 's economy
