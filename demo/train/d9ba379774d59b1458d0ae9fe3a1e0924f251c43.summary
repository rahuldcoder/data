-- authorities in @entity2 , @entity3 , worked sunday to evacuate residents as a levee along the @entity6 approached imminent failure after heavy rainfall soaked the @entity9 last week			1
" it could collapse at any time , " said @entity10 , a spokesman for @entity3 's @entity11			1
an alert sent out by @entity15 on sunday urged residents near @entity17 to evacuate immediately ahead of the flooding , which is expected to wash out a main road leading to about 150 residences			1
" emergency vehicles including police , fire and @entity25 will not be able to reach residents , " the statement said			0
by 4 p.m. ( 5 p.m. et ) , it was unclear how many residents remained in their homes , said @entity30 , the deputy director of the county 's emergency management department			0
" anyone in there right now wo n't be able to come out , " she told @entity0			0
a @entity36 shelter was opened at a nearby church to accommodate displaced residents			0
the @entity6 crested sunday at 20.4 feet -- nearly 3.5 feet above flood level , according to the @entity40 , putting major pressure on the 120 - year - old @entity44 - @entity43 levee system			1
officials with the @entity11 have been monitoring the levee all week and working to repair any problem areas , but @entity10 said sunday that " this is one problem we have not been able to contain and it 's getting worse			1
" the levee system , built in the 1890s , was constructed from locally available materials -- mostly sand -- " without any engineering design or adherence to any standards , " @entity11 said in a statement friday			1
" this is a 120 - year - old relic , " @entity10 said			0
" it 's made of sand			0
... a modern levee that our engineers would be familiar with would be constructed of steel and concrete			2
so if it does fail we really quite frankly do n't know the extent and scope of what might happen			0
" the river is expected to begin gradually falling sunday evening before dropping below flood stage by wednesday , the weather service said			2
the levee 's anticipated failure comes after a week of rainfall that dumped as much as 11 inches of rain in parts of @entity3 and neighboring @entity79			1
floodgates along the @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity3 , were opened earlier this week to ease pressure on dams			1
@entity85 showed a torrent of water gushing from the overflowing dam			0
" i have never seen the water rage down like it is , " @entity0 ireporter @entity89 said			0
in @entity93 , @entity79 , authorities called late last week for large scale sandbagging in an effort to protect homes and businesses from the rising @entity98 , according to @entity99			1
and in @entity102 , @entity3 , just north of @entity103 in the central portion of the state , ireporter @entity100 said saturday that the flooding is " starting to get a bit scary			1
we have houses that are flooding in our neighborhood			2
" @entity0 meteorologist @entity111 said sunday that there 's no immediate end in sight to the flooding			2
" even though some of these rivers have crested ... keep in mind that they 're still in flood , so this is going to be a problem for a couple of days , " @entity111 said			0
" many of these rivers are all going to be dumping into the @entity124 which then in turn will rise up and we 'll see some flooding there , maybe in @entity128 and the @entity130 areas later in the week			2
" @entity0 's @entity131 contributed to this report .			0

the aging levee system is under pressure after heavy rainfall last week
as much as 11 inches of rain fell in parts of @entity3 and @entity79
flooding is expected to continue over the next few days
