@entity1 @entity0 , the president of the @entity3 , glowingly praised sen. @entity4 on wednesday , and urged @entity6 politicians to pick sides on labor in his closing remarks at a labor summit on raising wages			1
@entity12 , who also spoke at the summit , is seen by many liberals as the best spokeswoman for their causes			2
although the @entity18 senator has said she is not running for president in 2016 , @entity12 has been followed by presidential speculation for months as liberal groups have started movements to urge @entity12 to run in 2016			1
@entity0 started his remarks by calling @entity12 an " inspiration " who embodies labor 's " highest ideals			1
" " her vision of a @entity30 embodies our highest ideals , " @entity0 said			1
" senator @entity12 is that rare political leader : she shares out values , she really connects with us , she is a genius when it comes to policy , and she is tough as nails when it comes to politics			2
" he continued : " senator @entity12 , thank you			2
you have always been and will always be a remarkable , remarkable champion of working people			1
" despite labor 's power within the @entity6 , @entity0 has shied away from weighing in on 2016 politics			1
his remarks about @entity12 , however , are glowing , especially compared to what the labor leader said about @entity51 , the @entity6 front - runner and former secretary of state , in august 2014			1
" i think that @entity51 did an excellent job as secretary of state			0
i think she is very , very qualified to be president , " @entity0 said at a breakfast with reporters in @entity1			0
" would i say she is the favorite now ? yes			0
but i think anytime anybody believes there is going to be a coronation , that is dangerous for the candidate			0
" last year , the @entity3 came to an agreement with all its members that , according to @entity0 , " no one will endorse [ in 2016 ] until we say all of us are going to endorse			2
" and before doing that , the labor group plans to question all presidential candidates			0
but on wednesday , @entity0 urged @entity6 to take sides on labor ahead of the 2016 presidential election and said that if the party wants labor there on @entity75 , they need to get behind the group 's priorities			1
" we know that no matter what happens in the 2014 mid-term elections , 2015 would be a pivotal year , " the labor leader said			0
" it would be the year that politicians decided to stand up strong , or to retreat , afraid of responsibility			0
to be very , very clear about what we need , or to be murky , saying a little of this , a little of that , and a lot of ' maybe , kind of , sort of			0
' to build our nation 's future , or to protect their own backside with caution and corporate cash			0
" the @entity3 will also step up their 2016 activity this year by taking their @entity30 summit message to the first four presidential primary states - @entity99 , @entity100 , @entity101 and @entity102			0
though @entity0 did not mention @entity104 by name , liberal activists could see 2016 implication in the labor leader 's remarks			1
" @entity0 's comments appear to reflect the yearning of so many @entity113 , who long not just for more leaders like @entity4 specifically but in general , leaders who stand up for working people and not just for powerful monied interests , " said @entity109 , a liberal activist and @entity2 contributor			1
" @entity119 implicitly endorsing @entity12 ? i do n't know , but what i think he is explicitly endorsing is more principled , populist leaders like her â€” including in the 2016 presidential race			1
" wednesday 's meeting is the first @entity3 summit on raising wages in the @entity113			0
labor organizations and @entity6 politicians used much of 2014 to push raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10			2
republicans thwarted the law in @entity132 , but voters in reliably red @entity134 , @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 gave labor leaders hope when they voted to approve ballot measures to increase their minimum wages			0
@entity0 pressed those priorities on wednesday , urging the labor leaders assembled to use their " collective voice " to " protect workers ' full rights to engage in collective bargaining and hold employers accountable for violations for these rights			2

@entity0 *heralds* sen. @entity4 as an " inspiration " who embodies labor 's " highest ideals " on wednesday
@entity0 to @entity12 : " you have always been and will always be a remarkable champion of working people "
@entity0 urged @entity6 to take sides on labor ahead of the 2016 presidential election
