@entity1 a little more than a year ago , it quickly became frustratingly obvious that officials in @entity4 were underprepared and overwhelmed by a winter storm			1
about two weeks later , @entity6 had similar travel issues when a storm moved through the state , rapidly dumping snow and making roads in @entity12 and other cities impassable before people could drive back to the house			1
this time , authorities in those states say they are ready			2
there are more snow plows , more trucks to spread brine and authorities are staying ahead of the bad weather			1
and people are staying home or leaving work early			2
a late - season system threatens to scrape @entity1 with the kind of frozen precipitation that even in small amounts can turn a 45 - minute commute into one lasting hours			2
@entity12 and @entity31 face a snowy night			2
@entity6 's capital might get 5 to 9 inches , and as many as 12 inches could fall in the @entity33 , though between 5 and 8 is more likely , according to the @entity34			0
the storm may drop snow in almost every one of @entity6 's 100 counties			1
the good news is it is a fast - moving storm and should be gone by thursday morning			1
yeah , we hear you , @entity42			0
does n't sound like much of a storm , does it ? remember we 're talking about an area of the country where many people do n't even carry an ice scraper in their car			1
what might pass for a light dusting in @entity52 or @entity53 can paralyze a city like @entity1			0
just over a year ago , a few inches of snow and ice left the city in gridlock			1
parents scurried from work and hurried to the suburbs to get schoolchildren home			0
in some cases , @entity64 or @entity65 did n't arrive at home until the next afternoon			0
state and local officials were heavily criticized for their response to the january 2014 storm that created a traffic nightmare and left some motorists stranded for 18 hours or more			1
never again , officials vowed			2
and they 're leaving nothing to chance			0
@entity4 gov. @entity77 ordered state of emergency for 51 northern counties			0
@entity77 said he was very confident there would be no repeat of clogged freeways			0
@entity83 of the @entity84 said roads from @entity1 to @entity86 and @entity87 had been pre-treated			1
the governor of @entity86 -- where 30 weather - related deaths have been reported in the past nine days -- and the governor of @entity87 also declared states of emergency			1
and @entity6 is prepared to do the same			0
a small child died in @entity95			1
@entity96 with the @entity97 said the 2 - year - old girl died in an auto accident after a car hydroplaned			1
several @entity95 counties and cities issued curfews			1
@entity104 , emergency management director for @entity105 , said the storm began as sleet and ice , then turned to snow			1
" we 've had a lot of accidents here , " he said			0
he said the county curfew would be lifted at 5 a.m. there also were restrictions in @entity116 and in @entity117 , @entity118 and @entity119			0
@entity12 hopes to avoid a repeat of last year when just after the @entity1 snowbacle , the city had one of its own as drivers left work seemingly all at the same time			0
on wednesday afternoon , most of the roads around the @entity129 were still clear , and temperatures were in the 40s			0
@entity132 began falling just before 8 p.m. eleven states had winter storm warnings in effect wednesday , reason enough for schools across the region to shut down and bread and milk aisles to get stripped bare			1
the storm 's path goes in a line from @entity144 to the @entity6 coast , though its impact wo n't necessarily be even -- with a few miles here and there potentially meaning the difference between a soaking rain and a @entity151 or something in between			1
take @entity86 , for instance , where @entity154 and @entity155 are forecast to get 1 to 2 inches of snow			2
then there 's @entity158 , in the southeastern corner of the state , which can expect 3 to 7 inches			0
@entity132 is n't the only worry for the @entity162			0
@entity163 and even rain can sometimes be just as debilitating , as previous storms have proven			2
" you never get accustomed to an ice storm , " @entity2 meteorologist @entity166 said			1
" there 's nothing you can do in an ice storm when it really rains on ground that 's ( below freezing )			1
you ca n't drive on it , it 's hard to walk , maneuvering is impossible			0
" in @entity87 , @entity179 found that out the way you do n't want to			1
he and some friends thought it would be better for them to drive home to @entity185 , @entity186 , instead of worrying with canceled flights			0
they did n't make it far			0
they were stuck on @entity191 about 30 miles north of @entity192			2
@entity179 says a hill and snow - covered roadways led to backed - up traffic for miles			1
those planning to fly in and out of the @entity162 are on call in preparation for canceled flights or on the phone to reschedule because that 's already happened			0
as of 9 p.m. , the air travel tracking website @entity203 was already reporting more than 1,540 cancellations wednesday in and out of the @entity205 ( not every cancellation was weather - related )			1
its list of the most - affected airports has a distinctly @entity211 twang , with two around @entity212 ( @entity213 and @entity214 , which were in the middle of the wintry muck in the morning ) among those hardest hit			2
@entity1 's @entity218 led every place with a reported more than 20 % of its arriving and departing flights called off , something that could have far - reaching implications , given its standing as the one of the world 's busiest airports			2
some snow and travel headaches are nothing new , of course , for those in the @entity6 -- especially this winter			2
folks there found plenty of humor in the @entity162 's predicament			0
" in @entity235 , we call this ' wednesday , ' " joked @entity234			0
@entity2 's @entity237 , @entity238 , @entity239 and @entity240 contributed to this report .			0
