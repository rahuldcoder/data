-- you know it will happen someday : zombies are chasing you down the street , groaning for your blood			2
you 've been holed up for a week , and there 's spotty cell service			2
it sure would be handy to request an emergency ammo drop from the black - helicopter guys			1
no ? ok , maybe there 's a major blizzard			2
the power in your part of town goes out for days			2
your landline is knocked out too			2
but there 's still a faint cell signal from a couple of miles away			2
it would be no trouble to traverse that distance if there were n't eight feet of snow piled outside your door			2
you 're running out of food and firewood			2
how do you call for a rescue ? so maybe the zombie apocalypse thing is a wee bit unlikely			1
but for emergencies , it still helps to have a simple , small , hardy backup phone that can make calls , send or receive text messages , and hold a charge for a very , very long time			1
yes , wireless networks often go down during disasters , but they also can come back online ( at least in spots ) before power has been restored to buildings			2
or sometimes , voice service goes down , but text messages will still work			0
( during @entity46 , text messaging saved lives and was a key coordination tool for @entity49 , according to @entity50			0
) or sometimes , wireless carriers or emergency personnel can set up temporary emergency cell towers within a few days			0
but the battery on your regular cell phone may not hold a charge that long			1
so your nasty neighbor who wo n't share his drinking water might be chatting away to his daughter in @entity61 while you 're kicking yourself for not powering down your phone two days before			1
a low - end , energy - efficient backup phone also can come in handy during smaller - scale emergencies -- if your car breaks down or if you just ca n't find your regular phone anywhere			1
on the august 14 @entity69 podcast ( time stamp 50:35 ) , co-host @entity70 ( aka @entity71 ) recommends the @entity72 as her preferred " zombie apocalypse survival phone			1
" this handset was designed primarily for users in the developing world , where access to cell signals and electricity can be very unreliable			0
it 's available in the @entity82 from many online retailers , in the $ 20 to $ 25 price range for an unlocked version -- one that operates on multiple wireless networks			0
this makes it an affordable part of anyone 's emergency preparedness kit			0
@entity70 's co-host @entity93 advised @entity69 podcast listeners , " instead of spending $ 20 on a pizza tonight , go buy this phone			1
" @entity97 noted , " it 's very refreshing to have a phone in your car that can only do three things : make calls , do text messages and set alarms			1
that 's it ! and the text messages are all lower case			0
" the @entity72 is a very thin ( about 9mm thick ) candy bar - style phone with a small e-ink display -- a technology with extremely low power requirements , since it mostly draws power only when the screen changes			1
the handset weighs just 68 grams ( 2.4 ounces )			0
the charger is also very small			1
@entity70 especially likes this phone 's voice - prompting feature : " when you plug in a sim card , it tells you to pick from three languages			1
when you pick a language , it asks you whether you 'd like voice prompting			0
you should say yes , because then , for pretty much everything you do , you 'll get walked through by voice			0
that 's helpful because this visual interface is very minimal			0
the segmented oled display is mainly just icons baked into the e-ink , hard to interpret			0
" according to @entity70 , the phone 's lithium ion battery " lasts for a month or more on standby , with something like 200 hours of talk time			1
" a 2007 @entity137 review of this phone reported the battery life as about two weeks			1
neither estimate had been confirmed			0
@entity97 was planning to take her " zombie apocalypse " phone to the @entity144 gathering ( august 30 - september 6 in the @entity146 desert )			1
while there 's no official cell service in remote @entity150 , some attendees may set up ad - hoc wireless networks			1
( last year , a cell tower installed on private land near the festival proved highly controversial			0
) @entity70 tweets at @entity156 , and you can tweet via text message , so it 's possible she may tweet from @entity144 via her @entity161			0
also , she plans to blog about her zombie apocalypse phone when she returns			1
whichever phone you choose as your emergency backup , get it ready to go			1
put a sim card in it -- and if prepaid , top it off with enough credit to cover lots of talking and texting			0
when you first charge it , condition the battery by letting it drain completely , then recharge it completely			0
make sure you top off the charge at least weekly			0
store the phone with its charger in an easily accessible place , and maybe put some reflective tape on it so you can find it better with a flashlight			1
consult local , state and federal emergency preparedness agencies to find out which numbers you should program into the phone , for both calls and texting			2
also , program in numbers for your family communication plan			0
and of course , program in the numbers of your zombie apocalypse phone tree			1
better to give them a head start early than a head shot later .			0

a low - end , energy - efficient backup phone can come in handy during emergencies
*expert* says @entity72 is her preferred " zombie apocalypse survival phone "
store the phone with its charger in an easily accessible place , or maybe in your car
