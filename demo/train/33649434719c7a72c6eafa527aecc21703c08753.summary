-- back in july 1969 , i stood on the talcum - like lunar dust just a few feet from our home away from home , @entity6 , the lunar module that transported @entity8 and me to the bleak , crater - pocked moonscape			1
standing there and soaking in the view , i called it as i saw it : " magnificent desolation			2
" as @entity8 and i walked upon the surface of the moon at @entity17 , we satisfied a vision held by humankind for centuries			1
and as inscribed on the plaque fastened to the ladder of our lander : " @entity24			0
" sunday will mark the 45th anniversary of the lunar landing , when @entity8 announced , " @entity17 here			0
" it was , truly , one small step , but more steps are needed to fuel and assure @entity30 's leadership role in deep space exploration			1
i 'm often asked just how lonely it was on the moon			1
first of all , what got us there was the tireless effort of some 400,000 people who shared a universal dream			1
@entity41 was a unified enterprise that relied on teamwork			0
second , while we were farther away from terra firma than any humans had ever ventured -- with our colleague @entity45 circling the moon in the command module above us -- the three of us were connected to home planet earth			2
close to a billion people watched and listened to our journey			0
in reflecting back on that thrilling , transformative time , several things come to mind			0
standing on that harsh , desolate , yet magnificent terrain , stealing precious moments , i looked back at @entity57			0
everything i knew and loved lay suspended on a far away and fragile blue sphere that was engulfed by the blackness of space			1
in the back of my mind were @entity8 's words about a step on the moon			1
imagine the great magnificence of humanity going from horse and buggy , to railroads , cars , and airplanes , to rockets -- and now walking on the moon			2
that is a testimonial to the progress of the creatures here on @entity57			0
i could n't have imagined anything more desolate -- knowing it had n't changed in hundreds of thousands of years			2
you could n't find any place like that on @entity57			0
brilliant sunlight illuminated the dust , which was everywhere			2
and the horizon , visibly curving away in the distance , was so clear because no pollution obscured it			0
walking across that landscape was much easier than we had thought it would be			0
when my boot struck moon dust , it flew away in a straight line , a sign of the lighter gravity load , one - sixth that of @entity57			1
i did n't anticipate , returning to @entity57 , that @entity30 's triumph was viewed as a success for all humankind			1
people expressed their collective pride by declaring " we did it ! " -- there was an aura of ownership of the achievement			0
although we can revel in taking rear - view mirror looks at the @entity115 mission , the urgent need , i believe , is to confront the future			2
our space program should not focus on getting back to the moon			2
we have already blazed that trail			0
@entity41 was part of a clear , get - there - in - a - hurry , space race strategy			2
to be blunt , that meant we did n't spend time developing re-usability			0
it 's time for commercial and international interests to move , beyond discovery , to development			1
other nations , @entity132 in particular , are working toward the exploration and development of the moon with robots and , eventually , crews			2
providing @entity30 support for international lunar development is in our best interest			1
by participating in a unified , international effort , we avoid an unnecessary race back to the moon and can still participate in lunar science			1
other @entity30 government entities -- the @entity145 and commercial entities -- should take over in moon exploitation and development			1
it may well be that @entity150 is not best suited to run this program			0
exploitation has never been its strong point			0
it 's true , multiple choices need to be made			2
we could as a country sit around and do nothing			0
on the other hand , we could accept the role of space leadership that we carved out for ourselves in the 1960s and 1970s			0
for @entity30 , another destination is calling			1
@entity30 's longer - term goal should be permanent human presence on @entity165			1
the moment to begin could be on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of @entity115 's touchdown on the moon			1
we can make a courageous , kennedyesque commitment to @entity30 's future in deep space			1
the @entity30 president could utter these momentous words : " i believe this nation should commit itself , within two decades , to commencing an @entity30 - led , permanent presence on the planet @entity165			1
" we must look to re-establish realistic , but ambitious , longer range and more meaningful exploration goals , and we must issue a call -- with the right guidance and sustained funding -- to a new generation			0
the next generation of space explorers			0
again , the @entity187 provided one small step			0
other steps lay ahead , strides that take us to the surface of @entity165			1
catching the summer of supermoons scientists create a mini @entity165 on @entity57 looking up at mesmerizing stars			1

*astronaut* @entity196 stood on the talcum - like dust of the moon 45 years *ago*
he says all he loved lay on a *faraway* , fragile blue sphere engulfed by blackness
@entity196 : let 's join an international *private* - *public* sector effort to develop the moon
but for @entity30 , he says , we must *pursue* permanent human presence on @entity165
