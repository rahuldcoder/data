@entity0 , @entity1 -- president @entity3 placed the blame for @entity6 's current political paralysis squarely at the feet of his @entity9 opponents tuesday , telling @entity2 that the @entity9 's " ideological rigidity " is standing in the way of compromises necessary for stronger economic growth			1
in a wide - ranging interview with @entity16 , the president said the inability of @entity9 leaders in @entity19 to support a recent $ 4 trillion deficit reduction deal focused more heavily on spending cuts than revenue increases is evidence of a party placing political considerations before national interests			1
@entity27 want to see " democrats and @entity9 putting country before party , " he said			2
" the fact that speaker ( john ) @entity32 and folks in his caucus could n't say yes to that ( deficit deal ) tells me that they 're more interested in the politics ... than they are in solving the problem			2
" @entity3 's interview on the campus of @entity44 was conducted in the midst of a three - day presidential swing through the politically pivotal @entity47 , a region believed to be critical in determining the outcome of the 2012 campaign			1
the discussion touched on a host of domestic and international topics , though the president noted the importance of the fragile economy heading into next year 's election			1
" ultimately , the buck stops with me			0
i 'm going to be accountable , " @entity3 said			1
but the president was quick to emphasize the " mess " he inherited from former president @entity60 in 2009			0
he also stressed the economic drag created by state and local government layoffs , as well as " headwinds " from @entity69 's debt crisis , a tsunami - ravaged @entity64 and higher gas prices resulting from the @entity66			2
" we 've made progress since the start of this recession back in 2008			0
( but ) it has n't been fast enough			0
we 've got to accelerate it , " @entity3 said			2
the president stressed that he is " going to need a partner " in @entity19 -- now partially controlled by the @entity9 -- in order to pass legislation needed to strengthen the economy in the short term			1
@entity3 renewed his call for an extension of payroll tax cuts as well as some business tax breaks			2
he also urged @entity19 to pass stalled trade deals with @entity87 , @entity88 and @entity89			0
he noted his intention to unveil new job growth legislation for senators and representatives to consider once they return from their summer recess after @entity95			0
" i 'm going to make my best case for where we need to go " as a country and make " one more run at @entity19 , " he said			0
the president was largely dismissive of the @entity9 presidential field , claiming he was not thinking about it too much at the moment			1
" i 'll let ( the @entity9 ) winnow it down a little bit , " he said			1
but once the @entity9 chooses a presidential standard - bearer for 2012 , " i 'll be ready for them , " the president promised			1
asked to respond to @entity112 gov. @entity111 's assertion that members of the armed services would prefer a commander in chief who has served in the military , @entity3 said presidential candidates have " got to be a little more careful " about what they say			1
but as @entity111 had just entered the race over the weekend , @entity3 said , he will " cut ( @entity111 ) some slack " for the moment			1
regarding former @entity125 gov. @entity124 's remarks that " corporations are people , " @entity3 conceded that corporations play a critical role in the generation of wealth			1
he stressed his disagreement with some conservatives , however , over the closure of tax loopholes benefiting certain major corporations			0
" if you tell me that corporations are vital to @entity27 life , that the free - enterprise system has been the greatest wealth creator we 've ever seen ... that i absolutely agree with , " @entity3 said			1
but " if , on the other hand , you tell me that every corporate tax break that 's out there is somehow good for ordinary @entity27 ... then that i disagree with			0
" @entity124 and @entity111 are considered by most political analysts to be leading contenders for the @entity9 presidential nomination			1
the president also dismissed growing @entity9 calls for a balanced budget amendment to the @entity152 , arguing that such a dramatic change should n't be necessary to put @entity27 's fiscal house in order			1
" we do n't need to amend our constitution in order to do that , " @entity3 said			2
" why ca n't @entity19 simply make good choices ? " the president stressed that the federal government often needs to run deficits in cases of war or recession , partly in order to help state and local governments that are now required to keep their budgets in balance			0
while admitting that politically popular entitlement programs such as @entity174 are contributing to @entity6 's spiraling deficits , @entity3 refused to offer details about what he is willing to do to help control medical costs			1
he stressed the need to lower health care costs as a whole , as opposed to going along with @entity9 attempts to " voucherize " @entity174 and leave more responsibility for health expenses in the hands of vulnerable seniors			2
turning his attention to national security , the president said federal officials are remaining vigilant as the country approaches the 10th anniversary of the september 11 terrorist attacks			0
" the risk is always there , " he said in response to a question about the prospect of an attack launched as revenge for the killing of @entity200 leader @entity199			0
@entity3 said the greatest threat at the moment is a potential " lone wolf " terror attack from a single individual , similar to what recently occurred in @entity208			1
but " as president of the @entity27 , i worry about all of it , " he said			0
shortly before his sit - down interview with @entity2 , @entity3 talked about the best and worst parts of being president -- a position he called the " greatest job on @entity218			1
" he said the best part is hearing from regular people about how policies he has put in place have improved their lives			0
the worst part , @entity3 said , is when he talks to a family member of a fallen soldier			2
" you 're reminded of the incredible sacrifices that people are making for our country			0
and then when you see sometimes our politics not living up to that level of commitment and patriotism that we see from our troops , that gets a little bit frustrating , " he said			0
the president wrapped up his regular interview by noting that if he is re-elected in 2012 , his gift to daughters @entity240 and @entity241 will be " a continuation of @entity245 so that when boys want to start dating them , they are going to be surrounded by men with guns			0
" when he was elected in 2008 , @entity3 told his daughters he would get them a puppy -- a promise that was eventually fulfilled			2
@entity2 's @entity253 contributed to this report .			0
