-- the @entity2 family film update , " @entity1 , " won the weekend box office in fine fashion , grossing $ 25 million according to sunday 's estimates from @entity6			1
" @entity1 " won the weekend box office in fine fashion , grossing $ 25 million			1
that 's the second best opening ever for a movie fronted by @entity9 alone , trailing only the first feature that starred the artist formerly known as @entity9 , " @entity12 , " which banked $ 36.1 million in its 2002 debut			1
" @entity1 's " take was in line with expectations and garnered an okay @entity17 grade of @entity18 from an audience that was 60 percent female			0
it should stay strong at the box office at least until " @entity24 " opens in two weeks			2
also in " @entity1 's " favor : weak competition from reigning champ " @entity27 " ( no. 2 ) , which dropped a hefty 67 percent from its big opening last weekend to gross $ 18.1 million			1
@entity31 's adaptation of @entity33 's landmark superhero saga is clearly slowing down , although it has grossed $ 86 million in 10 days			2
freshman fright flick " @entity36 " was next at no. 3 , with an anticipated $ 14.7 million			1
that 's a decent sum for a horror movie that had the added benefit of opening on " friday the 13th ; " indeed , it 's in line with what most scary remakes tend to bring in on their first weekends			0
thus , you can expect this film ( which got a so - so @entity17 review ) to fall off the map after this frame , since that 's also what most horror movies do			0
" taken " ( no. 4 with $ 6.7 million ) remained in the top five well into its second month at the multiplex			2
@entity58 's " @entity57 " came in at no. 5 with $ 5.1 million			0
and the weekend 's other new wide release , the @entity59 " miss march , " grossed an unsexy $ 2.3 million way down at no. 10			2
meanwhile , the limited indie release " @entity65 , " starring @entity63 and @entity64 , scored the highest opening - weekend per - theater average thus far in 2009 , dusting up a stellar average of $ 53,500 in four theaters in @entity69 and @entity70			0
overall , the box office was a little on the sluggish side , dropping nearly 17 percent from the same frame a year ago , when " dr. @entity76 " was the big winner			1
still , this is just the first " down " weekend in more than a month , which is comforting			0
