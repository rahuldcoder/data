@entity0 finished the @entity2 @entity1 caucuses 34 votes ahead of @entity4 , but results from several precincts are missing and the full actual results may never be known , according to a final certified tally released thursday by the @entity8			1
the new numbers show 29,839 votes for @entity0 and 29,805 votes for @entity4 , according to the party			1
the initial returns from @entity2 gave @entity4 a razor - thin eight - vote margin of victory over @entity0 , reinforcing the former @entity18 governor 's frontrunner status and giving him a major momentum boost heading into the @entity21 primaries			1
@entity4 went on to win @entity21 easily , seemingly making him the first non-incumbent @entity1 in modern history to win the first two contests of the cycle			2
now history is being rewritten , casting a shadow over the first - in - the - nation caucuses and potentially shaking up the @entity8 race two days before the critical @entity30 primary			2
@entity0 said on @entity33 's " @entity31 with @entity32 " that the victory , while delayed , was sweet			2
" we feel very , very good that we not only won , but that we ...			0
pulled off a huge upset , " the former @entity37 senator said in the interview to be broadcast later thursday			0
@entity4 called @entity0 after the revised result came out , according to both campaigns			1
however , they differed on whether @entity4 called to concede , as claimed by @entity0 spokesman @entity43			1
a top @entity4 staffer disputed that any concession occurred , while campaign spokeswoman @entity46 said : " gov. @entity4 called sen. @entity0 to congratulate him on the @entity2 results			1
" in the @entity33 interview , @entity0 said he got an e-mail before 5 a.m. thursday informing him of his 34 - vote victory in the certified results			1
he also said his margin of victory would be higher if uncertified results from other precincts were included			0
" either way you tally it , we were successful			0
and we feel very good about that , " @entity0 said , adding his campaign is working to " continue that momentum and take it here to @entity30 now and off to @entity62			2
" eventually , he said , the @entity1 presidential race will narrow to a lone conservative contender against the more moderate @entity4			2
asked if he was disappointed that the @entity2 results took so long to certify , possibly denying him momentum in last week 's @entity21 primary , @entity0 said : " i do n't blame @entity2			1
" " if you think about it , it moved from eight votes to 34			2
usually in an election , that kind of change is insignificant , " he said			0
@entity43 earlier told @entity33 that the revised result was " exciting because the narrative for a long time has been that @entity4 was 2 - 0			1
" " that 's not the narrative anymore , " @entity43 said			0
" there have been two states , two different victors			0
" @entity4 's eight - vote win was seen as " a huge victory , " @entity43 said			1
" by that standard , i guess 34 votes is just about a landslide in @entity2			1
" while @entity0 had a slight advantage in the certified tally , results from eight precincts were missing and will never be recovered -- a fact that leaves the question of who actually finished first in the caucuses unanswered			1
" i congratulate sen. @entity0 and gov. @entity4 on a hard - fought effort during the closest contest in caucus history , " @entity8 chairman @entity96 said in a written statement			1
" our goal throughout the certification process was to most accurately reflect and report how @entity104 voted			0
" @entity4 said in a written statement thursday morning that the new results show a " virtual tie " between the two candidates			1
" the results from @entity2 caucus night revealed a virtual tie , " @entity4 said			1
" i would like to thank the @entity8 for their careful attention to the caucus process , and we once again recognize @entity0 for his strong performance in the state			2
" " the @entity2 caucuses , with record turnout , were a great start to defeating president @entity119 in @entity2 and elsewhere in the general election , " @entity4 added			1
one week after @entity2 's january 3 caucuses , @entity4 won the @entity21 primary with nearly 40 % of primary votes			1
in that contest , @entity0 , a former @entity37 senator , finished in fifth place with 9 %			2
the @entity30 primary is scheduled for saturday			0
the @entity30 has picked the winner of every @entity8 nomination fight since 1980			0
@entity4 currently appears to be clinging to a dwindling lead there over former house speaker @entity131			2
a @entity1 debate will be held thursday night in @entity133 , @entity30			0
" the bottom line is , it 's really going to make a boost to our campaign today and remind people just that we 've been able to tackle and take on @entity4 head - on , " @entity43 said			1
" we are the alternative to him , and we plan on taking this into @entity30 and beyond and showing folks that we 've got the message and the messenger that can beat the guy who 's just writing checks , trying to buy a state			0
" @entity43 said he can " understand how the @entity4 campaign is out there trying to marginalize the victory			0
i can understand he does n't want that narrative out there , but it 's a big win for our campaign and we 're really excited about it			0
" @entity33 chief political correspondent @entity155 said she does n't believe the @entity2 development will change the big picture for the prospective nominees			0
" i think it does give @entity0 bragging rights , " she said			0
" any time you can grab the headlines , that 's a good thing			0
" but , she said , the results are not that different from the close margin seen just after the caucuses .			0

@entity0 finishes with a 34 - vote advantage over @entity4 in @entity2
