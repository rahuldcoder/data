-- it 's a cottage industry lately			2
one week we led with @entity0 president @entity3 being relieved of his duties			1
another week it was @entity6 getting the boot for his remarks about @entity9			0
on sunday , we 'll look at @entity11 's decision to ax @entity12 over remarks about @entity14 that he made on @entity15			1
this is not shaping up as a left - right slugfest			2
while @entity18 has practically declared war on @entity11 , many liberals from salon editor @entity21 to @entity0 contributor @entity22 to @entity24 of " @entity25 " criticized the radio network for axing @entity12			1
it did n't help that @entity11 chief executive @entity28 suggested he was seeing a psychiatrist			1
i 've known @entity12 since he was at the @entity32 , and his unpredictable views have a tendency to tick people off			1
he 's an @entity36 who got roasted by the liberal black community for backing @entity39 against @entity41 's allegations			0
the decision to dump @entity12 , in my view , has as much to do with his @entity15 connection as his admission that he gets nervous when he sees people in @entity14 garb on his plane			1
i find those remarks unsettling , but do they constitute a firing offense ? we 'll tackle that question with the @entity54 's @entity53 , @entity56 's @entity55 and commentator @entity57			0
we 'll also discuss the latest tensions between @entity60 candidates and the press			0
i 'll also have a wide - ranging conversation about politics and culture with @entity66 columnist @entity65			0
plus , how did @entity69 land president @entity67 as a guest , and is his upcoming @entity72 rally an appeal to moderation or sheer entertainment ? @entity77 critic @entity76 will join that discussion			0
that 's the lineup -- at least , if no one gets fired between now and sunday morning .			2

@entity83 is the host of @entity0 's " @entity85 " on sundays
@entity11 fired @entity12 after he *admitted* he gets nervous seeing @entity14 on his plane
other high - *profile* *journalists* have been fired recently for *expressing* opinions
@entity83 : decision to dump @entity12 has as much to do with @entity15 connection as *statements*
