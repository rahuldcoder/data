-- the images are all too familiar			0
young protesters , disenfranchised and frustrated , take to the streets to fight a government that is ignoring their demands			0
at first peaceful , the protests are met with the heavy hand of riot police			0
photographs of resilient demonstrators -- some standing obstinate amid the clouds of tear gas , others covered in pepper spray -- flood the @entity15			0
but what is surprising about this week 's images is that they come from @entity18 , one of @entity21 's financial hubs and a territory known for its stability			1
the impetus for these pro-democracy protests , started by a student boycott of classes and joined by the group @entity28 with @entity29 and @entity30 , was the @entity33 government 's pronouncement that the selection of candidates in @entity18 's election in 2017 would be limited by a @entity38 committee , a move that would ostensibly prevent a leader resistant to @entity42 's influence from coming to power			1
such an arrangement follows the letter of the @entity46 , which codified the policy of " one country , two systems , " as well as a 2007 decree by the @entity51 that promised universal suffrage in 2017 , but hardly their spirit			0
it is therefore no surprise that the signs have long seemed to point to an eventual clash of perspective			0
@entity18 was returned to mainland @entity61 from the @entity62 in 1997 , its institutions grounded in @entity64 and democratic thought			1
@entity18 's economic freedoms and openness draws in companies and individuals from around the globe , further perpetuating the territory 's ties to the outside world			1
on the other side of the coin is @entity42 , well known for its opposition to the open flow of information and the @entity64 concept of democracy			0
@entity18 protests : what you need to know both sides have demonstrated restraint , with the protesters remaining largely peaceful and the government pulling back riot police after a day of aggressive crowd control tactics			1
moreover , it is in the interest of both parties to maintain a low level of intensity			0
violent escalation by the @entity28 movement would only justify an equally violent response , and international condemnation and domestic anger would follow hostile action by the police			2
that said , in a meeting with @entity18 's business elite , @entity33 president @entity102 asserted that @entity42 will not yield			1
the @entity33 government is aggressively censoring posts on @entity107 , a popular social media site -- censored posts reportedly increased five-fold over the weekend , and " @entity18 " is now the most widely deleted search term on the social media site -- and @entity111 was blocked for the first time in @entity18			2
in the meantime , the @entity28 movement has already achieved much by bringing greater attention to @entity18 's struggle for democracy			1
as the removal of riot police reveals , the international presence in @entity18 means that @entity42 does not have the same freedom of action as it does on the mainland			1
in @entity61 , demonstrations against issues such as pollution , corruption and forced land seizures are common and under - reported , caught behind the government 's @entity129			1
but it is harder for the world to ignore the comprehensive and detailed reports emanating from @entity18			2
with their actions , the @entity18 citizens are assembling the pieces for greater civil and political participation in not only @entity18 but also mainland @entity61			1
the possible financial ramifications of the @entity28 movement could cause @entity42 to seek a quick conclusion to the demonstrations			2
after all , with traffic bottlenecked by protesters , business as usual in one of @entity21 's financial hubs and @entity61 's financial center is in question			1
a number of banks reportedly temporarily closed some of their branches and asked employees to work from home			0
investors , too , are waiting to see the outcome of the protests in @entity18 before continuing projects			2
should the demonstrations linger , @entity42 might therefore need to reassess its tactics -- though this could result in an even more aggressive crackdown			0
the road ahead will not be easy			0
@entity102 and the @entity165 are unlikely to shift from the short - term tactic of censorship and suppression			0
the leaders and participants of the @entity28 movement risk arrest and censure in a territory and country that values stability above all			2
but they are carving out a space for civil and political participation throughout @entity61			1
in the end , such participation will improve both @entity61 's governance and the lives of its people			1
now if only @entity42 can get out of its own way			0
from umbrella protests to ' umbrella revolution '			0
