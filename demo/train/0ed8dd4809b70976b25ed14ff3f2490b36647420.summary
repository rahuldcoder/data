clashes continued to rage on the sixth day of what appears to be a coordinated offensive by @entity4 rebels to push a hard - line @entity6 militia out of northern @entity4			1
" they 're shooting back and forth , " said @entity8 , a resident of the @entity10 border town of @entity11			0
gunfire echoed over the receiver as he spoke to @entity15 by phone wednesday			0
@entity8 said he could see and hear fighting across the border in the nearby @entity4 town of @entity19 , which has been controlled for months by the @entity6 - linked militant group called the @entity21 , or @entity21			1
@entity19 is one of many towns across a swath of opposition - controlled northern @entity4 where rebels have attacked @entity21 positions in recent days			1
the deadly power struggle marks a dramatic shift in the @entity4 civil war , as many opposition fighters have turned from battling the forces of @entity4 strongman @entity32 to attacking their own former comrades in arms			1
rebel spokesmen said that @entity21 's violent enforcement of a plan to establish an @entity21 state in @entity4 had alienated other opposition groups			1
" they ( @entity21 ) have become aggressive , and they have crossed the red line from trespassing to assaults to their extremist agenda , " said @entity40 , a spokesman for a rebel umbrella group that calls itself the @entity42			2
in an interview with @entity15 on tuesday , @entity40 said @entity21 's radical interpretation of @entity49 law , public executions and imprisonment of opponents were key factors that spurred the opposition to take up arms against the @entity6 - linked group			1
" @entity21 can not withstand the losses they are taking and the numbers now held as prisoners of war , " @entity40 said , saying that his organization far outnumbered @entity21			0
the @entity42 boasts an estimated 40,000 fighters , making it probably the single largest rebel command , according to @entity64 , editor of the @entity65 's @entity4 in crisis website			2
chaotic fighting fighters on both sides appear to have committed atrocities			1
according to the @entity73 - based @entity72 , rebels summarily executed at least 34 @entity21 militants near the town of @entity76 this week			1
meanwhile , rebels posted videos and photos of the bodies of at least nine men who they said had been executed after being kidnapped by @entity21			0
the graphic images , which were said to be filmed in the battlefield city of @entity84 , showed the men apparently shot through the head			0
each victim 's hands appeared to be bound from behind with plastic cuffs			0
@entity15 could not verify the authenticity of the photos and video			0
the chaotic war within a war that erupted over the last week in northern @entity4 is further complicated by the fact that the @entity97 faction includes another militia tied to the @entity6 terror network			2
militants from the @entity101 , which follows a hardline @entity103 ideology inspired by @entity6 , have joined in the battle against @entity21 in recent days			2
on tuesday , @entity106 's leader called for an end to the bloody infighting , which is believed to have left hundreds of people dead			0
in a nine - minute audio message , @entity111 - @entity110 blamed " the incorrect policies " of @entity21 for " aggravating the conflict " between armed opposition factions			2
