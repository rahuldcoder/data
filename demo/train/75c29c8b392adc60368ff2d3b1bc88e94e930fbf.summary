-- since everything about @entity2 is fortissimo — including but not limited to its unabashed pursuit of awards that are shiny or globular or both — you have perhaps already heard a little about the movie now storming the @entity9 of your wallet			0
you may already know that to make his movie adaptation of the internationally popular theatrical musical conjured from the 19th - century political novel by @entity18 , director @entity19 ( @entity20 ) bade his actors sing live during filming			1
you probably already know that @entity25 , as the wretched single mother - turned - prostitute @entity23 , is reputedly a formidable @entity27 favorite for her sobbing and warbling and haircutting - in - real - time			1
you 've learned , from posters and trailers , that @entity34 , as former convict @entity32 , looks impressively stricken and that @entity36 , as implacable police inspector @entity35 , looks disconcertingly dyspeptic			1
what 's left to learn is this : @entity2 provides compelling reasons for @entity36 to be peeved , beginning with the humiliation of having to sing @entity41 - style , when it clearly is so not his thing , and ending with the @entity46 wardrobe into which the gentleman is packed			1
( o , for @entity36 's costumed glory days in @entity49 ! ) @entity34 has a right to be cranky too , although he 's too much of a trouper to show it as he overemotes on demand and sings of finding @entity55 after he steals a pair of candlesticks from a nice priest			1
) @entity25 looks happy enough channeling @entity61 for her tremulous rendition of the @entity64 - appropriated anthem '' @entity65 , '' but that 's no doubt because she knows that soon after the song , she 's pretty much done for the night			1
shall i go on about all the ways in which this fake - opulent @entity2 made me long for guillotines while millions of viewers who have softer , more generous hearts than i may swoon with money 's - worth contentment ? ( at least it does n't skimp on length : the movie is approximately as long as the 1832 @entity79 uprising it depicts			2
) @entity81 and @entity82 mug and prance as the comic - relief grifters thénardier and his missus , outfitted in what has become de rigueur for both @entity86 — @entity88 makeup and prosthetically grungy teeth			2
@entity90 and @entity91 play the young lovers @entity101 ( @entity23 's muppet daughter , raised by @entity32 ) and the boy - band - styled student revolutionary @entity95 like lab rats , their pale faces and lashless eyelids often observed in the merciless close - up that is one of @entity19 's mix - it - up signature shots			2
( he is similarly devoted to tilted perspective and the room - at - a - 45 - degree - angle shot			0
) it 's a daunting challenge , to be sure , to turn a big musical into a viable movie			0
for every great cabaret , @entity108 , and @entity109 , there 's a dud @entity113 , @entity114 , and @entity112 ! but this steam - driven military weapon of an enterprise is a sobering reminder of just how tinny a musical @entity2 was in the first place — the listless music and lyrics by @entity121 , @entity122 , and @entity123 , the derivative characters fashioned from @entity125 ! scraps			0
and even if you do come to mr. @entity19 's neighborhood loving the show , having seen seven stage productions and named your cat @entity132 after the urchin who hitches his fate to those of grown - up revolutionaries , well , you 're in for a gobsmacking : this '' prestige '' production is at heart a minor road - show carnival , leaving behind little but tinsel as it rumbles through the streets of @entity146			0
