-- a woman known as juror @entity2 thought writing an anonymous book about her experiences on the @entity7 trial was a good idea			1
many people , including a powerful and tireless group of outraged @entity12 users , thought otherwise			2
news reports surfaced monday morning that the woman , who gave an exclusive interview that night with @entity0 's @entity15 about her experiences on the six - woman @entity7 jury , had signed with a literary agent and was working on a book proposal about the trial			1
the agent was identified as @entity22 , who has worked on such other post-trial tomes as @entity24 's " if i did it " and @entity28 's " getting it through my @entity26			2
" then came the @entity12 backlash , led by 29 - year - old @entity30 , who goes by @ @entity31 on @entity12			1
@entity30 saw the juror 's interview on @entity0 and decided to take action			1
" i was angry and i did n't think it was right that someone would make money off of this tragedy -- especially after they let @entity7 go free , " she told @entity35			2
@entity30 tracked down contact information for @entity42 , including her @entity12 handle , e-mail address , mailing address and phone number , and posted it on the social network and on @entity47 , which displays social media posts in a blog - like stream			1
she then asked her followers to write @entity42 and urge her to drop @entity2 as a client			0
next she launched a @entity55 petition with the title , " @entity22 : drop juror @entity2 from @entity58 , " which quickly hit 1,346 signatures			0
immediately , people began venting on @entity12 and contacting @entity42			0
in a matter of hours , @entity42 announced late monday afternoon that she and the juror were no longer moving ahead with the book			1
in a statement released by @entity42 , the juror said , in part , " i have realized the best direction for me to go is away from writing any sort of book and return instead to my life as it was before i was called to sit on this jury			0
" she elaborated in a statement wednesday to @entity0 , saying , " there was an agreement with a literary agent to explore the concept of a book which discussed the impact of sequestration on my perceptions of this serious case , while being compared to the perceptions of an attorney who was closely following the trial from outside the ' bubble			2
' " the relationship with the agent ceased the moment i realized what had been occurring in the world during the weeks of my sequestration , " she said			0
the quick death of the proposed book startled even those familiar with the power of well - orchestrated social media campaigns to sway public opinion and influence business decisions			1
it appears that @entity42 has since deleted her main @entity12 account			0
and monday , the number of @entity30 's @entity12 followers has jumped from 1,600 to more than 9,100			1
a thank - you tweet from @entity107 ' @ questlove probably did n't hurt			0
" i definitely believe in the power of @entity12			0
i 'm in shock , really , about the whole thing , " @entity30 told @entity110			0
" i 'm glad that people did n't brush it off and just say , ' oh , it 's just @entity12 , and ... nothing will come of this			2

a juror from the @entity7 trial announced monday she would write a book
one angry @entity12 user led a campaign against the book deal

by that night the proposed book deal had fallen apart
