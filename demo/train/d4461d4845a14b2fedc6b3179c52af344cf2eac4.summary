media mogul @entity0 , the tweet fittingly declared , " goes from tabloid boss to tabloid prey			1
" that 's because the head of the powerful @entity7 empire has declared his intention to split from his younger wife @entity9 after the news emerged , the news - ravenous @entity10 , gossip - hungry tabloids and every other blog started soaking up the latest celebrity divorce			1
inquiring minds are dying to know why this power pair are getting unhitched			0
the rumor mill is grinding and the whiff of scandal and the hint of sleaze beckon			0
people who 've got the answers are n't tattling			0
the @entity25 said the reasons are " allegedly shocking			0
" its headline shouted -- " ' @entity28 - dropping ' ! " for now , people are having fun poking fun			0
one blogger quipped , " @entity9 to divorce @entity0 after he drops from # 98 to # 105 on rich list			1
" another tweet observed that " someone 's # estateplan will be changing ... " @entity0 is 82 and @entity38 is 44 , so the may - december age difference is duly noted : " if @entity38 starts dating a 60 - sumpn billionaire , he 'll still be 20 yrs younger than @entity0			1
" @entity38 made headlines two years ago for forcefully defending @entity0 from a pie - throwing intruder in @entity46 's @entity45			1
that was @entity9 's " greatest moment , " one wit said			2
she 's not just his wife ; she 's his " pie - deflecting " wife			1
" if a woman did karate chops for me , @ rupertmurdoch , i 'd never let her go bro , " one tweeter said			0
another said , " i bet rupert @entity0 wife wishes now she had let that custard pie smack him in the face			1
" the @entity61 - born , @entity60 - educated @entity38 was very accomplished in her own right @entity62 , even though critics jabbed her as a " gold digger " through her marriage to the media mogul			1
her husband runs one of the most powerful media conglomerates in the world -- one that includes @entity72 , @entity73 television ( including @entity74 and fx ) , @entity77 news service , @entity79 publishing and many newspapers including the @entity81 , @entity46 's @entity82 and several publications in his native @entity84			1
but @entity38 had stayed largely out of the public eye until july 2011			2
she was sitting behind @entity0 in @entity45 in @entity87 , while he testified about his company 's involvement in a phone - hacking scandal that rocked @entity46			1
comedian @entity91 came at @entity0 with a shaving - foam pie			1
@entity38 leaped into action , lunging at @entity94 and smashing his hand with her own			2
" mr. @entity0 , " said parliamentarian @entity97 , who minutes earlier had been particularly critical of the media titan , " your wife has a pretty good left hook			2
" social media erupted in response to what soon became known as " the slap heard round the world " and earned her the sobriquet " tiger wife			1
" the reaction was particularly strong on @entity61 microblogs , where many hailed @entity38 's reaction as a moment of pride for @entity116 women			2
@entity0 and @entity38 met at a @entity118 cocktail party shortly after her graduation from @entity60			1
@entity38 then went on to work at @entity121 , a @entity118 - based satellite television service that 's under @entity0 's corporate umbrella			1
in a 2011 interview with his wife on @entity126 , @entity0 recalled her interpreting for him while he toured the @entity61 mainland			2
a fervent pursuit followed , though @entity38 did n't necessarily return all his affection			2
" i fell in love with her , and i asked her			0
she said no , and it took a long time to persuade her , " @entity0 said			2
their 1999 wedding occurred shortly after @entity0 filed for divorce from his second wife , @entity140			1
( @entity140 wed @entity0 in 1967 , the same year he divorced his first wife and one year before @entity38 was born , according to multiple reports			1
) shortly after the wedding , @entity0 announced his new wife would step down from her executive role at a @entity7 subsidiary in @entity118			0
he described her as " busy working on decorating the new apartment			0
" a @entity81 profile , published in 2000 , hinted she did n't entirely leave the business world			0
@entity38 frequently accompanied her husband and stepson to meetings with high - ranking @entity61 officials , where she 'd sometimes intervene " to smooth over potentially awkward situations , " according to that report			1
over the past 12 years , she gave birth to and raised two girls , @entity158 and @entity159			0
( @entity0 has four other children from his two previous marriages , some of whom hold prominent posts at @entity7 ) her @entity60 profile notes she 's a co-founder of @entity166 , an independent studio in @entity87 that makes applications and games for @entity170 operating systems according to its website			0
and in 2011 , she produced , " @entity172 , " a film set in 19th century @entity61 centered on two girls who circumvent cultural restrictions on females			0
a divorce would end her union to @entity0 , and perhaps set up a battle over how much of his fortune -- which @entity182 recently estimated at $ 11.2 billion -- she and her children will receive			2
this potential showdown comes at a tenuous time for @entity7 , which recently approved a plan to split its operations into two publicly traded companies			0
@entity0 , the existing company 's largest shareholder , is set to become chairman of the two new companies			0
it was not immediately known if @entity38 and @entity0 signed a prenuptial agreement prior to their wedding , and if so where they filed it			1
@entity199 , president of the @entity201 chapter of the @entity202 of @entity203 , said he 'd expect they did so in @entity201 -- a state with a tendency to enforce terms of such agreements			0
" @entity201 will apply those terms so long as they are not grossly unfair or unconscionable , " @entity199 said			0
" the same can not be said about every other country in the world			0
" one altruist actually tweeted : " should n't we respect @entity0 's right to privacy during this difficult time ? " good luck with that ! the " tabloid boss " is now " tabloid prey			0

@entity0 and @entity9 married in 1999
