@entity1 , @entity0 -- resourceful @entity4 filmmakers are using cell phones to tell their stories in spite of political censorship			2
art school student @entity9 listens during a mobile phone filmmaking workshop at the @entity11 in @entity12			1
@entity9 , an art school student from the @entity13 is one such director who shot his first film using only a mobile phone			1
the ingeniously devised " @entity22 " ( " @entity23 " ) provides a rare glimpse of street - life in @entity12 , the country 's capital , while highlighting the lengths filmmakers must go to in circumventing the eye of the law			1
while the country 's name implies freedom of speech , filmmakers in the country 's capital are restricted by government censorship			2
to get around these problems , @entity31 came up with a novel plan			2
he attached his mobile phone to a toy car , set it to film , and gave it to a young girl to pull behind her on a piece of string as she walked through the streets of @entity12			1
the film runs for seven minutes , during which time the toy car stops and starts ( it also upends a number of times and has to be righted by @entity31 's young camerawoman ) giving viewers a clandestine look at life in the capital -- the dancing feet of children , some teenagers gambling , and at one point a @entity55 jeep passing by			1
@entity31 is one of a number of filmmakers in @entity13 who say using a mobile phone allows them to film in ways that were previously impossible			1
" camera phones are affordable , small and easy to maneuver , " @entity9 told @entity2			0
" they allowed me to work more discreetly and get closer to my subjects			0
" government officials try to keep reports of poverty and corruption quiet , which means filming permits have become virtually impossible for @entity13 working in @entity12 to obtain , according to filmmakers working there			1
@entity75 , chairman of @entity77 - based @entity4 news organization , @entity74 , which has operated in @entity13 , agrees that it can be very difficult for filmmakers to work in the country			1
" [ they ] try and stop stories of corruption from coming out by refusing accreditation to locals from the @entity85			0
that 's the way they weed out people who will be critical to government , " @entity75 told @entity2			0
those brave enough to defy the authorities and shoot without permission , whether or not they have an anti-government agenda , risk hefty fines , arrest , or worse			0
a spokesperson from the @entity13 government was not available for comment			2
@entity31 only started making films last year , when he participated in a mobile phone filmmaking workshop held by @entity102 filmmaker , @entity103 - @entity101 in february 2008			1
the young @entity13 says it gave him the inspiration he needed to carry on making films			2
" after her course here in @entity12 i fell in love with directing , editing and working in a team , " @entity9 told @entity2			2
watch @entity31 's " @entity22 " here			0
@entity101 organizes mobile filmmaking master classes in deprived regions of the world to give young people in developing countries an opportunity to tell their stories			2
although her @entity13 workshop was officially organized for students at the @entity11 , @entity12 's only arts school , @entity101 also encouraged less privileged youths from nearby slums to attend her tutorials			1
" the pupils who were most interested were coming from the roughest townships in @entity12 , " the 49 - year - old told @entity2			2
" they would spend two and a half hours traveling to the school by foot because they did n't have money for a bus			0
" for me it was very important that they could participate , " she said			0
during the two weeks she spent in @entity12 in 2008 , @entity136 and her trainees produced a total of eight short films -- an impressive tally given the logistical problems they faced			1
" i wanted them to edit what they had shot , but there was little access to computers , " she told @entity2			0
" we also had a lot of electricity problems , " she continued			0
" in @entity12 , you have a period of at least two or three hours a day where you have no electricity			2
" @entity31 's film has been entered into the international section of mobile phone film festival , 5th @entity159 , which is being held in @entity160 in june			1
the festival organizers supported @entity101 's mobile workshops by equipping her with camera phones			1
@entity165 , founder of @entity159 , says the relative cheapness of mobile movies can serve as a stepping stone for emerging cineastes in poorer regions			1
" young filmmakers , knowing that it 's very cheap , often decide to make their first feature film by shooting it on mobile , using it as an advertisement to show what they 're capable of , " @entity165 told @entity2			1
@entity31 's mobile film allowed the young @entity13 to successfully showcase his talents and opened the vital first door to a future in filmmaking			1
he is now working as an assistant director on a documentary about the economy of @entity13 's mining region , @entity186			1
@entity31 also continues to shoot on mobile phones and has , with a number of his workshop colleagues , founded @entity190 , a collective of video artists who show their films in the streets of @entity12			1
@entity101 is pleased that her classes have taken on a momentum of their own			0
" for the artists in the collective , it 's a very important way to express themselves , " she said			0
" we 've been in touch all year by e-mail and i support them , but they 're doing their own thing now			0
" now , she 's seeking a new challenge			0
having just returned from her second workshop in @entity210 , @entity101 is currently planning a third in the slums of @entity212 this september			0
" sometimes i think i must be crazy doing what i do , " she told @entity2			0
" but if it was n't for the workshops i would never get to see these places and meet these interesting people			0
