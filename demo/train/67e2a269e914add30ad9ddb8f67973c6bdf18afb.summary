@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's plan started out simple : take his son on a skateboarding trip to someplace " epic			1
" while he and his son , @entity10 , were searching the internet , they saw videos of @entity1 's skateboarders making do with beaten - up and jerry - rigged boards			1
economic shortages and the @entity17 embargo make it difficult to get most sporting equipment there			1
for skateboarders , it was nearly impossible			0
" we both said right away , ' we are going there , ' " @entity4 recalled			2
@entity25 owns a chain of skateboard shops in @entity28 and thought his contacts in the skating community would make it easy for him to bring boards to @entity1			1
" i e-mailed every single skateboard company i know , " @entity4 said			1
" the only two responses i got were unfortunately one person who said we should n't be allowed to go because of the embargo			0
another ' genius ' said we should n't come because all the skaters are all communist			0
" as a first - generation @entity1 - @entity17 , @entity4 had already been dreaming of visiting the island where his parents where born			1
the recent relaxing of travel restrictions under the @entity46 administration makes visiting easier for @entity47 and for people on cultural exchange trips			0
but he did n't want to go empty - handed			0
a former dj whose arms are crisscrossed with tattoos , @entity25 put out the word that any board , no matter how worn or weathered , would be welcomed by the @entity1			2
slowly , as he and his family got ready for the trip , skateboards began to trickle in			2
" the response from the kids has been amazing , " @entity4 said			2
" it 's easier for a 9 - year - old kid who skates to understand the need than for a 30 - year - old head of a skateboard company , who just does n't get it			2
" a week before the flight to @entity1 , he held a skateboard party for people wishing to donate			1
heavy metal rock played at a skate park in @entity74 's @entity73 neighborhood in the background as dozens of teenagers practiced their moves			0
the boards continued to pile up in front of @entity80			0
" this is really awesome , " he said as the reality of the trip sank in			0
@entity1 skaters like @entity86 rely on generous foreigners like @entity25			1
@entity88 said there are skate parks around the island but no skate shops			0
there is nowhere for skaters to buy their first boards or replace ones that break , he said			2
" sometimes , it holds back your progression , " @entity88 said			0
" you see a set of stairs and you say , ' i am not going to do anything down there because i will break my board			0
i 'd rather keep my board healthy than do that trick i really want do			0
' " @entity88 lives for skating , a point he drives home by showing visitors his wedding video where , after the ceremony , he , his bride and wedding party roar away on skateboards			0
before coming to @entity1 , @entity25 had been trying to get in touch with @entity88 , the closest thing to a leader in @entity0 's skate scene			2
within an hour after landing , @entity4 randomly bumped into @entity88 on the street in a kind of only - in - @entity0 coincidence			1
the two skaters quickly made plans to skate together and distribute the duffel bags full of boards and gear that @entity4 brought with him			1
walking into the skateboard area at @entity0 's @entity130 , @entity25 immediately saw several dozen skaters and realized that he had n't brought enough equipment to go around			1
@entity88 told him not to worry and said they would hold a skate competition			0
as the local skaters flew off ramps and attempted tricks , the @entity17 ' eyes went wide			1
@entity25 ; his wife , @entity140 ; son , @entity10 ; and family friend @entity142 were stunned that the @entity1 skated the way they did with the sorry gear they had			1
" i do n't how that guy uses such small wheels on that board , " @entity4 whispered			2
soon , the contest was over			0
while most of the skaters did n't win boards , they seemed happy with the hats , t - shirts or sunglasses they received			1
the skaters who won boards wore ear - to - ear grins			1
@entity4 says he does n't want to be portrayed as " the gringo coming to the rescue			2
" " the @entity1 skaters have been incredibly generous			1
they keep inviting us to meals and to get together , " he said			0
" i am already thinking of my next trip and all the gear i am going to bring			0

@entity4 is a first - generation @entity1 - @entity17 and skateboard shop owner
he wanted to help @entity1 skaters get better equipment
he reached out to young skateboarders , who donated dozens of old boards
he brought them to @entity1 on a recent trip with his family
