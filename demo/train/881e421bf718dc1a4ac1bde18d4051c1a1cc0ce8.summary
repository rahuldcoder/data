" when i looked at my child i saw a normal , happy , productive child , " @entity12 told @entity14 's @entity13 on " @entity15			1
inside , behind the scenes , there were other things going on with the bullying			2

authorities last week dropped criminal charges against two girls accused of cyberbullying @entity1			0
the civil wrongful death lawsuit has not yet been filed , and @entity25 did not specify the targets of the future legal action			1
in addition , @entity25 's attorney , @entity37 , is pushing @entity2 lawmakers to enact " @entity47 " -- legislation that would allow the state to file bullying charges against minors and their parents , and make parents liable in civil court			1
" for the parent , i think civil responsibility , " @entity37 told @entity15 on tuesday			2
" if parents know they can be held financially responsible for the acts of their children then ultimately that might provide a deterring effect for them to monitor their child 's behavior			1
" @entity1 , 12 , died after jumping from the top of an abandoned concrete plant in september			0
@entity25 said all her efforts to halt the bullying -- including counseling , reporting the harassment to school officials as well as other parents , even removing her daughter from school -- failed to deter the alleged bullies			1
" it just would n't stop , " she said , " no matter what we did to try to eliminate it			0
" @entity25 said the abuse was unrelenting and had nothing to do with her daughter not having " thick skin			1

" i think ( the bullying ) was so much and so often			2
" authorities said @entity1 killed herself after months of cyberbullying from fellow students			0

police said the abuse included messages such as " nobody cares about u , " " i hate u , " and " you seriously deserve to die			0
" @entity1 had already cut open her wrists months before the jump , but survived that suicide attempt			0
