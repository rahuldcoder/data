@entity0 -- for @entity2 , a millennial and a conservative , sen. @entity4 's change of heart on supporting same - sex marriage was a much - needed â € ” albeit tardy turnaround			1
for fellow conservative @entity10 , a baby boomer , the @entity9 @entity8 's switch signals a decided lack of principles			1
the two divergent views illustrate the kind of challenges facing the @entity8 as it undergoes a major makeover after losing the 2012 presidential election			2
the party is trying to figure out how to embrace and capitalize on the youthful energy of young members like @entity2 while not alienating long - standing members like @entity23			0
last year , a poll by the @entity25 found the percentage of @entity27 between 18 and 29 who opposed same - sex marriage dropped to 30 % from 48 % in 2004			1
among those 50 to 64 , the percentage also dropped , but less dramatically -- 78 % to 68 %			0
" slowly , we are seeing a movement among some that identify as conservative that same - sex marriage is going to become a reality down the road , " said @entity32 , professor of public policy and political science at @entity35 and @entity36 and author of " from identity to @entity39 : the @entity46 in the @entity47			1
" " they are realizing that there are other issues that are much more important to them worth fighting , " he said			0
" younger people who consider themselves conservatives just do n't care			2
and these younger conservatives are more concerned with the state of the economy and whether they are going to have a job when they come out of school			0
" @entity61 : one conservative 's dramatic reversal on gay marriage the generational split was especially stark at the @entity66 just outside of @entity0 on friday			2
some younger conservatives like @entity2 warmly greeted the news that after @entity4 's 21 - year - old son , @entity69 , told his parents that he was gay , @entity4 came to the conclusion that same - sex marriage " is something that we should allow people to do			1
" @entity2 said that as a college student , she has a " liberal stance " on the issue			0
" i think it is great for someone to come out and say they are in support of gay marriage			0
... the party kind of needs to be more welcoming and involved , so i think it is a good step			0
" however , many older republicans did n't share @entity2 's sentiments			2
" i think it means that he has no principles , to be honest with you , " said @entity10 , 58			0
" he can support his son and love his son , but you have ( to decide ) something is either right or wrong			0
" nationally , polls have shown growing support for same - sex marriage			1
a recent survey from @entity99 found that 47 % of those polled support same - sex marriage while 43 % oppose it			1
the poll also indicates a wide partisan divide on the issue with @entity105 supporting same - sex marriage at 65 % , independents 50 % and @entity27 23 %			1
same - sex couples can now legally marry in nine states and the @entity0			1
the president and the nation have evolved on same - sex marriage " we 've grown up with gay men and women being out of the closet			1
it 's not as shocking as it is for boomers , " @entity115 , a @entity1 political contributor and conservative commentator said recently			2
" older conservatives recognize that a lot of younger conservatives are more socially liberal			1
" an upcoming , internal report by the @entity123 is expected to point to the wide popularity gap between @entity105 and @entity8 with women , minorities and young votersâ € ” three critical voting blocs that helped president @entity129 win re-election			2
the report comes as the @entity47 @entity131 considers two politically charged same - sex marriage cases			1
one involves the federal the @entity133 , which defines marriage as between a man and a woman and was supported by @entity4			2
the other appeal involves a @entity140 law banning gay marriage			0
but when it comes to same - sex marriage , the @entity8 will still face opposition from many members			1
" these latest , sudden changes in opinion are classic examples of caving in to political pressure , " @entity146 , president of the @entity146 , said in a statement			0
@entity4 called fellow @entity9 and @entity154 speaker @entity153 to inform him of his revised position according to a @entity153 spokesman			2
" senator @entity4 is a great friend and ally and the speaker respects his position , but the speaker continues to think that marriage is between a man and woman , " said @entity157 , @entity153 's spokesman			1
top @entity8 sign brief supporting same - sex marriage hours after @entity4 announced that he had reversed his position on same - sex marriage , former house speaker @entity164 said he would not second - guess him			1
but he 's not entirely embracing @entity4 's change of heart , either			1
@entity4 told @entity1 's @entity167 that he wanted all of his children to experience the " joy and stability of marriage " that he and his wife have had for 26 years			1
this includes " our son , who is gay			0
" @entity176 tweeted friday that he is " especially proud of my dad today			0
" @entity178 acknowledged on @entity1 's " @entity179 " that when an immediate family member reveals that he or she is gay , there are typically three responses			0
" you can say , ' i believe my principles so much , i 'm kicking you out			0
' you can say , ' i still believe in my principles , but i love you			0
' or you can say , ' @entity186 , i love you so much , i am changing my principles , ' " @entity178 said			0
" @entity4 picked the third path			2
" the former presidential candidate stands by his own belief that a marriage is between a man and a woman , and argued the traditional definition will stay in place " no matter what politicians " do			0
" i do n't think they have the power to change what is a religiously inspired definition , " @entity178 said			0
former @entity204 sen. @entity203 , a social conservative who ran for president in 2012 , said @entity4 's about - face was personal and does n't reflect the party 's broader direction on social values			1
" i 'm not too sure the rationale behind what senator @entity4 's doing is something that has broad application to the base , " @entity203 told @entity1			1
" the fundamental principles that attach to the institution of marriage really have n't changed as a result of that personal story			2
we need to look at what 's right , what 's right for the @entity47 public and more importantly , what 's right for children			0
so we need to try and fight for those things			0
" @entity32 said it will be up to younger conservatives who support same - sex marriage to help change views within the @entity8			1
" it 's going to take younger conservative voters to send a message to their party elders that that message is unacceptable , " he said			2
some on the right , however , applauded @entity4 's decision			1
@entity245 , executive director of the @entity27 , said in a statement " if there was any doubt that the conservative logjam on the issue of civil marriage for committed gay and lesbian couples has broken , senator @entity4 's support for the freedom to marry has erased it			1
" " ( his ) evolution on this issue highlights how personal it is for @entity47 -- whether they 're the junior senator from @entity9 or your next - door neighbor , all @entity47 have a gay friend , colleague or family member , and understand them to be as deserving as their straight counterparts of the inalienable rights of life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness that are the promise of the @entity47 , " @entity245 continued			0
@entity1 's @entity269 , @entity270 , @entity271 , @entity272 and @entity273 contributed to this report .			0

some conservative millennials more accepting of same - sex marriage , polls , experts say
@entity8 will have to work to consider younger , socially liberal and older , conservative positions
