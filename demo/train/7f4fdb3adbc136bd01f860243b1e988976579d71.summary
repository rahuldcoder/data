what a difference two years makes			2
when @entity2 became the first sitting @entity4 president to visit @entity5 in 2012 , there was much fanfare about the country 's political reforms and apparent road to democracy after decades of oppressive military rule			1
but as @entity2 and other world leaders gather in @entity5 this week for the @entity14 ( @entity14 ) summit , the situation is not as rosy as many had hoped			1
" parts of the reform effort have stalled , parts have moved forward , and parts we 've even seen things move backward , " deputy @entity4 national security adviser @entity16 said thursday			2
" so i think it 's a mixed picture			2
" two years after @entity2 's historic visit , @entity5 's parliament is still largely dominated by the military			1
and the human rights crisis faced by the @entity28 in @entity29 is as dire as ever			2
' internment camps ' the crisis in @entity29 began in may 2012 , when the rape and murder of a @entity35 woman by @entity37 men ignited long - standing tensions between the @entity35 majority and @entity41 muslims			1
in 2012 , clashes between @entity43 and @entity41 , a long - oppressed linguistic and ethnic minority in this majority @entity35 country , left hundreds of people dead and more than 140,000 people homeless			2
across @entity29 , more than 130,000 other displaced people are trapped in 67 camps			2
the majority of them are de facto stateless @entity28 , living under apartheid - like conditions			0
most have been there since the violence in october 2012 , after their villages were destroyed			0
they endure wretched conditions , such as frequent flooding and filthy water			0
skin diseases and gastrointestinal problems are common			0
but they ca n't leave without police escort			0
that rule is " to prevent further clashes and ( ensure ) their safety , " minister of information @entity68 told @entity73			0
but the settlements " have essentially become internment camps " for about 140,000 people , according to a report by the @entity78			0
" people have been here two years and they have nothing			0
nothing , " a humanitarian worker said			0
" the desperation is extremely high , and it 's increasing			0
" president @entity84 reportedly told a visiting @entity86 delegation that the government did not recognize the @entity41 as citizens of @entity5 , also known as @entity5 , and was planning to install them in refugee camps until another country could be found to take them			1
@entity2 and the @entity5 president will meet this week			1
@entity93 , a senior fellow for @entity94 at the @entity95 , said @entity2 should pressure the @entity5 government to push ahead with political changes and rethink its " racist " plan for the @entity41			1
but a senior @entity4 official cautioned not to expect any major leaps forward any time soon			0
" i do n't think we 're going to see breakthroughs in the short term , " said @entity101 , the @entity4 assistant secretary of state for human rights and labor			0
" @entity5 was an opening to a breakthrough , and it 's one that we always knew would take years to move from its starting point to its finishing point			1
" stunted democracy on top of the @entity41 human rights crisis , @entity5 is no where near the democratic country that some had hoped for			1
after decades in power , the country 's military junta stepped down , and a civilian government was sworn in to office in 2011			2
but the military still has substantial power			0
the country 's current constitution stipulates that 25 % of the seats in parliament are held by members of the military , and the military has veto power			0
@entity2 will meet with fellow @entity133 winner @entity132 on friday			1
the pro-democracy icon spent years under house arrest by the country 's military rulers before becoming a parliamentarian in 2012			0
while many democracy advocates want @entity132 to run for president next year , the government prohibits it			1
the @entity5 constitution , written by the military in 2008 , forbids anyone married to a foreigner to become president			1
@entity132 's husband , who died in 1999 , was @entity149			1
even @entity132 has come under criticism for staying largely silent on the @entity41 crisis .			1

world leaders are gathering in @entity5 for the @entity14 summit
@entity2 could *discuss* *plight* of the @entity37 minority in @entity5
the government does not recognize *rohingyas* as citizens
@entity2 will meet with @entity132 , who has been criticized for her silence on the issue
