@entity0 -- an @entity4 - @entity3 dual citizen who died in an @entity3 prison gave @entity4 intelligence details of his work with @entity3 's @entity8 before his arrest , an @entity4 television network reported tuesday			1
the fate of the man dubbed " @entity13 " is now the subject of an investigation by @entity3 's parliament			1
prime minister @entity17 pleaded over the weekend for details to be kept quiet , warning " overexposure of security and intelligence activity " could harm @entity3 's security			1
but the @entity23 has identified him as @entity24 , and it reported tuesday that he had reported " every aspect of his work " for the @entity8 , @entity3 's spy agency , to the @entity25			1
@entity29 reportedly committed suicide in @entity3 's @entity31 in december 2010 , about 10 months after his arrest , according to @entity23			1
his incarceration was a state secret , and @entity3 has never confirmed the prisoner 's name or how he died			1
@entity23 , citing unnamed sources , reported tuesday that @entity29 gave @entity4 " comprehensive detail about a number of @entity8 operations , including plans for a top - secret mission in @entity43 that had been years in the making			2
" @entity29 helped @entity8 set up a @entity46 communications company that sold electronics to @entity49 countries and @entity50 , according to the network			0
he met with @entity4 intelligence during a trip back to @entity4 , @entity23 reported			1
it was n't clear who approached whom -- but @entity23 said it " believes " @entity29 was arrested after @entity8 discovered his contact with @entity25 , fearing he had given up @entity3 secrets			1
a committee of @entity3 's @entity59 announced sunday that it would look into all aspects of the case , much of which remains under a gag order			1
details about what happened to " @entity13 " -- and why -- remain elusive			2
' we are not like other countries , ' @entity17 says in his weekly @entity69 address sunday , prime minister @entity17 insisted @entity3 is committed to freedom of expression			1
" however , the overexposure of security and intelligence activity could harm , sometimes severely , state security , " he said			2
" we are not like other countries , " @entity17 added			2
" we are an exemplary democracy and maintain the rights of those under investigation and individual rights no less than any other country			0
however , we are more threatened and face more challenges ; therefore , we must maintain proper activity of our security agencies			0
and therefore , i ask all of you , let the security forces do their work quietly so that we can continue to live in security and tranquility in the state of @entity3			2
" @entity3 's ' @entity13 ' : death of man with alleged spy agency ties for two years , a government gag order prevented local journalists in @entity3 from telling the story			1
but after @entity23 brought the case to light last week , an @entity3 court appeared to publicly confirm details about the case for the first time			1
a statement from the court described a " prisoner who was both an @entity3 citizen and a foreign national			2
" " the inmate was registered under a false identity for security reasons , but his family was notified immediately upon his arrest , " the statement said			0
the court lifted part of the gag order , saying local media could quote foreign publications ' reporting on the case -- but they could not do their own reporting on the story			0
criticism within @entity3 some @entity3 lawmakers sharply criticized the government 's handling of the matter			1
" when unknown prisoners commit suicide and nobody knows who he is , how does that fit with a democracy with law which is proper ? " @entity134 , leader of the @entity135 , asked last week			0
pressed for answers by another lawmaker , justice minister @entity136 said that the matter should be investigated			0
but he said he could not answer the questions " because the subject is not under the jurisdiction of the @entity143			0
" @entity144 , chief legal council for the @entity145 , sent a letter to @entity3 's attorney general about the case , criticizing the censorship and calling for the gag order to be scaled back further			2
" what is far more concerning , of course , is the fact that a man was held in detention under heavy secrecy , and nothing was published about the reason for his arrest or the circumstances surrounding his death , " @entity144 wrote			0
a culture of censorship all journalists who apply for a government - issued @entity3 press card must sign documents agreeing to the military censorship			2
according to the agreement , journalists will not publish security information that could benefit @entity3 's enemies or harm the state			0
breaking the rule could result in card revocation , and foreign journalists could lose their visas to work there			0
in recent years , the censorship mechanism for checking scripts and pictures has rarely been practiced			0
controls over content have faded more and more with the internet as more freedom of information passes into the public domain			0
recent news of @entity13 's case prompted @entity4 foreign minister @entity190 to request an internal report			1
" i 'm advised in the form of an interim report that the @entity4 government was informed in february 2010 , though intelligence channels , that the @entity3 authorities had detained a dual @entity4 - @entity3 citizen , and they provided the name of the citizen , in relation to serious offenses under @entity3 national security legislation , " @entity190 told a @entity193 committee thursday			1
he did not mention what the alleged " serious offenses " were			0
@entity190 said @entity4 sought specific assurances from @entity3 , such as that the detainee would get legal representation of his choosing and that he would not be mistreated			1
" at no stage during his detention did the @entity4 government receive any requests from the individual or his family to extend consular support , " @entity190 said			0
" the @entity4 government was advised through intelligence channels on december 16 , 2010 , ( of ) this individual 's death on the previous day , and the deceased 's family had been notified by @entity3 authorities			1
