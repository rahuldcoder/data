-- the @entity2 website might still not be working , but journalists are			1
all across the country , as @entity5 try to highlight tragic tales of @entity7 losing their current health insurance and allegedly stuck with more expensive options , journalists are coming to the rescue			1
in case after case , journalists investigated these stories and called the policyholders and combed the insurance exchange websites to bring actual facts to bear in our public debate about @entity2			1
here are just some of the mythical stories journalists have helped dispel â € ” and the lessons we can learn from them about the reality of the @entity2 : @entity27 was making the rounds on television complaining about how her current insurance plan was canceled under @entity2			1
so @entity32 columnist @entity31 talked to her			0
her current plan cost $ 293 per month but had a deductible of $ 5,000 per year and out - of - pocket annual limits of $ 8,500			1
also , the current plan covered just two doctor 's visits per year			0
but in the @entity40 insurance exchange , which @entity31 helped @entity27 check , she could get a " silver " plan for $ 333 per month â € ” $ 40 more than she 's currently paying			0
but the new plan has only a $ 2,000 deductible and maximum out - of - pocket expenses at $ 6,350			2
plus all doctor visits would be covered			0
@entity31 writes , " is that better than her current plan ? yes , by a mile			0
" @entity50 also popped up on television on a @entity53 news report in which she lamented that her $ 54 - per - month insurance plan had been canceled under @entity2			1
but @entity55 at @entity56 investigated @entity50 's story and found that her current policy was a " textbook example of a junk plan that is n't real health insurance at all			0
" according to @entity55 , if @entity50 had ever tried to use her insurance for anything more than a sporadic doctor 's visit , " she would have ended up with tens or hundreds of thousands of dollars of medical debt			0
" the plan , for instance , only pays for hospitalization in cases of " complications of pregnancy			0
" instead , @entity55 found that @entity50 could get a " silver " plan in the state insurance exchange for $ 165 per month that would actually cover @entity50 in the case of any sort of serious or even moderate illness			2
which is the very definition of insurance , is n't it ? @entity85 , a stage - four gallbladder cancer survivor , published an op - ed in the @entity88 blaming the @entity2 for her canceled insurance policy			1
in her essay , @entity90 wrote that because of @entity2 , " i have been forced to give up a world - class health plan			1
" but , according to @entity98 of @entity99 , @entity97 's insurer , @entity100 , " dropped her coverage because they 've struggled to compete in @entity40 's individual health care market for years and did n't want to pay for sicker patients like @entity97			0
" earlier this year , @entity100 , which has publicly supported the @entity2 , announced that it would pull out of the individual market in @entity40			1
a company representative said it withdrew because its individual plans have never had a huge presence in the state			0
according to @entity100 , and in compliance with state law , the company wo n't be able to re-enter the @entity40 individual market until 2017			2
by then though , competitors will get stuck with sicker patients like @entity97 signing up in the first wave of @entity2			1
this means that companies like @entity100 can cover cheaper patients if it decides to go back to the @entity40 individual insurance market			0
according to a report by @entity117 at @entity118 , a @entity120 woman named @entity121 received a cancellation letter from her insurance company regarding her current plan			0
the letter steered @entity121 and her family into a more expensive option and said , " if you 're happy with this plan , do nothing			0
" the letter made no mention of the @entity135 insurance exchange , where @entity121 could find plenty of other more affordable choices , because the company wanted a convenient excuse to jack up @entity121 's rates			0
had @entity121 " done nothing , " she would have ended up spending about $ 1,000 more per month on insurance than the cost of insurance she ultimately chose through the @entity2 exchange			1
in fact , the practice of trying to mislead customers has become so widespread that @entity135 regulators issued a consumer alert to customers			2
this is just the tip of the iceberg			0
republicans who have been desperate from the very beginning to destroy @entity2 at any cost , regardless of facts or the urgent health care crisis facing @entity7 , will continue to dig up stories of people supposedly harmed by the law			1
and journalists will hopefully continue to investigate these allegations , helping us all sort fact from fiction			1
in the meantime , there 's a side benefit to all this : if you are one of the small fraction of @entity7 who currently relies on the individual insurance market and has seen your current policy canceled , call a journalist â € ” like one of those in the stories above			2
reporters all across the country are hungry for real - life stories about how @entity2 is working			1
plus , most reporters have access to high - speed internet			2
if you ca n't get through to the @entity2 exchange site , there 's a journalist standing by willing to help you navigate the exchange options and explore your pros and cons in terms of costs and benefits			2
the website might still be glitchy , but old - fashioned shoe - leather reporting is as reliable as ever			1
editor 's note : this article has been updated to include @entity100 ' explanation of its withdrawal from @entity40 's individual insurance marketplace			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2

@entity203 : @entity5 are desperate to destroy @entity2 at any cost
@entity203 : stories about people supposedly harmed by the law are not always true
she says journalists are digging into allegations , helping us all sort fact from fiction
@entity203 : the website still has glitches , but old - fashioned reporting is very reliable
