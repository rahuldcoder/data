-- there 's presumably no going back this time			0
@entity2 is leaving the " @entity4 " on thursday after nearly 22 years as host			1
@entity5 , with less than five years on @entity7 's follow - up " @entity8 " shift , takes over on february 17			0
his successor , " @entity10 " mainstay @entity9 , is set to step in a week later			0
it 's still not clear exactly why @entity7 is dumping @entity2 , the king of late night in all key audience measurements , including advertiser - prized 18 - to 49 - year - olds			1
he 's well ahead of @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 and @entity20			1
@entity7 programming executives ' only explanation , in the network 's initial april 2013 announcement , was that " @entity5 is a unique talent and this is his time			0
" but @entity2 does leave a legacy , and it 's not just repeatedly taking it on his ample chin from both @entity7 and countless detractors			2
nor is it the fact that his departure will likely set off a wave of new tensions in the late - night landscape ( more on that later )			1
i think @entity2 's stature slowly will improve with age as the undisputed " people 's champ " in times when tv critics for the most part dismissed him as a lightweight			1
@entity16 , @entity18 and @entity17 have been deemed the " smart , " inventive late - night hosts , but @entity2 has arguably been the hardest - working man in late night -- even if as a plodder , not a craftsman			1
and ratings do n't lie			2
@entity2 's farewell : his best punchlines @entity2 's principal strength , as was @entity53 's , has been his extended monologues			2
he can reliably reel off jokes in assembly line fashion , making " @entity4 " an easy , effortless tune - in			1
follow - up segments such as " headlines " and " @entity60 " also have kept audiences from going elsewhere or going to bed			0
but the second half of @entity2 's " @entity4 " has been the show 's soft midsection			1
his patter with guests invariably feels preordained			0
@entity68 , who had a comparatively short run in the " @entity4 " chair in the years before @entity53 , was the show 's pre-eminent conversationalist			1
as guest @entity74 noted this week , nothing was rehearsed or prescrubbed with @entity68			0
you winged it , and you 'd better have something to say			0
@entity53 relied far more heavily on " blue card " crib notes that have become talk show staples during interview segments			0
but his big , boisterous laugh could break out at any moment -- infectious for viewers and the sound of music for any guest who could get a rise out of @entity53			0
@entity2 mostly titters under his breath , more schoolgirl giggler than full - throated bonhomie			1
still , he has kept the ratings singing for @entity7 , and in a much more crowded late night universe than @entity53 ever experienced			1
@entity2 , of course , ca n't touch @entity53 , the program 's acknowledged " gold standard			1
" and @entity53 made it no secret that he wanted @entity16 , not @entity2 , to succeed him			1
all these years later , @entity16 in reality is the only late night host who even belongs in the same conversation with @entity53			1
for his part , the 66 - year - old @entity16 is good to go through at least 2015 via a recently signed deal with @entity103			1
but i would n't particularly want to be him once @entity15 takes over " @entity4			1
" for the first time in his long tenure at @entity103 he 'll have to compete directly against a @entity108 - based host who also happens to be a generation younger			2
that could be a serious problem when it comes to attracting a more contemporary collection of guests during the @entity108 legs of their publicity tours			0
( @entity119 , for one , already is basically a member of @entity15 's repertory company			2
) but it could work quite well for @entity17 , who now will have the @entity124 all to himself opposite his @entity7 and @entity103 rivals			0
@entity16 also will be the last of the late night " social media " luddites after @entity2 walks the plank			1
in contrast , @entity15 is a skilled @entity131 practitioner with 11.4 million followers			2
@entity15 is also a deft impressionist and accomplished sketch player ; neither are @entity16 strengths			1
what @entity15 does n't have so far is @entity2 's monologue gene			1
he 'll have to lengthen his joke - telling segment , which could ripen in time			0
for now it 's easily the weakest part of his game , giving both @entity16 and @entity17 the openings they might need -- both literally and figuratively			2
@entity15 's big plus is a big kid likability that makes him easy to root for			1
his humor can be barbed , but he clearly aims to please			0
in contrast to @entity16 and @entity147 , he always wants to be his guests ' -- and his audience 's -- very best friend			2
but there 's no discernible edge			0
even @entity2 throws an occasional jab			2
in truth , @entity7 's latest late night moves could and probably should have waited a few more years			2
@entity2 has done nothing but win and win again with no signs of weakness			0
as a further indignity he 's being sacked as a 63 - year - old even as @entity7 is developing a new sitcom for the 76 - year - old @entity162			0
out with the old , in with the older			0
one more intriguing thing : @entity9 , at age 40 , is a year older than @entity15			0
@entity7 's later slot historically has gone to a host who 's a generation younger , with the idea of grooming him for the " @entity4 " desk			1
but if @entity15 succeeds -- and that 's certainly what his network wants -- might @entity7 in effect be showcasing and setting up @entity176 for a jump to a rival network someday ? after all , he presumably wants to move up at some point , too			0
but where would he go ? pardon @entity7 for just not wanting to think about that right now			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity185 .			0

@entity185 : @entity2 , *inexplicably* dumped as " @entity4 " host , has final show thursday
he says critics have n't been big fans , but public was ; his @entity194 ratings *dominate* late - night
he says departure *shakes* up late - night , makes @entity16 , last of old - schoolers , *vulnerable*
bark : @entity15 likable and appeals to younger crowd , but short on some late - night host skills
