@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is 22 , with a diagnosis of terminal brain cancer			1
he knows that " horrible stuff " lies ahead			0
his mother , @entity8 , has been taking care of him full time			2
but when she needed help , she reached out to the @entity11			0
after all , his father is a priest			1
@entity3 was born in 1986 , during a five - year affair between his mother and father @entity15 , the @entity16 priest who celebrated @entity3 's baptism			1
in a story first reported in the @entity20 , it was revealed that the @entity16 drew up an agreement acknowledging the boy 's paternity and agreeing to pay child support in exchange for a pledge of confidentiality			1
now her son -- the youngest of four children -- may have just weeks to live			0
and when the @entity16 balked at paying for his care , she decided she was no longer bound by her pledge of confidentiality			0
" i never asked for extraordinary amounts			0
i asked for the basic needs and care of my son , " @entity8 told @entity2 's " @entity38			2
" but she said the church told her , " no , we are not @entity3 's biological father , we have no legal obligation to your son			1
" @entity15 , whose priestly vows require celibacy , has been suspended from his most recent assignment , in northern @entity47 , as @entity49 leaders investigate allegations that he was involved with another woman -- then in high school -- around the same time he was seeing @entity8			1
@entity15 has acknowledged his relationship with @entity8 , but denies any inappropriate relationship with the other woman while she was a minor , according to his current bishop			1
and his order acknowledges its agreement to support his son , telling @entity2 they have paid about $ 233,000 to support @entity3 over his lifetime			1
since the affair has become public , the @entity16 has agreed to pick up @entity3 's medical bills and the costs for the funeral that now appears likely			1
@entity15 refused to speak to @entity2			1
but a statement to his parishioners in @entity68 , @entity47 , in september , said , " my failure to be faithful to my vows has caused me and many others pain and disappointment			0
i have regretted this for a long time			0
" and in october , he told the @entity20 , " we 've been very caring , very supportive , very generous over these 20 - something years			0
it 's very tragic what 's going on with @entity3			1
" @entity8 , then @entity78 , said she and @entity15 began their affair in 1983			1
at the time , @entity15 was a priest in her hometown of @entity83 , @entity84 , about 130 miles north of @entity85 , @entity1			1
@entity8 , then a 27 - year - old , married mother of three , went to a retreat for women with troubled relationships			2
@entity15 was the retreat 's spiritual director , and she said he was a " terrific " priest -- " incredibly charismatic , very sought - after			1
" he began to counsel her on a regular basis			0
after about three months , at the end of one of their sessions , she said he kissed her			0
@entity8 said she went home and immediately asked her husband for a separation , and she said she began a romantic relationship with @entity15			1
@entity8 said she knew he was forbidden to have sex with her			0
but she said when in love , " you do n't think clearly			0
" " i make stupid decisions in my life , " she said			0
" i am not perfect , far from sainthood , and i loved him			0
" during their relationship , @entity8 was a lay leader in the church , and " we were a very good team , a very dynamic team , " she said			2
but in 1985 , she learned she was pregnant			0
the pregnancy ended with a miscarriage that october			0
she said in its aftermath , she ended her sexual relationship with @entity15 , only to resume it the following spring			1
it was during that period that @entity3 was conceived , she said			1
@entity3 was born in december 1986			2
@entity15 had to disclose the affair and @entity8 's pregnancy to his superiors			1
a deal was negotiated by father @entity124 , who told @entity2 the @entity16 insisted on confidentiality " to protect @entity3 , his mother , and the priest			1
" but @entity124 , now on the research faculty of the @entity129 at @entity130 in @entity131 , @entity132 , also acknowledged the goal in part was to protect the church			2
the agreement was reached about a year after @entity3 's birth			1
afterward , @entity15 was removed from his job , and it was 17 years before he would lead a congregation again			2
he told his superiors that his relationship with @entity8 was over , but she said it continued			0
" that was the statement , and they bought it , " @entity8 said			0
" but the truth of the matter is during those eight month of negotiations , we were living together physically , sexually and every form of relationship there was under their nose			0
" the relationship went on until @entity3 was nearly 2 years old , @entity8 said			2
she and @entity15 went on family outings , including a trip to @entity159 , with @entity3 and her children from her previous marriage			1
back in @entity83 , where she grew up , @entity8 said she had a simple answer to questions about @entity3 's parentage : " he 's my baby			1
" but things ended in 1988 , after @entity8 learned that @entity15 was seeing another woman			2
she eventually moved from @entity83 to a @entity85 suburb			0
" you had to go away , you had to take your story , you had to take your children , you had to get out of this town			0
we 're a small community , everybody knew everybody , " she said			0
@entity3 grew up as a popular , athletic boy , a big fan of the @entity180 baseball club and the @entity182 hockey team			2
he has autographs of the entire hockey team and a @entity180 uniform signed by @entity187 first baseman @entity186			0
for years , he said , he wanted a relationship with his father			2
" he 's popped in and out of my life , but i 've never gotten the full respect and love out of him that i would always want , " he said			2
but several years ago , after @entity15 took him out to dinner on their first night out in years , he said his father did n't seem to want to have anything to do with him			1
" when it comes to this person who 's my dad , who should be helping me out more than a person on the street , he has n't done so throughout my 20 - plus years of life , " @entity3 said			1
@entity3 was diagnosed with cancer in 2006			1
over the summer , he and his mother went to @entity132 's @entity205 in a last - ditch effort to halt the disease			2
it was unsuccessful , and doctors give him a prognosis of weeks			0
" if i just live my life as happy as i can , i can have a lot of fun until this horrible stuff happens , " he said			0
the church had paid for some medical expenses and gave her $ 1,000 toward travel expenses for the trip , but not room and board or treatment costs , @entity8 said			2
and in the past week , she said , the church was questioning the cost of a looming funeral			0
" they were concerned with getting us out of their lives , and i guarantee you , the day my son goes , the church will rejoice , " she said			0
since she went public , the @entity16 wrote a letter to @entity8 telling her they will cover 100 percent of her son 's funeral costs -- and added , " please advise if there is any additional assistance that the @entity16 can provide to @entity3 at this time in connection with his day - to - day expenses and comfort			1
" the order also has since said it will not take @entity8 to court for breaching the confidentiality of the agreement			0
for four years before september , @entity15 was a priest at @entity245 church in @entity68 , @entity47			1
bishop @entity246 , whose diocese includes the church , said @entity15 was a good priest -- but added , " because of his behavior 23 years ago , the community is now suffering			1
" @entity3 will not be going back to the hospital and will die at home , @entity8 said			2
she ca n't afford a part - time nurse to help take care of him in his last days , but said she hopes the church lives up to its word .			0

@entity3 's father is the priest who baptized him , @entity15
@entity3 's mother made a confidential agreement with the church to keep @entity15 's identity secret
