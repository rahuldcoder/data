@entity0 -- @entity2 and @entity3 wednesday pledged not to let their fragile peace process slide again because of thorny issues that have made the nuclear neighbors bitter enemies			1
@entity3 's new foreign minister @entity9 met her @entity2 counterpart @entity10 in @entity0 in an engagement that saw no major breakthroughs over outstanding disputes but a commitment to pursue dialogue			1
their talks came barely two weeks after three deadly explosions ripped through @entity19 , an attack that revived memories of the 2008 terror siege of @entity2 's financial hub			2
@entity3 was quick to condemn the july 13 bombings of @entity19 while @entity0 was careful not to finger @entity25			2
" this is indeed a new era of bilateral cooperation between the two countries and it is our desire , and i believe after having spoken to you mister foreign minister , that it is the desire and commitment of both the governments to make it an uninterrupted and uninterruptable process , " @entity9 remarked , standing beside the @entity2 leader after their meeting			1
in his comments , @entity10 too acknowledged sustained negotiations were the way forward			0
" we have reaffirmed our commitment to resolve all outstanding issues through a comprehensive , serious and sustained dialogue			2
while being fully cognizant of the challenges that lie ahead , i can confidently say that our relations are on the right track , " he said			0
" we have some distance to travel , but with an open mind and a constructive approach , which has been demonstrated in this round of dialogue , i am sure we can reach our desired destination of having a friendly and cooperative relationship between the two countries , " @entity10 added			0
as part of their confidence - building measures , both sides agreed to double the frequency of trade across @entity63 -- the disputed region divided between the countries -- to four days a week			0
the current three - year agreement involves 21 locally made items , which a joint statement issued after the talks said would be reviewed for possible additions			0
@entity2 and @entity3 have have fought three wars since the partition of the @entity74 subcontinent in 1947 , two of them over @entity63 , which both nations claim			1
" the ministers held discussions on the issue of @entity82 and @entity63 and agreed to the need for continued discussions , in a purposeful and forward looking manner , with a view to finding a peaceful solution by narrowing divergences and building convergences , " the joint statement noted			0
earlier this year , @entity0 and @entity25 agreed to resume peace talks frozen by the 2008 @entity19 strikes , which have been blamed on @entity3 - based militant groups			2
under @entity95 pressure , @entity2 and @entity3 leaders held meetings last year in a bid to put their dialogue back on track , but no dramatic headway has been made			1
in 2004 , the nations agreed to negotiations that cover eight issues , including @entity63 , terrorism and @entity3 's concerns over river dams on the @entity2 side of the border , which it sees as a threat to its water supplies			1
since then , successive governments have held talks in an effort to end the historical acrimony			0
@entity2 prime minister @entity116 and @entity3 's president @entity117 hailed results from the dialogue in september 2008 as the countries completed four rounds of diplomatic meetings			1
but talks were suspended two months later , in november 2008 , after the terror raid on @entity19 that left more than 160 people dead .			0
