for the 160 - plus inmates at the @entity3 prison camp here , each sunrise brings a new day that most would rather starve than endure			1
for the @entity3 troops who guard them , each day brings a daily rain of obscenities and filth -- sometimes physical as well as verbal			1
more than a decade after the first inmates arrived at the @entity3 base where prisoners from the @entity3 war on terror are being held , @entity11 is a facility in crisis			1
from the 700 - plus detainees it once held , only 166 remain			1
of those , more than half have been approved for transfers out , but languish as the @entity25 administration and @entity27 battle over whether to shut down the facility			1
a handful are facing trial before military commissions , a process that has been criticized as both inefficient and unfair			1
" the commissions are a joke , " inmate @entity33 wrote to his lawyer in march			1
" if you lose you go to prison for life			1
if you win , you 're held indefinately ( sic ) for life			2
" @entity40 has been held in @entity11 since 2008 , transferred there after being held by the @entity41			2
the @entity42 said he was one of @entity46 founder @entity45 's " most trusted facilitators and procurement specialists			2
" more than half are on hunger strikes			1
some will take liquid nutritional supplements , but about 30 are being force - fed -- a practice condemned by human rights groups and the @entity53			2
the military has brought in additional medical staff to manage the protest			2
opinion : stop force feeding inmates most of the inmates have been moved to two blocks , dubbed @entity63 and @entity64			1
for the most part , they look like a typical civilian prison , with two tiers of cells that face out onto a room full of metal tables			2
the air conditioning delivers a chilly blast when walking in from the muggy tropical air outside			2
the detainees used to be allowed to live communally , but that ended after a raid turned up homemade weapons			1
now they 're held in individual cells with heavy steel doors			2
they 're allowed to watch movies and even some news programs in recliners in media rooms -- with their feet shackled to the floor			2
they 're guarded by @entity3 , some of them not yet old enough to drink , who face a daily torrent of abuse			2
" they use extremely vulgar language towards females , and i 've had a lot of experience with that , unfortunately , " said one young woman who serves as a guard there			2
" especially @entity103 females -- they do not like us at all			2
" the military would not allow her to be identified , and even her nametag displayed only a number			0
but she says she 's 21 and has already served a tour as a guard at the military prison at @entity112 , @entity113			0
in @entity11 , the prisoners call her a bitch			0
but worse than the name - calling is what the guards call " splashing " -- flinging urine or feces on the guards			1
it happens to someone " every single day " for the last month and a half , she said			1
" they 'll say things like , ' i 'll piss all over your face , ' " she said			0
" they 'll say , oh , you 've had shit thrown on you , been disrespected , ' or ' nobody wants you , you 're trash now			0
' " the cell doors have what are called " splash boxes " through which food is passed			1
they 're designed to minimize contact with inmates and reduce splashing , but they do n't eliminate it			1
the walls and floors are quickly scrubbed down , but bits of feces are still visible stuck to the foam ceiling tiles in the units			1
the young guard said those " splashed " -- and she 's been among them -- are sent to the camp hospital , notified of any diseases their assailant may carry , have their blood tested -- " and then you go right back to work			0
" the prison camp opened in 2002			0
president @entity25 came into office vowing to close the prison camp , and told reporters in april that he still wants to shut it down			1
opinion : terror threat from @entity11 prisoners is exaggerated " i think it is critical for us to understand that @entity11 is not necessary to keep @entity3 safe , " he told reporters in a @entity169 news conference			0
it hurts us , in terms of our international standing			0
it lessens cooperation with our allies on counterterrorism efforts			0
it is a recruitment tool for extremists			0
it needs to be closed			0
" but @entity27 has forbidden the administration from moving the detainees to prisons stateside			1
the administration halted transfers of 56 inmates from @entity190 in 2010 because of what @entity25 called the " unsettled situation " in that country , an @entity46 hotbed			1
a handful of the detainees have faced trial before military commissions			1
cases are pending against a number of others , including @entity201 , the self - professed organizer of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on @entity203 and @entity204			0
but they 're progressing at a glacial pace , while some low - ranking inmates who pleaded guilty have been returned to their home countries			1
" it 's a bizarre , perverted system of justice where being convicted of a war crime is your ticket home , " former air force col. @entity214 , once the chief prosecutor at @entity11 , told @entity217 's " @entity218 " program tuesday			0
" and if you 're never charged , much less convicted , you spend the rest of your life sitting at @entity11			0
" @entity214 quit his post in 2007 , declaring that the prosecutions of several suspected terrorists had become " deeply politicized			0
" the frozen status of the detainees has fueled the hunger strikes , which grew from about a half - dozen inmates at first to more than 100 now			1
" this is kind of the only option they have left , to say , ' hey , we 're still here			0
we are still your problem			0
are you just gon na let us rot in here until the end of time ? ' " said @entity232 , a lawyer who represents several detainees			1
about 30 of them refuse to take even liquid nutritional drinks and have to be fed through tubes shoved down their noses			0
the @entity53 has criticized the practice , calling it a violation of the profession 's core ethics			0
" every competent patient has the right to refuse medical intervention , including life - sustaining interventions , " @entity53 president @entity245 wrote in an april letter to defense secretary @entity247			0
the @entity42 says the feeding program is lawful and humane			0
but capt. @entity253 , a spokesman for the detention facility , acknowledges that the options for the administrators are dwindling			1
" if anybody 's had a can of ensure or @entity261 , it says right on it it 's not designed to be a long - term , sole source of nutrition , " @entity253 said			0
" so there are long - term consequences of getting all your meals through a liquid supplement			0

more than half the 166 detainees are on hunger strikes
inmates *routinely* taunt and splash guards with urine and feces
@entity25 says he still wants to close the facility
