-- the @entity2 soldier , who had meager possessions , must have been proud of his ring and its distinctive diamond - shaped centerpiece			1
somehow , the size - 11 ring was lost , discarded or left behind , only to be swallowed by the earth on a rise near @entity10 , @entity11			1
untouched by human hands for nearly 150 years , the ring recently was discovered by archaeology students who have unearthed more artifacts at the site of @entity17 , a @entity19 stockade and prison			1
the @entity22 team is finding personal items that will help tell the desperate story of @entity26 soldiers who tried to stay alive while food was scarce and disease rampant			1
" the camp is as rich in information as we thought it was , " said @entity29 , a graduate student who last spring found the first of what promises to be an astounding yield of artifacts			1
the university in @entity38 thursday unveiled more than a dozen of the 60 to 70 items uncovered last month			1
the school 's museum also has acquired what 's believed to be the only surviving letter from a prisoner at the short - lived camp			2
the recent finds include a pocketknife , buckle , a @entity51 - made token used for trading and a couple of keys			2
the man 's ring and a uniform or cap badge were found within 10 feet of each other , according to @entity29			1
the badge also includes a diamond feature			2
the @entity22 team believes the diamonds may represent the @entity26 's @entity64 , which saw action in numerous battles , including @entity67 and @entity68 , before a reorganization in march 1864 saw it merged with other units			1
the corps used a diamond on its flags and insignia			2
" they were so proud of their service they wore badges long after it disbanded , " @entity29 said of the @entity64 veterans			2
@entity29 says if that portion of the camp is shown to have housed veterans of the @entity64 , descendants may one day be able to gaze at the precise spot where an ancestor lived			2
" you can touch that ground and connect to 150 years before , " he told @entity0			2
@entity29 found the precise location of the slave - built stockade last year and , in the soil beneath tall pine trees , the first of nearly 300 artifacts recovered at the site of the @entity98 's largest prison			1
the first find was detailed this time last year by the @entity101 , the @entity102 and @entity22			1
the prisoner artifacts were located on federal property -- the @entity105			1
the camp 's location also extends into state property , the adjoining @entity17 , where the @entity98 commissary , hospital and commander quarters existed			2
only archaeologists and other officials are allowed on the fenced - in dig site on the hatchery grounds			1
this discovery of so many @entity19 - era items -- including a smoking pipe , uniform buttons , a picture frame , coins , utensils , bullets and objects fashioned by @entity26 prisoners -- is unparalleled for many reasons , archaeologists said			1
@entity19 prisoner 's letter : ' hopeing the scene may soon change ' with the exception of a farmer 's plow 100 years ago , the 42 acres about 80 miles northwest of @entity130 have been largely untouched			2
that includes being missed by relic hunters and looters who , federal officials say , " are both thieves of time			1
" over the years , people have picked clean known @entity19 sites , including the notorious @entity143 prison site in west - central @entity11			1
@entity17 was built to help ease @entity143 's overcrowding			2
the site 's remote location and maps describing it as brushy and overgrown likely saved it from relic hunters , archaeologists said			1
some of the artifacts are on display at the @entity154 in @entity38 , about 40 miles south of the camp			1
the university museum recently purchased a letter written by cpl. @entity158 to his wife in @entity160 , @entity161			2
@entity158 , a member of the 1st @entity162 , wrote it only eight days before the camp was evacuated when @entity26 forces approached			2
@entity158 expresses hope that he will be part of a prisoner exchange between @entity26 and @entity98 forces and advises his wife , @entity170 , to consider selling the family cow to raise money			0
" i am here & shall get out some time & hope that will be soon , but do n't know , " @entity158 wrote			0
the horseman was shipped back to @entity143 and not paroled until late february 1865 , near war 's end			0
using modern technology along with shovels , prisoner drawings and topographic maps , @entity29 pinpointed the prisoner site and found a @entity185 cent of a type that was last manufactured in 1858 , six years before @entity17 opened			1
nails and other items showed that the sloped camp was the living area for nearly 10,000 men who built shelters and lean - tos near @entity17			1
having just survived the scorching 1864 summer , they dug into the earth to shelter them from a cold winter , which included a november snowfall			0
then , suddenly , in late november 1864 , the camp was abandoned			0
the prisoners were taken to other camps , including back to @entity143 , as the @entity2 approached during the famous @entity202			0
archaeologists think that prisoners may have been taken to the depot in @entity10 in the middle of the night , and were forced to leave behind their camp belongings and thousands of keepsakes from their homes up north			0
between 725 and 1,330 men died at the prison camp in the six weeks it existed			0
officials said they know the " general vicinity " of soldier graves , but have no plans to disturb them			0
conditions in northern pow camps often were n't much better			0
about 3,000 imprisoned @entity220 , for example , died in @entity221 , @entity161			0
" some of the saddest part of our history was the handling of prisoners on both sides , " @entity222 , professor emeritus of history at @entity224 in @entity225 , told @entity0 last year			0
there are no known photos of @entity17 and few details of the stockade , but a @entity26 mapmaker painted watercolors of the prison			0
he also kept a 5,000 - page journal that included descriptions of the misery at the camp			0
" the weather has been rainy and cold at nights , " pvt. @entity244 , who was previously imprisoned at @entity143 , wrote in his diary on november 1			0
" many prisoners have died from exposure , as not more than half of us have any shelter but a blanket propped upon sticks			0
... our rations have grown smaller in bulk too , and we have the same hunger as of old			0
" the land slipped into obscurity for about 70 years , when some of it became part of @entity17			0
until last year , a few entrenchments were the only signs of @entity17			0
that began to change in late june 2010 , when federal officials erected a locked and guarded fence to safeguard the artifacts found at its hatchery			1
they are working with their @entity11 counterparts to ensure the site is not touch by unauthorized individuals			1
some coins , tokens and other objects that have been found were made in @entity278 , and indicate @entity26 regiments made up of soldiers with @entity282 and @entity283 ancestry , @entity29 , 37 , said last year			1
@entity29 said the team wants to learn about daily life for @entity26 prisoners and their @entity98 keepers			0
" right now we are estimating the limits of the encampment and the prisoner occupation area , " he said wednesday			0
" we are going to continue exploring the @entity98 side			0
" he estimated less than 1 % of the site occupied by prisoners has been surveyed			1
" we are just getting our feet in the door , " said @entity29			0
" this is once in a lifetime			0

nearly 300 artifacts have been found in early archaeological *investigations*
the site is *unusual* in that it has not been picked over by relic hunters
some of the items are on display at @entity22 in @entity38
