it 's the hardest part			2
that 's the truth facing the loved ones of slain or missing @entity5			1
so when a 19 - year - old @entity7 woman already facing murder charges told a newspaper reporter that she 'd killed before -- over and over again , from @entity10 to @entity11 -- loved ones could n't help but sit up and take notice , said @entity14 , a spokeswoman for the @entity15			1
" anyone hands them the least glimmer of hope , they latch on to it , " she said			1
" the biggest difficulty for victims is they have no control , and they 're trying to regain some by doing something proactive			2
" murder suspect 's bombshell claims raise questions on sunday , the @entity30 newspaper in @entity31 , @entity7 , published a jailhouse interview with murder suspect @entity33 in which she claimed a string of killings dating back six years -- to when she was 13			1
" i would lure these people in , " the @entity30 quoted her as saying			0
i learned them and even became their friend			0
i did this to people who did bad things and did n't deserve to be here anymore			0
" @entity47 took credit for more than 22 but fewer than 100 killings , @entity30 reporter @entity49 told @entity0 affiliate @entity51			1
authorities have n't verified her claims , although they are investigating			1
@entity47 and her husband , @entity33 , 22 , do face murder charges in the 2013 death of 42 - year - old @entity57 , who police say was strangled and repeatedly stabbed by the couple before being dumped in a yard			1
if her other claims are true , @entity47 would be one of the nation 's most prolific serial killers			1
@entity64 , known as the @entity65 , pleaded guilty to killing 49 women in @entity67 in the 1980s and 1990s			0
@entity68 may have killed as many as 65 young men in the 1970s and early 1980s			2
based on the numbers she gave @entity49 , @entity47 would have had to kill on average somewhere between every three weeks and every three months			0
yet in the 2013 killing , police documents show @entity47 told police she and her husband could n't clean up all the blood @entity57 's killing left in her @entity78 , and that one of the ways investigators traced the killing to her was her own cell phone			1
the last number dialed on @entity85 's phone led to @entity47 , according to police			1
even the prosecutor who hopes to convict the couple , @entity90 district attorney @entity89 , said he discounts @entity47 's other claims			1
" we have been in contact with other law enforcement agencies where she has lived and have n't received any information verifying what she said , " @entity89 told @entity51			2
that means little to loved ones of victims clinging to a desperate need for answers -- and there are plenty of people in that situation			1
the @entity108 estimates more than 87,000 people were missing in the @entity5 at the end of 2012			2
and in just the last five years , more than 26,000 killings have gone unsolved			0
in @entity11 , where @entity47 and her husband lived before moving to @entity7 , advocates for families of missing persons and crime victims have already heard from some people asking about possible links to the case			1
" anytime anything like this happens , we start getting e-mails and phone calls			0
i started getting texts last night , " said @entity125 , the founder of the @entity127 - based @entity126 for @entity128			0
" it sends everybody into a panic mode -- a hopeful panic mode , " @entity125 said			0
" they want to be one of those , but they do n't want to be one of those			0
they want their nightmare to end			0
" some people , those whose loved ones are still missing , take notice of such cases not out of hope the trail will lead to a dead body , @entity14 said			1
instead , they want to keep hope alive			0
by finding out that a professed killer 's claims are false , they can continue believing their loved one is still alive , she said			1
and most of the time , stories such as @entity47 's do turn out to be concoctions , retired @entity108 investigator @entity156 told @entity0			2
" a lot of these individuals , particular some of the adult survivors , have emotional and psychological problems , and a lot of their motivation is to get attention and forgiveness for various problems in their lives , " he said			0
some just want to try to cash in on a fragile connection to a case in hopes of working themselves out of trouble with the law , said @entity14			0
whatever their motivation , it ends up leaving victims hurt all over again , @entity14 said			0
" when you ca n't get any of those pieces to fall into place , it 's very hard , " she said			0
woman accused in @entity183 slaying tells newspaper : i 've killed lots of others @entity0 's @entity188 contributed to this report .			2
