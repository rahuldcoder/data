-- @entity1 held his nerve to maintain the lead on day three of the @entity4 at the @entity5 in @entity6 and will take a slender one shot cushion into sunday 's final round			1
the @entity9 , who is attempting to win his third straight tournament and second major of 2014 , carded a round of 67 saturday to leave him on 13 - under - par for the week			2
@entity15 's @entity14 is a shot back at 12 - under - par followed by @entity17 on 11 - under			1
@entity18 finished the day at 10 - under - par alongside @entity19 while @entity20 , @entity21 , @entity22 and @entity23 are tied for fifth position at nine - under - par. " i 'm really happy with how i finished again , " @entity1 told @entity25 upon reaching the clubhouse			1
" i finished really strongly which puts me in good position for tomorrow			0
" @entity1 won the @entity29 in july and reclaimed the world no. 1 spot last week when he picked up the @entity32 title			1
and his big - hitting game seemed made for the tender greens in @entity35 that had been softened by early morning rain			0
but the day was not without its challenges and @entity1 had to dig deep to fend off the chasing field			1
the 25 - year - old saved par on the fourth after teeing off into the hazard before carding birdies on holes five and seven			0
he bogeyed eight and then once again showed guile to par the ninth when he overshot the green			0
a birdie on ten was then followed by a bogey on 12 and another difficult par save on 13			0
at this stage day , @entity17 and @entity22 had clawed @entity1 back to tie for the lead at 10 - under - par. but the @entity1 of the last month has been nothing if not resilient			1
he spoke friday about how golf has become his life since splitting from fiance @entity56 in may			0
and when the pressure was on here in @entity6 , he excelled			0
a birdie on 15 was followed by a miraculous approach shot on 16 that dropped two feet from the hole			2
three birdies from @entity14 on the final three holes , however , brought the @entity15 level atop the leaderboard			1
but @entity1 added one last birdie of his own on 18 to secure the overnight lead			1
" i knew there were guys ahead of me making birdies and it gives me a lot of confidence knowing that if i get challenged and people put the pressure on i am able to respond like i did today , " @entity1 said			1
" if i can keep playing well and staying mentally strong , there is another major to maybe come my way			0
" by comparison , @entity14 will be aiming for his first ever major win when he heads out sunday			1
the 28 - year - old is ranked 70 in the world and had only ever made the cut once in five previous majors			0
" i played beautifully today , i did n't miss a lot of shots , set up a few nice opportunities on the last few holes especially			0
i 'm very proud of myself the way i played , " @entity14 said in quotes carried by @entity92 news agency , the @entity91			1
" it 's a completely new situation for me , only my second cut in a major in six attempts , so i am quite a rookie in this particularly situation			2
i have driven it really nicely this week and if i can do it again it will settle down the nerves and i am going to have fun tomorrow			0
" elsewhere on the course , former world no. 1 @entity104 scored a fine 66 to leave him tied at seven - under par with @entity107 , @entity108 , @entity109 and @entity110			0
@entity112 ' @entity111 is a shot ahead at 8 - under - par after scoring an impressive 66 alongside @entity114 and @entity115			2
at the other end of the leaderboard , @entity117 's frustrating form continued as he scored a disappointing round of 73 leaving him two - over - par for the tournament .			2

@entity1 takes slim lead into final day of @entity4
@entity92 @entity29 winner holds one shot *advantage* over @entity15 's @entity14
@entity17 , @entity19 and @entity18 all in chasing pack
