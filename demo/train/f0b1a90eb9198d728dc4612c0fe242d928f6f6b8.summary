" he lied to agents when he could have helped			0
he concealed when he could have assisted			0
it is a crime to lie to law enforcement agents , and that is why @entity0 was charged and why the jury found him guilty today			1
but this case also reminds us that our public safety network relies on every citizen in the commonwealth			0
" defense attorneys @entity40 and @entity42 said their client will appeal the verdict			0
" basically ... the jury found that he was present in the room while others did what they did in this case , " @entity42 said			2

" i do n't believe that @entity0 has ever been more angry at a person than he was at @entity1 when @entity0 found out that @entity1 did what he did in this case , " @entity42 said after the verdict			1
" he was absolutely mortified			0
it was an unbelievable feeling of shock and betrayal that somebody that he knew could commit such atrocious and horrible acts			0
" police believe @entity1 and his older brother , @entity67 -- who was killed by police after the attacks -- set off the two bombs near the race 's finish line			2

his attorneys said that @entity0 was under tremendous pressure when he was interrogated and did n't have a lawyer at the time to help him			2
@entity27 ' presence on campus that night is a case of " sheer coincidence and bad luck , " the defense lawyers said			0
@entity0 was living with his mother , an @entity90 who immigrated to the @entity8 in the 1980s and is now employed as a social worker			0
in july , a federal jury found another friend of @entity1 's guilty of obstructing the investigation into the attack			1
