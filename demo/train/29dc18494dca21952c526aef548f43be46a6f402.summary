-- @entity2 students and supporters of head football coach @entity4 rallied tuesday evening outside his home amid growing calls for him to resign related to his response to child sex abuse allegations brought against a former assistant			1
the crowd in @entity12 , mostly young people , greeted and cheered @entity4 hours after his weekly news conference was canceled			2
speaking outside and from a window at his residence , the 84 - year - old @entity16 legend said he was praying for victims in the case			2
@entity4 , a longtime coach with a largely spotless record , is under pressure because of his response to allegations brought to him in 2002 by a graduate assistant who said he had seen retired defensive coordinator @entity26 sexually assaulting a young boy in the shower at the campus football complex			1
@entity4 reported the allegations to his boss , and @entity33 's attorney general said it appeared that the coach had met his obligations under state law			1
still , some critics have said that he should have reported the suspected abuse to police			0
" we do n't yet know who is legally guilty , " @entity42 columnist @entity41 wrote on the website			0
" but several prominent employees at the state university are morally guilty			0
and one of them is @entity4			2
" on tuesday , @entity4 's son , @entity50 , said on @entity51 that reports in the @entity52 , citing people briefed on the matter , that university officials were planning an end to @entity4 's 46 - year coaching tenure were " premature			1
" " no discussions about retirement with @entity62 , " @entity4 said , using his father 's initials			1
he said the decision to cancel the news conference was not his father 's			0
" due to the ongoing legal circumstances centered around the recent allegations and charges , we have determined that today 's press conference can not be held and will not be rescheduled , " the university said in a statement			1
@entity4 said tuesday afternoon that he hopes to hold another news conference soon			2
" i know you guys have a lot of good questions , and i 'd like to answer them , but i ca n't do it now , " @entity4 said after practice			2
a preliminary hearing for @entity26 , originally set for wednesday , has been rescheduled for december 7 , officials said tuesday afternoon			1
@entity26 's attorney has said more time was needed to bring in witnesses			1
on sunday , @entity2 announced that two university officials accused by state authorities of failing to report suspected abuse had stepped down , one of them returning to retirement and the other taking administrative leave			1
attorney general @entity91 said monday that the alleged failure of @entity2 athletic director @entity93 , 57 , and @entity94 , 62 , the university 's senior vice president for finance and business , to report abuse claims " likely allowed a child predator to continue to victimize children for many , many years			1
" @entity93 and @entity100 , who are each charged with one count of perjury and one count of failure to report suspected abuse , were released monday on $ 75,000 bail each			1
at the arraignment hearing , their attorneys said the men were innocent of the charges and would fight to clear their names			0
@entity26 is accused of sexual offenses , child endangerment and " corruption of a minor " charges involving eight boys , most or all of whom he met through the @entity120 , the charity he founded to help troubled youth , according to prosecutors			2
@entity26 's involvement with the group provided him with " access to hundreds of boys , many of whom were vulnerable due to their social situations , " the grand jury said			1
the former coach is said to have engaged in fondling , oral sex and anal sex with young boys over at least 15 years , according to the investigative grand jury 's summary of testimony			0
a source with direct knowledge of the investigation confirmed to @entity0 's @entity142 that a man walked into a @entity145 , @entity33 , state police station and claimed he was victimized by @entity26			1
interviews with the man will determine whether he 's a ninth victim , the source said			0
@entity26 , who served 23 years as defensive coordinator for the @entity16 football team before retiring in 1999 , is free on $ 100,000 bail			2
his attorney , @entity151 , has not returned a message from @entity0 seeking comment			0
overheard on @entity0 about @entity4 the grand jury investigation that led to the charges began with the claims of one alleged victim who said @entity26 had " indecently assaulted " him and engaged in sex acts while he was a guest at the coach 's home , according to the attorney general			1
the victim met @entity26 through the @entity120 , and @entity26 allegedly used expensive gifts such as trips to professional and college games , golf clubs , a computer and money , @entity91 said			0
the relationship , which began in 2005 and lasted into 2008 , included overnight stays at @entity26 's home , where touching led to sexual acts , according to @entity91 and grand jury testimony			1
however , the most explosive charges in the grand jury report involve a 2002 incident in which a graduate student reported seeing @entity26 in the shower performing anal sex on a young boy , according to the grand jury and prosecutors			2
" one of the most compelling and disturbing pieces of testimony in this investigation came from an eyewitness to a late - night sexual assault that allegedly occurred in march of 2002 , in the locker room of the @entity191 on the @entity192 , " @entity91 said			0
" hearing what sounded like sexual activity in the showers of a building that was supposed to be empty , a graduate assistant reportedly observed @entity26 sexually assaulting a naked boy who appeared to be about 10 years old			2
" the assistant reported the incident to @entity4 , who in turn alerted @entity93			0
@entity4 said in his statement that he had done his duty in informing @entity93			0
" it was obvious that the witness was distraught over what he saw , but he at no time related to me the very specific actions contained in the grand jury report			0
regardless , it was clear that the witness saw something inappropriate involving mr. @entity26			0
as coach @entity26 was retired from our coaching staff at that time , i referred the matter to university administrators , " @entity4 said			1
but instead of reporting the incident to authorities , @entity93 and @entity100 took @entity26 's locker room keys and banned him from having children from @entity120 visit the football building , @entity91 said			1
in his statement , @entity4 called the charges " shocking			0
" " while i did what i was supposed to with the one charge brought to my attention , like anyone else involved , i ca n't help but be deeply saddened these matters are alleged to have occurred , " he said in the statement			0
prosecutors have not ruled out the possibility of additional charges or victims in the case			0
@entity0 's @entity142 and @entity236 contributed to this report .			0
