-- two months after a nationwide manhunt helped authorities track down kidnapped @entity4 teen @entity3 , she 's revealing new details about her conversations with the man who allegedly held her hostage and killed her mother and brother			1
in an interview with @entity15 's " today " show broadcast thursday morning , @entity12 described the moment she says she realized family friend @entity3 was kidnapping her in early august			1
he had just picked her up from cheerleading practice and took her to his home about an hour east of @entity20 -- apparently , she said she 'd eventually learn , with her mom and brother hidden somewhere inside			2
@entity12 says @entity3 sat her down on a couch , handcuffed her , zip - tied her feet and revealed his plan to kidnap her and drive her to @entity26			1
the day quickly took an even darker turn , @entity12 said , when @entity3 encouraged her to play @entity29 roulette with him , using a real gun			1
" when it was my turn , i started crying and , like , was freaking out , " @entity12 said			2
" and he said , ' do you want to play ? ' and i said , ' no , ' and i started crying , and he 's like , ' ok , ' and he stopped			2
" @entity12 said @entity3 told her that her mother , @entity34 , 42 , and her brother @entity35 , 8 , were elsewhere in the house , alive			1
@entity12 , 16 , said that she could hear @entity35			2
" i heard him trying to yell upstairs , but he was gagged , so i could n't do anything to help him , " @entity12 said			1
" i was yelling his name			0
i could n't do anything			0
" she said after about two to three hours , @entity3 drugged her -- with @entity41 , she thinks -- and when she woke up , she found herself in @entity26 with him			1
that 's when he told her , she said , that her mother and @entity35 still were in the house 's garage , and that he had set a timer that would ignite a fire at the home , many hours after @entity3 and @entity12 had left			1
@entity3 told her that he had left signs that would indicate to responding firefighters -- before the fire reached the garage -- where @entity34 and @entity35 were , @entity3 told " today			2
" authorities would eventually find the remains of @entity34 in the burned garage and @entity35 's body in another part of the home			1
@entity34 was struck at least 12 times in the head ; her right arm and both legs were fractured , and she had a cut on her neck , an autopsy revealed			0
the woman 's ankles were bound by a plastic cable tie , and duct tape was wrapped around her neck and mouth , her autopsy report said			0
@entity35 was burned beyond recognition			0
it was believed , according to the autopsy , that the boy died because of the fire			0
after evading authorities for a week , horseback riders spotted @entity3 and @entity3 in the @entity26 wilderness , nearly 1,000 miles from where the alleged kidnapping occurred			1
@entity12 said @entity3 told her he 'd kill the riders if she spoke to them			1
@entity3 spoke to them , and they left , she said			2
but those riders , feeling something was amiss and learning that an @entity87 had been issued , contacted authorities			0
when law enforcement teams closed in on the two august 10 , @entity3 was shot dead by an @entity91 agent and @entity12 was taken to a hospital			1
recalling the moments before the shooting , @entity12 told " today " that she and @entity3 were by a fire , which she said he 'd set in an effort to signal for help			1
she did n't say why he was trying to signal for assistance			0
she said she told him that she 'd read in a book that firing a gun three times in the air also was a signal for help			0
so , she said , @entity12 fired a gun once in the air , and then a second time -- but with a lowered aim			1
" then a bunch of guns went off			0
i looked and he fell on the ground , " she said			0
" i kind of looked over , and i was like , ' are you ok ? ' and then a bunch of , like , the @entity91 people came out , telling me to get down			0
" @entity12 said she was told the next day , in the hospital , that her mother , her brother and @entity3 were dead			1
with tears , @entity12 said she greatly missed her mother and brother			1
" sometimes it 's like i wait for them to get home , and then they 're not there , " she said			2
the nationwide manhunt for @entity3 drew widespread attention and sparked intense speculation about the case			2
now , the author of a new book is criticizing the teen 's behavior and claiming there are inconsistencies in her story , @entity0 affiliate @entity130 reported			0
an @entity139 spokeswoman told @entity0 the family has no comment on the book			0
addressing letters between @entity12 and @entity3 that authorities found in his burned home , @entity12 told " today " that she had been writing to @entity3 , a family friend , because her mother and father had split up			1
" me and my mom really did n't get along a year ago , so when i was having problems with her and i would n't have really anyone to talk about it with , me and him , instead of talking face to face if we did n't have time ... we 'd just write letters back and forth , talking about , like , the situation and how to get through it , " she said			0
her father , @entity12 , told " today " that he and his daughter are working through the ordeal			0
" we 're getting help and talking with each other and trying to be strong ( and ) moving forward , " he said			0
