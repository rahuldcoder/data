it seemed as if billionaire @entity1 apparently did n't have enough money left after buying apartments , cars and dresses for @entity6 to pay for appropriate legal or communications advice before his exclusive interview with @entity10 's @entity9			1
we do n't know for sure , but that 's the only conclusion one can draw from the @entity15 owner 's disastrous attempt at exoneration that aired monday night on " @entity17			0
" @entity1 broke just about every rule of crisis communications during his taped and edited interview with @entity9 , starting with issuing an obviously half - hearted apology for his racially offensive remarks surreptitiously recorded by @entity6 during a private discussion			1
channeling @entity24 , @entity25 three times declared unconvincingly " i am not a racist , " when fumbling for an explanation for why he ranted in an audio recording about his disapproval of @entity6 being seen with black men at @entity15 home basketball games			0
" twenty - five percent of my whole game are black people and i love them			2
i ca n't explain some of the stupid , foolish uneducated words that i uttered			0
" opinion : @entity25 apology was an epic fail the interview went downhill from there , with @entity1 rambling from subject to subject , with no apparent goal except to somehow look sympathetic to viewers			1
here are some of the most important rules of crisis communications he broke during his time on camera : 1			2
apologize sincerely , then move on to say what you are doing to ensure the transgression never happens again			1
announce that you are entering rehabilitation , meeting with the group you have offended to make amends or taking sensitivity training			1
but you must demonstrate that you are taking concrete steps to correct your future behavior			0
@entity1 apologized to his 29 fellow @entity60 franchise owners and to commissioner @entity61 , yet he neglected to say what he would do to improve			1
whether you are wealthy or not , you must give something up as a gesture of your commitment to seek forgiveness from the people you have offended			1
if you offend the @entity75 - @entity74 community , a generous contribution of money and your personal time to an inner - city charity may be in order			0
if you offend a religious group , a donation to a church or charitable group is appropriate			0
and the bigger the offense , the larger the gift should be			0
in @entity1 's case , we 're probably talking millions of dollars and hundreds of hours			1
ask forgiveness of those whom you have offended			1
@entity1 assumed that @entity60 players , owners , fans and everyone in @entity74 would understand his plight and give him a pass because he is a well - intentioned 80 - year - old billionaire with a big mouth			1
he skipped a major step when he forgot to even ask			0
never blame others for the crisis you have created			1
first , @entity1 claimed @entity6 baited him into making his racially offensive comments			2
then he said she was n't really a bad person and moved on to gratuitously criticize @entity101 , philanthropist and businessman @entity103			0
" what does he do for the black people ? he does n't do anything			0
he made love to every girl in every city in @entity74 and he had @entity111 , " @entity1 said			2
" is he an example to children ? because he has money , he is able to treat himself			0
... he should fade into the background			0
" with these statements , @entity1 created another crisis for himself and for the @entity60			1
never blame the news media			2
@entity1 claimed that @entity60 players and owners still like him and that he has received " thousands of phone calls " of support from friends and colleagues			2
who then is attacking the @entity15 owner for his remarks ? " it 's the media that 's out to get me , " @entity1 said			1
@entity9 and every other journalist watching the interview or seeing the news reports afterward is now his foe , whether or not they were before he made that comment			0
appearing on @entity10 immediately after the jaw - dropping interview , african - american film maker @entity134 perhaps captured it best for all communications experts when he said of @entity25 : " why do they let him speak ? who 's around him ? " who indeed .			0

@entity143 : did anybody *counsel* @entity1 on how to behave in interview ?
@entity146 : apologize , then say how you 're going to ensure it never happens again
he says ask forgiveness ; then make a sacrifice or gesture for the people you offended
@entity143 : never blame others or the media for the crisis you have created
