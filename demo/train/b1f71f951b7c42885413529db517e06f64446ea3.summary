when it comes to racing the @entity4 's horses , one man is her majesty 's knight in shining armor			1
@entity7 is seemingly the @entity9 monarch 's jockey of choice and no wonder			1
the consensus is that the @entity13 is the best in the business , a view enhanced by his win at the prestigious @entity18 in november			0
however , he is quick to downplay his regular meetings with @entity4 , treating her like he would any other owner			0
" it 's not really different and it 's very easy to ride for her , " @entity7 told @entity2			1
" there 's no pressure			1
she 's just very easy going			1
riding for her is a great experience			1
" asked about the accolade of being the world 's most accomplished horseman , @entity7 brushes it aside			1
" i take those sorts of comments with a pinch of salt			0
i 'm just in a position to ride these great horses in these great races and i try to do as well as i can , " he says			2
" i do n't know who 's number one , it 's very hard to say			2
people will forever debate these sorts of things			0
" the 31 - year - old has won everything from the @entity46 to the @entity47 and ridden to victory all over the globe from @entity50 to @entity52 's @entity51			1
@entity7 says he 's lazy , that he 's lucky , but his peers say otherwise			1
brother @entity54 is a @entity55 jockey and likes to tell the story of how his brother turned down his first ride at the age of 16			2
while most youngsters would have jumped at the chance , @entity7 rejected it because he felt it had no chance of winning			1
the judgment of a rider labeled " a perfectionist " by his brother is clearly good -- he went on to win seven of his first 10 races			2
he is known to turn up early at a racecourse whatever the event to walk the course			0
he pores over races on television to learn all he can about upcoming rides or those he is up against			2
" you always have to be taking advantage of whatever information you can , " he says			0
" you want to ensure you 're not going to get stuck behind a horse that 's got no speed when it comes to the key moments in a race			2
" often best - laid plans go out the window , " he explained			2
" you do n't get a moment 's notice to think but any information you have -- however small -- is helpful so it 's always worth doing your homework			2
" born into a horse - racing family , dad @entity92 is a trainer and his three siblings -- two brothers and a sister -- are all jockeys			1
it 's as if he was born to sit in a saddle			2
football was the initial passion , the @entity99 fan had trials with @entity103 , who play in @entity13 football 's second tier			1
but his once regular kickabouts have been curtailed to the odd game with son @entity109 in the garden of the family home at @entity112 , the home of @entity13 racing			2
unsurprisingly , he picks out @entity114 as the @entity116 ' star performer but less because of his rush of goals than his " great work rate , " an attribute repeatedly leveled at @entity7 by his peers			1
football , though , remains something he gets mere snapshots of as he travels the globe riding the world 's best racehorses at the world 's best racecourses			1
surely , there must be a favorite ? " i do n't have a favorite place to ride , i just like to ride good horses			0
of my wins i suppose the @entity47 was the most important one for me because it 's a very difficult race to win			2
" and as for a favorite horse , it 's difficult to pick just one			0
there are a few i 've had more of a history with that stand out but i could n't pick just one			0
" last season alone , @entity7 celebrated 155 winners across the planet , although celebrated might not quite be the right word			1
@entity7 has been criticized by the @entity9 media for his surly ways in and out of the saddle , even his father once joked he was a " miserable bastard			1
" there are times he has celebrated -- he was all smiles after riding @entity154 to a famous victory in @entity156 -- but more often than not he has entered the winners enclosure with little fanfare			0
admittedly it is with good reason : " usually my work is n't done for the day and there 's another race to come moments later			0
i like to focus on that while i 'm still there and i do n't have time to worry about anything else			0
" even his son would like him to ooze greater enthusiasm			0
@entity109 's own hero being @entity172 , the outgoing jockey with the penchant to jump out of the saddle in celebration of victory			1
@entity109 loves @entity172 and , for that matter , dad does too , listing him alongside @entity179 and @entity180 as the jockeys he aspired to be like			0
but his idols , ironically , were more of the jump jockey variety , the likes of @entity185 and @entity186 despite the fact that @entity7 only had aspirations to ride on the flat			1
as a result , while his friends dreamed of growing big , @entity7 was ever hopeful he would remain small and remembers celebrating the fact he stopped growing at 5ft 7in			1
that he has achieved so much since the decision aged 17 to forgo his a-levels -- despite opposition from his mother -- sometimes leaves him bemused			0
" i did n't think i ever thought what i might achieve or how it might go , " he says			0
" you do n't think about those things at 17 or 18 , you just do what you 're doing			0
i was n't thinking about the future			0
" and i 've never been one to seek the limelight			0
that 's just the way i am			0
i 'm quite a quiet person			0
" with royal approval and an increasingly impressive cv , the limelight is inevitably on @entity7			1
in @entity52 , where he rides for two months of the year for example , he is met at airports and train stations by fans wanting photographs and autographs			0
but its not all glitz and glamor			0
it is common for him to fly around the world for a solitary race , racing in what is the equivalent of the middle of the night for him before flying straight back home			1
at least jet lag does n't have a chance to set in ... now is a rare quiet period of the year for the quiet man of racing			0
the next big meeting on the agenda is march 's @entity231			1
should @entity7 be victorious , do n't expect him to celebrate .			1

@entity7 is generally regarded as the finest jockey in flat racing in the world currently
a former footballer in his youth , the *diehard* @entity99 fan was a relative *latecomer* to riding
@entity7 is @entity9 monarch 's go - to jockey when it comes to big races
