-- the nation has struggled with addressing how best to reduce gun violence following last month 's tragic shooting in @entity4 , @entity5			1
responding to calls for gun control , the @entity6 attempted to shift blame for mass homicides away from guns to cultural influences such as video games or entertainment			1
no one can accuse the @entity6 of not being clever			2
at least not until it released a gun - themed shooting game less than a month after condemning the video game industry			1
in fairness , " @entity20 , " rated for ages 4 and up and free on the @entity23 and @entity24 , is no blood - soaked , first - person shooter game			1
the trailer shows that it allows the player to engage in target practice using realistic - looking weapons			0
one of the weapon options appears to be an @entity30 , the same weapon used at @entity4			0
the game also includes some gun safety tips			0
i have no objection to the game per se , although the @entity6 's app smacks of hypocrisy			1
releasing a gun - themed shooting video game a month after the @entity4 massacre reveals that the @entity6 does n't even take its own claims seriously			1
as for the @entity6 's assertion that games create violence , it is nakedly self - serving			1
but , as queasy as the whole thing is , violent video games do not cause more violence			1
several researchers , including myself , met with vice president @entity51 on friday to inform him that studies are unable to support the contention that violent video games contribute to societal violence			1
rather , it is untreated mental health symptoms that contribute to outcomes including youth violence , dating violence and bullying			0
as @entity61 aptly noted , nations that consume more video games per capita than the @entity64 such as @entity65 , or share our media culture almost identically such as @entity68 , have much lower violence rates than our country			1
that 's true even if you exclude gun violence and consider only simply assaults			0
and mass homicide perpetrators are no more likely to be gamers than the rest of us			0
our society experiences confirmation bias , focusing on video games when the shooter is a young male , and ignoring video games when the shooter is an older male such as 62 - year - old @entity85 , who shot two firefighters the week after the @entity87			2
this confirmation bias creates the false impression of a correlation where none exists			0
the @entity6 is apparently unaware that most theories of media effects make little distinction between a game such as " @entity20 " and one such as " @entity99 " according to such theories , seeing a picture of a gun or reading " @entity94 " is as likely to stimulate aggression as a blood - soaked movie or game			2
granted , the @entity64 @entity104 did n't buy that argument in 2011 when it considered a @entity107 law regulating the sale of violent games to minors , and criticized the quality of the research attempting to link violent games with aggression more broadly			2
i do n't believe either " @entity20 " or " @entity99 " harms minors , although of course some games may have morally objectionable content			2
but the @entity6 ca n't claim , " video games create mass killers			1
oh wait , hey , not this one ! " there are reasonable things we could do to reduce gun violence while respecting the rights of law - abiding citizens to own guns			0
for example , better and more consistent background checks and required reporting by mental health professionals when patients make violent threats ( requiring the removal of firearm licenses from those individuals ) would go a long way			0
we can also put out public health campaigns to warn people of the risks of gun ownership so they could make informed decisions of their own without their constitutional rights being violated			0
sensible changes will not occur if the nation indulges in a moral panic about violent video games as it did after the @entity151 massacre			2
this , undoubtedly , would be exactly what the @entity6 would like to see happen			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity156 .			0
