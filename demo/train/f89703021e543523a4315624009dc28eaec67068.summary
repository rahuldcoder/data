@entity0 , @entity1 -- opening a third week of testimony , a gun dealer said @entity6 athlete @entity5 had to know gun safety laws before purchasing his firearms and getting his gun licenses			1
@entity10 , who sold guns to @entity5 , said the athlete correctly answered a questionnaire			2
@entity10 said @entity5 knew that it 's not legal to shoot at unknown person seen breaking into your house , not legal to shoot at them if burglar bars separate you , but it is legal to shoot at them if there 's no protection and they approach you with a weapon			1
for it to be legal to fire , @entity10 said , " the attack must be against you , must be against a person , must be unlawful			0
" these points are important , because the @entity5 defense team must show that not only did he made a mistake but that the mistake was reasonable in order for him to be cleared of killing his girlfriend , @entity35			1
prosecutors and the defense are jockeying over whether @entity5 intentionally murdered @entity35 , or killed her in a terrible but understandable accident			2
there 's no question that he shot her through a bathroom door in his house early on @entity44 last year , hitting her with three hollow - tipped bullets , one of which probably killed her almost instantly			1
but for two weeks in court , his defense team has chipped away at every witness who casts doubt on his story that he thought @entity35 was a burglar and mistakenly acted in what he believed was self - defense			0
prosecutor @entity55 has put up witnesses ranging from the pathologist who performed the autopsy , to ex-girlfriend @entity59 , who said @entity5 kept a gun by his bed and went to investigate a sound in the night , weapon in hand , at least once while she was dating him			1
the senior police officer on the scene the night of the killing testified friday , but it 's not clear he did much for the prosecution case			1
the police investigation sounded in court like a catalog of bumbling , bad judgment , poor memory and petty theft			2
former police col. @entity77 described how he found a police ballistics expert handling @entity5 ' gun without wearing gloves and reprimanded the officer , who apologized and put a pair on			1
and he said he was " furious " when at least one of the @entity6 athlete 's valuable wristwatches disappeared from his bedroom as police investigated the crime scene			2
he " body searched " his fellow officers , their bags and their vehicles but was unable to find the watch , which was worth several thousand dollars			0
he also said he had ordered the bathroom door through which @entity5 shot @entity35 removed from the house , placed in a body bag and taken to his office , explaining , " the door is the most valuable evidence because the deceased was behind the door			1
" earlier in the week , the defense attacked police handling of the door , implying that the evidence was unreliable because it was contaminated			2
@entity107 resigned from the force in december after three decades , under fire for his handling of the door			0
asked what he now did for a living , he choked up and said , " i am now coaching sports , and sports is my life			0
" gory details lend @entity5 trial a ' csi ' flavor golden boy turned defendant he 's the 13th witness to testify for the prosecution in the murder trial of @entity5 , once @entity1 's golden boy for the stellar track success that made him the first double amputee runner to compete in the @entity127			1
@entity5 , 27 , has pleaded not guilty to murder and three other weapons charges			2
@entity35 , a model , was 29 when she was killed			0
on friday , @entity5 ' lawyer @entity131 ripped into @entity133 's chronology of events on the night of the killing , presenting witness statements from three police officers whose accounts differed from @entity77 's			1
the former officer was so startled by the statement of police sgt. @entity141 that he stared at @entity131 and said , " @entity143			0
" later , @entity131 rattled van @entity77 so severely , pointing out clear differences between two pictures that the former officer said were the same , that @entity77 refused to answer a question about how many keys were in another photograph			0
" it 's not a trick question , " @entity131 said			2
" there 's one key there			0
" gruesome images the former police colonel first took the stand thursday and said paramedics were there when he arrived at @entity5 ' address about 3:55 a.m. , but @entity35 was dead			1
as he testified , the prosecution showed more than 100 police photographs taken at @entity5 ' house after the killing , including the sprinter 's 9 mm handgun , still cocked and ready to fire , on a bloody towel or bathmat on a blood - spattered floor			1
on friday , the court was shown a photo of a toilet covered in blood , but only @entity133 saw photos of @entity35 's body and closeups of her injuries			2
those gruesome pictures were not displayed on courtroom monitors			0
even so , @entity5 kept his head down , shielding his eyes with one hand , while prosecutor @entity55 talked the former police officer quickly through the sheaf of photos on the witness stand			1
@entity5 vomited several times last week as pathologist @entity189 described @entity35 's fatal wounds , and again when pictures of the injuries were accidentally displayed on monitors in court			1
gun at his bedside the case against @entity5 is largely circumstantial , @entity55 said in his opening statement last week			1
@entity5 and @entity35 were the only people in his house when he killed her			2
@entity55 has been building a picture of what happened through the testimony of experts , neighbors who heard screaming and bangs that night , current and former friends of @entity5 ' and a security guard who sped to the scene because of reports of gunshots			1
many prosecution witnesses ' accounts are consistent with @entity5 ' version of events : that he got up in the night , went out to his balcony to get a fan , came back inside and heard noises in the bathroom that he thought came from an intruder			1
he said he took the gun and fired while calling for @entity35 to call police			2
when she did n't answer , he realized she could have been the person in the bathroom , he said			0
neighbors said they heard a woman screaming before the shots were fired			0
but the defense is proposing that what neighbors thought was @entity35 screaming in fear for her life was in fact @entity5 when he realized what he had done			0
and the defense says that the sounds neighbors heard were not the gunshots , but the cricket bat hitting the door as he tried to rescue her			0
@entity5 and at least two neighbors made phone calls to security after the shooting , allowing the defense to use phone records to establish a timeline of events			0
judge @entity245 will decide the verdict			1
@entity1 does not have jury trials			1
in @entity1 , premeditated murder carries a mandatory life sentence with a minimum of 25 years			0
@entity5 also could get five years for each gun indictment and 15 years for a firearms charge he also faces			1
if he is n't convicted of premeditated murder , the sprinter could face a lesser charge of culpable homicide , a crime based on negligence			0
the sentence for culpable homicide is at the judge 's discretion			0
the trial looks set to go on for several more weeks			0
@entity2 's @entity264 contributed to this report			0

new : dealer says @entity268 knew gun safety laws
@entity5 shot his girlfriend to death last year ; the question in court is whether it was intentional
last week , former police colonel 's testimony did little to help prosecution case
judge @entity245 will decide the verdict ; @entity1 does not have jury trials .
