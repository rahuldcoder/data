@entity0 -- @entity3 's accused rioters are facing the courts in growing numbers , as the streets remain quiet and the police continue their efforts to bring all those responsible for rampaging through @entity0 and other cities to justice			1
more than 1,900 people have been arrested and about half that number charged , the majority in the capital -- and the front pages of @entity3 newspapers are filled with the accounts of those hauled up in court , many during special overnight sessions			1
the violence first broke out in north @entity0 's @entity23 neighborhood after a protest over the death of a local man , @entity27 , who prime minister @entity28 said was shot by police , and spread on successive nights across @entity0 and other cities			1
but after two nights of relative calm , much of the nation 's attention has turned to what happens next for those caught -- and what the fallout from the disorder may be for @entity3 society			0
several newspapers highlight the case of 18 - year - old @entity44 , who appeared in court in @entity46 on thursday , reporting that she was picked to be a @entity48 " ambassador " tasked with welcoming guests to the capital during next year 's games			0
but a @entity53 spokeswoman said friday that @entity55 " is not a @entity48 ambassador and never has been			0
we believe she was actually a youth ambassador for the @entity58 borough			0
" ives was allegedly captured on video hurling bricks at a police car and was reported to police by her parents after they spotted her on a television news bulletin			2
she denied charges of burglary , violent disorder and attacking a police car , the @entity69 newspaper reported			2
the @entity69 also highlights the cases of an 11 - year - old girl who pleaded guilty to criminal damage in @entity78 and a 12 - year - old boy who admitted taking a bottle of wine from a @entity83 supermarket			0
as thoughts turn to the weekend ahead , deputy prime minister @entity84 , speaking in @entity78 , warned prospective troublemakers against stirring up more unrest , saying they should " think again			1
" home secretary @entity89 announced that a march planned for saturday by the @entity91 , a far - right group , had been banned			0
" it is clear that a ban is needed to ensure communities and property are protected , " she said in a statement friday			0
a significant number of officers would be deployed in the town of @entity100 , 30 miles west of @entity101 , to police any @entity91 presence , she added			1
in @entity101 , where three young men were killed in a hit - and - run incident in the early hours of wednesday , community groups are planning a " peace rally " for sunday with the aim of promoting unity , @entity103 said			1
londoners can expect the " surge " of 16,000 police officers deployed since tuesday to remain on the city 's streets through the weekend , prime minister @entity28 said thursday			1
the huge deployment comes against a backdrop of questions over @entity3 's policing approach and as lawmakers raise the prospect that new powers could be granted to police to tackle future unrest			2
@entity28 told lawmakers at an emergency session of @entity126 on thursday that police in @entity0 had waited too long to begin arresting rioters after unrest broke out saturday			1
" what became increasingly clear earlier this week was that there were simply far too few police deployed onto the streets			2
and the tactics they were using were n't working , " he said			0
" police chiefs have been frank with me about why this happened			2
initially , the police treated the situation too much as a public order issue rather than essentially one of crime			2
" this week 's apparently orchestrated looting -- which occurred in different places at the same time -- presented " a new and unique challenge , " but police had ultimately changed their approach , he told lawmakers			2
officers are now being given more tools to tackle disorder , @entity28 said , with " every contingency " being looked at , including greater powers to ask suspected troublemakers to remove their masks			1
the government may also consider measures to prevent troublemakers from using social media to coordinate disorder , he said			0
@entity28 promised a thorough inquiry into @entity163 's death saturday but said it did not justify the ensuing violence			1
what started as a peaceful demonstration in front of the police department by community members and @entity163 's relatives and friends was " used as an excuse by opportunist thugs in gangs , first in @entity23 itself , then across @entity0 and then in other cities , " he said			1
" it is completely wrong to say there is any justifiable causal link			0
" the august 4 shooting occurred when officers from a police unit that deals with gun crime in the black community stopped a cab carrying the 29 - year - old father of four in the working - class , predominantly @entity190 district of @entity23 , the @entity181 said			1

@entity217 , who the @entity204 said was assaulted after he tried to stamp out a fire set by rioters , was the fifth person thought to have died in connection with the disorder			0
the force said friday that three of the latest suspects to be charged included a 19 - year - old man who is believed to have posted a picture on @entity228 posing with a haul of suspected stolen goods and two teenage girls charged with counts including robbery , attempted robbery and possession of a knife			2

another man died after being found shot in a car in @entity281 , south @entity0 , on monday night			1
the violence comes against a backdrop of austerity measures and budget cuts			0
but @entity28 , community leaders and police have repeatedly pointed to a criminal , rather than political , motivation for the looting			1
analysts say a mix of economic and social tensions has been at play in the unrest , with deprivation a key factor			0
those seen taking part in rioting and looting have been from diverse ethnic backgrounds and span a wide range of ages , and many are young			0
