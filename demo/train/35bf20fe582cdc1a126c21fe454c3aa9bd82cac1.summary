-- the @entity1 on monday upheld the conviction of a man who bought a handgun but broke the law by not disclosing his intent to resell it to a relative			1
it was a rare setback for gun - rights advocates who contend government efforts to track and keep firearms out of the wrong hands go too far			1
the court ruled 5 - 4 in the " straw " purchase case against @entity16 , a former police officer who told a @entity18 gun dealer in 2009 that he was the " actual buyer " of the @entity21 weapon			1
he then sold it to his uncle in @entity26 for $ 400			2
@entity16 said he and his relative were legally able to own it			0
but he was charged with making false statements , convicted and sentenced to probation			2
at issue is whether such misstatements are " material " to an otherwise lawful sale and whether that kind of information should be kept by a federally licensed dealer			2
the @entity38 administration said those who purchase from licensed dealers must follow the letter and spirit of the law to ensure accurate record - keeping and to make it easier to trace the weapon			1
gun rights advocates call @entity16 a victim of vast government overreach , unfairly lumped into the same category as those who would buy weapons for criminals or for smuggling			2
the high court in recent years has affirmed the broader individual right of @entity57 to own handguns for self - protection in the home			0
and on this issue , it narrowly ruled for the stricter control , saying the " actual transferee / buyer " must disclose any intent to resell at the time of purchase			1
" no piece of information is more important under federal firearms law than the identity of a gun 's purchaser , " justice @entity68 said , stressing that the dealer in this case could never have known to run a background check on @entity16 's uncle			1
she was supported in her opinion by justices @entity80 , @entity82 , @entity83 , and @entity84			0
federal law requires prospective buyers to check a box on an @entity89 and @entity90 form indicating whether they are purchasing a gun for someone else			1
@entity16 confirmed he was the buyer , but said he made clear all along that he planned to sell the weapon legally to his uncle was told the transfer could be completed by a licensed dealer , which he completed days later			0
during oral arguments in january , some justices questioned whether signing the @entity102 form really solved the problem of keeping weapons out of the hands of the wrong people			1
in his dissent justice @entity107 said the law in question was unclear			0
" the court ( majority ) makes it a crime for one lawful gun owner to buy a gun for another lawful gun owner , " he said			0
" whether or not that is a sensible result , the statutes @entity118 enacted do not support it			0
" @entity107 was backed by chief justice @entity120 and justices @entity121 and @entity123 .			0

former police officer convicted of buying a gun for an uncle but not saying so
federal law aimed at *transparency* in gun sales to keep them out of the wrong hands
@entity1 ruled narrowly , supports @entity38 administration position on the issue
