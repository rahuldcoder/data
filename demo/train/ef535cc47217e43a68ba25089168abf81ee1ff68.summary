-- criminal suspects claimed embattled @entity3 mayor @entity2 tried to buy a damaging video -- months before a tape was publicized showing him smoking crack -- according to court documents released wednesday			1
the documents obtained from @entity10 crown counsel @entity9 are tied to a @entity12 investigation into organized crime called @entity14			1
@entity15 was n't the focus of this investigation , and he has not been charged with a crime			2
but , after allegedly interacting with several players who were involved in the probe , he ended up getting ensnared in it			0
the mayor 's camp did not immediately return a @entity0 request for comment wednesday night on the latest allegations			2
according to the documents , police translating a march 27 phone conversation primarily from the @entity30 language believed that the men were talking about " receiving an offer from @entity2 in exchange for a video			1
" the men discussed an apparent offer of $ 5,000 and a car in exchange for the video , as well as selling the tape to the @entity41 newspaper and an unnamed website			2
the court documents state : " at the end of the discussion , ( one of the men ) said he does not want to go to the media but would just see him ( believed to be referring to @entity15 ) , ... he says he 'll ask for 100 or 150 " -- possibly referring to $ 100,000 or $ 150,000			2
these conversations do n't delve into specifics about what 's on the video			0
but earlier this year , allegations surfaced in two media outlets that @entity15 had been recorded last winter using crack cocaine			2
in may , the @entity59 and the website @entity58 published stories saying their reporters saw 90 seconds of a cell - phone video showing @entity15 , as the @entity59 described it , " inhaling from what appears to be a glass crack pipe			1
" later in the video -- as described by @entity59 -- an " incoherent " man both the @entity59 and @entity58 claimed was @entity15 ranted on a number of subjects			1
after that report came out , @entity2 said he no reason to resign			0
yet pressure on him increased earlier this fall when the @entity12 city 's police chief announced investigators had recovered a video that purportedly showed @entity15 smoking a crack pipe			1
the next week , on november 5 , @entity2 admitted that he 'd " smoked crack cocaine ... probably in one of my drunken stupors , probably approximately about a year ago			0
" he denied being an addict			0
@entity2 says he did n't lie about crack use even after this admission , @entity15 refused to resign			1
instead he vowed " outright war " on the city council when , later in the month , it slashed the mayor 's budget and transferred most of his duties to the deputy mayor			0
" if you think @entity98 - style politics is nasty , you guys have just attacked @entity99 , " @entity2 said then to groans and laughter in the city council chambers			0
the mayor 's voice is less apparent in the documents released wednesday , although he is not necessarily insignificant			0
@entity3 mayor 's rant caught on video authorities say that phone intercepts from early on april 20 , for instance , indicate one woman telling a man " that @entity2 is at the residence			1
" two minutes later , at 12:54 a.m. , another man allegedly tells the first " to go to @entity115 's ... house to deliver drugs to @entity2 , " the court documents say			1
one of the men says around 2:18 a.m. that @entity15 was doing drugs , and that the other man " told him to take a picture of that because of what it would be worth , " according to the official account			0
" ( this other man ) says that the mayor of the @entity128 @entity2 was smoking his rocks today , " police said of another phone conversation from shortly before 6 a.m. that april morning			1
later that day , @entity15 was out helping clean up a city park			0
he was without his cell phone , the documents said , citing remarks by the mayor 's staff , with indications that he had either left it or had it taken by those people he 'd been with hours before			0
@entity3 mayor 's tv show canceled			2

@entity3 's mayor has been *dogged* by drug allegations , has lost much of his power
new court docs say that he had interactions with targets of a probe into organized crime
one target said @entity15 had made an offer " in exchange for a video , " according to police
a man claimed " @entity2 was smoking rocks , " police say of an intercepted phone call
