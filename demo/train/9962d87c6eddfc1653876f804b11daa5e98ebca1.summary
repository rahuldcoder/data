@entity1 's restaurants in many @entity3 cities have been eerily quiet this past week			1
the fast food giant is enormously popular in @entity3 where it has 2,000 outlets , each one typically overflowing with hungry crowds			1
but many @entity1 's addicts have been forced to go cold turkey as numerous branches have yanked flagship burgers off the menu amid a tainted meat scandal			1
the food scare broke when a video surfaced in @entity3 media last week , showing appalling practices in a @entity19 food - processing factory that supplies ingredients to many international restaurant brands			2
since then , the tainted meat supply has been found to reach across @entity3 , all the way to @entity24 , and even to @entity25			2
how was the scandal uncovered ? a reporter from a @entity19 broadcaster secretly filmed inside the food processing plant of @entity30 , a subsidiary of @entity32 - based food supply giant @entity31			0
the footage captured workers handling food with their bare hands			0
several scenes showed them picking up meat that had fallen on the floor and returning it directly into the processing machine			0
one worker , his face concealed behind a surgical mask , turned to the camera and stated , " foul meat , " referring to the meat being handled			0
@entity48 ( @entity49 ) subsequently investigated the factory and found that expired beef and chicken products were processed and repackaged with new expiration dates			2
amongst the tainted products , they were able to trace forged production dates on more than 4,300 cases of smoked beef patties , with more than 3,000 cases already sold			0
who was affected ? @entity61 had been supplying chicken and beef products to branches of @entity1 's , @entity65 's , @entity66 , @entity67 , @entity68 , and @entity69 in several cities in @entity3			1
since the scandal broke , all the brands have cut ties with @entity61 's parent company @entity31 , except for @entity1 's			1
the golden arches will continue to work with the food supplier in @entity3 , eventually shifting to a @entity77 food plant in @entity79 province , which was described as the " newest state - of - the - art facility " by @entity31 ceo @entity81			1
@entity1 's has worked with @entity31 for more than half a century internationally , and for more than 22 years in mainland @entity3 , a spokesperson surnamed @entity82 told @entity83			1
meanwhile , beef and chicken products at most @entity86 in northern and central @entity3 are unavailable			1
branches in southern @entity3 , which use a different meat supplier , are largely unaffected			1
@entity82 also said the products will slowly return to menus after august 3			0
in @entity24 , @entity1 's previously stated that it does not use products from @entity61			1
it later backtracked the claim after local government issued a ban on the import and sales of @entity99 products			0
as a result of the ban , chicken nuggets , chicken filets , as well as several vegetable products and iced lemon tea are now temporarily unavailable at the city 's @entity1 's branches			1
@entity25 's @entity86 have also been affected as 20 % of the meat for chicken nuggets there were supplied by @entity61			1
it has since stopped importing chicken from @entity3 and introduced a tofu and fish version of the @entity115			2
the scandal has led to " negative impact on sales and consumer confidence , " the company 's @entity25 unit said in a statement			0
" our sales and profit expectations have been reduced			0
" who was held responsible ? although no one has fallen sick as a direct result of the tainted meat supply , @entity19 's @entity49 has closed the @entity77 plant at the center of the scandal , and detained five employees for questioning			2
meanwhile , @entity19 's top official has pledged to mete out " severe punishment " for anyone involved in the incident , @entity133 reported			0
@entity31 is conducting its own internal investigation , promising " swift and decisive action " against those responsible			0
it has also announced a number of organizational changes that it says will better ensure food safety at its @entity3 subsidiaries			1
this includes taking the previously separate and decentralized @entity3 operations and shifting them under the global management umbrella			0
it will also launch an @entity149 in @entity19 and a three - year , rmb 10 million ( $ 1.6 million ) food safety campaign			2
is @entity3 doing enough for food safety ? food safety has long been a top concern for @entity3 , affecting domestic and foreign companies			1
in 2008 , a major scandal erupted over tainted infant formula that killed several babies and left thousands more ill. earlier this year , @entity158 recalled donkey meat after it was found to be contaminated with fox meat			0
@entity161 , the owner of @entity68 and @entity69 , has just emerged from a food safety scandal that began in late 2012			2
the latest @entity61 scandal comes amid a revision of @entity3 's food safety laws			1
earlier this month , the @entity167 released a draft version of the law on its website , seeking public opinion			0
it promised harsher punishment for offenders			0
" over past years , punishment for food safety violators has been increased but it still lags far behind that in developed countries			2
there should be much higher punishment for offenders , " an anonymous industry insider told @entity133 .			0

expired meat was repackaged and sold to fast food chains in @entity3
@entity1 's is the only brand that will continue to work with the meat supplier
@entity3 has 2,000 @entity86 's branches across the country
