-- @entity2 drug agents in @entity3 took custody of five men wanted in the @entity2 on allegations of being part of a drug ring that sought to traffic in @entity11 methamphetamine and other drugs , @entity0 has learned			1
the men , who have @entity14 , @entity15 , @entity16 and @entity18 citizenship , were being flown to @entity19 to face charges , according to a source			1
@entity3 authorities announced the arrests after the men were turned over to @entity2 authorities			1
a @entity2 law enforcement official said the charges would be made public soon			1
the men are part of a broader investigation that federal prosecutors made public in september , filing charges against a group of former @entity2 and @entity34 ex-military men in a murder - for - hire and drug - importation plot			1
the @entity37 concocted a sting operation and arrested @entity39 , a former @entity41 sniper trainer nicknamed @entity42 , and four others in the sting case			0
the five more recently arrested were expelled by @entity3 authorities and put on a @entity37 plane to @entity19			1
additional details of the charges could n't be learned because they remain under seal			0
drug trafficking from @entity11 has occurred for decades with at least 50 documented incidents			1
in previous years , @entity11 had been linked to shipments of heroin and methamphetamine , according to the @entity55			0
in 2003 , a @entity11 ship , @entity56 which was carrying nearly 300 pounds of heroin , was seized along the eastern coast of @entity58 after a four - day chase			0
there is n't enough information to determine whether the @entity11 government is currently involved in drug trafficking , according to the @entity64 issued by the @entity65 " there have been no confirmed reports of large - scale drug trafficking involving @entity11 ( @entity11 ) state entities since 2004 , " it stated			1
" this suggests that state - sponsored drug trafficking may have ceased or been sharply reduced , or that the @entity11 regime has become more adept at concealing state - sponsored trafficking of illicit drugs			1
" the report also highlighted that the " proximity and availability of precursor chemicals in @entity80 likely contribute to the production of methamphetamine within @entity11			2
" it alluded to reported transactions between @entity11 traffickers and organized crime groups			0
corrupt security agents and government officials are likely responsible for transnational drug operations , according to a different report published in @entity91 in 2010			0
there is great difficulty in collecting data or accurate information regarding drug trafficking because of the secrecy in @entity11			2
so the report 's authors , @entity98 and @entity99 relied on interviews with 28 @entity11 defectors living in @entity80 and @entity3 as well as various documents			1
they could not be reached wednesday for this story			0
their report alleges that in the 1980s , the @entity11 state " deliberately chose various transnational crime businesses including drug trafficking " during economically troubled times			1
the @entity11 specialized in heroin trade and kept the drug away from the ordinary population			0
once the economy veered into famine and economic disaster in the 1990s , individuals desperate to survive turned to private drug enterprise , according to @entity98 and @entity99 's report			0
corrupt agents and officials sold drugs to transnational organized crime operations through the @entity11 - @entity80 border , they wrote			2
family members also became private drug traffickers , they added			0
after poppy production failed due to weather , methamphetamine became more popular , according to a 2007 @entity133 and @entity11 report prepared for the @entity134			2
one of the interviewees in @entity136 and @entity99 's report said that the city of @entity139 is the center of methamphetamine production , because it produces the country 's chemicals			0
internally , @entity11 started using opium instead of hard - to - obtain and pricey medication , according to the report			2
and recreational drug users are more likely wealthy businessmen or members of @entity149 , according to @entity151 media			0
more recently , methamphetamine is more widely used in @entity11 as stricter @entity80 border controls forced drug producers to seek a local market for " ice , " according to a report in the spring 2013 edition of the journal @entity91 .			2
