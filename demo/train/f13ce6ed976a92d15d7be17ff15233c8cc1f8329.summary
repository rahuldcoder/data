-- faster than a speeding bullet , @entity3 ' $ 225 million franchise reboot @entity1 has become a box office behemoth			1
the superhero film began its run with a massive $ 125.1 million ( $ 113.1 million over the traditional weekend , $ 12 million from corporate screening programs on thursday ) , breaking the record for the biggest june opening weekend ever , ahead of @entity11 3 's $ 110.3 million bow in 2010			1
among 2013 films , @entity1 had the second best debut of the year behind @entity15 3 , which started with $ 174.1 million in may			1
@entity1 garnered a fantastic $ 29,731 per theater average from its 4,207 locations			2
the film grossed $ 13.3 million in @entity21 theaters , and 41 % of its business came from @entity24 ticket sales			2
audiences were 56 percent male and 44 percent female , a more even gender distribution than @entity15 3 , which had a 61/39 percent male / female split on opening weekend			1
the dashing looks of @entity31 ( and @entity33 ' appeal ) no doubt helped @entity1 play well with women			0
reviews were mixed , but crowds issued the film a strong " a- " @entity39			0
for @entity31 , @entity41 , and the rest of the cast — which includes @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity47 , and @entity48 — @entity1 became their best ever opening weekend			1
the same goes for director @entity51 , who formerly saw gigantic numbers when 300 bowed with $ 70.9 million in 2007			0
what ' @entity1 ' gets wrong about @entity54 @entity1 also clobbered the debut of 2006 ′ s @entity56 , which opened with $ 52.5 million and earned $ 200 million domestically against a $ 270 million budget			1
widely considered a box office misfire , @entity56 did not , in fact , return			1
in about one week , @entity1 will likely have surpassed that film 's domestic total			1
the news could n't be better for @entity3 , which — with the exceptions of @entity64 and 42 — has badly struggled at the box office in 2013			1
films like @entity69 , @entity70 , @entity67 , @entity66 , and @entity71 have massively under - performed at the box office , so @entity1 's success is a welcome change			1
" we 're thrilled , " says @entity75 , the studio 's president of domestic distribution , " and it will fly through the summer			0
we 're going to have legs on this film			0
" @entity75 also notes that @entity1 's success brings @entity3 and @entity82 one step closer to creating a @entity85 franchise that might rival @entity88 / @entity87 's @entity86			2
the exec would n't confirm whether @entity31 has already been contracted to star in @entity85 films , though he did coyly remark , " @entity31 will be around for a while			0
" watch @entity31 train shirtless of ' @entity1 ' internationally , @entity1 soared with $ 71.6 million in its first weekend , including $ 17.6 million in the @entity94 and $ 9.8 million in @entity95			1
the film has yet to open in a number of large markets , but it 's already clear that it will easily outdo @entity54 returns $ 191 million international haul			2
in second place , this is the @entity101 opened with $ 20.5 million , giving the raunchy r - rated comedy $ 32.8 million total since its wednesday debut			1
while that 's not a huge start , @entity105 spent only $ 32 million on the comedy , which stars @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 , @entity113 , and @entity114			2
this is the @entity101 started in the same range as @entity113 and @entity109 's hit @entity117 , which opened with $ 23.3 million in 2008			0
thanks to great reviews and strong word - of - mouth ( the film earned a fair " @entity39 , but the polling service rarely favors edgy content ) , this is the end may find legs at the box office and could become a $ 100 million hit			1
audiences were 60 percent male and 48 percent below the age of 25 — and considering @entity1 provided direct competition for male viewers , this is the @entity101 's healthy start is commendable			0
now @entity135 managed to hold strong in third place with $ 10.3 million , marking a drop of only 46 percent			0
summit 's $ 75 million magician caper has now earned $ 80 million after three weekends , and if it can manage a few more slim holds , it could wind up passing $ 100 million			2
fourth place belonged to @entity143 , which fell 52 percent to $ 9.4 million in its fourth weekend			2
the $ 160 million @entity145 release has now earned $ 219.6 million total , surpassing @entity148 's $ 209.8 million cume and making it the highest grossing fast film domestically			0
worldwide , the same is true : @entity143 's $ 636.9 million haul is a franchise best			0
last weekend 's champion , @entity154 , plummeted 76 percent to $ 8.2 million in its sophomore frame			1
the thriller , which earned a weak " c " @entity39 has now earned $ 51.8 million and may have to settle for a finish in the $ 60 - 65 million range — a very low number considering @entity154 opened with $ 34.1 million			1
@entity145 is n't worried , though			0
the purge cost only $ 3 million to produce			0
@entity1 -- $ 113.1 million 2			2
this is the @entity101 -- $ 20.5 million 3			1
