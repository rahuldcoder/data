@entity0 , @entity1 -- an estimated 3 billion people -- nearly half the world 's population -- still use an open fire as their primary source of energy for cooking and heating			1
but there 's a problem : the smoke			1
" you have respiratory issues , lung disease , you 've got pneumonia , and you 've got longer - term issues like cancer and heart disease as well that can result from exposure to indoor air pollution , " said @entity14 , executive director of the @entity15			1
the @entity25 says this type of pollution causes nearly 2 million premature deaths each year			1
that 's more than tuberculosis and three times as many as malaria			2
@entity33 is among the people trying to do something about it			1
she works for @entity37 , which manufactures and sells " clean cookstoves " in @entity1			1
@entity37 's stoves are made with clay liners that , along with other simple design features , emit far less smoke and fewer pollutants			1
and they use a fraction of the fuel			2
" this ( stove ) , we have improved it , and it currently uses almost 50 % , compared to the traditional one , " she said , crouching beside one of @entity50 's models			2
" the charcoal consumption here is less , compared to the traditional one			2
" another benefit is that these stoves are made locally			0
a nearby workshop employs 21 people and churns out 400 to 500 stoves each month			1
each person follows a cookstove through every stage of production , from pottery to painting			0
this teaches each worker a variety of skills			0
producing locally also boosts the economy and keeps costs down , although price is an issue			1
cookstove prices start at about $ 6 ( @entity78 ) , a lot of money for many families in developing countries			0
still , @entity83 , a @entity0 resident , thinks the expense is worth the health of her family			0
she has used a clean stove for two years , she said , and she plans to buy another			2
while the upfront cost to buy a cookstove is high , the fuel costs are lower because it burns less			0
that , in turn , has an environmental impact			0
burning less charcoal or wood means there 's less deforestation , something that has caused flooding and other major problems in many countries			0
" it 's one relatively simple intervention that has a multitude of impacts , " @entity14 said			0
now , the challenge is to get clean stoves into enough homes to really make a difference			1

worldwide , nearly 2 million premature deaths each year are linked to indoor smoke
the smoke comes when people use an open fire to cook or heat their homes , a common practice
