he 's one of the fieriest political activists in @entity2 — he 's been called an " extremist " by @entity5 's state - run media — and he 's not even old enough to drive			1
meet 17 - year - old @entity6 , a skinny , bespectacled teen whose meager physical frame belies the ferocity of his politics			1
over the last two years , the student has built a pro-democracy youth movement in @entity2 that one veteran @entity13 dissident says is just as significant as the student protests at @entity15 , 25 years ago			1
echoing the young campaigners who flooded @entity19 's central square in 1989 , the teen activist wants to ignite a wave of civil disobedience among @entity2 's students			1
his goal ? to pressure @entity5 into giving @entity2 full universal suffrage			1
@entity6 's movement builds on years of pent - up frustration in @entity2			1
when the former colony of the @entity29 was returned to @entity13 rule in 1997 , the two countries struck an agreement promising @entity2 a " high degree of autonomy , " including the democratic election of its own leader			1
but 17 years later , little resembling genuine democracy has materialized			0
@entity5 's latest proposal suggests @entity39 may vote for their next leader , but only if the candidates are approved by @entity19			2
@entity6 is bent on fighting the proposal — and impatient to win			2
" i do n't think our battle is going to be very long , " he tells @entity43			0
" if you have the mentality that striving for democracy is a long , drawn - out war and you take it slowly , you will never achieve it			0
" you have to see every battle as possibly the final battle — only then will you have the determination to fight			0
" youth awakening doubt him if you like , but the young activist already has a successful track record of opposition			0
in 2011 , @entity6 , then 15 , became disgusted with a proposal to introduce patriotic , pro-communist " national and moral education " into @entity2 's public schools			1
with the help of a few friends , @entity6 started a student protest group called @entity64			2
the movement swelled beyond his wildest dreams : in september 2012 , @entity64 successfully rallied 120,000 protesters — including 13 young hunger strikers — to occupy the @entity2 government headquarters , forcing the city 's beleaguered leaders to withdraw the proposed curriculum			2
that was when @entity6 realized that @entity2 's youth held significant power			1
" five years ago , it was inconceivable that @entity2 students would care about politics at all , " he says			2
" but there was an awakening when the national education issue happened			0
we all started to care about politics			0
" asked what he considers to be the biggest threats to the city , he rattles them off : from declining press freedom as news outlets change their reporting to reflect a @entity92 slant , to " nepotism " as @entity19 - friendly politicians win top posts , the 17 - year - old student says @entity2 is quickly becoming " no different than any other @entity13 city under central administration			1
" that 's why @entity6 has set his eyes on achieving universal suffrage			1
his group , which now has around 300 student members , has become one of the city 's most vocal voices for democracy			0
and the kids are being taken seriously			0
in june , @entity64 drafted a plan to reform @entity2 's election system , which won the support of nearly one - third of voters in an unofficial citywide referendum			1
in july , the group staged a mass sit - in which drew a warning from @entity5 's vice president not to disrupt the " stability " of the city			1
in the end , 511 people were briefly arrested			0
this week , the group is mobilizing students to walk out of classes — a significant move in a city that reveres education — to send a pro-democracy message to @entity19			0
the student strike has received widespread support			0
college administrators and faculty have pledged leniency on students who skip classes , and @entity2 's largest teacher union has circulated a petition declaring " do n't let striking students stand alone			2
" @entity5 's reaction has been the opposite : @entity64 has been named a group of " extremists " in the mainland 's state - run media			1
@entity6 also says he is mentioned by name in @entity5 's @entity146 on @entity147 , which identifies internal threats to the stability of @entity151 rule			1
but the teenage activist wo n't back down			0
" people should not be afraid of their government , " he says , quoting the movie " @entity154 , " " the government should be afraid of their people			0
" @entity2 a " seed of fire " for @entity5 compared to activists in @entity2 , activists in mainland @entity5 face a situation far more grim			1
few understand this better than veteran human rights activist @entity165 , 41			2
a teenage participant in the 1989 @entity168 protests , he remembers witnessing the carnage in the aftermath of @entity13 government 's crackdown			2
" at the age of 15 , it made me understand my responsibility and my mission in life , " he tells @entity43 in a phone call from @entity19			0
" the crackdown made a clear cut between myself and the system			0
" @entity15 protester : i was willing to die inspired to fight for change , in 2000 he worked to expose " @entity186 villages " in central @entity5 , where unregulated blood trades were infecting entire rural towns with @entity189			2
but he paid a price : authorities jailed him for three and a half years for " inciting subversion of state authority , " then placed him under frequent house arrest , where he remains today			0
" fear has been deeply rooted in our genes through the past 65 years , " he says			0
" the majority of @entity5 's 1.3 billion people are not true citizens — most of the people are simply submissive			2
" that 's why @entity165 thinks @entity2 , with its relative freedom , is a perfect place for activists to spark a democracy movement that could sweep all of mainland @entity5			1
" you can form political parties in @entity2			2
you can publish books that are forbidden in mainland @entity5			2
the media can criticize the central government and the chief executive of @entity2			0
" @entity5 is a tinderbox that 's been physically suppressed by the authorities , and @entity2 is a seed of fire			1
" the @entity151 is very scared of this tiny bit of land , because if true universal suffrage can blossom in @entity2 , it is very likely true universal suffrage will end up happening in the mainland			1
" it 's a dream that @entity6 acknowledges			0
" i ca n't say we students striving for democracy now will directly lead to universal suffrage in @entity5 , " he says			1
" but at least , universal suffrage in @entity2 could be a pilot for the people in @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity19 , and even the whole of @entity5 — it would let them know that a @entity13 society under the rule of a @entity151 can still have a fair system			1
" because of the high stakes involved with challenging @entity5 , @entity165 says @entity2 's activists should prepare for the worst			1
" maybe the @entity13 government will one day send troops onto the streets , or even tanks , " @entity165 says , though adding the possibility of the military actually opening fire would be " very small			1
" more likely , says the elder activist , the party might go after individuals like @entity6 himself			0
" @entity6 could be arrested , or jailed , " @entity165 tells @entity43			1
" i hope he understands this will be a battle of resilience			0
it is not a fight , nor a skirmish , it is a true war , in terms of the length of time it involves , its complexity , and the potential sacrifice it might involve			0
