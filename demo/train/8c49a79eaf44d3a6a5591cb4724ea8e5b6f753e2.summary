-- @entity1 once joked , " politics is not a bad profession			0
if you succeed , there are many rewards			0
if you disgrace yourself , you can always write a book			1
" today , that joke would have to be updated to add that not only can you write a book , but you can also be on reality tv show , host cable news programs , run for office again and possibly even win			1
they 're like @entity14 from the " friday the 13th " movies -- you just ca n't kill them			0
they keep coming at you like the political version of zombies			2
sure , some fallen politicians still write books about their " adventures			1
" former @entity24 congressman @entity23 recently made the rounds on the talk show circuit to promote his new memoir			1
@entity23 , who resigned in 2006 , served more than a year in prison after pleading guilty to corruption charges in connection with the @entity32 lobbying scandal			1
but books are nothing compared to the other ways sullied politicians can profit off of their newly found infamy			2
former @entity39 gov. @entity38 -- who resigned because he was caught frequenting prostitutes -- went on to host not one , but two different shows on cable tv			1
the first one was on @entity0 , and the second one was on @entity46			0
then there 's exploiting your scandal in the time between when you 're indicted and convicted of the crime			2
former @entity52 congressman @entity51 -- while under indictment and awaiting a trial date -- appeared as a contestant on the hit tv show " @entity57			1
" @entity51 was later convicted of campaign finance violations and money laundering			1
but the guy who set the bar high for all disgraced politicians is former @entity64 gov. @entity63			1
after being removed from office by the state legislature and while under indictment , @entity63 wrote a book about his scandal , went on " @entity70 " and " @entity71 " and was a contestant on season 9 of @entity74 's " @entity75			1
" @entity63 even appeared at the @entity76 ( a comic book convention ) , where he charged $ 50 for autographs and $ 80 for a photo with him			1
he was subsequently convicted of corruption charges and sentenced to 14 years in prison			0
among politicians who do n't end up in jail , some try hard to become elected officials again			2
they want to go back to the very place that caused their problems			0
it 's like a recovering drug addict asking to work at a meth lab -- not a good combo			0
just look at former @entity95 gov. @entity94 , who is running to fill a recently vacated @entity97 seat			1
as a refresher , @entity94 disappeared for six days in 2009 while governor			2
at first , @entity94 's office publicly stated that he was hiking the @entity101			1
however , we soon found out that he was actually in @entity103 visiting the woman with whom he was having an extramarital affair			0
@entity94 seeks ' redemption ' in wild congressional race @entity94 later paid $ 74,000 to settle charges that he had misused state resources and campaign funds in conducting his affair			2
however , @entity94 refused to resign and completed his term			2
flash forward to march 19 : @entity94 came in first in a crowded field of @entity115 in the @entity97 primary			2
recent polls show him with a 10 - point lead over his opponent in the @entity115 primary runoff scheduled for april 2			0
@entity94 's quest for forgiveness in return to political life and do n't forget @entity125 , the former @entity126 congressman from @entity127			1
as most people , and all comedians , vividly recall , @entity125 had " accidentally " tweeted photos of himself in his underwear to a young woman on @entity133			0
@entity125 later admitted to having non-sexual but " inappropriate " relationships with various women on social media			0
@entity125 resigned from @entity137 a few weeks after the scandal broke in june 2011			0
what 's @entity125 up to now ? apparently he has figured out how to use @entity133 and is at least considering a return to politics			0
@entity125 revealed he had spent more than $ 100,000 on polls recently to explore possibly running for office in @entity127			0
what does it say about us that these disgraced politicians have success -- however fleetingly -- after their scandals ? is it because we are a forgiving lot who believe in second chances if the person has sincerely apologized and seeks redemption ? or is it because we are all infected with the reality - show mindset where we reward fame regardless of how it 's attained ? plenty of people do n't distinguish between whether a person is famous for good or bad reasons			1
all that matters is if a person has made it to that semi-exclusive club of celebritydom			0
after that , enough people will support the person to merit securing a book deal , being cast on a reality show and maybe run for office			1
look , i 'm all for redemption and second chances			0
but i 'm also aware that just like we saw with @entity14 in " friday the 13th " movies , the longer he 's alive , the more damage he will do			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity184 : disgraced politicians can write a book , go on tv , run for office again
@entity184 : fallen politicians never die , just like zombies
just think of @entity23 , @entity38 , @entity51 , @entity63 , @entity94 , he says
@entity184 : are we so forgiving because we reward fame regardless of how it 's attained ?
