@entity0 -- @entity2 's new rich have rushed to show off their wealth by spending on luxury status symbols , with the country now the world 's second biggest market for designer goods			1
it has meant boom times for @entity13 brands like @entity14 , @entity15 and @entity16			1
now , a small but growing group of taste - makers say @entity2 's fashion landscape is changing			1
home - grown designers and brands are ready to challenge their @entity22 counterparts as a new generation of consumers seek out items that reflect their own culture , rather than just the @entity13 heritage and exclusivity that have been so popular to date			1
meet the people making made in @entity2 cool : @entity31 : the magazine editor when @entity31 decided in 2005 to devote her fashion magazine , @entity34 , to covering @entity37 design , jaws dropped			1
advertisers pulled out and people told her the move was suicidal			0
" it was really hard , she says			0
" they told me ' there 's no such thing as @entity37 design '			0
" but each month , @entity31 and her team managed to feature an up - and - coming @entity37 designer , with the hope of putting @entity37 fashion on the map			1
it was a brave move in a country that has embraced @entity22 luxury labels like no other but @entity31 feels vindicated			2
by 2010 , her team was fielding several telephone calls a week from readers interested in buying the products featured on the magazine 's glossy pages			2
but with few shops willing stock lines by @entity37 designers , @entity31 took the plunge and opened her own boutique in @entity69			0
called @entity2 , it stocks designs by up to 50 @entity37 designers and has seen sales increase by 60 % a year			1
" we did n't have any illusions about making a huge fortune from @entity37 design but it is a sustainable business			0
" sales have increased , she says , as consumers , already accustomed to @entity22 luxury labels seek out something different			2
plus , an anti-corruption campaign that has seen sales fall at some @entity22 designer brands is also leading a change in appetites			1
but she cautions that it will be a while before we see a @entity37 equivalent of @entity14 or @entity16			1
young @entity37 designers want instant fame , she says , and do n't pay enough to the business side of the fashion world			2
" they all want to be the next @entity98 , " says @entity31 , who has been described as @entity2 's answer to @entity96 and @entity97			1
" it will happen ... but it will happen to a designer who is mature , who has commercially learned how to deal with international corporations and retailers			0
" @entity103 : the designer it 's the morning after her show at @entity107 and designer @entity103 is on the phone apologizing to her friends and clients who failed to get a front - row seat			1
featuring dozens of models sashaying down the catwalk in vibrant hues and striking headgear , it attracted huge crowds to the marquee in the city 's hip @entity121 district			0
the designer , originally from @entity125 , has been based in @entity0 for seven years and says she has developed a loyal coterie of customers who love , as she puts it , her " happy , glamorous clothes			0
" " they 've worn @entity16 in the past , they 've worn @entity14 but now they want something individual and just more fun and beautiful , " she says , from her studio which , with its day - glo colors and @entity37 pop - art sculptures , encapsulates her design philosophy			1
@entity103 designs four womenswear collections a year under her @entity142 brand			0
her biggest challenge , she says , is a lack of stores			0
she sells her clothes from her @entity0 studio and also travels to @entity148 regularly for trunk shows			0
" on our own we do n't have deep enough pockets , " she says			0
@entity103 , who previously worked as @entity14 's general manager for @entity125 , has also adopted a mentor role to the country 's younger designers			1
she starred as a judge on my style television show , @entity2 's equivalent to @entity160			1
" right now , it 's a novelty for the world to look into what @entity37 designers are doing , " she says			2
" it wo n't take one day to overturn the negative images of made in @entity2 that people had in the past but i think it 's coming along			1
" @entity103 , who takes her inspiration from anything from cartoons to @entity2 's ethnic minorities , says that it can be burdensome for local designers to get hung up on their @entity37 ancestry and history and they need to focus on global clothes for a global market			1
" i think we have to focus on how to be good designers instead of good @entity37 designers			0
" @entity183 : the retailer @entity183 runs luxury @entity148 department store chain , @entity185 -- @entity187 's answer to @entity188			0
it sells clothing , shoes and accessories from 500 international designers online and at its seven stores in @entity148 , @entity69 and @entity0			0
in october , clothes by @entity37 designers were sold for the first time alongside the likes of @entity200 and @entity201 at its newly opened @entity0 flagship store			0
" it 's a natural progression for us to work with design talent here , " he says			0
" what 's surprised people is the prominence that we 're giving these designers			2
we 're already re-ordering so the demand for these designers has definitely hit			0
" depending on their @entity0 reception , the designers will see their clothes in other @entity185 stores and for sale internationally on the store 's website			2
for @entity222 - one of three designers chosen -- it 's a massive opportunity			1
her @entity0 boutique lies at basement level near a food court beneath @entity228 -- one of the city 's swankiest shopping districts			0
one day she hopes her name will feature among the @entity234 and @entity16 boutiques above ground			2
" we are proud of made in @entity2			1
i think our image is getting better but i 'm still not sure deep inside how much people appreciate local brands , " says @entity237			0
@entity183 believes that if @entity2 is able to marry its manufacturing capability with commercial acumen and the creativity of designers like @entity237 , it will become a fashion force to be reckoned with			1
" we will see @entity2 referenced as a thought leader , as an innovator and a driver of ... trends			2
