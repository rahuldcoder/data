-- the @entity1 , @entity2 's spiritual leader , set off a media kerfuffle this month when he spoke about his next reincarnation			1
not a man afraid to surprise people , he told two @entity8 journalists that he did n't see a need for there to be more @entity1 in the future			2
the @entity8 newspaper concluded that this meant he was not planning to return as a reincarnation			2
a @entity16 news agency announced that there would be no more @entity19 spiritual leaders			0
the @entity1 's office in @entity21 protested that he had been misquoted			1
eventually , people began to listen to the original interview , where it was noticed that the @entity1 had clearly said " i hope and pray that i will return			2
" end of palpitations for his loyal followers and @entity19 nationalists , who very much want him to come back			0
in fact , the @entity1 , who fled to @entity21 in 1959 after a failed uprising by @entity19 against @entity31 rule , has often spoken about major change in the institution he embodies			1
he 's said that there might be no more @entity1 , that the next one could be elected rather than discovered , that it would be good if she were a woman , and even that he might not be the actual @entity1 anyway			2
but these are always marked as forms of speculation			0
his formal position on this question is quite clear			0
in 2011 , in a rare " gal che'i bka ' yig " or " @entity43 " , he declared that he will make a decision on the future of the @entity1 lineage in around 2024 after consulting with other high lamas and the @entity19 public			2
if there is to be a successor , he announced , it will either be a child identified as a reincarnation after his death , or a person recognized as an " emanation , " chosen by him while he is still alive			0
and , he added , " i shall leave clear written instructions " -- presumably to help journalists and others get the story right			0
future there are practical reasons behind the @entity1 's efforts to prepare people for systemic change			1
reincarnation as a succession system can produce highly effective charismatic leaders , but it has a structural flaw : it takes several years for a new child to be found and identified , and then another 15 years or more before the successor can take up the work of leadership			1
in addition , the system is famously prone to interference , corruption , and power struggles , not to mention ridicule : in the 1870s , according to the scholar @entity83 , a @entity82 street song had the refrain " her excellency mrs @entity87 's ass is black with soot , " in honor of a famous aristocrat who tried to entice a future @entity1 into her womb by burning incense under it			2
the @entity1 's decision three years ago to hand the running of his exile government over to an elected leader was partly designed to remedy these problems			1
but even without any official position , he still remains the most influential figure in the @entity19 world , and no - one has yet come up with a credible solution to the @entity19 - @entity31 dispute that does not depend on him			0
but there have been no official talks between the two sides for four years			0
president @entity109 is making his first trip to @entity21 since taking power , but at 79 years old , the @entity1 needs to push @entity31 urgently to resume dialogue with his representatives			1
he knows that @entity31 is determined to appoint the next @entity1 -- it passed a government regulation in 2007 declaring that henceforth only it is allowed to permit a lama to reincarnate			2
hinting that he might not return is a reminder by the @entity1 to @entity117 that time is running out if it wants to avoid a lengthy dispute once he dies			1
imperial response if the @entity1 's aim was to goad @entity117 into a response , it worked			1
in one of history 's more bizarre instances of role reversal , @entity31 's @entity125 spokeswoman reprimanded the @entity1 for telling the @entity8 he might not return and called on him to respect the practice of reincarnation			1
" @entity31 follows a policy of freedom of religion and belief , " she said , " and this naturally includes having to respect and protect the ways of passing on @entity138			0
" this apparently does n't include the @entity1 's ways of passing it on , because , it was explained , he " has ulterior motives , and is seeking to distort and negate history , which is damaging to the normal order of @entity138			1
" the spokeswoman was right that history is a good place to turn to for solutions to this dispute			0
as she went on to say , @entity31 's rulers in the past issued titles to previous @entity1			1
but the details are important : emperors only did that in some cases , they did n't try to interfere as to who was chosen , and the lamas held their titles whether or not they received imperial endorsement			0
even as late as the mid- 1990s , the @entity161 's practice was somewhat similar : they left decisions regarding reincarnations to local lamas and their followers and just rubber - stamped the choice once it was made			0
in the last two decades that @entity117 has reverted to trying to control every detail of @entity19 religion , and at the same time blame all setbacks on the @entity1			1
neither of these approaches reflects @entity31 history or custom towards @entity2			0
the lessons of the past would let @entity19 decide for themselves how to implement traditions , which @entity117 could then confirm if it felt it needed to			0
the @entity1 's apparently offhand remarks to the @entity8 journalists and the @entity31 put - down were thus a form of diplomatic push - pull in public			1
for that to ever lead to a solution , @entity117 will need to think more about respect than about control , and the @entity1 will need to reassure @entity117 about his intentions			2
until that happens , expect more cryptic exchanges between the two via the world 's media .			0

@entity1 's comments about his next reincarnation set off a media kerfuffle
reincarnation produces charismatic leaders , but has structural flaws , says @entity201
hinting he might not return is a reminder to @entity117 that time is running out
at 79 , @entity1 needs to push @entity31 urgently to resume dialogue
