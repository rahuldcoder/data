@entity0 -- @entity2 is completely off the hook for an incident in which a @entity0 woman accused him of trying to take her cell phone last month			0
but a @entity0 prosecutor is expected to soon charge @entity2 , 20 , with vandalism in a separate incident , the egging of his neighbor 's mansion , a source involved in the case told @entity1 on monday			2
the @entity0 city attorney decided monday there was " a lack of evidence " to prosecute the singer for attempted robbery in connection with an argument with a woman at a miniature golf park last month , according to spokesman @entity17			1
the case was handed to the city attorney 's office last week for consideration of a misdemeanor charge after the @entity0 district attorney declined to file a felony charge			1
@entity2 avoids felony robbery charge in cell phone ' tussle ' a criminal charge in the egging probe is coming as soon as monday afternoon , a source told @entity1			1
the @entity0 district attorney has been considering the case since february , when sheriff 's investigators recommended that @entity2 , be charged with felony vandalism for the january incident			1
the vandalism case is what lawyers call a " wobbler , " meaning the district attorney must decide if it will be prosecuted as a felony -- which could have much more serious consequences for the singer -- or as a misdemeanor			2

@entity74 detectives are pushing for a felony charge , based on the estimated $ 20,000 in damage caused by the eggs			0
is @entity2 getting special treatment ? @entity2 's attorneys met with prosecutors in march to argue that since the egging was " a silly prank " and @entity2 has no criminal record , it should be treated as a misdemeanor , two sources at the time said			1
@entity2 , 20 , has since moved from the neighborhood , selling the mansion to @entity90			0
@entity2 's drunken driving charge in @entity92 is also still pending , although a source close to that case said talks are under way to reach a plea deal to avoid a trial			2
