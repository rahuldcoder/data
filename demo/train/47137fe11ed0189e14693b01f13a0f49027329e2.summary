-- the @entity2 government should immediately release more than 280,000 displaced @entity4 civilians living in detention camps , a leading human rights group said wednesday			1
@entity4 civilians are at @entity9 refugee camp on the outskirts of the northern town of @entity12 , @entity2			1
@entity13 said the displaced @entity2 were already victims of a protracted and bloody civil war			1
now they are victims again , confined against their will , like criminals , the global watchdog group said			0
" keeping several hundred thousand civilians who had been caught in the middle of a war penned in these camps is outrageous , " said @entity20 , @entity21 director for @entity13			1
" have n't they been through enough ? " but a @entity28 spokesman said the @entity13 report is overstated , and he defended the government 's handling of the displaced			1
" those are not detention camps , " said the spokesman , @entity32			1
" they are relief villages			0
all the basic facilities are being given to the people			0
" @entity2 declared victory in may in its 25 - year battle with the @entity41 rebels , but concerns remain about how the island nation can heal visceral war wounds			2
the rebels -- formally known as the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) -- waged war for an independent state for minority tamils in @entity2 since july 1983			2
as many as 70,000 people were killed in the conflict			0
with the cease - fire , the question of how to resettle @entity4 refugees , many of whom were living among the rebels , has wrought intense criticism of the government from international humanitarian agencies			1
the @entity60 reported that as of july 19 , @entity2 was detaining 281,621 people in 30 military guarded camps in the four northern districts of @entity12 , @entity64 , @entity65 and @entity66			1
@entity13 said humanitarian workers are prohibited from discussing abuses or the final months of the ethnic conflict and that camp residents are allowed to leave only for emergency medical care , often only with military escort			1
in some camps , people have to register with the military twice a day , the rights group said			2
if they fail , they are subject to punitive measures such as being forced to stand still under the sun for extended periods of time			0
the group reported health problems created by inconsistent water supply and a shortage of bathroom facilities			1
but @entity32 , the @entity88 spokesman , said barbed wire around the compounds is a common way to define barriers in @entity2 and that military guards were being utilized out of security concerns			2
the government fears that rebels are hiding in the camps and screening people living in them			2
" these are people who were kept for months in @entity41 clutches , " @entity32 said , referring to the displaced civilians			2
he said the government has a 180 - day plan to resettle most people but that a lot of work was needed in the northern districts as far as rebuilding infrastructure and basic services destroyed in the fighting			0
the human rights activists say , however , that the government is not working fast enough			0
@entity13 said @entity2 's goal now is only to resettle 60 percent of the refugees by the end of the year			1
@entity117 assistant secretary of state @entity116 visited a camp this week in @entity12 , after which he announced an additional $ 8 million in humanitarian aid for the northern districts			0
but even in handing out dollars , @entity116 was critical of @entity2 's handling of the displaced			1
in a statement , he acknowledged that providing food , shelter and medical care for the displaced people was a " formidable task			0
" but @entity116 said the @entity117 remains " deeply concerned " about the confinement of people to camps and the hardships they endure within those camps			0
he also criticized the restrictions placed on humanitarian workers visiting the camps			0
" the government of the @entity117 believes the focus now must be on the prompt return of the displaced in safety and dignity , and we want to accelerate this process , " @entity116 said			0
in addition to global humanitarian aid , the @entity145 has approved a $ 2.6 billion loan to @entity2 to mend the country			2
@entity150 said @entity2 , in need of global sympathy in its efforts to rebuild , could very well go the opposite way if the tamil people , once subjugated by the rebels , keep waking up as prisoners of their own state .			0
