@entity0 -- @entity3 officials used cyber monday to announce court orders shutting down 150 domain names of commercial websites they say were selling " many millions " of dollars worth of counterfeit goods			1
sports jerseys and uniforms , dvds , shoes and handbags , golf sets and exercise equipment were among the more popular purchases of " knock off " versions of name brand products , officials said			2
investigations show the majority of those engaged in defrauding rights - holding companies and consumers are from @entity26 , but the phony goods are also produced in other countries , according to top law enforcement officials			1
the officials say they conduct undercover purchases with the help of legitimate rights holders to confirm the goods are bogus			1
they acknowledge the operators of the websites are beyond the reach of @entity3 agents , and when the sites selling counterfeit goods are shut down , the same criminal enterprises sometimes simply change domain names and continue to prey on customers			1
the @entity46 agency , the @entity43 and @entity3 attorney offices cooperated in the investigation , dubbed @entity48			2
this marked the second annual cyber monday crackdown			0
last year , the government shut down 80 websites			0
" we will not tolerate those who seek to profit by abusing the @entity57 and stealing intellectual property at the expense of authors , artists , and inventors , " said assistant attorney general @entity54			1
@entity54 and @entity46 director @entity63 said that despite the challenges , increased international cooperation is helping to wage war on the theft of intellectual property			0
the operation they announced monday is designed in part to educate consumers to be wary of websites that appear to be offering name brand products at substantially reduced prices			1
authorities say they are unable to provide estimates of losses from cyber criminals , but are concerned that some of the millions of dollars in proceeds may end up in the hands of organized crime			2
the government places banners on the seized websites explaining why they were shut down			0
last year , the banners registered 77 million hits , so authorities are hopeful public awareness of the criminal nature of the problem is increasing			0
" this is simply downright theft , " @entity63 said			0
beyond clothing and electronic knock - offs , he said , officials are especially worried about the threat to safety and health when counterfeit goods involve such things as air bags , drugs , car batteries and engine parts			1
" if the price is too good to be true , it probably is , " said @entity63 , who added consumers can help themselves by being on the lookout for misleading labels and spelling errors to avoid getting ripped off			0
