the four remaining @entity1 candidates played to their individual strengths on thursday and tried to leave a lasting impression in a final , boisterous debate two days before @entity6 's pivotal primary			1
in a campaign cycle where debates have had direct consequences on the ebb and flow of the race , former house speaker @entity7 turned his contempt for the media into one of his strongest performances yet			0
when @entity20 chief national correspondent @entity19 opened the debate with a question about open marriage , following an interview by @entity26 's ex-wife saying that he had sought one , the @entity18 chastised him			1
" to take an ex-wife and make it two days before the primary a significant question in a presidential campaign is as close to despicable as anything i can imagine , " @entity26 told @entity19 , the moderator of the debate			1
@entity26 's response elicited loud applause from the audience			1
the debate came at the end of a ground - shaking day that saw former @entity43 sen. @entity42 being declared winner of the @entity46 caucuses more than two weeks after his apparent second - place finish to former @entity49 gov. @entity48 and @entity51 gov. @entity50 dropping out of the race and throwing his support to @entity26			1
@entity51 rep. @entity54 was the fourth candidate in the debate			0
@entity56 on debate : fireworks , but little substance an angry @entity26 chastised @entity20 for starting off with the question about his marriage			1
hours before the debate , @entity63 and the @entity64 released interviews with @entity26 in which she alleged @entity26 asked for an " open marriage " before their divorce			1
@entity26 told the @entity64 that a day after her husband told her about his affair with @entity74 in may 1999 , the former @entity71 speaker delivered a speech titled " @entity76 " to a group of @entity18 women in @entity43			2
" how could he ask me for a divorce on monday and within 48 hours give a speech on family values and talk about how people treat people ? " @entity26 said in her interview with the @entity64			2
@entity26 said the story was false			0
the three other presidential candidates on the stage passed on the chance to criticize @entity26 over the allegations by his ex-wife			1
@entity48 took the steady , cautious route that he has throughout the campaign , responding to his rivals only when attacked			2
@entity42 presented himself as a more conservative option to @entity48 than @entity26 and as the candidate who could draw an effective contrast in the fall with president @entity99			1
as the debate was going on , @entity26 's campaign released his tax returns as he had promised to do earlier			1
@entity48 was asked if he would follow his father 's lead in releasing 12 years of tax returns			1
@entity48 's father , @entity106 , ran for the 1968 @entity18 presidential nomination			2
" maybe , " @entity48 said , before highlighting his business experience and his personal success			0
" i did n't inherit money from my parents			0
what i have , i earned			0
" as he had earlier this week , @entity42 said he filed his own returns and they were at home on his computer and he would release them once he returned home			0
@entity54 said he had no intention to release his returns , arguing that congressional financial statements are revealing enough			0
the issue of electability was hotly debated			0
earlier this week , @entity26 called for both @entity50 and @entity42 to drop out of the race and support his candidacy because they did n't have the experience for a large undertaking like a presidential campaign			1
with @entity50 gone , @entity42 was left to respond			2
" @entity132 has never been a problem with @entity7 , " @entity42 said , arguing that he 's the steady choice and @entity18 should n't pick a nominee who might surprise them			2
while @entity26 and @entity42 debated their records in @entity136 and specifically who was more responsible for the @entity138 of the 1990s , @entity48 raised his hand to argue it 's time for a @entity136 outsider			1
" we need to send to @entity136 someone who has not lived in @entity136 , but someone who 's lived in the real streets of @entity146 , " @entity48 said			2
every candidate onstage said they opposed the anti-internet piracy bill roiling @entity150 , and criticized the proposal for being too intrusive			0
however , both @entity48 and @entity42 said they could support a more narrow law that would help protect intellectual property rights online			1
displaying the off - the - cuff wit he has used to great effect at a series of @entity1 debates , @entity26 joked he was none too sympathetic to movie and music producers who pushed for the legislation			2
" you 're asking a conservative about the economic interest of @entity168 , " @entity26 said to laughter in the audience			0
" and i 'm weighing it , i 'm weighing it			0
i 'm not rushing in			0
" meanwhile @entity54 touted his libertarian - leaning views , adding he had been an early detractor of the bill			0
he said as president he would be unique in his ability to work with leaders on both sides of the aisle to protect civil liberties			0
the former obstetrician and gynecologist forced his way into the conversation on both health care and abortion , two issues he knows a lot about			0
" i thought maybe you were prejudiced against doctors and a doctor that practiced medicine in the military or something , " @entity54 told @entity19 after a section where the other three candidates answered a question on whether a full repeal of president @entity99 's health care reform was truly possible			0
after a lengthy debate among the other three candidates over the legitimacy of criticizing @entity48 's political conversion from pro-abortion rights to anti-abortion rights , the crowd booed and chanted @entity54 's name when @entity19 moved on without letting @entity54 weigh in			1
" @entity19 , once again , it 's a medical subject and i 'm a doctor , " @entity54 said			0
four polls over the last two days show @entity48 's long - held lead in @entity6 nearly evaporating into single digits by the time the four took the stage , while @entity26 has surged into a virtual tie			1
@entity26 on thursday grabbed a major endorsement when @entity50 announced he was backing @entity26 as he suspended his campaign			2
@entity42 's campaign got a boost on thursday when the @entity1 released the final certified results from its january 3 caucuses , which reversed @entity48 's eight - vote victory and instead determined that @entity42 had won by 34 votes .			1
