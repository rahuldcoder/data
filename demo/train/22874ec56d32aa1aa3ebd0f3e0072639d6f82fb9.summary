@entity0 -- i strolled through the halls of the @entity5 's headquarters in @entity0 the other day , perusing all the family photos of @entity8 leaders at various summit meetings over the years			1
there was deposed @entity12 president @entity11 , deposed and violently disposed of @entity14 " @entity13 " @entity15 , exiled @entity17 president @entity16 @entity18 , @entity20 's beleaguered president @entity19 , and @entity22 's embattled president @entity21			1
uneasy , i thought , must sit the other heads of state featured in those photos			0
but it was those surviving leaders , of such less - than - democratic countries as @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , to name a few , who instructed their foreign ministers to vote saturday to suspend @entity22 from the @entity5 over its bloody suppression of the eight - month - old uprising there			1
in the final months of 2011 , the future is looking very uncertain for the creaking @entity8 political order			2
@entity12 and @entity17 are no longer solid , reliable members of the bloc of conservative , pro-western " moderate " @entity8 regimes the @entity38 cobbled together in the aftermath of the october 1973 @entity8 - @entity44 war			1
revolutions and revolts -- finished and ongoing -- must be depriving many rulers of a good night 's sleep			0
the citizens of the @entity8 world have finally had enough of the tired charades of the past			2
increasingly endangered are the sham referendums where presidents won 99 percent of votes , where hardly anyone took the time to cast a ballot , the " parties " that were little more than mafias with empty slogans , and the state intelligence thugs who were a law unto themselves			0
that stuff just does n't cut it anymore			0
as we strolled together through a ransacked intelligence headquarters in @entity70 , @entity14 , a few months ago , one man told me : " we used to fear our rulers			0
" this year almost every @entity8 state , from the @entity75 to the @entity76 , has had to at least go through the motions of initiating political reform			2
and while they 'd be loathe to share their true motivations , i suspect @entity8 rulers did n't vote against @entity22 because they are new converts to people power or support the bloodied opponents of @entity86			1
no , there is more to this vote than the so - called " @entity89			2
" as much as aging @entity8 autocrats fear their people , they also fear @entity93			1
the last 10 years have been good for @entity93			2
first , the @entity38 led an international coalition to oust @entity93 's bitter enemies , the @entity96 , from power in @entity98			1
less than two years later , the @entity38 did it again in @entity100 , bringing down another implacable foe of @entity93 , @entity102 , and then installing a new political order in @entity104 much more friendly to @entity105			1
in 2006 the @entity38 backed @entity44 's ill - fated summer war against @entity93 's @entity108 ally , @entity109 , which emerged from the 33 - day conflict stronger than ever			1
in 2007 , @entity112 , also friends with @entity93 , ousted the @entity38 - backed @entity114 faction of @entity116 president @entity115 from @entity117			1
@entity93 was an enthusiastic backer of the revolt against the leaders of @entity121 earlier this year , though that uprising was crushed with @entity28 help			0
in the meantime , there is growing fear over @entity93 's perceived nuclear ambitions , those fears stoked by regular pronouncements over the past two decades from @entity130 that @entity93 " is on the verge of producing a nuclear weapon			1
" against this backdrop is an across - the - board diminution of @entity38 power in the @entity136			0
at the end of this year the @entity38 will end its military presence in @entity100 , and soon afterward , it will do the same in @entity98			0
the @entity141 administration , with 2012 elections looming and after several half - hearted false starts and high - profile humiliations by @entity44 prime minister @entity145 , appears to have given up trying to broker real peace between @entity44 and the @entity116			0
above and beyond regional issues , the @entity38 economy -- and thus , its political clout -- is in decline			2
increasingly , @entity38 is viewed in the @entity136 as an economically bankrupt , militarily and diplomatically overextended , withering superpower			2
in short , a huge vacuum looms in the region , and @entity93 could be the chief beneficiary			0
@entity28 and the other @entity76 states are alarmed , and are eager to cut @entity93 down to size			0
the uprising in @entity22 went a long way to undercut @entity93 's oldest and most reliable @entity8 ally in @entity160 , and saturday 's vote to suspend @entity22 from the @entity5 was an added bonus			1
@entity22 is now isolated more than ever before , which means @entity93 's other allies in the region -- @entity112 and @entity109 -- could suffer , too			1
there are other players in this great game			0
@entity173 , having been repeatedly rebuffed in its attempts to gain membership in the @entity172 , has struck out on its own under prime minister @entity174			0
missing in the emerging regional equation are any @entity8 counterweights to a resurgent @entity173 , but more immediately , @entity93			1
@entity102 , who fought an 8 - year war with @entity93 , has been replaced by a government in @entity104 with close ties to @entity105			0
@entity12 , the @entity8 world 's most populous nation and once one of the main pillars of the old order , is in the throes of post-revolutionary upheaval			2
the surviving members of those group photos at the @entity5 are clutching at anything they can to make sure they can live for another summit meeting -- and another group photo .			0

there is more to the vote against @entity22 than the " @entity89 "
as much as @entity8 autocrats fear their people , they also fear @entity93
@entity93 's regional position has *strengthened* in the last decade
@entity38 's is perceived to be withering
