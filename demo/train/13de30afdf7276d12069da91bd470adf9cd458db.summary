the idea of integrating the @entity2 nations into one entity -- and replacing what exists now as simply a cooperative -- was first floated by @entity3 in december			1
monday 's meeting in @entity14 will lay out the timetable for it			0
the @entity2 comprises @entity17 , @entity18 , @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity3 , and the @entity21			1
" the threats of all kinds require the hard works of the @entity2 countries to shift from a current formula of cooperation to a union formula acceptable to the six countries , " @entity3 foreign minister @entity22 said last month			1
he did n't specify what threats he was referring to			0
but some analysts have said the @entity2 move could be an effort to counter the growing influence of @entity36			1
the @entity2 was formed in 1981 , soon after @entity36 instituted a @entity38 theocracy and went to war with primarily @entity40			1

@entity36 views them as part of its territory			2
" i think president ( @entity76 ) @entity75 , when he visited the @entity78 island a couple weeks ago , in a way he highlighted the need for the union to counter the adventurism of the @entity83 government , " said @entity2 assistant secretary general @entity72			1
in this climate comes the @entity2 move to form a union			1
" such strategic vision would include common approaches to defense , security , political and economic long - term interests , " @entity72 said in an opinion piece sunday in the @entity3 english - language daily , @entity89			0
already , @entity95 , @entity17 's main @entity38 opposition party , has demanded that the @entity17 government put the idea to a popular vote before it agrees			0
