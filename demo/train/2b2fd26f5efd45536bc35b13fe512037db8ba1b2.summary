-- the @entity2 's ability to teach the lessons of the @entity4 to future generations relies on its collections			1
the museum has been on a 20th anniversary four - city tour to engage the public and gather artifacts that tell survivors ' stories in vivid , lasting and personal ways			1
the museum held a historic gathering of @entity4 survivors and @entity18 veterans in @entity19 for a national marking of its 20th anniversary			1
the road trip started in @entity23 , @entity24 , and continued in @entity25 and @entity26			2
now we 're in @entity28 , where sunday , june 9 , the museum will hold a daylong public event with many opportunities to engage with museum resources , people , and programs , and pay tribute to local @entity4 survivors and @entity18 veterans			1
in @entity25 , we met a woman who was born in 1939 , after her father was deported from @entity39 , @entity40 , to the concentration camps , where he spent the next five years			2
her mother and grandmother worked for the @entity45 community and were never deported from @entity39			2
this woman spent her childhood in the hospital of the @entity44 , where her mother managed to survive and keep them from being deported			0
7 life lessons from a @entity4 survivor it was amazing that three generations of @entity45 women managed to survive @entity57 occupation			0
they had to care for themselves , surviving day to day , and care for their very young child			0
it seems unfathomable they made it			0

the were refused entry into @entity77 and the @entity78 and headed back to @entity79 , where many of them eventually wound up in the hands of the @entity75			0
the uncle and his wife were deported to concentration camps			0
the wife survived ; the husband perished			0
when the survivors and other witnesses to the crimes of @entity57 are no longer able to tell their stories , it will be the collections -- artifacts , documents , pictures , films -- that will help transmit this history and its lessons			1
that 's why we 're racing to rescue the evidence of the @entity4 by working in 40 countries to preserve these materials			0
@entity103 : faith in the messenger to date our collections include more than 17,250 objects , 68.1 million pages of documentation , 135 million digital images from the @entity111 , 87,500 photographs and images and more than 1,030 hours of video footage			1
we expect our collections to double in size over the next decade			2
the museum 's 20th anniversary is bringing @entity4 history to communities nationwide			1
each tour stop featured programming that explores the history of the @entity4 and looks at why it remains so relevant for us today			2
even if people can not attend a tour stop or do not have collections to donate , people can still get involved			1
@entity129 has developed 20 actions that anyone , anywhere can take to help preserve @entity4 memory and apply its lessons today			0
visit ushmm.org / neveragain to see how you can participate			0
you can also see highlights from the previous tour stops and the @entity139 to @entity141 veterans			2
we will continue to examine issues like the dangers of hate and indifference , the threats of continuing mass violence and genocide and what we can do about them			0
we want people to understand this history and move from asking " what would i have done ? " to " what will i do ? " the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity159			1
