-- a planned strike by @entity3 footballers has been averted after a @entity5 court ruled against a petition filed by a trade union that represents the country 's players			1
the @entity3 @entity10 ( @entity11 ) had applied to postpone the next round of @entity3 league games , including @entity16 's @entity15 match against @entity17 on sunday , by 24 hours			2
the union argued that it had an agreement with the @entity20 that matches would not be played during @entity23 's winter break which lasts up to and including january 2			1

according to @entity3 sports newspaper @entity33 , five first division and ten second division matches would have been affected if the strike was allowed to go ahead			2

i 've received 50 % of my monthly wages on two occasions and did n't get paid at all in the other four months , " he told @entity40 newspaper @entity47			0
" i have a mortgage and several other bills that need to be paid and i ca n't accept that @entity42 are not paying me			0
