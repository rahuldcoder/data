-- " @entity1 , " written by @entity2 , is a novel about a 50 - year - old @entity6 professor 's struggle with @entity8 's disease			1
it 's also a book , @entity2 was told , that nobody would want to read			1
@entity2 , author of " @entity1 , " found success after self - publishing her novel			1
after spending 1Â½ years writing " @entity1 , " @entity2 spent just as much time trying to find a literary agent			1
" i never heard a response from most of the query letters i sent , " @entity2 said			1
" four literary agents asked to see the book			1
one of them said she just did n't think there was a general audience that would want to read about @entity8 's			0
" when she was turned down by several traditional publishing houses , @entity2 decided to follow a different route : self - publishing via web - based companies			1
when she informed one of the literary agents of her decision , his response was daunting			0
" he said , ' do n't do that , you 'll kill your writing career before it starts , ' " said @entity2			2
but she decided to press forward			0
turning to the @entity39 self - publishing brand , @entity38 , @entity2 published her book for $ 450 , a cost that included an @entity42 -- the @entity42 that uniquely identifies books -- and the ability to sell on @entity45			1
months later , after receiving positive reviews on @entity45 and a favorable review in the @entity49 , @entity2 's book was picked up by @entity50 and is in its 12th week on the @entity51			1
" if you believe in your book , i think you should give it a chance , " @entity2 said			1
" @entity1 " " was a book that people already identified with and [ @entity50 ] saw the book 's potential in a very real way			0
" @entity2 is not alone			2
as the economy takes its toll on traditional publishing houses -- @entity63 dropped its @entity63 division in february , losing major executives and editors , and @entity67 continues with cutbacks -- more authors are looking to online self - publishing companies			1
companies like @entity39 or @entity72 allow any budding author to submit a digital file of their manuscript on any subject matter			2
unlike traditional publishing companies , these publishers only produce hard copies of the books when a customer buys one , a process known as print on demand			1
" anyone can publish , that 's the beauty of it , " said @entity86 , director of public relations at @entity72			0
" nobody 's going to say , ' we do n't like your cover			0
chapter 10 should be @entity96			0
' " this means that the author retains the copyright to his or her book and is responsible for almost everything , from the costs for printing to , if they choose , marketing the book			2
manufacturing prices with @entity72 range from $ 4 to $ 19 per copy , depending on whether the book is a hardback or paperback and on the number of pages			0
authors pay only when they buy a book			0
@entity72 also offers publishing packages that include formatting , cover design , editing , marketing and more , beginning at $ 299			0
since its inception in 2002 , @entity72 has digitally published more than 820,000 titles , @entity120 said			0
about 5,000 new titles are added each week			0
" with this economy , there are people who really need to make money and people with more time on their hands , " @entity120 said			0
" we 've been seeing a surge since november in people publishing			0
" since 1997 , @entity39 has helped more than 70,000 authors publish more than 100,000 titles , according to @entity133 , the company 's vice president of marketing			0
depending on the brand chosen , publishing with author solutions can cost an author anywhere from $ 399 to $ 12,999			0
@entity138 , another @entity39 brand , offers basic do - it - yourself publishing free , although other @entity138 services , such as a custom cover or illustrations , are sold individually			2
@entity133 cited several pluses of print - on - demand publishing : the speed with which a book gets into the marketplace ; the fact that readers , not critics , " decide whether your book is any good or not , " and the environmental benefit of fewer printed copies			1
" with print on demand , there are n't that many dead trees , " said @entity120			2
" we hear that on our forums that people do like that			0
" print on demand also allows for the " opportunity for a greater return on your investment ... it just makes sense from an economic standpoint , " said @entity133 , who believes many writers who 've worked with author solutions have had success they would not have found at traditional publishers			1
similarly , @entity177 , author of " @entity178 : adventures from the @entity180 , " saw success after she published with @entity72			1
@entity177 was turned down by three publishing companies that , she said , all told her the same thing			1
" people were saying , ' this is fantastic , hilarious			0
i 'm going to throw up if i read another memoir , ' " @entity177 said			2
publishing companies told @entity177 that her book would not appeal to mainstream audiences			1
but @entity177 believed her stories held value for many mothers			2
though she says she has sold fewer than 300 books , mostly by word - of - mouth , the book has brought her new visibility			2
@entity177 has appeared on various panels across the country to share her insight on being a mother and is scheduled to appear on " the @entity201 " to talk about a new @entity203 television show called " in the @entity204			2
" " i 'm happy about my success because i did n't really set out for it			0
it just kind of happened , " said @entity177			2
as authors use print - on - demand publishing in growing numbers , they seem to be abandoning self - publishing through traditional " vanity presses " -- a method in which authors pay to get their books printed in bulk and then sell them on their own			1
" particularly in this economy , " said @entity120 , " who wants to buy a certain amount of copies of their book ? that really does n't do anybody good			0
" " on - demand publishing is certainly more flexible , " said @entity228 , public relations manager at @entity39			1
" so i think more people are turning to on - demand because it 's a less of a commitment on the author 's part			1
" @entity133 believes traditional publishers can benefit from the services provided by self - publishing companies			1
" traditional publishers are looking at us to find new and upcoming authors , " he said			0
" we provide that for them			0

print - on - demand means digital copies only get printed when someone buys a book
@entity2 decided to self - publish after her book was turned down by agents
@entity177 found success after self - publishing her book
web - based publishing companies are *challenging* traditional publishing houses
