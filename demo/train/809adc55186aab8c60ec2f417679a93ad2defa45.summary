-- @entity3 media outlets have " systematically stirred up " widespread contempt toward the country 's 300,000 - strong @entity6 religious minority , the group says			1
the @entity8 issued a report friday entitled " inciting hatred : @entity3 's media campaign to demonize @entity6			1
" the report " documents and analyzes more than 400 media items over a 16 - month period			2
" the result , the @entity6 say , is an " insidious state - sponsored effort " to discredit the @entity6 with " false accusations , inflammatory terminology , and repugnant imagery			2
" @entity3 officials at the @entity21 and in @entity22 could not be reached for comment			2
among " recurring themes " in media coverage about @entity6 , the report said , is that they are " anti-islamic , " a " deviant " and " cult - like " sect , agents of @entity31 , spies for @entity33 and the @entity34 , morally corrupt and an influence in the shah 's government , toppled in 1979			1
new themes have emerged in recent months , the report says			0
the report says the @entity6 have instigated opposition to the regime , influenced " anti-regime " @entity3 human rights activists , including @entity45 winner @entity44 , controls or influences foreign broadcasters , such as the @entity49 and @entity50 , and helped plan and participated in the 2009 @entity53 protests against the presidential elections earlier that year			1
the group also said the media " uses brainwashing to entice @entity57 away from their faith , " and " security attractive young women to lure converts			2
" " this anti-baha'i propaganda is shocking in its volume and vehemence , its scope and sophistication , " said @entity63 , principal representative of the @entity8 to the @entity21			0
" it 's all cynically calculated to stir up antagonism against a peaceful religious community whose members are striving to contribute to the well - being of their society , " she said			0
" the parallels between the campaign of @entity79 propaganda in @entity3 today and other state - sponsored , anti-religious campaigns of the past are undeniable			0
history shows us that such campaigns are among the foremost predictors of actual violence against religious minorities - or , in the worst case , precursors of genocide			0
" the @entity6 faith , founded during the 19th century in @entity3 and now with 5 million to 6 million adherents worldwide , is a monotheistic religion that focuses on the spiritual unity of humanity			1
but @entity3 's @entity98 ruling ayatollahs regard the faith as blasphemous because its founder , @entity100 , declared himself to be a prophet of @entity101			1
@entity57 believe the @entity102 was the last prophet of @entity101			0
the group said the @entity105 messages are " originates with and are sanctioned by the country 's highest levels of leadership , including @entity110 ayatollah @entity109			0
" @entity3 , however , claims that international media are an arm of a @entity6 conspiracy			1
those claims are " both ludicrous and funny , if it was n't so sad , " said @entity116 , the program coordinator for the @entity118 and @entity119 program			0
" any international media outlet that carries news that is not identical to the @entity3 government 's line is accused of being an agent of fill in the blank : the @entity6 , the @entity127 , the @entity128			1
" the @entity127 @entity129 -- an independent , bipartisan federal agency -- regularly documents the @entity3 regime 's actions toward the @entity6			1
a @entity133 official said the @entity3 government 's media campaign to denigrate and vilify the @entity6 community is part of its long - standing policy to not only incite violence against @entity6 but also to seek a slow death of the community 's very existence in the country			1
" the longer you wear down a community by demonizing them , intimidating them , depriving them , and arresting and imprisoning them - the hope is that you achieve your goal of total eradication , " said @entity144 , deputy director for policy and research at @entity133			0
the @entity6 report cities more than 200 " specious and misleading articles " by the semi-official @entity159 newspaper			1
@entity133 also singles out @entity159			0
" among those responsible for this media initiative has been @entity162 , managing editor of the government - controlled @entity159 newspaper , who was appointed by supreme leader @entity109 himself , " @entity144 said			0
" @entity159 's articles about the @entity6 community have been a combination of vitriol and falsified information that has served to justify many of the egregious actions taken by the government against members of the community			2
as a consequence , @entity133 has urged the @entity127 government to add @entity162 to its sanctions list of @entity3 officials responsible for severe violations of human rights , including religious freedom , " said @entity144			2
@entity181 , @entity3 researcher with the @entity182 and @entity119 division of @entity184 , said rights groups have long documented the government 's " systematic campaign , both in law and practice , to target @entity6 and " deprive them of of their ability to freely manifest the beliefs and teachings of their faith			1
" @entity181 said the " report provides valuable insight into the mechanics of a less documented and more insidious element of this campaign - @entity79 propaganda propagated by official and semi-official media outlets , and the degree to which hate speech further exposes an already vulnerable minority group to discrimination and attacks by private actors			0
