-- some athletes will go to any lengths to get their hands on an @entity4			0
@entity5 and @entity6 are just two examples of champions whose achievements have been scrubbed from the record books due to drug scandals			2
but competitors who want to run the risk of taking performance - enhancing substances before or during this year 's @entity16 will face the most sophisticated anti-doping operation in the history of the @entity19 , according to @entity21 organizers			1
more than 6,250 samples of blood and urine will be tested during both the @entity16 and @entity25 -- four years ago in @entity26 that figure was around 4,500 -- with around 150 scientists on duty around the clock			1
for the first time in @entity16 history , a private sponsor -- pharmaceutical giant @entity34 ( @entity34 ) -- will be aiding the effort , providing the facilities for the scientists to carry out their work			1
the $ 30 million state - of - the - art laboratory in @entity41 , @entity39 is a short distance from the @entity43 in east @entity44 and is fully accredited by the @entity45 ( @entity45 )			1
" i think it 's a significant involvement , " @entity45 's director general @entity46 told @entity0			1
" the laboratory will have everything it could possibly need in terms of equipment			2
if athletes go to @entity44 , they know if they are cheating they are likely to be caught			2
" professor @entity54 , director of @entity56 's @entity55 and chief scientist for the @entity19 , is delighted that @entity34 is helping out			1
" these laboratories are the most high - tech labs in the history of the @entity19 , analyzing more samples than ever before , " @entity58 said			2
with @entity34 's support , @entity58 and his colleagues have been able to develop " super-fast , super-sensitive technologies " capable of detecting prohibited substances			2
" across the range of instrument in the lab , we reckon we can pick up things you have n't even thought of , " @entity58 said			0
" i think we 'll soon be away from the days where designer drugs beat the analyst			0
i 'm hoping this will be the games that actually prove that			0
" @entity46 says the list of banned substances runs to 10 - 15 pages , with hundreds of drugs currently prohibited			2
" the fight continues and the sophistication continues on both sides			1
you find that athletes and those that advise athletes are more sophisticated in what they do than they were 10 years ago , " he said			0
but he says the @entity21 program is " very , very good , " reiterating that drug - takers will be found out			1
" if they are not caught now they can be caught within the next eight years because samples can be re-analyzed			0
" things have moved on significantly since the @entity16 ' most infamous case of drug taking , he says			0
" i do n't think @entity6 would even get to @entity44 nowadays -- i think he would be picked up in advance , and many athletes now who think they can get there will be swept away by pre-games testing , " @entity46 said			1
" there were 80 - 90 athletes who did n't go to @entity26 because of pre-testing and i presume that the same sort of number might arise this time around			0
" after winning the 100 meters final in @entity114 in 1988 , a reporter asked the @entity116 sprinter what was more precious : a world record or the gold medal ? @entity6 chose the latter			0
" why ? " the reporter asked			0
" because it 's something nobody can take away from you , " he replied			0
the message coming from @entity44 2012 organizers this year is , " yes we can , and we will			1

@entity44 2012 organizers *enlist* help of state - of - the - art laboratory for drug testing
*partnership* with @entity34 will see more than 6,000 blood and urine tests during games
