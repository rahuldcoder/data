-- " i got the sailors to lash me to the mast to observe it			0
i was lashed for four hours and i did not expect to escape , but i felt bound to record it if i did			0
" @entity5 had a truly obsessional attention to art , so following in his footsteps is no easy task			1
@entity11 artist @entity10 admits he will draw the line at being tied to a mast for hours on end , but nonetheless he plans to retrace the movements at sea of arguably the greatest maritime artist of all time			1
@entity10 may be relieved to know that the quote attributed to @entity5 by @entity20 after his 1842 painting " @entity22 -- @entity23 off a @entity24 making signals in @entity26 , and going for the lead " -- is now thought to have been apocryphal			1
after all , @entity20 described @entity5 as " at once the painter and poet of the day , " using poetic license in the 24,000 works of art he created , of which more than 60 % were water - themed			1
" his style of painting , i believe , was not necessarily what 's in front of you but what you want to see , " explains @entity10			1
" these fabulous sunsets of his were not necessarily what he saw , he could just come up with a good idea			0
" that 's what makes him such a great artist , while i 'm just a painter			2
so i 'm not trying to emulate his style but the position where he was			2
" following in @entity5 's footsteps has been done before -- @entity11 - born @entity53 artist @entity52 's infatuation was such that he traveled from the @entity53 to study his work and retrace some of the spots where he painted			1
@entity10 , however , is the first to do so for more than 150 years			2
the link between @entity10 and @entity5 is more than just an admiration of his work -- both were born in @entity61 's @entity60 and were shopkeepers ' sons			1
" @entity5 's father was a barber and i 'm sure the @entity67 and @entity68 probably knew each other , " says @entity10 , whose family ran a saddlery business			1
@entity10 's " big undertaking " is to visit 12 to 15 locations from @entity71 in @entity72 to @entity73 in @entity74 , along @entity76 's southern coast			1
the amount of materials and canvases he would have to carry means he may not be able to do the whole trip at once			0
and while @entity5 set off to sea to sketch , @entity10 will travel the 1,000 or so miles to the various ports and harbors			1
but like @entity5 , he too plans to take to the waters and is looking for yachting enthusiasts across the country to help him in his quest			2
" chartering boats is so expensive so i 've contacted some yachting magazines to see if i can get any helpers , " he says			0
" i do n't want to go out for eight hours on some fishing jolly -- no - one wants an artist spoiling the view			0
i 'm just looking for a couple of hours where i can work quickly -- @entity5 's journeys were usually brief -- and throw down some ideas			1
" @entity10 , 56 , spent the majority of his life working in the music industry before coming to painting as a profession			2
while @entity10 is " not really a sailor , " @entity5 had sea legs			1
" @entity5 was a great traveler , " says @entity108 , head of art at @entity61 's @entity110			1
" he liked to travel alone or with intimate friends , who paint the picture of a mariner			0
" they paint a nice picture of him not being bothered by the stormy weather while everyone was being sick he carried on sketching			0
" he was a workaholic that certainly enjoyed the dynamics of the sea , and he had a very good grasp of maritime terminology			2
the sea was constantly imbibed in his dna as an artist			2
" the @entity126 recently hosted an exhibition called " @entity128 , " the first to solely focus on his apparent obsession			0
" whether the story of him being tied to the mast or not is true , it does n't really matter , it 's just a very romantic idea , " explains @entity108			0
" if you take that painting , the title itself is very important			0
the boat 's name is aerial and there is no evidence of a ship by that name then			0
" @entity5 was known to be a very poetic artist so you think of @entity143 in the @entity144 , or else @entity143 the ship on which @entity146 died			2
" at the time , the @entity147 ruled the waves with the world 's biggest navy			0
" that was basically part of the national identity , " @entity108 explains			0
" he 's an artist responding to his history			2
landscape artists by their very nature tend to have a maritime period but it was such a key time			0
" he was born in 1775 when @entity160 had just come back from his second voyage of discovery and the nation was a global sea power			0
it was almost part of his dna from the outset			0
" @entity108 says @entity10 's expedition has echoes of @entity52 's journey , which came shortly after @entity5 's death in 1851 at the age of 76			1
" he traveled the south coast to emulate his artistic idol , and you can see a heavy @entity5 influence in his work , " @entity108 says			1
@entity52 's subsequent work , paintings such as " @entity180 , " were very turner-esque in their use of bold colors and glowing , turbulent skies , as boats were tossed in different directions amid stormy seas			1
more than a century and a half after @entity52 's voyage , @entity10 is following suit			1
