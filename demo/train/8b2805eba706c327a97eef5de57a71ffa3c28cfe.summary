@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 's elusive leader claimed responsibility for a bombing in @entity1 's capital of @entity0 that left dozens dead , but said nothing about the group 's reported mass abduction of schoolgirls that occurred the same day as the explosion			1
a man claiming to be @entity15 made the comments in a video posted online on saturday , saying the group attacked a bus station in retaliation for the what he described as the government 's collusion with the @entity24 in the killing of @entity26			1
" this is a prelude , " said the man , who wore camouflage and held an @entity30 assault rifle , in the video			2
in a warning to @entity1 president @entity34 , the man said : " let me be blunt : i am in your city , near you			0
" @entity39 abduction the video surfaced the same day that an education official said a @entity1 schoolgirl , who was among the 129 kidnapped monday by suspected @entity4 militants , had returned home			1
even so , 84 of the girl 's classmates remain unaccounted for			0
a total of 45 girls are now free , according to a statement from @entity51 state education commissioner @entity50			1
this still unsettled situation began monday night , when militants engaged in a battle with guards at the @entity57 in the northeastern @entity1 town of @entity59 began herding the girls onto buses and trucks and drove off , authorities said			2
but some of the schoolgirls managed subsequently to escape , including 14 on friday and others on previous days , according to @entity50			2
this is a far cry from the @entity69 's previous report that all but eight of the girls had found freedom , a claim that @entity1 's military retracted thursday			0
this retraction spurred fervent criticism of the government , with @entity77 -- the father of one of the students -- blasting it as having resorted to " blatant propaganda " by making a " blatant lie			0
" what is @entity4 ? while the mass abduction is extraordinary , violence in the region has been on the rise			1
that violence was on display monday when a bomb exploded at the bus station in @entity0 during rush hour , killing at least 75 people and wounding more than 100			1
but nowhere has it been more prevalent that in northeastern @entity1 's @entity51 , @entity96 and @entity97 provinces , which have been under a state of emergency since mid-may due to persistent bloodshed there the government blames on @entity4			1
the @entity102 militant group -- who name means " @entity106 education is sin " in the local @entity109 language -- has bombed schools , churches and mosques ; kidnapped women and children ; and assassinated politicians and religious leaders alike			1
@entity4 says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of @entity120 law across @entity122 's most populous nation , which is split between a majority @entity26 north and a mostly @entity126 south			1
the advocacy group @entity127 claims more than 3,000 people have been killed in @entity4 - related violence in the past five years			1
who is @entity15 ? under @entity15 , who took control of the group in 2009 , violence carried out by the group has flourished , according to authorities			0
questions have swirled about @entity15 , including whether he 's dead or alive			0
in recent years , the @entity1 military has touted his death , only to retract its claim after he appeared alive and vibrant in propaganda videos			0
he uses the @entity141 , and analysts describe him as a ruthless loner and master of disguise			0
the @entity24 has put a $ 7 million bounty on @entity15 's head			0
it also designated @entity4 as a foreign terrorist network last year			2
the group is diffuse , and @entity151 does not speak directly with members , opting to communicate through a few select confidants			0
this may be why @entity15 made no mention of the kidnapping of the schoolgirls			2
@entity2 's @entity158 and journalist @entity159 in @entity160 contributed to this report .			0
