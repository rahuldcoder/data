-- @entity2 - winning artist @entity1 has long been passionate about helping others , serving as a @entity5 goodwill ambassador and working with @entity6			2
but his main charitable focus is the @entity8 , which he founded to advocate for children around the world			2
this year , @entity1 served on the @entity12 that selected the @entity13			1
he recently spoke to @entity0 about the @entity13 campaign and his philanthropy			1
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity0 : what 's the mission of the @entity8 ? @entity1 : it 's about children			1
it 's about being their voice			2
our mission is to advocate on behalf of children 's rights and their well - being in three crucial areas : education , health and social justice			2
through our principal project , @entity30 , we combat child exploitation that results from human trafficking -- modern - day slavery			1
children are n't just our future			0
unfortunately , there are children around the world that are being forced into slavery			1
i 've heard those testimonies , and if we do n't do something about it , we 're allowing it to happen at this point			0
so it 's been almost 10 years of intense work educating the world about this			2
little by little , we 're trying to create awareness that this goes on			0
@entity0 : do you have any anecdotes about your work with your foundation ? maybe someone your organization has helped that you 're particularly proud of ? @entity1 : i have many , but rescuing three girls from the impoverished streets of @entity62 in 2002 ... was a rude awakening into the reality of human trafficking			1
it gave me the courage to establish people for children , and drew the route to my path as an activist			0
and just recently listening to a boy who has been empowered by our anti-trafficking and leadership seminars , saying he wants to be a teacher for other children , was uplifting			0
these are moments of grand simplicity and profound awareness			0
@entity0 : why is philanthropic work important to you , and how has it changed your life ? @entity1 : i am convinced that music , like philanthropy , bridges hope			1
once you learn about this heinous crime , you can not turn a blind eye			1
knowing that we have prevented children from falling prey to modern - day slavery or that a life was saved by our awareness efforts is invaluable to our mission and human spirit			1
@entity0 : what was it like being on the @entity12 that selected the @entity13 ? @entity1 : it was a very humbling experience			1
their stories served as inspiration , and they also weave a canvas that [ shows that ] in spite of injustices , there are many warriors of light that make our world a better place			0
@entity0 : the @entity114 campaign honors everyday people doing extraordinary things			2
why do you think it 's important to honor the work that these individuals are doing ? @entity1 : kudos to @entity0 for honoring the work that human beings are doing around the world , because [ these heroes ] are " little gods , " as i call them			1
they are making miracles with nothing			0
they are creating such a beautiful impact on different lives			0
@entity0 : what is a hero to you ? what are the qualities of a hero ? @entity1 : heroes represent the best of ourselves , respecting that we are human beings			1
a hero can be anyone from @entity144 to your classroom teacher , anyone who can show courage when faced with a problem			0
a hero is someone who is willing to help others in his or her best capacity			0
it can be someone teaching another to write , saving someone in danger or giving up your life for another			0
amongst the qualities a hero should have , i would include determination , loyalty , courage , perseverance , patience , focus , intrepidity and selflessness			0
@entity0 : why is important for people to give back ? @entity1 : it nourishes your soul and enhances the meaning of life .			1
