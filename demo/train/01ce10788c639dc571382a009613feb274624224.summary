-- a trial for nine terror suspects accused of having ties to @entity4 opened in a @entity6 court monday , with the main defendant suspected of nearly launching a terror attack just hours before a 2008 @entity10 summit in @entity11			1
that defendant , @entity13 , and her husband , @entity14 , are charged with heading a terrorist cell linked to @entity4 and running a web site that glorified suicide bombings and urged young @entity18 to sacrifice themselves in jihad , or holy war			1
the couple has long enjoyed a notorious reputation among @entity24 counterterrorism services			0
@entity26 's previous husband , @entity25 , had assassinated @entity27 , the head of the @entity29 , in a suicide bombing ordered by @entity31 two days before the september 11 , 2001 , attacks on the @entity33			0
when @entity0 interviewed the couple in 2006 , @entity34 showed how she administered a pro-al @entity4 web forum called @entity38 , which included pro-al @entity4 postings and propaganda videos			2
@entity6 investigators say the web site played an important role in the radicalization of members of the @entity47 - @entity6 group			1
the @entity6 - @entity49 woman was considered an " @entity4 living legend " upon her arrest on december 11 , 2008 , as leaders of the @entity10 's 27 member states arrived in @entity11 for the summit			1
fourteen people were arrested early that morning in one of the largest counterterrorism operations in @entity6 history			1
six eventually were charged with participation in a terrorist group			2
at the time , officials told @entity0 that the alleged cell had connections to a senior @entity4 operative who helped orchestrate the 2006 " @entity66 , " widely recognized as @entity4 's most serious terror attempt since 9/11			1
a senior counterterrorism source with detailed knowledge of the investigation said the alleged cell was connected to the top ranks of @entity4 through @entity14 , a @entity73 @entity72 militant who left @entity6 for the tribal areas of @entity75 in late 2007			1
according to @entity6 counterterrorism officials , @entity14 , a @entity73 citizen , relied heavily on the @entity77 to recruit members to the group			2
the other defendants are @entity6 citizens : @entity81 , @entity82 , @entity83 , @entity84 , @entity85 , @entity86 , and @entity87			2
@entity14 , who has yet to be captured , and @entity88 , who has fled on bail , will be tried in absentia			0
defense lawyer @entity91 said the trial is scheduled to take place four days a week , from monday to march 26			2
a ruling is expected toward the end of april			1
the use of the internet by the suspected @entity4 cell was instrumental in getting approval recently for a law that will give state security agents power to monitor internet usage			1
the law will take effect at the end of the year			2
while the country 's intelligence services previously had some of the weakest @entity77 laws at its disposal , it now has some of the strongest regulations in the world			0
" one of the people involved in the case in @entity6 -- i 'd rather not name her -- is coming forward as someone who is seeking to defend jihad ideology by what 's on the @entity77 , " @entity117 , the head of @entity6 intelligence , told @entity0 in a recent interview			1
" i think that a lot of individuals in these cases -- and @entity128 , too -- have been wrapped up by radicalization on internet site			0
" @entity128 , a native of @entity131 , pleaded pleaded guilty in january 2009 to charges of aiding @entity4 and helping attack a @entity33 military base in @entity135			2
authorities accused @entity128 of firing rockets at the base along with others in september 2008 , and of providing @entity4 with information about the @entity131 transit system and the @entity142			1
@entity128 , 27 , was arrested in @entity75 late in 2008 and is awaiting sentencing			0
he told investigators that about the time he became an @entity4 member , he came across several @entity6 and @entity47 militants			1
he said he met in @entity147 in northwest @entity75 with at least three members of this group , including @entity14 and @entity88 , a @entity6 - @entity49 who once worked as a taxi driver in @entity11			1
in june 2008 , @entity14 wrote an e-mail to his wife , intercepted by @entity33 counterterrorism agencies , in which he claimed to have killed several americans in @entity135 , according to @entity6 legal documents			0
however , @entity14 's list of enemies does not seem to have been limited to @entity33 troops in @entity135			0
on may 11 , 2009 , he issued this threat to @entity6 authorities on his wife 's web site : " if you thought that you could pressure me to slow down through the arrest of my wife , you were wrong			0
it wo n't stop me fulfilling my objectives			0
... the place of my wife in my heart and the heart of all the mujahedeen is greater than ever			0
... surprises are sure to be in store for you in the days ahead			0
those who laugh last , laugh more			0
" @entity0 's @entity177 and @entity178 contributed to this report .			0
