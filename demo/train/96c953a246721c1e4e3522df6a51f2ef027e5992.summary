imagine the delight at unwrapping your @entity1 present in 2043 and discovering you 've been gifted a trip around the @entity4			0
it may seem a little far - fetched right now but it could become a reality if space companies like @entity9 realize their aspirations over the next 30 years or so			1
@entity11 and his children are due to fly in his company 's spaceship on its first commercial flight currently slated for 2014			2
but speaking to @entity18 outside a space conference in the @entity20 last week , the company 's ceo @entity16 said their ambitions extended beyond sub-orbital flights for those first customers			1
" if we can make significant progress on the challenge of reusable space access then i think that opens up all kinds of opportunities in the future , " he said			2
" one of the directions that might open up is high - speed point - to - point travel on @entity35 -- so that you could go from @entity37 to @entity38 in an hour or go from @entity37 to @entity39 in a couple of hours			0
" we may be able to open up the opportunity for habitats in low @entity35 orbit , we could make it more affordable to do longer term flights -- even trips around the @entity4			2
i think he [ @entity11 ] has high aspirations for a lot of these different activities			0
" for the moment , @entity16 said the company is focused on completing the test flight program in preparation for the passenger flights that he said @entity9 aims to run on a weekly basis once the service is established			1
@entity16 later told delegates at the @entity60 space conference that about 650 people had signed up for the trip , and over the next couple of years the company would double the number of people who have been into space since @entity69 's flight in 1961 which heralded the start of human exploration of space			1
but @entity9 is not alone in developing the space tourism business			1
it faces competition from other commercial enterprises trying to attract fee - paying passengers -- and many agencies now offer satellite delivery services			1
@entity78 , set up by @entity80 founder @entity79 , says it is developing technologies to enable human access to space			1
and another private company , @entity84 , has already delivered payloads to the @entity86			2
so with private companies launching services and national space agencies like @entity91 's @entity90 joining the exploration of @entity93 and @entity94 setting off to land a probe on the @entity4 , is a fresh space race emerging ? @entity16 suggests there is a new era dawning			1
" this is a great time , " he told @entity18			0
" there 's a renaissance in space access -- between us and @entity78 and @entity84 and all these companies -- it 's so exciting			1
" i think there 's a very good chance that we 're alive when we actually find another ' @entity35 ' in another solar system -- how profound is that ? " scientists may get closer to that goal if proposed missions outlined at the @entity20 conference get off the ground			1
professor @entity115 explained how one of the @entity118 's candidate missions -- a space telescope called @entity120 -- would help analyze what exoplanet environments are like and whether they might be suitable for life			2
delegates also heard about the plan to send a new probe to the @entity128 system			1
the juice mission ( @entity129 ) aims to explore not only the gas giant but also its three moons @entity132 , @entity133 and @entity134			0
space physicist professor @entity135 said they were interested in finding out if water really is trapped between icy layers on @entity132 and its implications for " watery worlds " beyond @entity35			2
the search for @entity35 - like planets is clearly something that fascinates @entity16 too			0
he believes we will soon be able to detect seasons on other worlds			0
and he 's unlikely to have to wait until 2043 for his first taste of space adventure , having signed up for a seat in his company 's spaceship			0
" i 'm actually a customer as well , " he said			0
" my wife and i bought two tickets in 2005			0
" i think it 's important that i fly because just as @entity11 's flight is such an important signal to our customers that he believes in the system , similarly i need to do that as well			0

a new era begins ?			0
