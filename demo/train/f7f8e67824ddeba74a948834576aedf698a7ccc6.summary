-- in a controversial essay published on his website sunday , popular @entity2 graffiti artist @entity1 criticized the design of @entity6 , referring to the building as a " shyscraper " and a " betrayal			1
" the famously anonymous @entity2 street artist describes the building , which will be completed in 2014 , as " vanilla " and " something they would build in @entity15			1
" he added , " it looks like it never wanted to be built in the first place			0
" according to the @entity19 , @entity1 submitted the op - ed -- entitled " the biggest eyesore in @entity22 is not the graffiti , argues @entity1 , it 's under construction at ground zero " -- and artwork , but the paper declined to publish it			1
" we could n't agree on either the piece or the art , so it was rejected , " @entity29 , a spokeswoman for the @entity19 , told @entity0			1
instead , @entity1 published the scathing piece on his blog , which he has been using to unveil new works of art around @entity22 from his monthlong series " @entity38			1
" " today 's piece was going to be an op - ed column in the @entity19			1
but they declined to publish what i supplied , " @entity1 wrote on his site			1
instead he took his familiar graffiti medium , stenciling , " this site contains blocked messages , " on a wall in the @entity48 neighborhood of @entity49			0
in his essay , @entity1 writes the tower is a construction sign that says @entity22 has lost its nerve			1
" it would be easy to view @entity6 as a betrayal of everyone who lost their lives on september 11th , because it so clearly proclaims the terrorists won , " he wrote			1
@entity22 who were directly affected by the attacks on september 11 , 2001 , were insulted by @entity1 's remarks			1
" i think it 's a disgrace to @entity22 and all the families who lost loved ones on 9/11 , " said former fire department deputy chief @entity67 , whose firefighter son , @entity68 , was one of nearly 3,000 people killed in the attacks			1
" the attacks of september 11th were an attack on all of us and we will live out our lives in their shadow			0
but it 's also how we react to adversity that defines us			2
and the response ? 104 floors of compromise ? " wrote @entity1			2
" he is looking for publicity , " @entity67 said , " i do n't think anyone should care what he says			0
" designed by architect @entity86 of @entity87 , @entity6 is a 1,776 - foot tall , 3.5 - million - square - foot building that includes office space , an observation deck and high - end restaurants , according to the @entity93 website			1
it is one of five skyscrapers to be built at the site			0
" to have the marker in the sky is an important thing for people traveling around the city			0
but as a marker , it also says downtown is back			0
it now has a place that responds to the midtown of @entity22 that was missing for so long , " @entity86 told @entity0 in april 2012			2
during his visit to @entity22 , @entity1 has also referenced september 11 in a street art stencil of the @entity93 in @entity110			1
he placed an orange daisy near where the planes struck the north tower			0
@entity114 , a leading voice for families of 9/11 victims , lost her firefighter son , @entity118 in the attacks			0
" to me it was n't a flower			0
it looked like an explosion , a fire explosion , " said @entity114			0
@entity114 told @entity0 she is not against @entity1			2
" it 's just a pr thing , " @entity114 said			0
" i 'm more concerned with the safety of the building than design			2
" @entity67 looks forward to the new skyscraper			0
" it 's part of our skyline , " @entity67 said			0
" it 's what future generations will look at			0
" @entity137 had planned to show @entity1 's work starting tuesday , but after the artist 's essay , the iconic retailer has reconsidered			1
" due to recent controversial comments , @entity137 has decided to cancel the @entity1 exhibit , " said spokeswoman @entity142			2
the @entity137 in downtown @entity145 is very close to the @entity6 and had to be evacuated after the building was badly damaged on september 11			1
the store was closed for five months before reopening at the same location			0
@entity1 was not directly involved with the show .			2

@entity1 criticizes design of @entity6 , calling it a " shyscraper "
@entity22 affected by 9/11 believe @entity1 's work is a publicity stunt
@entity1 says the building looks plain , like something " they would build in @entity15 "
@entity19 declines to publish op - ed ; @entity1 posts the essay on website
