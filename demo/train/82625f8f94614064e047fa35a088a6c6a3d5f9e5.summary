two prominent newspapers this week used their editorial pages to call for mercy for intelligence leaker @entity3 , with one arguing " he deserves better than a life of permanent exile , fear and flight			1
" the @entity9 and @entity10 make the case for some sort of plea deal or clemency that would allow @entity3 to return to the @entity15 from @entity16 , where he was granted asylum			1
mercy or dropped charges have occurred in past cases of other high - profile whistle - blowers , such as @entity22 , the military analyst behind the leak of the @entity24			1
but in recent years , the @entity15 has aggressively pursued those who leak government secrets			1
here 's a look at how the cases of five prominent leakers -- including @entity3 -- have played out : @entity22 @entity22 was the military analyst who leaked the 7,000 - page @entity24 in 1971			1
the top - secret documents revealed that senior @entity15 leaders , including three presidents , knew the @entity34 was an unwinnable , tragic quagmire			2
further , they showed the government had lied to @entity36 and the public about the progress of the war			2
@entity22 surrendered to authorities and was charged as a spy			2
during his trial , the court learned that president @entity45 's administration had embarked on a campaign to discredit @entity22 , illegally wiretapping him and breaking into his psychiatrist 's office			1
all charges against him were dropped			2
since then , he has lived a relatively quiet life as a respected author and lecturer			2
@entity53 @entity54 pvt. @entity53 , who formerly went by the name @entity56 , was convicted of stealing and disseminating 750,000 pages of classified documents and videos to @entity60 , the online anti-secrecy group			2
a military judge sentenced @entity53 to 35 years -- far less than the effective life sentence that was permitted under law -- minus credit for about 3 1/2 years time served			2
the judge also reduced @entity53 's rank , ordered that pay and benefits be forfeited , and imposed a dishonorable discharge			2
@entity53 has applied for a pardon from president @entity71			1
the @entity71 administration has said it will handle that request no differently than others			1
@entity53 's defenders , including @entity22 , said he was a hero			0
@entity76 @entity76 is the founder of @entity60 , which published hundreds of thousands of secret @entity78 cables and other information taken by @entity53 that gave the group global recognition			0
@entity76 's case remains unresolved			0
for more than a year , @entity76 has been holed up inside the @entity83 to avoid extradition to @entity85 , where he is wanted for questioning over allegations that he raped one woman and sexually molested another			0
@entity76 has repeatedly said the allegations in @entity85 are politically motivated and tied to the work of his website			0
@entity92 's government granted him asylum , but @entity95 authorities have said they will arrest him if he leaves the premises			0
@entity97 in 2005 , retired deputy @entity98 director @entity97 revealed himself to be the whistle - blower " @entity101 " in the @entity100			0
he anonymously assisted @entity105 reporters @entity103 and @entity106 with many of their stories about the @entity45 administration 's cover - up after the june 1972 break - in at the @entity113 headquarters			1
the stories sparked a congressional investigation that eventually led to @entity45 's resignation in 1974			0
the @entity105 won a @entity117 for its coverage			0
@entity97 was convicted on unrelated conspiracy charges in 1980 and fined			0
he was pardoned by president @entity120 before slipping into obscurity for the next quarter century			0
he died in 2008 at age 95			0
@entity3 it 's too early to tell @entity3 's ultimate fate			1
a contentious debate surrounds his case			0
on one side , many see @entity3 as a traitor and criminal for unlawfully taking and disseminating @entity132 files relating to its mass collection of electronic information , including e-mail and phone data			1
others see bravery in @entity3 's actions for bringing a secretive program to light and initiating a national debate about security and privacy			1
" considering the enormous value of the information he has revealed , and the abuses he has exposed , mr. @entity3 deserves better than a life of permanent exile , fear and flight , " the @entity9 editorial said			1
" he may have committed a crime to do so , but he has done his country a great service			0
" still , @entity15 officials have thus far shown no indication they 're considering clemency			1
last month , attorney general @entity159 said the conversation about balance between security and privacy is important , " but i would not say what he did is worthy of clemency			1
" " it 's not something that i would support , " @entity159 said			0
" i think that he has clearly broken the law and harmed the nation that he claims to love			0
" what do you think should happen to @entity3 ? leave a comment below .			1
