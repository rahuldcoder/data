it is a parent 's worst nightmare : your child goes to school , never to return home			1
scores of @entity7 are living that horrific reality after 230 schoolgirls were abducted , allegedly by @entity10 , under the cover of darkness on april 16			1
of the hundreds of girls herded into vehicles , only 43 have escaped			0
and as their parents wait and hope , the government is grappling with an @entity19 terror group that has gotten more brazen			1
so has its abductions of women and girls in northern @entity7 , the region most affected by the insurgency			1
why does @entity10 kidnap girls ? the @entity19 militants ' name translates to " @entity31 education is a sin " in the local language			1
the group especially opposes the education of women			1
under its version of @entity39 law , women should be at home raising children and looking after their husbands , not at school learning to read and write			2
it has repeatedly targeted places of learning in deadly attacks that have highlighted its fundamental philosophy against education			0
the spate of kidnappings began in may 2013 when @entity10 leader @entity53 announced in a video that this was part of its latest bloody campaign			2
the kidnappings , he said , were retaliation for @entity7 security forces nabbing the wives and children of group members			1
those kidnapped , he said , would begin a new life as a " servant			0
" has it kidnapped girls and women before ? yes			1
in november , the militant group abducted dozens of @entity71 women , most of whom were later rescued by the military deep in a forest in @entity76			2
at the time of their rescue , some were pregnant or had children , and others had been forcibly converted to @entity82 and married off to their kidnappers			0
rights groups have said @entity10 has kidnapped girls as young as 12			1
and the abductions are only getting worse			0
in the first two months of this year alone , it kidnapped at least 25 girls and women , according to @entity90			1
what does it do with the women ? the group is always on the move to escape an intensified crackdown by the government , and members leave their wives behind when they scamper into hideouts deep into the forests			2
some girls and women are kidnapped to take the place of wives , and perform chores and sexual services , according to rights groups			1
does it target any particular schools ? those abducted are both @entity71 and @entity112 students enrolled in secular schools			0
not all cases involve kidnappings , however			0
@entity116 and bombing attacks on schools have killed hundreds of children in recent years			0
in february , the @entity7 military blamed @entity10 for killing at least 29 students in an attack on a federal college in @entity124 in @entity125			1
another bloody example came last july , when 20 students and a teacher were fatally gunned down in the same state			0
what are the chances the girls kidnapped recently will be rescued ? it wo n't be easy			2
for one , the hundreds of girls seized most recently from the high school in @entity136 were not in a central location where the government has a firm grip			2
the school is about 80 miles ( 130 kilometers ) west of @entity76 and some 600 miles from the capital of @entity142			0
where exactly they went from there is unknown			0
the area where they are believed to be is remote and heavily forested			0
it 's also close to @entity149 , which means that the captives and captors could slip through the porous borders into nearby countries , including @entity155 or @entity156			2
and the large number of hostages may limit @entity7 's options			1
that means airstrikes employed in the past may not be possible , lest they kill captives in the process			0
a ground assault is n't a great option either -- not when it is done in unfamiliar terrain against entrenched , well - armed fighters			0
who started @entity10 ? @entity170 , a charismatic young cleric , founded the group 12 years ago as part of his push for a pure @entity82 state in @entity7			1
he was killed in 2009 , but his group lived on			0
@entity10 became more violent after his death as his supporters vowed to strike back			2
@entity90 estimates that in the past five years , more than 3,000 people have been killed in the violence			0
its targets include government buildings , police barracks , newspaper offices , village markets , churches and mosques			0
is the group tied to @entity188 ? the @entity189 says the militant group has links to the @entity188 affiliate in @entity193 and to extremist groups in @entity195			2
how closely related @entity10 is to @entity188 is hard to define			2
in one respect , at least , the groups are on par : as of november , they are part of the @entity202 's list of terrorist organizations			2
@entity204 , an offshot of @entity10 , is on the same list			2
what does @entity10 want ? it says its aim is to impose a stricter enforcement of @entity39 law across @entity193 's most populous nation , which is split between a majority @entity112 north and a mostly @entity71 south			1
in recent years , its attacks have intensified in an apparent show of defiance amid the nation 's military onslaught			0
its ambitions appear to have expanded to the destruction of the @entity7 government			0
the northeast , where @entity10 has been most active , is economically depressed and among the least educated regions in @entity7			1
islamists view the most powerful people there as corrupt , and accuses them siphoning off @entity7 's considerable natural resources and assets			1
despite its vast supply of oil and natural gas , the @entity230 says that about 54 % of @entity7 's population can be considered " extremely poor			1
" what is @entity7 doing to combat the group ? last year , president @entity237 declared a state of emergency in three northeastern states -- @entity240 , @entity125 and @entity241			1
this declaration gave the nation 's security forces wide latitude to go after suspected terrorists			0
but rights groups have accused @entity7 of going too far in using heavy - handed tactics such as illegal searches , torture and extrajudicial killings			1
the government 's stepped - up campaign may have emboldened @entity10 to become even more violent			1
@entity254 estimates that at least 1,500 people -- more than half of them civilians -- died in the first three months of 2014			0
" the escalation of violence in northeastern @entity7 in 2014 has developed into a situation of non-international armed conflict in which all parties are violating international humanitarian law , " said @entity256 , an official with that rights group			1
" civilians are paying a heavy price as the cycle of violations and reprisals gather momentum			0
" the campaign has heightened some @entity7 ' skepticism of their government			0
some complain the wide array of criminal activity pinned on @entity10 gives authorities liberties to make arrests or use deadly force with little oversight or consequences			0
in @entity7 , the mass abduction of schoolgirls is n't shocking @entity10 victim : i cried for someone to help me , but no one would come			1

officials : *187* schoolgirls who were kidnapped from a school in @entity7 remain captive
the abduction is blamed on @entity10
the group 's name means " @entity31 education is sin "
rights groups say that the @entity19 group has kidnapped girls and women before
