@entity0 , @entity1 -- to see her playing with her friends , @entity3 seems much like any other child			1
but until last year , the 12 - year - old @entity1 girl led a very different existence , forced to work grueling 16 - hour shifts in a carpet factory in @entity1 's capital , @entity0			1
@entity3 's ordeal began in 2011 when , as a 10 year old , she came to the city for a visit with her uncle			0
little did she know he would force her into becoming one of the country 's estimated 1.6 million child laborers , putting her to work in exchange for money to give her parents			1
for the next year , instead of going to school , she said she was made to work from 4 a.m. to 8 p.m. everyday , with barely any breaks			2
like @entity3 , @entity26 from @entity27 in northeastern @entity1 was also coerced to join the workforce at an early age			1
she said her grandfather brought her to the capital to work because the family needed money			2
" my father was an alcoholic and my mother could n't take care of me , " said the 12 year old			0
" i do n't know why they sent me to work while my two brothers went to school			2
" @entity1 's underage workers though child labor is illegal in @entity1 , an estimated 1.6 million children between the ages of five and 17 years are in the work force , according to the @entity46			1
about three - quarters of them are under the age of 14 , and most are girls			1
child workers are a frequent sight on @entity0 's streets , whether cleaning dishes in local restaurants or making a living as conductors on the city 's public transport			2
many are employed in the carpet , brick and garment industries , or in private homes as domestic workers			1
employers typically see the relationship as a mutually beneficial arrangement , providing the children accommodation and education , as well as a salary that supports their families , said @entity74 , director general of @entity1 's @entity75			2
though working as underage domestic help is defined as child labor , there is a mutual agreement between the children , their parents and the employers , @entity74 said , referring to it as " social adoption			1
" rescued from forced labor thousands of children continue to work as breadwinners for their families			2
@entity3 and @entity26 are some of the lucky ones			0
they were rescued by @entity90 , a local non-governmental organization that works to eradicate child labor within the carpet industry			1
today , they live with more than 30 other children , all under 14 , at the foundation 's transit home in @entity0			0
a regular day at this hostel - like facility is filled with children chattering , playing and attending classes			0
but when they sit and share their past , an eerie hush falls over the room			0
while @entity1 's interim constitution of 2007 guarantees the rights of children , and the country has signed major international conventions against child labor , enforcement is weak			1
under its @entity112 on @entity113 , the country has identified the worst forms of child labor -- bonded labor , domestic child labor and carpet weaving among them -- and aims to eliminate them by 2016			1
it hopes to eliminate all other forms of child labor by 2020			1
in a recent address during @entity123 , @entity124 , country representative of the @entity127 to @entity1 , said that addressing the issue should be a priority			1
however , she said the country lacks the number of labor inspectors necessary to effectively monitor child labor practices in illegal factories , or in residential situations where children are often employed as domestic helpers			1
recently , protests rocked @entity1 's capital following the death of a 12 - year - old girl who was working as a domestic helper in the neighboring district of @entity145			1
@entity146 , a former kamlari or bonded laborer , self - immolated in march because of her perceived academic failures , according to her employers ' testimony to the police			0
while police ruled her death a suicide , activists argued that the girl was ill - treated and her employers should be held accountable for her death			0
in response to the public outcry , the government agreed to form a committee to investigate the case			0
its report is still to be released			0
the modern problem of kamlari while forms of bonded labor have existed in @entity1 for centuries , the contemporary kamlari issue stems from the 1950s , when the eradication of malaria in the country 's @entity173 led migrants from other parts of the country to move in and occupy land traditionally owned by the @entity180 ethnic community			1
with no legal records of their traditional land ownership , the @entity181 were forced to become agricultural laborers for their new landlords and many were forced into debt			0
many @entity180 girls as young as five were sold into indentured domestic servitude by their families as a way of repaying the debts , where they could experience years of unpaid menial labor , violence and abuse , according to @entity198 , herself a former kamlari			2
when @entity1 officially banned the practice in 2000 , an estimated 200,000 bonded laborers from 37,000 households were emancipated , according to the survey statistics from the @entity204 , a non-governmental organization working to eradicate the practice			1
but with the government ban focusing largely on men working in the farms , girls working as child slaves for their landlords were mostly overlooked , said man @entity212 from the @entity213 , a part of the @entity216 - based non-profit @entity215			1
according to @entity212 , some 12,000 kamlaris have since been rescued			0
however , he said , more than 500 girls , especially in @entity219 and @entity221 districts in far - western @entity1 , are still working as child domestic workers			1
a family tradition @entity198 was among those rescued following the 2006 decision by @entity1 's @entity227 to make the kamlari practice illegal			1
" i was born into a family of bonded laborers , " said @entity198 , now an activist and former constitutional assembly member in @entity1 's interim parliament			2
" i was expected and forced to work since i was eight			0
" for the next 18 years , @entity198 said she toiled under harsh circumstances as a domestic worker , serving her landlord in @entity238 in mid-west @entity1			2
she was freed when she was 26			0
now 32 , she has taught herself to read and write , entered politics and successfully contested the 2008 general election			0
despite government efforts , @entity198 thinks while poverty continues to exist in @entity1 , so will child labor			1
" it might be minimized but not completely eradicated , " she said			0
according to the @entity247 's @entity246 , 44.2 % of @entity1 's population lives under the poverty line			2
in extreme cases , some parents send children to work			0
sometimes , children themselves run away in search of a better life			0
while many @entity1 children are still trapped in this abysmal situation , the ones rescued share optimism for a better future -- their traumatic past has not killed these children 's dreams			2
" i want to study and become a counselor so i can help children like myself when i grow up , " @entity3 said			0
@entity26 , on the other hand , said she wants to continue the alpine legacy of her community			0
" i 'm going to climb a mountain someday , " she said			0
" it 'll be @entity272			0

though child labor is illegal in @entity1 , an estimated 1.6 million aged between five and 17 work
about three - quarters of child laborers are under the age of 14 , and most are girls
many are employed in the carpet , brick and garment industries
the country hopes to eliminate the practice by 2020 , but former child laborers are *skeptical*
