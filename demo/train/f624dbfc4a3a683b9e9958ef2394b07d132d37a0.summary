@entity0 did not thank his opponent , @entity1 , during his acceptance speech , after defeating the incumbent with 51.6 % of the vote in the @entity6 presidential runoff			1
but he should have , as he ran an @entity8 campaign , promising to behave like a " normal president " in contrast to the impulsive , unpredictable and sometimes ostentatious @entity1			2
and it worked : fifty - five percent of the voters who cast a ballot for him did it to defeat @entity1 rather than to elect @entity0			1
this victory comes after an odd campaign on both sides			0
@entity1 started off courting the center by emphasizing his record of reforms and his role in solving the eurozone crisis with @entity25 chancellor @entity24			0
but in march , he decided to take a page from his own 2007 campaign and raid the extreme - right electorate of @entity29 instead			0
he emphasized themes like immigration , @entity32 and the necessity for a more protective , even protectionist , @entity34			1
this time , however , the strategy backfired			0
@entity36 got a historic score in the first round , while @entity1 sowed confusion in his own camp -- and lost			0
@entity0 , betting on the @entity8 mood , refrained from making big promises , and even his signature reforms had a lot of fine print			1
for example , he announced that he would recruit 60,000 more teachers -- but by shifting existing civil service jobs from other ministries to education			0
he promised to roll back @entity1 's pension reform -- but for only a tiny fraction of workers			2
he pledged to renegotiate the @entity54 that @entity1 negotiated with @entity24 -- but only to add a growth stimulus , not to alter the new disciplines it imposes			0
his prudence is easy enough to explain : @entity6 debt is close to 90 % of @entity60 , the 2011 deficit was 5.2 % , and @entity0 has promised to rein it in to 3 % in 2013 and zero in 2017 ( @entity1 was promising 2016 )			1
he will be closely monitored by the bond markets and the rating agencies , one of which stripped @entity6 of its triple - a in january			1
that is precisely one of the three big challenges @entity0 will face -- to convince markets he can chart a fiscally responsible course and restore the competitiveness of @entity6 's economy while its southern neighbors are reforming fast and @entity25 is already very competitive			1
this in turn partly depends on a second challenge he faces , fashioning a new @entity79 , and then pan-european , consensus on the eurozone crisis			0
@entity24 was furious when @entity0 announced in december that if elected , he will renegotiate the @entity82			1
she went as far as to refuse to receive him in @entity83 , as is traditional for @entity6 presidential candidates , and to announce that she would campaign for @entity1 -- which in the end she did n't , given @entity1 's own u-turn on @entity34			1
but in recent weeks , the landscape has changed profoundly			0
twelve @entity34 countries are now in recession , and the leaders of @entity92 and @entity93 have asked for balancing fiscal consolidation with growth measures , lest their drastic reforms be altogether rejected by populations suffering from austerity measures			1
this new " growth consensus " even includes @entity99 , president of the @entity100 , who insists , however , on structural reforms rather than a stimulus with public money			0
for the difficult question facing @entity34 leaders is how to stimulate the economy without deepening the deficit			1
@entity0 has put forward suggestions ( pumping up the @entity110 , reallocating structural funds , issuing eurobonds for infrastructure projects , creating a financial transactions tax ) , and there is room for a compromise with @entity24 , who can not afford to be isolated			2
this could take the form of an additional protocol to the @entity82 to make it more acceptable , including to the @entity25 opposition @entity122 , whose votes are needed for ratification			0
for @entity0 , this negotiation will be particularly difficult during his first month in office , because he will face a third challenge -- to win the legislative elections june 10 and 17			2
if he loses , the resulting situation of cohabitation ( divided government ) would be a disaster for @entity6 and the eurozone , as @entity135 would be largely paralyzed			2
this is why @entity0 will be very careful not to antagonize @entity6 voters before the crucial votes			1
fortunately for him , the pressure from the extreme left , which had a disappointing showing in the first round , is low			0
in the longer term , especially after the september 2013 @entity25 elections , much will depend on @entity0 's vision for @entity6 and @entity34			1
an interesting hint of what 's in store might come from a man named @entity150			0
in 1983 , as minister of economy and finance , @entity150 successfully lobbied socialist president @entity152 to stay in the @entity153 at the price of steep austerity			2
and between 1985 and 1995 , as president of the @entity157 , he became one of the founding fathers of the @entity160 , introducing the single market			0
one of his protégés was none other than @entity0 .			2

@entity165 : @entity6 president @entity0 *avoided* making big promises
@entity6 's debt is near 90 % of @entity60 , and the 2011 deficit was 5.2 % , says @entity165
@entity0 has to be fiscally responsible yet restore @entity6 's competitiveness , @entity165 says
@entity172 : @entity34 must find a way to stimulate the economy without deepening the deficit
