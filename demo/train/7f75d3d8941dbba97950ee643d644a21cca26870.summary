-- world champion @entity2 has been disqualified from last weekend 's @entity4 @entity3 in @entity5 after presenting " misleading " evidence to stewards			1
@entity2 has been disqualified from the @entity4 gp after presenting " misleading " evidence to stewards			1
the @entity9 driver and @entity11 's @entity10 were called to an @entity13 hearing in @entity14 -- the site of this weekend 's grand prix -- on thursday to discuss an incident during sunday 's race			1
@entity10 finished third at @entity5 's @entity18 , only to later be handed a 25 - second penalty by race stewards which relegated him to 12th position and saw @entity2 lifted into third			1
however , following thursday 's hearing , @entity10 has been reinstated in third position			2
@entity9 had complained that veteran @entity26 had illegally passed @entity2 under yellow flags following an accident late on involving @entity30 's @entity29 and @entity31 in his @entity32 -- who were running second and third at the time			2
@entity10 had decided not to appeal the original decision but the @entity13 , the sport 's governing body , said it had received new information and pressed ahead with a second hearing			0
" the stewards , having considered the new elements presented to them from the @entity43 , consider that @entity2 , and the @entity9 team , acted in a manner prejudicial to the conduct of the event by providing evidence deliberately misleading to the stewards at the hearing on sunday 29th march 2009 , " the @entity13 said in a statement			1
it said @entity2 and @entity9 had violated its rules and retrospectively disqualified him from the race			2
meanwhile , @entity10 believes justice has been served after thursday 's decision			0
" i am happy because i wanted some justice and i got it , " he told @entity56			0
" i am happy for myself and the team and i have to thank the @entity13 because it does not happen very often they reconsider something			0
" it must have been really hard for them , but they had common sense to really try and understand what was going on			0
i have always been honest and it has paid off			0
