@entity0 -- the @entity2 gave an @entity4 couple another chance wednesday to challenge a government ruling barring construction of their " dream house , " an important property rights defeat for the @entity12 administration			1
the justices unanimously ruled @entity14 and @entity15 can appeal a compliance order that said wetlands on their residential lot were improperly filled with rocks and dirt			1
a building permit was then revoked			2
" since the agency 's decision was final and since the @entity25 have no other adequate remedy in a court , they may bring their suit " under federal law , said justice @entity22			2
the couple 's supporters had billed this as " @entity35 " fight against the @entity34			1
" we 're here to stand up for the property rights and the constitutional rights of all @entity40 , " @entity15 told @entity1 in january , when the case was argued at the high court			1
" we felt blindsided by the @entity34 , and we remain determined to fight			1
" the high court had displayed wide support for the @entity42 during oral arguments 10 weeks ago			0
" if you related the facts of this case -- as they come to us -- to an ordinary homeowner , " justice @entity44 asked the government 's attorney , " do n't you think most ordinary homeowners would say this kind of thing ca n't happen in the @entity40 ? " what happened has become a six - year fight pitting business and property rights groups against the federal government and many in the environmental community			1
the effect could be huge for the longstanding tension over the balance between commercial and private development , and maintaining clean air , water , and soil			0
the @entity42 bought a small parcel of about two - thirds of an acre in the @entity70 in 2005 , near the shores of the resort community of @entity73			0
they hoped to build a three - bedroom home , surrounded by neighbors ' houses , and had obtained a county permit			0
@entity79 had already been laid for the foundation when @entity34 officials told them their land was a wetland			2
they were ordered to immediately " restore " the land to its natural state or risk fines of up to $ 37,500 a day			0
at issue before the high court was whether the @entity25 have a right to have a " timely and meaningful " hearing before a court to challenge a @entity97 wetlands - restoration order of a federal agency			0
about 3,000 administrative compliance orders are issued each year by the @entity34			2
a federal appeals court agreed with the agency that the couple 's only remedy was to go through a lengthy wetlands permit process , which the @entity42 said would cost thousands more than the property is worth			1
" @entity34 is not above the law , " said @entity107 , an attorney with the @entity108 , representing the @entity25 in court			2
" that 's the bottom line with today 's ruling			2
" @entity34 officials said in a statement : " @entity34 will of course fully comply with the @entity2 's decision , which the agency is still reviewing , as we work to protect clean water for our families and future generations by using the tools provided by @entity122 to enforce the @entity97			1
" the @entity34 still maintains the land is a wetland , and says the couple passed up the chance to work with federal officials for an " after - the - fact " permit , which may have resolved the situation quickly and cheaply , a remedy the government says it uses often for individual homeowners			1
but @entity44 , in a concurring opinion wednesday , said for " a nation that values due process , " the bureaucracy the @entity25 endured was " unthinkable			0
" " the combination of the uncertain reach of the @entity97 and the draconian penalties imposed for the sort of violations alleged in this case still leaves most property owners with little practical alternative but to dance to the @entity34 's tune , " he said			1
defining " wetland " and the potential impact on drainage and " discharging pollutants " from nearby land has long been a tricky , subjective process			0
federal regulators for decades have had the authority to protect water quality , even when land is not directly adjacent to streams , rivers , swamps , lakes or oceans			0
the @entity42 property did not border @entity73 , but the @entity34 determined gravel on the lot amounted to a pollutant into " waters of the @entity40			1
" the high court in 2006 failed to reach a standard that would have redefined current wetlands mitigation laws , the laws now confronting the justices and the @entity42			0
" the @entity2 has come to our rescue , " @entity15 said just after the decision was issued , " and reminded the @entity34 -- and everyone -- that this is still @entity40 , and @entity40 still have rights under the @entity176			1
" " we did everything right , " he told @entity1 about the permit process to build their home			0
he said the experience has been " literally terrifying			0
" the case is @entity185 ( 10 - 1062 ) .			0

an @entity4 couple can file suit against an @entity34 ruling , the @entity2 says
the couple 's supporters had billed this as " @entity35 " fight
@entity15 : " we 're here to stand up for the property rights *...* of all @entity40 "
