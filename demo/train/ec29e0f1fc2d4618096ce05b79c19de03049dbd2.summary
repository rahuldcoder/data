@entity1 , @entity0 -- the fears that @entity4 would turn into another human catastrophe on the scale of @entity7 in 2005 have mercifully not been realized			1
the " @entity9 " project aim is to try and make scenes like this a thing of the past			1
but it has been another untimely reminder of nature 's destructive power , and a further taste of what climate scientists are predicting will be far more common spectacle as the century progresses			0
as @entity22 blew itself out , more hurricanes -- @entity25 , @entity26 and @entity27 -- were threatening even more lives and properties			0
but in the face of such relentless disruption can anything be done to lessen the impact of such extreme weather events ? well , researchers at @entity36 certainly think so			1
their " @entity9 " project at @entity38 got underway at the end of august with the aim of making houses more resilient in the face of such violent storms			1
@entity2 caught up with professor @entity44 -- a civil and environmental engineer who is working on the project -- in @entity46 , @entity47 , where he 's been surveying the damage from @entity4			1
" when there are natural disasters the biggest problem seems to be with residential houses , " he said			0
" in @entity54 and in most parts of the world houses are n't engineered			0
so we are taking an engineer 's eye to look at this			0
@entity61 has some peculiar effects which can be mitigated relatively easily			0
the motivation for this project is to make houses safer , but not cost more			1
" unfortunately , building a wind tunnel at a size required to test full - scale buildings just was n't feasible			1
but the equipment and methods chosen by the researchers are a unique and far more efficient way of testing which replicates the pressures that occur on the surface of a building			1
the $ 7 million facility is a large movable steel hanger			0
the full - scale 1,900 square foot house sits inside a steel cage rigged up with 60 pressure boxes which can simulate the effects of a category 5 hurricane ( see photos )			1
professor @entity44 has taken a leading roll in developing the pressure boxes explained how the test has been set up			2
" we have a bunch of air boxes on the roof -- which is made of plywood -- and then we have what are called pressure load activators , " " these are kind of like vacuum cleaners -- they have a hose and are connected to the air boxes			2
the pressure load activators suck air out of the air box and causes a suction which wants to lift the roof "			2
before the experiment in the hanger could begin , researchers calculated the pressures the house would experience in a small - scale study conducted at the @entity36 's @entity111 -- which has over 40 years of expertise testing high - rise buildings and bridges			1
once accurately recorded these results were then scaled up in preparation for the test proper			1
monitored by 20 cameras , the first experiments were conducted over three days and saw the house endure ever increasing winds speeds up to a category 3 hurricane			1
initial tests have produced some unexpected results			2
" the thing that surprised us most is where it [ the roof ] failed first			1
it failed on the leeward side of the house			1
we had all expected it to fail on the windward side first , " @entity44 said ( see video )			1
" if you looked at the house now , the roof is n't actually connected to the walls			1
but you 'd look at the house and say it looks ok			2
" another thing was that the failures were progressive			0
there was n't one real gust of wind that broke it			0
the damage accumulated , " @entity44 said			0
having now understood the house 's behavior under stress , @entity44 and his team will now set about recreate the experiment but this time measuring the load on the nails which lifted			2
" these are more scientific than engineering experiments currently , " @entity44 said			0
" but we can now develop numerical models and look at other roof structures with a lot more confidence as to how these models work			2
ultimately we want to try some mitigation strategies			0
" it 's still early days though and the tests are set to carry on for the next few years			2
" @entity167 always takes time , " @entity44 said			0
" we want to make houses which are safer for people and to do it in a way that does n't break the bank			0
it should be done in an efficient way so that it is affordable to everyone			0
not just high - end houses , but for poor people too			0

@entity181 researchers test roof on full - scale house under hurricane conditions
early results reveal that leeward rather than windward side of roof failed first
" @entity9 " project aims at structural *improvements* that are available to all
