@entity3 fighters entered the besieged @entity5 @entity1 city of @entity6 , a @entity1 fighter said friday , setting the stage for a vicious street - to - street battle in the shadow of @entity11 's border			1
@entity12 , a fighter with the @entity14 , or @entity15 , told @entity16 that @entity3 now controls the southwest corner of the city , known in @entity19 as @entity20			1
however , there were conflicting reports			0
the @entity23 , a @entity24 - based monitoring group , said it did not believe that @entity3 was in the city itself based on information from more than a dozen sources in @entity6			1
on friday , @entity3 released a short video showing the apparent beheading of @entity32 aid worker @entity31			2
in the same video , the group threatens the life of another hostage , @entity38 aid worker @entity37			0
in the same video , the terror group threatened the life of an @entity38 aid worker			0
since august , @entity3 has beheaded @entity38 journalists @entity42 and @entity44 , and @entity32 aid worker @entity45			2
if @entity3 , also known as @entity3 and the @entity46 , takes @entity6 , it will control a complete swath of land from its self - declared capital of @entity50 , @entity5 , on the @entity51 to the @entity11 border , more than 60 miles away			1
thousands of civilians have fled the predominantly @entity1 city in northern @entity5 in recent days as @entity3 forces apparently have advanced inexorably toward it			1
the @entity58 extremist group 's reported entry into the city comes a day after @entity11 lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to authorize military force against @entity3 in @entity62 and @entity5			1
@entity63 decided hours later to join the @entity38 - led air campaign against @entity3 in @entity62			1
@entity11 prime minister @entity65 vowed to help the @entity1 fighters defend @entity6 from @entity3			1
" we would n't want @entity6 to fall , " he said			2
" we welcomed our brothers who came from @entity6			2
we 'll do whatever we can to prevent this from happening			0
" for months , @entity3 has been advancing , capturing portions of northern and eastern @entity5 and western and northern @entity62 for what it says is its new @entity74 state , or caliphate			1
the fighting has only intensified in the region in recent days , with @entity3 nearly surrounding @entity6 , not far from @entity11 's border			1
remaining civilians were ordered thursday to evacuate and headed to the border , as @entity1 fighters declared their readiness to take on the @entity3 militants in street warfare			1
snipers take aim @entity15 fighters are now using snipers in an effort to prevent the @entity3 militants from advancing farther , @entity12 said			1
on the eastern edge of @entity6 , city defenders destroyed an @entity3 tank , @entity12 said , but on the western side , @entity3 now controls an area called @entity95 , which includes an informal border crossing			1
@entity97 , a @entity98 fighter in @entity6 , gave @entity16 the same information on the @entity3 advance into the southwest of the city , in a separate phone conversation			1
he said there were about 300 @entity98 fighters battling alongside the ypg in the city			0
a @entity16 team nearby could hear bursts of small arms fire -- suggesting close - quarters fighting -- that appeared to be coming from around the southwest part of the city			1
a sustained bombardment by @entity3 rained down , particularly on the eastern side of @entity6 , perhaps the heaviest seen in days			1
people still in the city told @entity16 they expected @entity3 to enter soon and were ready for bloody street - to - street fighting			2
they believed they would have the upper hand , at least to start with , because they know the city			0
one @entity1 fighter , who gave only his first name , @entity123 , told @entity16 on thursday that they were not afraid to die if necessary			1
" we know what will happen if @entity3 takes over our town and what they will do to us , " he said			0
" our fight is not just for the @entity1 , it is a fight for all of humanity			0
when people are getting their heads chopped off and tossed aside like animals , it is a duty to fight			0
" big shift for @entity11 the mood of @entity11 's leaders changed in recent days , with @entity3 on the nation 's doorstep and tens of thousands of people fleeing across its border			1
the @entity143 voted 298 - 98 to not only to let the country 's military leave its borders to go after @entity3 and other terror groups , but also to allow foreign troops to launch operations from @entity11			1
the authorization , which came as @entity3 fighters laid siege to towns just south of the @entity11 border , takes effect saturday			1
it is a big shift for @entity11 , a @entity158 member , which until now offered only tacit support to the @entity38 - led coalition of about 40 nations going after @entity3 in @entity62 and @entity5 in various capacities			1
the prime minister submitted a motion declaring that @entity11 was seriously threatened by the chaos in @entity5 and @entity62			1
on friday , @entity5 accused @entity11 president @entity167 of turning his country " into a springboard of aggression against @entity5 under the false claim of fighting terrorism and protecting @entity11 's national security , " according to letters from the @entity175 and @entity176 to the @entity177 , @entity5 state news agency @entity166 reported			1
the ministry said @entity11 was responsible for " every single drop of blood that has been shed in @entity5 " because it provided political , military and logistical support to terrorist organizations and was a conduit for militants traveling to @entity5			1
@entity38 airstrikes have been directed against @entity3 positions in the @entity6 area this week			2
but @entity189 said there were no further strikes in the area overnight into friday			0
in a statement , @entity193 press secretary @entity192 praised the decisions by @entity11 , @entity63 and @entity196 to authorize military force against @entity3			1
" we will continue to work with our international partners to expand our sustained and comprehensive approach to degrade and ultimately defeat @entity3 through a variety of means , including military actions , efforts to stop terrorist financing , countering flows of foreign fighters into the region , and delegitimizing @entity3 's extremist ideology , " the statement said			2
@entity16 military analyst lt. col. @entity211 told @entity16 on thursday that as the @entity3 militants get closer to the city , targeting becomes much more difficult			2
while @entity6 residents were ordered to evacuate , many have refused			0
this means civilian casualties are probably also a concern , he said			0
special forces @entity63 prime minister @entity221 , speaking friday after the @entity223 's decision to authorize airstrikes and the deployment of special forces in @entity62 , said @entity3 had " effectively declared war on the world " and posed a threat to @entity63 and its people			1
@entity3 must be disrupted and degraded , he said , and " it is absolutely in @entity63 's national interests that this mission go ahead			2
" the @entity223 authorized the deployment of @entity63 special forces into @entity62 to " advise and assist " @entity62 forces , @entity221 said , subject to final legal approvals from @entity62			1
@entity63 aircraft began flying support missions over @entity62 this week			2
@entity221 warned that the deployment to @entity62 could be " quite lengthy , " lasting months rather than weeks , but that it would be no longer than strictly necessary			0
" yes , it is a combat deployment , but it is an essentially humanitarian mission to protect the people of @entity62 and ultimately the people of @entity63 from the murderous rage of the @entity3 death cult , " he said			1
@entity221 said @entity63 's special forces would support @entity62 forces , in a way similar to those sent by the @entity38 , which already has " quite a substantial special forces component on the ground , " he said			2
@entity63 has six @entity253 strike fighters based in the @entity254 , and @entity143 has authorized the use of up to eight , said air chief marshal @entity256			2
@entity63 authorities believe that there are at least 60 @entity63 fighting in the @entity259 with terrorist groups , chiefly @entity3 , and that at least 100 more support terrorist groups through funding and recruitment			2
counterterrorism police have carried out raids in @entity63 in recent days			0
on friday , @entity267 prime minister @entity266 presented a motion before the @entity269 about the possibility of his nation taking part in military operations against @entity3 in @entity62 , including airstrikes			1
the lower house of @entity143 is debating the issue			0
retired @entity38 gen. @entity277 , who is coordinating the international effort against @entity3 , said that he expects a campaign against @entity280 within a year			0
" @entity280 is going to be a pretty important battle , " he said			0
" this was the place where [ @entity3 leader ] @entity283 exposed himself , it 's the place where the difficulties of the @entity286 [ @entity287 ] began to cascade			0
... i would say @entity280 will go as an operation within a year			0
" @entity277 also said @entity3 's financial structure must be attacked			0
" a single round of air strikes will not defeat the enemy , " he said			0
" [ @entity3 ] operates in the financial space , and generates a lot of revenue , and while the counterattack against @entity3 in the physical space is underway , there is going to be a concerted effort in the financial space also to try to deny it the revenue it generates every day , that gives it the oxygen it breathes			0
... " a father 's plea the father of @entity32 @entity3 hostage @entity309 , a journalist captured nearly two years ago , said he felt " great relief " when his son appeared in a video message showing he was still alive recently , along with a " feeling of despair and helplessness			0
" " i want @entity277 to know how very proud i am of him , " @entity317 said in a video message delivered from a hospital bed			0
" i can think of no greater joy than seeing my dear son released and allowed to return home to those that love him			0
" @entity309 is the latest hostage to be paraded out by @entity3 and forced to deliver the group 's propaganda			0
in a video released thursday , @entity309 -- wearing an orange shirt and seated alone at a desk with a black backdrop -- said he is sending what will be the first in a series of messages on behalf of the group			0
@entity309 , a photojournalist who also wrote several articles for major @entity32 newspapers , was kidnapped in november 2012 along with @entity38 journalist @entity42			0
@entity3 released a video of @entity42 's beheading last month			0
this month , the group released videos showing the slayings of two other @entity346 hostages , @entity38 journalist @entity44 and @entity32 aid worker @entity45			0
in his video message to @entity3 , @entity317 , 81 , said : " to those holding @entity277 -- please know that he is a good man , he sought only to help the @entity5 people and i ask you , from all that is sacred , to help us and allow him to return home			2
