one man more interested than most in what president @entity1 will have to say in his address to the nation wednesday night is @entity6 leader @entity5			1
in his hideout somewhere in @entity8 or @entity9 , he will likely be hoping that the president sets out a plan to exterminate the @entity11 in @entity12 and @entity14 ( @entity13 ) , a group that has eclipsed @entity6 and made @entity5 seem virtually irrelevant			1
@entity5 and the core of @entity6 are locked in battle with @entity13 for the leadership of the global jihadist movement -- offering very different visions and strategies			1
@entity13 was expelled from @entity6 in february after rejecting @entity5 's demand that it restrict its activities to @entity12			1
@entity13 has captured the imagination of a new generation of jihadists -- from @entity27 and @entity28 states alike -- with its ruthless pursuit of a @entity30 , dramatic territorial gains and relentless propaganda machine			1
its chilling brutality toward non-muslims and @entity35 who do n't share its rigid interpretation of @entity38 echo the behavior of its predecessor , @entity6 in @entity12 , whose vicious attacks on @entity35 and moderate @entity42 drew the ire of the @entity45 leader , @entity44			1
in short , @entity13 ' " traipse through @entity12 represents a serious organizational , strategic , and ideological blow to @entity6 , " analyst @entity46 wrote in foreign affairs in june			1
so far , the leaders of @entity6 affiliates have remained loyal ( if not enthusiastically ) to @entity5			1
after the death of its leader @entity53 last week , @entity51 quickly reiterated its allegiance to the @entity6 leader , and @entity57 , @entity6 's no. 2 , remains at the helm of @entity59 ( @entity59 )			2
prominent jihadi preachers like @entity61 and @entity62 have blasted @entity13 for deviancy			2
appealing to a new generation of jihadists but the younger generation of jihadists appears to be more impressed by action than sermons			0
@entity6 foot - soldiers -- from @entity71 , @entity72 , @entity73 and elsewhere -- are flocking to @entity13 ' standard			1
to them , its leader @entity75 is confronting the apostates and building the @entity30 , while @entity5 talks			0
it 's impossible to know the scale of this exodus			0
but last week , a group calling itself the @entity83 of the @entity11 in @entity71 released a video pledging allegiance to @entity86 , calling him the " caliph of the @entity35 ... the mujahid in the first row of attack against @entity92			0
" even @entity59 -- the most effective of the group 's affiliates -- has expressed solidarity with @entity13 fighters , condemning what it calls the " declaration of war " by the @entity92 on @entity35 in @entity12 , and calling on " all @entity38 groups to support their brothers by afflicting @entity92			1
" by contrast , it 's been a long time since @entity6 central has carried out any attack of note			2
four years ago , a strategy document set out ideas for attacking targets such as cruise ships , dams and bridges as well as aircraft			0
but very little beyond " lone wolf " attacks by distant sympathizers of @entity6 has happened since			2
over the last three years , the most significant terror attacks against western interests have been against the @entity92 @entity119 compound in @entity120 , @entity72 , where there may have been some involvement by members of @entity6 affiliates ; the gas plant in southern @entity126 in january 2013 , carried out by a maverick group that pledged allegiance to @entity6 but does not appear to have been acting on its instructions ; and the @entity130 in @entity131 , @entity132 -- the work of @entity51 , apparently planned without reference to the @entity6 leadership , even if it was exactly the sort of operation @entity5 had urged			2
attacks against @entity92 military , diplomatic and government targets in @entity9 have largely been the work of the @entity142 and @entity143 , though @entity6 fighters are enmeshed with these groups			2
some @entity6 affiliates have been forced on the defensive over the last couple of years			2
the @entity150 intervention in @entity151 pushed back groups linked to @entity153 ( @entity153 ) , which had taken over half the country			0
@entity59 seized and then lost several towns in southern @entity71 in early 2012 , and resorted to suicide bombings and fighting @entity71 government forces from remote hideouts			0
@entity51 lost its leader @entity53 in a @entity92 missile strike last week and has lost large areas of @entity161 it once controlled to ground offensives by @entity132 , @entity163 and @entity165 forces			0
it has also suffered vicious infighting			0
and in @entity8 , the army has gone on the offensive against the @entity8 @entity142 -- an @entity6 affiliate also riven by division -- in the @entity172 tribal area			2
@entity6 strongholds still exist there are still plenty of places where @entity6 supporters are active and their operations growing : eastern @entity72 , @entity14 and the @entity179 in @entity180 , where they have found breathing space amid a collapse of state authority			1
but amid these fast - moving events , @entity5 has seemed more the cheerleader than the leader , reacting to events rather than directing them			0
last week , in an effort to reclaim relevancy , he announced the creation of @entity6 in the @entity192 , led by @entity193 , which will include at least one faction of the @entity8 @entity142			2
according to a translation by the @entity196 , the new offshoot 's spokesman , @entity197 , said its basic goals included jihad against @entity92 , supporting the @entity142 and establishing a @entity30 ( implicitly rejecting the @entity30 claimed by @entity86 )			0
the announcement steps up the philosophical battle between @entity6 and @entity13 about how the dream of the @entity30 , to which @entity35 the world over would owe allegiance , is achieved			1
@entity197 spoke of " a caliphate where the emirs are proud in their closeness to the honest scholars ... a @entity30 in whose shadow even the disbelieving people of @entity212 ( @entity214 citizens of an @entity38 state ) have a life of safety and security			0
" the last condition was clearly aimed at @entity13 and its merciless campaign against non-muslims and @entity222 in both @entity12 and @entity14			1
not to be outdone , @entity13 ' propaganda machine recently posted photographs showing residents of the @entity12 city of @entity227 enjoying " prosperity ... under the shade of the @entity30			1
" @entity6 's hope for the future @entity5 may be looking to the withdrawal of most @entity92 combat forces from @entity9 as his best chance of reviving @entity6 's fortunes			0
last week 's announcement reiterated @entity6 's allegiance to @entity142 leader @entity238 as the leader of the @entity240			0
several analysts have also noted a stream of statements from @entity6 that hint at the coming of a " counter-caliphate			0
" @entity246 and @entity247 pointed out in @entity248 that despite the @entity92 surge in @entity9 , " the remote provinces of @entity250 and @entity251 are home to significant cadres of @entity6 fighters , and @entity6 continues to operate side by side with its allies in other parts of the country			0
" there is also the prospect -- or as some would say , likelihood -- that @entity13 will over-reach much as did its predecessor , @entity6 in @entity12 -- alienating the @entity42 tribes , taking territory it can not defend and mobilizing more enemies than it can resist			1
if the coalition now building against it can split @entity13 ' @entity14 and @entity12 possessions and prize cities like @entity276 from its grasp , the momentum crucial to its success and appeal will be lost			1
the @entity1 administration seems poised to borrow a page out of its strategy against @entity6 to deal with @entity13			1
last week , deputy national security advisor @entity281 noted : " we 've been able to significantly degrade @entity6 core in @entity9 and @entity8 , decimate its leadership ranks , reducing the threat that they pose			0
" now a repetition in @entity12 of the @entity92 strategy that reduced @entity5 to a spectator may be his best chance of overcoming the challenge posed by @entity13			1
the risk is that @entity293 and its allies will neglect imminent challenges in @entity9 while refocusing on the militant challenge in @entity12			0
we 've seen that movie too .			0
