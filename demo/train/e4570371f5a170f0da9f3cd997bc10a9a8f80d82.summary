@entity0 , @entity1 -- as it entered its second week , the @entity4 murder trial turned into an episode of " csi , " replete with gory autopsy details and photographs of the crime scene			1
even the bathroom door through which he shot his girlfriend , @entity12 , was reassembled and put up in court			1
drama from the trial came from a police expert swinging @entity4 ' cricket bat at the door in court to try to determine whether he was wearing his prosthetic legs when he did it			1
it came as well from detailed descriptions of the damage hollow - tip bullets do to human flesh			0
and then , of course , there was the effect of the evidence on @entity4 himself , who spent hours vomiting as he was forced to relive seeing @entity12 's mortal wounds			1
the sprinter admits that he killed @entity12 , his 29 - year - old girlfriend of about four months , on @entity35 2013 but says it was a terrible accident , not premeditated murder			1
@entity4 , 27 , is pleading not guilty to murder and three other weapons charges			1
prosecution and defense battled all week over the meaning of four types of evidence			0
one : the autopsy @entity12 died of multiple gunshot wounds , including one that passed through her brain from above her right eye to the base of her skull , pathologist @entity46 testified			1
that wound was probably almost instantly fatal , he said , but either of the two other bullets that hit her in the hip and the right arm could have been fatal on their own , he said			0
she also had a wound between the fingers of one hand , he explained			0
the angle of the bullet that fractured her skull suggested she might not have been standing when she was hit , @entity46 said			0
the bullets that hit her were hollow - tipped , designed to cause maximum tissue damage , he testified			0
@entity12 was wearing @entity72 shorts and a black sleeveless top when she died , @entity46 said			2
there 's no dispute that @entity4 fired the bullets that killed @entity12 through his bathroom door , so the most important area of debate from the autopsy was the state of food in her stomach			1
@entity46 said it suggested she had eaten about two hours before she died , which contradicts @entity4 ' version of events that they had been asleep in bed for hours before the killing			2
@entity4 ' defense lawyer , @entity92 , fought tooth and nail to cast doubt on @entity46 's finding about the stomach contents , but @entity46 gave no ground			2
two : the door the actual door through which @entity4 fired the bullets into @entity12 was on display in court for much of the week , a mock - up of the toilet room behind it			1
four bullet holes and several other marks in the wood were clearly visible			0
prosecution and defense disagree on whether @entity4 put his legs on before or after bashing the door with a cricket bat to get to his girlfriend			1
police forensic analyst @entity116 testified that the angle of the bat marks in the door indicated @entity4 was still on the stumps of his legs at that point , demonstrating in court the angle of the swing			1
but the defense disputed his version , with two lawyers from the @entity4 team taking their own swings at the door during a break , then making @entity116 swing on the door from his knees			2
@entity116 insisted that the stances the defense made him adopt were " unnatural , " to which @entity92 responded : " unnatural for you			0
" there was also discussion of another mark in the door that @entity116 said was not from a cricket bat			2
the defense says it 's where @entity4 kicked the door with his prosthetic leg before going for his bat			2
@entity116 said that was a possibility but refused to accept it was the only explanation			0
he said he had not tested the mark because his assignment had been only to check the cricket bat marks			0
there was also discussion about footprints that appeared on the door in some photos but are not there now			0
@entity116 said they were consistent with police shoes			0
@entity92 used their disappearance to suggest the door had been handled sloppily by police -- stepping on it when it was on the floor and later wiping the marks off -- to cast doubt on its reliability as evidence			0
three : police photos of the house the court saw more than 150 photos of @entity4 ' house taken by police in the hours and days after @entity12 was killed , showing shocking images including a blood - spattered toilet and the @entity183 's gun , still cocked , on a blood - stained floor			1
the position of several key objects could help determine whether @entity4 is telling the truth about the events leading up to @entity12 's death			1
attention focuses on the position of spent bullet cartridges on the floor , two iphones and the fan that @entity4 says he went out onto his balcony to get before the heard the noise which he thought was a burglar			2
the photos also show the trail of blood from the bathroom to the lower floor from when @entity4 carried @entity12 's body down the stairs			1
four : phone records @entity4 and several of his neighbors made calls to security in the minutes after the shooting			2
the record of the calls between about 3:15 and 3:22 a.m. have helped establish a timeline of events , even as witnesses dispute who called whom and when			0
ex-police commander 's testimony aids defense			0
