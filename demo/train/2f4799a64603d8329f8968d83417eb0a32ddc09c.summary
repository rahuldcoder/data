-- @entity1 will start a @entity3 race from first on the grid for the first time in his short top - level career after outshining motorcycling 's big names in qualifying for sunday 's @entity10 @entity3			1
the 27 - year - old gave the @entity13 team its first pole position since the late @entity15 topped the timesheets at @entity17 just over a year ago			1
the @entity18 , whose best race finish is fifth since his debut in motorcycling 's elite class in 2010 , headed off @entity25 's @entity24 rider @entity23 and @entity27 's world champion @entity26 at @entity28 on saturday			2
it is the first time since that @entity31 race last june that pole has not been won by @entity26 , @entity33 or @entity34 " i 'm really happy for myself and also pleased for the team			2
this pole position has n't happened by coincidence -- it is the fruit of a lot of hard work from all the guys who have all been giving 100 % and sometimes a little more , " @entity1			1
" the conditions today were strange and difficult but we managed to find a good setting , i was up front for the whole session and set my fastest lap on my own			0
" it started to rain for the last few minutes and nobody was able to improve their time but i still had a fresh tire to use and made a couple of mistakes on my best lap , so could have gone faster too			0
tomorrow i start on pole and have a good race pace , so hopefully we can convert it into a good result			0
" series leader @entity33 will head the second row for @entity25 , almost half a second off @entity1 's fastest time , with @entity27 's @entity34 fourth and another @entity18 -- @entity61 on a @entity62 -- setting the fifth quickest lap. @entity24 rider @entity64 was seventh fastest , with his seven - time world champion teammate @entity65 back in 10th after another disappointing session			1
@entity33 , the 2010 world champion , leads @entity26 by 20 points in the championship standings after winning three of five races so far this season -- including the last two in @entity72 and @entity73 .			0
