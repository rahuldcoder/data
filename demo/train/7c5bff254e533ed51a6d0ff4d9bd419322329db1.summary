game developer @entity0 is ready to take role playing to the next level by adding voice commands via the @entity6 controller to its wildly popular video game , " the @entity8 : @entity8 "			1
@entity8 , the second highest grossing game of 2011 , takes players on an epic campaign as a warrior born with the blood and soul of a dragon			2
the game offers many adventures and quests , and players are free to roam and accept challenges as they wish			0
the @entity6 functionality in @entity8 will be available in five languages -- @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26			1
the @entity22 version is expected to be released during the week of april 23 with the other versions following close behind			1
called " @entity33 , " @entity0 began formulating the idea of merging @entity6 's voice capabilities to " @entity8 " shortly after the game 's release in november			1
@entity34 , vice president of marketing and public relations for @entity0 , told @entity36 in an exclusive interview before the official announcement that the developer wanted to add functionality that did n't exist in the original release			0
" when you do things , like when you are on the map , you uncover a lot of map markers and quests to go to a particular place			0
[ with @entity50 ] you can use voice commands to do things very easily , to jump to different cities on the map , " @entity34 said			1
" even doing things in inventory like sorting by weight , by value -- that functionality does n't exist in ' @entity8 ' as it is			2
with @entity6 , it unlocks a lot of new options			2
" @entity34 said the development team also wanted to enhance gameplay			0
voice control naturally leant itself to " shouts , " special vocal powers that the players have access to in the game			2
" you have your full arsenal of shouts available using @entity6 without having to stop , go to a menu , pick the one you want to use , and go back in the game and use it , " he said			2
" you just say the @entity77 , and as long as you have the ability , your character will just use it on the fly			0
" @entity6 will also let players use voice commands to arm weapons , activate spells and tell your companions what to do			1
the commands are designed to be intuitive , and @entity88 , general manager of @entity89 , said @entity6 support will add more than 200 voice commands to the game , providing a new level of access for fans that goes beyond the controller			1
" working closely with the talented team at @entity0 , they have done an amazing job of honoring the core gameplay functionality fans of " the @entity8 : @entity8 " know and love and using @entity6 voice control integration to complement and strengthen the core experience without changing the fundamental game mechanics , " @entity88 said			1
while two other games ( " @entity106 " and " @entity107 " ) also use the @entity6 for voice control , @entity88 said allowing players easy access to menus and inventories , and to quickly create and load saves during gameplay is unique to " @entity8			1
" however , do n't get the idea you 'll be waving your arms around in front of @entity6 as you fight a dragon			0
combat and casting magic will still be done through the handheld @entity123 controller			1
but simple actions that could be done through menus will be available easier with the @entity6			0
" ( totally replacing the handheld controller ) would be a whole other can of worms , " @entity34 said			0
" doing combat and swinging your sword and all that stuff without a controller would dramatically change the game			0
we 're trying to enhance the experience as we designed it with some additional functionality			0
" @entity34 said the @entity6 functionality will be an update to the existing game that will automatically download when @entity0 is ready to release it sometime later this month			0
players wo n't have to do anything to enable the voice commands and will have the option to turn the @entity6 functionality off if they choose			1
the idea to merge @entity6 with @entity8 came from one of the game 's designers after the its release last year			2
during a " game jam , " where game designers are given a week to work on whatever they want as long as it is related to the title , @entity155 , a programmer on " @entity8 , " came up with the idea of using voice commands to do things within the game			1
" he deserves a lot of the credit for putting the time in to get it to work and then working with @entity164 on some of the extra bits that they helped us out with , " @entity34 said .			0
