" this morning , about 500 opposition supporters along with some @entity17 hardliners protested outside the army headquarters , shouting slogans , and some police officers mutinied and joined them , " @entity11 's spokeman said			1
" and so , the president was in a situation where he could either tell the army to forcibly crack down on the protesters or he could step down			1
" this is a situation where the first democratically elected president in the @entity2 is taken down by a former dictator and his supporters , " the spokesman said			1
@entity11 said in a nationally televised address that he was stepping down because he did n't feel he was able to maintain security and peace in the country , which attracts hundreds of thousands of tourists every year			1
strategically located in the @entity13 but extremely poor , the country is threatened by rising sea levels			0

vice president @entity43 was sworn in as president shortly after @entity11 resigned			1
but journalist @entity45 , who is at work on a book about the @entity2 , suggested @entity43 is a puppet who would not last			2
" he comes from a very small political party			0
he 's respected as an academic " but has little support of his own , @entity45 said			0
" i doubt how long they will allow this man to remain in power			0
" @entity45 said he felt the coup was " the end of democracy in the @entity2			2
it throws the whole notion of democracy out of the window			0
" and that is a cause for international concern , he said			0
" here was the country 's first democratically elected president and he was forced to resign by a cocktail of religious extremists , the brother of the former president ... forces like businessmen who are also members of @entity73 , and then the police force , which was always loyal to the former dictator , " he said			1
the police officers appeared to have sided with the @entity79 , which is loyal to former president @entity80 , who ruled @entity81 for 30 years before @entity11 defeated him			1
@entity11 had faced strong criticism in recent months from opposition groups calling for @entity17 to play a greater role in the running of the country , spurred in part by the supporters of @entity80			1
the country is more than 98 % @entity17 , according to a 2011 @entity91 report on the global muslim population			1
the coup signals a rise in extremism , @entity45 said			0
" it 's going from being one of the most moderate @entity17 nations on @entity99 towards extremism , " he said			1
the different political parties in the country , an archipelago of almost 1,200 coral islands south - southwest of @entity105 , planned to meet tuesday afternoon to discuss the next step , said @entity107 , a spokeswoman for the @entity79			1
in 2008 , @entity11 became the country 's first democratically elected president in 30 years			1
the nation was rocked by violent protests last year that @entity11 accused @entity80 's supporters of orchestrating			1
but demonstrators said at the time they were protesting economic conditions , created by reforms imposed by @entity11			2
the government also clashed with opposition groups in december over the issues of massage parlors and the sale of pork and alcohol in resorts			0
tuesday 's events unfolded after about 200 policemen gathered in @entity128 in the capital , @entity130 , according to @entity131 , an executive producer at the state tv station			1
a peaceful standoff with members of the @entity81 defense forces in the square turned violent early tuesday morning , he said , describing the situation in @entity130 as " chaos			0
" the policemen took over the state tv station later tuesday morning			2
they changed its name from the @entity144 back to its old name , @entity2			2
@entity80 is still considered a hero by many in @entity2 who credit him for transforming a fishing culture into a tourist nation			2
during his long rule , @entity11 was among his fiercest critics , alleging that @entity80 ruled with an iron fist , crushing dissent , amassing wealth and stacking his administration with friends and relatives			0
@entity11 was arrested as a journalist several times and held as a political prisoner			2
until his defeat by @entity11 , @entity80 won six previous elections as the only candidate on the ballot			0
he had sought a seventh five - year term , saying that he would need a few more years to see through the reforms he has put in place			0
@entity81 is also grappling with a very likely possibility that it will go under water if the current pace of climate change keeps raising sea levels			0
most of it lies just 4.9 feet ( 1.5 meters ) above sea the @entity178 ' @entity177 has forecast a rise in sea levels of at least 7.1 inches ( 18 cm ) by the end of the century			0
male is already protected by sea walls			0
but creating a similar barrier around the rest of the country will be cost - prohibitive			0
soon after his election , @entity11 raised the possibility of finding a new homeland for the country 's approximately 400,000 residents			1
he is the subject of an upcoming documentary , " @entity197 , " that tells the story of his efforts to raise awareness of climate change			0
