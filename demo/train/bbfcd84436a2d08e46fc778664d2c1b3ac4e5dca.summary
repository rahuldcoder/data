@entity0 -- if all goes according to plan for president @entity2 , his two - term presidency may end up being a case of " second verse , same as the first			1
" he won re-election last year by touting a first - term recovery from economic recession , as well as a major domestic achievement in health care reform and a major foreign policy triumph in taking out @entity14			1
now five months into his second term , the priorities and potentially achievable outcomes appear to be a similar trifecta			1
@entity2 is pushing hard domestically for an overhaul of the immigration system that would be similar to the health care reform bill in its scope and appeal to the @entity24 base			1
he also is increasing @entity26 aid , including military assistance , to @entity29 rebels trying to oust president @entity30 , an ally of @entity31 and @entity32			1
meanwhile , the economy continues to grow slowly but consistently , with the @entity34 signaling last week that it intended to end stimulus policies adopted in response to the recession inherited by @entity2 when he became president in 2009			1
the president has other objectives , including executive actions to reduce carbon emissions he plans to announce tuesday as part of a second - term push on climate change			1
a major push of his first term included a sharp reduction over time in auto emissions			2
his critics , especially conservative republicans , will continue opposing his priorities and attacking his administration for what they call overreach and excesses that they say demonstrate the perils of a big government philosophy			0
in a statement on monday , the @entity61 listed controversies from the @entity2 presidency -- the government - aided @entity66 solar panel firm that went bankrupt ; the @entity68 targeting of conservative groups seeking tax - exempt status ; and wasteful spending by the @entity68 and the @entity72 -- as examples of big government gone wild			1
" @entity2 may not like the big vs. small government debate , but his scandals are tied to a government that keeps growing , " the @entity61 statement said			2
dominating the @entity0 agenda this week is the immigration reform bill drafted by a bipartisan group of senators in an attempt to resolve a bitter debate over 11 million people living illegally in the country			1
the proposal offers a pathway to eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants while strengthening border , visa and employment controls in an attempt to bridge what for years has been a political chasm			2
however , divisions among congressional republicans remain the biggest threat to passage of the measure			0
conservatives oppose offering legal status to those living illegally in the country , calling such a move an amnesty for lawbreakers			0
they want tougher border security measures , and continually criticize the bipartisan @entity112 proposal as similar to what they call the too - broad and misguided health care reform law passed by @entity24 with no @entity117 support in 2010			1
however , moderate republicans want to avoid another electoral drubbing by @entity120 voters as occurred last year , when @entity2 won a huge majority of the nation 's largest minority demographic in defeating @entity117 nominee @entity124			1
they consider the bipartisan @entity112 proposal as their best chance to finally move past their party 's anti-immigrant stigma , while conservatives call such a move a trap for @entity117 because they believe most of the newly legal voters under the law would be @entity24			2
@entity26 @entity135 figures show the growing political voice of minorities in the @entity26 , particularly @entity120 -- the largest minority demographic at roughly 17 % of the population			0
almost half of the country 's children under age five are minorities , portending a near future in which non-whites outnumber whites			2
already , five states have a larger percentage of minorities than white residents			0
while the @entity24 - majority @entity112 is expected to pass the bipartisan immigration measure with support from a dozen or so @entity117 , the @entity117 - led @entity152 remains much more hostile to a broad immigration bill			2
opponents in the @entity152 want to slow the momentum built by a bipartisan compromise in the @entity112 announced last week that appeared to ensure support from a solid majority of senators			0
@entity152 conservatives call for breaking up the legislation into smaller pieces , rather than voting on a comprehensive proposal that includes both the border protection measures they want and the " legal status " provisions they oppose			0
" if you look through history , we do n't do big things very well in @entity0 , so i think it 's better to break it apart , do smaller pieces , have a heavy debate about it , " @entity117 rep. @entity171 of @entity172 told @entity173 on sunday			0
referring to the health care reform bill still despised by @entity117 three years after becoming law , @entity171 said " any time you rush anything through that big -- this was up to 1,100 pages -- i doubt that anybody 's really read it and been able to really get through piece of it			1
" house speaker @entity192 said last week he would refuse to introduce an immigration bill unless it had support from a majority of @entity117			0
however , it appeared that the only way the bipartisan @entity112 plan could pass the @entity152 would be if it received strong support from democrats bolstered by backing from a minority of @entity117			0
@entity24 sen. @entity202 of @entity203 , a member of the bipartisan " @entity204 " that drafted the immigration plan , warned that any attempt by @entity207 to stall or block the issue would bring a strong public backlash			0
" we have all kinds of allies who are usually conservative pushing for this bill -- the business community , the high - tech community , the evangelical community , the @entity222 bishops , the growers throughout the country , " @entity202 told @entity1 on sunday , adding : " i think they 're going to have to act whether they have a majority of @entity117 or not			0

president @entity2 seeks a similar second - term record as his first
immigration reform would be like health care reform of three years *ago*
ending @entity30 's rule in @entity29 would be this term 's @entity14 triumph
the economy continues its incremental recovery
