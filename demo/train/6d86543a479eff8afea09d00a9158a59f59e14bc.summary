@entity0 -- a controversial @entity3 surveillance unit that cataloged information on @entity6 communities never produced a lead that linked to a potential terrorist plot during years of investigating , according to the head of the city 's police intelligence division			1
the @entity3 's @entity12 -- or @entity13 -- was put together with the @entity15 's help following the september 11 , 2001 , attacks			1
the unit has acknowledged that it engaged in monitoring that included @entity6 - owned business and mosques across the @entity0 region			1
the unit 's reports , however , never led to a terrorism investigation in at least six years of surveillance , according to court testimony from @entity27 , the commanding officer of the police intelligence division			1
" i could tell you that i have never made a lead from rhetoric that came from a @entity12 report and i 'm here since 2006 , " he said in a june 28 deposition unsealed monday			2
" i do n't recall other ones prior to my arrival			0
again , that 's always a possibility			2
i am not aware of any			0
" a 60 - page report obtained by @entity40 earlier this year showed @entity3 maps of @entity42 , @entity43 , and photographs of @entity6 residences and mosques , while other reports revealed that authorities had tracked websites and on at least one occasion placed an undercover officer with university students			1
there was no statement in the documents regarding terrorism or criminal activity			0
@entity27 's june testimony was part of a lawsuit that actually began with a class - action case in 1971 and resulted in a historic settlement over a decade later known as the @entity64 agreement , or @entity64 guidelines			1
the settlement restricted police -- who were then accused of compiling dossiers on political activists and those perceived as radicals -- from investigating individuals whose activities were constitutionally protected			0
but civil rights attorneys last year filed papers in federal court challenging whether the use of undercover agents and informants within @entity6 communities constituted a breach of those guidelines			0
@entity3 deputy commissioner @entity82 said tuesday that the " premise that the demographic unit was used for wholesale spying on @entity6 , using undercover officers and informants to do so , was false , " and that neither " confidential informants nor undercover officers were assigned to the demographics unit			1
" @entity90 added that " the small unit , about 8 people , surveyed places a terrorist might go to use a foreign language internet cafe , get a job off the books , find a place to stay , etc. " however , police did uncover information that " led them to recommend that investigators take a closer look			2
" he pointed to an " @entity105 book store in @entity106 frequented by the @entity108 plotter " as well as a @entity110 location that was being separately investigated by the @entity3			2
police actions adhered to the @entity113 guidelines , @entity90 added , which were modified following the 2001 attacks to provide authorities greater leeway in investigating potential threats			0
in the first expansive official description of the city 's @entity12 , @entity27 testified in june that the @entity3 had collected information often based on ethnicity and language			1
" @entity124 speakers from that region ( @entity126 ) would be of concern , so that 's why it 's important to me , " he said			0
listening in on a conversation at a @entity133 cafe could also be useful , he added , allowing analysts to determine what part of @entity137 the cafe - goers were from			2
" that may be an indicator of possibility that that is a sympathizer to @entity141 because @entity137 is dominated by @entity141			0
" but " related to demographics ... " i can tell you that information that ( has ) come in has not commenced an investigation			0
" the purpose of the unit is to help " identify locations if we 're faced with a threat , " he noted , offering investigators a better starting point when confronted with a possible attack			0
" the police department needs to know where we should go and look for that particular terrorist , " he said			0
" a lot of information that the @entity13 captures helps us identify locations that we should look or not look for			0
" he noted that " the information in the demographics reports does have value " because it " contains a lot of bits and pieces of value , of intelligence value			0
" in may , @entity43 attorney general @entity171 announced that the @entity3 did not violate @entity43 laws when it carried out surveillance of @entity6 - run businesses across state lines			1
the findings were the product of a three - month review meant to address concerns expressed by @entity6 organizations , who later filed a lawsuit in @entity43 federal court against the @entity3 for unfairly targeting the @entity6 community			2
meanwhile , news of @entity27 's testimony drew statements from activists on tuesday , who called the police program " unconstitutional and inconsistent with our nation 's values			1
" " the @entity3 's spying on @entity6 based solely upon their faith violates the most basic @entity200 values of religious freedom and equal protection of the law , " said @entity194 , legal director of an activist group called @entity196			1
@entity200 attorney general @entity204 in march called reports of @entity3 surveillance " disturbing , " though @entity208 chief counterterrorism advisor @entity207 praised the city 's efforts to strike a balance between security and the protection of civil rights .			1

the @entity3 's @entity12 was put together with the @entity15 's help
the unit 's reports never led to a terrorism investigation in at least 6 years of monitoring
@entity27 's testimony was part of a suit that began with class - action case in 1971
