-- voters in military - run @entity3 head to the polls sunday for the first time in two decades			1
the @entity6 has denounced the vote -- the military junta will maintain a plurality of seats in the parliament while the remainder are contested by candidates from dozens of parties , including one formed by the military - backed former prime minister			2
@entity17 's chess match with @entity3 additionally , @entity19 's @entity18 , which won a landslide victory in 1990 but was not allowed to take power when the military nullified the vote , is boycotting the vote			1
it was disbanded by the junta earlier this year when its insistence on keeping @entity19 on its rolls barred it from registering for the election			1
@entity19 , a @entity29 laureate who has spent most of the last 20 years under house arrest or in prison , says she will not vote			1
here 's a preview of sunday 's vote			2
how many will vote ? there are about 29 million eligible voters and more than 40,000 voting stations in the country			0
the population is about 58 million			0
what are they voting for ? this is the first election since 1990 , when the @entity18 won a landslide -- a victory that was never acknowledged by the army			1
after years of stalling , now @entity3 's military regime is holding an election , which many analysts say is nothing more than a sham to legitimize its rule			1
voters will elect representatives to two houses of parliament ( instead of one as before ) and there will be 14 state / regional assemblies			0
the lower house , the @entity58 , will have 440 seats and the upper house , the @entity61 , will have 224			0
there are about 900 seats in the 14 state or regional assemblies			0
however , with 25 percent of the seats in each of these assemblies is reserved for the military , the seats up for grabs are reduced to 330 , 168 and 665 respectively			0
each voter will be casting a vote for each of these three assemblies			0
what about @entity19 ? the icon of the democracy movement remains under house arrest , her 15th year of detention			1
her latest detainment was imposed after @entity82 @entity81 swam the lake next to her house in may 2009 and spent two days in her compound , saying afterwards he was delivering a message from @entity88			0
can @entity19 run in the election ? conveniently for the junta , the election law specifies that a convict can not be a member of a political party , and so @entity19 can not stand for election			1
the @entity18 refused to expel her in exchange for being able to register as a party in the election , hence they are now boycotting the process			1
however , some of their members have split and formed a new party , @entity104 ( @entity104 ) , which will take part in the election			1
what will happen to @entity18 and its members ? it is now an illegal party since members did n't register it as a party			1
they have been unclear about their next move , saying they will have to become a " social movement			0
" which party does the junta favor ? the youth wing of the army , the @entity119 ( @entity120 ) , has transformed itself into the @entity123 ( @entity123 ) , a political party , which is expected to run uncontested in many areas			1
@entity125 exposed secrets but junta keeps power why did @entity129 , the prime minister , and some other ministers have to resign ? he has resigned to lead @entity123			0
its predecessor , the @entity120 , had at least 26 million members , and @entity123 has at least 16 million party members			2
what are the other main parties ? the @entity138 ( @entity138 ) is the party of the former military strong man @entity139			2
the @entity138 was beaten in the 1990 election by @entity19 's @entity18 , but the army ignored the result			1
some analysts speculate that a high vote for the @entity138 could be interpreted as a protest vote against the current regime			0
the @entity104 is a splinter group of former @entity18 members who think it 's better to participate in this election as a first step towards full democracy			1
a total of 37 parties are taking part in the election			2
what was the @entity158 and what happens to it ? the @entity158 was the official name of the junta			0
officially , it will disappear as the new government is formed , but critics say the same officers will remain in power and , crucially , senior gen. @entity167 is expected to remain commander in chief of the army			0
how much does it cost to participate ? each candidate has to pay a us $ 500 fee for running in the election -- and the fee has been criticized as an obstacle to many who would otherwise stand for election			2
so if it 's a sham , does that mean nothing will change ? some analysts say that although the vote is rigged , the paradigm is changing			0
with regional assemblies , ethnic groups may gain power and effect change on the ground			0
a president , not a general , will be head of state , and another set of elections will be held in five years , when perhaps democracy may have a better chance .			2

the election sunday is the first in @entity3 in 20 years
nobel peace laureate @entity19 can not run for office
her party , the @entity18 , has been disbanded
