all presidential decisions are , in the end , difficult and complex			1
and under any circumstance , the decisions on issues of war ( surgical strikes included ) are agonizing			1
the decision to use force -- the repercussions , the cost in blood and treasure , the geostrategic implications -- is complicated and the implications obviously immense			2
but as the @entity17 story unfolds , there is an almost @entity19 drama beneath the surface -- one of political careers made and broken , of past positions held and almost abandoned			1
not to mention the political enemies now finding themselves -- awkwardly -- on the same side of history			0
as the public debate plays out , the political past lingers , and haunts every moment			0
first consider the irony of @entity31 himself			1
it 's no surprise to anyone that this president is a reluctant warrior			2
his rise to national prominence was based , in part , on his antiwar sentiment on @entity40			0
in the past , he 's been a forceful proponent of the need for congressional authorization for the use of force			0
he tells the @entity46 people , at every opportunity , that he is extracting us from two wars			1
that was at the top of his to - do list , and he 's doing it			0
so now this , er , wrinkle in which @entity31 becomes the conscientious aggressor			1
he is the president who defends his @entity59 surveillance strategy and his frequent use of drones to an unhappy @entity63 base			2
he drew the red line on chemical weapons ( which he now explains was also the world 's red line )			0
he 's certain we need to hit @entity69 but seeks support from a @entity71 he generally disdains			0
like @entity74 's @entity73 in " through the @entity75 , " @entity31 could well be asking , " i know who i was when i got up this morning , but i think i must have been changed several times since then			1
as the president himself pointed out wednesday in @entity80 , " had i been in the @entity81 , i would have suggested @entity71 have the ability to weigh in			2
" it was hardly lost on him that it would seem , well , a tad hypocritical that someone who had spoken repeatedly about a congressional buy - in on the use of force was now willing to go it alone			2
so after the @entity91 said no , the president looked homeward for a coalition of the willing			0
and so , another irony : the president 's legacy now is in the hands of a notoriously paralyzed and partisan @entity71 -- a @entity71 that has n't exactly friended him			0
and that brings us to the agony part of this drama -- sen. @entity101			1
here 's the man who lost to @entity31 in 2008 and remains his foreign policy nemesis			1
@entity101 is the @entity105 's major ( and increasingly lonely ) hawk - in - residence			1
he thinks @entity31 made a huge mistake in not arming the @entity17 rebels and charges the president with dawdling for two years while this civil war intensified			1
oh , and by the way , he believes @entity31 's surgical strike is too little , too late			1
and yet , here he is , on the verge of supporting @entity31 — and taking on the libertarians in his own party			1
and not because he likes him , and not because he likes the policy — but because he believes that a congressional no - vote could be " catastrophic " for the nation			2
in the end , he may still balk because the mission , as defined by @entity71 , is too narrow			0
but he clearly wants to find a way to stand with the president			0
" @entity73 " would be right at home			0
" i ca n't go back to yesterday , " she understood			0
" because i was a different person then			0

@entity126 : decisions about *military* strikes are always agonizing and difficult
she says the @entity17 decision features a president who *famously* opposed a war
also in *spotlight* is @entity101 , who lost to @entity31 and *disapproves* of his foreign policy
@entity126 : @entity101 may wind up backing @entity31 on @entity17 to avoid catastrophic defeat for @entity46
