-- do you know how long your cell phone company keeps records of whom you text , who calls you or what places you have traveled ? do you know how often cell phone companies turn over this information to the police and whether they first ask the police to get a warrant based on probable cause ? no , you do n't			1
not unless you work for a cell phone company or a law enforcement agency with a specialty in electronic surveillance			1
you are n't alone : @entity18 and the courts have no idea either			0
the little we do know is worrisome			0
the companies are not legally required to turn over your information simply because a police officer is curious about you			2
yet wireless carriers sell this information to police all the time			1
as far as the cell phone companies are concerned , the less americans know about it the better			1
whom you text and call and where you go ( tracked by your cell phone as long as it 's on ) can reveal a great deal about you			2
your calling patterns can show which friends matter to you the most , and your travel patterns can reveal what political and religious meetings you attend and what doctors you visit			0
over time , this data accumulates into a dossier portraying details of your life so intimate that you may not have thought of them yourself			0
in comparison with companies such as @entity54 and @entity55 , which collect , store and use our information in one way or another , cell phone companies are less transparent			1
@entity62 rep. @entity61 , co-chairman of the @entity63 , recently requested that cell phone companies disclose basic statistics on how our personal data is shared with the government			1
let 's hope the companies are forthcoming -- but do n't hold your breath			0
to be sure , there can be legitimate reasons for law enforcement agents to track individuals ' movements			0
for example , when officers can demonstrate to a judge that they have a good reason to believe that tracking will turn up evidence of a crime			0
but with a surveillance technique this powerful , the public has a strong interest in understanding how it is used to ensure that it is not abused			1
while the details of individual investigations can legitimately be kept secret , the public and our elected representatives have a right to know the policies in general so their wisdom can be debated			0
cell phone companies have long concealed these facts , and they 're fighting vigorously to keep it that way			1
in @entity100 , the cell phone industry recently opposed a bill that would have required companies to tell their customers how often and under what circumstances they turn over location information to the police , complaining that it would be " unduly burdensome			1
" what little has come to light so far about the companies ' practices does not paint a comforting picture			0
addressing a surveillance industry conference in 2009 , @entity114 's electronic surveillance manager revealed that the company had received so many requests for location data that it set up a website where the police could conveniently access the information from the comfort of their desks			2
in just a 13 - month period , he said , the company had provided law enforcement with 8 million individual location data points			0
other than @entity114 , we do not have even this type of basic information about the frequency of requests for any of the other cell phone companies			1
the poorly understood relationship between cell phone companies and police raises grave privacy concerns			1
like the companies , law enforcement agencies have a strong incentive to keep what is actually happening a secret , lest the public find out and demand new legal protections			2
more than 10 years ago , the @entity146 convinced the @entity147 to abandon legislation that would have required law enforcement agencies to compile similar statistics , arguing that it would turn " crime fighters into bookkeepers			0
" the excessive secrecy has frustrated the ability of the @entity62 people to have an informed debate on just how much information police should have access to without judicial oversight or having to show probable cause			2
it has also prevented @entity18 and the courts from effectively addressing these intrusive surveillance powers			0
that is not how our system of government is supposed to work			0
it would not be difficult for the carriers to tell customers how their data is collected , stored and shared			1
in fact , an internal @entity146 document from 2010 , dislodged through a public records request by the @entity174 , showed the data retention policies of all major carriers on a single piece of paper			2
the phone companies have all created detailed handbooks for law enforcement agents describing their policies and prices charged for surveillance assistance , a few dated versions of which have seeped out onto the @entity188			2
if the cell phone companies can provide this information to law enforcement agencies , they can and should provide basic information about their sharing of data with law enforcement to their customers , too			1
while law enforcement sometimes argues that making members of the public aware that cell phone companies can track them will make it more difficult to catch criminals , it is too late in the day for that argument now that cell phone tracking is a staple of television police procedurals			1
why are n't these policies available on the companies ' websites ? with such information , consumers could vote with their wallets and punish those companies that do n't protect privacy			0
keeping their customers in the dark about surveillance is better for business , it seems			0
we pay the cell phone companies to provide us with a service , not keep tabs on us for the government			1
and yet the companies that now have access to some of our most private information refuse to reveal even the most basic facts about their policies ? we deserve better			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity232 .			0

a number of cell phone companies are selling users ' private information to police
@entity232 : wireless carriers have been secretive about their actions
she says the public needs to be informed so that this surveillance technique is not abused
@entity232 : wireless carriers should tell customers how data is collected , stored and shared
