@entity0 -- the big news in the @entity3 this week may be what did n't happen			0
there was not a single reported slaying , stabbing , shooting or knifing in any of the five boroughs on monday , according to the @entity8			2
" it is unusual in a city of 8 million people , but we never read that much into one day , " said deputy police commissioner @entity9 , who said it was the " first time in memory " that the city had had such a lull in violent crime			1
the violence - free stretch spanned 36 hours , starting sunday evening when a man was shot in the head and lasted until tuesday morning with another shooting , police said			1
for a city that once suffered from high crime rates , monday 's feat fits into a broader trend of dropping homicide rates , police say			1

in 1990 , police say the city tallied just under 2,300 homicides			2
by 2002 , that number had dropped below 600			0
so far in 2012 , police say that number is 366			0
" if you think back to how bad things were in the 1970s and ' 80s , you were lucky if you had a few hours go by where you did n't have a violent crime , nevermind a whole day , " said @entity8 historian @entity38			1
nationwide , there were 14,612 murders in 2011 , on average one every 36 minutes , the @entity43 reported			1
that 's a small decline from 14,722 in 2010			0
in october , the @entity43 said violent crime across the nation fell for the fifth consecutive year in 2011 with murder , rape and robbery all declining , but it noted that violent crime remains a serious problem in many urban areas			1
the @entity43 crime statistics differed from a telephone crime survey released in october by the @entity57			2
