@entity12 was the getaway driver , the superintendent said			2
@entity2 said @entity11 was sentenced to two years ' probation in january 2012 for unlawful use of a firearm			2
" this has to stop			2
gun offenders have to do significant jail time , " @entity2 said			2
" criminals have to be held accountable			2
and there has to be a certainty of punishment when we arrest somebody with an illegal firearm			2
" the charges come 12 days after @entity24 was shot to death at a park in what her godfather , @entity60 , described as an " ideal community " on @entity0 's @entity63			1
police said that there were no substantive tips as to the shooter 's identity , but once they had a description of the car , they linked it to a traffic stop that occurred several days before the killing			1
that description and interviews with parolees led them to @entity11 and @entity12			2
@entity2 said @entity11 surrendered on saturday night without a struggle , but @entity12 tried to escape			0
no weapon was recovered , he said			1
@entity24 's was killed a week after she performed at one of the events surrounding @entity81 's second inauguration			1
@entity82 , one of @entity24 's cousins , said the family was elated that the suspects were in jail			1
" however there is no level of comfort -- not long - term comfort -- and we are still miserable , " she told @entity1 's @entity87			0
" ( @entity24 ) is the face of every parent 's dream child			0
@entity24 had so many different things awaiting her in life			0

my little cousin really was an angel			0
" she said @entity24 was hanging out with a volleyball team -- a group of girls and one boy -- when she was killed			0

" @entity24 's parents are in @entity126 to attend the @entity128 address , @entity2 said			1
@entity24 , who often urged friends to stay away from gangs , was an honor student and band majorette at @entity132			0

more than 500 people were fatally shot in 2012			1
@entity2 reiterated his call for minimum sentences for gun crimes and mandatory background checks			0
" @entity11 would not have been on the street of @entity145 to commit this act , " the impassioned superintendent said			0
" this is not about gun control			0
this is about the criminal justice system being designed to prevent gun violence			0
" huge gaps in that system must be closed , he said , mentioning sentencing guidelines and universal background checks for gun buyers			0
" but in my book , one of the bigger things is ( a ) requirement to report the loss , theft or transfer of firearms , " he said			1

" i get a little emotional , " he said			0
