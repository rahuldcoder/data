@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity3 said tuesday it has worked out a way for groups of @entity6 who are dissatisfied with their faith to join the @entity9			1
the @entity3 says more anglicans have expressed an interest in joining the @entity9			1
the process will enable groups of @entity6 to become @entity9 and recognize the pope as their leader , yet have parishes that retain @entity19 rites , @entity13 officials said			1
the move comes some 450 years after @entity21 broke from @entity0 and created the @entity19 , forerunner of the @entity22			0
the parishes would be led by former @entity19 clergy -- including those who are married -- who would be ordained as @entity9 priests , said the rev. @entity27 , ecumenical director of the @entity28			1
" this sets up a process for whole groups of @entity6 -- clergy and laity -- to enter in to the @entity9 while retaining their forms of worship and other @entity19 traditions , " @entity27 said			1
the number of @entity6 wishing to join the @entity9 has increased in recent years as the @entity22 has welcomed the ordination of women and openly gay clergy and blessed homosexual partnerships , said cardinal @entity42 , the head of the @entity3 's @entity44			1
their talks with the @entity3 recently began speeding up , @entity3 officials said , leading to tuesday 's announcement			2
" the @entity9 is responding to the many requests that have been submitted to the @entity3 from groups of @entity19 clergy and faithful in different parts of the world who wish to enter into full visible communion , " @entity42 said			1
@entity42 said " hundreds " of @entity6 around the world have expressed their desire to join the @entity9			1
among them are 50 @entity19 bishops , said archbishop @entity61 of the @entity62			0
while married @entity19 priests may be ordained as @entity9 priests , the same does not apply to married @entity19 bishops , @entity42 said			1
" we 've been praying for this unity for 40 years and we 've not anticipated it happening now , " @entity61 said			0
" @entity68 is at work here			0
" one interested group is the @entity71 , an association of churches that is separate from the @entity22 and has hundreds of thousands of members worldwide			0
the tac in 2007 petitioned the @entity3 for unity with the @entity9 with the stipulation that the group retain its @entity19 rites			1
the @entity71 's primate , archbishop @entity78 of @entity79 , said in a statement tuesday that the @entity3 's announcement " more than matches the dreams we dared to include in our petition two years ago			2
" that is because the @entity3 's move involves not only the @entity71 but other @entity19 groups that want to unite with the @entity9 , said the right rev. @entity88 , bishop ordinary of the western diocese of the @entity22 of @entity90 , which is part of the @entity71			1
the @entity3 has yet to release all details of the offer , and the @entity71 's leaders will meet and discuss how to respond when it does , @entity88 said			2
but @entity88 said he believes much of @entity71 will respond favorably			0
@entity88 , who also is rector of @entity95 in @entity96 , @entity97 , said his parishioners have generally been " very warmly receiving " tuesday 's announcement			0
" it is encouraging for them to know their worship experience would n't be turned upside down by the @entity9 , " @entity88 said			2
" the person in the pew should see very little difference in the way we pray			0
we might be asked to pray aloud for any pope who happens to be in office , in addition to praying for our primate			0
" really , there 'd be very little other difference			0
" the parishes retaining the @entity19 rites would answer not to @entity9 bishops but to regional or nationwide " personal ordinariates " who would report to the pope , @entity27 said			1
those officials often will be former @entity19 clergy , @entity3 officials said			2
the @entity19 said the move ends a " period of uncertainty " for @entity19 groups who wanted more unity with the @entity9			2
both groups have a " substantial overlap in faith , doctrine and spirituality " and will continue to hold official dialogues , the archbishops of @entity131 and @entity132 said in a joint statement			0
" those @entity6 who have approached the @entity3 have made clear their desire for full , visible unity in the one , holy , catholic and apostolic church , " @entity42 said			1
" at the same time , they have told us of the importance of their @entity19 traditions of spirituality and worship for their faith journey			0
" preserving @entity19 traditions , such as mass rites , adds to the diversity of the @entity9 , he said			1
" the unity of the church does not require a uniformity that ignores cultural diversity , as the history of @entity158 shows , " he said			0
" moreover , the many diverse traditions present in the @entity9 today are all rooted in the principle articulated by @entity161 in his letter to the @entity164 : ' there is one lord , one faith , one baptism			2
' " @entity2 's @entity169 and @entity170 contributed to this report .			0
