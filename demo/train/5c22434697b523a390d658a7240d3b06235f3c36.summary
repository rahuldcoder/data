a newly revealed claim of conspiracy in the death of princess @entity4 has royal watchers buzzing once again , nearly 16 years after the woman who would now be a royal grandmother died in a @entity7 car crash			1
but @entity9 police seem to be knocking down the claim -- that the @entity9 military was involved in the deaths of @entity4 , her boyfriend and their driver in august 1997			1
" this is not a re-investigation , " @entity15 tersely stressed , in a statement that revealed none of what it had been told			0
the latest claim appears to have been sent first to military authorities and then to @entity24 police by the parents - in - law of a @entity9 special forces sniper after his marriage had fallen apart , according to an article on the website of the @entity32 newspaper			1
it did not offer a source for its reporting			0
sunday people said it had seen a seven - page handwritten letter by the in - laws alleging that the soldier , whom the newspaper did not name , had boasted to his wife that the elite @entity43 commando unit was behind the deaths			2
the @entity9 @entity45 told @entity46 only that " this is for @entity15 to investigate			2
" military authorities have been aware of the claim since the 2011 court - martial of the soldier 's former roommate on weapons charges , @entity32 reported			1
the unnamed soldier mentioned in the letter was a witness in that case , according to the newspaper			2
neither the @entity32 piece nor an earlier version carried by @entity59 offered details of the claimed involvement by soldiers in the deaths			0
@entity4 , 36 , and @entity64 , her 42 - year - old boyfriend , died when the @entity65 they were traveling in hit a pillar in the @entity69 tunnel in @entity7 in august 1997			2
they were being followed at the time by the paparazzi after leaving the @entity73			0
their driver , @entity74 , was also killed			0
investigators concluded that @entity74 was drunk and driving at high speed			0

dress princess @entity4 wore to dance with @entity78 auctioned the princess left behind her two children , prince @entity80 , whose wife recently gave birth to @entity4 's first grandchild , and prince @entity84			1
some 2.5 billion people around the world watched @entity4 's funeral			1
a @entity9 coroner 's inquest in 2007 concluded that the deaths were the result of " grossly negligent driving of the following vehicles and of the @entity65			2
" the inquest found no evidence of murder			0
a @entity24 police spokesman said no new information had been examined since this inquest			1
yet the deaths have always been paired with conspiracy theories accusing @entity9 and @entity104 intelligence services and members of @entity9 royalty of orchestrating @entity4 's death			1
the @entity108 reported in 2003 that the @entity4 wrote to her former butler @entity109 10 months before she died , saying her life was at its " most dangerous " phase and warning of a plot to tamper with the brakes of her car			2
after their deaths , @entity117 , @entity64 's father , said the couple were planning to announce their engagement and publicly accused prince @entity123 , @entity4 's former father - in - law , of orchestrating the couple 's murders			1
he testified at the 2007 inquest			0
a spokesman for @entity117 said sunday he had no comment at this time but trusts the police will do a thorough investigation			0
@entity4 remains wildly popular in death , and news of the new claim sparked an immediate surge in discussion of her death on news sites and social media			1
" is it just me or does it ( seem ) like a princess diana conspiracy hits around this time of year , every year ? , " @entity144 user @entity142 posted			0
the rumors come to light weeks before the 16th anniversary of @entity4 's death , and a little more than a month before the @entity9 premier of " @entity4 , " a new movie about the former princess 's life			1
it 's unclear whether these allegations will make it any further than previous claims have			0
@entity24 police seem unlikely to make any big announcements , based on the closing line of their statement			1
" not prepared to discuss further , " @entity163 said in the statement			0
