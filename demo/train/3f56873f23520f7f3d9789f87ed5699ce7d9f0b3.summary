the " @entity10 " -- or , as they 're more formally known , the leaders of the @entity1 , @entity2 and @entity3 -- announced an agreement wednesday to work on a plan to streamline trade and travel , including border controls among the countries			1
@entity1 president @entity11 , @entity2 prime minister @entity12 and @entity3 president @entity13 agreed to streamline border controls to facilitate the movement of people through the establishment of a trusted traveler program			1
they also spent a great deal of time during the @entity23 discussing efforts to broker a new trade agreement with @entity27 nations , they said in a joint news conference after the summit in @entity30 , @entity3			1
@entity11 has called for " fast - track " trade authority from @entity32 for him to pursue the so - called @entity33 , a massive free - trade zone			1
but members of his own party , including @entity38 minority leader @entity37 and @entity40 majority leader @entity39 , have voiced firm opposition to such authority			2
republicans seized on vice president @entity44 's reported comments at last week 's @entity38 @entity47 retreat in @entity48			2
there , he was heard conceding the trade issue was quickly becoming a source of frustration within the party , especially among labor groups that are key to midterms next fall			1
" the jobs they seem to care about most are democrats in @entity32 -- not families across the country eager to join the ranks of the employed , " senate minority leader @entity56 said in a statement			0
senior obama administration officials played down reports about @entity44 's comments as coming from " second - hand accounts			0
" but , they added , the @entity38 remains firmly committed to its trade agenda			0
" it would not be in the interest of the @entity1 to put this on the back burner , " one official said			0
@entity38 spokesman @entity74 insists that differences among @entity47 over trade issues date back several administrations			0
" the differing opinions on these matters are not new , and the fact that there are differing opinions within both parties is not new , " @entity74 said tuesday			0
another area of friendly disagreement for the " @entity10 " is over the @entity11 administration 's handling of the @entity88			1
@entity2 officials have grown impatient with the lengthy approval process in the @entity1 for the contested project , which would transport oil from @entity93 to the @entity94			0
while a recent @entity97 environmental impact study appeared to brighten prospects for approval , senior administration officials indicated @entity12 is not likely to receive the news many in his nation want to hear during the summit			0
" i think what president @entity11 will do is explain to him where we are in the review of the @entity88 pipeline , and indicate that we 'll , of course , let our @entity2 friends know when we 've arrived at a decision , " a senior administration official said			1
the @entity88 project has also divided @entity47 , namely environmentalists who see the pipeline as a symbolic battle in the larger fight over efforts to deal with climate change			1
while in @entity3 , @entity11 faced another delicate balancing act over the issue of immigration reform			2
the plight of undocumented immigrants in the @entity1 , notably the substantial number of migrants who crossed the border from @entity3 , is a major political issue south of the @entity128			1
latino special interest groups , a core @entity47 constituency , have criticized the administration for its aggressive deportation policy as it struggles to find a long - term solution to the immigration issue			2
senior administration officials told reporters last week that @entity11 remains committed to comprehensive immigration reform that includes a pathway to citizenship for undocumented workers			0
but that legislative priority has hit a roadblock in @entity32 , where @entity144 leaders have indicated there is little hope for a breakthrough this year before the midterms			2
" with respect to immigration , i think president @entity13 has a very good understanding , frankly , of the state of play in the @entity1 , " a senior administration official said .			0

three nations will streamline border controls
