-- speaking is profoundly human : more of the human brain is devoted to speech than any other activity			1
people can have an iq of 50 , or a brain that is only one - third the normal size and have difficulties with many simple tasks , but they can speak			1
humans are so tuned to words that from about the age of 18 months , children learn about eight to 10 new words a day , a rate that continues until adolescence			0
humans love to speak : when two hearing people encounter each other , they will speak , despite having other means of communication such as gesturing or drawing			2
even when people speak different languages or come from different cultures , they will try to find common words and phrases			0
one - day - old infants can distinguish speech from any other sounds and 4 - day - olds can distinguish between their native language and other languages			2
even in the womb , a fetus can distinguish her or his mother 's voice from all other female voices			0
adults can distinguish speech sounds at twice the rate of any other sounds , aided by special hair cells in the outer right ear			2

even human ancestors such as the @entity58 could not possibly speak : speech is a new and remarkably impressive ability			2
so , there is nothing so human as speech -- at least until modern technologies came along			2
through striking advances in a computer 's ability to understand and produce speech , it is common to use your telephone to make airline reservations , answer questions and search the @entity74			2
because of the shrinking size and increasing speed of computers , it is also possible to speak directly to your automobile			0
from putting up with the car intoning , " your door is ajar , " we have moved to navigation systems that can tell you where to find a latte and car interfaces that understand spoken commands and even allow drivers to dictate e-mails , texts and make phone calls			2
what could be more simple and natural than talking , even to a technology ? and speaking to cars seems particularly desirable			1
we do n't have to take our eyes from the road or our hands from the wheel to select buttons or make choices : why not let our mouths and our ears do all the work ? unfortunately , it 's not so simple or so desirable			1
recent research by the @entity107 , conducted by @entity108 at the @entity109 , finds that the new technology can be so distracting it impairs the ability to drive			1
studies found that while driving , our attention becomes overloaded by speaking			0
it basically takes our minds , if not our eyes , off the road			1
here are three reasons why talking while driving is so distracting , and not as safe and effective as you might think : people like to picture who they are talking with			1
when you speak with someone face - to - face , you " hear lips and see voices " : your brain automatically and easily focuses on the person			0
when you speak on the telephone , you use brainpower to create a mental image of the person you are talking with : the less you know the person , the more mental workload it takes			0
when you talk to a car , use a phone in a car or dictate a text message , your brain has to do a great deal of work to picture with whom you are communicating			1
when you 're thinking that hard , it 's very difficult to pay attention to the road			0
that 's why talking on a cell phone -- hands free or not -- is much more dangerous than talking to a passenger			1
the need to imagine steals from attention to the road			0
see also : is hands - free driving just as dangerous ? people want to be understood			1
although people love to speak , there are few more frustrating things than someone not listening			0
listeners puts a great deal of energy into showing that they are listening : they nod their head , say " uh huh , " open their eyes and change their posture			0
people are built to expect these signals of attention , but cars refuse to provide them			0
as a result , drivers become overly concerned with whether the car understands or is even listening , and their attention is again drawn away from the road			1
in addition , the voice of the car does not have the rich vocal cues that indicate engagement and emotion , providing further evidence that the car is n't understanding			1
cars are not native speakers			0
when you encounter someone who is n't facile in your language , you have to put a great deal of time into selecting the right words , avoiding idioms and speaking slowly and clearly			0
speech is no longer an easy and natural means of communication in these instances			1
while it is remarkable that cars can understand something that took billions of years of human evolution , the typical car recognition rate of 85 % to 95 % makes it a mediocre second - language speaker			0
as a result , speech becomes effortful and demanding , stealing attention from the road			1
because of these problems , my laboratory and laboratories around the world are trying to find ways to support the driver in creating mental images , in showing that the car wants to understand and enabling the car to understand at levels equal to or even better than a person			0
and soon cars will be driving themselves , so that people can ignore the road and multitask their way to fighting for attention from each other , just as they do outside the car			1
watch : the self - driving car changes everything the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity227 .			1

@entity227 : more of our brain is devoted to speech than anything else ; we love to talk
@entity234 : talking to technology in your car is not natural and it *confuses* your brain
he says even with hands on wheel and eyes on road , talking to your car impairs driving
@entity234 : your brain works to fill in the *blanks* talking to an entity you ca n't see and does n't listen
