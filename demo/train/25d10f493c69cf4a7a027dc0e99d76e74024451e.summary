@entity0 -- @entity3 , the @entity5 codebreaker found dead inside an externally locked bag in his apartment in 2010 , was probably not killed as previously believed , @entity0 's @entity2 said wednesday , citing a lack of evidence otherwise			1
taking a different position from a coroner 's report last year that said it was likely someone killed @entity3 , @entity0 's @entity2 said its three - year investigation suggested that @entity3 most likely locked himself inside the large bag			1

but the @entity2 said that despite its investigation , there remained insufficient evidence to be definitive on how @entity3 died			1
" there are holes in what we understand about the circumstances of @entity3 ' death , " @entity19 said , admitting that some of the evidence is " odd			1
" this includes the lack of @entity3 ' dna on the padlock used to lock the large red bag his body was found in and the lack of hand prints on the edge of the bath where it was found , he said			1
" what we are left with is either individual pieces of evidence , or a lack of such evidence , that can logically support one of a number of hypotheses , " @entity19 said			0
the case has gripped the @entity56 public since @entity3 , known for his mathematical genius and code - breaking talent , was found dead at age 31 in august 2010			1
among the theories aired by @entity56 media were that @entity3 might have died at the hands of foreign intelligence agents or as a result of a kinky sexual encounter gone wrong			0
added to that speculation was the discovery of women 's clothes , wigs and cosmetics in @entity3 ' apartment			1
at the inquest into his death last year , coroner @entity73 shot down that speculation , saying she thought @entity3 bought them out of an interest in fashion , rather than any sexual motivation			1

video of two experts trying to recreate the scene was showing to the court			0
one had tried 300 times without success , but neither ruled out definitively the possibility @entity3 could have somehow done it alone			0
" it is now proven that it is theoretically possible for a person to lock themselves in that exact holdall , with the same type of lock , and in the configuration in which @entity3 was found			2
it is important to note that this fact was found to be a possibility by the inquest , " @entity19 said			0
meanwhile , family members suggested @entity3 had been murdered by killers versed in the " dark arts " of espionage			0
referring to speculation that @entity3 ' flat might have been forensically cleaned by unknown people responsible for his death , @entity19 said wednesday that a deep - clean would have removed all traces of @entity3 ' dna as well that of visitors to his flat			2
he said 10 to 15 traces of @entity119 had been found that were too insignificant to use to build a full profile and said advances in forensic science could " present opportunities for progress			0
" for the time being , however , there are " no active lines of enquiry that it is proportionate to pursue			0
" @entity3 ' family expressed their regret that mystery still surrounds his death but said they agree with the coroner 's verdict " on the basis of the facts at present known			1
" " we are naturally disappointed that it is still not possible to state with certainty how @entity3 died and the fact that the circumstances of his death are still unknown adds to our grief , " they said in a written statement			2
the family reiterated their disappointment that @entity3 ' employers at @entity5 had not checked on his welfare when he failed to attend work on august 16 , 2010			1
@entity3 was finally reported missing by a co-worker on august 23 , more than a week after the normally punctilious employee had last shown up at work			0
" we believe that if proper steps had been taken in the same manner as any reasonable employer would have undertaken , further information relating to the cause of his death might have become apparent and not have been lost due to the length of time before @entity3 's body was found , " they said			1
the family also noted that the @entity2 's investigators " were at last able to interview directly members of ( @entity56 intelligence agencies ) @entity169 and @entity5			2
" addressing media , @entity19 disputed a suggestion that police had been " blindsided " in their investigation by intelligence agencies but acknowledged that their method of interaction had improved during the investigation			0
" we did n't get it right at the beginning , " he said			0
initially , he said , the only @entity2 officers to deal with the intelligence agencies were those in @entity182 -- or counterterrorism command			0
the @entity182 officers had assessed @entity3 ' vetting and personnel files and found nothing relevant to the case			2
after the inquest , the senior investigating officer in the case personally requested and was granted access to the files and came to the same conclusion , @entity19 said			0
" the investigation into @entity3 's death will remain under review , and any new significant information or evidence will be robustly investigated , " he said			1
" if it is possible for us to give his family more answers we will do so			0

@entity5 codebreaker @entity3 ' body was found locked in a bag in his apartment in 2010
