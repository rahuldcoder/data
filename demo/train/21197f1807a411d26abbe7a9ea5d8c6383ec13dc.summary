-- the @entity3 and @entity4 administrations ' extraordinary program of targeted killing has resulted in the deaths of as many as 4,400 people to date			1
books such as @entity10 's " @entity9 " and @entity11 's " confront and conceal " are appearing thick and fast , focusing on the program and particularly on the use of drones to carry it out			0
the belated scrutiny is welcome			0
yet it still fails to critically assess the essential question : is this killing occurring in war ? both presidents @entity3 and @entity4 have attempted to justify thousands of drone attacks as part of a " war " or " armed conflict			1
" but is that correct ? the question must be answered in terms of international law			1
when the @entity29 kills people in foreign , sovereign states , the world looks to international law for the standard of justification			1
in war , enemy fighters may be killed under a standard of reasonable necessity ; outside war , authorities are far more restricted in their right to resort to lethal force			2
independent scholars confirm that many drone attacks are occurring outside war zones			1
these experts know the legal definition of war , and they understand why it is important to know it : above all , protecting human rights is different in war than from protecting them in peace			2
news : @entity56 spy agency chief to tell @entity57 : end drone strikes ; @entity60 targets for us to attack admittedly , this dual standard for justifiable killing makes the law protecting the right to life more complicated than the law protecting other fundamental rights			1
torture , for example , is absolutely prohibited in international law at all times , in war and peace			1
the law on killing is different			2
the human right to life codified in the @entity78 , to which the @entity29 is a party , prohibits the " arbitrary " deprivation of life			1
it does not prohibit absolutely all taking of life			0
the military may use lethal force against enemy fighters during an armed conflict if the use of force meets the requirements of military necessity , and if it will not have a disproportionate impact on civilian lives and property			0
countries may lawfully initiate armed conflict in self - defense if the state is the victim of a significant armed attack , as long as the self - defense is carried out against the state responsible for the armed attack			0
president @entity3 declared a " global war on terror " after 9/11 to , presumably , gain the advantage of more relaxed rules on killing and detention			2
some of the same lawyers who tried to develop legal cover for the use of torture produced an even flimsier analysis of why the entire world was a war zone , so that the president could authorize killing and detention of individuals worldwide			2
lawyers in both the @entity3 and @entity4 administrations have reportedly prepared memos that according to the media assert the @entity57 may lawfully conduct so - called " targeted killings " of the " war on terror " without violating president @entity123 's ban on assassination			2
@entity127 seems to turn in this analysis on the president personally approving a " kill list			0
" in november 2002 , the first killings occurred under this " global war " assertion			2
six people , including a 23 - year - old @entity29 , were killed by hellfire missiles in @entity136 fired from @entity57 - operated drones based in @entity138			1
the @entity140 special rapporteur for extra-judicial killing condemned the attack as an arbitrary deprivation of the right to life , but it would take over six years and a change of party in the @entity148 before human rights advocates , international law scholars , moral philosophers , theologians , and others would begin to focus on targeted killing as they had focused on the use of torture			1
why has it taken so long to focus on so many questionable deaths ? as already indicated , the law is more complicated on killing than on torture			2
to make the legal argument against targeted killing requires sophisticated knowledge of a broader range of international law than is involved in defending a human right such as the right to be free from torture			1
also , the @entity3 administration carried out fewer targeted killings : of the 336 attacks as of july 2012 in @entity56 , 284 have occurred under @entity4			2
@entity3 officials were better able , therefore , to suppress discussion			0
also , human rights advocates had their hands full with the more visible problems of the @entity3 era : torture , @entity179 and military commissions			0
a number of them then joined the @entity4 administration ; rather than condemn targeted killing as the violation of international law that it is , some former critics are defending it , presumably as part of their job			1
opinion : civilian casualties plummet in drone strikes the job of the @entity194 is to report on international law in a scholarly and objective fashion			1
the @entity194 has had a committee on the @entity199 for decades			0
from 2005 to 2010 , when i was its chair , the 18 - member committee , including members from five continents , undertook to produce a report on how " war " is legally defined			0
that report assesses hundreds of violent incidents over a period of 65 years			0
it concludes that under international law , war or armed conflict exists only when there is intense inter-group fighting by organized armed groups			1
these are objectively verifiable criteria that can not be fabricated by politicians			0
the @entity220 recently invoked them with respect to the violence in @entity224			0
the situation in @entity224 became a civil " war " when organized armed groups were fighting with intensity of some duration			0
targeted killing with drones in @entity136 , @entity230 , and @entity56 have generally violated the right to life because the @entity29 is rarely part of any armed conflict in those places			1
the human right to life that applies is the right that applies in peace			0
complete coverage of drones on @entity0 's @entity242 blog today , the @entity29 is engaged in armed conflict only in @entity244			0
to lawfully resort to military force elsewhere requires that the country where the @entity29 is attacking has first attacked the @entity29 ( such as @entity244 in 2001 ) , the @entity245 has authorized the resort to force ( @entity249 in 2011 ) or a government in effective control credibly requests assistance in a civil war ( @entity244 since 2002 )			1
if the president has been advised otherwise with regard to his " kill list , " he should read " @entity258 ? " join us on @entity261 / @entity260 the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity264 .			0

@entity264 : @entity29 drone strikes have killed as many as 4,400 people since 2002
many drone attacks are occurring outside war zones , says @entity264
those attacks have generally violated the right to life , she says
