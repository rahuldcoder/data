-- as @entity3 's switchover from nuclear power to renewable energy gathers pace , concerns are mounting over the cost to the country 's prosperity and its already squeezed consumers			1
politicians in @entity13 's largest economy want renewable power to contribute 35 % of the country 's electricity consumption by 2020 and 80 % by 2050 as part of its clean energy drive			1
the country 's " energiewende " -- translated as energy transformation -- is part of the government 's plan to move away from nuclear power and fossil fuels to renewable energy sources , following @entity28 's @entity27 disaster in 2011			1
@entity32 , vice-president of the @entity33 , told @entity0 that the government 's energy targets are " completely unfeasible			2
" " of course , it 's possible to erect tens of thousands of windmills but only at an extreme cost and waste of natural space , " he said			0
" and still it would not be able to deliver electricity when it is needed			0
" the government is investing heavily in onshore and offshore wind farms and solar technology in an effort to reduce 40 % of greenhouse gas emissions by 2020			1
last year chancellor @entity48 , who this week won her third term as @entity3 's leader , proposed to construct offshore wind farms in the @entity52 , a plan that would cost 200 billion euros ( $ 270 billion ) , according to the @entity55 economic institute in @entity56			1
as part of the energy drive , @entity48 also pledged to permanently shut down the country 's 17 nuclear reactors , which fuel 18 % of the country 's power needs			1
under @entity3 's @entity64 , the last nuclear power plant will be disconnected by 2022			1
@entity32 told @entity0 the rapid transition to renewables is economically " insane , " arguing that wind farms will cost at least 13 times more than traditional coal plants			2
he added : " offshore wind is somewhat better in performance , cost and usability but still you have to spend six times as much as what you have to spend for a conventional power plant			2
" paying the cost of renewable energy germans are already facing some of the highest energy bills in @entity13			0
according to the @entity83 , this year @entity82 electricity rates will increase by over 10 % due to a surcharge for using more renewable energy and a further 30 to 50 % price increase is expected in the next ten years			1
blackouts are another problem facing @entity3 's energy industry			0
with the bulk of wind turbines located in the east of the country , regional electricity grids face the threat of overloading , while the reliability of regular wind and solar power in northern @entity13 is also a concern			1
@entity101 , professor of energy economics at the @entity55 , told @entity104 's continued use of coal and fossil fuels to power its industrial hubs is making investors nervous			2
she said : " politicians give the wrong signals			0
they say ' well , on the one hand , we would like to have the energy transition , on the other hand ... ' what they do or what they propose is the opposite			0
" but @entity101 added that @entity3 is not in danger of an energy crisis and that a boom in renewables will have long term economic advantages			0
she said : " @entity52 ( @entity127 ) wind farms can provide 25 % of electricity production			1
onshore wind could produce a higher share			0
offshore wind energy is important for @entity3 as already a lot of jobs have been created			0
" @entity3 is one of six @entity13 countries to invest in wind farms including the @entity137 , @entity138 , @entity139 , the @entity140 and @entity141			2
and @entity142 , head of regulatory affairs at the @entity144 , told @entity0 the sooner the continent moves away from " dirty fuels , " such as coal , the better			0
he said : " the costs of offshore are ahead of us , that is true ... but the quicker everyone goes offshore the quicker the economies of scale and the costs come down			0
