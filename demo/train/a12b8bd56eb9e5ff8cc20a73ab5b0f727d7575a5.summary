nearly three years after it began , the surge of @entity2 troops to @entity3 is over			1
in december 2009 , on president @entity6 's order , an additional 30,000 troops headed to the war - torn country hoping to stabilize it and quash what was then widely viewed as a @entity12 resurgence despite just more than eight years of war			1
now , the last several hundred of the extra troops have left @entity3 , according to a senior @entity2 defense official			1
payoff ? assessing the @entity3 surge that still leaves about 68,000 @entity2 troops still in the nation , as was the case in late 2008			1
and violence continues to rage in parts of @entity3 , including numerous high - profile " green - on - blue " attacks of late in which men dressed in @entity3 police and military uniforms open fire on other @entity3 security officers and coalition forces			1
if all goes to plan , the withdrawal of @entity2 troops will continue as more security responsibilities are handed over to @entity3 authorities			1
@entity37 leaders this may signed off on @entity6 's exit strategy that calls for an end to combat operations next year and the withdrawal of the @entity2 - led international military force by the end of 2014			1
after that , a new and different @entity37 mission will advise , train and assist an expected 350,000 - strong @entity3 force , @entity37 secretary general @entity44 has said			2
@entity6 committed to the surge following years in which the @entity2 government poured troops and resources into the war in @entity54 , giving the @entity12 time to rebuild and start retaking their traditional stronghold in southern @entity3			1
at the time , progress toward having @entity3 forces prepared to take over security in their country had seemingly stalled			2
earlier this month , the deputy commander of international forces in @entity3 said @entity37 - led forces had made progress			0
yet lt. gen. @entity66 also noted the continued efforts by insurgents to " divide the coalition from our @entity3 partners			2
" one example of how the insurgency can strike , seemingly at will and around the country , is last week 's brazen assault on a coalition base in southern @entity3 that killed two @entity2 troops and destroyed six coalition fighter jets , as well as a suicide attack in @entity78 on tuesday that killed 12 people			1
violence rages as surge troops depart @entity3 the senior combat leader in @entity3 , gen. @entity83 , said last month that insurgent violence in southern @entity3 was down 3 % over 2011 levels , but admitted it was not " statistically significant			2
" however , while violence levels may not have changed much , @entity83 said the significant change was where the violence had moved			0
" we have pushed hard on the insurgency to push them out of the population centers , much of which was cleared last year , and we 've continued to push them into an increasingly smaller series of areas , districts , where we have , in many respects , contained them , " said @entity83 , head of @entity37 's @entity90			0
@entity102 , a senior fellow at the @entity104 - based analyst organization @entity103 , positively pointed to signs that " the insurgency is not the monolithic structure it was back in 2009 , when people said they were at the gates of @entity78			0
" @entity37 restricts @entity3 operations after ' green - on - blue ' killings , anti-islam film yet @entity102 , a former @entity37 adviser to gen. @entity112 when the now @entity114 director was the top commander in @entity3 , also added flatly , " we have not seen as much success as we had hoped for			0
" " did the surge provide the necessary impetus in terms of security and the support of government and other activities so the @entity12 and the insurgency would be brought to the table ? i do n't think that has happened as quickly as people had originally hoped , " said @entity102			0
the effort to train @entity3 forces is n't over , even as the coalition troop withdrawal continues			2
marine gen. @entity130 , head of allied forces in southern @entity3 , said last april that he 'd seen improvement in @entity3 security forces			0
still , he added more work needs to be done in intelligence , combat medicine , special operations , artillery and criminal investigation			0
" as the conventional forces leave , special operations forces will continue to be required because their ( @entity3 military ) special operations capabilities are going to take a little bit more time to nurture and mature , " according to @entity130			0
opinion : @entity146 - on - blue attacks show there 's no easy way out			0

last of 30,000 extra troops sent in late 2009 have left @entity3 , an official says
about 68,000 @entity2 troops remain in @entity3
@entity6 has *pledged* to have most all coalition troops out by 2014
