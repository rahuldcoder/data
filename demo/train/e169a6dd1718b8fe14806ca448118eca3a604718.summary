-- even if you 've never visited @entity3 or @entity4 , it 's likely that you 've made contact with these countries through the chocolate bar you 've just eaten or the soap you 've just washed your hands with			1
over 87 % of palm oil , a common ingredient in thousands of consumer commodities , was produced by the two countries in the past year , according to the @entity14 ( @entity14 )			1
palm oil remains solid at room temperature , making it a remarkably versatile commodity used in cooking and processed food products like ice cream and cookies , as well as biofuels , agro-chemicals , and consumer products such as soaps , detergents , and cosmetics			1
as a result , demand for palm oil has been steadily rising since the 1970s , making it hugely valuable â € ” and profitable			1
last week , @entity3 state - owned palm oil conglomerate @entity31 debuted on the @entity33 stock exchange in the world 's second largest @entity34 ( @entity34 ) this year			1
the share price of the world 's third largest palm oil operator rose by 20 % , generating us $ 3.2 billion for the company			2
while the @entity34 has been a boon for the company 's coffers , conservationists say the palm oil industry has been a curse for the environment in @entity3 and @entity4			1
palm oil production threatens tropical forests , peatlands , and wildlife habitats , environmental groups such as @entity47 say			1
more than 10 % of deforestation in @entity3 and @entity4 over the last 20 years occurred to make way for palm oil plantations , according to a report by the @entity56 ( @entity56 )			1
in @entity4 , an average of 300,000 hectares is lost annually to palm oil clearing , the report said			1
one of the major consequences of deforestation is the effect on climate change			0
" because forested land , especially forested peatland , has a high carbon density , the production of palm oil on deforested lands causes disproportionately greater ... global warming emissions than an equal area of non-forested land , " according to the @entity56 report			2
the group estimates that growing and refining each metric ton of crude palm oil produces the equivalent of 0.86 metric ton of carbon dioxide or 860 kilograms			2
each hectare of carbon - rich peatland drained to plant oil palms releases an estimated 3,750 - 5,400 tons of carbon dioxide over 25 years , said @entity84 , a forest campaigner at @entity4			0
by comparison , he said , 500 - 900 tons of carbon dioxide are released from clearing a hectare of tropical forest without peat bogs			0
oil palms also have less biomass than the natural forests they replace , meaning the trees store much less carbon dioxide , according to @entity56			0
once oil palms reach the end of their productive life cycle , the destruction of their timber also returns carbon to the atmosphere			0
to harvest palm oil in an environmentally safe way , high carbon stock forests , peatlands , and high conservation value forests must be avoided for development , said @entity84			1
he added that the @entity111 government has routinely granted concessions for oil palm development in forested areas , which has led to widespread deforestation in @entity116 and @entity117			0
the @entity56 also claims the government issues land leases on favorable terms to an elite , influential pool of investors			0
for example , the @entity123 , which owns one of the country 's leading palm oil growers - refineries , is controlled by the powerful @entity129 family empire			0
the company has been an ongoing target of heavy criticism from green groups for contributing to mass deforestation and the endangerment of wildlife			2
over the past five years , @entity47 has launched campaigns against snack food conglomerates , including @entity139 and @entity140 , after finding their products , such as @entity140 's @entity143 chocolate bars , contained palm oil sourced from the @entity123			2
deforestation forces large animals , such as tigers , elephants and orangutans , into small and isolated pieces of natural habitat , according to @entity84			0
while the campaigns increased consumer awareness and provoked @entity139 and @entity140 to suspend their contracts until @entity156 improved its practices , much work remains to be done to make the palm oil industry sustainable , environmental groups say			1
for its part , the @entity4 government implemented a two - year moratorium on new permits to clear primary forests in may 2011 , in a us $ 1b deal with @entity165 intended to reduce greenhouse gas emissions stemming from deforestation			0
others point out that the palm oil industry has significantly alleviated rural poverty in @entity4 , where over 10 % of the rural population lives below the poverty line			1
according to @entity174 , over 41 % of palm oil plantations were owned by small landowners in 2008 , producing 6.6 million tons of palm oil			2
the palm oil industry contributes approximately 4.5 % of gross domestic product in @entity4 , according to the @entity14			1
@entity31 manages nearly 425,000 hectares of land in @entity3 and @entity4 , the majority of which is used for oil palm cultivation , according to its website			1
its associate company , @entity184 , produced 3.3 million tons of crude palm oil in fiscal 2011 , according to company spokesman @entity186			2
@entity186 said that company 's last plantings of oil palms occurred in the 1990s			0
" going forward , in newly acquired areas , where it involves planting in secondary forest areas , @entity31 will only do so after conducting high conservation value assessment , " he said			0
" we will only proceed if the findings indicate that no wildlife or endangered species will be affected , nor any social conflicts will arise from the development of the land			0
" the company has a program in place to obtain certification from the @entity205 ( @entity205 ) for all 70 of their palm oil mills by 2017 , according to @entity186			0
he said that only eight mills are currently certified .			0
