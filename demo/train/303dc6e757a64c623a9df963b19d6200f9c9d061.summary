-- violence in the @entity4 is not related to illegal @entity2 immigrants , but violence in @entity2 is connected to vast shipments of weapons from the @entity4 , @entity2 's foreign minister told @entity0 thursday			1
foreign minister @entity11 pointed to efforts by @entity2 to stop the flow of weapons , the great majority of which come from the @entity4			1
" since 2006 , " she said in a wide - ranging interview with @entity0 's editorial board in @entity19 , " the @entity2 government has seized over 85,000 weapons in @entity2			1
" she noted that it 's not just " regular weapons , " but also machine guns , grenades and other high - power arms			1
@entity25 , a @entity26 national security adviser for president @entity27 in the late 1970s , pointed out last year there were at least 6,600 @entity4 gun shops within 100 miles of the @entity2 border and more than 90 percent of weapons in @entity2 come from the @entity4			1
in contrast , @entity11 said , there 's no evidence linking high crime rates with illegal immigration , as some @entity4 politicians have contended			1
the two largest latino populations in the @entity4 are in the @entity19 and @entity40 areas , she said , but both locales have seen a " dramatic drop in the crime rate			1
" government and police statistics show that the crime rate has been decreasing in @entity19 for the past 15 years			2
similarly , statistics show that rate for most major crimes in @entity40 also has fallen in recent years			0
" this clearly shows that linking immigration directly with violence is not connected , " @entity11 said			0
others make the case , however , that illegal immigration and high crime are strongly linked			2
supporters of @entity61 , the controversial @entity62 immigration law , parts of which were struck down in federal court in july , used that argument to pass the bill this year			0
" border violence and crime due to illegal immigration are critically important issues to the people of our state , " @entity62 gov. @entity66 said earlier this year			1
" there is no higher priority than protecting the citizens of @entity62			0
we can not sacrifice our safety to the murderous greed of the drug cartels			0
we can not stand idly by as drop houses , kidnappings and violence compromise our quality of life			0
" but statistics from the @entity87 agency and the @entity88 indicate that both the number of illegal crossers and violent crime have decreased recently			1
according to the @entity88 , violent crimes reported in @entity62 dropped by nearly 1,500 incidents between 2005 and 2008			0
reported property crimes also fell , from about 287,000 incidents to 279,000 in the same period			0
these decreases are accentuated by the fact that @entity62 's population grew by 600,000 between 2005 and 2008			2
according to the non-partisan @entity100 , proponents of the bill " overlook two salient points : crime rates have already been falling in @entity62 for years despite the presence of unauthorized immigrants , and a century 's worth of research has demonstrated that immigrants are less likely to commit crimes or be behind bars than the native - born			1
" @entity11 also addressed comments by secretary of state @entity113 earlier this month comparing @entity2 's drug war to an " insurgency " similar to the problem @entity117 faced more than 20 years ago			1
" [ @entity121 ] e face an increasing threat from a well - organized network , [ a ] drug - trafficking threat that is , in some cases , morphing into or making common cause with what we would consider an insurgency , in @entity2 and in @entity131 , " @entity118 said at a speech to the @entity120			1
" it 's looking more and more like @entity117 looked 20 years ago			2
" @entity2 officials , from president @entity133 on down , took exception to that characterization			1
@entity11 reiterated the point thursday			0
" the realities are very different , " she said			0
@entity117 , she said , was fighting drug - producing and drug - trafficking organizations that also were working with an entrenched @entity141 guerrilla movement			0
" in @entity2 , " she said , " the situation is very different			1
in @entity2 , we are dealing with very powerful and strong transnational criminal organizations			2
" @entity11 also addressed the issue of drug cartels spreading south to @entity131 nations , which seems to have become a bigger problem in recent years			0
" the world is becoming smaller every day , " she said , adding that " transnational organized crime does not recognize any borders			2
" and while the problem is not particularly new , she said , " what has changed is the power of these transnational crime organizations			2
" @entity11 said some governments in @entity131 have gotten weaker or do n't have the technological capabilities to fight crime , and the drug cartels have taken advantage			0
" they have found a place to develop their activities , " she said			0
@entity0 's @entity164 contributed to this report .			0

crime rates have decreased in @entity169 areas of the @entity4 , says @entity2 's foreign minister
but large numbers of guns are flowing from the @entity4 to @entity2 , she says
some *analysts* note there are 6,600 @entity4 gun shops within 100 miles of the @entity2 border
