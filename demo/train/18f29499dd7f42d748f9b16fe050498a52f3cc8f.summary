-- about 11 trillion gallons of rain , or nearly 17 million @entity3 swimming pools full			0
that 's how much water @entity7 needs to recover from its extreme drought despite downpours that caused flooding and mudslides this month , @entity4 said			1
this week , the space agency released a satellite data analysis of how much water the state 's reserves lack			1
it 's a lot -- more than 14,000 times the amount of water it would take to fill the @entity21 stadium , according to @entity0 calculations			2
it 's the amount of water that flows over @entity25 in about 170 days ' time			0
" it takes years to get into a drought of this severity , and it will likely take many more big storms , and years , to crawl out of it , " said @entity4 scientist @entity27 , who led the study			1
@entity4 climate satellites measured fluctuations in @entity38 's gravitational field and the changing shape of the planet 's surface to determine the drop in water reserves			1
it 's the first calculation of its kind to determine the amount of water needed to break a drought , the space agency said			1
virtually all of @entity7 is drought stricken , according to the @entity52 drought monitor , most of it under the worst level -- " exceptional drought			2
" @entity56 boosted state reservoirs december 's deluges doused parts of @entity7 in just a few days with double the rain or more that they usually get in a year			1
an atmospheric river -- a moisture - laden stream of air from the tropics dozens of miles wide -- hosed the coast , and behind it , storm fronts battered the state			1
nearly a foot of rain fell in some places in a single day			0
creeks and rivers previously flowing at a trickle swelled over their banks and flooded nearby streets			0
the abundant rainfall gave the state 's reservoirs an upward bounce , according to measurements by the @entity83			0
one of the largest , @entity84 , went from a water level before the rains of 41 % of its historic average to 53 % on tuesday			0
another very large one , @entity90 , stepped up from a level of 44 % of its average volume to 54 %			0
some of the state 's other 10 -- mostly much smaller -- main reservoirs felt a boost , too			2
others , not so much			0
more rain is in the forecast this week , but it will be gentle , not torrential			0
despite the new rain , @entity7 's mighty reservoirs still resemble ponds surrounded by parched , elongated banks			1
depleting groundwater the drought has dug so deep in the past three years that it has tapped into groundwater			1
it has done this throughout the @entity108 , where groundwater levels are at their absolute lowest levels in the last 65 years , said @entity4 's @entity111 in @entity112			1
the state 's two largest river basins , the @entity115 and @entity116 , have lost 4 trillion gallons of water per year since 2011 , according to the analysis by @entity111			1
" that 's more water than @entity7 's 38 million residents use each year for domestic and municipal purposes			1
about two - thirds of the loss is due to depletion of groundwater beneath @entity7 's @entity127 , " @entity4 said			1
in september , gov. @entity130 signed " historic legislation " that created " a framework for sustainable , local groundwater management for the first time in @entity7 history , " the governor 's office said at the time			1
before the new legislation , @entity7 was the only @entity138 state that did n't manage its groundwater , officials said			2
@entity130 declared a drought emergency , saying this was " perhaps the worst drought that @entity7 has ever seen since records ( began ) about 100 years ago			2
" he held up a chart of fluctuating rainfall levels over many years , with the graph plummeting off the bottom of the chart in recent years			0
diminished snow caps the atmospheric river and cold fronts loaded up the @entity153 mountains with a couple of feet of snow at the highest altitudes , adding to the snowpack			2
it acts as a major water reservoir , storing up moisture in the winter months and then releasing it during melts			0
the storm 's extra padding doubled the level to 48 % of the historic average , a nice improvement			0
but there 's bad news here , too , based on studies done from airplanes this year , @entity4 said			2
" the 2014 snowpack was one of the three lowest on record and the worst since 1977 , when @entity7 's population was half what it is now , " said @entity111 scientist @entity174			2
that not only means less water from snow but also less reflection of sunlight , which means the @entity38 absorbs it and gets that much warmer , @entity174 said			0
the ground then also gets more parched , so when water does flow onto it , it soaks it up , leaving less of it to flow into reservoirs			0

@entity56 during the atmospheric river give reservoirs a *pleasant* boost
but much more is needed after years of drought , @entity4 says in a new analysis
satellites measure gravitational field and planet 's shape to find changes in water reserves
water reserves have fallen so far , @entity7 is depleting its groundwater
