@entity2 -- " does this mean i must now carry my passport everyday ? " my wife @entity0 wondered aloud with a mix of bemusement and exasperation			1
she was reacting to news reports that @entity2 had started a 100 - day campaign to " clean out " expatriates illegally living or working in the @entity13 capital			1
until the end of august the @entity14 has decreed that all resident foreigners are expected to show their passports for " spot checks " of visas and resident permits			1
hinting at stern measures for violators , a campaign poster features an image of a giant fist			2
police have conducted a sweep of communities where expatriates frequently congregate , like the university belt and the @entity32 district of the city , which boasts an eclectic array of shops , restaurants and bars			2
but finding violators may not be easy			0
there are almost 200,000 foreign residents in @entity2 on short - term or long - term visas , according to the @entity42 , which quotes police sources			1
mood darkens amid crackdown on ' illegal foreigners ' the campaign has enlisted the help of the @entity13 public , who can call a telephone hotline to report " suspicious foreigners			1
" violators will be fined , detained or even deported			0
however , the crackdown has made the expat community in @entity2 uneasy , with many wondering why the authorities have decided to take action now			2
@entity13 watchers wonder whether this is simply a preemptive measure to ensure security and stability months before the @entity62 hold its once - a - decade leadership transition later this year			1
a similar sweep was conducted several months before @entity2 hosted the @entity65			2
others see the high profile campaign as yet another hint of the xenophobic tendencies in the " @entity70			0
" days before the police campaign commenced , shocking videos purportedly showing a @entity73 national sexually abusing a @entity13 woman went viral on cyberspace			1
it prompted an avalanche of angry posts on social - networking sites			0
soon after the campaign was announced , @entity13 tv anchor @entity81 poured gasoline onto the fire when he posted scornful comments on his microblog calling for the expulsion of " foreign scum			1
" some observers say @entity13 has good reason to go after law - breaking foreigners			1
" the crackdown makes sense in the light of the large number of illegal migrants that have made it into @entity13 , some of whom may have been involved in illegal or violent activities , " said @entity93 , a professor at @entity95 's @entity94			2
but he said foreigners should be treated fairly and equally , according to law			0
crucially , the crackdown seems to be popular with many ordinary @entity13			2
" of course we should send home those foreigners who have entered illegally , just as we @entity13 wo n't be allowed in other countries without legal documents , " one @entity2 resident told @entity3			1
" to be a strong nation , you need not just a good economy but also strong diplomatic policies , " said another			0
" that shows a nation 's self - respect and dignity			0
" another resident was more blunt : " @entity13 as a big nation should get tougher			2
we 've been too soft for too long			0
" as @entity13 's economic and military might grow , the people 's pride and nationalistic feelings rise			2
there 's nothing wrong with promoting patriotism , experts say , but they warn against chauvinism			0
" the @entity13 have to be careful about underlying chauvinism which can lead them to behave inappropriately towards foreigners in the country , and in their foreign policy , " said @entity93			1
during the last century , @entity13 experienced how nationalism led to xenophobia during the @entity141 in the early 1900s -- when groups of peasants banded together to rid the country of foreign influences -- and the @entity146 ( 1966 - 76 ) , when @entity147 attempted to reassert revolutionary values in @entity13 by purging what he described as bourgeois influences			1
no one wants to experience xenophobia			0
i have seen how ugly it can be			0
like most foreigners who lived in @entity13 in the 1970s , i saw a closed , xenophobic society riddled with ingrained racial stereotypes			1
foreigners in @entity2 were virtually quarantined			1
while we enjoyed special privileges , such as access to special " friendship stores " , train compartments , hospital wards and beach resorts , we were cut off from spontaneous contact with ordinary people			0
diplomats and journalists were segregated in gated " foreigners ' compounds " , which we use to call foreign ghettos			1
local residents resented such special treatment			0
they often targeted foreigners with scorn and disdain			0
foreigners were disparagingly referred " waiguo guizi " ( foreign devils )			2
although infrequent , i do remember an anti-foreign backlash that led to occasional altercations and even rioting			0
to be sure , @entity13 has changed significantly since @entity184 launched his market reform and open - door policies in 1978			1
over the years it has gradually integrated into the global village through diplomacy , trade , tourism , academic exchanges and the media			0
but some expatriates in @entity2 still detect anti-foreign tendencies			1
" i find it difficult to understand why resentment is aimed at foreigners in general rather than at those who break the law or behave badly , regardless of nationality , " said one			0
" there is definitely an issue of @entity13 having stereotypical views on foreigners , and a very clear us - versus - them attitude , " said another			1
neither person wished to be identified			0
@entity13 scholars believe many @entity13 still harbor racist tendencies and lack the open - minded tradition of self - reflection when they feel or express such views			1
" this lack of self - reflection , " @entity93 opined , " allows for anti-foreignism to lurk under the surface			0
" that partly explains why , in its long and checkered history , @entity13 has capriciously swung from a sentimental love - affair with things foreign to angry rejection -- and back again			1
is xenophobia rearing its head again ? " this is not xenophobia , " a recent @entity226 editorial stated			0
" it is people 's desire to live in a civilized society			0
our government is under an obligation to make sure citizens live in a law - abiding country			2
the ongoing action against illegal immigration in no way compromises our hospitality to foreign guests			0
" that is the kind of reassurance that expatriates in @entity13 badly need .			1

@entity2 started campaign to " clean out " expatriates illegally living or working in @entity13 capital
there are almost 200,000 foreign residents in @entity2 on short - term or long - term visas
@entity13 citizens an call a telephone hotline to report " suspicious foreigners "
*analysts* wonder whether this is a measure to ensure stability before leadership change
