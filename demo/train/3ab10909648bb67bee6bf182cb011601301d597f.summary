@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity1 holds a presidential election tuesday with only one candidate on the ballot to replace longtime ruler @entity6			1
vice president @entity7 took over @entity1 's government in november , when @entity6 handed over power after months of protests			1
though @entity7 will be the only name on the ballot on tuesday , he has insisted on standing for election to make his presidency official			2
posters of @entity7 with slogans such as " a new president for a new @entity1 " have gradually replaced images of his predecessor			1
but some of those who took part in the protests that drove @entity6 from power after 33 years say they 're not particularly excited about tuesday 's vote			1
" maybe you can call them elections , " said @entity26 , an activist in @entity27 , the epicenter of the @entity30 movement			0
" but for me , elections should have more than one candidate			0
" the 65 - year - old @entity7 is a @entity36 - , @entity37 - and @entity39 - trained army officer , recently promoted to the rank of field marshal			2
he has served as vice president since 1994 and is running for a two - year term as president on pledges of improving security and creating more jobs			1
but he 's never had much of a power base of his own , and @entity1 's problems will take much longer to fix than the two - year mandate he 's expected to receive			1
it 's the poorest country in the @entity52 , with a severe shortage of water and rising levels of malnutrition among its population of about 25 million			0
even before last year 's upheaval , @entity6 faced a separatist movement in the south , sectarian tensions in its north and the growing presence of what @entity65 officials describe as @entity68 's most dangerous affiliate , @entity67			1
for some , particularly in the once - independent south , @entity7 is too closely tied to @entity6 's rule to represent any change			1
" why do people expect southerners to celebrate that @entity6 is gone ? " @entity74 , a prominent separatist leader in the southern port of @entity76 , told @entity2			1
" his regime is still in control , and his family still control all the major security factions in the country			0
we will not be tricked again , and southerners will not celebrate until complete change takes place in south @entity1			1
" there was heavy security in @entity76 for the vote , with at least 10 new checkpoints had been set up around the city			0
explosions rocked four separate neighborhoods late monday , with gunfire reported in one following the blast , but security officials told @entity2 that no injuries had been reported			0
explosions reported ahead of @entity1 vote @entity99 , a professor at @entity100 and another separatist leader , said @entity7 watched as @entity6 " oppressed us for more than two decades			1
" " i was imprisoned for three years because i expressed my opinion and rejected the corruption that @entity6 stood behind , " @entity99 said			2
" the old regime tortured me and made me suffer for years			0
@entity7 is part of the old regime , and will not be recognized as a southern leader			2
" but in @entity0 , @entity108 says @entity1 's people are looking to @entity7 to start the political reforms needed to save the country			1
" if he goes through with it , we will stand hand - in - hand with him , " she said			0
" if he does n't , or if we see a lot of game - playing between him and the government , i believe the youth will remain in the squares			0
they would say , ' leave , ' as they did to @entity6			2
" @entity6 handed over power to @entity7 as part of a deal brokered by @entity126 and will formally relinquish his office after tuesday 's vote			1
he is now now seeking medical treatment in the @entity130 for wounds suffered in a june assassination attempt at his presidential palace during weeks of street battles between government troops and tribal fighters			0
the @entity130 , meanwhile , has been backing @entity1 efforts against @entity68 and has periodically struck targets inside @entity1 , as in the september drone strike that killed @entity130 - born cleric @entity140			2
@entity141 , the @entity130 ambassador to @entity1 , told @entity2 that the transition laid out in the @entity126 plan as well as efforts to boost the economy and deliver basic services will be critical " in terms of our ability to defeat @entity68 and other violent extremist organizations in the country			0
" all of these elements are going to help us defeat @entity68 and eliminate them as a threat here in @entity1 , to the region and to the world , " @entity141 said			0
but for patrons in one @entity0 cafe , a bit of normalcy would be welcome			0
one man said @entity7 's first objective should be to " repair all the damage that was caused by the recent upheavals -- like the electricity crisis , like the gas crisis and all the crises in the country in general			2
" journalist @entity168 contributed to this report for @entity2 .			0
