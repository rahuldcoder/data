-- we 've seen this dynamic before : a mundane and wonky issue that many have never heard of suddenly elevates to national prominence			0
remember the debt ceiling and that it was mostly an unknown quantity five years ago ? this time it 's renewing the authority of this thing called the @entity9 to do business			1
the obscure independent agency provides loan guarantees to foreign companies struggling to secure financing to purchase goods from @entity17 manufacturers			1
but much of its financing goes to aircraft manufacturing giant @entity21 and costs taxpayers about $ 200 million per year , which critics contend wastes money and skews private markets			2
the agency 's authority to make loans expires september 30 and @entity29 is now tasked with deciding once again whether to renew it			2
is this government agency worth saving ? but it also is the latest battle emerging within the @entity33 , once again pitting the establishment against the tea party			1
@entity36 , ceo of @entity37 , the political arm of a similarly named conservative think tank and leading opponent , said the @entity9 is , " the purist form of corporate cronyism that exists in @entity43 " on the other side of the debate is @entity46 , senior director for international policy at the @entity17 @entity48 , which represents business interests in the capital			1
@entity46 said the bank 's demise would cost 200,000 jobs and that the chamber 's members nationwide are " scratching their heads about why this is such a big deal in @entity43			1
" the agency has been in place for nearly 80 years			2
@entity29 reauthorized it in 2012 , passing overwhelmingly despite some noisy @entity33 opposition			0
there was no @entity33 pushback to its previous reauthorization			2
why the controversy now ? with the rise of the tea party in 2010 and the resulting influx of lawmakers fiercely opposed to more government spending , the issue had the means to gain some traction			1
@entity36 said his organization devoted time and resources to lobby against and were " excited " to see 93 @entity78 members and 20 senators oppose it the last time around			2
@entity37 and other conservative groups , including @entity82 , @entity83 and @entity84 , have now had two years to gin up a coalition and pressure @entity29			0
in addition , rep. @entity87 of @entity88 , a fierce opponent of the bank , was elected to lead the committee that oversees it , helping to raise the profile of opponents			0
the bank has long had critics , but nothing has risen to the level where @entity29 might try to shut it down			0
the bank has been involved in numerous lawsuits , including by @entity99 and related groups who contend its lending practices boost foreign competitors through aircraft sales			0
environmental groups have also launched court challenges , opposing the bank 's heavy backing of fossil fuels			0
in a campaign address about cutting government waste , candidate @entity110 called the @entity9 " corporate welfare			1
" in the 1980s , @entity114 and @entity115 wrote in their book " @entity118 , the @entity119 and the @entity9 " that president @entity120 was " initially unsympathetic " as opposition from the left and the right rose			1
but neither @entity120 nor @entity110 tried to dissolve it			0
@entity110 now supports it and asked @entity29 to raise its borrowing cap and extend its authority for five years			0
the politics it 's also an election year and the issue was elevated last week because the newly elected @entity78 majority leader @entity132 , flipped his position and came out in opposition , emboldening the more conservative wing of the party			1
no. 2 @entity33 hates @entity9 bank his shift comes after his predecessor , @entity9 supporter and outgoing majority leader , @entity144 , lost his primary to @entity146 , who campaigned against corporate welfare			1
while the @entity48 and tea party - linked groups have been battling it out in @entity33 primaries , this issue is adding to the feud			1
" some see it as a prime opportunity to make a political statement , " @entity46 said			0
" that 's ' one of my biggest beefs right now			0
" neither @entity37 nor the @entity48 would discuss their political strategy , but both said that using this issue in campaigns is very likely .			0

the @entity9 is up for reauthorization
conservatives oppose the 80 - year - old institution
supporters say its demise would cost @entity17 jobs
it 's the latest battle between establishment and tea party - *aligned* *republicans*
