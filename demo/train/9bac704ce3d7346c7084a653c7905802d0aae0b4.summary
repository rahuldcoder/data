-- her curriculum vitae makes for impressive , if exhausting , reading			2
dr. @entity7 tells @entity0 her views on currencies , the @entity6 economy and whether women should be allowed to drive while fulfilling a demanding role as the first female head of a @entity6 investment bank -- which she founded -- dr. @entity7 also sits on the board of a number of private companies and business committees			1
she has twice been named businesswoman of the year , and has made @entity21 ' list of the world 's most powerful women			1
@entity24 found a spare moment to sit down with dr @entity7 , the founder , ceo and executive director of @entity28			1
@entity24 ( @entity29 ) : leading up to the @entity32 meeting in @entity33 , there was a great deal of not just speculation but even policy statements that this was the right time to de-peg from the @entity38 dollar			1
why the backtrack , almost at the last minute , in your view ? dr. @entity7 ( @entity41 ) : they believe that it 's a cycle not a trend			1
however , i have some concerns			2
having the dollar as a majority of this basket is not a problem , but it should be , it 's only wise to do this at the beginning , because they can not shift dramatically towards a flowing exchange rate or whatever , it should be a managed float			2
@entity29 : speaking of inflation , there 's a real number that 's put out by different governments in this region , and then the realities			2
what 's the real inflation right now because of the import cost rising with the weaker dollar ? @entity41 : as an economist you can measure the inflationary gap , which is the difference between the growth in the money supply and the growth in the real gdp			1
and this is , in @entity6 , 15 %			1
so the inflationary gap is 15 % , meaning that injection of money in the economy is not having an equal absorption capacity in the economy to create income			2
it 's just burning the money in consumption			0
@entity29 : let 's look out a little bit here into the future , you know , 5 - 10 years away			0
can you create a single market for the trading of goods , a greater air of free trade association that 's real that lowers barriers so you have more @entity101 trade ? @entity41 : the problem is that we all import the same thing , and we all export the same thing almost			0
so there is not really intra-trade between us that makes sense a lot			2
because for the @entity32 , for example , we all import everything from outside			1
what are we importing from each other ? nothing			0
almost , i mean a minority			0
but , that 's what 's needed in the future			0
if we go , for example , into production more like petrol - chemical and mining and whatever we should really create less barriers , and facilitate intra-trade and intra-production as well ... and go in mega-companies , not to have a petrol - chemical company in @entity6 and one in @entity131 and whatever , and compete , we should work more towards collaboration			1
@entity29 : is the formula correct ? when you drive the streets of @entity137 do you say i think we 'll get it right this time , the wealth that 's coming into the country , recalibrating what we want to do with @entity6 ? @entity41 : there is a big recognition that this boom is totally different than the first boom			1
at the first boom we did n't have any debt			0
now we have a government debt , and we have private sector debt			0
so we recognize that this wealth has to be wisely spent on projects for the future that can co-op with future demand			0
we have 60 % of our population under 24 - years - old , which are baby boomers hopefully we do n't want them to be the baby losers in the future			0
@entity29 : how about as a woman , do you think that it 's a bit strange that you ca n't drive on the streets but you can sign multi-million or billion dollar deals ? @entity41 : i will leave this to my dearest @entity166 , to decide			0
i know he 's supportive and he will have it very soon , in the right time			0
i can not go against the wind , but driving for women is definitely a necessity now , it 's becoming an economic need			1
