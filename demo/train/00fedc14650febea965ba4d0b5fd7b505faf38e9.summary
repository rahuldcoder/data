@entity0 -- women have long dominated the heated discussion around gender equality			1
but one group not engaging in the conversation is men , says @entity9 coo @entity8			1
what 's more , in her new bestseller " @entity10 , " @entity8 argues gender parity is impossible without them			1
" i think it is too hard for men to talk about gender , " says @entity8			1
" we have to let men talk about this ... because we need men to talk about this if it is ever going to change			0
" and with men at the helm of most large companies , engaging the other 50 % of the population in the gender debate is the key to gender equality , she says			1
" i do n't think men should be part of " lean in " or part of equality because it 's nice for women			1
they need to be part of it for themselves ... as managers and as peers in the workforce this is a competitive advantage for men			0
" if 86 % of the top jobs are held by men and they tend to be older than the women who have just joined their companies , inviting this group of decision makers to help mentor women into top roles is the logical way forward , explains @entity8			1
" [ for ] every man out there , it should be a badge of honor to mentor young women			1
not something you 're ashamed to do , not something you 're afraid someone will assume something bad , but a badge of honor that you are willing to spend your time giving the benefit of your experience to young women in the workforce			1
" as a female leader who has only worked for men and been mentored by men , her track record and success is proof in itself			0
" i 've never worked for a woman			0
most women , if they get senior , have never worked for a woman , because again , 86 percent of the top jobs are held by men			2
i 've had great mentors and great sponsors and part of @entity10 is trying to help people find the right way to develop those mentors and sponsors			0
" as a @entity95 graduate , she was selected to join the @entity96 by her former professor , @entity97 and later went on to become his chief - of - staff at the @entity99 after working at @entity100 and earning her @entity101 in the midst of moving to @entity103 and then @entity9 , @entity8 wed and had two children , a boy and a girl			1
but @entity8 's book -- what she calls " a sort " of feminist manifesto -- has n't been without critics			1
the @entity9 executive received overwhelming reactions from female columnists at @entity115 and the @entity116 as well as authors specializing in gender workplace issues			1
one notable reaction came from @entity120 , who runs a global management consultancy , 20 - first , that helps companies achieve greater gender balance			0
in a recent @entity126 article , @entity120 argues @entity8 is insulting women by suggesting they need to be more like men to succeed and even suggests she 's blaming them			1
" we 've never , in all of human history , seen a generation of brighter , better educated or more ambitious women , " she writes			0
" they have the keys			0
we just still have n't figured out how to adapt our organizations to optimize their talents			0
" but @entity8 explains her point is quite the contrary			2
" i 'm not telling women to be like men			2
i 'm telling us to evaluate what men and women do in the workforce and at home without the gender bias			2
" what 's more , @entity8 has also noticed it is women , not men who 've been most vocal about the book			1
@entity152 : 10 most powerful women in tech " most of the debate about " lean in " has been women , especially the first couple weeks before the book was out			2
the most surprising thing was that no man said a word			0
i could n't find a man writing a line , not saying a word			0
" @entity8 is n't just pointing out the stalled feminist revolution ; she also offers a solution with @entity167 , a not - for - profit foundation that will help spur change by offering women the ongoing inspiration and support to help them achieve their goals			2
funded by her book and corporate sponsors , the foundation will allow professional women to review social science research , share stories and receive online training and practical advice on career development -- to help women " take a seat at the table "			2
" @entity10 is not about fixing women			0
and it 's certainly not about any one person doing this on their own , " she asserts			0
" @entity10 is about all of us coming together to understand the stereotypes that are holding women back and fix them			0
and to start having an honest conversation about women in the workplace			0

men need to engage in the workplace gender equality debate , says @entity8
@entity8 says it should be a ' badge of honor ' to mentor women into top roles
@entity9 coo has written a book , which has received mixed response from critics
