-- world leaders are often measured by what they do in their first 100 days in office			0
but what about business leaders ? as of friday , it has been 100 days since @entity8 co-founder and longtime ceo @entity7 passed the company torch to @entity12			1
since that first day , august 24 , @entity13 and legions of @entity8 fans have had their gazes fixed on @entity12			1
as the man heading arguably the most influential and valuable technology company in the world , @entity12 wields a great deal of power			2
after @entity12 took over , @entity7 held the role of executive chairman but lost his long battle with cancer some six weeks later , on october 5			1
the day before @entity7 died , @entity12 led a news conference to announce the @entity27			1
" i consider it the privilege of a lifetime to have worked here for 14 years , " @entity12 said at that event			2
" i am so incredibly proud of this company			0
" analysts described the presentation as crisp but lacking the excitement of a @entity7 production			2
" it 's not going to be the @entity7 show that generates headlines worldwide , " @entity38 , an analyst at @entity40 - based market research firm @entity39 who attended the keynote , said in a recent interview			2
" these events are n't going to be the same as they ever were			0
" even without @entity7 ' dramatic stage presence , the @entity27 became the fastest - selling phone over its launch weekend , selling 4 million units worldwide			2
financial analysts worried that the aging glass - and - steel design would stunt sales , but the faster processor , better camera and @entity57 voice assistant -- plus the addition of a third major carrier , @entity59 -- helped the smartphone maintain momentum			0
@entity57 , which @entity8 describes as beta software , has experienced occasional outages since its october launch , but @entity66 has fared much better than @entity8 's previous endeavors into internet services			1
about 20 million people activated their free @entity66 accounts in its first week , @entity8 said			0
@entity71 , a $ 25 - a - year music synchronization service , was delayed by a few weeks but has received positive reviews			0
like @entity7 had done , @entity12 began e-mailing with some customers			1
he also personally addressed an inquiry by e-mail from @entity77 , the president of a pro-choice foundation who was writing in response to a controversy over @entity57 directing abortion questions to pro-life clinics			0
" these are not intentional omissions meant to offend anyone , " @entity12 wrote			0
so after a few robust launches , and a few bumps in the road , where do @entity12 and @entity8 go from here ? @entity7 recruited @entity12 from @entity92 in 1998 to run @entity8 's operations			1
people who have worked with @entity12 at @entity8 describe him as quiet and confident , the peacekeeper at the conference room table			1
he 'd entrust a roomful of @entity8 employees with company secrets and expect trust in return , according to @entity102 , a former consultant for the company			0
@entity7 was hands - on in product development and had a knack for identifying which markets were ripe for invasion			0
@entity110 's new " @entity7 " biography reveals that digital textbooks and @entity113 - enabled tv sets were among @entity7 ' next areas of focus for @entity8			1
in the book , @entity7 said @entity12 is " not a product person			1
" analysts say @entity7 provided guidance on products that would n't see store shelves for at least another year			2
but by august 2013 , @entity7 ' magic touch is likely to have worn off and the products will be those of a @entity12 regime , said @entity127 analyst @entity126			1
@entity12 has n't been given reasons to run away from the challenge			0
he will be able to lean on a " strong bench " of executives that @entity7 recruited and that @entity12 has long worked with , said @entity38 , the analyst			1
" it 's going to be business as usual for @entity8 in @entity7 's absence , " he said			1
shortly after taking over , @entity12 broadened the role of @entity137 , a longtime executive working with @entity7			1
@entity137 is now the senior vice president of cloud services , which includes overseeing @entity66 and @entity140 , the fledgling mobile advertising unit			0
to give @entity12 a strong financial incentive to stay , @entity8 's board of directors granted him a million shares of restricted stock			1
the first half will be made available to him five years from when @entity12 officially became ceo , and the rest will vest five years after that , as long as he stays			2
@entity12 had promised in a recent e-mail to his staff that @entity8 would n't change under his leadership , but he introduced at least one corporate program that would have been out of character for @entity7			1
in september , @entity8 began matching employees ' charitable contributions up to $ 10,000			0
@entity7 was not much of a philanthropist			0
" @entity7 made our world a better place , " @entity12 said at the @entity8 memorial for @entity7			1
" he left his fingerprints all over society , all over the world			0
he also leaves behind a company that only he could have built and a spirit that will be the foundation for this company forever			0
