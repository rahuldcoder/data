@entity0 took out the 2015 @entity2 on faster soft tires for the first time friday and the result looks ominous for the team 's rivals ahead of the new season			1
last year 's champion constructor had been content to allow world champion @entity10 and @entity0 rack up the laps on medium compound tires but in the afternoon session at the @entity16 , the @entity14 star was given his head			1
he lapped in one minute 22.792 seconds , a full 0.7 seconds quicker than the next best of @entity19 in the @entity20			1
it was also over a second better than his nearest rival on the day , @entity19 's teammate @entity24 of @entity25			2
with the opening grand prix of the season in just over a fortnight in @entity29 , @entity2 has laid down the groundwork to repeat its 2014 triumphs where it won 16 of the 19 races			2
not least because it has run for over 1,000 laps in the three pre-season tests at @entity35 and @entity16 , which end sunday			1
@entity36 -- with @entity37 scoring three impressive wins -- was its closest rival but the @entity29 's best time set thursday on soft tires was one minute 24.574 , considerably off the @entity2 pace			1
@entity44 boost @entity45 , with @entity44 new to its ranks , has showed signs of improvement and the four - time world champion got a best of the day 143 laps under his belt			2
there was better news as well for the @entity1 - sponsored @entity57 - @entity56 team which suffered a further setback when two - time world champion @entity59 was hospitalized after a crash sunday at the same circuit			0
the @entity62 left hospital wednesday and has posted a @entity65 message saying he was " completely fine " and would be taking his place on the grid for the season - opener in @entity69			0
in his absence , teammate @entity70 has been playing desperate catch up with their rivals on the grid			0
the 2009 world champion totaled 101 laps in the @entity78 , which has been plagued with teething problems , but the session ended on a low note when it stopped on the track to cause a red flag			0
@entity84 also finally unveiled its @entity86 car for the new campaign and @entity88 managed 76 laps			0
@entity90 to return ? in other @entity92 news , @entity90 has been included on the official entry list for the new season			1
financially - troubled @entity90 came out of administration this month after failing to take part in the final three races of last season when its cash ran out			0
it was also still reeling from the horrific crash of its star driver @entity102 at the @entity104 @entity103			0
@entity106 's @entity105 has been confirmed as its first driver and is set to take his place on the grid at @entity110 on march 15			1
@entity105 raced in last season 's final race in @entity113 for @entity114 , another struggling team , which has been scrapped from the 2015 list after failing to find new funding .			0
