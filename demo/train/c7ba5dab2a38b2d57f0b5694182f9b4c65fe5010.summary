-- this week , in a scene not witnessed during the 30 - year rule of @entity5 , the @entity2 presidential palace was encircled with barbed wire as thousands of protesters opposing president @entity8 besieged it from all sides			1
the visual is shocking , considering that a few short months ago , @entity8 stood without a shield to give a speech to thousands in @entity13			1
most experts would agree that @entity5 did not start out as the dictator he ultimately became			1
indeed , the oppression , torture and crackdown on opposition his regime was known for grew gradually over the years before reaching the height of brutality in his last term			0
it also took at least 10 years of determined commitment by activists and opposition to make change			0
the opposition grew from a few people beaten by police while peacefully protesting on the stairs of the @entity33 to more organized groups such as @entity35 and april 6 , to the massive citizens uprising of january 25 , 2011			0
but in just a few months , @entity8 already has deployed all the ingredients of authoritarianism : intimidating media outlets , defaming opposition and casting doubt on their patriotism and intentions and using violence and detention against protesters			1
on november 22 , @entity8 finally crowned these atrocities with a constitutional declaration granting him complete power over the executive , legislative and judiciary authorities , with no accountability			1
when the act was denounced at home and abroad , @entity8 claimed that these are temporary measures were required to protect the revolution and help the transition to democracy			1
what has followed have been the opposite of democratic			0
explainer : what 's driving @entity2 's unrest ? @entity8 quickly announced that there would be a december 15 referendum to vote on the new draft constitution that was rushed through by the @entity70 - dominated constituent assembly			1
the majority of liberal and secular voices had already boycotted the committee over a lack of transparency in the drafting process			0
despite protests , strikes and a declaration by federal judges that they will not monitor what they consider to be an illegitimate referendum , @entity8 shows no sign of reversing course -- ignoring opposition in the fashion of @entity5			1
but @entity5 was not democratically elected			1
then why is @entity8 moving so frantically to consolidate his power without even attempting to disguise it behind a democratic facade ? the answer is , @entity8 is not stupid			1
he is aware that he only won by a 1.7 % margin			0
a substantial number of his voters favored him only to avoid another era of military rule at the hands of his opponent , @entity5 's ex-prime minister , @entity97			1
in fact , the @entity99 opposition arguably represents the majority , but only failed to mobilize for the election because it was deeply fragmented and disorganized			0
but @entity8 's coup has done what some thought impossible : unite the liberal / moderate opposition			1
outside observers applauded @entity8 's early decisions -- such as dismissing the heads of the @entity110 , releasing military prisoners and banning pornographic websites -- as surprising and bold			1
however , these decisions were either populist or designed to appease his constituency of @entity70			0
@entity8 avoided making any painful , but essential , decisions , such as lifting subsidies , increasing prices of utilities and dealing with unemployment			2
but @entity8 has made three major miscalculations			2
first , he made appeasing his own constituency a bigger priority than winning over the opposition			0
this helped them to unify against him			0
second , he assumed that he would be immune from international criticism after his celebrated success in brokering a cease - fire between @entity129 and @entity130 earlier last months			0
finally , and perhaps most importantly , he underestimated the @entity2 people			2
the massive protests on tuesday , which included people of all ages , incomes and walks of life , showed that the @entity2 people no longer would accept dictatorship in any form			1
@entity140 : bloody clashes around @entity2 presidential palace the opposition has shaken @entity8 's misconceptions : the protests have been unified and included all political forces			1
meanwhile the international community is not so naive and realizes that the opposition is not simply a minority group that wants to restore the old regime , a scenario the @entity153 spokesmen publicly propagate			0
all is not lost for @entity8 if he is willing to change course			2
if he were to withdraw the declaration , call for a national dialogue and provide an opportunity for an inclusive space to redraft the current document of the constitution , there is hope for getting @entity2 back on track in its transition			2
at a minimum , he should extend the time frame for the referendum to open the door for a real national debate			0
this would not only spare the divided nation from descending into violent chaos but would also save @entity8 and his party			2
it is already evident that situation is only escalating , with more violent clashes wednesday between supporters and opponents of @entity8 in front of the presidential palace			2
there is no guarantee that even this will regain stability or restore @entity8 's legitimacy , but what is certain is that the longer he delays his response to the angry masses , the more irreversible the situation will be			2
the political dynamics in @entity2 have drastically changed since the revolution			0
foreign governments , particularly the @entity193 , should factor this into its approach to engaging with @entity2			0
this does not mean siding with one regime or playing one group against the other , but rather siding with the principles of freedom and democracy against oppression and authoritarian rule			0
the @entity2 are still waiting for the @entity206 administration to match its fine words with actions			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity211 .			0

@entity211 : in only a few months , @entity8 has provoked protests
she says this recalls @entity5 as @entity8 has *upended* constitutional process
she says he has miscalculated his *mandate* ; his actions have *galvanized* opposition
@entity211 : he can still reverse course ; @entity2 and world wo *n't* stand for authoritarianism
