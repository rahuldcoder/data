i did not know @entity2 , the @entity3 aid worker and @entity5 hostage whose death was confirmed by her family this week			1
but like many people who read her letter to her family , i wish i had			1
and in some ways i feel i have			1
in my two decades working in the humanitarian field responding to conflict , i have met some incredibly brave individuals who poured themselves into the work they did to build up the societies in which they were working			1
but at the same time , i have watched our ability to enter into places of need begin to disappear			1
one by one i have seen cities i love crumble			1
but the most painful thing has been watching our physical space and mobile access to do humanitarian and conflict mitigation shrink			1
long gone are the days when the @entity30 , a press badge or the @entity33 flag were perceived as neutral			1
the targeting of aid workers is not new			1
and it is not limited to the @entity38 or @entity5 strongholds -- it first came to international attention in @entity41 in the late 1990s , and became of true global note in the early 2000s in @entity44 and @entity45 as the blurred lines between civilian , military , aid workers , journalists , security actors and intelligence created a justification for extremist and terror groups to pursue anyone			1
in other words , we can not find our way in			1
when we do , we are seen as one of the aggressors or potential spies			1
we are seen as a commodity to embarrass @entity63 countries by exploiting the media to shape public opinion			1
we are , in short , targets			2
despite growing attention over the problem , little has been done to change this reality			2
instead , the response has been that the decades - long practice of civil society groups not having weapons on their premises or traveling in armored vehicles was reversed			2
more and more , civilian and military cooperation has been the only way to enter conflict zones , and security is now a necessary component to most organizations ' budgets			2
i do not know an aid worker , a war reporter or a conflict mediator who has not lost a friend in the past decade			1
@entity2 's death reminds many of us of those selfless individuals we 've encountered who worked , and were killed , while carrying out their humanitarian missions			1
i often remember my dear friend @entity94 , a woman i worked closely with in @entity95 in 2003 , who was kidnapped and killed in 2004			1
when i remember @entity96 and @entity97 , dear friends of mine who shared my passion for women 's rights in the southern governorates of @entity44 , i do n't remember the gunmen that killed them			1
when i think of @entity96 and @entity106 , i remember women who were so courageous that they took on the @entity108 to create women 's centers in southern @entity44			2
and i remember @entity111 , who traveled in and out of @entity45 and @entity44 to advocate for innocent victims of conflict			2
as i meet with the families of those who have been lost , i also experience a deep sadness , and survivor 's guilt that i should have done more , too			2
when i spoke with @entity96 's sister after she was brutally killed in @entity44 , i was sure she would have anger in her heart and be seeking to have someone to blame			1
i could not have been further from the truth			2
instead , she had lots of questions , all centered on wanting to support and know the women @entity96 believed so passionately in			2
@entity2 lived my worst fear			1
over and over , from @entity45 to @entity44 to @entity130 , my colleagues and i have agreed that death was far better than being kidnapped			2
we 've even discussed how we might get cyanide pills			0
we were ready to sacrifice our lives			0
yet it was unbearable to think of making a choice that would affect our loved ones			0
those who work in conflict know very well what other people call us			0
some call us emergency junkies			0
some say we are ambulance chasers			0
some say we have such meaningless lives , that we seek meaning through this work			0
perhaps there is truth in these labels			0
but the one thing i have in common with all my friends who work in conflict areas is idealism			0
we believe in the power of one individual to make change			0
i did not know @entity2			1
i do not know her family			0
but i hope that her family is hearing the same message i shared with @entity96 's sister			0
with the friends and family of @entity111 and @entity94			0
i hope they know beyond a shadow of a doubt she was loved by the people she served			0
that in addition to the entire global community , the vast majority of @entity172 and @entity173 are mourning her death as one of their own			0
most importantly , i hope the world knows none of those labels i mentioned describe her			0
she was not a naive idealist			0
she was part of a greater change and a rise in collective consciousness that will eventually lead to a global shift toward a better world			0
she will be remembered by those to which she fought to give a voice			0
she is an inspiration for many of us to continue our work -- to fight for access and demand for humanitarian space and conflict resolution			0
she is a true heroine .			0
