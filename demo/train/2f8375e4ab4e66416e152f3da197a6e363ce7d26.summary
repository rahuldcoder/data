@entity1 's beachfront promenade was whipped by thin sheets of rain as @entity5 and @entity6 sat at a seaside caf√© to have breakfast			1
the two photographers were still trying to shake off their morning tiredness , having just arrived at the coastal city after cycling some 1,600 kilometers from @entity14 , a town at the heart of @entity16			1
" just as the coffee arrived , i saw this guy fly by with no shirt on , riding this strange - looking bike , " recalls @entity5			2
" @entity6 and i just looked at each other and it was like , ' we 've got to get this guy ! ' @entity6 just said ' go , go , go , ' so i jumped on my bike and started chasing him in the rain			2
" it took more than seven kilometers and several screams before @entity5 finally managed to catch up with the shirtless rider -- named @entity30 -- and talk to him			1
" he stopped and allowed me to get his photograph and do a quick interview with him , " says @entity5			2
" he was on his way to work -- he works as a gym instructor -- but he told me an amazing story ; he 'd been traveling the world with that exact bike			0
" that story and photograph can be found in " @entity42 , " an image - led three - book series by @entity5 and @entity6 documenting @entity16 's bicycle commuter culture			1
starting in 2010 , the two friends and bike enthusiasts were keen to explore who cycles in the country and how their bicycles fit into their daily life			0
" we decided just to get on our bikes and cycle around and see who we would meet , " says @entity5			2
" it happened organically , " adds @entity6 , 34			0
" we did n't set out with a strict plan of what we wanted to do ... we were thinking maybe we 'll be working on it for six months			0
" read this : @entity61 draped in color for ' slave ' carnival instead , @entity6 and @entity5 ended up spending over three years on the project , cycling thousands of kilometers across @entity16 -- from big urban centers , through steep hills and mountains , to small towns and rural areas			1
along their journeys , they 'd speak to , photograph and sometimes even ride together with the cyclists they 'd meet on the road , people who used their bikes not for recreation but as an everyday way of transport -- everyone from die - hard commuters to people making a living from their makeshift bicycles			1
@entity5 and @entity6 say these " brave " and " inspirational " individuals , are defying dangerous roads and social prejudices by making the everyday decision to use bicycles to get around			1
" in @entity16 there 's no culture of commuting by bicycle , " says @entity5			1
" some of the friends that we made were really colorful and interesting people , very eccentric i would say , " he adds			0
" it 's really an alternative choice to ride a bicycle -- it 's often a choice that comes out of necessity because of the rising costs of transport and in fact people have to travel long distances to get to work			2
often people live in townships and they work in the cities where it 's actually very far from their home			0
" @entity6 and @entity5 , who turned to crowdsourcing website @entity114 to fund their project , say that riding a bicycle themselves helped them create an instant bond with the cyclists they 'd encounter , allowing different people from all walks of life to open up to them and have a friendly discussion			1
" there is a pride around having and using a bicycle , especially because in @entity16 it 's not being used as much for commuting , " says @entity6			1
" it kind of felt like you get a different holistic image of the country , after hanging out one on one with everyday people , " he adds			0
" a very different image of the country , of the situation and the state of racial interactions and political interactions ... than you get from , say , reading the newspaper or always being aware of the extremes			0
" the photographic project was published in december 2012 , yet that did n't signal the end of @entity6 and @entity149 's journey			1
since then , they have been on their bikes again , cycling back to meet the people featured in the books in order to give them a copy			1
" it was a very natural thing to do , " explains @entity6			0
" we never felt that the right thing was to pay anybody for their time or taking their photo -- that 'd be kind of compromising the integrity of it , " he adds			0
" as far as our project goes , it 's probably the best part of the experience			0
" it 's very rewarding being able to go back to someone and say , ' remember i met you two years ago , i took your photo and this is what i did with it , ' " he says			0
the two photographers have so far gone back to about 70 % of the people they 'd photographed and are still planning to visit the remainder 30 %			0
" people 's reactions are always very positive , " says @entity5			1
" they feel very proud , they really love it , it 's a nice feeling to make someone feel so proud and also ... when you 're able to give them a copy of the book , they can see themselves amongst other @entity16 that have a similar interest to them			2
and also the stories -- you can read a lot about other people 's personal history and culture and socioeconomic background , it 's just very interesting for these people			2
