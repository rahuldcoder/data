-- the @entity4 's practice of surgically castrating convicted sex offenders is " invasive , irreversible and mutilating " and should stop immediately , the @entity2 's @entity1 said in a report made public thursday			1
the central @entity8 country castrated at least 94 prisoners in the 10 years up to april 2008 , when investigators from the @entity2 , a human - rights forum , visited the @entity4			1
the @entity2 condemned the practice as " degrading			1
" the procedure is being performed even on first - time , non-violent offenders , such as exhibitionists , its investigation revealed			1
prisoners have to request castration under @entity4 law , but many fear they will be jailed for life if they do not , the investigation found			1
" in practically all the cases , these patients indicated that their application was at least partially instigated by fear of long - term detention , " the report said			0
" some patients claimed that the treating sexologist had explicitly told them that surgical castration was the only available option to them and that refusal would mean lifelong detention			2
" and it warned that some " significantly " mentally retarded people had been castrated			0
" in at least five cases , legally incapacitated offenders were surgically castrated , " the report said			0
" in all of these instances , the court - appointed guardian had signed the consent form ; in two cases , the guardians were mayors			0
" the investigators found only two convicts who had spontaneously volunteered for castration , while others they interviewed said mental health staff specializing in sexuality had recommended it			0
" the other patients interviewed indicated that the treating sexologist had suggested surgical castration , in several cases within a week of the patient 's admission to hospital , " the report said			0
" some of the sexologists interviewed by the delegation themselves affirmed that for certain patients there was no alternative treatment to surgical castration			0
" the @entity4 defends the practice as voluntary , saying castration aims permanently to reduce testosterone levels in order to diminish the offender 's sexual urges			1
the process , officially called " therapeutic testicular pulpectomies ... are performed upon a written request of an adult man , " the @entity4 government responded			2
it said the operation had to be approved by a committee of experts			0
" prior to the performance of such intervention , the patient must express his consent with its performance			0
castration is considered with respect to men who can not manage their sexual instincts and are sexually aggressive , " the @entity4 government said , saying the @entity2 had not proven its case sufficiently for the country to abandon castration			1
it argues the procedure is effective in reducing repeat offenses			2
but the @entity2 questioned the statistics on repeat offenses and said even if they were correct , castration was not an appropriate way to reduce recidivism			1
" the committee 's delegation came across three cases in which sex offenders had committed serious sex - related crimes , including serial rape and attempted murder , after they had been surgically castrated , " the human - rights group said			1
" surgical castration is no longer a generally accepted medical intervention in the treatment of sex - offenders , " the report said			1
it said candidates for castration often received information about the procedure which was too technical to understand -- or no information at all			2
" several patients who had undergone surgical castration told the delegation that they would never have applied for surgical castration had they been properly informed , " the report warned			0
it condemned the practice as " an irreversible intervention that always leads to infertility and , in the long run , a significantly increased risk of osteoporosis , " also warning of possible depression and changes in appearance			0
it said it was impossible to determine how many people had been castrated in keeping with a 1966 law			0
the @entity2 delegation visited the @entity4 from march 25 to april 2 , 2008			1
it issued its report and the @entity4 response on july 23 , 2008			2
it made them public on thursday at the request of the @entity4 government , it said .			2
