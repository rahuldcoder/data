( @entity6 ) -- a web site developed this year that allows students to share old exams online is causing debate among professors about its ethical implications			1
@entity21 creator @entity20 says the site is a tool for education , not for cheating			1
@entity21 is an educational tool that lets students anonymously upload materials and tests from their previous and current classes , said @entity20 , creator of the site			1
however , there are teachers who do not want their tests to be posted for every student to see			2
" i would not be happy if a student who had taken a class of mine had taken an exam and posted it online , " @entity35 , graduate professor of psychology at @entity3 , said			2
" i know that some teachers reuse past exams and it would be hard to have to write a new test for every class			2
" however , @entity46 , professor of chemistry at @entity3 , said she would n't mind if students posted her tests online			1
" for my classes i always write new exams every time , and i would n't object because i have some old exams up online that i 've posted myself , " @entity49 said			2
currently , there are no tests online for @entity3 , because the site was developed on the @entity57 , @entity20 said			1
" primarily the main audience is @entity59 , but that 's because i 've only advertised around there , " @entity20 said			0
he said he is looking into expanding the site more to include universities and colleges across the country			0
" also , although i am still focused on the @entity65 , in the future i would like to go global , " @entity20 said			0
" i think it would be really effective worldwide			0
" while studying for an exam in the @entity69 , @entity70 ( senior - nutrition ) said she would consider using the site			2
" i think looking at an old exam helps -- it at least gives the student an idea of how the teacher poses questions , " @entity70 said			0
while she said she would n't go through the trouble of posting a test herself , @entity70 said she did n't think students posting old tests online would be a problem			1
" most teachers give out practice exams and old exams anyway , " she said			2
" the only time i would think it would be a problem is if the teacher uses exams more than once			0
" in response to criticism of the site from professors , @entity20 said he wants people to know the site is a tool for education and not a tool for cheating			0
he added teachers can ban their exams from the site if they do n't want students sharing them online			1
" the first professor that banned his exams said he wanted to ban them because he was copyrighting them and publishing them in a book , and that made total sense to me , " @entity20 said			1
even with the option to ban tests , @entity111 said professors may not know the site exists and may not know to ban their exams from it			1
she said the site might be ok only if students get permission from their teachers to post exams online			1
@entity49 said the biggest problem she saw with students posting material online would be putting up tests the teachers wanted handed back in			1
" common sense needs to come into play with something like this because there 's a student responsibility side to it , " she said			0
" having access to an exam you 're not supposed to is cheating			0
" students should n't have to rely on old tests online to prepare for an exam from a new teacher , @entity35 said			1
" there are likely a lot of professors who would be happy to give students more of a sense of what the exam is going to be like -- maybe giving them sample questions , " she said			1
@entity49 warned students should use materials posted online wisely because looking at an exam may not always be the best way to study			1
" one problem is old tests may not be the most effective study tool , " she said			0
" by just going off of old exams students are n't learning how to actually do the problems			2
