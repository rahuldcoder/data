-- does the idea of spending time in the @entity2 with the @entity4 gang leave you thinking " oh , rats ! " ? does the idea of spending time with the hot people of @entity9 's trendy @entity8 leave you cold ? well , do n't give up on @entity10 just yet			1
there 's still a @entity10 for folks like us -- it 's " old @entity10			1
" ( and i 'm not talking retirement communities here )			2
sometimes thought of as " forgotten @entity10 , " i 'm talking about the more northerly portions of the state			1
it 's the part that thrived a century ago during the first waves of development but has been bypassed by most tourists in recent decades for @entity23 and points south			2
this is the @entity10 where the @entity26 intermingles with the tropics			1
here , oaks draped with @entity30 moss stand guard over saw palmetto and vivid flowers			2
they all thrive by crystal - clear rivers and springs			1
its towns are smaller , quiet and friendly			2
many of its attractions emphasize the natural environment			0
it 's a place for hiking , biking , kayaking , snorkeling , tubing and fishing			1
and you can enjoy it all without devastating your wallet and facing large or pretentious crowds			0
i made two visits down there this summer and fall			0
here are nine spots worthy of a visit : 1			0
this @entity63 fishing village , about 50 miles southwest of @entity61 , is gloriously isolated and seemingly of another era			1
there are no chain restaurants , hotels or grocery stores here ( or none that i ran across )			0
what you will find here : an unassuming town of modest and funky tin - roofed homes , a few ' 50s - style motels and quaint shops			1
lots of folks get around via golf carts and bicycles , which they do n't seem to ever lock up			0
art is a big part of the town , with all manner of public displays popping up			1
charter boats at the marina offer fishing excursions and exploration rides , including sunset cruises			1
with such a relaxed atmosphere , @entity59 has a bit of a @entity95 vibe -- minus the all - night party atmosphere			1
this is a town that goes mostly silent by 10 p.m. @entity59 's culinary fame is clam chowder			1
the @entity101 had such good chowder i went back for a second night			0
if you seek a traditional , white - sand beach with aqua @entity63 waters right at your doorstep , you need to go elsewhere			1
but if you want to escape to another time where simple pleasures rule , @entity59 is the place			1
@entity112 one word : @entity114			0
they got ' em , and you can see these gentle giants feeding on heads of lettuce from an underwater observation deck			0
this is a wonderful state park dedicated to native flora and fauna ( minus one hippo that is a holdover from another incarnation of the park )			2
the birds in particular are spectacular , but you can also see bears , bobcats and gators -- oh my ! do not skip the 15 - minute - or - so boat ride from the parking area to the animal displays , where they take you down a narrow , blackwater creek			1
you feel like you 're in a jungle			0
and you kind of are			0
at $ 13 for one adult , the admission is more than is typical for @entity10 state parks , but it 's worth it			1
@entity146 , @entity147 this is no ordinary swimming hole , unless you 've been dipping in a pool of chilly gin before			0
the water is that clear and that cool			2
@entity146 is one of several in @entity147 , a true gem of a wilderness that will evoke memories of " @entity156 " if you ever read that @entity159 - winning novel			1
if you get tired of swimming in the brisk , limpid waters , you can explore the lush surrounding forest on a boardwalk and trail			0
be sure to arrive early if you come on a hot summer weekend			0
@entity169 way down upon the @entity172 , far , far away from @entity10 's more crowded tourist sites , lies a pretty little state park not so far from @entity174 and an easy jump off @entity176			1
honoring @entity179 composer @entity178 , this park is perched by the famed river that looks like moving black glass contained by tall , white - sand banks			2
you ca n't swim here ( gators ) , but you can hike alongside the intriguing , mysterious waterway or go canoeing			0
you can also enjoy @entity178 exhibits , including old pianos and desks he used			0
check the park 's calendar -- they have various programs throughout the year			2
no need to bring your @entity197 ; the park 's 97 - bell carillon housed in an impressively tall brick tower provides the musical backdrop			2
the nearby town of @entity203 has some pretty old homes , too			1
@entity205 and @entity206 if you love oysters , you probably have heard about this place			1
if you do n't love oysters , you should still check it out			2
@entity205 oozes " old @entity10 " charm			1
set alongside a namesake bay and river , this town has one foot in the workday world of harvesting the @entity63 's riches and the other foot in artsy boutiques and the like			1
somehow , they combine nicely			0
up the @entity221 provides a fantastic view to enjoy a dozen oysters and a beer			2
be sure to venture out from the little business district			0
@entity205 has some lovely , meticulously maintained homes over which you 'll drool			1
i stayed across the bay in nearby @entity206 , which is even smaller , more blue collar and boutique - free			2
the @entity231 offers a great price			2
the rooms are dated and a bit stuffy , but the grounds , overflowing with foliage and overrun with peacocks , more than make up for it			0
and it is perfectly poised to take in awe - inspiring , multicolored sunsets			2
bring plenty o ' mosquito repellent lest that sunset be your last			0
@entity245 it 's often cited in top 10 @entity10 beach lists , and with good reason			1
this stretch of the @entity63 is stunning , and this park is poised to take full advantage			1
dune restoration and preservation are emphasized , and the park is a short drive from @entity206 and @entity205			1
if you 're not a fan of crowds , this is the place to be			0
this is a big place with miles and miles of beach unadulterated by condos , high - rises and general seashore tackiness			2
camping sites are available for folks who like to do that			0
@entity269 in the same general area as @entity245 , you ca n't go wrong with this park , either			0
if anything , i liked it a little more			0
there did n't seem to be as much beach and parking for visitors , but the green and blue waters and soft sands were just as inviting			0
what really sold me on @entity283 were the bayside trails ; they were nothing less than outstanding			0
i heard a symphony of birds and insects on my hike , and every turn of the trail revealed another splendid mix of green pines , brown marsh grasses , white sand , dark blue water and pale blue sky			0
this little slice of paradise costs gas money to drive there and 4 bucks for a single adult			0
a carload of folks gets in for $ 2 more			0
@entity305 @entity10 is truly blessed with freshwater springs , and @entity305 is another standout			1
not too far from @entity309 , it 's hard to find , but worth the trouble			0
the park has trails for hiking , but the big attractions are the swimming area and the one - hour riverboat rides , which are well worth the $ 8 for an adult			2
you get up close and personal with all manner of exotic birds , big fat alligators ( and i do mean big and fat ) and , if you 're lucky , a few manatees			0
we were striking it so rich with wildlife on our ride that our generous flat - boat captain let us stay out an extra 15 minutes			2
i had the cool swimming area to myself on a weekday in october , but i imagine it 's filled up with splashy , happy children in northern @entity10 's hot summer weekends			1
@entity335 and @entity336 i 'm an @entity337 kind of fellow , so i had to end with a nod to the salty waters i know best			1
you ca n't go any higher up and still be in @entity10			1
@entity335 and @entity336 definitely have a @entity174 / @entity344 kind of feel -- in a good way			1
the beach here is an @entity337 classic : wide and inviting			1
the gray water was still plenty warm for swimming in october			0
if you like riding waves , you get more action than typical on @entity63 beaches			1
@entity355 is definitely the most upscale of the places on this list , but it still had a down - to - earth charm			2
if you enjoy gawking at homes as much as i do , you 'll be in heaven here			0
6th street in particular seemed to be replete with @entity364 classics			0
for my last meal in " old @entity10 , " i skipped the seafood and ate at @entity367			1
go for the fun name			0
stay for the cozy courtyard and the pimento cheese sandwich			0
