@entity0 -- a day before @entity7 @entity6 's appeal of her murder conviction resumes in an @entity10 appeals court , the sister of slaying victim @entity3 vowed to keep fighting for justice on her behalf			1
" anyone reading this or following this case , please remember our beautiful @entity3 , " @entity13 said in a statement distributed sunday by attorney @entity15			2
" ... amongst the media frenzy that has developed throughout , @entity3 has been forgotten because she is no longer with us , yet this should be about her and what really happened on that tragic evening			1
" @entity23 and her ex-boyfriend , @entity24 , were convicted in the 2007 death of @entity13 , 21			1
@entity13 , a @entity26 exchange student , was found dead in the villa she and @entity23 rented in the central @entity10 university town of @entity29 , seminaked and with her throat slashed			2
@entity23 was sentenced to 26 years in prison , sollecito to 25			2
in july , the @entity10 appeals court heard testimony about new dna analysis that may call @entity23 's conviction into question			1
the proceeding will resume monday			0
at trial , authorities testified that a knife found in @entity24 's home had traces of @entity23 's genetic material on the handle and @entity13 's in a tiny groove on the blade			1
dna on @entity13 's bra was also traced to @entity24			1
those results have been contested by two court - appointed forensic experts , professors @entity51 and @entity53			0
@entity51 testified in july that the knife tested negative for blood and the amount of @entity46 said to be @entity13 's was so low , it could not be examined again with any conclusions			1
@entity51 and @entity53 also said there was no evidence the knife had been " thoroughly washed , " as prosecutors argued during the trial			0
prosecutor @entity63 questioned @entity51 regarding the standard sufficient quantity of @entity46 for valid testing , suggesting experts differ on the amount			0
meanwhile , they said , the clasp from @entity13 's bloodied bra , which allegedly contained @entity24 's dna , was " dirty " and had been allowed to rust , making further testing futile			1
the evidence , the two argued , should be " inadmissible			0
" " over the last week , we have waited anxiously and with great concern as the rumours surrounding the original dna evidence findings are spreading , " @entity13 said in the statement			2
it 's difficult for @entity13 's family to understand how the evidence , so carefully developed and presented at trial , could be deemed irrelevant , she said , and also to understand how a small amount could be useless when there is no determination of how much should be present			1
@entity23 's defense seems " to focus and rely heavily on these two pieces of dna evidence , but can we just remember for a moment what this case is actually about : my sister , a daughter brutally and selfishly taken from us nearing four years ago ... not a single day goes by that we can grasp any peace or closure			1
" she urged the public to remember the blood - splattered crime scene as well as 10,000 pages of evidence presented in the case			0
" we still have confidence in the @entity29 police and every faith in all those involved in court and the investigation , " @entity13 said			0
her family is asking that the appeals court assess each piece of evidence , " both scientific and circumstantial , as well as any witnesses who have taken the stand independently of any other information or media			0
" the @entity13 family has not forgotten @entity3 , she said , " and we will continue our fight for justice with the continued support of our lawyer @entity15 and his team , the police and prosecution and all those involved in @entity10 as well as everyone all over the world who still thinks of us and @entity121			1
" she said the family would like to work with the @entity131 in @entity29 to offer a yearly place to a student in @entity3 's name			2
" @entity3 loved @entity10 and its people and she wanted to immerse herself in the culture , " her sister said			2
" we are well aware of the impact this has had on the city and feel it would be an appropriate way of remembering @entity3 in the beautiful place she left us to study			0
" please do not let @entity3 die in vain , " @entity13 said			2
" her courage and strength fight on and we will seek justice so she can rest in peace			0
" her sister , she said , put up a fight for her life and did not give up , " and we will not give up now			0
" a third defendant , small - time drug dealer @entity3 , an immigrant from the @entity152 , was also jailed in connection with @entity13 's death			1
he was sentenced to 30 years for murder and sexual violence following a fast - track trial in 2008 , but his sentence was later cut to 16 years			0
@entity1 's @entity159 contributed to this report .			0
