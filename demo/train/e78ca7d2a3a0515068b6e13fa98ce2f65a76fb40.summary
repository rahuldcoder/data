-- national @entity2 leaders , fresh from a shellacking in congressional districts and statehouses from coast to coast , should wake up to the reality that the party 's path to electoral power runs through the streets , where an energized portion of the party 's base has been marching for many months			1
on three hot - button issues -- climate change , higher pay for fast - food workers and fairness in the criminal justice system -- left - leaning @entity21 have mounted sophisticated , passionate campaigns that have sparked and swayed public conversation			2
the question is whether @entity2 , whose electoral losses can be traced back to low voter participation , will follow the lead of activists whose numbers have been swelling throughout 2014			1
right now , things do n't look too hopeful			2
instead of drawing on the energy and creativity of the activists , @entity2 leaders are engaging in a round of finger - pointing , blaming one another for errors of timing and messaging that contributed to the recent electoral losses			1
sen. @entity43 of @entity44 , who as chairman of the @entity46 had the task of developing a winning message for the party this year , recently delivered an extraordinary speech chastising his fellow dems for pursuing president @entity53 's signature issue of health care reform			2
" unfortunately , @entity2 blew the opportunity the @entity21 people gave them			1
we took their mandate and put all of our focus on the wrong problem â € ” health care reform , " @entity43 said in a speech at the @entity58			2
" we should have done it			0
we just should n't have done it first			2
" that drew a sharp retort from @entity70 minority leader @entity69			0
" we come here to do a job , not keep a job , " she said in a statement to @entity0			0
" there are more than 14 million reasons why that 's wrong , " she added -- a pointed reference to the number of @entity21 now getting health insurance under @entity77			0
the feud is music to the ears of @entity84			0
" democrats are trying to figure out what they believe and who they represent " is how conservative columnist @entity85 put it			0
that may be overstating matters -- this is n't the " civil war " @entity85 describes -- but @entity2 clearly need to think about how and why they have n't been connecting with voters lately			1
@entity43 and @entity69 are both partly right			0
there 's no question that the titanic battle to extend health care to the uninsured was always a matter of helping a minority of @entity21 to finally get benefits that 85 % of us already enjoyed			0
most people , anyway you look at it , did not need @entity77 themselves ( although many had children and other relatives who benefited )			0
but as @entity69 and others pointedly reminded @entity43 , getting health benefits to 14 million people is a titanic achievement that @entity2 have been attempting for a generation			1
and the program helped @entity2 make inroads with @entity118 voters , whose support for @entity77 helped the @entity2 carry the @entity70 and hold a @entity121 majority in 2012			1
but the bickering on @entity123 misses an important point : the 2014 elections had the lowest turnout since @entity127 , meaning the issues and candidates that @entity2 ( and @entity84 ) put forward did n't stir the overwhelming majority of voters			1
at the same time , activists have enjoyed far greater success shaping issues and putting them on the public agenda : a track record @entity2 would do well to learn from			1
on september 21 , less than 60 days before the anemic - turnout election , more than 300,000 people marched in @entity44 , according to an estimate by the organizers -- and more than 2,600 events were staged in solidarity around the world -- to call attention to the perils of climate change			1
on december 4 , thousands of fast - food employees walked off the job in 190 cities across 35 states to demand better pay			0
and we have n't seen the end of nationwide civil rights demonstrations calling attention to controversial cases of police killing unarmed black boys and men			2
athletes , politicians , at least one police chief , as well as the president of @entity163 and dozens of congressional staff members have all made public displays of solidarity under the banner # @entity167			0
there 's no shortage of movements that have caught fire across the nation			0
if @entity2 want to get beyond this year 's low - turnout losses , they should get serious about understanding why politically active @entity21 seem to be choosing picket lines over polling sites -- and then tailor a message that can lead to victory in 2016 and beyond .			1

@entity181 says activists stage big *protests* but @entity2 leaders are n't listening
he says party suffered from very low turnout , lack of *enthusiasm* in recent elections
louis says @entity2 leaders should take their cue from climate , @entity197 *protesters*
