@entity0 -- @entity3 unions were making final preparations for a general strike thursday to protest the new conservative government 's labor reforms and austerity cuts			1
it will be the first general strike against the government of prime minister @entity11 , which was elected in november and took office in december , in the midst of @entity3 's deep economic crisis			1
leaders of the two main unions -- the @entity17 - leaning @entity16 ( @entity18 ) and the @entity20 - leaning @entity19 ( @entity19 ) -- were due in @entity0 's central @entity22 plaza late wednesday to meet with union picketers who will then spread out across the capital , while other picketers fan out across the nation			2
the unions are expected to try to disrupt public transportation and major industry in the early hours of the strike , either through workers staying off the job or through informational picketers who will noisily greet people trying to go to work and ask them to join the strike			1
the last general strike , in september 2010 , was against the then - @entity17 government , which also had initiated austerity measures			1
that strike slowed industry and transport , but much of the country went to work and many analysts saw it as a kind of a draw between the government and unions			1
since then , the economic crisis has deepened			0
@entity3 's jobless rate is nearly 23 % overall , and nearly 50 % for youth			1
nearly 5.3 million @entity3 are out of work			2
@entity16 protests across the nation this month and last drew large crowds , which analysts say emboldened the unions to move ahead with a general strike			1
the government says the latest labor reforms are needed to bring flexibility to the workplace and to simplify the rules for employers			0
but unions say the effect will be to make it easier and cheaper to fire workers			0
the unions ' strike theme is : " they want to end labor and social rights and finish off everything			2
" at the @entity83 wholesale fish market , one of the largest in @entity81 , seafood wholesaler @entity77 , who employs 120 people , said he does n't think striking is good			0
" it would be better if unions , the government and employers would negotiate and find a solution , " he said			0
@entity16 picketers are expected at the entrance to the sprawling market on @entity0 's south side , but some employees say they plan to work despite the strike			2
" if the boss buys fish and we need to come , we 'll come , " said @entity96 , a worker at the wholesale market			0
" but if the union pickets outside wo n't let us in , we 'll just have to wait , or maybe go home			0
" many other @entity3 , who have already seen their salaries cut or frozen in the economic crisis , were debating whether to strike			2
if they walk out , they will lose a day 's wage , which for government workers could amount to several hundred dollars			0
unions and government officials in many , but not all , of @entity3 's 17 regions have agreed on minimum services , which generally call for about 30 % of public transportation to run , while public hospitals and other essential services would have reduced staff , similar to holiday levels			1
the unions also plan 80 demonstrations across the country on thursday , mostly in the late afternoon or eary evening			2
the strike comes one day before the government unveils its 2012 budget on friday , with the aim of reducing @entity3 's deficit to 5.3 % of gross domestic product this year , and to 3 % next year , to meet @entity126 requirements			1
the government already approved a $ 20 billion ( 15 billion euro ) package of austerity cuts and tax hikes to reduce the deficit , and on friday it is expected to announce a second package of the same size or larger			0
government critics say it will be the first time the government really shows its hand on where to make deep cuts in specific programs and agencies			0
@entity11 , at a recent @entity126 summit , was reported by @entity3 media to be overheard on an open microphone telling another @entity126 leader that the labor reforms would cost him a general strike			1
the reforms were approved first as a decree law , with immediate effect , and the unions called on the government to make amendments as the bill moved through parliament			1
but the conservatives have a commanding majority in parliament and later approved the reforms unchanged			0
the government says the labor reforms make up only a portion of the elements needed to spur an economic recovery			0
it predicts a 1.7 % decline in the economy this year			0
the government also has demanded reforms in the banking sector , with the aim of getting credit flowing again and to clean up the books of lenders stuck with huge uncollectible debts left over from @entity3 's real estate and construction boom that went bust , precipitating the economic crisis .			1
