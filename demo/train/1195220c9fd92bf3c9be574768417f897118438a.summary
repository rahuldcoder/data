" and that is done by going out and participating in re-enactments			2
" when asked whether he thought the men being impersonated were " valiant men , " @entity11 said , " i do n't think we can sit here and judge that today			2

were there bad people ? absolutely			0
were there atrocities committed ? absolutely there were			0
there are people that want to deny the holocaust ever happened in this country and around the world			0
" the website for @entity11 's re-enactment group -- which impersonates members of the 5th @entity56 , @entity57 -- does not mention the @entity50 directly			1
