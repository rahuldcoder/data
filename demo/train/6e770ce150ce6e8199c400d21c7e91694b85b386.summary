-- @entity2 authorities are expected to announce friday that a " cold shutdown " has been achieved at the @entity4 nuclear power plant			1
that would mean the plant 's crippled reactors have stayed at temperatures below the boiling point for some time			1
the announcement is a symbolic milestone			1
but experts say it will take years -- perhaps decades -- to fully clean up the worst nuclear disaster since @entity16			1
the plume of radioactive particles that spewed from @entity4 -- where reactor cooling systems failed in the aftermath of @entity2 's devastating earthquake and tsunami in march -- displaced about 80,000 people who lived within a 20 - kilometer ( 12.5 - mile ) radius of the plant , as well as residents of one village as far as 40 kilometers to the northwest			1
the government has yet to determine when those evacuated can return to their homes			2
significant work -- with significant risks -- remains to be done at the plant			1
" this is far from over , and the work will go on for a long time , " @entity36 president @entity35 told @entity0 this week			1
citing government sources , @entity2 's @entity38 reported thursday that scrapping crippled reactors at the plant could take up to 40 years			1
in october , a spokesman for @entity36 -- which owns the plant -- said temperatures in the three reactors where meltdowns occurred had already been brought down below 100 degrees @entity47 ( 212 degrees @entity48 ) , but the company would have to maintain those conditions for some time before declaring the reactors in cold shutdown			1
" they 're making this out to be some big milestone , some big thing			2
but the reality of this is that it 's not , " said @entity57 , a former senior operator at @entity60 nuclear power plants			1
" the problem is , with these reactors and the condition that they 're in , to suggest that they 're in cold shutdown really does n't do justice to the situation			2
they 're no safer today than they were basically in june			2
" officials could start removing spent fuel rods from the facility next year , but it could be up to a decade before they are able to access the reactor vessels , he said			0
" they 'll probably spend two or three years studying it , " he said			2
@entity80 , who helped lead the cleanup of the @entity83 nuclear plant after the 1979 partial meltdown there , said the cold shutdown likely means officials may have one less thing to worry about			1
if they do n't have to use as much water to cool the reactors , they also do n't have to worry about what to do with contaminated cooling water -- one of many problems that have plagued workers at the crippled plant			1
" it 's not like there 's a dramatic difference			0
it 's just a gradual incremental difference that does make life easier , " he said			0
the earthquake and tsunami on march 11 killed more than 15,000 people in northeastern @entity2			2
the country was on edge for weeks as cooling systems failed and utility and government employees scrambled to prevent a nuclear catastrophe at the six - reactor @entity4 plant , located about 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity114			1
hydrogen explosions blew apart the no. 1 and no. 3 reactor housings , while another hydrogen blast is suspected to have damaged the no. 2 reactor			0
fires believed caused by heat from the no. 4 spent fuel pool damaged that unit 's reactor building			0
@entity2 's @entity125 eventually categorized the accident as a level - 7 event -- the highest level on an international scale for nuclear disasters -- putting it on par with the @entity16			1
" we are going to check each reactor properly and determine what is going to happen to those left , " @entity35 , the @entity36 president , said wednesday			0
removing spent fuel rods is the next step , but officials need to further survey the area before that happens , he said			0
" we are considering sending a robot into the fuel tanks to really have a good idea ( about ) the situation			0
this will be necessary when we take out the fuel , " @entity35 said			0
" but i do n't believe what we see will be 180 degrees different from our simulations			0
but as we say , seeing once is better than hearing 100 times , so we will have a good look at what 's happening inside			0
" at @entity83 , where damage was less severe and only one reactor was affected , it took two and half years before officials were able to get inside the reactor to assess it , @entity152 said			2
at @entity4 , that process will likely take much longer , he said			0
" i think in terms of what 's ahead , it 's still the daunting task that it 's always been , which is first of all , figuring out where everything is			0
... they 're going to be searching for and finding pieces of fuel , chunks of molten material that have now cooled , through all of that rubble , " he said			0
@entity0 's @entity174 and @entity175 in @entity176 , and @entity177 in @entity114 contributed to this report .			0

the announcement means temperatures have stayed below the boiling point
experts say significant work -- with significant risks -- remains to be done
