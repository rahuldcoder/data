-- recent headlines about contaminated foods , from peanut butter and salad to turkey and eggs , are enough to make even the most intrepid eater a little bit paranoid			0
but before you commit to a life of vitamins and astronaut ice cream , take comfort in the fact that you 'll likely be ok eating as you always have : " we have a very safe food system , " says @entity17 , executive director of the @entity18			2
there are only three foods so risky that you should avoid them altogether			0
here 's the red - light list : raw milk fans of raw milk ( meaning milk that has n't been pasteurized or homogenized ) credit it with having more beneficial bacteria and enzymes than its processed counterpart , but science has n't proven any of these claims			1
and raw milk can become contaminated in a number of ways : by coming into contact with cow feces or bacteria living on the skin of cows , from an infection of the cow 's udder , or from dirty equipment , among others			1
the special heating process we know as pasteurization is the only effective way of killing most , if not all , harmful bacteria -- which can include listeria , salmonella , and @entity54			1
@entity0 : 10 types of food that can make you sick according to the @entity59 ( @entity59 ) , there were 86 reported food poisoning outbreaks from raw milk between 1998 and 2008 , resulting in 1,676 illnesses , 191 hospitalizations , and two deaths			1
raw milk is responsible for nearly three times more hospitalizations than any other foodborne disease outbreak , says @entity67 , @entity68 , senior epidemiologist with the @entity59 's @entity69			1
it 's no wonder selling raw milk to consumers is illegal in about half of @entity74 states			1
" we have two people , in @entity80 and @entity81 , who developed @entity84 © syndrome [ which can cause paralysis and respiratory failure ] after contracting a bacterial infection called campylobacteriosis from drinking raw milk , " says @entity75 , head of dairy safety at the @entity77 ( @entity77 )			1
" these were healthy , active people who came down with debilitating , lifelong diseases			0
" @entity0 : how to practice food safety in your home kitchen raw sprouts when sprouts were identified as the culprit in the food poisoning outbreak that killed at least 50 people in @entity100 this past summer , you probably wondered : what could be so bad about innocent , vegan - friendly sprouts ? but food - safety experts were n't surprised			2
according to the @entity59 , there have been at least 30 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness in the @entity74 from raw or lightly cooked sprouts since 1996			1
all types of sprouts -- from the alfalfas you get on a sandwich to the mung bean sprouts garnishing your @entity114 food -- can be dangerous when not thoroughly cooked			0
this is largely because of how they 're grown , explains @entity118 , @entity68 , senior policy analyst at the @entity77 : the warm , moist environment necessary for growing sprouts provides the perfect conditions for bacteria ( such as salmonella or @entity54 ) to multiply			2
@entity0 : how can you tell if food poisoning is harmless , or life - threatening ? ask for restaurant and take - out meals to be sprout - free , since you ca n't know how well they 've been cooked			0
and if you just ca n't live without sprouts , try getting used to giving them a hot bath before you eat them : research has shown that you can kill salmonella by immersing contaminated sprouts in boiling water for five seconds			0
raw oysters from the @entity139 everyone knows that eating raw shellfish can be dicey ( and in fact the @entity59 advises against it entirely ) , but bivalves from the @entity139 take it to a whole new level			1
waters in the @entity139 are warmer than those in the @entity149 and other popular oystering spots , making it possible for a bacterium called @entity153 vulnificus to thrive			2
" oysters are filter feeders , which means they concentrate any contaminants in the water , " explains @entity155 , @entity68 , a senior epidemiologist at the @entity156			0
" a number of toxins can get into an oyster , but none are remotely as bad as @entity153 vulnificus			0
" @entity0 : 10 states where rare and exotic diseases lurk healthy people who ingest a @entity171 vulnificus -- ridden oyster might have vomiting , diarrhea , and abdominal pain , but for anyone with a compromised immune system , the bug can infiltrate the bloodstream , causing a severe and life - threatening illness called septicemia , which is fatal in one - third of cases			0
and while having a pre-existing medical condition puts you at particular risk , " anyone at all can get horrifically sick , " @entity155 says			0
the good news is that several big seafood purchasers , like @entity188 and @entity189 , require that @entity139 oysters be pasteurized before being served , as does the state of @entity80 -- so in these places the risk is far lower			2
pasteurized or not , " the simplest tactic here is to avoid raw @entity139 oysters altogether , " says @entity193 , staff attorney at the @entity194			1
that can go a long way toward keeping you safer			0

pasteurization is the only effective way of killing harmful bacteria in milk
there have been 30 reported outbreaks of foodborne illness from sprouts
eating raw shellfish from the @entity139 is particularly dicey
