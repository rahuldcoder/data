like anyone with an @entity4 account , i 've been captivated in recent weeks by the insane - and - pioneering efforts of two men attempting to free climb a vertical rock face at @entity8			1
on wednesday , the climbers , @entity10 and @entity11 , became the first people in the world to free climb the " @entity17 " route of @entity8 's @entity16 face			1
it 's a path marked by " pebble - size holds , " according to the @entity20 , so sharp they 'll make your fingers bleed			1
like , literally will make your fingers bleed			0
check out this photo from @entity10 's @entity4 account			1
he reportedly sanded and super-glued the ends of his fingers to try to make them strong enough to grip the nearly sheer face of rock			1
it 's one of the hardest climbing routes in the world			1
which is why @entity10 and @entity11 , who started the journey on december 27 , and who slept in tents tacked to the vertical face , could be forgiven for thinking that they " conquered " this route , or this mountain			1
but , thankfully , that 's not how they see it			1
here 's what @entity10 had to say on @entity48 : it 's about " realizing a dream			1
being struck by the awesomeness of nature , as it 's clear the pair often were , based on their social media posts			1
but certainly not about " conquering " it			0
that 's a refreshing opinion in the age of fracking and mountain - top removal			1
we live in a culture that tends to nature as a thing to be subverted and used , not respected			2
@entity10 and @entity11 's epic ascent of the @entity17 should be a reminder of how small we humans are in the face of the natural world -- and also of how much we tiny humans can accomplish with enough hard work			1
the problem is that most of our efforts are misplaced			0
rather than seeking to understand and explore the many uncharted parts of the world -- the 95 % of the ocean that is unseen by humans , for example -- we extract capital			2
we drill deeper wells into the ground , sucking out water at such an unsustainable rate that @entity87 's @entity86 is sinking			2
elsewhere , we inject wastewater into the land as part of the process of pulling out oil and natural gas			0
these injections , according to the @entity94 , contribute to earthquakes in odd places like @entity98			0
we 've turned farms into factories			0
animals are bigger - fatter - tastier products , not living things			0
or , worse , they 're status symbols , as in illegal rhino horn or pangolin meat			0
the drop in the price of oil has slowed some efforts to go after the hardest - to - get energy sources , like oil hidden below the ocean floor , and underneath more than a mile of water			0
but it has n't changed this ethic -- this core belief , which you can link back to the @entity119 if you wish , that humans have " dominion " over the world , that it 's ours to rule and / or plunder as we choose			1
there are , however , signs this mindset is changing			0
new theories suggest we can and should live in partnership with the natural world -- removing dams from rivers , and letting them run free into the flood plain ; harnessing energy from the wind , not from deep beneath the ocean			2
the @entity141 documentary " @entity140 " gives a sense of this seismic shift			0
the @entity8 climbers offer hope , as well			2
" free climbs are puzzles , " wrote @entity145 for @entity146			0
" the harder the movements get -- twisting , stretching , lunging , swinging , dangling -- the more painstaking the process of solving the puzzle becomes			0
" the world is a puzzle to be solved -- an adventure to be had			2
the rest of us would benefit from seeing it that way , too .			0

rock climbers complete one of the world 's most difficult routes
climber on @entity48 : we did n't " conquer " the mountain
@entity170 says that 's a *healthy* way to look at nature
