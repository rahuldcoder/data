-- it 's the biggest stage in the world of college football			1
the talented students from @entity5 and @entity6 who charge onto the field monday night in @entity8 , @entity9 , will know that nothing in their lives may ever top this feeling			1
for the great majority of the seniors who wo n't go on to play professionally , this will be the last time in uniform			1
i 'm not referring to the football players			2
the @entity19 and the @entity20 will be competing for the national championship , and their head coaches , @entity23 and @entity24 , have been getting them ready for the game			1
but there are two other groups of students from those schools who also will step onto the bright green floor of the @entity32 on monday night			2
those squads are even larger in number than the football teams , and , although they draw considerably less national attention , they have been preparing just as diligently			1
" it starts with practices in the heat of the @entity46 summer , " said @entity38 , associate professor of music at @entity6 and director of the 380 - member @entity41			1
" just like the football players , our musicians are at the very peak of their abilities , " said @entity47 , professor of music at @entity5 and director of bands , including the 400 - member @entity50			1
with kickoff approaching , i got in touch with @entity59 and @entity47 because the months of work put in by marching band members at schools across the country often gets overlooked			1
they are a major part of the pageantry of college football , but in recent decades the television networks have all but ignored them most of the time			1
if the performance of the marching bands at college games each saturday gets a few seconds on the tv broadcasts , they count themselves lucky			1
" generally , if we do get airtime , it 's very brief , minimal , " said @entity6 's @entity38			1
" we 'd love to be able to share what we do with more people			0
" @entity5 's @entity47 said : " the kids in the band do n't know any different			1
i grew up in a world where the halftime shows were seen on tv , but that 's over			1
" the replacements on television have been studio shows with analysis , replays and highlights of other games ; the studio shows are lucrative revenue generators , attractive for commercial sponsors , and the switch away from the field at halftime is almost instant on most telecasts			2
still , the audiences inside the stadiums are massive			0
@entity5 's home stadium seats more than 82,000 ; @entity6 's seats more than 87,000			1
the @entity32 , where monday 's national championship game will be played , seats more than 90,000			1
few bands of any kind ever get to play in front of that many people			2
@entity110 and the @entity111 might even be a bit envious			0
the musicians , although they do their work on the same gridirons as the football players , are not recognized around campus the way the star quarterbacks or linebackers are			1
" with 380 musicians in the band , not many people can pick out their faces , " @entity38 said			0
and as far as the scholarships and perks that go with big - time college football programs : forget it			1
at @entity5 , @entity47 said , not only are there no marching band scholarships , but " the student musicians pay for the work they do -- the band is a one - credit class , so they 're paying tuition to be in it			1
we 're kind of proud that the members of the band are there by choice			0
" at @entity6 , @entity38 said , the budget that is available for the marching band 's expenses goes only so far ; the university provides the band 's uniforms , " but the members of the band have to pay for the cleaning , " and they have to get their uniforms to the laundry after the games			1
the intangible rewards , however , are ample			0
" the individual challenge is to play the instruments as well as they can , to lock into the formations as well as they can , " @entity47 said			0
" the big picture is when they look at the crowd , see the fans clapping , watch the football team waving at them			2
the feeling is being a part of something huge			0
" @entity38 said the friendship and the time together is something irreplaceable , something the band members will take with them for the rest of their lives			0
very few members of the marching bands go on to careers as professional musicians			1
" some will go on to teach music , " @entity38 said , " but for most , they bless us with their talent while they 're here , and then they graduate and do something else for a living			0
" @entity47 said : " i hope that , in 10 years , some who are in the band now will still play their instruments in church , or in a community musical group			0
" the physical challenges can be daunting : " we come onto the field in a high - step jog , with legs all the way up , " @entity38 said			2
" they 're wearing long - sleeved cadet - style uniforms , heavy hats , and carrying their instruments , and for a 1 o'clock game in @entity46 , it can be 98 degrees down on the field			2
" @entity47 and @entity59 both said that , each year , there are some musicians who are supremely talented , but who just ca n't play their instruments well while marching quickly in formation			2
there also are some who are brilliant at close - order drills , but whose musicianship does not match their strutting skills			0
the directors have to tell them that they have n't made it onto the bands			2
with hundreds of band members on the field , if one musician hits a clunky note or takes a false step , the football fans up in the seats may not notice			2
but the other band members do , as do the band directors			0
" we 're all attuned to it , and we know , " @entity47 said			0
" the accuracy of the notes , the formations to lock into , the crescendos -- we know right away when something 's off			0
" @entity38 said : " our standards for ourselves are high			0
we teach a precise work ethic , a pride , that we hope will carry over to whatever the musicians do after they leave here			0
" as the seniors in both schools ' bands , like the seniors on both schools ' football teams , soon will do			1
but first there is monday night 's game			1
each band has been allocated six minutes to perform before kickoff , when , as they march , they will play their schools ' traditional fight songs			0
at halftime , each band gets eight minutes ; among @entity6 's selections , @entity38 said , will be music from stage shows that became popular movies			1
@entity47 said that the @entity5 band will also include movie music : the @entity248 theme , among other songs			2
and then , for the musicians whose final season this is , it will be over			0
" the value of all this will become more apparent to them as the years go on , " @entity47 said			0
@entity38 said that when graduating band members tell him that being on the squad has been the time of their lives , he tells them he hopes that turns out not to be true			0
" i thank them , but i tell them that i do n't really want that for them			0
i tell them that i hope they will have many , many special moments after they leave college			0
i tell them that i hope the times of their lives -- the spine - chilling , best moments -- are still ahead of them			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity276 .			2

two other teams will take the field at monday 's college football championship game
@entity276 writes that it 's a big evening for the @entity6 , @entity5 marching bands
@entity276 : they likely wo n't be featured on tv , but their hard work *deserves* praise
