-- as coach of @entity4 's national women 's football team , @entity1 is credited with changing attitudes to the sport			1
but to @entity8 football is more than a game -- it 's a way to help society and improve the lives of girls around her country			1
" i 'm the type of coach at this point of time that is more willing to support social change and build and contribute towards nation building and reconciliation , instead of just the end result of what is happening on the pitch , " she says			1
@entity1 recently launched a six - team women 's super league in a bid to increase the pool and quality of players available for @entity4 's national squad -- but that is not her only goal			1
" for the players themselves , it keeps them off the street , it keeps them busy , " she says			0
" we 've had a lot of teenage pregnancies in the past and nowadays girls are thinking of postponing that because there 's a league coming			0
" we will be touring to the other regions , to the other towns , but all in all it 's about exposing their skills and showing their abilities in what they can do			0
" for @entity62 , coaching the national side of a country with a history of racial segregation and a present dominated by struggles against poverty and @entity61 comes with additional responsibilities			0
" we are a nation currently ranked top in the world with regard to the hiv infection rate and we have seen a decrease in terms of teenage pregnancy of all the girls that are part of all the leagues that are part of our programs , " says @entity1			2
" we have seen how parents are also coming out on different days that we are launching for @entity67 and @entity61 testing and this is obviously very important for our country , " she adds			0
" that 's why we have seen big organizations such as @entity83 investing in girls ' football ... in order to raise awareness regarding social change			1
" initiatives like " @entity90 , " sponsored by @entity83 , aim to use football as a platform to raise awareness of health and social responsibility in @entity4			2
women 's football might be contributing to society now , but 35 - year - old @entity1 remembers that things were very different when she was growing up in the southern @entity100 country " a girl could n't play football , not even participate in sports , " she recalls			1
" just running , normal jogging , was regarded as taboo			0
" although football has always been part of life in @entity4 , for years it was culturally unacceptable for girls to participate in the sport			1
those perceptions failed to deter @entity113 from following her passion for the game			0
@entity113 's football journey began some two decades ago , playing with the boys of her neighborhood despite the disapproval of her family and community			2
" girls were not encouraged to participate in sport because there were all these different type of myths : you 're not going to be fertile , you 're not going to get married one day , you 're not going to have the so - called happy ending that would make any mother proud , " @entity113 says			0
unfazed by the difficulties , she continued to play her favorite sport during her college years , when she started making a name for herself			2
word of her talent quickly spread and when a women 's national football squad was formed in the early 2000s she was called up			1
in 2006 she was made national coach and soon caught the eye of football governing body @entity140 , which appointed her an international coaching instructor in 2008			0
@entity113 , who 's also a member of @entity140 's world cup technical study group , says that women 's football is today the number one female sport in @entity4			1
despite that , @entity4 is ranked 114th in the world and has only recently started investing in grooming young talent			0
but while the country struggles to compete on the international stage , @entity1 says the success of projects like " @entity90 " is having a positive impact on communities and is boosting the self esteem of the young girls participating			2
" the girls are getting the necessary respect in the community because everyone is asking them : are you also part of the football team ? ' " she says			1
" they are seen as role models within the communities and i think it 's really awesome			0
