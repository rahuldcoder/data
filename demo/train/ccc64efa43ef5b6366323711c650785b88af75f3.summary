@entity0 -- chanting " they do n't represent us , " tens of thousands in @entity0 railed early sunday against @entity6 's government and austerity cuts -- venting their anger on the first anniversary of the so - called may 15 protest movement			1
the government earlier had given a 10 p.m. ( 4 p.m. et ) saturday deadline for the crowd in the central @entity14 plaza to disperse			1
yet while their numbers appeared to thin somewhat by early sunday , they remained a loud and vibrant presence in the square -- as a large number of police , stationed at a nearby government building and along side streets , looked on and let them be			0
throngs of like - minded demonstrators also gathered over the weekend in @entity26 and about 80 other cities around @entity6			1
the coordinated events marked the return of the " indignados " -- or the outraged , as the protesters became known -- who led @entity34 's first serious and significant anti-cuts and anti-austerity grassroots movement			2
similar demonstrations decrying governments ' attempts to get their budgets in order , sometimes by slashing public funding , later emerged elsewhere around @entity34			0
in @entity0 this weekend , marchers from the north , south , east and west descended on @entity14 plaza on saturday evening			1
for hours , demonstrators shouted , jumped , sang and waved white handkerchiefs			0
their most dramatic moment , though , may have been their quietest : when they held their hands aloft , silently , in a " silent shout " before erupting in cheers			1
if and when the crowd dissipates early sunday , they are expected to return			0
the government has ok 'd three more days of protests in @entity0 , meaning similar scenes could play out into the middle of the week			1
the number of demonstrators evident in @entity0 over the weekend were strong , though they appeared to be slightly fewer than those who had gathered in the same spot -- in what 's known as ground zero of the movement -- a year earlier			1
back then , protesters encamped in @entity0 and other cities made their voices heard			2
the tens of thousands of people who turned out in the initial days grew to an estimated 6 million protesters over the following months , in a nation of 46 million people			2
since then , occupy camps around the world have come and gone			0
the new protests organized by the may 15 movement are different in at least one key respect : a new conservative government is now in control , having taken over in december			1
@entity6 's economic crisis also has worsened since last year			2
the nation has slipped back into a recession , the unemployment rate has risen to 24 % overall and more than 50 % for those under age 25 , and the government has enacted billions of dollars in austerity cuts , along with some tax hikes , to reduce the budget deficit			2
" we are really tired of this situation , " said @entity0 protester @entity91 , a purchasing agent			0
" and the new government is the same			0
they steal our money and give it to the banks			0
" @entity6 's austerity protests have been largely peaceful to date , with only occasional clashes between protesters and police , and some arrests in cities like @entity26 and @entity104			1
and prior the latest protests , the new government -- which has vowed to maintain order and prevent a repetition of encampments in @entity0 and beyond -- urged police commanders to use " common sense " as to how they dealt with the latest round of public dissent			1
in recent months , @entity6 trade unions , traditionally the protest leaders , have been at the forefront of demonstrations against the austerity cuts and labor market reforms , with the may 15 movement barely visible			1
" maybe the most important thing is it awakened a consciousness , beyond concrete changes , to make historic change possible , " said @entity120 , who was a movement spokesman a year ago but now spends more time on his architectural cooperative for urban planning			0
" i think everyone who took part in the may 15 movement made history			1
they can take away from us many things , but not our memory and our dream , " @entity120 said			0
the original may 15 movement is credited with helping stop dozens of housing evictions			1
activists pressured bank and court officials to delay or stop foreclosures on delinquent mortgages			0
but @entity145 , a sociologist who has studied the movement for the left - leaning @entity147 , said there has been little big - picture change as to government policies and operations			0
" the demonstrations did n't do more than expose -- for a brief time -- some issues			0
but @entity6 's economic crisis and political system have not changed			2
they are the same as last year , " he said .			0

new : thousands in @entity0 's @entity14 plaza do a " silent shout " to protest cuts
new : " the new government is the same , " a woman says , claiming people are fed up
similar rallies are held in @entity26 and other cities around @entity6
the protests *coincide* with the anniversary of the *launch* of the may 15 movement
