last week , millions of @entity0 stood up against the @entity1 and the @entity3 's related anti-piracy bill			2
given the public outcry , it is not surprising that all four @entity7 presidential candidates have come out against them			0
but online censorship in the name of fighting piracy is only one of many issues affecting @entity0 ' digital freedom			2
@entity0 who care about their online freedoms should also be asking tough questions about the government 's expanding surveillance powers			1
as we grow increasingly dependent on the @entity23 and cell phones for all aspects of our lives , government abuse of citizens ' privacy requires the cooperation of the private sector			1
this includes companies running our @entity23 and wireless service providers , e-mail , and social networking services , as well as manufacturers of the devices we use to connect			2
@entity40 's announcement earlier this week that it will integrate user information across its search engine , @entity36 , @entity37 and its 57 other services stirred criticism from privacy groups and some members of @entity46			1
people have good reason to be unhappy about losing control over who and what services know what about them			0
but that is far from the only way in which we are losing control			0
under two successive administrations , new laws , policies and corporate practices have made it much easier for government agencies to track and access citizens ' private digital communications from their storage " in the cloud " than it is for agents to search or monitor our physical homes , offices , vehicles , and mail			1
the erosion of privacy rights under the @entity75 , written to protect us against unreasonable search and seizure , began in earnest under president @entity80			1
the @entity81 , passed overwhelmingly but hastily after 9/11 , allows the @entity82 to obtain telecommunication , financial , and credit records without a court order			1
moreover , the @entity87 's 2008 amendment act grants @entity0 companies immunity from being sued by their customers when they comply even with blatantly illegal government surveillance requests			1
as a presidential candidate in 2008 , @entity92 pledged to reform the @entity81 and rescind the @entity94 , but as president he reversed his position			0
the @entity92 administration has fought bipartisan efforts in @entity46 to bring the change he once championed			0
the result is the " new normal " : surveillance , often of questionable legality and sometimes clear illegality , against which @entity0 have little effective recourse , on the rare occasions that we even know that violations are taking place			2
most of what we do know is thanks to whistle - blowers , activists , academics and a few committed journalists			0
in 2004 , @entity118 , a technician who had just retired from @entity119 , disclosed that in 2003 the @entity120 built a secret room at the @entity123 facility where he worked , routing all e-mail and phone traffic through it			0
another whistle - blower , @entity128 attorney @entity127 , confirmed that similar interception points were set up around the country to gather and analyze the e-mails and phone calls of @entity0 who were not suspected of any crime			0
while the federal government is required by law to document publicly its wiretapping of phone lines , it is not required to do so with @entity23 communications			1
over 50,000 @entity141 , a kind of administrative demand letter requiring no probable cause or judicial oversight , are issued each year			0
yet we know few details			0
companies complying with these secret letters were barred from even informing customers about them until 2009 when @entity152 , an entrepreneur who ran a small @entity154 - based internet service company , successfully enlisted the help of the @entity156 in challenging a blanket gag provision of the @entity81			2
last year , the @entity158 published a report analyzing the @entity82 's use of @entity141 from 2001 to 2008 , concluding that the @entity82 might have violated the law as many as 40,000 times during that period			1
in many cases the companies involved -- including phone companies , internet service providers , financial institutions , and credit agencies -- " contributed in some way to the @entity82 's unauthorized receipt of personal information			1
" in the internet age , it is inevitable that corporations and government agencies will have access to detailed information about people 's lives			1
we willingly share personal information with companies for the convenience of using their products			2
we accept that a certain amount of surveillance is necessary in order to protect innocent people from crime and terror			1
but as a nation we have failed to address the resulting dilemma : how do we prevent the abuse of the power we have willingly delegated to government and companies ? if anything is clear from the political arguments raging throughout the country , it is that @entity0 worry , with good reason , about manipulation and abuse by both the private and the public sector			2
the @entity7 primary field is not unified on how to handle surveillance : @entity210 and @entity211 advocate expanding the @entity81 's surveillance powers			1
in @entity46 , debates about surveillance cross party lines			2
the @entity81 and @entity94 have staunch supporters as well as fierce opponents among @entity7 , @entity218 , and independents			0
the @entity220 of 2011 , which exempts companies from liability for sharing data with the government , is one of several bills introduced in @entity46 last year that civil liberties groups -- and in this case even the @entity229 -- warn will lead to further erosion of consumer privacy			1
the advent of the @entity23 does not change a bedrock truth upon which our nation was founded : the survival of @entity0 democracy depends as much on the defense of liberty as it does on the defense of our physical security			0
those two ideals always have been and always will be in tension ; but without a healthy balance between them -- online as well as offline -- we can not live free of fear			0
fortunately , the @entity248 takes our @entity75 rights seriously -- even when the executive and legislative branches of our government fail to do so -- as demonstrated by monday 's unanimous ruling that these rights were violated when police secretly planted gps devices on a suspect 's vehicle without a court order			1
rather than waiting for the @entity248 to reverse bad law and unconstitutional law enforcement , however , @entity0 can exercise their power through the ballot box to prevent violations from happening in the first place			0
in 2012 , the @entity0 people rightly expect presidential and congressional candidates to explain how they plan to protect us from crime and terror			0
in the internet age , that inevitably requires some degree of surveillance			0
yet it is equally vital we demand a clear vision of how they will protect us from abuses of government surveillance power through the corporate - run digital platforms upon which we are increasingly dependent			1
join the conversation on @entity284 .			0

@entity286 : government 's surveillance powers have expanded
she says government and companies can spy on our digital communications
@entity82 can get records without court orders , she writes ; companies ca *n't* be sued
we need to protect our security , she says , but also defend our privacy rights
