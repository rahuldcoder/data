@entity0 -- attorney general @entity2 , a longtime target of @entity4 who have tried to force him out of office , now faces the prospect of angering liberal supporters when the @entity9 decides whether to file federal charges in the @entity12 killing			1
civil rights groups are planning nationwide vigils , and more than a million people support an online petition drive calling for admitted shooter @entity17 to face federal charges in the february 2012 killing			2
@entity2 confronted that political pressure tuesday in a speech to the @entity23 , which is conducting the petition drive			1
he repeated his pledge for a full investigation of @entity12 's death in the aftermath of @entity17 's acquittal on murder and manslaughter charges by a @entity33 court , saying the @entity9 " will continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law			1
we will not be afraid			2
" but he was careful to avoid any promise or hint of federal charges			2
instead , @entity2 took aim at " stand your ground " laws like the one in @entity33 that have expanded the right to respond with deadly force if attacked outside the home			1
those laws " try to fix something that was never broken " and " senselessly expand the concept of self - defense and sow dangerous conflict in our neighborhoods , " he said			1
" by allowing -- and perhaps encouraging -- violent situations to escalate in public , such laws undermine public safety , " @entity2 said in his first public comment on legislation that more than 30 states have passed in some form			1
despite outrage , federal charges uncertain in @entity17 case " we must stand our ground to ensure that our laws reduce violence and take a hard look at laws that contribute to more violence than they prevent , " he added			1
@entity17 's lawyers did n't invoke @entity33 's " stand your ground " law in court , but it was included in the instructions to the jury that acquitted him			1
@entity33 gov. @entity85 's office reaffirmed his support for the law tuesday afternoon , saying a task force set up by his office reviewed the statute after @entity12 's death			1
" the task force recommended that the law should not be overturned , and governor @entity85 agrees , " @entity85 spokeswoman @entity92 said in a written statement			1
@entity95 , executive director of the @entity97 's @entity96 , similarly disagreed with @entity2			1
" the attorney general fails to understand that self - defense is not a concept , it 's a fundamental human right , " he said in a statement			1
" to send a message that legitimate self - defense is to blame is unconscionable , and demonstrates once again that this administration will exploit tragedies to push their political agenda			1
" @entity107 says he 'll boycott ' stand your ground ' states @entity2 's focus tuesday on a broader legal issue avoided the difficult decision he faces over whether to bring federal criminal charges			1
legal experts say federal charges against @entity17 are unlikely			2
because @entity17 is a private citizen , he can only be charged with a hate crime in terms of civil rights violations under federal law , said @entity121 , a former federal prosecutor in @entity33 who now is in private practice			1
to successfully prosecute @entity17 , the @entity9 would have to show that @entity17 " caused the death of @entity12 solely motivated by / because of his race or color , " @entity121 told @entity1 in an e-mail			0
" this element was absent from the state trial and quite frankly does n't exist			0
" verdict does n't end debate in @entity12 death @entity1 legal analyst @entity132 agreed monday that federal prosecutors are " in sort of a tough spot			2
" the hate crimes statute is generally applied to cases involving police officers or other government agents , @entity132 said , adding that using it in a case involving a lone private citizen is " very , very rare and i think in this case , it 's going to be very hard to prove			0
" sources told @entity1 monday that @entity9 officials were reviewing trial evidence to determine if such a case was winnable			0
the sources made clear that @entity2 's department would only file charges if officials believe they can secure a conviction			1
if @entity2 decides not to bring a federal case against @entity17 , he will disappoint liberal supporters who contend the @entity12 killing was a civil rights violation			1
the nation 's first @entity158 attorney general has been popular with the political left for his support of gay marriage and challenges to @entity4 efforts to change voting laws			1
at the same time , his policies have made him a political lightning rod for conservatives			2
@entity2 was censured last year by the @entity4 - led @entity169 over complaints that he failed to fully cooperate with a congressional investigation of the botched " @entity173 " gun - walking operation			1
he called the episode a politically motivated effort to discredit him			0
5 things about the controversy surrounding @entity2 last year , @entity2 himself raised questions about possible federal charges against @entity17 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , who killed @entity12 during an altercation as the unarmed teenager was walking in the community			1
" for a federal hate crime , we have to prove the highest standard in the law , " @entity2 said in april 2012 , 45 days after @entity17 shot @entity12 in what was depicted by civil rights groups as a racially motivated killing			1
in words that now sound prescient , @entity2 described to reporters that day how " something that was reckless , that was negligent does not meet that standard			1
" " we have to show that there was specific intent to do the crime with requisite state of mind , " he said			0
@entity17 's acquittal on saturday showed the @entity33 jury rejected that he intended to kill @entity12 for any reason , including the racial motivation necessary for federal charges that he violated @entity12 's civil rights			1
in a speech in @entity0 on monday , @entity2 said the @entity9 would " continue to act in a manner that is consistent with the facts and the law " in examining what he called " the tragic , unnecessary shooting death of @entity12			1
" " independent of the legal determination that will be made , i believe that this tragedy provides yet another opportunity for our nation to speak honestly about the complicated and emotionally charged issues that this case has raised , " @entity2 said			1
" we must not -- as we have too often in the past -- let this opportunity pass			0
" @entity17 was ' justified ' in shooting @entity12 , juror says separately , the @entity169 said president @entity220 would play no role in deciding whether federal charges are filed			2
" cases are brought on the merits and the merits are evaluated by the professionals at the @entity9 , " @entity169 spokesman @entity223 told reporters			0
the president on sunday called @entity12 's killing a tragedy for @entity231 , but said in a written statement that the jury had spoken			0
he acknowledged the case had " elicited strong passions , " but urged " calm reflection " in its aftermath			0
still , political pressure for a federal case is mounting			2
on tuesday , the rev. @entity240 and other civil rights leaders gathered outside the @entity9 to announce scores of " @entity246 " vigils outside of federal buildings across the country this weekend			2
" people all over the country will gather to show that we are not having a two - or three - day anger fit , " @entity240 said			2
" this is a social movement for justice			0
" he also called for a full federal investigation of the @entity12 killing , saying mere remarks by @entity220 and others were n't enough			2
" the president has made a statement of consolation , " @entity240 said			0
" we do n't need consolation			0
we need legislation and we need some federal prosecution			2
" watch @entity2 's speech those seeking federal charges say the killing was racially motivated , arguing that @entity17 , a neighborhood watch volunteer , targeted @entity12 for special scrutiny because the teenager was an @entity158			1
regardless of how the shooting occurred , they say , the fight occurred because of @entity12 's race			0
" the most fundamental of civil rights -- the right to life -- was violated the night @entity17 stalked and then took the life of @entity12 , " says the petition on the @entity23 website			0
five reasons for acquittal rep. @entity283 , the @entity285 @entity284 who chairs the @entity286 , said racial profiling like what @entity17 did to @entity12 " continues to make communities of innocent individuals fear a justice system designed to protect them			0
" " men and women wonder if merely walking or driving justifies being followed , stopped , or questioned , " @entity293 said in a statement monday			0
" this practice and the presumption of guilt so often associated with people of color must come to an end			0
" petition to @entity169 such political pressure evokes memories of the @entity308 case in 1991 , when videotape of white @entity311 police officers clubbing an @entity158 man after a car chase prompted race - tinged national furor			2
when a criminal court failed to convict the officers of police brutality , riots ensued in @entity311 over alleged racial discrimination			0
the @entity9 then filed a civil rights suit against the officers , alleging " deprivations of federal rights under color of law , " and two of them were convicted in 1993			2
a court sentenced them to 30 months in federal prison			0
@entity121 said the @entity9 ca n't file similar charges against @entity17 because he is a private citizen instead of a police officer or government official of any kind			0
" there are no other relevant sections under which to prosecute him " other than the hate crime statute , which covers " offenses involving actual or perceived race , color , religion , or national origin , " @entity121 added			0
a federal hate crimes violation in a killing carries a maximum penalty of life in prison			0
even if the federal charges were identical to the state charges , it would not be double jeopardy for @entity17 because the federal government is a separate and sovereign entity			0
@entity12 's family can still file a civil wrongful death lawsuit against @entity17 to seek penalties and damages			0
such a legal move carries no criminal penalty or prison time			0
@entity220 wo n't get involved in decision @entity1 's @entity362 , @entity363 and @entity364 contributed to this report .			0
