-- i signed up to volunteer for a one - way trip to @entity3			1
yep , one - way			2
@entity6 , a @entity7 nonprofit organization , aims to establish the first human settlement on @entity3 in the coming decades			1
i am one of 1,058 people chosen from around the world to be in round two of @entity6 's astronaut application pool			1
the next few rounds will narrow the field until at last 24 candidates will be picked to begin 10 years of training for the mission			0
the process is very competitive			0
in my application , i highlighted my strengths , including adaptability , resiliency , curiosity and leadership skills			0
i am ready to accept all the hard challenges of going to space and living on @entity3			1
my passion for @entity3 and space exploration began in 1997 when i was 8 years old			1
@entity29 had been sending humans to space for several decades , but it began to push new frontiers by sending the first rover to @entity3			1
the sojourner rover landed on the @entity3 on july 4 , 1997 , and gave humans a glimpse of the rust - colored martian surface			1
seeing the images ignited a passion inside			0
for most people , perhaps the desolate landscape of @entity3 is uninviting ; for me , it was the future -- the next frontier			1
i remember telling myself then that the only way we will find the answers locked inside our solar system would be to send humans to @entity3 ; and i wanted to go			1
when i was a senior in college , i was selected to be the executive officer and chief geologist of crew 99 at the @entity51 in @entity52			0
much like the astronauts on the @entity56 learn to live and work in space , the @entity54 's @entity51 outpost teaches us how to live , work and solve problems on @entity3			1
my crew consisted of five other students from across the country and we lived at a @entity3 analogue station for two weeks			1
we learned how to conduct daily missions , maintain our habitat , take quick showers and utilize recycled water systems			0
although our two - week stay is relatively short compared to @entity6 's lifelong expedition , it is scientific research like this that is going to help us find a way to adapt to living on other planets			1
once the @entity6 crew arrives on @entity3 the members will begin living their lives as @entity81			1
a majority of their time will be spent conducting scientific experiments , exploring the surroundings , maintaining and improving their habitat			0
they will also stay connected with the world they left through e-mail and video messages			0
they will live like the scientists at @entity51 and spend their days learning how to adapt to a foreign environment			0
the opportunity the @entity6 project presents is extraordinary			2
humans have always dreamed of living on another planet			2
the technology to send us to the surface of a planet like @entity3 exists ; it has been available for more than 20 years			1
but limited funding and unknown health risks have put a brake on our desire to try to settle on other planets			0
200,000 apply to live on @entity3 because @entity3 mysteriously lost its atmosphere and oceans millions of years ago it is important for us to find out why			2
by sending humans there , we can find answers to @entity3 ' past and future , and ultimately , maybe find answers to the future of @entity119			2
of course , there are concerns about whether it makes sense to start a human settlement on such a cold and harsh planet			1
in an article in @entity129 , astronauts and physicians acknowledge that the human body is n't equipped for long - term space travel			2
risks include extended exposure to radiation and cosmic rays			0
even at low and acceptable levels , they may cause health problems			0
luckily , it does not take a lifetime to travel to @entity3			2
in fact , it may only take 210 days to reach the @entity3			2
this is a mere 30 days longer than a normal crew rotation on the @entity56			0
while we know about the negative toll of prolonged space living on the human body , astronauts returning to the gravitational force of the @entity119 recover from their stay in space			2
although research is still being done on the loss of bone mass , most other effects felt during space missions subside after physical therapy and treatment			0
@entity3 is also a much smaller planet than @entity119			1
this means the gravity felt on the surface is one - third what we feel on @entity119			0
once the settlers arrive on the surface after a seven - month space journey , their bodies will eventually adapt to the surface of @entity3			1
obviously , there will be unforeseen challenges in such a huge endeavor			0
but they should n't deter us from the attempt			0
if we never put our collective efforts together to do this , the human race will never fulfill its dream of living on another planet			1
we owe it to future generations , who will be left with the problems of @entity119 , to try to find new homes throughout the solar system			0
as long as there are volunteers like me willing to make the sacrifice , we will find ways to survive in space and beyond			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity197 .			2

@entity6 , a nonprofit , aims to establish the first human settlement on the @entity3
@entity197 : i signed up to volunteer for a one - way trip to @entity3
she says despite risks and challenges , the trip is *worthwhile* in what we can learn
@entity197 : for one thing , the human race can fulfill its dream of living on another planet
