@entity0 -- just a few weeks ago , a young boy tied to a bus stop in @entity0 barely received a glance from passersby oblivious to his plight			1
deaf and mute , nine - year - old @entity6 was regularly tied to a pole by his elderly grandmother for fear he would run into traffic on a nearby road while she was away at work			1
now , grandmother and grandson are living in a home for deaf and mute children , the patch of pavement where they both lived swapped for a roof above their heads			1
after reading about @entity6 on @entity1 in june , people wrote , tweeted , messaged , called and emailed from around the world			1
many wrote to express their concern			2
some wrote to ask how they could help			0
others sent funds to help rehabilitate @entity6			1
one person started a @entity31 page to raise awareness about his plight			0
" i was under the impression -- ' who cares for such stories ? ' " said @entity35 , a social worker with the @entity36			0
she 'd been trying to find @entity6 a more suitable home since placing him in a government - run shelter for juveniles in june			1
it was better than the street but not suitable for a boy with cerebral palsy who needed dedicated care			2
@entity35 took on @entity6 's case in late may when a constable called her after seeing the boy 's photo in a local newspaper			1
@entity6 was tied to a pole with rags and his elderly grandmother , @entity57 , was obviously struggling to take care of him as well as herself			1
" he is deaf so he would not be able to hear traffic coming			1
if he ran onto the road , he 'd get killed , " @entity57 told @entity1 in june			1
" see , it 's a long rope , " she said , holding out a piece of frayed cloth			0
there were many similar pieces of cloth tied to different poles			2
a life of struggle @entity57 told @entity71 's father had passed away four years ago			0
his mother deserted them and his older sister ran away			0
she had done the best she could , selling trinkets on a nearby beach to earn a meager wage to feed them			0
there was no money for shelter so she stretched out a piece of cloth on the ground behind the bus stop where they both would sleep			2
@entity35 struggled to find @entity6 a suitable home			1
@entity0 only has one government - run center for children with special needs and there was no room left for him			1
her exasperation turned to hope when a father and son team , @entity95 and @entity94 , stepped in with an offer to take in @entity97 for free			0
they also offered his grandmother a job in their hostel , in @entity102 , a scenic hill town not far from @entity0			1
" @entity6 's a special case , " said @entity103 , who runs @entity104 ( @entity105 ) , a non-governmental organization that caters to deaf and mute children			1
" his father died , his mother and sister abandoned him			0
what happens after his grandmother ? " hostel offers new hope @entity1 accompanied @entity6 , his grandmother and @entity35 to @entity102			1
he 's the first mentally - challenged student to live in the @entity105 hostel , which until now has only been for children who ca n't hear or speak			1
@entity94 said there were " thousands of @entity119 in @entity120 " who desperately need a roof over their heads			0
he said there are some homes for children who are deaf and dumb because they are comparatively easier to look after			2
however , children who are mentally - challenged need dedicated help : more staff , attention outside of school hours , funding , and infrastructure			0
" that 's lacking everywhere in @entity120 , " @entity94 said			0
@entity6 appeared to settle in quickly into his new surroundings			1
within an hour of reaching the hostel , he was running around in the yard , playing with the other children , each one a child of special needs , each one quickly engaged in a game of tag			2
they are some of the more fortunate ones			0
lack of care in @entity120 according to the last census conducted in 2011 , around 26.8 million people are in living with disabilities in @entity120			2
that 's 2.2 % of the population of more than 1.2 billion			0
other bodies , including the @entity153 , say the figure is much higher			0
many of them are children whose needs are n't being met by government shelters			2
even the government admits the lack of facilities for disabled children in @entity120 is a serious problem			0
" there should be lots more institutions for these kinds of children , " said @entity164 , a member of the government - run @entity165 in the state of @entity168			0
when asked why the state had not established more institutions , she said the responsibility did not lie with the government alone			0
" society and government should come forward and have some rehabilitation plans for special needs children , " she said			0
she was unable to provide details of any specific plans the government has to rehabilitate thousands of other children like @entity6 in @entity120 , many of whom remain invisible and ignored			2

@entity1 met @entity189 on the pavement in @entity0 where he lived with his grandmother

@entity6 was taken in by @entity105 , a non-governmental organization
