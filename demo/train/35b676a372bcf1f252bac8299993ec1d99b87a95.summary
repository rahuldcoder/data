@entity0 -- the @entity2 can seem a distant , dusty place , far removed from what young people , especially , see as relevant in their lives			1
it 's an institution closed to cameras , with justices issuing dense written opinions while working mostly from their private chambers			1
so how do you get high schoolers interested in the important judicial stakes that affect everyone ? attorney @entity16 has found a way , using digital technology to give students the power to pick high court winners and losers through an interactive hands - on nationwide competition			1
through his @entity26 website , @entity16 created a nationwide teaching tool involving 200 classes around the country , and growing			1
using a fantasy league concept popular with sporting events , @entity16 organized a web - based game where students analyze current high - profile cases , then predict the outcomes			1
points are awarded , and winners get bragging rights , badges of honor and @entity41 recognition			1
" it 's not dry history , these cases are live , they 're new , " @entity16 told @entity1			1
" the big thing is they have n't been decided			1
high school students in the past have been told to accept the law , but here they can participate and have a stake in the outcome , by making predictions			1
" the 26 - year - old @entity53 , @entity54 , native created the lesson plans in his spare time , with the help of a few friends			1
he works as a law clerk for a federal judge in western @entity63 and hopes to be a law professor one day			1
the year - old project is an offshoot of a larger fantasy league he also created , targeted at adult court aficionados			1
@entity16 explains he did all this initially as a hobby -- " almost as a joke " -- after a colleague dared him to test his skills at picking the winning side in several big @entity2 cases in 2009			1
" people around the world play it and seemed to like the original version , but then teachers started calling me , saying they were using it as an educational tool			1
they said it was too hard to navigate , " said @entity16			2
" so we modified things , making it easier to operate , using basic @entity88 and a simple points system			2
" through his nonprofit @entity90 -- named after the first justice @entity91 -- @entity16 also gathered a teacher advisory network , having volunteer lawyers appear via @entity94 to various classrooms			2
a recent " @entity104 " found him and other attorneys advising students on court prediction strategy in seven schools -- from @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 and elsewhere , even @entity103			1
among the @entity2 cases the students are predicting : whether states can ban " violent " video games from being sold to minors and the free speech rights of an angry anti-gay church group that protests loudly at the private funerals of military personnel killed in wars overseas			1
rulings in those appeals are expected next spring			2
one attractive feature for cash - strapped schools is that the @entity119 project is free			1
funding comes from private donations , combined with the relatively inexpensive operating costs			2
technology also allows volunteer lawyers to advise students without having to leave their offices , through computer video linkups			1
in addition to enlisting teachers and lawyers , the project is working with @entity134 , the education resource founded by retired justice @entity129			2
" it 's been blast , seeing young people connect with the law in a way i never had the opportunity to when i was a kid , " @entity16 said			2
" they 're looking at the @entity142 now not as this dead document , but something they can participate in , where they can try and make a difference			2
" technology is music to @entity152 's ears " it 's a brave new world			2
" so says justice @entity152 on the technological changes occurring in his court and in his own life			2
the 74 - year - old jurist revealed his heavy use of an @entity160 media player and @entity162 portable tablet computer , for both work and pleasure			1
speaking at a recent black - tie dinner sponsored by the conservative @entity166 , @entity152 said his musical tastes tend to opera and classical works , which he proudly noted he downloads himself			1
many of his fellow benchmates shun technology , preferring to handwrite the first drafts of their opinions and communicate through formal hand - delivered paper messages			1
but the senior associate justice says he relies on his computer so much , he " can hardly write in longhand any more			2
" and his @entity162 is filled with the reams of legal briefs he needs to read up on pending and current cases			1
he can now take his caseload anywhere he says , and does not have to " schlep the [ written ] briefs around			2
" but @entity152 told the audience another powerful communication device will not soon invade his courtroom : television			2
as he has said many times before , the justice worries that greater public access to the open sessions where the court conducts oral arguments would not necessarily be a good thing			2
" familiarity breeds contempt , " he said			0
" the fact that the court is somewhat removed is a good thing			0
" @entity198 and other broadcasters have long pushed to televise the court arguments , with support from several lawmakers			0
only audio of the sessions is available , but those recordings are released days after they happen			0
the public , of course , can attend in person , but seating is limited and requires waiting in line			0
@entity152 admits most of the cases are fairly boring , about such areas of law as bankruptcy and utility taxes			1
what he worries about are the hot - button cases like abortion and gay rights , where isolated comments by the justices aired by the media could be taken out of context			1
and one televised event you are not likely to see @entity152 attend is the @entity227 , which he compared to " cheerleading sessions			0
" as judges , the justices are not supposed to show any favoritism , so they sit there politely in their black robes			0
" i do n't know at what point that happened , but it has happened , and now you go and sit there like bumps on a log while applause lines cause one half of the @entity240 to leap up while [ the other ] causes the other half to leap up , " he said			0
" it is a juvenile spectacle			0
and i resent being called upon to give it dignity			0
" sitting in the @entity166 event at a local @entity0 hotel was @entity152 's conservative colleague justice @entity247			0
he came under some criticism after january 's @entity227 for mouthing the words " not true " when president @entity250 slammed the court 's ruling in a controversial campaign finance case			0
@entity247 later said he felt " like the proverbial potted plant " at such occasions and would not be attending in the near future			0
@entity152 was more blunt : " you just sit there , looking stupid			0
" for the generally verbose and animated jurist , sitting still for an hour or more at such a gathering may be an exercise he would just as soon avoid			0
shooting with friends so what does @entity152 do in his free time ? take a field trip with the newest justice			0
he and @entity267 , both native @entity54 , were seen recently at a suburban @entity0 gun range , according to legal sources			0
@entity152 had invited @entity267 , 50 , for an afternoon of target practice soon after she joined the high court			1
the ideological opposites were spotted skeet shooting , with the more experienced @entity152 offering tips on holding the shotgun for the apparent novice			0
@entity277 involves firing at clay targets propelled into the air from various angles			0
@entity152 is a member of the @entity281 and @entity282 , but neither the company nor the court would comment officially on the excursion			0
sources close to both justices say @entity152 and @entity267 have gotten along famously in their first few months together on the bench			0
the conservative @entity152 , those sources say , has warmly embraced his new liberal colleague and fellow @entity291 alum			0
@entity152 has been a longtime gun owner and hunter			0
as a high school student , he was a rifle team member			1
as he once recalled , " i used to travel on the subway from @entity295 to @entity296 with a rifle			0
can you imagine doing that now in @entity54 ? i mean , ' there 's a man with a gun ! ' " on a more serious note , @entity152 drew criticism after going shotgun hunting in @entity307 with then vice president @entity308 at a time when the court was considering an appeal over access to @entity308 's internal records			0
critics called it a conflict of interest and asked him to step down from the case , but he refused			0
to make things worse for the 2004 private trip , the hunting party did n't get many ducks .			0
