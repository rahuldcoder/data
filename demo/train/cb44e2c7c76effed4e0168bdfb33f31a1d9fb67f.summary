-- a top @entity2 congressman expressed concern about the " stability " of @entity6 leader @entity5 after months of provocative statements and behavior from the nuclear - armed communist state			1
" you have a 28 - year - old leader who is trying to prove himself to the military , and the military is eager to have a saber - rattling for their own self - interest , " said rep. @entity10 , the chairman of the @entity11			1
" and the combination of that is proving to be very , very deadly			0
" @entity6 launched a satellite into orbit atop a long - range rocket in december , conducted its third nuclear weapons test in february and announced earlier this month that it was abandoning the 1953 armistice that ended the @entity25			1
on saturday , it announced that it would not negotiate with the @entity2 over its nuclear program , challenging arguments that its weapons program was a bargaining chip that might be traded away for economic benefits			0
@entity10 , @entity32 , told @entity0 's @entity33 that @entity6 " certainly " has the missile capability to strike the @entity2			1
analysts say @entity6 is years away from being able to accurately deliver a nuclear weapon atop a long - range missile			1
but @entity10 said the fact that the @entity6 is willing to openly threaten the @entity2 with a nuclear attack " is problem enough			1
" " this is very , very concerning , as we just do n't know the stability of their leader -- again , 28 years old , " @entity10 said			1
" we 're just not confident that we know he would n't take those steps			2
" @entity47 disregarded numerous warnings to conduct february 's test and threatened afterward that it was prepared to launch a pre-emptive nuclear strike to defend itself			0
the @entity51 stiffened sanctions on the @entity6 after the test , with its leading ally , @entity55 , making the vote unanimous			1
the @entity57 has also renewed its threats toward @entity59 , warning of " strong physical countermeasures " after the sanctions vote			0
@entity5 is the grandson of @entity63 , the founder of the @entity6 state			1
he rose to power in december 2011 , after the death of his father , @entity67			0
@entity68 , a longtime @entity6 analyst at the @entity69 in @entity70 , said the @entity57 's recent actions have fueled debate about whether @entity5 " really is fully in charge , or whether the military is in charge			1
" " the three top military generals that were with him when his father died are all gone now , and we do n't know what happened to them , " @entity68 said on @entity0 's @entity76			2
" that could be a sign of him taking control , but it could also be a sign of some real churn inside the system where some people do n't like the fact that a 28 - year - old is now running the country			2
" and @entity93 , a former adviser to then - vice president @entity94 and former @entity2 ambassador to @entity59 , said @entity6 contacts he has met recently told him " that they have given up on their diplomats , and the military is now in control			1
" " what they want is to talk about moving from the now - disbanded armistice agreement to the creation of a peace treaty , " @entity93 told @entity76			0
" that 's what they want to talk about , and anyone who is willing to talk about that , they will listen to			0
anyone who wants to talk about what they call the old way , which was give up your nuclear weapons and then we 'll talk , is going to get nowhere			0
" @entity93 recommended engaging the @entity6 in new talks			2
but @entity68 , a former @entity120 official in the second @entity122 administration , said that ca n't be done so soon after their nuclear and missile tests , and he predicted " a very difficult period for the next couple of months or so			2
" " they do n't want to give up their nuclear weapons			2
they want to be able to have their cake and eat it , too , " he said			0
" @entity2 policy for the past quarter century or so has been , ' these things are all on the table if you 're willing to give up your nuclear weapons			0
' this is the problem			0
this is the dilemma right now			0

" we just do n't know the stability of their leader , " rep. @entity10 says
@entity10 is chairman of the @entity11
analysts debate whether @entity5 or the @entity6 military is really in charge
