-- the disease that carves an insidious path through the brain seems to be doing the same through sports			2
chronic traumatic encephalopathy , the degenerative brain disease associated with concussions , has been identified in both a soccer and a rugby player , according to a review in the journal @entity11			1
the brain tissue of people found to have @entity14 displays an abnormal build - up of tau -- a protein that , when it spills out of cells , can choke off , or disable , neural pathways controlling things like memory , judgment and fear			1
@entity14 can be diagnosed only after death			1
according to dr. @entity25 , a neuropathologist who has examined dozens of brains found to have @entity14 , the brain of the soccer player -- @entity29 -- displayed diffuse disease			1
" there was very severe degeneration of the frontal lobes with widespread tau pathology in the frontal , temporal and parietal lobes , " @entity25 , director of neuropathology at the @entity32 , said in an e-mail			2
" he is one of the youngest players to have shown this much disease			2
" former nfler : ' your mind just goes crazy ' @entity29 played with the @entity47 team and the @entity49 semi-pro team , according to his obituary			2
he died in 2012 at 29 after being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , a rare , incurable neurodegenerative disease			0
about 13 % of the 103 @entity14 cases uncovered by @entity25 and colleagues also showed evidence of progressive motor neuron disease			1
" ( @entity29 ) had no known genetic predisposition for @entity61 , " said @entity25 , professor of neurology and pathology at the @entity59			0
" and no family members have been diagnosed with @entity61			0
" an autopsy showed that @entity29 had stage 2 cte with motor neuron disease , according to a statement from @entity59			0
his case is interesting because it raises questions about the relationship between heading the ball and @entity14			1
" the fact that @entity29 was a prolific header is important , " @entity71 , co-founder and executive director of the @entity73 , said in an e-mail			0
" we need a larger discussion around at what age we introduce headers , and how we set limits to exposure once it is introduced			0
" heading would seem to be innocuous compared with the brutal hits that can be dealt in a football or hockey game , but the damage , according to studies , can add up			2
headers in soccer are associated with microstructural damage to brain tissue and memory problems ; and an @entity94 study linked them with @entity61			1
similarly , researchers found @entity97 rugby union player @entity96 died in 2013 of complications of severe @entity14 with dementia at age 77			1
@entity96 played for 19 years in amateur and senior leagues before becoming a coach , according to @entity59			0
" cognitive problems , memory loss , attention difficulties and executive dysfunction were first noted in his mid- 50s , followed by depression and anxiety , worsening explosivity and impulsivity , " the statement said			0
by his mid- 60s , the statement said , @entity96 was " physically and verbally abusive " and " paranoid			0
" @entity112 : ' i 'm going to beat this ' @entity14 is most commonly associated with football and boxing , but the disease has been found in the brain tissue of hockey players , wrestlers and , recently , in a @entity122 player			1
with the most recent findings , it would seem that virtually no sport is immune .			0

a new study identifies @entity14 in soccer and rugby players
@entity14 can *develop* from *repeated* blows to the head
the research raises questions about " heading " in soccer
