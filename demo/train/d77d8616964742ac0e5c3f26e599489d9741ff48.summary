@entity0 , @entity1 -- in most doctors ' waiting rooms , it 's the nurse who calls the mother and child for their vaccination			1
in @entity1 's @entity11 , nurse @entity10 has to go out and find her patients			1
with the @entity14 tribes constantly on the move searching for water and fresh pasture for their cattle , @entity10 can spend up to five days traveling 100 km searching the savannah for remote communities for whom her mobile immunization clinics are the only protection against deadly disease			1
" a week before we set off , we send out a message to the communities and ask them to spread the word that we are coming so we can vaccinate as many children as possible , " says @entity10			2
" tell them the chanjos [ vaccines ] are coming			2
bring your children ! " despite the beauty of the backdrop of mountains , lakes and stunning savannah , @entity0 's geography poses severe logistical challenges that leave @entity14 mothers waiting days rather than hours for the nurse -- not because of a backlog of patients but because the nurse struggles to reach them			1
there are rivers to cross , rough tracks that turn into mud beds in the rainy season , impassable even for 4x4 vehicles , and sometimes no real track to follow			0
the terrain means health workers often sleep in their vehicle and are forced to complete their journey by foot -- in a region renowned for its dangerous wildlife			0
" we do not often see lions , " says @entity10 , " but we can hear them at night and see their tracks by day			0
" see also : wildlife puts @entity1 on the tourist map in the soaring temperatures of @entity0 's equatorial climate , @entity10 's quest to find her patients is also a race against time : modern vaccines must be kept cool to preserve their powers of prevention , and a cold box packed with ice is @entity10 's very temporary defense			1
yet the children of the @entity14 can not afford to miss out on the protective powers of vaccines			1
" when a child falls sick in such areas , the greatest problem is getting them medical help , " says @entity86 , clinical officer at a health center in the @entity14 village of @entity89			2
" they have to be carried over vast distances to reach the nearest doctor			0
when they arrive , they are usually in a very bad condition			0
" @entity101 lives in the @entity14 settlement of @entity103 , near @entity89			2
she almost lost her 10 - month - old daughter to pneumonia and diarrhea			1
" when a child becomes sick , we carry them to the health center , " she says			0
" carrying a sick child , it can take four to six hours to get there			0
" as a tribe that was decimated by disease and famine in the 19th century , the @entity14 themselves are keenly aware of the importance of vaccinating their children			2
" there was an outbreak of measles here last august and a lot of children became very sick , " says @entity121 , from @entity89			2
" they took them to hospital , but five from this area died			0
i was lucky -- my son had been vaccinated against measles and he was one of the ones who got better quickly			0
" see also : fighting cancer with cell phones : innovation to save lives in @entity140 the need to get to hard - to - reach people like the @entity14 and the rest of the estimated 8 % of @entity1 's population that do not receive basic life - saving vaccines has taken on a new urgency with the country 's recent launch of a five - year development plan			1
the government wants to shift the national economy up a gear in its drive to transform @entity1 into a middle - income country by 2025 , and it is now widely acknowledged that investing in children 's health through vaccination is critical to building solid economic foundations			1
healthy children do better in school and have a better chance to reach their full economic potential			0
@entity1 president @entity166 is hosting this week 's high - level gathering of over 650 immunization experts in the capital , @entity170			1
the @entity171 ( 5 - 7 december ) will focus on how to achieve equity in children 's access to life - saving vaccines			1
to mark the event , the health ministry will launch two new vaccines into the national immunization program -- pneumococcal and rotavirus -- tackling the primary causes of pneumonia and diarrhea -- two of the leading killers of under - fives in @entity1			1
@entity1 's one plan aims to ensure that these new vaccines reach all children , from the @entity14 in the north to the islands of @entity193 , where boats are used to deliver medicine to the more remote of the archipelago 's many islands			1
" we have a strategy to reach every child with vaccination and we engage communities in planning and implementing it , " says @entity199 , manager of @entity193 's @entity200			0
however , @entity14 mothers remain fearful that the sheer geographical scale of @entity0 means that for them the waiting game is destined to go on			2
" of course we know how important it is to vaccinate our children , " says @entity121			0
" whenever we hear the vaccinators are coming , people bring their children			0
but sometimes they are so far away , they do not hear about the vaccination in time			0

getting vaccines to wandering @entity14 tribes in @entity1 can take days
about 8 % of @entity1 do not receive basic life - saving vaccines
