@entity0 -- forget about pushing voters to the polls in the final 72 hours			0
@entity5 war rooms are now just as focused on turning voters into votes weeks before @entity8			1
in their multi-front battle to win back the @entity11 and hold on to governor mansions , @entity5 operatives do n't want their supporters to wait until nov. 4 , and they 're investing real money , technology and manpower to try to match @entity17 , on a playing field the left has dominated in recent contests			1
many credit an early voting advantage by @entity17 for playing a key role in the 2012 presidential elections			1
the practice has upended the traditional electoral calendar and @entity5 have revamped their approach , at a time when 33 states and the @entity0 now offer some form of early voting			1
in key battleground states like @entity34 , where early voting begins monday , @entity5 operations are pouring more resources than ever into get - out - the - vote efforts ahead of @entity8			1
in @entity38 , where residents have been voting for the last two weeks , republicans are already starting to close the gap with @entity17 after investing more than $ 1 million to mobilize early voters			1
that 's a stark contrast to past election cycles when @entity5 " focused barely any resources on it , " @entity43 spokesman @entity42 said			2
" this midterm election cycle in particular has been the most early vote centered than any other election in previous history , " @entity42 said			0
" i think we 're going to make a huge dent			0
" in just the last week , @entity5 have requested absentee ballots at a faster rate than @entity17 -- more than doubling their count compared to just a 40 % increase for @entity17 in the last 10 days , according to numbers provided by the @entity38 secretary of state 's office			1
registered republicans have also mailed in their early ballots at a faster pace than @entity17			2
and while both parties have gotten their voters to submit more ballots than in 2010 so far , early @entity5 votes have more than doubled from 2010 while @entity17 have only posted a 36 % bump			1
but @entity17 still lead overall by more than 11,000 early votes and while @entity5 expect to continue closing the gap , they do n't believe they 'll undo their rivals in the early vote count -- at least not this cycle			1
" they 're playing catch up , " @entity75 communications director @entity74 said			0
" they 're trying to teach their base about [ early voting ]			1
so we 're already a couple steps ahead of them on that			0
we know that our base is going to be voting early			2
" like her @entity5 counterparts in @entity38 and other states , @entity74 declined to share early voting targets and program specifics			1
but @entity17 are doing well , increasing their early voting turnout from the 2010 midterm as @entity17 ballot requests already account for more than half of all requests			1
and in @entity34 , @entity5 have spent months in the ramp up to early voting season building what @entity96 spokesman @entity95 called " the largest grassroots operation the party has had in modern history			1
" " this is by far the most infrastructure that we 've had in place , " @entity95 said			0
" in years past , this would be the point where everyone would start opening up headquarters and making calls			0
" instead , @entity5 in the state have already cranked out about 700,000 calls and have about 1,000 " grassroots leaders " working a strengthened fieldwork operation thanks to smartphone " walk apps " that have replaced bulky walk books that had to be manually logged into the database			2
compounded with a " robust mail program , " automated phone calls , emails and a social media push , @entity5 in the state are hoping to mobilize more supporters to vote early for gov. @entity120 and @entity5 @entity11 candidate @entity121 , who are both locked in competitive races			2
those efforts have helped @entity5 identify those supporters in a state with no partisan voter registration -- and now the race is on to turn them out , and early			2
those supporters will now hear from fieldworkers next week -- many for at least the second time -- reminding them that early voting has started			1
" we just have a lot on the line			0
we have highly competitive gubernatorial race and @entity11 race going along for almost six months			0
republicans wanted to be a part of this [ early voting push			1
] we wanted to make sure that we set a precedent , " @entity95 said			0
" we want to let voters , the national media and also @entity17 know that this is a red state and we 're not going to give an inch			2
" democrats are n't rolling over to let @entity5 catch up , though , and the @entity146 's vice chair of voter registration and participation @entity147 said the @entity17 turnout operation has been operating in every state that has early voting			1
" these elections are all about turning people out , " @entity147 said			0
" democrats definitely can not afford to have the kind of drop off we saw in 2010			0
we 're redoubling our efforts			0
" @entity158 officials are also laser - focused on ramping up their early vote turnout operation , @entity158 spokeswoman @entity157 said			0
" we know that we need to increase our voter base to win in november and that means turning out voters who do n't typically vote in mid-term elections , " @entity157 said in an email			2
" we 've always done absentee and early vote gotv but we 've put a new emphasis on it and broadened our efforts			0
" this year @entity5 launched a voter mobilization website that helps people figure out where they can vote early and encourages them to take up the " vote challenge " on @entity175 to encourage their friends to vote -- @entity177 ice bucket challenge			2
and the increased and more targeted data in @entity158 databases is going right into fieldworkers ' hands , integrating email and social media campaigns that encourage republicans to vote early with boots on the ground for the first time , @entity157 said			0
in the perennial battleground state of @entity38 , @entity5 officials have even brought in outside helping , hiring strategist @entity191 to boost the party 's early turnout operation			1
" we 're confident that we 're going to have the kind of results that will make it very difficult for @entity17 to get the kind of lead that they need to win statewide elections this year , " @entity191 said			0
@entity191 said his efforts are part voter mobilization , part stimulating cultural change among @entity5 voters who tend to prefer the traditional , polling booth method of voting on the first tuesday of november			1
even @entity191 said he still prefers to vote on @entity8 , and does			0
and @entity191 said @entity5 are looking to capitalize on a high - energy midterm election that is expected to generate higher turnout than the 2010 midterm -- pushing voters to mail in their vote ahead of nov. 4 will help @entity5 better manage @entity8 efforts			2
" you never know what 's going to happen late in the campaign , " @entity191 said			0
" there are twists and turns that happen in the campaign			0
you 'd rather chase your voters early and get them in the door			1
" and state party officials say @entity5 candidates @entity221 and gov. @entity222 have also been more visible in driving voters to flood the early vote			1
the focus on early voting in @entity38 came this summer when the governor 's campaign pushed the state party to make early voter mobilization a priority			1
" [ @entity222 ] made it really clear that this is how they thought that @entity5 needed to run their campaigns and their party to get back to winning not just the @entity11 race but state senate races as well , " @entity42 said			0
but even @entity239 concedes that @entity5 have been playing catch - up , not just on the early voting front , but also in overall fieldwork this summer			1
" ultimately , i do n't think anyone in the @entity43 is going to say we had a better ground game than the @entity17 did in june or july , " @entity42 said			2
" [ but ] we 've rapidly raised the resources to be competitive			0
