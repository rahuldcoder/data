presidential race is going down to the wire and with @entity4 and @entity5 looking to sway those undecided voters , the @entity0 president has secured the backing of an unlikely supporter -- @entity9			1
the @entity14 star is widely seen as one of the two greatest footballers on the planet at present , along with @entity19 rival @entity18 , and knows what it takes to win , with a trophy cabinet boasting medals for the @entity24 , the @entity10 as well as the @entity11 and @entity12			1
never afraid to seek the limelight , the @entity25 joins former @entity28 colleague @entity27 in outlining how he would exercise his vote in the @entity0 elections should he have one -- with both men identifying with the @entity34 's current resident			1
" i like the way he speaks with people , his communication -- i think it 's always firm what he says -- and i would like to meet him because he 's an honest person , " @entity9 exclusively told @entity39			2
last month , @entity44 star @entity27 revealed a hitherto - unseen political interest after the third and final televised debate between the @entity48 and @entity49 candidates			2
" watched all the presidential debates			0
if i had to vote , would vote @entity4 , " tweeted @entity27 , who has over five million @entity52 followers			1
neither @entity27 nor @entity9 can vote in the elections given their nationalities but @entity4 can count on some similarly heavyweight sporting figures back home -- with baseball legends @entity57 and @entity59 having both pledged their support to the @entity48			1
@entity62 wide receiver @entity63 has been one of the largest donors to the @entity4 campaign , pledging $ 73,000 , while @entity66 , @entity67 and the legendary @entity68 were among a bevy of @entity71 stars who participated in august 's ' @entity72 ' , a fund - raising basketball event which drew a host of stars			2
celebrity endorsement despite the credentials of those standing behind their man , a leading professor of @entity78 warned that the impact of such celebrity endorsement is far weaker now than it has been in years gone by			0
" the candidates are hoping to grab a bit of airtime , free advertising in effect , through these stars but there are so many different channels of information that this gets diluted now , " says @entity84 - born @entity83 from the @entity85 in @entity44			0
" there has just been so much more to focus on at this election , in that it has been such a close race			0
the stars can create a bit of a ripple , and it 's a nice talking point , but it 's not the same as it was 20 years ago when the @entity101 left used to make an impact			0
" today , the biggest celebrity is ( former @entity0 president ) @entity104 and when he came out this weekend he got the type of treatment that is usually reserved for sports and entertainment celebrities -- the issue for the @entity110 is that they have no one to match @entity104 's impact			0
" @entity5 supporters that may be , but @entity110 candidate @entity5 does have the backing of one of the biggest sporting icons in @entity0 history -- former golfer @entity117 , whose tally of 18 majors is still unsurpassed			1
now 72 , @entity117 -- who rallied @entity123 fans to vote for the @entity110 ahead of their game this weekend -- could help @entity5 in the key voting state of @entity126 , where the ' @entity117 ' lives			1
other leading sports figures backing @entity5 are fellow golfer @entity129 , tennis ' four - time major winner @entity130 , legendary @entity133 quarterback @entity132 and @entity134 , who captained the @entity0 to 1980 @entity136 glory following the famous @entity138 win over the @entity139			1
" it has been over 10 years , so many of you may have forgotten , but in 2002 , due to bribery scandals and mismanagement , the @entity136 - not just those @entity142 - but the @entity143 as an institution - were threatened			0
thankfully , @entity5 was there , to salvage a desperate situation , " @entity134 said of a man who helped restore some order to @entity150 's controversial hosting of the @entity143			0
" just like the @entity143 needed @entity5 's leadership 10 years ago , @entity0 desperately needs @entity5 's leadership today			0
please join me in making him the next @entity156 ! " on monday , both @entity4 and @entity5 spent the final hours of the campaign making a mad dash through battleground states in a late push to sway a closely divided electorate ahead of tuesday 's election			1
in a final 24 hours , @entity4 and @entity5 -- or their campaign surrogates , including their wives and the vice presidential candidates -- are scheduled to make stops in @entity126 , @entity168 , @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 , @entity175 and @entity176			2
the push comes as national polls show the race is tied			0
a new @entity39 poll showed 49 % support for @entity4 and 49 % for @entity5 .			2

@entity14 star @entity9 says he would vote for @entity4 if he could
@entity25 joins former @entity28 colleague @entity27 in choosing @entity4 above @entity5
@entity5 camp is backed by @entity117 , @entity130 and @entity132 among others
