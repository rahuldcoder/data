@entity0 -- car owners who have replaced a vehicle 's airbag in the past three years , take note : that new airbag could be an unsafe fake			1
federal officials on wednesday warned motorists and auto shops that counterfeit airbags pose a danger to consumers , saying the bags could fail to deploy or even hurt people in car wrecks			1
concerns over counterfeit airbags heightened last month when authorities tested 10 fake airbags seized as part of a criminal investigation			1
all 10 failed , authorities said			1
some failed to inflate , others partially inflated and one exploded , showering the crash test dummy with metal shrapnel			1
to date , there are no known injuries or deaths resulting from the counterfeits , the @entity29 said			0
but officials said they fear the counterfeits could hurt motorists and passengers if they go undetected			1
" these seemingly genuine airbags are in fact shoddy fakes , " said @entity38 , director of @entity39 , which seized 2,500 counterfeit airbags during fiscal 2012			1
" these airbags do n't work			1
they 're not going to save you in an accident			0
they are a fraud and a danger from start to finish , and you do n't want them in your car , period			0
" officials cautioned that only a small fraction of all cars -- estimated at 0.1 % -- have the counterfeit airbags			1
" they are good fakes			0
they look like the real thing , " said @entity62 , administrator of @entity29			0
" and frankly , a consumer is not going to be in a position to figure out whether they have a fake or a real airbag			2
" the agency said the following people may be most at risk : -- those who have had airbags replaced in the past three years at a repair shop that is not part of a new car dealership			2
-- those who have purchased a used car but are not familiar with its history			0
-- those who own a car with a title branded salvage , rebuilt or reconstructed			0
-- those who have purchased replacement airbags over the @entity88 , especially at unusually low prices , such as less than $ 400			2
if motorists suspect they may have a counterfeit airbag , they should contact call centers established by car manufacturers to have their vehicles inspected			2
a list of call centers is available at @entity98			0
government and industry officials noted that consumers will bear the cost of inspections			2
" the bad actors here are the counterfeiters , " said @entity105 , a spokesman for the @entity106			0
@entity105 estimated the cost of inspecting airbags at between $ 100 and $ 200 , and the cost of replacing a steering wheel airbag at between $ 750 and $ 1,000			0
" and some cars have eight airbags , " he said			1
@entity62 said his agency is working with automakers to develop a system to verify authentic replacement parts and to raise awareness of the potential risks of counterfeit parts			0
@entity38 said earlier this year that customs agents arrested a @entity125 broker selling nine brands of counterfeit airbags in the @entity128			1
that broker has been convicted and is in prison , @entity38 said , and multiple investigations into other brokers are continuing .			0

in tests , fake bags failed to work , and one even exploded , authorities say
