-- pressure is growing for world leaders to respond to @entity4 's brutal crackdown on anti-regime protests			2
earlier this week , the @entity7 ' @entity6 , @entity8 , said more than 5,000 people had been killed in @entity4 since the uprising began in march			1
the @entity4 government has issued activists in the restive city of @entity14 an ultimatum : cease their protests , or face bombardment , prompting fears of an increase in hostilities			2
human rights activists have called for an international response to the violence -- but some diplomats have warned that any intervention could make the situation worse			1
@entity27 , of the @entity29 - based @entity28 , said events in @entity4 amounted to a " humanitarian crisis , " just like that seen in @entity33 prior to the @entity35 intervention , and that the situation merited a similar response			1
" when the international community went to @entity33 to protect civilians , were they deceiving [ everyone ] ? " he told @entity0 's @entity40			0
" because if the principle of protecting civilians is the motivation of the international community , what happens in @entity4 is no different from what happened in @entity33 -- it 's the same atrocities , the same tyranny and the same crimes against humanity committed there			2
" but @entity53 , a former @entity54 ambassador to @entity33 , said there was no comparison between the two countries -- or between @entity4 and @entity58 , another high - profile example of international intervention			1
" @entity4 is different in many , many ways			0
@entity58 was invaded by a foreign government , and seven , eight years later , is in ruins , " he said			0
" @entity33 was not invaded by a foreign government ; in @entity33 there was an uprising which so far seems to have succeeded in overthrowing a tyranny and is on the way to building something to replace that tyranny			0
" @entity4 bears no resemblance to either of them			0
@entity4 is a larger country than @entity33 , it 's a more complicated country than @entity33 , it does n't offer any scope for foreign intervention			2
" refugees seek shelter in @entity78 @entity53 said politicians and diplomats were unlikely to take major action against the @entity4 regime without backing from the @entity7 -- and that such support was unlikely			1
" i think the situation in @entity4 is absolutely dreadful , and if i could think of a way that the @entity54 government , or any other government , or the @entity7 could intervene effectively , i would be all for it , but i think intervention would probably make things worse , " he told @entity0			1
" when foreign air forces started to take part in the @entity33 struggle back in march , they had a clear mandate from the @entity7 , which meant that under international law , what we did could be argued to be legal			0
" there is no possibility whatsoever that we will get a mandate from the @entity7 to intervene in @entity4 as things stand at the moment			1
" but @entity27 said such pragmatic attitudes were making the situation worse , accusing foreign powers who failed to act of " participating in the bloodshed in @entity4 " by default			1
and he said he feared the influence of @entity4 military defectors , the @entity112 , on the protests -- unless the fighters were offered international support			0
" the numbers of the @entity112 -- without being supported by the international community -- is so small now , and the big risk is when these peaceful demonstrators are tempted by the @entity112 to hold arms and then we move to a stage of militarizing the uprising , which is a very big risk			0
" the people in @entity4 are trying hard to stick to the principle of peacefulness , " he said			0
" i do n't think that will last forever , but if we have militarization of the uprising , then we will heed to a civil war and i think this is the last thing the international community wants to see in @entity4 , because any civil war in @entity4 would be spreading very quickly to the neighboring countries			1
