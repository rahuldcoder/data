-- @entity1 has claimed a surprise pole position for sunday 's @entity3 , but qualifying positions were once again almost a secondary consideration in a race already overshadowed by ongoing protests in the @entity9 kingdom			1
the @entity10 was more than two - tenths of a second faster than triple world champion @entity13 , who admitted he held back at the end when he saw how far ahead the @entity16 driver was in saturday 's final session			1
" when i got told the gap to @entity26 , it was clear that even with a perfect lap he was unbeatable today , but nevertheless i 'm very happy , " said the @entity19 star , who won last year 's race from pole at the @entity23 circuit			1
" we managed to save some tires throughout qualifying and it will be about tire degradation tomorrow , so we 'll see what happens			0
" @entity36 interactive : explore @entity23 's highlights @entity1 won the second pole of his career , but downplayed his hopes of repeat last season 's success of winning from the front of the grid in @entity46			1
" for the first time this season everything went perfectly today and that 's a great feeling , " he said			0
" the race tomorrow is a different story			0
it will be difficult , especially with the rear tires , and we know that other teams were stronger than us on the long runs on friday			0
it will be a big challenge to stay ahead , but starting from the front helps			0
" @entity58 will start third for @entity59 , and the @entity60 is confident of repeating his victory last time out in @entity63 after also deciding to conserve his tires by giving up his final run , with track temperatures rising above @entity67 and playing havoc with the rubber			1
" at the last corner , i saw i was half a tenth to one - tenth slower so we decided to come in and save one lap on those tires -- you never know if you 'll have to use it in the race , " @entity58 said			1
he will start the race alongside teammate @entity79 after @entity16 ' @entity80 was dropped five places from fourth -- having needed a new gearbox after problems in final practice -- and @entity19 's @entity85 was demoted from fifth to seventh because of his grid penalty following a collision in the @entity46 race			1
" i started on the hard ( tires ) , it can be that i gain positions on the first stint because of that , " said @entity79 , who took a different tire strategy to @entity58			1
the @entity96 duo of @entity97 and @entity98 will start fifth and sixth respectively , while @entity100 ' @entity99 -- who was fastest in friday 's practice sessions -- will be eighth			2
@entity80 will be alongside 10th - placed former @entity103 teammate @entity102 , who succeeded him as world champion in 2009			0
" the best chance to gain some positions will come at the start and then we 'll see how it goes , " said @entity80 , who won pole in @entity63			2
" @entity111 degradation will be a huge factor so it 's going to be a very interesting race			0
" several media outlets reported that human rights protesters clashed with @entity117 's security forces into the early hours of saturday morning			1
@entity118 , the head of @entity119 , told a group of television reporters that the @entity117 government was " stupid " to host the race because it can be used " as a platform for people to use protesting			2
" " the government here were stupid , in a lot of ways , to put this race on , " the 82 - year - old said saturday ahead of the qualifying sessions in response to a question from a @entity131 reporter the race was canceled in 2011 after violent protests by factions of the majority @entity140 population against @entity117 's @entity142 rulers			1
@entity36 bosses tried to reschedule it for later that year but backed down in the wake of widespread criticism and a lack of evidence that the situation had stabilized			0
last year 's race passed without incident , though there were again protests before it was held			2
the @entity117 government insists the race will bring long - term benefits to its people			2
" @entity36 brings significant benefits to everyone in @entity117 , especially economically , " it said in a statement friday			1
" @entity117 upholds the right to peaceful protest			0
it is a country made up of many communities with different views on its development			0
" this is why it has launched a dialogue between all political groups to address political issues in a manner that will ensure the country develops in a sustainable way			0
it should be noted that in some cases protests encouraged by extreme opposition groups result in deliberate and targeted violence			0

@entity16 driver @entity1 earns second pole position of his career in @entity117
he will start ahead of fellow @entity10 @entity13 , who was second for @entity19
@entity59 's @entity58 is third quickest as he , like @entity13 , opts to conserve his tires
reports say protests against @entity117 rulers and the @entity36 race continued into saturday morning
