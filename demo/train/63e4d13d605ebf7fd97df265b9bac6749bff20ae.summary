that foods can soothe , reduce anxiety and boost your mood is well known to anyone who has kept a vise grip on a pint of @entity7 at midnight or dived into the deep end of a party pack of chips at the end of a day gone awry			1
in a perverse way , ice cream and chips do represent a fast - track to happiness			1
a load of simple carbohydrates provides an instant lift because carbohydrates trigger the rapid release of serotonin , the mood - elevating " happy hormone			1
" when the brain produces serotonin , we experience a calming effect			1
but the problem with a simple carb overload is that it sets off a physiological chain reaction that wreaks havoc on the body			1
it also taxes the adrenals , suppresses the immune system for hours after intake and generally leaves a person feeling sluggish and off - kilter			1
and then there 's the sugar crash			1
caffeine is no panacea either			2
" people who are working a lot and not getting enough sleep often reach for that extra cup of coffee because they think it 's going to help them			2
but in reality the caffeine makes things much worse , " says @entity48 , a registered dietitian			2
" when you 're anxious and stressed out , your body is already stimulated			2
add caffeine , which is a stimulant , on top of that , and you 're setting yourself up to crash and burn a few hours later			2
plus , you 're dehydrating yourself , which makes you feel even more fatigued and stressed			2
you also end up depleting valuable hormones in the long run			1
" @entity61 , a @entity62 - based registered dietitian and specialist in sports nutrition , says , " we used to have to run for our lives , literally , but we 're not doing that anymore			2
now most of us are sitting for our lives and livelihoods			2
people think all that sugar they eat is going to their cells -- and some of it does			2
but the extra sugar floating around is going straight to the fat cells			2
it usually builds up in your waistline			2
and that 's how stress is related to gaining weight			1
" what 's more , says @entity61 , another side effect of stress eating is that your brain becomes conditioned to want the cookies , bagels , chips and doughnuts			1
" over time , your brain creates these reward pathways			2
and come 2 p.m. to 3 p.m. , you 're craving those doughnuts			0
and that 's when you become vulnerable , because once those reward pathways have been created , willpower alone is not going to work so well for you anymore			0
" i imagine my biggest vice , an oatmeal chocolate chip cookie , happily rolling down its very own reward pathway in my brain			0
so what do you do then ? " you need to create a new pathway , a new happy memory , " @entity61 says			0
" i tell my clients that when afternoon comes and you have those cravings , maybe what you need to do is get up and take a two - minute walk			0
or take 10 deep breaths , which will also help lower cortisol levels			0
maybe you really are hungry , in which case you need to eat something both satisfying and nutritious			0
you have to find other ways of channeling the energy and coping			0
" @entity113 , interim dean of the @entity114 at @entity115 , speaks to the psychology of stress eating : " food is more than nutrition			1
it can have nutritional value , but it also has cultural and social value			0
sometimes our beliefs about food may be influencing behavior as much as the nutrition			0
" she cites one study in which students were sent either a doughnut or banana , both with an equal of number of calories and sugar grams			0
the students who were given a doughnut reported feeling worse about themselves and their body image after they ate it			0
in a second study , subjects were provided with the same milkshake , except one group was told it was high in calories , while the other was told it was low			1
the people who thought they had a high - calorie shake were much more likely to indulge in @entity148 ( frosted cream - filled devil 's food cakes ) afterward			1
" the thinking was , ' i 've already messed up so i might as well keep eating			0
' " @entity113 recommends having healthy snacks handy			0
" most people have a lull around 3 p.m. if you 're stressed out and all you can find is junk food from the vending machine down the hall , you may start this cycle that can lead to even more stress , " she says			1
" having some fruits and vegetables readily available lets you indulge in something sweet that tastes good and has nutritional value , without the snowball effect			0
" according to @entity61 , when it comes to eating to reduce stress , your general goal is twofold : boost the happy hormones ( serotonin and dopamine ) and reduce the stress hormones ( cortisol and adrenaline ) , which take a toll on the body over time			1
@entity180 and @entity61 , both national representatives for the @entity182 , offer nutrition - based recommendations for combating stress , including : indulging in complex carbs			1
all carbs prompt the brain to produce more serotonin			0
the trick is to stick to more complex carbohydrates because they digest more slowly and keep blood sugar levels stable			1
@entity180 suggests a bowl of oatmeal , whole grain , high - fiber breads and pastas , beans and lentils , which are packed with b vitamins to help keep up energy levels			1
@entity61 also recommends quinoa , sweet potatoes and fruit			0
according to @entity180 , crunchy raw veggies such as baby carrots , celery and radishes are great stress reducers because the act of crunching releases tension in the jaw without adding many calories			1
eating the right kind of fat			0
foods high in @entity217 fatty acids -- walnuts , almonds , flaxseeds , pine nuts , wild tuna and salmon -- help control unhealthy surges in stress hormones			1
they are also protective against mood disorders such as depression and are important for brain function			0
" if you are able to think clearly , you will be better equipped to deal with stress , " @entity180 says			1
increasing your @entity234 - rich foods , such as citrus fruits , do double duty because they can reduce stress hormone levels even as they boost the immune system , which is often compromised when we are under a lot of stress			1
studies show that theanine , an amino acid found primarily in green tea , can have a calming ( but not drowsy ) effect while helping to lower elevated blood pressure			0
ultimately , the big picture that emerges is much less about short - term solutions and more about creating a diet filled with less processed , more wholesome foods that can provide greater health , well - being and energy -- foods that can also help shore up the immune system by counteracting the pervasive stress in most of our lives			1
" you have people consuming these ' light , ' 40 - to 60 - calorie snacks , with lots of additives and very little nutrition , " @entity180 says			0
" with the sight and smell of food , and the chewing , our digestive enzymes are released			0
but lo and behold , 20 minutes later , there is no actual ' food ' to be had			0
our body is n't digesting anything remotely nutritious and thus is n't satiated			0
that can trigger a low - grade stress hormonal response , and when it 's happening over and over again , it 's really taking a toll on our bodies			1
" ( if you 're having trouble figuring out how to make better choices as you 're wandering the supermarket aisles , check out @entity286 and @entity287 -- two smartphone apps and also websites that offer suggestions for healthier food alternatives			0
) " eat the right combinations of real food at the right time , " @entity61 recommends			0
" your body will be less taxed , and it will also be better able to handle stress			1
