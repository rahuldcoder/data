-- at age 59 , @entity1 may have something new : a franchise			2
the two - time oscar winner added to his string of successes this weekend with " @entity8 , " which had no equal at the box office , opening with an estimated $ 35 million in ticket sales			1
it 's the 15th time in 15 years that a @entity13 film has debuted with $ 20 million or more , but not one of those movies has been -- or had -- a sequel , let alone a franchise			2
@entity1 : the essential roles that may change with " @entity8			1
" it has been widely reported that @entity21 , the studio behind the action thriller loosely based on the ' 80s tv series , hopes it will spawn at least a sequel			0
the film 's solid debut , one of @entity13 's best , certainly makes that a solid prospect			2
of course , @entity13 's career itself is something of a franchise			0
as this weekend 's box office shows , audiences are far from tired of seeing this star in star vehicles , righting wrongs and dispensing justice , violently when necessary			1
the only difference is that @entity13 , as he nears his 60th birthday this december , may finally be set to play the same character in more than one movie			0
a sequel is already in the works for " @entity45 , " which yielded the top spot at the weekend box office , but managed to hold off the debut of the stop - motion animated film " the @entity51 " for second			1
meanwhile , that other star for the senior set , @entity55 , did n't fare nearly as well as @entity13 , as " @entity56 " slid from second place all the way to seventh			1
ticket sales dropped by two - thirds in its sophomore weekend			0
as for the year 's top movie , " @entity64 " is now at $ 319 million and counting in domestic theaters , ranking behind only " @entity66 " and " @entity67 " among @entity70 's @entity69 lange of mega-hits			2
domestic weekend box office estimates from @entity73 ( final numbers available monday afternoon ) : 1			1
the @entity75 -- $ 35 million 2			1
the maze runner -- $ 17.5 million ( $ 58 million in 10 days ) 3			0
the @entity51 -- $ 17.3 million 4			0
@entity77 -- $ 7 million ( $ 22.6 million in 10 days ) 5			0
dolphin tale 2 -- $ 4.8 million ( $ 39.7 million in 17 days )			0

@entity1 's " @entity8 " makes an estimated $ 35 million
" @entity45 , " last week 's box office victor , comes in second
@entity55 's " @entity56 " drops from 2nd to 7th
