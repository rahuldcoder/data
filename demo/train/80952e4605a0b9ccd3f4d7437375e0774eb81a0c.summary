-- from " @entity3 " to " @entity2 , " last week 's @entity1 made one thing abundantly clear : 3 - d gaming is just around the corner			1
but despite what the game console makers @entity9 and @entity10 might suggest , gamers may not be ready for another dimension to invade their lives			1
thanks to the well - timed arrival of @entity18 - ready tv sets and video game systems , though , players may soon have no choice but to welcome the in - your - face medium			1
heroes and adventures will be designed to pop from your television screen			0
there will be no escaping it			0
@entity9 's handheld 3ds system , for example , will showcase 3 - d graphics on a small screen -- without requiring users to wear clunky @entity18 glasses			1
the dual - screened handheld makes the strongest case for the concept yet , thanks to its convenient , affordable ( at least , compared to current living room setups ) and simple , no - glasses approach to three - dimensional play			0
it 's impressive that the @entity42 is able to offer genuine @entity18 special effects on a 3.5 - inch display , which is n't bigger than many smartphones			1
meanwhile , the handheld system , which does not have a scheduled release date or listed price , does have a compelling list of game titles , including " @entity51 , " " @entity52 , " " @entity53 " and " @entity54			0
" familiar @entity9 staples will also reappear on the new system			0
they include " @entity58 : uprising " and " @entity59 : @entity60 " enhanced versions of popular franchises like " @entity63 " and " @entity64 " are also in the works			0
the three - dimensional games are restricted to @entity9 's handheld device , however			1
@entity10 's @entity68 is the first set - top box to receive a software update that allows @entity18 games			1
and graphics on the system burst from the tv screen like pop - up - book cutouts			0
the first @entity68 games in @entity18 were released on june 10			2
they include the crash test dummy simulator " pain , " a futuristic racing game called " @entity80 " and a modern - day " asteroids " clone named " @entity82			0
" a demo of arcade speedster " @entity85 : @entity86 " is offered as well			0
@entity88 titles such as sci - fi shooter " @entity91 , " " @entity92 " and driving simulator " @entity93 " are also planned			0
one drawback : all of these @entity96 games require you to have @entity98 and a set of those stereoscopic , @entity18 glasses in order to enjoy the third dimension			2
3 - d graphics will be coming to two other major gaming systems -- the @entity106 and @entity108 's @entity107 -- via two games : " @entity110 : @entity116 " and " @entity117 " both of those systems require users to wear low - tech , red - and - blue @entity18 glasses , which break from the industry standard			1
you wo n't see 3 - d images like those in movie theaters today on the @entity106 or @entity121 yet			1
finally , gamers can also turn to their personal computers for @entity18 action			2
graphics maker @entity125 already offers a solution for playing over 400 games such as " battlefield : @entity129 " and " @entity130 " in @entity18 on your pc through its 3 - @entity133 platform			1
to do so , you have to own a @entity18 video card , monitor and active - shutter glasses			2
all of these hurdles -- combined with the price burden of getting all of this new equipment -- means @entity18 games will have only a small audience for now			2
plus , no one is really clamoring for these upgrades			0
there is n't an outcry among gamers that two - dimensional games are broken , for example			1
console makers still have some work to do before the masses will make the switch to three - dimensional gaming .			0

it 's entirely possible that gamers are n't quite ready for @entity18 to invade our world yet
thanks to 3 - d - ready sets and game systems , players will have to welcome the medium
*excitement* seems to *primarily* be coming from tv and games manufacturers
