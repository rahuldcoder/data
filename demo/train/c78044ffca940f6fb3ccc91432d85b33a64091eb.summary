and globe - trotters master the ultralonghaul flight			1
amazing advances in technology now let nonstop flights fly farther and cheaper for airlines than ever before			1
many follow routes that take them near the @entity13 as they whip over the top of the globe to the other side of the world			2
but these giant intercontinental leaps present their own challenges : how do passengers and pilots deal with annoying and potentially dangerous fatigue that comes with marathon air travel ? how do twin - engine planes figure into the future of longhauls ? let 's start with the king of nonstop flights : @entity30 flights 21 and 22 between @entity31 and @entity32 , @entity33			1
the route is the longest both in distance -- about 9,500 miles -- and in time -- about 19 hours			1
business traveler @entity37 is a big fan of this route because it avoids a connection in @entity40 , which he says saves six hours			2
all 100 seats aboard the flight are business class			2
add hundreds of in - flight movie choices , and longhaul travel is n't so bad for this @entity47 executive			1
" if you 're stuck on a flight , you might as well enjoy it , " says @entity37 , 39			2
his long - distance travel tips for surviving 19 hours aloft : " walk around			1
do n't force yourself to sleep			2
" ah yesssssssss , ssssssssslumber			0
conversations with ultralonghaulers inevitably will turn to the subject of sleep			2
specifically , avoiding jet lag			0
" you should try on the day before to get on the same clock as your destination , " advises @entity59 , 36 , an @entity60 exec who 's flown the route about a dozen times			2
" for long west - to - east flights -- a day or two before you leave , start moving your bedtime earlier in the evening			1
for long east - to - west flights , try to delay sleep until late at night			1
planning ahead makes you a lot more productive when you hit the ground			0
he logs more than 200,000 flight miles a year			0
your seating position on the plane is " absolutely key , " to a good longhaul , @entity59 says			0
@entity31 uses @entity76 with a spacious 1 - 2 - 1 seating configuration			1
the back two rows are even better with 1 - 1 - 1 seating			0
in general , @entity59 recommends aisle seats in the center section			0
sleeping is easier when " there 's no one climbing over you , " he says			0
seats behind the plane 's four wing - mounted engines will be louder , but some travelers enjoy being lulled to sleep by the jet noise			1
' dr. sleepgood ' sleep is @entity95 's business			1
during his 19 years as @entity98 's chief engineer for human factors , pilots nicknamed @entity102 " because he helped them manage fatigue on longhaul flights			1
" buy a seat that has a bed , and you 're fine , " @entity95 says with a chuckle			0
( the price tag -- often thousands of dollars -- is the real challenge			0
) sleeping in a coach seat is no easy feat , @entity95 acknowledges			0
try to sleep at the time when your body is asleep , he says , although " that 's not always possible			1
" and avoid eating a heavy meal			0
for the traveler , avoiding exhaustion is nice if you can swing it			0
for pilots , it 's critical			1
longhaul passenger tips -- do n't be a clock watcher -- wear loose clothing -- stretch your legs -- take off your shoes -- @entity129 teeth every few hours to freshen your mouth -- use noise - canceling headphones , pillows , neck rests , moisturizer , eyedrops source : @entity30 passengers @entity95 ran a 1989 @entity140 / @entity139 study that recommended allowing @entity142 pilots to catnap in the cockpit -- but only under supervision of another pilot			1
cockpit napping is allowed for pilots in @entity148 , @entity149 , @entity150 , @entity151 and elsewhere			2
it 's been accepted by the @entity153			0
the @entity139 wo n't allow it			0
" longhaul flights require relief crews , " the @entity139 said in a written statement to @entity1			0
" rest is provided outside the cockpit			0
the @entity139 does not permit napping in the cockpit on @entity142 air carriers			0
" the @entity139 's rejection of cockpit napping " does n't makes any sense , " @entity95 says			2
" everyone i talk to who uses it says it 's an important stopgap measure to improve safety and reduce sleep loss			2
" related : @entity171 probes whether pilots fell asleep @entity174 investigators said they were concerned that pilot fatigue was a factor in july 's deadly crash landing of @entity178 , a @entity98 which caught fire on a @entity181 runway after a 10 - hour flight from @entity183			1
the @entity174 has not yet issued a final report on the reasons behind the crash			0
international longhaul pilot @entity187 says he 's seen the effects of flight fatigue firsthand			1
" it 's tough , " @entity187 admits			0
" it affects your reasoning surrounding your flying and the speed that your brain processes information			0
" @entity187 predicts that the @entity139 eventually will reverse itself and allow cockpit catnaps			1
" the international standard allows it , " he says			0
" i think it 's safer to take a controlled catnap			0
i 'm in favor of it			0
" here 's what @entity142 longhaul pilots are allowed to do to manage fatigue : typically , during a 14 - hour flight , the captain and first officer will fly the first three hours			1
then , they hand off the plane to a second crew and get some rest in a special compartment -- or in reserved seats in the passenger cabin			0
during the cruise portion of the longhaul , pilots use various methods to keep sharp , such as checking fuel consumption and navigation , adjusting the ventilation , turning up cockpit lighting and engaging in energetic discussions with the other pilot			2
every three hours , the two crews will switch off command of the cockpit until about 90 minutes before landing , when the captain and first officer will land the aircraft			2
twin - engine longhaulers so , those are some of the ultralonghaul challenges for humans			1
as for the machines -- they have their own hurdles			0
obviously over vast oceans it 's critically important for airliner engines to be reliable and powerful			1
but hey , it 's a business , so the engines also have to be efficient enough to keep airline fuel costs low			1
the twin - engine @entity98 holds the long - distance commercial airliner record			1
in 2005 it flew 13,423 miles from @entity251 to @entity252			0
total time : 22 hours , 22 minutes			0
decades ago , that meant ultralonghaulers were likely four - engine planes , like the 747			1
in the unlikely event that an engine failed , the other three engines could power the plane the rest of the trip , no problem			2
the downside : four engines guzzle a lot of fuel			0
" now , engines are way more reliable , " says travel expert and former airline manager @entity269 of @entity270			1
they 're also more powerful and fuel - saving			2
that 's why @entity98 's twin - engine 777 @entity275 flies so many of the world 's longest nonstop routes			1
in the coming years look for newer wide - bodies to fly more longhaul routes , like @entity98 's twin - engine @entity281 and the twin - engine @entity283			1
both aircraft are made with superlightweight materials which also cut down on fuel costs			0
already , @entity288 has announced its @entity289 will begin 14 - hour nonstop service from @entity181 to @entity291 , @entity292			2
@entity293 plans to use the plane for a 10 - hour nonstop from @entity295 , @entity296 , to @entity252			2
the @entity139 requires twin - engine planes to fly within close reach of a safe landing spot , in case of engine trouble			1
some travelers seem intrigued by the idea that an airliner can fly in a straight line with only one engine			0
" would n't the thrust from the engine be unbalanced and make the plane fly in circles ? " they ask			0
if a 777 lost one of its two engines , the plane has a computer that automatically adjusts the aircraft 's controls to compensate for unbalanced thrust			2
pilots flying other airliners may have to manually adjust the plane to compensate			2
how reliable are those engines ? " we 've never seen an issue where a twin - engine plane has lost one engine during a transoceanic flight and ca n't make it somewhere with the other engine , " says @entity269			1
" and engines almost never fail			0
with high reliability , airlines are free to look at economics and say , ' why would we have aircraft with four engines when we can have one that performs the same mission with two and save us money ? ' " what killed the longest flight in the world ? in fact , money is exactly what 's being blamed for killing the longest flight in the world			1
that 's right -- after nine years of service , @entity30 flights 21 and 22 are scheduled for cancellation			2
@entity269 and most other experts suspect the airline got tired of dealing with poor profit margins on the fuel - guzzling four - engine @entity351			1
" they do use a ton of fuel , and that 's always painful , " says @entity269			0
" but the schedule advantage is n't that great either when you fly so far			0
" also , the world 's second - longest nonstop -- a @entity30 18 - hour flight between @entity31 and @entity362 -- is scheduled to be canceled this month			1
that will leave @entity364 , a @entity365 from @entity366 to @entity367 , atop the list of world 's longest nonstops by distance , at 8,600 miles			1
the longest nonstop by time will be @entity375 's @entity374 -- a 777 from @entity376 to @entity377 which clocks in at about 17 hours			1
fans of the @entity31 - @entity32 flight say they 'll miss its spacious seats and well - trained flight attendants			1
on a @entity31 passenger website , commenter @entity383 -- tongue firmly in cheek -- called the airline 's decision to cancel the flight a " very sad day in the history of aerospace and aviation			1
first , man stops going to the moon			0
then the space shuttle stops flying			0
i will miss the @entity32 - @entity31 nonstop very much			1
" the way @entity402 sees it , for now , the airline industry appears to have pushed the longhaul envelope to the maximum			0
" that 's about as long as we 're going to get , " he says			2
" the days of the 19 - hour flight are over			1
" @entity1 's @entity409 contributed to this report .			0

@entity413 's longest nonstop flight ( 19 hours ) linking @entity31 and @entity32 canceled
*veteran* passengers , pilots and a sleep expert offer tips for ultralonghaul airline flights
many countries allow cockpit catnaps to stave off fatigue during long flights
more twin - engine planes are flying long routes because of powerful , reliable engines
