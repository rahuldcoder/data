-- republicans have been engaged in a lot of soul searching since the election			1
there are many reasons that they were not happy about the outcome of the election , but most frightening of all for the party was the fact that demographic changes and public opinion on social issues like gay marriage and abortion seem opposed to the party 's stances			1
" i went to bed last night thinking we 've lost the country , " said radio host @entity17			2
to be sure , republicans did well with large swaths of white voters and much of the map remained red			2
yet @entity22 clearly had trouble attracting @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 , women , younger college - educated voters or working class voters in states like @entity35 and @entity36			1
polls show that @entity22 are out of step with where most @entity28 are when it comes to the big social and cultural issues of the day			1
many voters felt that the @entity22 looked stale while @entity42 , even after four years with president @entity43 in the @entity44 , looked like the party that was fresh and moving in a forward direction			1
the question that many are asking is whether it is possible for the @entity22 to really remake their image , to sell themselves as a different kind of party that speaks to the future and not the past ? the answer from history is yes			1
between 1928 and 1936 @entity42 redefined themselves from a party that appealed primarily to urban machine voters and @entity60 rural voters into a national party that represented a broad coalition of industrial workers , progressive business leaders , university experts , farmers , immigrants and @entity28			2
the coalition would endure for decades , sustaining the party into the 1970s			2
@entity70 : how @entity22 can win the future republicans remade their image between 1974 and 1984 by scrapping the image of their party that had been seen as corrupt after the @entity75 as well as a party that had little to say to younger generations of @entity28			1
in the late 1970s and during @entity79 's presidency , the @entity22 became the exciting party of the future , bringing together a coalition of the religious right , neoconservatives , @entity60 , financial and business leaders , and " @entity42 " who bolted with their party			1
in each case , the parties made a number of crucial moves that were vital to the transformation			0
investing in the world of ideas helped give the parties some intellectual firepower			0
@entity96 drew on some of the best and brightest social scientists , most evident in his @entity98 , that introduced into the campaigns and @entity101 new programs for dealing with pressing social problems			0
during the 1970s conservatives invested huge resources in creating new think tanks , to counteract liberal institutions like @entity109 , and nurturing conservative intellectuals in the universities , all of whom contributed to the strength of @entity79 's arguments about deregulation , supply side economics and fighting communism			0
the next important step was to figure out ways to pick off key parts of the electoral base of the opposition , which was in some ways central symbolically to demonstrating that the electoral winds had shifted			1
@entity124 : can @entity22 handle prosperity ? during the 1930s , @entity96 did well with @entity28 as well as some @entity128 progressives , both constituencies that had made their home in the @entity22 until that time			1
but @entity96 demonstrated that he was the candidate better prepared to fulfill their ambitions			0
@entity79 did the same with @entity60 who had been so loyal to the @entity22 as well as with neoconservative @entity42 who were frustrated with their older party 's foreign policies			1
@entity96 and @entity79 themselves were also central to the story			0
in the 1930s and 1980s , having a charismatic and transformative leader who could define the party , and not just represent it , helped shift how people felt about these political leaders			0
during the 1930s immigrants hung pictures of @entity96 in their saloons and @entity28 listened on pins and needles to every word he said on his " fireside chats			0
" @entity79 also proved hugely popular even with voters who were not fully comfortable with his views			0
today , @entity22 need to find a little of all these things if they want to make a serious push to move forward			1
in the search of a compelling agenda , they will need to nurture new intellectual voices like @entity159 at @entity160			0
they will need to move forward on immigration reform which gives them the best chance to pick off some of the voters who brought @entity43 into office			0
they will need to challenge some of their own orthodoxies in an effort to move forward on big policy challenges as @entity170 sen. @entity169 , @entity171 , recently suggested when he took aim at @entity173			2
" i care more about my country than i do about a 20 - year - old pledge , " he said with regard to the now famous promise , organized by @entity173 , never to raise taxes			0
others in the party , including sen. @entity182 and rep. @entity183 , agreed with @entity169			0
they will need to find a leader , unlike any in the pack in recent years , who can shine on the campaign trail and who has the capacity to give the @entity22 a new brand name rather than just convincing voters to dutifully vote the party line			1
transformation is possible , but not easy			0
unless the @entity22 can take these kinds of steps it will continually struggle to retain the segments of the vote it already has , while ceding even more ground to the @entity42			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity203 .			2

@entity203 : republicans are *debating* their future after a *disappointing* election
he says @entity22 lost many demographic groups , seems out - of - step with @entity170
@entity203 : history shows it 's possible to find ways to turn the party 's fortunes around
he says @entity22 needs new ideas and new leadership to transform itself
