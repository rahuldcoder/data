eight @entity2 soldiers have been charged in connection with the october death of a fellow soldier in @entity6 , the @entity0 said wednesday			1
pvt. @entity7 , 19 , was found dead in a guard tower , apparently from a self - inflicted gunshot wound			1
@entity7 's family says that until they see the autopsy results themselves , they can not confirm or deny it was suicide			1
the eight officers and enlisted servicemen face various charges , including dereliction of duty , making false statements , maltreatment and involuntary manslaughter , the @entity0 said in a statement			2
the @entity0 did not specify what alleged acts by the soldiers resulted in the charges , which were filed wednesday			1
but in correspondence with his family before his death , @entity7 complained of harassment by his fellow soldiers			1
at a candlelight vigil for @entity7 held in @entity35 last week , his brother , @entity33 , read from a letter the soldier had sent to his family			1
" they ask if i 'm from @entity40 a few times a day			0
they also called out my name , ' @entity7 , ' in a goat - like voice sometimes for no reason			1
no idea how it started , but it 's just best to ignore it			0
" the @entity7 family told the @entity48 in october that officials said that @entity7 had suffered physical abuse and ethnic slurs by superiors , including an incident in which he was dragged out of bed and across the floor for failing to turn off a water heater after showering			1
in its announcement , the @entity0 makes no mention of the harassment allegations , but states , " as the legal process continues , further information will be published as it becomes available			0
" the charges stem from " conduct that occurred in the time leading up to ( @entity7 's ) death , " an @entity0 official familiar with details of the investigation told @entity68			1
he declined to be identified because the military criminal investigation remains ongoing			0
the @entity0 official said the soldiers are essentially charged with hazing and abusing @entity7 in the weeks and days before he apparently killed himself			1
but the case remains open and other charges could be filed , the official said			2
the soldiers facing charges were identified as 1st lt. @entity78 , staff sgt. @entity79 , staff sgt. @entity80 , sgt. @entity81 , sgt. @entity82 , spc. @entity83 , spc. @entity84 and sgt. @entity85			2
all the soldiers belonged to @entity87 , @entity88 , @entity89 , 1st @entity90 , @entity91 , the @entity0 said			0
@entity78 , the only officer charged , faces eight counts of dereliction of duty			2
the enlisted soldiers face more serious charges , including dereliction of duty but also maltreatment , assault , involuntary manslaughter and negligent homicide			2
the eight men charged have been moved to a different base in southern @entity6 and remain under restriction			1
they are not permitted to leave the base , the @entity0 official said			0
" we feel some comfort and relief to know the @entity0 is taking it seriously , " @entity7 's mother , @entity105 , said through a translator at a news conference wednesday			1
" we are cautiously optimistic because of today 's news , " said @entity112 , president of the @entity114 - @entity2 group @entity115 , who spoke as a representative of the family			0
but , she added , the family hopes that those responsible will be not just charged , but convicted			2
" they must be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law , " @entity122 added			0
rep. @entity126 , @entity128 - @entity127 , who was also present with the family at the conference , said that she has requested the autopsy results and asked the inspector general of the army to conduct a separate investigation			0
" we are here today to demand answers ... and that begins with a full accounting of all the facts , " she said			0
in a similar case earlier this year , three @entity139 were charged with beating and hazing a fellow @entity139 , @entity142 , after @entity142 fell asleep on watch duty			0
the @entity139 was beaten and forced to do exercises and to dig a hole until the early morning			0
when the punishment was over , he climbed into the hole he had just dug and shot himself , said rep. @entity149 of @entity150 , @entity142 's aunt .			0

the family is glad for the charges , but wants convictions
those charged have been moved to a different base in @entity6
