@entity0 -- president @entity2 unveiled a new $ 5 billion veterans jobs plan friday that the administration says will put thousands of men and women who once wore their country 's uniform back to work			1
the new veterans @entity11 initiative , first mentioned in the president 's @entity13 address last week , involves partnerships with the @entity16 and the @entity17 , as well as state and local law enforcement agencies			1
under the blueprint , the administration will award $ 166 million in grant money to communities that show a preference for hiring post- 9/11 veterans for new law enforcement positions			1
in addition , $ 320 million in grant money will be awarded to various fire departments who pledge to hire and train new veterans			1
money for those grants has already been appropriated by @entity34			2
the president , however , will now seek an additional $ 4 billion in his upcoming budget to expand both programs			2
@entity34 last fall rejected a similar proposal that was part of the president 's broader jobs initiative			1
the president rolled out the new plan during a speech at an @entity46 , @entity47 , firehouse			0
" this has been a top priority of mine , " he declared			1
" these are @entity52 that every business should be competing to attract			0
these are the @entity52 that we want to keep serving here at home as we rebuild this country			0
so we 're going to do everything we can to make sure that when our troops come home they come home to new jobs and new opportunities and new ways to serve their country			0
" the president 's upcoming budget will also include a $ 1 billion proposal to create as many as 20,000 new jobs for veterans relating to conservation efforts on @entity52 's federal and state public lands			1
that initiative , to be overseen by the @entity17 , would put veterans to work in visitor and tourism - related jobs as well as positions that will assist in general upkeep and maintenance roles throughout the country 's public parks and nature preserves			1
it is unclear what type of reception the overall proposal will receive on @entity90 , particularly among @entity91 who have been complaining about rising deficits			0
" these are commonsense initiatives to serve our 9/11 veterans who are coming home , " secretary of the interior @entity93 told reporters on a conference call			0
" we hope @entity34 does its job ( in approving the funding )			2
" @entity16 secretary @entity103 said thursday the president will also propose expanding training programs for entrepreneurial veterans seeking to start their own businesses			2
this program would include online training seminars conducted by the @entity110 lasting as long as eight weeks and could serve as many as 10,000 veterans annually , according to administration estimates			0
" our country owes them a debt of gratitude and we must ensure that veterans who come home from @entity119 and @entity120 get the opportunities they deserve , " @entity103 said			0
the unemployment rate for post- 9/11 veterans is 11.1 % , nearly 3 percentage points higher than the country 's overall unemployment rate			0
among the president 's few jobs proposals to clear @entity34 last year were new tax credits for businesses that hire recent veterans			1
@entity1 's @entity132 contributed to this report			0

new : @entity2 calls jobs for veterans " a top priority "
the initiative would involve the @entity16 and @entity17
grant money would be awarded to towns and fire departments that train and hire veterans
the proposal 's $ 5 billion price tag makes it a *potentially* tough sell in @entity34
