@entity0 -- for actress @entity6 , the criticism of a $ 50 million boost in funding for the @entity5 is a sequel			1
@entity9 winning actress @entity6 says giving money to the arts will save and create jobs			1
she was chairman of the agency from 1993 through 1997 when arts funding was cut sharply by the @entity16 - led @entity15 , which questioned whether it was an appropriate way to use government money			1
now the issue is whether giving money to the arts should have been part of the economic stimulus program			2
among those who have criticized the new spending this year is @entity26 gov. @entity25 , who delivered the @entity16 response to president @entity29 's message to @entity15 tuesday			1
on monday 's " @entity30 , " @entity25 said , " fundamentally , i do n't think $ 30 million for the federal government to buy new cars , $ 1 billion for the @entity33 , $ 50 million for the @entity5 is going to get the economy moving again as quickly as allowing the private sector to create jobs			1
" it 's no surprise that @entity38 disagrees and argues that arts spending can give a vital boost to the economy			1
the actress , who will appear later this month in a new comedy at the @entity0 theater company @entity44 called " @entity48 , " won a @entity9 for her role in the " @entity47			2
" she has been nominated eight times for an @entity50 and four times for an @entity52 for films including , " @entity54 " and " @entity55			2
" @entity38 spoke to @entity1 last week			1
@entity1 : what do you think of the controversy over the $ 50 million in increased government spending for the arts ? @entity38 : i think it 's long overdue and i was very , very happy to see it			1
since 1995 - 96 we had an incredibly decreased budget for the @entity5			1
finally we 're getting back to where it was when i came in [ as chairman ]			2
it 's all vitally needed			0
in fact , the endowment has not kept pace with inflation as other agencies have			0
... this $ 50 million will certainly help a great deal			2
what people forget is that there are over 2 million people in the @entity80 who are professional artists			1
those are jobs like any other jobs			2
the artists have families , they have people for whom they 're responsible and they give to their communities			2
we all have the right to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness			0
the life part would be health and housing			0
the liberty part would be our civil rights			0
and the pursuit of happiness , the arts would come under that			2
and it 's as vital a part of well - being in the @entity80 as anything else			1
@entity1 : when you say 2 million artists , could you define artist ? @entity38 : well they include everything from writers , painters , all the visual arts spectrum and that 's pretty large , including graphic arts			1
theater and so on , music , ceramicists , costume designers , makeup artists , filmmakers , it 's a huge panoply			2
@entity1 : how far can $ 50 million go ? @entity38 : well for the endowment which has had a budget of around $ 144 million currently , it can go quite a way			1
when i came in it was about $ 175 million and then it was cut under my aegis by @entity15 down to $ 99 million			1
@entity1 : some people will say that while the @entity5 may consider this a victory , it 's really a pittance , a drop in the bucket , so little money given the challenges many arts organizations are facing today			1
it will help , it will help enormously , because every single @entity5 grant that goes out is a challenge to the community to come up with the same amount of money , or a 3 to 1			1
... by the way , the public should know that within this coming year , we 're going to see an awful lot of arts organizations closing			2
i just came from working at a theater in @entity150 , [ @entity151 ] and the @entity152 , which has been going for 43 years , will close its doors this year			0
the @entity155 has already closed			0
the @entity157 [ @entity157 ] @entity156 has laid off 17 percent of its staff			0
@entity1 : so this is n't going to be enough to reverse those kinds of things ? @entity38 : no , but it will challenge the community to understand what the imperiled status of their arts organizations are			1
it will help an enormous amount , and for some organizations , it will make all the difference in their staying alive			0
now the @entity5 this fall gave out 884 grants , totaling $ 20 million and that was 38 percent of the project cost of the applicants			1
so 38 percent is a nice healthy piece of change for the cost of a project			0
@entity1 : how did you personally get involved in this cause ? @entity38 : as an actress who spent most of my career in nonprofit theaters , they began with the seed of an @entity5 grant back in the late 60s , most of them			1
today we have about 450 nonprofit theaters across the @entity80			1
back in 1965 , when the @entity5 was founded , there were only about 23 of them			1
@entity1 : your forthcoming play -- is that being done for a nonprofit theater ? @entity38 : yes			1
it 's another nonprofit called @entity44 in @entity0 , a small theater			0
what people do n't quite understand about theaters is that they never increase their size			0
they 're bound by the number of seats within a given theater , and meanwhile there 's inflation and the costs rise			0
so currently most theaters can never make more than 50 percent of their income from ticket sales			0
the rest has to be raised			0
@entity1 : how 's the company doing ? @entity38 : it had a good play last year , " @entity225 , " by @entity217 , which got a lot of attention but i do n't think it made back its nut on @entity224			1
it transferred from the nonprofit to a commercial venue on @entity224			0
... in the film business , independent films are considered nonprofit in many instances			0
it 's interesting to see that an independent won the @entity52			0
of course it was distributed by a major studio			0
" @entity237 " started off as an independent			0
... many of the commercial arts are fed by the nonprofit arts			2
and that 's another thing most people do n't fully understand			0
where do you think the @entity246 , the @entity247 of the world come from ? they come from small venues that are independent and are nonprofit usually and then they move into the mainstream			0
@entity1 : what 's your attitude about the future , under the @entity29 administration			0
do you think there 's reason for hope about the arts , or despair ? @entity38 : i think there 's reason for great hope			1
president @entity29 has said repeatedly and he 's said it for a couple of years now , that he thinks arts education is vital for children of all ages , starting right away			2
we have the arts in nursery school anyway , but he believes in institutionalizing the arts so it 's part of the curriculum for every child in @entity80			1
... everybody in all walks of life know people who are out of work presently or are about to be out of work			0
and the same is true for artists			2
i know so many artists -- for example visual artists , the gallery has closed or it 's cut back			1
theaters that are no longer going to do productions with more than five actors			0
so i know a lot of people out of work : costume designers , makeup people			0
and let 's not forget all the ancillary jobs from having an arts organization in your neighborhood			1
that includes restaurants , taxicabs , whatever			0
@entity1 : gov. @entity25 said he did n't think the arts money should be part of the economic stimulus plan			2
@entity38 : well what he does n't understand is that $ 50 million goes directly ... as a grant to organizations which employ people			1
it 's quick and it 's a system that works beautifully and it 's done within a year .			0

@entity6 : increasing funds for the arts is a good way to boost economy
she chaired the @entity5 when @entity16 - led @entity15 sharply cut its budget
she says about 2 million @entity80 are employed as artists of all kinds
@entity38 : *injecting* funds into the arts will quickly support jobs
