-- some people still doubt the @entity3 's chances for success , but current sales rates suggest that the device could rank among top consumer electronics categories within a year			1
as noted by @entity10 analyst @entity9 , consumers are adopting the @entity3 faster than any other consumer electronics device , including the @entity12 and the near - ubiquitous dvd player			1
" the @entity3 did not seem destined to be a runaway product success straight out of the box , " said @entity9 in a recent note to investors , acknowledging the many criticisms about the @entity3 's lack of certain features at launch			2
" by any account , the @entity3 is a runaway success of unprecedented proportion			0
" the @entity3 's current sales rate is approximately 4.5 million units per quarter , according to @entity26			1
that tops the 1 million per quarter that the original @entity12 sold at launch , and the 350,000 per quarter when dvd players first launched			2
if the current rate persists , the @entity3 could become a $ 9 billion per year business , blowing right past game consoles and cell phones to become the fourth largest consumer electronics category			0
that would put the @entity3 right behind tvs , smartphones and laptops			0
with numbers like these behind it , it 's no wonder that companies like @entity43 and @entity44 are rushing to score a piece of the touchscreen tablet market			0
with yet more competing products in the pipeline , @entity47 will have to work hard to translate its first - mover advantage into consistently stellar sales as it has done with the @entity52 and the @entity12			1

consumers are adopting the @entity3 faster than any other electronics device , an analyst says
sales rates *surpass* @entity47 's @entity12 and the near - ubiquitous dvd player
