-- for some it was an exhilarating holiday to an exotic place , finding new love or conquering their greatest fear			1
for others , it was witnessing an historic event			1
and for a few , it was simply a case of being in the right place at the right time to capture a moment that will forever stick in the mind			1
@entity0 asked people from all over the world to send in their highlight of the year			1
from the @entity19 , to @entity20 , to @entity21 , hundreds of people shared their most treasured images			1
2012 was the year the @entity24 games came to @entity25 , and , unsurprisingly , many people sent in their images of the various competitions held around the capital			1
@entity30 , who works as the artist @entity31 , was lucky enough to participate in the @entity33 ' spectacular opening ceremony -- playing a nurse			1
she sent in an image of proud participants posing eagerly just before they took part in the ceremony			1
" i like this [ image ] as it has performers from different categories -- a snapshot of the ceremony -- and reminds me of the excitement of the day , clearly visible on everyone 's faces , " she said			1
sport of a non-olympic kind captured the imagination of @entity52 from @entity53 , @entity54			2
he submitted this lively image of soldiers from the @entity58 of the @entity59 competing in the tug of war at the annual @entity33 in @entity61			2
" the sight of these soldiers in a brutal test of raw strength while combined with the skirl of the pipes , the colors and flash of the different tartans on the kilts , and the cheer of the crowd was a feast for the eyes and ears , " he said			2
" although , i understand that the music of the bagpipes may not be for everyone -- subtle it is not , " he added			2
from the bombast of organized games to the quiet joy of a proud parent , many people chose their children as the source of their best moments of 2012			1
@entity89 from @entity90 , @entity91 , captured a wonderful image of her son @entity93 wearing his @entity95 t - shirt on a bike ride in august			2
@entity93 was born with clubbed feet and a physical condition called @entity99 , which means he has little muscle strength in his limbs			2
his mother took the photo in august after casts set on @entity93 's legs to strengthen them had been taken off			0
" my cheerful and determined young man helped me to realize what matters in life and what does n't , " she said			0
" @entity93 is a very happy , easy going young man , not much can hold him back , not even being stuck in casts			0
i also love how he 's rocking that t - shirt ! " for some , 2012 was the year not just of striking out on to new journeys , but of returning home			1
@entity115 from @entity116 , @entity117 , was thrilled to be reunited with her soldier husband on his return from @entity120			0
the poignant moment when she was reunited with her husband was captured by her friend , @entity123			0
" my friend literally grabbed the camera out of my hands and pushed me in the right direction [ to her husband ] , " she said			0
" all the stress and fear and pain suddenly were replaced with love and magic and joy			0
i felt like i had gotten something precious back that was taken from me			0
" and sometimes it was images even closer to home that made for the best moments of the year			1
even right outside the window			0
@entity141 took these beautiful , surreal images from the window of his 50th floor apartment in @entity145			1
" it is foggy in @entity145 on rare occasions and usually lasts for two to three hours in the morning , " he said			0
" it was quite impressive , because it 's not everyday you wake up and you find yourself above the clouds			0
" and of course what year would be complete without at least one ambition being realised ? for @entity153 , a trip to @entity155 , @entity156 to ride a balloon at the @entity158 provided the chance to tick one dream off her life list -- particularly when she found out the rides were free			0
" i 'd always had a romantic image of hot air ballooning over the @entity165 or somewhere like that but have never been able to afford it , " she said			0
" the whole experience : inflation , take off , the quiet contemplation of the countryside and the aerial views , wondering where we would land and the fun of packing up the balloon before driving back to the launch site is something that will stay with me forever			0
