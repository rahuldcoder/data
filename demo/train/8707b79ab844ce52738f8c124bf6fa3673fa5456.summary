-- president @entity1 threw down the gauntlet to congressional republicans at his press conference on monday			1
he will not , he asserted forcefully , allow the @entity6 ' credit rating be held hostage by hard - liners demanding budget cuts " or else ... " in short , the president 's message was that he would not negotiate with fiscal terrorists			1
he may have sounded adamant and unbending to some			0
but his position was hardly out of place			0
speaker @entity16 and the republicans in the @entity18 are holding a gun to the head of the @entity6 economy and threatening to pull the trigger if the president does n't bend to their will			1
on some level , they must realize that allowing the @entity6 to default on financial obligations that @entity29 itself racked up would not only sow chaos in the financial markets and reignite the recession , but also sign the death warrant for the modern @entity35			1
if the @entity35 -- already a party at odds with science , history , math , women , senior citizens , the poor and minority populations -- were to willfully and recklessly play politics with the full faith and credit of the @entity6 , it would virtually ensure that by 2014 , @entity47 would retake the majority in the @entity18 and expand their edge in the @entity50			1
this could create a nightmare for many on the right : an @entity1 presidency in which @entity47 could press through their full agenda with little resistance			1
even the most rabid @entity35 partisans must recognize that they are playing with fire			1
news : @entity1 : we are n't a deadbeat nation they are overreaching in part to help redeem what was widely seen as a defeat for them in the tax deal that was struck at the beginning of the year -- the slight tax increase that was approved for the top 2 % of the population			1
of course , it is baffling why any among them would so focus on that small increase and neglect the fact that , with @entity1 's assistance , they managed to do what @entity79 could not and make @entity79 's tax plan permanent			2
no matter , the posturing of @entity83 is designed to make them appear resolute			0
unfortunately , it only succeeds in making them look demented			0
they say growth is the key to balancing the budget , but are pursuing the one policy most likely to derail it			2
they say they want to balance the budget to improve @entity6 's credit rating and international standing , but they seem willing to do more to damage either than any other @entity29 in memory			2
they say they want to force budget cuts but wo n't touch defense spending , the largest and most bloated area of discretionary spending in the budget			1
they seem to assume that the president will offer some cuts and that they will be able to say their toughness won the day			2
they think the @entity6 people will believe their use of the debt ceiling as a cudgel was principled and perhaps even courageous			1
they will offer themselves up as protectors of the national economic well - being			0
opinion : @entity50 holds key to fixing @entity121 this is a lot like a kidnapper expecting to be seen as a hero for releasing his captive			0
both parties bear plenty of responsibility for getting @entity6 in the fiscal mess we are in today			0
both will have to compromise to achieve real progress			0
taxes will have to rise more			0
defense will have to be cut			2
entitlements will have to be sweepingly reformed			0
real compromise and courage and principles will be required to a greater extent than either party has embraced or even publicly discussed			0
but just because neither party has done all it should , that does not mean both are equally responsible for this bizarre and dangerous episode			0
as the president rightly asserted , and as reasonable people in either party must acknowledge , playing politics with the debt ceiling must be put permanently out of bounds			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity153 .			2

@entity153 : @entity1 *challenged* congressional @entity35 on debt ceiling
@entity153 says @entity16 and @entity18 @entity35 are bizarrely holding nation hostage
he says they must know it will hurt them , but *continue* ; want budget cuts , but not to defense
@entity153 : playing politics with debt ceiling must be permanently out of bounds
