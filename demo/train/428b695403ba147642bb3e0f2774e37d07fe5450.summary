-- world number one @entity1 has crashed out in the quarterfinals of the @entity5 tournament in @entity6 , beaten in three sets by @entity9 @entity8			1
@entity10 champion @entity1 , who flew straight to the grasscourt event on the back of winning a record - equalling sixth @entity14 title , struggled for form throughout the week and was eventually sent tumbling 6 - 7 6 - 4 6 - 1 by fifth - seeded tsonga			1
@entity1 admitted he felt ' exhausted ' going into the tournament , but the result was still a major shock , with the @entity20 having reached seven successive finals prior to this defeat			2
@entity1 struggles past @entity23 to reach quarters " after losing the second set , mentally i lost my concentration -- it has been a lot of matches in a row , " @entity1 told reporters			2
" i am a little tired			0
i was n't there like usual and certainly i think i need a little bit of break , " he continued			0
a delighted @entity8 added : " the first time i reached the world top 100 was here at @entity36 and today i have beaten the world number one			1
it was close to my best tennis -- it has to be to beat @entity1			2
" @entity8 will now face unheralded wildcard @entity40 in the semifinals after the @entity44 number two , ranked 216th in the world , reached his first - ever @entity47 semfinal with a 6 - 2 6 - 7 6 - 2 win over @entity9 @entity49			1
meanwhile , @entity50 and @entity51 will clash in the other semifinal after both players cruised through in completely different circumstances			1
@entity55 and second seed @entity51 secured his place in the last four when scheduled opponent @entity58 of @entity59 was forced to pull out of their quarterfinal with an ankle injury			2
ironically , @entity51 himself has been battling a similar problem , picked up in last week 's @entity14 , and the @entity65 beat @entity66 on thursday with a brace attached to his damaged right ankle			1
" i would have rather played today , and got another match on the grass			0
it was n't to be , " @entity51 told reporters			2
" i just have to take this day as a rest day , which in some ways is probably a good thing , " he added			0
the extra day 's rest could well prove crucial prior to saturday 's clash with third seed @entity50 , who remains on course for a record fifth title on the @entity6 grass after crusing to a straight sets victory over seventh - seeded @entity20 @entity81			1
six players have won four @entity36 's titles , including @entity84 and @entity85 , but @entity50 will surpass them all if he carries on the form he showed in an impressive 6 - 2 6 - 2 win			1
meanwhile , holder @entity88 is out of the @entity90 grasscourt tournament in @entity91 , beaten at the quarterfinal stage by local favorite @entity93			0
@entity93 reached the semifinals for the fourth time in his career , securing a 7 - 6 6 - 3 win in 90 minutes , smashing down 14 aces in the process			0
he will now face third seed @entity100 , after the @entity9 beat @entity102 6 - 4 6 - 4			0
another @entity91 , @entity103 , also secured his place with a 6 - 3 6 - 7 6 - 3 victory over eighth seed @entity106			0
the 27 - year - old @entity103 will now meet 2007 @entity90 winner @entity108 , the top seed after @entity110 's withdrawal on monday , who saw off fifth seed @entity111 of @entity113 7 - 6 6 - 1 .			0
