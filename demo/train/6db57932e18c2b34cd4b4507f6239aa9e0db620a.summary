-- people with chronic pain who are n't getting enough relief from medications may be able to ease their pain by smoking small amounts of marijuana , a new study suggests			1
marijuana also helps pain patients fall asleep more easily and sleep more soundly , according to the report , one of the first real - world studies to look at the medicinal use of smoked marijuana			1
most previous research has used extracts of tetrahydrocannabinol ( @entity19 ) , the active ingredient in the cannabis plant			1
" this is the first time anyone has done a trial of smoked cannabis on an outpatient basis , " says the lead researcher , @entity22 , @entity23 , the director of clinical research at @entity25 's @entity26 , in @entity27			0
@entity0 : medicinal marijuana , state by state the study included 21 adults with nervous - system ( neuropathic ) pain stemming from surgery , accidents , or other trauma			1
fourteen of the participants were on short - term disability or permanently disabled			0
all of them had tried marijuana before , but none were current or habitual smokers			2
" they were not experienced marijuana users , " @entity22 says			2
" they came because they had severe pain that was not responding to any conventional treatment			1
" each patient in the study smoked four different strengths of marijuana over a period of 56 days			2
the @entity19 potency ranged from 9.4 percent -- the strongest dose the researchers could obtain legally -- to 0 percent , a " placebo " pot that looked and tasted like the real thing but was stripped of @entity19			1
( by comparison , the strongest marijuana available on the street has a @entity19 potency of about 15 percent , @entity22 estimates			1
) @entity0 : medical marijuana may help fibromyalgia pain the participants -- who were n't told which strength they were getting -- were instructed to smoke a thimbleful ( 25 milligrams ) from a small pipe three times a day for five days			1
after a nine - day break , they switched to a different potency			0
the highest dose of @entity19 yielded the best results			1
it lessened pain and improved sleep more effectively than the placebo and the two medium - strength doses ( which produced no measurable relief ) , and it also reduced anxiety and depression			1
the effects lasted for about 90 minutes to two hours , according to the study			0
the results were published in the @entity92			2
@entity0 : 8 natural remedies to help you sleep though small , the study adds to a growing body of evidence suggesting that cannabis has painkilling properties that may be useful in medicine , perhaps in addition to other treatments			2
@entity19 extracts have been shown to help ease cancer pain and the nausea associated with chemotherapy , while a few small studies in hospital populations have found that smoked marijuana can help relieve neuropathic pain			1
but medical marijuana is n't ready to become a mainstream chronic pain treatment , says @entity113 , @entity114 , director of the division of pain management at @entity117 , in @entity118 , @entity119			1
" the studies out there show some decrease in pain , but it 's not alarmingly or shockingly great , " says @entity113 , who was not involved in the new research			0
" although it may have some use , it 's probably going to need to be used with something else , if it 's approved			0
" as the study notes , the pain relief the patients experienced from marijuana was modest compared to that seen in studies of analgesic medications such as gabapentin ( @entity137 ) and pregabalin ( @entity139 )			1
@entity0 : 6 mistakes pain patients make @entity142 , @entity114 , an anesthesiologist at the @entity143 , in @entity144 , points out that the study did n't address whether marijuana enabled the patients to perform everyday activities without pain -- the best test of a chronic pain treatment			1
" i 'm not convinced [ marijuana ] helps from a functional standpoint , " he says			2
" i 'm not even impressed by the pain reduction			0
we have analgesics that do much better			0
" the potential long - term side effects of habitual marijuana use could prove problematic as well , @entity155 adds			0
over time some patients may experience weight gain , a generalized feeling of sedation , and even changes in mood and cognitive function , he says			0
@entity0 : can psychedelic drugs treat depression ? the study participants did report some minor side effects , including coughing , dizziness , headache , and dry eyes			0
few reported feeling " high " or euphoric , however , which suggests that abuse or addiction is not a major concern with amounts as small as those used in the study			2
" we had a total of three single episodes where patients felt a little bit high , " @entity22 says			0
" so it was extremely rare			0
the possibility that one would become addicted is low			0
" still , if marijuana were to become a more common pain treatment , it 's possible that some patients might overdo it , @entity113 says			1
" we saw the problem with narcotics			0
you ca n't ever predict which people , when prescribed , will abuse it or not			2
obviously there needs to be more research			0
