@entity0 -- for the @entity6 - fearing , @entity5 - educated @entity4 star @entity3 , it 's deja vu all over again except for two things : this time he 's entering @entity0 's @entity9 with an fat paycheck in his pocket and inflated expectations in the stands			1
" i still have to kind of remind myself that this is actually happening sometimes , " @entity3 told reporters in @entity0 , where he was making his redux debut as a rocket on thursday before a phalanx of reporters and cameras after the @entity20 failed to match @entity0 's three - year , $ 25 million offer for the point guard			1
" but it 's a huge blessing from @entity6 , and i ca n't believe how it all shaped up for me , and for me to be able to be here right now , i 'm definitely excited and thankful			2
" over the past seven months , the 6 - foot - 2 , 200 - pound , 23 - year - old of @entity29 descent has made quite a leap			2
@entity3 was waived by the @entity31 on december 9 and was picked up by @entity0 on december 12			1
he appeared in two pre-season outings with the @entity0 before the team let him go on december 24			1
the undrafted point guard then burst into the consciousness of the sports world in early february when then - @entity20 coach @entity37 called him off the bench as the team was struggling with an 8 - 15 start			0
as @entity3 's heroics led the @entity20 on an improbable seven - game winning streak , " @entity48 " entered the national lexicon and @entity3 's previous employer was among the millions who were paying attention			1
" we made an error by letting him go , and i think we rectified it now , " @entity0 owner @entity49 told reporters thursday			1
@entity3 said the @entity0 ' approach came as a welcome surprise			1
" i did n't know that they were that interested , but when i heard i was excited , just because i knew what the franchise was about			0
" and this time , he wo n't be sleeping on a teammate 's couch , as he did last year when he was just trying to make a roster			0
" it 's definitely nice to be able to have more job security , " he said			0
" it is n't necessarily the amount of dollars ; it 's the fact that i signed a three - year deal so i get to play this game in the @entity4 for three more years			0
i do n't think it 's all about money , but i think , at the same time , how much they put shows their investment and their belief in you as a player			0
" as for @entity0 , " i 've heard the fans here are very loyal and very crazy , " @entity3 told @entity1 's @entity77			1
" i 'm going to have fun playing here			1
however big the spotlight is , as long as me and my teammates are having fun playing basketball , that 's really all that matters			1
" asked if he was concerned he might prove to be a flash in the pan and not a perennial all - star , @entity3 said , " no one has the answer to that question			2
the only thing i can tell them is i 'm going to work as hard as i can and i 'm going to buy into this team and i 'm going to try to help the team become as good as we can			0
it 's not about how many times you can become an all - star , it 's about your own team 's success			0
" @entity3 said retired @entity104 , a @entity105 basketball star , sent him a text message of congratulations after his return to @entity0 was announced			1
" i 've always had so much respect for him , " @entity3 said			2
" i would watch him when i was a kid , anytime he would come to the @entity112 , i would buy tickets and go watch him play			0
" but now , the economics major is thinking about his own brand and , ultimately , his legacy			0
" when i 'm done playing basketball , i want people to think of me a certain way , and that is to play basketball the right way , play as a team , play unselfishly , play hard and then , off the court , to really serve and love other people			2
that 's where i want to go in terms of the brand			0
" being a role model for younger @entity132 is also important for him , @entity3 said			1
@entity4 stars have game off the court , too " i have a strong desire in my heart to be able to break certain stereotypes about @entity132 and @entity139 , especially in sports , " he said			2
" i just think as time goes on , i think we 'll start to see more @entity139 in sports			0
hopefully , we will be able to continue to earn more and more respect when it comes to sports			0
