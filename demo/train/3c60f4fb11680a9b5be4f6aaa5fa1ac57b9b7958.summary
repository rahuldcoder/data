-- no one who works full - time -- in this , one of the wealthiest nations on @entity5 -- should have to raise a family in poverty			1
that is the fundamental principle behind our work to increase the national minimum wage			1
and today , on 10/10 , @entity12 , we are saying louder than ever that hard work should be rewarded with fair pay of at least $ 10.10 per hour			2
every day for low - wage workers is filled with struggle and anxiety			2
we have heard from and visited with people making heartbreaking decisions about which bill to pay , which meal to skip , which growing child will get a pair of shoes this season and whether to buy a gallon of milk or a gallon of gas			0
for many of us , an unexpected car repair is an inconvenience ; for a minimum - wage worker , it is a catastrophe			2
the national minimum wage of $ 7.25 per hour is unconscionably low			1
it is an affront to our values , and it has remained unchanged for more than five years			0
during that time , the cost of food , utilities , transportation and other essentials has gone up , but low - wage workers ' paychecks have remained the same			1
in fact , the purchasing power of the minimum wage has been eroding steadily ( @entity46 ) since its peak in the late 1960s			1
today 's minimum wage would have to be well above $ 10 per hour to equal the purchasing power of the minimum wage in 1968			1
too many low - wage workers must rely on public assistance just to keep their heads above water			2
raising the minimum wage would allow up to 3.6 million people to come off the food stamp rolls			1
these workers would have the dignity and satisfaction of buying food with their own paychecks while @entity63 taxpayers would no longer have to pony up billions of dollars to subsidize the large companies that build wealth for shareholders on the backs of their workers			2
fortunately , many businesses are turning away from this low - road business model			0
poll after poll shows that employers -- especially small businesses -- are rallying around $ 10.10			0
we 've seen it firsthand in visits to these businesses , where they know that higher wages strengthen their bottom line by increasing employee loyalty , retention and productivity			0
businesses also know that they need customers with money in their pockets			0
when working families get a raise , they do n't stash it in offshore tax havens			2
they pump it right back into their local economies at the grocery store , hardware store or auto body shop			0
increasing the minimum wage boosts consumer demand , growing our economy and helping communities thrive			1
a century ago , long before there was a federally mandated minimum wage , he doubled the pay of the workers on his assembly line because he thought they should be able to afford the very cars they were making			1
he said , " if we can distribute high wages , then that money is going to be spent and it will serve to make storekeepers and distributors and manufacturers and workers in other lines more prosperous			0
... @entity122 high wages spell countrywide prosperity			0
" we , sen. @entity124 and rep. @entity125 , have offered legislation to increase the national minimum wage to $ 10.10 , which would benefit 28 million workers			1
polls show this increase is supported by an overwhelming percentage of @entity63 across party lines			0
but unprecedented partisan intransigence in @entity135 has kept it from moving forward			0
the @entity138 leadership of the @entity139 wo n't even bring the minimum wage bill up for a vote			1
and this past spring , it was filibustered in the @entity143 ; a minority of senators refused to even debate this proposal that a strong majority of the @entity63 people clearly support			2
the good news is that many state and local leaders are taking matters into their own hands			0
emboldened by grass - roots momentum and a groundswell of public support , they are raising the minimum wage in their own jurisdictions			1
thirteen states plus the @entity135 have done so since the beginning of 2013 , showing once again that sometimes change does n't come from @entity135 but rather to @entity135			0
president @entity162 is also using his executive authority to do what he can			0
last week , the @entity165 took the final steps to implement the president 's executive order raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 an hour for workers on federal service and construction contracts			1
too many of our hardest - working neighbors -- people who prepare our food , stock our grocery shelves , clean our offices , care for our children and seniors and more -- are working harder than ever but falling further behind			1
today , on 10/10 , we are proud to fight for them to get $ 10.10 , and we 'll continue to do so every day until we succeed .			0
