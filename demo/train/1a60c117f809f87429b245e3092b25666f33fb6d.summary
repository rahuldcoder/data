@entity0 -- voices recorded by inventor @entity3 more than 125 years ago are being heard now , thanks to digital imaging technology			1
" it 's not high fidelity , but you can definitely figure out what they 're saying , " said @entity6 of @entity7 , one of the scientists working on the project in a laboratory at the @entity12			2
the early audio recordings were made during an intensely competitive time , when scientists were racing to improve on @entity22 's phonograph , which was invented in 1877			1
scientists like @entity3 , who worked at his @entity24 in the @entity26 neighborhood of @entity0 , were looking to improve both the quality of the phonograph and the nature of the sound to make the product commercially viable			1
" i think this is a very critical episode in the history of @entity38 invention and innovation and it highlights an otherwise unknown aspect of @entity0 , at the end of the 19th century as the center of invention and innovation , " said @entity32 , curator of the @entity34 's @entity33			1
@entity3 sent recordings to the @entity34 in the 1880s for safekeeping , and to prove his scientific finds in case of patent questions			1
but there was no playback device , so " the collection has been silent , " said @entity32			0
enter modern - day scientists @entity6 and @entity55 , who took detailed photos of the discs made in @entity3 's laboratory and created a virtual playback machine on a computer			1
" to be or not to be , that is the question , " begins one of the recordings from a green wax disc that scientists believe was recorded in 1885			2
the male voice reading the famous quote from @entity68 is muddled , but understandable			2
on a glass disc recording from 1884 , a voice can be heard saying the word " barometer " several times			1
and on another type of wax recording from 1885 , a man is heard reading a description of a cotton factory in @entity78			2
to get the audio from the discs , the @entity80 scientists put them on a turntable			0
as the disc slowly turned , as many as 18,000 images per rotation were recorded in the computer			0
the images were then stacked up to create a digital profile , which , when read by the computer , played back the sound			0
" these technologies are very fast and these computers are fast , " said @entity6			0
" ten years ago , we would be struggling with computer storage and computer speed			0
today , commercial technology is up to this task			0
" there is no physical contact with the historically valuable discs , which helps to protect them for the long term			0
the scientists in the 1880s experimented with a variety of experimental mechanisms , many of which the @entity34 has in their collection			2
each disc or cylinder plays differently			0
" it turns out this record was designed to play from the inside - out , so that 's backwards from how we normally play a record , " said @entity6 , showing reporters the disc			0
after the @entity7 scientists had photographed that record , they reversed the information in the computer to play it			0
although the scientists at @entity3 's @entity24 would have been working on a playback device as they were making the recordings , none of those made it into the @entity34 's archives			1
three times during the 1880s , @entity3 sent sealed tin boxes to the @entity34 with objects and newspapers to prove that his laboratory had made certain discoveries by certain dates in case a patent dispute arose			1
the sealed boxes were opened for the first time in 1937 in the presence of @entity3 's family			1
@entity3 also donated materials to the @entity34 during the early 1900s , when he served on the governing board of the museum			1
those items , along with materials from @entity151 , a competitor of @entity3 , are stored at the @entity33			1
@entity151 is credited with inventing the gramophone , the first commercially successful disc and playback machine			0
the museum has about 400 early audio recordings made between 1878 and 1898 .			2

@entity3 was working on improving the phonograph
his early recordings are at the @entity34 's @entity33
" to be or not to be , that is the question " a voice on one recording is heard saying
