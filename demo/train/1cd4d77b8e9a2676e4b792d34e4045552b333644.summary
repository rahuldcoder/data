-- text messages sent from @entity4 's cell phone the day he was killed show he had been arguing with someone on the phone and was " hostile , " attorneys for @entity9 wrote in a recent court filing			1
@entity9 's lawyers argue the texts are relevant to the case , in which the unarmed teenager was fatally shot by the neighborhood watch volunteer during a confrontation in a @entity18 , @entity19 , neighborhood in february 2012			2
the texts speak to @entity4 's demeanor and emotional state , the thursday filing said , and " may assist the jury in understanding why @entity4 chose to hide then confront @entity9 rather than simply going home			1
" the filing said the texts were mostly with " witness 8 , " and the messages showed @entity4 and the friend were " hostile and angry with each other at various points throughout the day			1
" @entity4 , 17 , was talking on the phone with witness 8 when he and @entity9 met as @entity4 walked to the house of his father 's fiancee after a trip to a nearby convenience store			2
@entity9 to argue self - defense , will not seek ' stand your ground ' also in the document , @entity9 's attorneys say the court should also consider text messages sent before that day , because they establish @entity4 's marijuana use and fights he had been involved in			1
" this ( fighting ) evidence is admissible in support of mr. @entity9 's self - defense claim regarding the abilities and capacity of @entity4 as an experienced fighter , " @entity9 's attorneys wrote			1
the attorney for @entity4 's family , @entity53 , said thursday that evidence and other details -- like the defense 's assertion that @entity4 had removable gold tooth caps -- are " irrelevant			1
" he predicted they would never be used at @entity9 's trial			0
" is the defense trying to prove @entity4 deserved to be killed by @entity9 because ( of ) the way he looked ? " @entity53 asked in a statement			1
" if so , this stereotypical and closed - minded thinking is the same mindset that caused @entity9 to get out of his car and pursue @entity4 , an unarmed kid who he did n't know			2
the pretrial release of these irrelevant red herrings is a desperate and pathetic attempt by the defense to pollute and sway the jury pool			2
" two previous gag order requests by the prosecution have been denied			0
@entity9 's brother apologizes for offensive tweet instead , he said , jurors will focus on @entity9 's arrest for battery on a police officer , a domestic violence injunction and other issues he said demonstrate a " propensity for violence			0
" other items taken from @entity4 's phone included text - message discussions of drugs and pictures of a gun and marijuana plants			1
lead defense attorney @entity91 said he will try to use the evidence if prosecutors attempt to attack @entity9 's character during his trial on second - degree murder charges , set to begin next month			2
also thursday , @entity91 filed a request that his client 's trial be delayed			0
much of the new evidence disclosed thursday in filings by @entity9 's attorneys comes from @entity4 's cell phone , including photos showing a semiautomatic pistol and ammunition and small marijuana plants growing in pots			1
in another picture , @entity4 is pictured making obscene gestures in an apparent self - portrait			0
others show him with friends and in other settings			0
gun , drug texts feature in new @entity4 shooting evidence @entity9 recently waived his right to a pretrial hearing under @entity19 's " stand your ground " law , which allows people to use deadly force when threatened regardless of where they are			1
his attorneys will claim self - defense at trial			0
a representative of the special prosecutor handling the case did not return an e-mail message thursday seeking comment on the evidence			0
prosecutors renewed their motion for a gag order in the case thursday because , they said , they 're concerned about finding an impartial jury given the " inordinate amount of media coverage			0
" two previous gag order requests by the prosecution have been denied			0
arrest ' solely to placate the masses , " @entity9 's mother writes in - session 's @entity148 and @entity0 's @entity150 , @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 contributed to this report .			0
