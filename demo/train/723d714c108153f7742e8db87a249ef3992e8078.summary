-- a scholar of world religions writes a book about @entity4			1
a woman , whose politician husband is caught in a sex scandal twice , decides to stand by him			0
nothing out of the ordinary			0
but two giants of @entity13 mainstream media -- one on the right , the other left - of - center -- have come under criticism this week for interpreting the actions of the two through glasses tainted with ethnic slant			1
a @entity20 interview segment was widely derided online when the anchor kept asking author @entity22 how a @entity23 can write a book about @entity4			1
while @entity22 patiently explains -- repeatedly -- that it 's his scholastic expertise that qualifies him to do so , the anchor presses on with the same question			1
on the other end , @entity28 columnist @entity27 posited in an editorial that @entity31 continues to stay by the side of her philandering husband , @entity33 , because of her alleged harsh upbringing in @entity35			1
@entity20 interview @entity22 spoke to @entity37 on monday night about his experience on @entity39			1
" truly , i was kind of embarrassed , " he said			0
he felt uncomfortable having to repetitively parade his academic credentials by @entity39 anchor @entity42			0
" you really come off as a jerk , when you do that , " said @entity22 , who holds three degrees in religion			1
he has studied the life of @entity4 for 20 years and calls him his " hero			1
" @entity50 seemed wholly uninterested in @entity22 's qualifications			1
her first question set the tone for the rest of the conversation , in which she spent nearly 10 minutes casting religious doubt on his motivations for writing the book			2
" you 're a @entity23 , so why did you write a book about the founder of @entity64 ? " the video of the interview went viral , and @entity50 's reduction of @entity22 to his religion triggered a backlash on social media			1
" reza aslan 's interview on fox news was so painful to watch , he was basically being interviewed by a wall , " said @ nimbaaa on @entity72			2
some lambasted @entity50 for tenaciously skirting @entity22 's academic credentials , posting satirical comparisons , like this one on @entity72 from @ @entity79 : " i 'm a vet who has a ph.d. in treating animals			1
@entity42 : but you 're a human			0
@entity22 : but i have a ph.d.			1
. " " i have a ph.d. in oceanography , i study the ocean			0
but you live on land			0
yes , but my area of study is the ocean , " tweeted @ lamaquinapls in the same vein			0
critics from established media joined in			0
the @entity97 called the interview " strange , " adding that @entity50 gave @entity22 the " proverbial third degree			1
" @entity100 called the interview " cringe - worthy			0
" " is this @entity102 has ever done ? " @entity103 asked in a headline			1
@entity22 told @entity37 that he feels bad for @entity50			1
people get emotional , when academics write about their religion , fearing it is being attacked , he said			2
" nothing could be further from the truth			0
the most important people in my life are @entity113 -- my wife and my mother , " he said			2
@entity22 was born a muslim but felt inspired by @entity64 in his youth and converted , as he explains in an essay he wrote for @entity0			2
" when i was 15 years old , i found @entity4 , " he wrote			1
he later converted back to @entity119 , the religion of his ancestors			0
the @entity39 interview and subsequent media coverage have garnered his book more attention			2
on monday , it was the bestselling title on @entity126			0
@entity28 article the @entity28 ' ethnic slant was less belabored			1
it did n't take up a 10 - minute segment but instead just one single paragraph			0
@entity31 is a longtime aide of @entity132			0
her husband , @entity33 , has been caught twice sending explicit messages to women on social media			2
he was recently caught for the second time sending out lewd photos of himself			0
@entity31 pledged her love for him at a news conference			0
columnist @entity27 explained @entity31 's decision this way : " @entity31 was raised in @entity35 , where women are treated worse by men than anywhere else on the planet			1
" first , @entity31 is not exactly @entity35			2
her late father was from @entity150 ; her mother from @entity152			0
she was born in @entity153 , @entity154 , but the family moved to @entity35 when she was 2			2
she moved back to the @entity13 to attend @entity156			0
she began her @entity158 career as a @entity160 intern , before working in @entity132 's office , when @entity162 was first lady			2
some could not help but see the irony in the same situation connecting both women , in light of the @entity169 affair during the presidency of @entity162			0
" commentary on @entity31 's ethnic reasons for standing by her man ignores the fact that her white boss @entity132 did the same # @entity33 , " @ @entity175 posted to @entity72			1
@entity177 author and novelist @entity176 tweeted : " @entity27 : @entity31 stands by @entity33 because she was raised in @entity35			1
remind me , where was @entity132 raised ? "			0

@entity102 and the @entity28 come under fire for ethnic slant
