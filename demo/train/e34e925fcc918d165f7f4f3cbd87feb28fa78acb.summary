-- a @entity2 campaign app went viral because it urged people to stand " with @entity2 " for " a @entity4			1
" an easy typo to make , but , you know , almost all typos are easy to make			2
there might be some irony here , given the comment @entity2 made to the @entity11 in april : " frankly , in some of the new media , i find myself missing the presence of editors to exercise quality control			1
" @entity2 , like so many others , needs a copy editor			1
and @entity2 , like so many others , is apparently working without one			2
people reading newspapers and news sites can empathize			2
they 're seeing lots of typos , as well as errors of grammar , fact and logic â € ” many more than they would have seen before news organizations decided that they did not need so many copy editors			1
no other job classification has suffered so many losses as the news business downsizes ( except , perhaps , for classified ad takers , who have been craigsdelisted )			2
although it is anecdotal that there are more errors , the evidence is certainly there : at the @entity45 , @entity42 blogs regularly about all those who need a copy editor			1
sadly , there 's no shortage of material , in news reports and beyond			2
typos can be funny : who would n't want to graduate from the @entity52 ? though , if the stories are true , his predecessor had a lot more pubic affairs than @entity57 did			0
while we 're in the nether regions , look at the second photograph in the gallery above			0
how about a martini from this @entity64 restaurant ? do n't see it ? look closely at the ingredient after " @entity67			0
" ( all together now : " ewwwww ! " ) other photos in the gallery show that everyone needs an editor			0
@entity73 's @entity72 needed one when a story about a viral video marriage proposal was identified as " the @entity76			0
" @entity77 needed one when the information on a box that was supposed to be in @entity80 read " @entity80 here " instead			0
and , yes , @entity0 sometimes needs editors , as you can see in a news ticker on a breaking news story that said " yujyujyujyujyuj ... " and the @entity87 , where i worked for 25 years , has copy editors but seems to need them online			1
" @entity90 " as " moron " in a headline ? it happened			0
copy editors provide a safety net for a publication , catching most of the problematic stuff dropped from above			1
they are a curious breed : trivia experts , steeped in popular culture ( helpful for pun headlines , none of which @entity104 gets ) , usually voracious readers , often unappreciated			0
a copy editor 's work is largely invisible , until she misses something , in which case she takes the blame			1
but most important is that a copy editor stands in for the reader , gingerly reshaping , clarifying and correcting things before the reader can see them and post an excoriating comment			1
but more and more publications are laying off their copy editors , replacing them with web designers or more reporters , or with nothing			1
or they 're consolidating copy editors ( and designers ) in " hubs " far away from their audiences , where they ca n't catch a reporter who misspells @entity131 's name as @entity132			1
websites , even those of print or broadcast properties , often have no one			0
one site that specializes in gossip originally had a copy editor but laid her off , one of its editors told me , " because she just slowed things down			1
" sorry , but would the world even know if that story on the pregnancy of ( celebrity name here ) was posted a minute later because someone had to correct the number of kids already borne by ( celebrity name here ) ? " @entity156 first " often translates as " show the reader the finger			0
" so why are so many news organizations giving up on copy editors ? money , of course			1
given the choice between having to give up reporters or give up copy editors , reporters will win nearly every time because they provide " content			1
" by the way , did n't we once call it " information " ? " content " sounds so ... commercial			0
copy editors " merely " prepare content , some publishers say , and do n't we have web editors to do that ? yes , but many do n't have the training or inclination -- or time -- to pay attention to the content			1
their main role is to drive traffic to the site , even if the content is bad			0
one reason given for eliminating copy editors is that reporters can simply " proofread " themselves better			2
but no one can read something he wrote as well as someone else can			0
anyone who 's sent off an email beginning " @entity196 ... " knows that			0
and many reporters simply rely on spell check , witch wont ketch wards spilled rite , butt knot yews wright			0
few publications that are laying off editors are training their remaining staffers to edit themselves better			0
and proofreading is perhaps the least important purpose of copy editing			0
another stated reason for not having copy editors is that readers do n't care about typos			1
if that 's true , why is there so much ridicule about them ? how many comments say things like " where were the editors ? " besides , emerging research shows that readers view edited news more positively than they view unedited news			1
perhaps the most misguided reason for not having copy editors is " reader engagement			2
" after all , readers will spot mistakes , which then can be corrected quickly			0
yes , it is a great advantage to be able to correct things quickly , but is n't it a greater advantage to not make the mistake in the first place , rather than have it ricochet around the @entity236 , and have readers think less of your publication ? can you name one other business whose quality control consists of " well , we 'll just send it into the market and see who complains " ? if another consumer brand did that , there would be lawsuits			2
copy editors are the quality control experts			1
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity254 .			2

@entity254 : a copy editor would have fixed the " @entity4 " typo in @entity2 's app
@entity254 : *newsrooms* mistakenly fire copy editors to save money , and quality sinks
she says readers complain of typos , grammatical errors and ridicule the media
@entity254 says news is taken more seriously when it 's polished by copy editors
