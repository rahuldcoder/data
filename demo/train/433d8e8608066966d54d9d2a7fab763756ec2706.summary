@entity0 , @entity1 -- they filled the grounds in front of the collapsed cathedral in @entity1 's capital			1
wednesday marked the first anniversary of the earthquake that changed the face of a nation			1
more than 200,000 people perished last january 12 when the earth shook violently for a few seconds			2
houses toppled , swallowing residents alive			2
government offices and landmark buildings , including the @entity19 cathedral , came tumbling down			1
five days ago , three more bodies were pulled from the rubble in central @entity0			1
@entity1 still come to pray at the cathedral every sunday			1
on this day , the crowds overwhelmed the small park in front			2
people embraced one another and cried openly			2
there was no reason to hide the sorrow that pervades their lives every day			2
in one neighborhood , a man woke up residents as he walked through the streets at dawn			2
he carried a @entity38 and recited prayers			2
faith is all that many @entity1 have left			1
for the rest of the world , january 12 is a day to mark the horror that unfolded in @entity1			1
but @entity1 must cope with their memories every day			1
@entity46 - @entity45 says she is avoiding watching television on wednesday			2
she does not need reminders			2
instead , she will quietly remember the death of her mother , killed instantly in the quake , and her father , who was rescued after being buried for 16 hours but died a month later			1
@entity45 planned to visit her parents ' tomb with flowers in hand and prayers in her heart			0
and then , she planned to tell a few jokes			0
" why ? because my mother always said , ' when i die , i want you to be happy about it			0
do n't cry all over , ' " she said			0
" i know we have to cry to get rid of the pain			0
but we 're going to make it a little better with these jokes we used to do			0
" at 4:53 p.m. , the time the earthquake hit , @entity1 fell silent to pay homage to the dead -- and to the millions of lives that were forever changed in just a few seconds			1
in some @entity0 neighborhoods , mountains of rubble still stand as they did 12 months ago			1
the hundreds of tent cities that shelter the displaced were supposed to be temporary			0
their continuing existence makes it hard to imagine a year has passed			1
many tent city residents have sadly resigned themselves to permanence in those places of squalor			0
several hundred members of organizing committees for 17 makeshift camps marched wednesday on the streets , determined to cast a spotlight on their plight			0
they carried a sign saying in @entity89 : " if i do n't stand up , i 'm condemned to live in a tent for the rest of my life			0
" the anniversary of the catastrophe , as the @entity1 call it , comes as the @entity97 nation grapples with new crises : a cholera epidemic that has killed more than 3,700 @entity1 and a political impasse sparked by allegations of fraud in a presidential election			1
international monitors from the @entity105 decided to wait until the anniversary passed to hand president @entity107 the results of its election review , which suggests that @entity107 's handpicked successor be eliminated from contention			0
@entity107 has grown increasingly unpopular as many @entity1 perceive the government response to @entity1 's troubles has been inadequate			1
there is a growing tide , too , of criticism of the thousands of aid agencies that operate in the country			1
at the @entity121 in @entity122 , @entity120 ban ki - moon noted that 102 @entity121 personnel died in the earthquake			1
he acknowledged that progress has been slow			0
" @entity1 's streets are still full of rubble , " he said			1
" international aid and investment has not come as quickly as needed or as promised			0
" but , he added , " we are making progress			0
" he said the number of people living in camps is half of what it was at the peak of the emergency , and clean water is being provided to 1 million people , and food to 2 million people			0
" we will help a new government get on its feet and fulfill its responsibilities to its people and , despite the slow start , recovery and reconstruction is finally beginning in earnest			0
" but earthquake survivors like @entity153 wonder why , a year on , nothing has changed in @entity1 , why he has n't seen any of the money the world sent			1
he lost his house and was forced to find shelter in a camp , where his wife , @entity160 , died of disease			0
many people are still suffering , he says			0
" and we do n't know why			0

a year ago , a *massive* earthquake struck @entity1
thousands gather to remember and pray at the cathedral in @entity0
the nation marked a moment of silence
