-- it 's a good thing i did n't know exactly how dangerous a trip i was embarking on , because when i left home in october 2013 to fly to @entity5 , i was scared enough			1
what i had committed to was , quite frankly , the most " impossible " thing i 'd ever tried to accomplish			2
three months earlier , over dinner , i 'd learned about a doctor in @entity5 's @entity11 mountains , dr. @entity12 , who was treating thousands of people -- many of them children -- who 'd had limbs blown off in the @entity20 government 's bombing raids			1
by coincidence , we 'd just posted an article to our website about @entity25 , an amazing inventor who created a low - cost , @entity28 printed prosthetic hand			1
so , over a second beer , i raised the possibility -- would n't it be cool if we brought printers over to @entity5 and made arms for these kids ? the story might have ended there -- one of those plans you cook up over dinner and forget by breakfast			1
really , what can one person do in the face of such widespread sorrow thousands of miles away ? but when i got home and looked up dr. @entity12 , i read about one of the patients he 'd treated : @entity51 -- a 12 - year - old boy who , in attempting to protect himself from an aerial attack , wrapped his arms around a tree			1
the tree protected his body , but both his arms were blown off by the bomb that exploded those few meters away			1
the amputation and hospital treatment had saved his life , but when @entity51 woke and realized what had happened he said he wished he would have died			1
it was one of the most heart - wrenching stories i 'd ever read			1
i looked down the hallway to where my three boys were sleeping and thought , " what if it were my kid ? " what if this happened to them and somebody out there could help them -- and did n't ? in that moment , i realized i could n't just close the computer , get a glass of water and go to bed			2
i had to do something			2
going to @entity5 try to help thousands of people was way too daunting			1
there was no way i could get my head around that			2
i could n't help the many			2
but i could help one			2
crash course in @entity28 printing mind you , at the time i knew very little about @entity28 printing , and even less about prosthetic arms			1
so i did what i always do : surround myself with smart people , shut up , and absorb their brilliance			2
i brought together all the experts -- including the great @entity98 as himself -- to give me a crash course in @entity28 printing and prosthetic arms			1
step 2 : soften orthoplastic in hot water , then wrap it around the patient 's limb to mold the custom - fitted , medical - grade , breathable plastic that will anchor the printed components			2
step 3 : attach the hand and the gauntlet , and thread the cabling through each digit , running it back to an attachment point behind the patient 's wrist or elbow			0
the motion of the wrist ( up and down ) or elbow ( side to side ) then pulls on the cabling and draws the fingers to a close			0
in short , the cables tense and release around a pivot point			0
the crash course done , and just three short months after that initial dinner , i found myself in @entity136 -- a desolate , dusty refugee camp in @entity5 -- a home to 70,000 hungry and desperate people , driven from their homes by bombing campaigns and unimaginable horrors			1
i set up shop in an old toolshed and got ready to make a working mechanical arm			2
despite the heat ( which kept melting the printing filament ) and the bugs ( which kept jamming up the @entity28 printer motors ) , i managed to get the 3 - d printers working and set about making an arm ... for a real boy , now sitting five feet away from me			1
that boy i 'd read about that night in my kitchen back in july			2
meeting @entity51 @entity51 was non-communicative when we first met			1
he stared , sullen and resigned , off into the middle distance			0
i gave him my tablet to play with while i worked , and he did what any other teenager would do : found a video game and started playing			0
only he used his stumps instead of his fingers			0
little by little , he began to trust me and started to show some interest in what i was doing			0
every time i got frustrated , or something was n't working right , i just had to look over at @entity51 and nothing else mattered			1
i had to make it work			0
after a few days , and a few failures , we managed to fit an arm on @entity51			1
he was n't yet strong enough to make the motion that would make the hand clench -- that would come later -- but he could manipulate the hand to his mouth			0
i fitted it with a tin spoon and took him to the mess tent			0
we sat him in front of a bowl of goat and pumpkin stew			0
it was here , for the first time in two years , that @entity51 fed himself			1
he looked over at me and , slowly , a little smirk curled his lips			0
he turned back , looked at the small crowd that had gathered around him , broke into the biggest grin you 'd ever seen , then went back in for more			0
i knew then , that i had stumbled upon something way bigger than myself , bigger than @entity51 , and bigger than that one meal			1
it was the idea that by helping one , you have the potential to help many -- and that might just be the secret to it all			0
the reality , i believe , is that all change starts small			0
the big picture is just too unwieldy , too incomprehensible and seemingly immovable			0
but give us something individual , quantifiable and personalize - able and , suddenly , our perspective shifts to the one			0
when we look at life through the lens of " one , " everything becomes that much more attainable			0
by the end of the week , i was in @entity5 's @entity218 where dr. @entity12 's hospital continues his work			1
with a steady stream of solar power , i gathered a roomful of locals -- some invited , some not -- and taught them how to @entity28 print			1
most of them had never seen a computer before , and none of them had ever seen a 3 - d printer			0
yet , there we were , getting ready to start a hand - making factory , excited about the possibility of making arms for other amputees			2
as i was packing up to leave , we all talked about what we wanted to accomplish			0
we talked about how many limbs we wanted to make , how many people we wanted to help , how many arms we wanted to have done by the time i return			1
" it does n't matter how many we make , " i told them			0
" we 'll get there , eventually			0
" for now , just make one			0
" interactive : how 3 - d printing will reshape the world the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity250 .			1

aged 12 , @entity51 lost both his arms to a bomb in @entity5
@entity255 @entity250 read about his plight and *decided* to help
@entity250 learned how to @entity28 print a new arm for @entity51
he traveled to @entity5 and taught locals to @entity28 print limbs for others
