it 's uncomfortable , talking about death			2
and that 's as true for the profession devoted to staving it off as it is for the rest of us			1
" i learned about a lot of things in medical school , " surgeon @entity9 begins his @entity11 best - selling book , " being @entity12 : medicine and what matters at the end			1
" " but mortality was n't one of them			1
" in his book , @entity9 , a @entity22 professor who practices endocrine surgery at @entity24 in @entity25 , argues that health professionals -- and the rest of us -- need to change how we approach patients ' final days			2
" you do n't have to spend much time with the elderly or those with terminal illness to see how often medicine fails the people it is supposed to help , " he writes			1
" the waning days of our lives are given over to treatments that addle our brains and sap our bodies for a sliver 's chance of benefit			0
" instead , @entity9 proposes embracing death as normal			0
it " may be the enemy , " he writes , " but it is also the natural order of things			0
" it 's not an entirely new concept in modern medicine			0
since the 1990s , the rise of hospice care and similar services has served as a stark acknowledgment that sometimes , quality of life in one 's final days is more important than last - ditch efforts to fight the inevitable			1
but it 's an idea that 's rapidly becoming more pertinent			0
in 2050 , roughly 83.7 million @entity61 will be over 65 -- nearly twice the number from 2012 , according to the @entity63			1
" the projected growth of the older population in the @entity61 will present challenges to policy makers and programs , such as @entity73 and @entity74 , " said a may @entity65 report ( @entity66 ) on the aging population			1
" it will also affect families , businesses , and health care providers			1
" the @entity79 , part of the government 's @entity81 , also emphasizes the importance of non-curative care in a loved one 's final days			2
" when a doctor says something like , ' i 'm afraid the news is not good			0
there are no other treatments for us to try			0
i 'm sorry , ' it may close the door to the possibility of a cure , but it does not end the need for medical support , " says an @entity79 guide on end - of - life care			1
" nor does it end the involvement of family and friends			0
there are many places and a variety of ways to provide care for an older person who is dying			1
such care often involves a team			2
" in his book , @entity9 recalls a cancer patient who , for months , underwent one painful , potentially fatal treatment after another , when doctors knew they 'd almost certainly only cause him more discomfort while prolonging an illness that would never be cured			0
we need to do better , he says			0
" our reluctance to honestly examine the experience of aging and dying has increased the harm we inflict on people , " he writes , " and denied them the basic comforts they most need			2

surgeon wants us to think again about care for the dying
he says the medical profession is n't trained to embrace the inevitable
by 2050 , 83 million @entity61 will be older than 65
