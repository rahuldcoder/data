the recent op - ed by @entity1 and @entity2 is yet another attempt to stymie and shackle @entity4 and international negotiators in ongoing talks about @entity4 's peaceful nuclear program			1
@entity4 should be able to enjoy its right to peaceful nuclear energy while avoiding further hostilities and instability			1
particularly illogical is their joining in the decades - old rhetoric , comparing who they see as their foe -- @entity4 -- to @entity17			1
their view of the diplomatic path is misguided			2
their attempt to compare the @entity4 government to the murderous @entity24 is ludicrous , counterproductive and unfortunate			1
the @entity17 analogy has a long and tortured history			1
for many decades , those seeking to circumvent peaceful conflict resolution have resorted to the crude @entity17 analogy , comparing others to the hideous ruler			1
@entity1 and @entity2 affirmed comparisons of @entity34 president @entity33 to @entity17 earlier in the same article			1
but their comparisons to @entity17 carry some insidious inferences			1
they say that since @entity17 's claim that he desired peace was a lie , @entity4 's claims to want peace can not be believed			1
therefore diplomacy in general ca n't happen and thus nations are locked in a policy of continuous war and aggression			0
they also seek to undermine any constructive debate about policy , and instead have the public and policy makers act out of sheer panic rather than thoughtful statesmanship			0
those favoring a rush to hostility have always used the @entity17 comparison to circumvent sensible deliberation and intimidate others			1
they want nations to support the impulsive use of force at times when they know using force is the wrong path and that diplomacy is best for national and global security			0
this is not to say that there are n't many valuable lessons to be learned from the failure to quickly confront the menace of the @entity24			1
the world should not have stood by as @entity17 invaded his neighbors			2
@entity4 , by contrast , has not invaded any of its neighbors over the past 250 years			2
thus , comparing @entity4 to @entity24 is illogical and should be condemned for the sake of peace and global security			1
the current efforts by the @entity4 government to reach a diplomatic resolution on the nuclear file is not a tactic but , as many independent observers have noted , reflects its will to compromise and re-engage the world with mutual respect and the peaceful resolution of conflict			1
president @entity96 , who won an election that had a voter turnout of 73 % , campaigned on the platform of reaching understanding with the @entity101 on a number of issues , including the nuclear file			2
that is the basis of @entity4 's current policy			2
@entity1 and @entity2 also recommend president @entity108 support efforts by some in @entity110 to pass new sanctions			0
but those sanctions would violate the terms of the interim agreement , or at the very least , impose the strictest possible parameters on the @entity116 negotiators			0
those parameters would either significantly harm sensitive international negotiations or derail the process altogether			0
also , the interim accord reached in @entity120 is a very transparent agreement based on verification as well as strict inspections , so both sides feel assured as they seek a final status agreement			0
@entity1 and @entity2 also point to a poll commissioned by @entity2 that they claim indicates popular support for their perception of @entity4			1
it 's worth noting that neither @entity2 nor the conservative polling firm have disclosed the full results of the poll or their methodology			0
but even if this poll was to be given weight , the spread of this extremely negative perception of @entity4 among some in the @entity116 public -- championed by people like the authors -- is not a logical rationalization			2
additionally , if we are to look at polls , numerous ones published by major nonpartisan polling firms show strong support for diplomacy among the @entity116 people , according to some by a 2 - to - 1 margin			0
for example in a @entity156 / @entity155 , three out of four @entity116 support diplomacy over conflict , including 87 % of @entity159 and 68 % of @entity160			0
@entity2 is a former @entity161 official			2
@entity161 prime minister @entity163 's complete opposition to any peaceful solution has been on full display since the potential of diplomatic conflict resolution became apparent			2
@entity1 's attempt to put out hawkish statement is understandable in light of his electoral ambitions			0
but since global security is on the line , the decisions that guide this process should not be made based on political posturing or hysteria			0
and they should not give outsized consideration to the overzealous hyperbole of those who reflexively oppose diplomacy , who still consider the @entity184 boondoggle a prudent war			0
they should rather be made with meticulous consideration of the national interests and with an eye -- and cautious optimism -- toward a negotiated settlement that could relieve tensions and even a reversal of the current dynamic of hostility			0
join us on @entity198 / @entity197 .			0

@entity4 official @entity200 fires back at recent claims comparing @entity4 to @entity24
@entity200 : @entity4 should be able to enjoy its right to peaceful nuclear energy
the @entity17 analogy , he says , has a long and tortured history and is off point in this case
