-- @entity2 's trip to @entity3 -- the first visit by a @entity6 secretary of state in half a century -- is poised to produce a breakthrough moment in @entity6 - @entity3 relations			1
some worry that such a high - level visit is premature			0
given that government 's long history of authoritarian rule and systematic violations of human rights , vigilance is in order			1
but , to its credit , the @entity19 administration understands that this is not the time to stand on the sidelines and wait for change to happen			0
how this transition plays out in @entity3 , historically known as @entity3 , is a story that has n't been written yet			0
the @entity6 should actively test the new government 's credibility and commitment to reform and do all that it can to encourage , prod , and push for positive change			1
the pace of change in @entity3 over recent months has stunned even the most skeptical observers			2
following deeply flawed elections one year ago , the shift from a ruling junta to a nominally civilian government has led to democracy leader @entity39 's release from house arrest and the official return of her party , the @entity42 ( @entity42 ) , to the political scene			0
her meetings with president @entity45 represent a welcome signal that @entity3 's new government is reaching out to its opponents			1
the @entity42 recently announced that @entity39 would likely run for @entity49			0
other " flickers of progress , " as president @entity19 put it , are also under way			0
the government has created a nominally independent human rights body , invited the @entity56 to engage in dialogue on currency reforms , called on armed ethnic groups to hold peace talks and lifted some restrictions on the media			0
while the recent release of 200 or so activists falls far short of the estimated 2,100 political prisoners believed to be languishing in @entity3 jails , it 's a movement that should be further pushed			2
so far , the @entity6 government has responded by lifting travel restrictions on some officials -- including @entity71 , @entity3 's foreign minister , who met with @entity6 officials in @entity73 and @entity74 in september and on the margins of the @entity77 meeting in @entity78 earlier in november			1
@entity79 , the @entity6 special envoy to @entity3 , has visited the @entity81 nation twice during the past two months @entity83 's visit represents the clearest signal yet that the @entity19 administration is ready to begin a new era in @entity6 - @entity3 relations			1
the visit is also a strong signal to @entity90 that the @entity6 is seeking to contain @entity92 's influence in @entity3			1
while the @entity6 sanctioned itself out of playing a role in resource - rich @entity3 over the past few decades , @entity90 has been aggressively pursuing its commercial interests , and today @entity90 is the country 's main trading partner and arms supplier			1
but @entity3 's recent decision to suspend the construction of the controversial @entity100 project , which was to provide electricity to @entity90 , is a strong indication that the government is ready to say no to @entity90 when it is in its interest to do so			2
@entity83 's visit to @entity3 , which comes on the heels of @entity19 's recent @entity81 tour that culminated at the @entity108 in @entity109 , also represents a reassertion of @entity6 leadership in the wider @entity112			1
while in @entity112 , @entity19 shored up trade , diplomatic and military interests in the region , announced plans to station @entity6 troops in @entity118 and pursued a multilateral approach to resolving territorial and energy disputes in the @entity121 -- a set of issues that @entity92 prefers to deal with bilaterally			2
re-engaging @entity3 is part of this strategic reorientation			0
@entity6 - @entity3 re-engagement could open the way to clarifying the military 's nuclear ambitions , which have become all the more disturbing in light of @entity6 sen. @entity132 's recent disclosure that he received information several years ago that @entity3 's government planned to develop nuclear weapons with @entity137 's assistance			1
while in @entity3 , @entity83 should vigorously press leaders to allow the visit of an @entity140 ( @entity140 ) fact - finding team to investigate any questions related to nuclear cooperation from @entity144 and sign on to the voluntary @entity145 , a safeguards agreement that would provide @entity140 greater rights of access			2
an expansion in official @entity6 - @entity3 ties also could help to address a range of issues beyond @entity3 's internal situation			1
the nation is the source of a number of transnational concerns related to instability and conflict along its borders as a result of military efforts to rein in insurgent groups , as well as the continuing export of disease and refugees			0
@entity3 's porous borders , combined with its status as the second - largest opium poppy grower in the world after @entity170 , have allowed for rampant drug smuggling throughout and beyond @entity112			0
the recent endorsement by the @entity173 of @entity3 's bid to assume the chairmanship of the regional grouping in 2014 offers a significant point of leverage			0
the @entity6 would be well - served to coordinate its policies toward @entity3 with @entity173 governments to ensure that leaders in the capital of @entity183 enact meaningful reforms that bring about national reconciliation and improve the everyday lives of the @entity3 people			2
with a per capita gross domestic product ( gdp ) between $ 1 to $ 3 a day , the conditions in @entity3 are among the most dire of any country			0
this moment of change is an opportunity to help move @entity3 away from authoritarian rule and into the world community			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			0

@entity2 's trip to @entity3 could be a breakthrough , says @entity199

this moment is a chance to help move @entity3 away from authoritarian rule , says @entity199
