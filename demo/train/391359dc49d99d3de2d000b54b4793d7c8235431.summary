-- love or hate @entity2 , you probably do n't expect this sort of message from one of the largest and most innovative @entity7 and technology companies in the world : " the @entity13 app we launched today contained a bug with notifications , " the company wrote wednesday on @entity11			1
" we have pulled the app to fix the problem			2
" that 's just one of the ways @entity2 screwed up this week , according to tech pundits and bloggers			1
the company also released an update to @entity25 that was described by a former employee as " a disaster			2
" " maybe @entity2 is n't so invincible after all , " the site @entity29 asked			1
the complaints raise two deeper issues about @entity2 : first is the long - aired gripe that the company develops cooler and better - functioning smartphone apps for @entity36 devices than it does for @entity38 's @entity37			1
after all , @entity2 created @entity36 , and has a business interest in seeing that smartphone platform succeed over that of its competitors			1
the new @entity46 app , however , is raising questions about the company 's ability to put out apps that -- at the very least -- will function on @entity38 devices			1
" the real question here is how were these problems not caught during testing , either on @entity2 's part or @entity38 's ? ( conspiracy theory : @entity38 did catch the errors , but approved the app anyway ) , " the blog @entity53 wrote			1
second , this week 's botched @entity46 app for @entity13 digs at @entity2 's image as an innovative company			1
if @entity2 keeps releasing disappointing products , people may stop being excited about the company as a whole , @entity65 , a tech pundit , wrote on his personal blog			1
" they release something , and i no longer have any faith that it 's going to be any good , " @entity65 wrote on wednesday in a post titled " @entity72			2
" " it 's hard to get excited about a company like that			0
it 's the same reason why it 's hard to get excited when @entity81 and @entity82 release new things			0
the track record just is n't there any more			0
" this week 's controversy follows several less - than - thrilling product launches from @entity2			1
@entity89 , the company 's effort to compete with @entity91 , has seen its traffic plunge			0
other @entity2 products , from @entity94 to @entity95 , never became break - out successes			2
and that 's not to mention @entity98 , @entity99 and @entity100 , which the company killed			0
@entity2 has had trouble with the functionality of its @entity13 apps , in particular			1
" previously , the company pulled its @entity109 app from the @entity110 because of continuous crashing in @entity37 , " the site @entity106 says			1
" @entity2 also had to fix several bugs in its @entity114 app a few months ago , but never removed the app from the store			1
given @entity2 's tendency to release products in beta form , these are n't huge surprises			2
" others are less forgiving			0
" given the size and importance of the company , it 's a joke really			0
yes , they have @entity36 , which they are clearly going to favor over @entity38 's rival mobile platform , but come on , " @entity65 wrote			0
" when you release sub-par products , you look sub-par yourself			0
customers do n't care what platform it 's on , and do n't care what politics are going on behind the scenes at the company			0
if you release s --- , you look like s ---			0
it 's much better to release nothing at all			0
" tech pundits also piled criticism on the new version of @entity25 , which includes integration with the company 's social network but is n't considered to be as aesthetically pleasing			2
" someone took the magic color - removing wand and drenched the whole page in grey , " wrote @entity152 , who is a former product manager for @entity25			0
" it 's so unbelievably stark , it 's hard to imagine a more desolate experience			0
" " there 's almost no way @entity2 could have blundered more disastrously here , " writes @entity161			2
it seems the only thing @entity2 can get right this week is a pumpkin - carving video			2
if you 've taken a look at the new @entity25 or the @entity46 app , let us know what you think in the comments			1
to be sure , not all reviews are as scathing as those quoted here .			0

@entity2 launches @entity46 app for @entity13 that barely functions
@entity179 pulls the app from the @entity110 , says " we messed up "
a *redesign* of @entity2 reader also has been *declared* a " disaster "
tech pundit says @entity2 has lost its innovative mojo
