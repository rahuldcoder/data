@entity1 , @entity2 @entity0 does n't want to be judged by the clothes she wears , by the religion she follows or , least of all , by where she grew up			1
but @entity7 , raised by immigrants from @entity9 in the @entity11 suburb of @entity12 , says it 's as if her neighborhood is stamped across her forehead			1
" it 's hard to dream when everyone says the place you come from only spawns ' jihadists , terrorists and delinquents , ' " the 21 - year - old says			2
" you end up feeling completely isolated			0
" @entity12 is just one of the many banlieues -- heavily immigrant , working class suburbs -- dotted around the periphery of the @entity2 capital			1
but its close proximity to @entity1 has made the neighborhood synonymous with violence and failure			1
@entity1 is the hometown of @entity34 , who killed a policewoman as well as four hostages at a kosher supermarket in @entity11 two weeks ago			1
his associates said and @entity39 slaughtered 12 more at the office of the satirical magazine @entity41			1
together they are the worst terror attacks in @entity2 in decades			1
@entity7 's concerns were exacerbated this week when @entity2 prime minister @entity44 declared that there was a " geographic , social and ethnic apartheid " that had developed in @entity2			1
she believes the use of provocative language only further alienates the people living in the banlieues			2
@entity7 says that the past two weeks have attracted a relentless and unwelcome media spotlight on @entity12 , with journalists descending en masse and filming from their cars for fear of being assaulted or having their equipment stolen			0
the negative press has dredged up many prejudices and cultural stereotypes that @entity7 has spent most of her young life fighting to dispel -- ever since the 2005 riots that left thousands of cars burnt in the @entity11 region , thousands arrested and millions more traumatized across @entity2			1
" yes , we need better education and , yes , delinquency exists in these towns , but the government tarnishes us all with the same brush			2
you stop feeling like an individual and begin to think you 're reduced to a crime - ridden town , " @entity7 says			0
@entity7 believes the media perpetuates certain cliches about towns like hers -- especially the one about how banlieues are full of " bad apples			2
" it 's a sentiment shared by @entity34 's sister , @entity82 -- now a successful dancer -- who reflected on the 2005 riots in a 2009 interview with the @entity85			1
" when you are in the projects , they want you to shut your mouth , to stay here , to grow up complacent			0
for me , the way that people in the projects are portrayed so negatively in the media really hurt me a lot , " @entity82 told the paper			0
but @entity96 , the mayor of @entity1 , is trying to shatter this image of banlieues as crime - wracked ghettos			1
@entity100 grew up in the concrete maze that is the @entity102 -- the same housing project as @entity34			1
@entity100 says it 's easy to overlook the success stories of the banlieues in favor of tales of homegrown terrorists , but that not everyone from his town is a criminal			1
" @entity1 was home to a professional football player , an actress , even a patisserie chef who now works in @entity115 , " he says			1
" these are all very successful people			0
" in the same breath , the mayor admits that his town faces grave economic problems			0
forty percent of @entity102 residents aged 16 - 25 are unemployed			2
the average net annual income in @entity1 is 9,600 euros , according to @entity100 -- the lowest in the @entity11 region			1
these factors make it very difficult for those who live in the area to feel like they 're part of society , the mayor says			2
@entity100 has been waging a campaign to get a fully staffed police station for the town 's 30,000 inhabitants			0
but the @entity135 has yet to grant his wish			0
the mayor also believes that better education will help bridge the gap between the banlieues and the state , the " us and them " mentality			0
@entity145 , a schoolteacher in the eastern @entity11 suburb of @entity147 , has a class largely made up of second and third generation immigrant children			1
a man with a calm demeanor , he believes opening a dialogue with his students on the theme of identity in @entity2 is crucial to helping his students find their place within the state			1
his main worry is what happens when they leave school and begin job hunting			0
" because they struggle to find a job , they feel disinherited , stigmatized , and suddenly these young adults ca n't find their role in the workplace and therefore they create their own communities , " he says			0
@entity171 was @entity34 's social worker			1
his small office in @entity102 is littered with photos of smiling children that he has helped guide into adulthood			0
@entity171 believes one of the reasons @entity34 might have formed a relationship with hardened criminals when he was in jail was because he did n't fit into life outside the prison walls , despite desperately wanting to be part of a community			1
" [ @entity34 ] had a big problem with identity , he was lost			2
and prison offered him some bad examples to follow , " @entity171 says			0
@entity34 's cousin @entity190 agrees			1
" he befriended a bunch of idiots and became himself an idiot , " @entity190 told @entity2 radio @entity191			2
" he did not hate @entity196 , @entity197 , it 's the state he hated			0
" connecting the disaffected youth to the state through job creation is what @entity202 has dedicated the last 6 years to			0
the business he founded , the @entity204 in @entity205 , strives to " reveal the untapped potential of doing business with undeserved entrepreneurs in marginalized neighborhoods			0
" @entity202 says the negative publicity surrounding the banlieues means companies shy away from recruiting there -- and in turn , this further antagonizes the people of these towns			2
" we feel like we 're alone , and when we talk about the banlieues we only talk about its problems and never about the opportunity the banlieues represent today , " @entity202 says			2
" that is crucial to bringing everyone together			0
" in the meantime , @entity0 is hoping opportunity will come knocking as she pursues an internship this summer			0
her dream is a career in journalism , but she knows that ambition alone may not be enough			0
" to have a future you need to believe in yourself , but you also need others to believe in you , " she says .			0
