@entity1 , @entity0 -- the first coffeehouse to open in @entity0 , a still - operating caf√© on @entity4 in @entity1 , is more than a place to get a beef and horseradish sandwich , according to author and blogger @entity8			1
it represents a turning point in western culture that helped usher in nearly 500 years of scientific and cultural progress			2
the reason : until coffee and tea became popular , " alcohol was the daytime drink of choice , " he told the @entity17 conference in @entity1 on tuesday			1
water was n't safe to drink , so wine , beer or gin was a better choice for breakfast , lunch and dinner			2
" until the rise of the coffeehouse , the entire population was effectively drunk all day , " @entity8 said in a talk aimed at explaining how ideas get started			1
" if you switched from a depressant to a stimulant in your life , you would have better ideas			2
" moreover , the setting of a coffeehouse , which encourages the mixing of people from different backgrounds , is perfect for sharing and crafting innovative thoughts			0
" an astonishing number of innovations have a coffeehouse somewhere in their story , " he said			0
great ideas often do n't result from a single " eureka " moment , but instead come from what @entity8 called " the slow hunch , " as they evolve and interact with other ideas			1
he traced the development of gps technology , starting in the 1950s with efforts by @entity65 scientists to track the @entity68 @entity67 spacecraft			0
and that same gps technology now can help you find a nearby coffeehouse that will serve you a soy latte , @entity8 joked			1
mixing and sharing ideas was one of the themes of the opening speakers at @entity17 , where the theme is " and now the @entity78			1
" @entity79 , author of " the @entity80 , " says the sharing of ideas -- or in his phrase , " ideas having sex with each other " -- is a tremendously powerful force driving human progress			1
watch @entity79 's talk at @entity17 exchanging ideas allows tremendous specialization of labor , to the point where no single person can fully understand what it takes to create an object as complex as a computer mouse , which relies on the efforts of millions in industries as diverse as the oil industry that creates the plastics to the coffeehouse that supplies a drink to the product 's designer			1
" we 've created something called the collective brain , " @entity79 said			1
" we 're just the nodes , the neurons in the brain ... " " as we go forward , we will of course experience terrible things			2
there will be wars , there will be natural disasters ... but because of the connections people are making and the ability of ideas to meet and mate as never before , i 'm also sure that living standards will advance ... we are surely accelerating the rate of innovation			1
" a tripling of the productivity of agricultural land in past decades has saved some of the tropical rainforest and @entity79 predicted that rainforests could start increasing in the second half of the century as the human population peaks and starts to decline			1
other ideas were mixing and mating in @entity1 at the first day of @entity17 , which is a product of the nonprofit @entity17 , dedicated to " ideas worth spreading			1
" it holds conferences and makes videos of its speakers available at @entity144 /			2
[ @entity2 partners with @entity17 to present a @entity17 every week , with added content , on @entity2 ] among the ideas were these : @entity149 's rise not a cause for fear @entity152 of @entity153 , the influential thinker and former assistant defense secretary , cautioned against equating the rise of @entity149 and @entity157 with the decline of @entity159 and the @entity160			1
he pointed to recurrent and groundless fears of @entity159 decline over the past 50 years and noted that in the larger story of history , @entity157 is regaining influence that it had 200 years ago , before the @entity167			0
@entity149 's gain does n't have to be the @entity160 's loss : " if @entity149 develops greater energy security and greater capacity to deal with carbon emissions , that 's good for us , " @entity152 said			2
cause of the 21st century : ending oppression of women @entity177 , the author of " @entity178 " with her husband , @entity179 , said the 19th century 's central moral challenge was ending slavery , the 20th century 's was ending totalitarianism and this century must be about freeing and empowering women			0
" more girls have been discriminated to death " in past decades , she said , than people killed on the battlefields of the 20th century			0
educating girls and bringing them into the work force limits population growth , since educated women tend to have significantly fewer children			0
she told the story of an aid worker who saw horrible things happen in @entity196 without breaking down			2
in the backyard of the woman 's grandmother , back in the @entity159 , she saw a bird feeder and broke down in tears			0
" we have the great fortune to be born in a country where we take security for granted , " she said , and we can feed and house ourselves and even put out food so wild birds wo n't starve in the winter			1
@entity159 and those in other @entity65 countries " have all won the lottery of life , " and have an obligation to help people throughout the world			0
strength of a nation is n't how much it can produce @entity218 , founder of the @entity219 for well - being at the @entity220 in @entity221 , said all the daily measures people hear in the news relating to stock prices , exchange rates and gross domestic product emphasize greed without tapping into human happiness			1
" our national accounting system became fixated on what we can produce , " @entity218 said , quoting @entity230 's famous statement that " the gross national product measures everything except that which makes life worthwhile			0
" " how crazy is that ? " @entity218 said			0
surveys show people want happiness , love and health more than they want wealth			2
" these are natural human aspirations , why are statisticians not measuring that , instead of being fixated on how much stuff we have ? " the liberating power of cartoons @entity249 , an editorial cartoonist based in @entity250 , picked up on the theme of questionable consumerism by showing a cartoon of @entity254 making a pitch for the @entity256 : " it 'll simplify a lot of tasks you never had to do before			2
" a man sees a newspaper vendor 's poster : " print media is dying , " and says " i already read that on the internet yesterday			0
" the punchline of another cartoon : " the internet has changed music			0
before we had to go to the store to steal it			0
and yet another , showing a confessional as someone behind a curtain says " @entity276 , i 've sinned , " and the priest , googling the parishioner on a computer screen says , " i know			0
" cartoons are in the middle of a clash of civilizations , @entity249 said , as free expression collides with those who want to enforce religious orthodoxy around the world			0
for dictators around the world , he said , " good news is when cartoonists , activists and journalists shut up			0
" and when their ideas stop having sex .			1

speakers at @entity17 conference in @entity1 stress connections between ideas
@entity79 : ideas " have sex , " *multiplying* their value and driving up living standards
@entity8 : great ideas are n't born *overnight* but evolve over time
human happiness is not about producing and acquiring more things , they say
