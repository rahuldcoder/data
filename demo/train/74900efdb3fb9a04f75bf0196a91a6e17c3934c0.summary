editor 's note : this article was originally published on august 29 , 2013			1
( @entity3 ) -- for most people it starts with a telltale , bulls - eye rash and flu - like symptoms			1
it then develops into neurological problems , such as numbness in the limbs or facial paralysis , leaving the patient in excruciating pain			1
about 300,000 @entity16 each year are infected with @entity17 , according to the @entity18			1
that number , the @entity18 reported last week , is about 10 times higher than they had previously estimated			1
but what if you never get the rash ? what if you blow off your symptoms as a bad case of the flu ? i spent the first 30 years of my life in @entity30 , where talk about @entity17 was prevalent			1
when i was little my mother would have us slather on the @entity34 before we went outside made sure we had long pants and socks on , especially when we 'd play in the woods			0
she 'd check us for ticks and remove any she found with a match and tweezers			1
problem solved -- no rash , good to go			0
buzz off , bugs ! how to stay safe during insect season then in 2006 i moved to @entity45 , and @entity17 faded from my mind			1
common in the @entity48 , lyme disease is found less often in the @entity49			1
the year i arrived , eight cases were reported in @entity51 , compared to 1,788 in my home state of @entity53			2
i am now one of the cases for 2013			0
at least once a week , my muscles start to twitch uncontrollably ; they tighten so much my fingers turn into fists			0
i can feel my fingernails digging through my skin			0
my heart races out of control and my blood pressure skyrockets			0
my doctor holds me down , consoling me , telling me to breathe because he has no idea what 's going on			2
my face is numb , and it feels like i have the flu			0
the pain is so bad i start to cry			2
a few years ago i noticed a pain radiating down my leg , starting from the small of my back			1
i had had artificial disc surgery in my spine a couple years prior and thought this new pain was due to scar tissue from the surgery			1
then i went to work one day and lost all feeling in my legs			0
my arms were tingling and it felt like i had pins and needles everywhere in my body			0
i went to the @entity85 , and that night , i became a medical mystery			0
i had a full body @entity88 ( the first of many ) and by the end of the night i had seen at least five neurologists			0
they chalked it up to my previously damaged spine , gave me some painkillers and sent me on my way			0
this sequence of events would continue for another two years			2
each time the diagnosis would change , but the end result would stay the same			2
i saw a neurologist , a neurosurgeon , an orthopedic surgeon , a urologist , a neuro - urologist , a kidney specialist , three different pain doctors and a pain psychologist			2
my diagnoses varied from heart disease to polycystic kidney disease to @entity113			2
i had many different neurologic disorders -- fibromyalgia , psychosomatic disorder and my personal favorite , neurosyphilis -- according to these doctors			0
i had multiple brain @entity88 that revealed lesions in my brain ; these were due to my high blood pressure , the doctors told me			0
i continued to get little headaches that would come , last for a minute and disappear			0
my legs would lose feeling and everyday it seemed like i was getting weaker			0
i would get @entity129 's palsy -- a syndrome where part of my face would be paralyzed and slump to one side			2
my body would twitch uncontrollably , and then tighten up to the point where i thought my bones would break			0
i was told my pain was all in my head , that it was n't real			2
why you should be afraid of lyme disease i should have been thinking about @entity17			1
i know several friends and family members who have contracted the disease			2
but i had moved to @entity49			1
i did n't think i had been bitten by a tick			0
still , research about my symptoms online showed late stage lyme disease made sense			1
during an appointment with my neurologist last month , after another trip to the emergency room , i asked : what about @entity17 ? they tested my blood , and three days later the results came back positive			1
had i only thought of it earlier , or had my doctors only thought of it earlier , the bacteria that manifests itself as the disease could have been eradicated			2
in the medical community , chronic lyme disease is a controversial diagnosis			1
lyme disease is usually treated with medication for no longer than 28 days			1
but for some , even when the bacteria that causes the disease is gone , the symptoms still remain			1
the @entity18 calls it post-treatment lyme disease syndrome			1
" approximately 10 to 20 % of patients treated for @entity17 with a recommended 2 - 4 week course of antibiotics will have lingering symptoms of fatigue , pain , or joint and muscle aches , " its website states			1
" most medical experts believe that the lingering symptoms are the result of residual damage to tissues and the immune system that occurred during the infection			1
" the @entity18 goes on to say that no studies have proven antibiotic treatment past three to four weeks leads to any improvement in the patient			0
since there is still so much we do n't know about the disease , the controversy ensues			0
in the next few months , i will see what relief my treatment will bring			0
my only hope is that by sharing my story , others wo n't suffer the same fate as me .			0
