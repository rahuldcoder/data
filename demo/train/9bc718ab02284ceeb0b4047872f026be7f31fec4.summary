-- maybe you had one as a kid , or knew someone who did			0
it 's the iconic little red wagon with the @entity7 logo			1
@entity7 is developing a prototype of a wagon with digital controls and an mp3 player dock			1
if so , you might not recognize the newest product dreamed up by the brain trust at @entity7 's @entity14 , @entity15 , headquarters			1
this wagon , called the cloud 9 , is equipped with enough high - tech bells and whistles to make the family minivan jealous			1
" we approached this product much like an automotive company might with a concept car , " said @entity20 , @entity7 's product development manager			1
outfitted with 5 - point safety harnesses , padded seats , cup holders , foot brakes and fold - out storage containers , the sleek , curved cloud 9 has every family covered for a ride through the park			1
but that 's just for starters			0
there 's a digital handle that tracks temperature , time , distance and speed -- just in case energetic parents want to track their split times around the playground			2
and there 's a slot for an mp3 player , complete with speakers , for some cruising tunes			1
that 's right : the little red wagon has gone 2.0			2
" music is such an important part of kids ' and families ' lives , we thought it would be great to have a speaker system built in the wagon , " said @entity51 , vice president of product development			2
the cloud 9 is still a prototype , but it was n't developed on a whim			1
the company did extensive market research beforehand , then tested it out on the real experts at home			1
" we sit down [ and ] observe how moms and kids are using our products , " said @entity51			0
" that 's where our new ideas come from			0
" to develop those ideas , @entity7 's designers are using state - of - the art technology			1
they use @entity79 graphic tablets , allowing them to draw directly onto digital renderings of new products			0
and @entity7 also has its own in - house computer numerical control , or @entity85 , machines that create prototypes right on site			2
@entity7 's blend of cutting - edge design and old - fashioned products appears to be a successful recipe			1
in an economy where businesses and families alike are tightening their belts , the company is still going strong			0
" @entity7 survived the @entity98 , and this year has been a difficult year for a lot of companies , " @entity51 says , " but @entity7 is actually growing this year			2
we 're actually looking for engineers and designers in our product development group to keep up with the growth of the company			0
" that 's quite a testament for a company nearly 90 years old			0
theirs is an @entity109 success story that started when @entity111 immigrant @entity110 started building wooden toy wagons in 1917			1
he had limited success but was encouraged enough to start the @entity114 in 1923			0
the company changed names seven years later , becoming @entity117			0
the world was introduced that same year to the first steel wagon , called the @entity7			2
since then , @entity7 has become perhaps the world 's most famous maker of wagons , tricycles and other toys			1
the company 's best - known product even inspired a 1992 movie , " @entity7 , " about a boy who imagines converting his red wagon into a flying machine to help his little brother flee an abusive stepdad			1
whether you grew up on @entity136 - ' em robots or @entity137 , the little red wagon has remained a mainstay of child 's play			2
it 's certainly evolved over the years , though -- the rusty metal has been replaced with plastic			0
but the spirit of @entity7 , which conjures memories of a simpler time , remains intact			0
" one of the most important things about @entity7 products is that they really help [ keep kids active outdoors ] , " @entity51 said			0
" so when we 're designing our products , we 're really looking at how can we get kids outside and playing , away from the video games and tv screens and computer screens			0
" @entity0 's @entity154 contributed to this story .			0
