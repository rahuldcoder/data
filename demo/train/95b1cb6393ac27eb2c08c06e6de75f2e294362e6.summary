-- during a protest in @entity6 's @entity5 a month after the fall of president @entity3 , @entity1 spotted a slogan supporting womens ' right to be president of @entity11			1
she said : " at that moment , i thought we should n't just be saying that , we should be putting it into practice			2
" a month later , @entity15 announced she was to become @entity11 's first female presidential candidate for elections expected to be held early next year			1
@entity15 , 49 , is not new to the spotlight in @entity11			1
she is a television presenter and political campaigner who once resigned from her job as a newsreader on state television because she did not believe the news she was reading			1
she is an outsider to heavyweight candidates such as @entity27 , the former head of the @entity29 , and @entity30 , former secretary general of the @entity32 , but @entity15 believes her campaign is gaining momentum			1
although no date has yet been set for the election , @entity15 , is already touring the country in an attempt to reach the people she says have been forgotten by the political elite of @entity6			1
she admits she does not have a budget like the mainstream candidates , or the entourage of bodyguards , but claims to have an army of passionate supporters meeting her wherever she goes			2
" from the day i announced my candidacy we have achieved a lot , " she said			0
" we have moved through the villages and brought the revolution to all of @entity11 , not just the big cities			1
" describing herself as a social democrat , @entity15 has made it her mission to listen to grievances of minorities			1
she said : " i promise by the election i will be the most informed of the candidates about the @entity64 people			0
i know the demands of the @entity72 , the people of @entity11 , the @entity66 , the workers and different groups from all parts of the country			1
" @entity15 believes the hard graft is paying off and winning her acceptance as a woman candidate			1
she said : " at first people were shocked , and after that they took me lightly , but now they are taking me more seriously			0
" they told me the @entity64 people ca n't accept a woman president but now they accept me			0
" the stereotype of @entity64 is that they wo n't vote for a woman , but people will vote for someone who can help them			0
if i 'm ready to help people , they will vote for me			0
" @entity15 's career in radio and television began soon after she graduated from @entity89 , where she was active in student politics			1
for six years , she hosted a late - night radio show called " @entity92 " before it was abruptly suspended in 1998			0
she went on to host a television show called " @entity94 " -- or " @entity95 " -- for the @entity97 - owned @entity96 for 10 years , before that too was taken off air earlier this year			2
in 2005 , @entity15 and two other women founded a movement called " @entity101 , " or " we are watching you " to observe @entity11 's first multi-party elections , and made a documentary about their efforts			1
she is now putting together a documentary of the same name about her experiences on the campaign trail , and is accompanied by a cameraman wherever she goes			0
the slogan for @entity15 's campaign -- @entity11 is my agenda -- stems from her experience during the 18 days of @entity11 's revolution in january and february this year			1
" when we were in @entity5 , the official media said we were part of a foreign agenda , so i chose the slogan ' @entity11 is my agenda			1
' " that revolution is still a work in progress , according to @entity15 , who is vocal in her criticism of interim government , the @entity127			1
she said : " i know that we have just started a revolution , we have n't made a revolution yet			0
there 's a lot more to do			2
" it 's still possible that we will see the blood coming , like in @entity135 and @entity136 because the army council wants to stay and try to kill the revolution , and one of the dirty schemes is to put the @entity64 people in a helpless state economically			2
" now the @entity64 ca n't feel good from the revolution			0
" such strong words do n't make her popular with everyone , but her calls for a complete change in politics resonate with many			0
@entity148 , professor of politics at the @entity149 , said she is well - known among young people , a familiar face in @entity5 during the revolution and famously outspoken , particularly in her criticism of the military council			0
he said : " on one occasion she was being interviewed on national tv after the revolution and when she criticized the military council the interviewer announced that he got orders to terminate the interview from his superiors			0
" young people -- much credited with bringing about @entity11 's revolution -- are central to @entity15 's philosophy			1
" what we need is not only a political revolution but also a social revolution , " she said			0
" politics under the @entity3 regime was thugs and black deals , so i want to work to build new values for @entity11			2
" she added : " i believe in tolerance and dialogue between the generations			0
i tell the elders we must respect our sons and daughters and take them seriously			0
" @entity15 , a divorcee with one daughter , has just remarried			2
her wedding to the activist judge @entity186 , a campaigner for judicial independence , slotted in between campaigning , trips abroad to speak at conferences on women 's issues and studying law part - time at university			2
the wedding was the day after @entity15 's telephone interview with @entity0			1
a few days later she flew to @entity197 for a summit of @entity200 women			0
" i 'm always busy , " she said			0
" it 's important to keep learning			2
