-- recent developments off the coast of @entity3 raise many questions , and we do not as yet have answers			1
last week , @entity3 media reported that the country 's military was searching for an underwater vessel , possibly a @entity12 submarine , after an emergency radio transmission allegedly made in @entity12 ( although @entity12 has denied it has any vessels in @entity3 waters )			1
now , as the @entity17 continues to search for the unidentified undersea vessel that may have penetrated the country 's territorial waters , it 's worth keeping in mind some key facts to help place the issue in perspective			1
for a start , anti-submarine warfare is complex and very difficult to execute properly			0
especially in the close confines of territorial waters , the advantages tend to accrue to the submarine			0
the rocky floor of an inland sea like the @entity33 can mask acoustic signatures that give watching ships , helicopters and maritime patrol aircraft the ability to track and identify a subsurface contact			2
second , this is happening against the backdrop of the @entity17 and @entity42 having suffered significant budget cuts over the past decades			1
as a general proposition , the @entity3 have a capable and professional force			2
but since the end of the @entity48 , they have not invested heavily in anti-submarine warfare capability			0
they are not alone in this regard -- many of the other @entity54 nations have likewise cut back in this area given a sense that anti-submarine warfare was something they would have needed against the @entity59 during the @entity48 but less so during @entity61 crisis days with @entity12			2
and although @entity3 is not a @entity64 member , meaning this operation is a national effort , it is a very strong partner to @entity64 and has been involved deeply in positive ways in @entity68 , the @entity69 , @entity70 and other operations			1
yet the fact remains that there is no treaty obligation on the part of @entity64 to be involved			0
if the @entity3 ask for help , it is likely that @entity64 would respond , but to date they have not done so			2
ultimately , though , we may never know exactly what has happened			0
it is entirely possible that a @entity12 submarine was performing an intelligence - gathering operation , and that it had a period of distress that alerted @entity3 authorities to its presence			1
it may have sorted out its challenges and slipped away			0
or it may be still operating in close while @entity12 sorts out a plan of action			0
the most recent volley from @entity12 , that it might be a @entity93 submarine , seems highly unlikely			0
if it was any other nation 's boat , they would have likely worked with the @entity3 immediately if their vessel was in distress			2
the @entity3 , who are capable and professional , seem insistent on their concern about an unknown undersea vessel			1
and the reality is that they have no reason to make any of this up , instead forthrightly reporting what they are seeing			0
with this in mind , @entity64 should offer to assist with other assets and help sort out the situation , especially if there is any possibility of a vessel in distress -- no matter what the circumstances of its presence in the @entity33 .			1

@entity121 : @entity3 media reported undersea vessel , possibly @entity12 , off coast
@entity12 denies this , he says . @entity17 searching , but rocky coast floor can hide signals
he says @entity3 not @entity64 member , but may seek help . @entity17 , @entity42 had budget cuts
@entity121 : @entity64 should offer to assist , especially if it turns out a vessel is in distress
