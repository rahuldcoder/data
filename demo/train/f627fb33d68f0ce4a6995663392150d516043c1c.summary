-- @entity1 grabbed the attention of national @entity3 in 2010 when he withstood a national @entity5 wave to win the governorship in @entity7 , an emerging battleground state			1
he caught some lucky breaks on the way : @entity7 @entity5 failed to nominate a serious candidate in a three - way race , and @entity1 ran a quirky and widely praised television ad that depicted him showering with his clothes on , symbolically rinsing off the stink of negative campaigning			1
@entity16 has also attracted notice by breaking with some of his fellow @entity3 in an effort to create a more business - friendly climate in the @entity20 as a co-founder of @entity23 's @entity22 , @entity1 still talks proudly about his experience as a small - business owner			1
he 's also a huge fan of craft beer and indie rock bands such as @entity28 and the @entity29			1
@entity30 named @entity1 , who served two terms as @entity23 's mayor , one of the country 's best mayors in 2005			1
with one of the highest approval ratings of any governor , @entity1 might be @entity39 's best asset in @entity7 as the president tries to carry the state 's nine electoral votes for the second time			1
he sat down with @entity0 at the annual meeting of the @entity45 in @entity46 , @entity47 , last weekend			0
the following interview has been edited for brevity and clarity : @entity0 : the suburbanites around @entity23 are exactly the kind of independent - minded voters president @entity39 needs in his fold to win in november			1
do you see the campaign 's questions about @entity59 's record at @entity60 and offshore bank accounts resonating with those voters or do they fall flat ? gov. @entity1 : to a certain extent , the suburban soccer moms are somewhat accepting of the fact that business is rough and tumble , and that some jobs get cut when you are taking over a business that 's failing			1
some job cuts are necessary			0
but i think they have a different sensitivity if people are avoiding paying taxes in the @entity76 and making profits on business done in the @entity76 but finding ways to avoid taxation			1
i think as more facts come out , that 's something that of all the @entity60 - related stories might have some serious ramifications in terms of how normal people deal with it			1
what 's interesting , especially with the independent voters , is there is a level of patriotism			1
we pay our taxes , and we do n't want to pay any more taxes , we hate government waste			1
but everyone should pay their share			1
when i was in the restaurant business , i used to see people get into these debates			1
it 's @entity3 , it 's conservative @entity5 , it 's almost all independents			1
there is a tremendous repulsion for people that get out of paying their share			1
@entity0 : as a business guy , do you think some of the harder - edged questions about @entity59 's private sector record turn off some people in the business community ? @entity1 : it does			1
there are certain people that think that			0
i think what people are concerned about is you 're branding all business as bad , which is certainly not the case			1
no step forward this country has ever taken has been without the business community helping move us forward			2
whether you care about homelessness , whether you care about education reform or whatever , the resources for that come from economic vitality -- a whole lot of businesses being successful and creating wealth , and then that wealth being used to help homeless kids			0
@entity0 : do you view his experience at @entity60 as part of wealth creation at large , the kind that lifts up homeless kids , for instance , or is it a different thing entirely ? @entity1 : it 's a component of the business system			1
i think what really creates wealth in this country , the major part of our wealth creation , comes from entrepreneurs , people starting businesses			0
that 's my preference because i lived part of that life			2
if you really squint your eyes and look at job creation , entrepreneurs create businesses , create jobs			0
they are always creating something			0
generally it 's small businesses , but when they get acquired by a large business as part of that acquisition , there are overlapping marketing departments , overlapping accounting departments , so they shed jobs			1
so once that happens , once you get these companies consolidating , they are always looking at efficiency			0
and that is really not job creation			0
as you get larger companies together , they shed jobs and they become more efficient and more profitable , so the stock price goes up , but that 's not pushing the country forward at the same level that entrepreneurs are			2
they are the ones that are creating the jobs that have customers			0
that is one of the defining points			0
they are creating jobs that have customers rather than just trying to control costs			0
@entity0 : when your friends in the business community complain about the president or say that @entity59 will lower their taxes or costs , what do you say to convince them that @entity39 is going to help their bottom line ? @entity1 : we have many discussions			1
what i tell everyone is what we need to create in this country is rising tide			0
we have to get the whole country moving forward			0
that 's not just one thing or one component of our economy			2
that 's the whole economy , right ? so you ca n't keep cutting funding for higher education			1
that 's a big part of how these entrepreneurs get started -- research grants or great ideas that come out of some laboratory at @entity242			2
those entrepreneurs need to be able to take that and grow it			0
the whole ecosystem has got to go up			0
the president is committed to investment and the key parts of what a business ecosystem to succeed			2
it needs an education system , and it needs a health care system			0
i keep going to my friends in business and i say , ' alright so , whether you want to talk about @entity259 or @entity260 , let 's pick one			1
' " @entity0 : does @entity259 help the president in @entity7 ? @entity1 : i think it helps him everywhere , ultimately			1
when i sit down with business guys , i tell them , ' let 's say we do n't want to do @entity259			1
secretary @entity267 has said we will give waivers if you find a way to expand coverage , control costs and prove outcomes			0
we will give you all the waivers you want			0
' that 's an opportunity to pick our own system			2
but everybody wants to expand coverage			0
everybody recognizes that small businesses ca n't get coverage			2
we already passed our health care exchange , and we did it with @entity5 and @entity3			0
let 's not get caught up in these false arguments			2
you can sit there and look at the whole system of what @entity39 's proposing and the whole system of what @entity59 's proposing , and i think the president 's has a higher probability of rising the whole tide and moving the economy more rapidly			1
@entity0 : what do you think @entity39 could do better in the campaign ? what would help him win @entity7 ? @entity1 : you know what he loves			1
i think that 's a huge advantage			2
i do n't think he shows it enough			2
those little things -- you have never heard that story			0
when he talked to the firefighters ( who were recently battling the @entity7 wildfires ) , he talked to 80 firefighters , and within five minutes moved them emotionally and inspired them			1
that 's something that he does , and it 's just who he is			2
he has always been able to do that			0
he was n't scripted , and there was no teleprompter			2
it was just him connecting			0
i think he has to find more opportunities to demonstrate to the @entity76 people who he is			2
@entity0 : last question : how are the @entity326 @entity325 going to do this year ? @entity1 : i love ( former @entity325 quarterback @entity328			1
i thought he was a remarkable guy			0
i was a big @entity328 fan			0
i am a huge @entity328 fan			0
i think he 's going to be a great quarterback somewhere , just watch			2
i think @entity332 , he had all these teams to pick from , but he picked the @entity325 because they have been building like crazy			0
and he thinks they can go to the @entity335 in the next two years			0
when @entity332 , who knows a lot about football , when he says they can go to the @entity335 , that means we 're all going to be tuned in .			0

@entity1 says there is a repulsion for those who do n't pay their fair share
