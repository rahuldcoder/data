@entity0 -- @entity4 advisers are considering recommending alleged 9/11 mastermind @entity5 be tried in a military court instead of a civilian one in @entity8 , a senior administration official told @entity1 on friday			1
in november , attorney general @entity9 announced his intention to try @entity5 in a @entity8 civilian court			1
" i am confident in the ability of our courts to provide these defendants a fair trial , just as they have for over 200 years , " @entity9 said last month			0
" the alleged 9/11 conspirators will stand trial in our justice system before an impartial jury under long - established rules and procedures			0
" a firestorm of opposition erupted from both @entity8 officials and top republicans after @entity9 's announcement			1
@entity8 police have estimated the cost to the city would exceed $ 200 million per year in a trial that could last years			2
they have said , among other things , that they would need to install more than 2,000 checkpoints in @entity36			0
also , some congressional leaders have argued @entity5 should not be entitled to all the protections and privileges a defendant receives in civilian court			2
last month , several lawmakers tied funding to close the detention facility in @entity45 , @entity46 , to holding a military trial for @entity5 and other suspected terrorists			1
to try @entity5 and others " as common criminals , giving them the constitutional rights of @entity57 citizens in our courts , is justice according to ' @entity52 , ' " said sen. @entity49 , a @entity50 independent			1
sen. @entity60 , @entity62 - @entity61 , argued that " our military justice system is best able to protect the @entity57 people			2
" @entity9 said last month the @entity70 " will have to take into account " the views of other political leaders and residents			0
" at the end of the day , wherever this case is tried , in whatever forum , what we have to ensure is that it 's done as transparently as possible and with adherence to all the rules			0
" @entity4 press secretary @entity77 said friday the administration was evaluating its options " based on @entity8 logistical and security concerns			0
" @entity77 and senior presidential adviser @entity82 have said previously that president @entity83 believes the trial should take place in a criminal court instead of before a military tribunal			1
the senior administration official emphasized that no final recommendation has been given to the president and therefore no final decision regarding the 9/11 terror trial has been made			1
the official said administration advisers hope a decision will be made before the president leaves for an overseas trip on march 18			0
@entity97 activists blasted the potential administration switch			0
" if this stunning reversal comes to pass , president @entity83 will deal a death blow to his own @entity70 , not to mention @entity57 values , " said @entity99 , executive director of the @entity100			2
" if the president flip - flops and retreats to the @entity106 military commissions , he will betray his campaign promise to restore the rule of law , demonstrate that his principles are up for grabs and lose all credibility with @entity57 who care about justice and the rule of law			1

@entity83 administration *insisted* 9/11 trial in @entity8 would be *symbol* of @entity57 rule of law
@entity8 officials do not want @entity5 tried in @entity36
@entity123 want military , not civilian , trial
recommendation would mean @entity83 administration reverses itself on two fronts
