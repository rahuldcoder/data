-- the agent who penetrated @entity5 and returned from @entity6 with the group 's new " airline bomb " was always under @entity3 control and was not a double - agent , two sources briefed by @entity3 counterterrorism officials have told @entity0			1
one source told @entity0 that the device was recovered around april 20 , more than a week before the first anniversary of the killing of @entity15 , and was then handed over to the @entity16 for forensic analysis			1
one source said that from the very beginning , the infiltrator was working for @entity3 intelligence			1
the other said @entity3 intelligence was involved " from a to @entity25 " the source added that the agent involved had moved in the " jihadist orbit " in @entity3 before being recruited			1
the agent was sent to @entity6 " months and months " ago , when @entity3 sources in @entity6 reported indications that @entity5 , or @entity5 , might be again preparing a plot against @entity16 aviation , one source said			1
these were the first indications " that @entity5 might be trying again , " according to one source , after the @entity33 2009 underwear bomb plot and the laser - printer bombs dispatched from @entity6 in october 2010			1
the whole operation was personally overseen by @entity36 , the head of @entity3 counterterrorism , one source said			1
initial reports had not revealed the extent of @entity3 involvement			1
at one point , the @entity3 agent reported that a device was being built , and the @entity3 then informed the @entity16 , according to one of the latest sources , who spoke to @entity0 on condition of anonymity , citing the sensitivity of the information			1
the agent then received training on the device from @entity5 instructors			0
according to one source the device contained @entity55 explosive , the same explosive used in previous attacks by @entity5 's master bomb - maker @entity58			1
describing the bomb , one source said it was smaller than previous bombs made by @entity62			2
the other said it contained an amount of explosive similar to that hidden inside laser printers that were sent from @entity6 in october 2010			0
the printer devices contained 300 to 400 grams of explosive and had a larger amount of high explosive than carried in the @entity33 flight from @entity72 to @entity73			0
one source told @entity0 the device was designed to be worn in clothing			2
there has been no confirmation from other sources of that detail			0
the source said the device was " more advanced " than the underwear device , as @entity62 was trying to rectify past mistakes			2
the device in 2009 failed to detonate , apparently because the detonation charge failed to set off the @entity55 explosives			0
the source added that @entity5 bomb - makers apparently believed that in the case of the @entity33 plot they had got the initiator mechanism wrong , and that the mistake in that case was to mix acids slowly in an effort to begin the detonation			1
homeland security secretary @entity96 told reporters tuesday that the device is " similar to the underwear bomber of 2009 , but an evolution to that			0
" @entity3 intelligence had hoped that their agent would be able to get information about @entity62 's whereabouts , but the agent did not meet @entity62 , one source said			1
one source cautioned : " even if @entity62 is eventually killed , we should not celebrate , because he has trained many people			2
" it is still unclear how the device left @entity6			0
one @entity112 source familiar with the investigation said he assumed it had been carried on a plane , which would raise troubling questions about airport security in the capital , @entity119			2
but another hinted that it had been carried overland , in the possession of the @entity3 mole			1
one source said @entity3 counterterrorism officials were upset that details of the operation had emerged in the @entity16 because they had a network of agents inside @entity5 who could be compromised by leaks from @entity130			1
the sources also questioned suggestions that the infiltrator 's information led to the successful drone strike over the weekend that targeted @entity136 , a leading figure in @entity5			0
the @entity3 agent did not meet @entity139 while in @entity6 , according to one source			1
the sources said @entity5 has better resources than previously and is using the safe haven created in southern @entity6 to good effect			0
the group has developed laboratories and is extending training in chemistry and bomb - making , he said			1
" at the moment they can operate in relative freedom , " the source said			2
the @entity3 concern over the leak of information about the mole infiltrating @entity5 was echoed by the chairman of the @entity16 @entity159			1
" it 's really , to me , unfortunate that this has gotten out , because this could really interfere with operations overseas , " rep. @entity160 told @entity0 's @entity161 on tuesday			0
" my understanding is a major investigation is going to be launched because of this			0
" a senior administration official told @entity0 that officials were debating whether to release photographs of the device to law enforcement agencies			0
on one side of the argument , @entity176 screeners and law enforcement might more easily identify any similar devices made as part of the same plot , the official said			0
but officials were reluctant to do so out of concern that the photographs would be leaked to the news media and that the would - be bombers would learn what law enforcement knows -- and might not know -- about the bomb 's workings			2
@entity192 , the chief @entity193 counterterrorism adviser , who told @entity201 's " @entity200 " on tuesday that officials believe redundant security systems would have prevented any airline bombing attempt from succeeding , but analysts were studying the device to see whether security procedures should be adjusted			0
" we 're trying to make sure that we take the measures that we need to prevent any other type of @entity205 , similarly constructed , from getting through security procedures , " @entity192 said			0
a @entity208 spokesman said authorities have " no specific , credible information regarding an active terrorist plot against the @entity16 at this time			2
" but another @entity16 official told @entity0 , " we are not ready to say the threat stream is over			2
we believe external plotting continues			0
" @entity0 's @entity215 , national security contributor @entity216 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 and @entity221 and journalist @entity222 contributed to this report			0
