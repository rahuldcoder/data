-- @entity2 's president emeritus said that if the players on its football team are successful at forming a union , he could see the prestigious private institution giving up @entity9 football			1
@entity10 , speaking last week at the annual conference for the @entity12 , said , " if we got into collective bargaining situations , i would not take for granted that the @entity15 of the world would continue to play @entity9 sports			1
" @entity10 , who was president of @entity2 from 1995 to 2009 , made his comments during a panel discussion that included a presentation from @entity21 , the president of the @entity22 and the man who helped organize former @entity2 quarterback @entity24 to lead a unionization attempt before the @entity26			1
@entity27 talked , as he has for months , about the issues his organization sees as great flaws in the current @entity32 model			0
the @entity22 believes that athletes in the revenue - generating sports of college football and men 's basketball are taken advantage of by universities , conferences and the @entity32 , making billions from games , while the players sometimes struggle with basic needs like medical care , concussion testing and guaranteed scholarships			1
players make argument for union in march , the @entity22 took its fight before the @entity26 in @entity51 and presented a case during a five - day hearing			2
both sides just recently submitted court briefs and a ruling could come by the end of this month , but will likely be appealed by the losing side and could go as far as the @entity60 @entity59			0
in short , it could take years before there is a definitive decision			0
@entity10 did n't specifically speak about players being paid , but if the unionization is successful , that would be on the bargaining table , and critics of pay - for - play say they fear that would hurt the academic side of collegiate athletics			2
@entity10 alluded to that when he said a win for the players could lead private institutions with high academic standards -- he specifically cited @entity77 and @entity78 -- to abandon the current model in order to preserve academic integrity			1
he compared it to the pullback of the @entity85 schools decades ago , when the @entity85 conference decided to opt out of postseason play and to end athletic scholarships , preserving the emphasis on academics for the players			1
" in the 1950s , the @entity85 had some of the highest - ranked football teams in the country			1
the @entity95 teams were ranked in the top 5 or 10 at that time			2
they continue periodically to have ranked basketball teams , but they 've given up a certain kind of model of sports , " he said , adding that " under certain conditions " the same could happen at other private elite universities that " continue to play big time sports			1
" @entity105 , senior associate athletic director at @entity95 , said that change for the @entity85 allowed those schools to maintain academic integrity in the sports where , at other schools , academics can often be compromised in the name of the game			1
" it was sort of a breaking point moment , " @entity105 said , saying the @entity85 schools made the decision not to move forward like the bigger conferences -- to " draw the line with the commercialization of what football was becoming			1
" " and the results have been that @entity124 football is not what it was in the first half of the 20th century , " @entity105 said			0
" certainly not like @entity128 football , @entity129 football			0
its crowds are generally less than 10,000 people			0
they play only 10 games a year			0
... certainly not what is going on at @entity135 level			0
" a @entity77 spokesman said the university did not have a comment on @entity10 's remarks , and a @entity78 spokeswoman told @entity0 that @entity78 is monitoring the unionization attempt and , like @entity2 , considers its athletes to be " students , first and foremost			1
" while supportive of the freedom of the athletes to file this petition to unionize , @entity2 officials are fighting the petition , which hinges on whether athletes should be considered employees of the university			1
during his daylong testimony , @entity152 quarterback @entity24 talked about time requirements that are year - round , at times 50 hours a week devoted to football			1
" we are first and foremost an athlete , " @entity24 testified			0
" everything we do is scheduled around football			0
... it 's truly a job			0
" @entity24 said he had to give up his pre-med - related major because he could n't fit the classes into his schedule			0
the university countered that by bringing in students who were able to stay in rigorous classes , but @entity24 's sentiment was echoed by the @entity32 itself in a 2012 survey that asked athletes what they would change about their college experience			1
about 15 % of men 's football , baseball and basketball players said they would have had different majors had they not been athletes			1
twelve percent of @entity9 football players said athletics prevented them from majoring in what they wanted			1
the average time spent on athletics in - season hovered around 40 hours per week for all three sports , according to the survey			1
that flies in the face of the @entity32 20 - hour rule , which states that , no matter the sport , coaches ca n't take up more than 20 hours of their players time			2
right before @entity10 spoke at the @entity12 , big 12 commissioner @entity194 called the 20 - hour rule " a joke " and said paperwork is constantly falsified			2
" i do n't know in a particular case what was said to mr. @entity24 , " @entity10 said a few minutes later at the @entity12 , referring to @entity24 's statement that he could n't take certain classes			0
" i do know that there were many students at @entity2 and at @entity204 and at @entity78 and at @entity77 who took , and for that matter at @entity207 and at @entity208 who took very exacting courses , have had very distinguished academic careers and balanced being athletes and big - time sports with very exacting academic programs			1
" if they win at the labor relations board , the athletes at @entity2 would get a seat at the bargaining table and could negotiate for a cut of the billion - dollar revenues			1
but the most compelling argument they 've made is for continuing medical coverage for injuries that continue after they leave school			2
without it , athletes like former @entity2 player @entity227 are stuck with the potential for lifelong and crippling pain			1
@entity227 was called one of the fastest teens in @entity233 when he was recruited to @entity2 in 2003 , but after fracturing both legs on the field , he was left with painful metal rods that are too expensive for him to have removed without help			2
he 's in so much pain , he can barely run , he said			0
he 's only 27 years old			0
" i 'm like a 45 - year - old man			0
i ca n't move , " he said			0
@entity24 walked into the labor hearing with a boot on his foot , just a few weeks out of ankle surgery -- an injury from last season			0
he testified that @entity2 is disputing how much it should pay for his out - of - pocket expenses			2
@entity27 argues that all former athletes should be guaranteed full coverage of injuries from their time playing for their schools			2
it 's the one area where @entity10 seemed to agree			0
" i 'm willing to say that there may be extraordinary expenses through injuries on the playing field			0
i do n't know what other universities do , how long paying or helping pay for those injuries are , but i think that 's an important point and i think there are obligations that universities have here and i would like to have better information			0
" athletes file class - action against @entity32			2
