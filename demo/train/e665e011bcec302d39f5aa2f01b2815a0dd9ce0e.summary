-- @entity2 authorities will announce a new search area wednesday in the hunt for missing @entity5 , according to the agency overseeing the effort			1
the @entity8 said sunday it 's been re-examining data that could shift the search area hundreds of kilometers south along an arc derived from satellite data			1
more than three months after flight 370 disappeared over @entity15 , searchers have found no trace of the @entity17 or the 239 people aboard , making it one of the biggest mysteries in aviation history			0
police : report about pilot is wrong meanwhile , @entity25 police are denying a report in a @entity28 newspaper that @entity5 pilot @entity29 is the primary suspect in the probe into the plane 's disappearance			1
the investigation is " ongoing " on all angles , with nothing conclusive at this time , @entity25 police spokeswoman @entity33 told @entity0			1
" we did not make any statement to say that capt. @entity29 was the prime suspect , " she said , refuting an article in @entity28 's @entity38 that says @entity29 is now the sole focus of the investigation			1
the article cites unnamed industry and @entity45 government sources familiar with the state of the investigation as claiming that @entity29 is " the prime suspect if the plane 's disappearance turns out to be the result of human intervention			1
" that conclusion is based on claims that police found @entity29 to be the only member of the flight crew who had made no personal or professional obligations for the future , the report claimed			2
the story also said evidence from the flight simulator at @entity29 's home showed he had plotted -- but then deleted -- paths to the deep southern @entity63 and landings on short runways			0
but the report notes that investigators have not ruled out the possibility of a mechanical malfunction or terrorism , and acknowledges that the case against @entity29 is based on circumstantial evidence			0
an @entity74 review of the two pilots ' hard drives , including one in the flight simulator @entity29 had built at his home , had not turned up a " smoking gun , " a @entity80 official with knowledge of the investigation told @entity0 in march			0
what 's next authorities have not been able to explain why the jet veered dramatically off course during a scheduled flight from @entity87 , @entity25 , to @entity88 on march 8			2
hopes of closure for the families of those on board were raised in early april , when a search team in the southern @entity63 detected pings that were initially believed to have come from the plane 's flight data recorders			2
but @entity2 authorities said an exhaustive search of the sea floor around the pings yielded no wreckage and ruled the area out as the aircraft 's final resting place			2
now , officials are preparing for the next stage of the search			0
@entity2 , the closest country to where the plane is believed to have entered the ocean , has said it will delegate the management and operation of the new phase to a private company			0
the @entity8 , which is leading the search at the request of the @entity25 government , said it is accepting proposals for the task until the end of june			1
the new search is expected to start in august at the earliest			0
outside group tells governments where to search for @entity5 a hole in the clouds , an empty space on earth @entity0 's @entity130 contributed to this report .			0
