@entity0 -- mobile payments company @entity2 is supersizing its hardware			1
on tuesday , ceo @entity5 unveiled the @entity7 stand , which the company hopes will replace traditional cash registers			1
the @entity11 is a white countertop unit that looks like a small @entity13			1
it holds an @entity14 or 3 and features a card reader that juts out on the bottom			1
it 's the company 's first piece of hardware since the original @entity2 reader			2
the $ 299 unit includes a usb hub that can connect to third - party tools that traditional retailers still rely on , such as a cash drawer , receipt printer and barcode scanner			1
@entity2 believes the future of payments is n't swiping a card but merely giving a cashier your name , which is stored within the company 's database and linked to a credit card			1
but there are a lot of companies that still take cash , and customers who want paper receipts			0
smaller mobile merchants such as food trucks , coffee shops and taxis have all flocked to the small @entity2 reader , which plugs into an @entity50 or @entity7 's headphone port			1
but @entity2 wanted to create a product that could work for higher volume brick and mortar merchants , including those that still accept old - fashioned cash			2
square also thinks that having a more solid physical register is a good move for smaller merchants			0
" it adds this sense of security , validation that you 're a business , " @entity5 said at an event here			0
the @entity11 can be affixed to a table or drilled in through a hole in the counter for added security			0
it tilts and swivels around so customers can do their part , like adding a tip or signing their name			0
it connects to the @entity7 's dock connector instead of the audio jack , and the company said the credit card reader works every time a card is swiped			1
@entity5 would n't say if the readers were coming to @entity2 partner @entity83 anytime soon , though he did say that the two companies were working together			0
according to @entity5 , @entity2 did n't want to disrupt @entity83 ' counter setup until it knew it had a product that could beat the speed of the current system			2
" what matters most is getting people through the line , " @entity5 said			0
the @entity11 seems built for speed			2
the stands will be seen in 13 businesses in 30 locations around the @entity96 , starting wednesday .			0
