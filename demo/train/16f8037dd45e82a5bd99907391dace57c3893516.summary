-- in april , a dejected @entity1 slumped away from the well - manicured @entity3 golf course after suffering one of the most dramatic final - round collapses in the sport 's history			1
despite starting the day as the dominant force and with a four - shot lead at the prestigious masters , nerves and neuroses combined in the @entity14 sunshine to see him drop six strokes in three holes on the back nine on his way to an eight - over - par 80			2
his first career major had slipped through his fingers and his meltdown -- excruciating miss after excruciating miss -- had been captured by the world 's media			2
the disintegration of @entity1 's focus and golfing faculty was such that doubt was cast on his burgeoning talent			2
did the young @entity31 have what it took to be a champion ? the question did not remain unanswered for long			2
fast forward two months , having not long passed his 22nd birthday , when @entity1 showed the steel that many feared he lacked by destroying all before him at the @entity40 with a tournament - record 16 - under - par total at @entity43			1
his first major had been won , redemption had been achieved			0
after a turnaround worthy of @entity47 -- which is maybe fitting for a man born in the small town of @entity50 -- @entity1 became a superstar			0
and the scintillating form of 2011 that had driven his meteoric rise continued : he is currently second in the world rankings and on the verge of finishing top of the @entity58 's money list for the first time			1
@entity60 holds no terror for golf 's new world order maybe unsurprisingly , he is looking forward to 2012			1
" i 'm in a very happy place in my life , " @entity1 told @entity0			0
" i 'm very happy with what 's going on on the golf course			0
" there have been a few changes in my life			0
one of the biggest ones is becoming a major champion and realizing the different pressures that come with that status			1
" it 's nice to have one major , but then to get your second and to call yourself a multiple major champion would be something very special and it 's something i want to try to do next year			1
" in 1997 , another 22 - year - old had similarly lofty ambitions			1
after a year which saw him clinch the @entity85 title , @entity60 used his first major triumph as a springboard for one of the most devastating spells of dominance that golf , and indeed sport , has ever seen			1
another 13 majors followed for @entity60 during a decade of almost uninterrupted supremacy , before injury and revelations about his personal life in late 2009 led to a meltdown both on and off the golf course			0
@entity101 ' collapse was dramatic			0
first , he surrendered top spot in the world rankings for the first time in 281 weeks when @entity106 usurped him in november 2010			2
it marked the start of @entity60 ' troubles and his nadir arrived in october this year , when a two - year winless streak culminated with him slipping out of the top 50 for the first time since 1996			1
but recently @entity60 has shown signs of flickering back into life , exhibiting flashes of his dominant best to clinch last week 's @entity117 and finally stop the rot			2
far from intimidating @entity1 , the possibility of facing a rejuvenated @entity60 inspires him			1
@entity1 hopes to test himself to the limit by putting himself through a final - day showdown with the 35 - year - old in 2012			1
" i 'm looking forward to hopefully having the chance to go up against him next year on the final day of a tournament , " @entity1 said of @entity60			1
" i 'm sure a lot of the younger guys are as well because it 's something we 've never been able to do before			0
" it 's new to us and it 's a big challenge , to see how we handle it and to pit ourselves against possibly the best player to ever play the game			0
" the younger guys @entity1 speaks of have capitalized on the power vacuum created by @entity60 ' fall from grace			1
although hardly a youngster , @entity138 's @entity137 has benefited the most by rising to the top of the world rankings and sealing his position at the top of the @entity144 @entity143 money list			2
in fact , if the 34 - year - old can fend off competition from @entity1 at this weekend 's @entity147 he will become the first player in the sport 's history to finish a season top of both the @entity154 and @entity144 money lists			1
in addition to @entity137 , an array of rising stars have blazed a trail up the world rankings			0
one such player is @entity162 's @entity161 , who finished second at the @entity85 and @entity40 during a breakthrough 2011			1
" there 's quite a few of us out there , the likes of myself , @entity169 , @entity161 , " explained @entity1			2
" @entity161 is a guy who really impresses me			0
" i 've played quite a lot of golf with him this year			0
he 's only 23 years old and he 's been second in two majors this year and he 's really cemented himself among the top players in the world			1
i think he 'll have a very good season next year			0
" as one of the sport 's bright young hopes , @entity1 's profile is bound to rise in 2012			1
but it is not just his on - course performance which is attracting media attention			0
@entity1 's blossoming romance with the world 's top - ranked female tennis player @entity184 is another reason why his celebrity stock is on the rise			1
" i 'm very content , " @entity1 said			0
" i 'm happy with the team that i have around me and i 'm happy with everything else that 's going on			0
we both lead very similar lifestyles			0
if i 'm perfectly honest , @entity184 is a very good influence on me			0
" @entity1 explained how the drive exhibited by his @entity196 girlfriend in pursuit of her maiden grand slam title acts as an inspiration to him			2
" she is incredibly hard - working , she puts 100 % effort into her game			0
it 's nice to be able to share things with someone who really understands , " he said of the 21 - year - old			1
" i 've really enjoyed the time that i 've spent with her over the past few months			0
" @entity1 has certainly come a long way since that disastrous sunday at the masters , with his new - found confidence best illustrated by his response to the question , " would you back yourself to win a major next season ? " his three - word answer : " yes i would			2
