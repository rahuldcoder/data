@entity0 , @entity1 -- there was no way he should have been on that medal stand			0
going into the final turn of saturday night 's 1,500 - meter short - track speed skating final , @entity7 was fifth			1
the @entity11 skaters had a firm grasp on the gold , silver and bronze			1
and then inexplicably , two of the @entity11 crashed , and the 19 - year - old @entity7 followed teammate @entity17 across the finish line to stunningly finish second and third			1
kind of a miracle , but @entity7 has overcome much bigger odds			1
five months ago , it would have impossible for someone to think @entity7 could win a medal , or even be here			1
he lay on the ice after a full - speed crash at the @entity29 , bleeding profusely , his left thigh sliced open by a skate blade			1
the cut was six inches wide and two inches deep			0
it would require 60 stitches			0
but first he had to remove the blade , which was still stuck in his leg			2
there was so much blood , he wondered if he was going to skate again			2
he did n't know it at the time , but the gash was just an inch from the main artery in his leg			2
fortunately , the blade only cut muscle			2
" when i was laying on that ice , i was in defeat at first , " he said sunday			0
" i thought my whole career was over			0
but i guess in those moments is where we truly define ourselves			0
" at the hospital , @entity7 asked someone to take a photo of the gash			1
it is a nasty picture , and while @entity7 is keen to show it to anyone who will have a look , it is the only time he reflects on the injury			1
" after it happened , i knew i needed to get back on my feet , and the way to do that was to not think about it , " he said			0
@entity7 jumped right into rehabilitation under the care of dr. @entity68 , the speed skating legend who is now an orthopedic surgeon , and then dr. @entity71 , the director for sports medicine clinics for the @entity73			1
" there are never any guarantees with an injury like this , but i will say this : whatever happens to @entity7 , it will not be because of a lack of effort			2
he is working so , so hard , " @entity71 told freelance writer @entity82 in early november			0
by october , @entity7 was able to throw away his crutches			2
though he still could n't skate , he stayed motivated by going down to a rink near his place at the training center in @entity86 and watching the skaters from a local club			0
he finally got back on the ice on november 16 , just eight weeks before the @entity90			1
it was difficult for him , and he was tentative and he skated very slowly , he said			0
" i did have flashbacks at first , " he said			0
he even fell a few times during training , which was a good thing because it helped his mental recovery			0
he found a toughness inside , he said , and his family helped immensely			0
it was as important as his physical rehabilitation			0
before his injury , @entity7 was the heir apparent to now six - time medallist @entity17			1
before his first @entity90 race , his first since the crash , he was just a question mark			1
now , with two races , the 1,000 meters on saturday and the 5,000 - meter relay on february 26 remaining , he 's a remarkable comeback story with an unending smile and a most unusual picture on his @entity110 .			1
