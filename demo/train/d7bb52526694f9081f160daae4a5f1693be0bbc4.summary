-- @entity2 champion @entity1 slumped to a tame defeat in the fading gloom of a rain - hit opening monday at @entity6 to @entity8 outsider @entity7			1
third seed @entity1 , who won the @entity10 at the start of the clay court season , showed little of that form as he surrendered 4 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 2 6 - 0 on @entity14 to the world number 41			1
the @entity17 number one looked to restoring equilibrium when he took a hard - fought second set , but was outplayed in the remaining two to suffer an embarrassing first round exit in the second grand slam of the season			2
he saved one match point a 0 - 5 down in the fourth but then completed a match of 61 unforced errors by hitting a backhand long			0
@entity7 raised his arms in triumph while @entity1 trudged off after the final action on the show courts after a weather - hit second day			1
" it was n't good at all , i kept trying to find my game , anything to get back in it but i just need to take a few days off now and figure out what happened , " @entity1 told gathered reporters after his defeat			1
" he 's a really good player but it was me , i could n't find solutions and it was just terrible and a really big disappointment			1
" earlier the two favorites for the men 's title , eight - time champion @entity47 and world number two @entity49 eased their way through between the rain showers			1
@entity47 dropped only three games in a ruthless demolition of @entity55 @entity54 , while @entity49 could afford to delight the @entity14 crowd with an impromptu chat with a ball boy			1
the 27 - year - old @entity59 was sitting under an umbrella during a break in play when he gestured to the young man to join him			0
they sat for several minutes talking and @entity65 even offered his new friend a drink before clinking bottles with him			0
the crowd lapped it up and burst into applause and after his 6 - 1 6 - 2 6 - 4 demolition of @entity74 's @entity73 , @entity49 revealed the subject of the conversation			1
" we had a nice chat , " he told the official @entity78 website			0
" he 's a tennis player , so i asked him how long he 's playing , and , you know , how he 's enjoying his time as a ball kid			2
" it was a nice , fun time , something unusual for the grand slams			0
he accepted the offer to sit down , which i did n't think he would do , but he did			0
so he 's very spontaneous little boy , and i hope i see him my next match			2
" that will be against @entity93 @entity92 , with second seed @entity49 predicting a tougher test			1
defending champion @entity47 was even less troubled by @entity54 , who has not won a match on the @entity97 all season and but for a spell in the second set did not muster much resistance			1
it was the top seed 's 60th win at the @entity78 and he later shrugged off suggestions he had been snubbed by not playing on the main showpiece court of @entity14 and instead placed on @entity106			1
a fellow professional had called the decision " bizarre " but @entity47 claimed not to be bothered by the scheduling			2
" it does n't really matter a lot , " he said			0
" @entity6 is a pleasure for me , is a really honor , and is a special feeling			0
so all the memories at this place give me are unforgettable			0
" and does n't matter if it 's @entity118 or @entity106 or another court , " added the @entity116			2
@entity47 has suffered shock defeats in the clay court season and came close to losing in the final of the @entity123 to @entity124 until the @entity126 player succumbed to a back problem			2
great things were still expected of @entity124 at the clay court grand slam , but the ninth seed did not appear to have shrugged off his injury as he went out 7 - 6 6 - 1 6 - 2 to @entity134 @entity133 in his opening match			0
" it 's tough for me , but i guess this is my tennis life , you know			0
i have to take care of my body and injury will come again , for sure			0
so i have to mentally be ready , " he said			0
" i have to do whatever i can do to get healthy			0
" in the women 's draw there was an easy first round win for seventh @entity147 as she beat fellow @entity149 @entity148 6 - 1 6 - 2			1
@entity147 , who lost last year 's final to @entity150 , needed only 27 minutes to wrap up the opening set and carried on her domination into the second			1
she will now face @entity156 's 2010 @entity155 semi-finalist @entity154 for a place in the third round but @entity150 looms as a possible quarterfinal opponent for the 2012 champion			2
watch : @entity147 's love affair with @entity162			1

@entity1 big name *casualty* on second day
@entity1 beaten by @entity7 in four sets
@entity47 and @entity49 win first round matches
@entity147 eases through in women 's draw
