-- despite not kicking a ball , @entity1 were the biggest winners on wednesday night as @entity3 drew 2 - 2 with @entity4 in a game that football fans almost forgot			1
this was the game in hand that both @entity3 and @entity4 had long seen as decisive in their bid to finish in the @entity13 's top four and so secure @entity12 qualification -- but the long - awaited fixture was all but ignored for large parts of wednesday			1
the news earlier in the day that sir @entity17 was to step down as @entity19 manager after nearly 27 years in the job dominated the minds of football followers who would otherwise have been focusing on a decisive clash in @entity24			0
as if to underline the point , both @entity3 boss @entity25 and @entity4 manager @entity26 found their usual pre-match interviews sidetracked by their thoughts on the @entity31 , who has amassed 38 trophies during his time with @entity19			1
despite their differences over the years , @entity17 's long - standing rival @entity25 -- who used to manage @entity19 's traditional rivals @entity35 -- was magnanimous in his praise for the 71 - year - old			2
" i have always liked to compete against him as a manager , " the @entity45 , who may go down in history as the last coach to beat @entity17 following @entity3 's 1 - 0 win at @entity50 on sunday , told @entity42 television			1
" as a person , i wish him health in his retirement and i hope he enjoys his football in a different way			0
" meanwhile , the @entity56 , who was returning to his former club , said the @entity13 had lost one of its " most charismatic managers " and " the reference point in terms of coaches and being a successful manager "			2
shortly after , it was back to work for the pair as both sides continued to work on the final chapters of a thrilling race to see who will secure a coveted @entity12 berth for next season			0
hosts @entity3 knew that victory would all but guarantee them a place in the competition , which they won last year , while fifth - placed @entity4 needed the three points to climb above great rivals @entity1 to ensure that their @entity12 destiny is in their own hands			1
nonetheless , the draw played out best for the @entity82 -- their 67 points one better than @entity4 ' tally -- with @entity1 knowing that victories in their remaining fixtures against @entity87 ( home ) and @entity89 ( away ) will guarantee them a top - four finish			1
@entity3 , who travel to @entity92 on saturday before finishing at home against @entity94 , started the @entity95 clash the brighter , taking an early lead when the @entity98 @entity97 converted @entity100 's flick - on from a tenth - minute corner			1
the @entity102 continued to pour forward but were undone after 26 minutes when @entity103 , who has found goals hard to come by , ran 50 yards unchallenged before curling home from outside the area for his third @entity13 strike of the season			2
@entity109 restored @entity3 's lead shortly before half - time as he finished off a sweeping move and the same player had the chance to kill off @entity4 ' @entity12 hopes in the second half only to slip at the crucial moment after being teed up by @entity117			1
with just 10 minutes left , substitute @entity118 leveled for the visitors after a cute @entity103 backheel but despite a late free - kick from @entity122 , @entity4 had to settle for a draw that may ultimately seem disappointing			1
" it was good to get the point , " @entity26 said later			0
" we have to do our job and hope that somebody else slips up			0
the @entity13 is absolutely unpredictable and hopefully it can fall our way			2
" his side play at @entity132 on sunday before hosting @entity133 on 19 may , the final day of the @entity13 season , and are likely to need two victories to sneak into the @entity12 places			2
such matters are of course trivial for @entity17 , who steered @entity19 to the @entity13 title -- the 13th of his reign -- in his final season in charge , so securing yet another crack at @entity145 's best clubs for the three - time continental champions			1
in @entity149 's @entity148 , @entity147 ensured that leaders @entity151 must wait a little while longer before sealing the championship			1
@entity155 's side thrashed nine - man @entity156 6 - 2 at the @entity158 to reach 80 points for the season , eight behind @entity151 with only three games now left for @entity147			1
@entity151 have a game in hand over their closest rivals ( and defending champions ) , who shared their goals between six players -- with @entity168 , who missed a penalty , inevitably among those on the scoresheet			0
arguably the biggest news of the night came with the publication of the team line - ups , with defender @entity175 - who has fallen out with @entity155 - absent from the squad			0
" @entity175 's absence is the decision of the manager , " @entity177 , who replaced the @entity178 and opened the scoring , told @entity180			0
" what we have to do is work and be united			0
we have three weeks left until the end of the season and we need to work until the end			0
" earlier in the evening , @entity190 guaranteed their place in next season 's @entity12 with a 3 - 1 win over @entity194 - a result that means they will finish the season in the top three			2
the same reward for a hard season was achieved by @entity201 in @entity202 , who secured the @entity205 runner - up when beating @entity206 3 - 0			0
@entity207 stretched his lead atop the scoring charts to 27 goals as @entity201 ensured they can no longer be caught by @entity212 , who sunk @entity214 4 - 0 to stay in the @entity12 hunt			0
@entity217 's side face a nervous last two games of the season , at home to @entity221 and away to @entity222 , as they try to beat @entity223 to third place in @entity202 , which guarantees a qualifying place in @entity145 's premier club competition .			0

@entity3 draw 2 - 2 at home to @entity4 in @entity13
blues stay third with *69* points , two more than @entity1 with fifth - placed @entity4 on *66*
