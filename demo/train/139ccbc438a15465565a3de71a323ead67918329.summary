" @entity1 ' retirement means there are still no openly gay players participating in professional football in @entity80 with the exception of @entity83 - based @entity82			1
' @entity84 reveals he is gay it was hoped that @entity82 's coming out , which attracted headlines the world over in march 2011 , would pave the way for other gay footballers to take similar steps			1
but not since the tragic loss of @entity93 has a top - flight league witnessed an openly gay professional football player			1
@entity93 , who committed suicide in 1998 , became the first Â£ 1 million black player in the history of @entity100 football when he signed for @entity101 in 1981			1
while at @entity101 , constant rumors and speculation surrounded his private life with concocted allegations of affairs with conservative mps			0
@entity108 after admitting he is gay with the rumors continuing throughout his career , he finally came out in 1990 and continued to play for a whole host of lower league clubs			1

only this week , police launched an investigation into allegations that a @entity145 footballer made homophobic gestures towards @entity148 fans during an @entity100 second division match			1
view : hi - res gallery of openly gay athletes @entity148 , which is situated on the south coast , has a large gay population and its fans are often targeted with homophobic chants			1
" i think there 's a big culture shift needed within football from the grassroots to the top of the game , " @entity156 of @entity157 told @entity0 " the top of the game is a symptom of a much wider issue about lack of awareness and ignorance around the ability of gay men to participate and excel at football " when you 've got a lack of gay players at the top level , then it 's easy for that environment to be quite negative			1
" i imagine there are players who are reticent to come out			0
" opinion : why the fuss about gay marriage ? while other sports have embraced their gay stars , such as @entity186 in basketball , @entity188 in tennis and @entity190 in rugby , football has yet to move with the times			2
off the field , the @entity194 @entity193 backed a bill to legalize gay marriage earlier this month as society continues to move forward			2
and while football has yet to move with the times , progress is being made			0

" within football , people do n't understand the seriousness of homophobia , " added @entity156			0
" the things fans shout at players , they believe it 's not hurting them and they do n't care if they 're gay or not			2
" homophobia is used to put players down and it 's a way of deriding players			0
that 's cultural all the way through football and happens in other sports			0
" when a player gives a pass away or falls over , fans use homophobia abuse to put them down and it 's that which we want to stop			2
" one of our key things is changing chanting in the stadium			0
stop and think before you chant			0
" @entity235 youngster @entity234 fined for calling teammate ' gay ' a particular success story in @entity100 has been the creation of the @entity239 , where " gay friendly " teams compete on a regular basis			1
@entity1 ' story has been met with admiration from fellow gay football players , but his retirement from the game means that the community is still waiting for a player to come out and continue playing			1
" the great pity with @entity1 is that he felt it was an ' either or choice , ' " @entity251 , who plays for @entity252 in the @entity239 told @entity0			1
" reading his blog , it felt as if he thought he had no choice but to quit football if he wanted come out			2
" he could have easily retired without coming out but he 's been very brave and hopefully set us in the right direction			2
" he has n't forced us to the point where a gay man runs out in front of 30,000 people to play football " and the fact that no professional player has come out in recent years means there are still issues to deal with			1
" but we will come to that day when we do have openly gay players in the top divisions and we 're moving in the right direction			2
