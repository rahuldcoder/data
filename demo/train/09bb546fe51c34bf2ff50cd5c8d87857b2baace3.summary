" @entity15 's remarkable achievements have been acknowledged by his peers with several awards , including a win at @entity32 's @entity72 recognizing his excellence in primary school leadership			1

this is what i tell everybody , especially my children at school : if you want to achieve something , nobody will actually stand in your place			0
it 's you who can turn things around			0
" changing lives @entity15 says one of the ways he manages to ensure his school keeps on achieving great results is to continually upgrade the facility and make sure his pupils have access to competitive teaching materials -- from new display boards and books to functional computers and bigger classrooms			2

" i do n't ask a donation or a sponsorship but i want to partner with this people , " he says			0
" as a partnership , there is a common goal that we want to achieve and that is education			0
and of course many people are eager as long as they see that the school is doing well			0
you 've got to show people how well are you prepared and what is it that you are doing and probably they will assist you			0

" i do n't fold my arms , and then sit and cry , i am going out and doing something , " he says			0
" and it 's only that my resources are limited but i am prepared to go extra mile -- should i get any resource i would make it to the fullest and i think i would be able to change the lives of this community around			0
