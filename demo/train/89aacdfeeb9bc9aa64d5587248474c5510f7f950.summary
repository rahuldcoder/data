-- president @entity1 wrapped up a @entity3 trip dominated by @entity5 's annexation of @entity6 by shifting the focus of the @entity8 and allied response to helping @entity10 rather than confronting @entity11			1
" i 've been very clear in saying that we are going to do everything we can to support @entity10 and the @entity10 people , " @entity1 said thursday at his final @entity3 news conference of the trip , this time in @entity13 with @entity15 prime minister @entity14			1
" but i think it 's also important for us not to promise and then not to be able to deliver			0
" while @entity1 pledged tougher sanctions on @entity5 if president @entity21 continued his expansionist ways , he emphasized steps that do n't involve the @entity5 -- such as thursday 's announcement that the @entity25 would lend @entity10 up to $ 18 billion			1
@entity25 steps in " there are ways for us to hopefully influence @entity5 decision - making and one of the most important things we can do on that front is make sure that the @entity10 government is stable , that its finances are stable , and their elections go forward as currently scheduled , " @entity1 said , adding that " we are going to have to put a lot of resources and a lot of effort " to make all that happen			2
while @entity14 and other @entity3 leaders have pledged a unified response to any further @entity5 expansion efforts , questions remain about whether @entity45 , @entity46 and other nations with significant economic ties to @entity5 would join in threatened sanctions targeting major sectors of the @entity5 economy			1
the @entity1 administration has made the threat of such escalating sanctions the centerpiece of its efforts to get @entity5 to draw down tens of thousands of troops near the @entity10 border and negotiate with @entity59 on territorial issues and ensuring the rights of ethnic @entity5 in @entity10			2
@entity1 acknowledged thursday that expanding sanctions to target @entity5 's financial services , energy , mining , defense and engineering industries would impact @entity8 and @entity3 companies that do business with @entity5 in the connected global economy			1
he hinted at the potential difficulty in getting agreement with @entity3 allies on tougher measures			0
possible expanded sanctions " hopefully we can design sanctions that minimize the impact on @entity8 companies or @entity15 companies and maximize the impact on @entity5 entities , " @entity1 said , later adding : " hopefully we do n't have to use them			1
" " we 're continually hopeful @entity5 walks through the door of diplomacy and works with all of us to try to resolve this issue in a peaceful way , " he said			0
@entity1 was much more expansive on efforts to help @entity10 , calling the @entity25 loan agreement announced thursday " a major step forward " that required political courage because of required reforms aimed at ending a culture of corruption in the nation 's governance and economy			0
" it 's a concrete signal of how the world is united with @entity10 as it makes tough choices at a difficult time , " @entity1 said			0
he called on @entity103 to pass an economic assistance package for @entity10 , something the @entity106 did minutes later to signal a likely compromise with the @entity108 on a final version expected to win approval this week			0
time to hold @entity5 accountable for its aggression asked by reporters about cuts to military spending by @entity3 allies as part of austerity measures , @entity1 said there was a limit			1
military spending cuts " we ca n't have a situation where the @entity8 is consistently spending 3 % of gdp on defense , most of that on @entity3 if we have continuing crises going on in @entity3 , " while @entity3 nations spend just 1 % on defense , he said			1
standing next to @entity1 , @entity14 made an impassioned argument that decisions such as military spending and supporting @entity134 allies involves much more than money			1
the most important value , he said , was " the ideal of democracy and freedom			0
" asked if @entity15 would fully contribute to aiding any threatened @entity134 ally , @entity14 said " the answer is easy , yes			2
" before @entity1 met with @entity14 and toured well - known cultural attractions such as the @entity143 , he went to the @entity144 for talks with @entity146 that he said focused on how to help the disadvantaged			0
" the theme that stitched our conversation together was a belief that in politics and in life , the quality of empathy -- the ability to stand in someone else 's shoes and care for them even if they do n't look like you , talk like you or share your philosophy -- that it 's critical , " @entity1 said in response to a question by @entity0 's @entity153			2
without mentioning the @entity10 crisis , he continued by noting that " it 's the lack of empathy that makes it very easy for us to plunge into wars			0
" @entity1 has said @entity5 has legitimate concerns in @entity6 , which has an ethnic @entity5 majority and is home to a vital @entity5 naval base			2
