-- former @entity2 ceo @entity1 threatened to hit @entity3 with patent litigation if the company did not stop poaching valuable employees , according to a newly unsealed court filing ( hat tip to @entity9 )			1
the document surfaced as part of a lawsuit between former employees of companies like @entity2 , @entity15 , and @entity16 over the companies ' no - poaching agreements ; @entity20 district judge @entity19 denied parts of a request to keep some documents sealed , revealing @entity1 ' comments to @entity3 ceo @entity25			1
according to the document , which was filed late tuesday , both @entity2 and @entity3 hired one another 's employees during @entity25 's tenure between 2003 and 2009			1
@entity25 claims @entity1 called him in august of 2007 — roughly two months after the public launch of the @entity31 — to propose " an agreement " wherein @entity3 and @entity2 would not hire employees away from each other			1
@entity25 's statement notes that the agreement contained a pretty strong " or else " clause : " mr. @entity1 also suggested that if @entity3 did not agree to such an arrangement , @entity3 could face lawsuits alleging infringement of @entity2 's many patents			1
" @entity1 ' yacht impounded over pay dispute @entity25 sent an e-mail response to @entity1 expressing his concern over the discussion			0
" your proposal that we agree that neither company will hire the other 's employees , regardless of the individual 's desires , is not only wrong , it is likely illegal , " @entity25 wrote to @entity1 on august 24 , 2007			1
@entity25 went on to point out that @entity3 recruits employees based on talent , not because @entity3 wants to hurt other companies			2
" threatening @entity3 with a patent lawsuit in response to a decision by one employee to leave @entity2 is just out of line			2
a lawsuit would not serve either of our interests and will not stop employees from migrating between our companies			0
[ ... ] we will both just end up paying a lot of lawyers a lot of money			0
" @entity1 replied a few hours later with a much shorter message			0
" this is not satisfactory to @entity2 , " @entity1 wrote			2
" i 'm sure you realize the asymmetry in the financial resources of our respective companies when you say : ' we will both just end up paying a lot of lawyers a lot of money			0
' " photo : @entity85 as @entity1 in ' @entity86 ' @entity1 ended his letter by suggesting @entity25 " take a look at our patent portfolio before you make a final decision here			0
" as noted by @entity95 , @entity94 's 2011 biography of @entity1 made reference to @entity1 ' anger at @entity3 over the hiring of @entity2 employees , but did not discuss @entity1 ' threat of patent litigation			1
other companies involved in the lawsuit — including @entity2 , @entity104 , @entity15 , @entity16 , @entity105 , and @entity106 — had indeed begun to agree not to cold call each other 's employees at that time			2
the @entity20 @entity110 filed an antitrust lawsuit against the companies and forced them to dissolve the agreements in 2010 , but the current lawsuit is a civil complaint filed by five former employees			0
current @entity2 ceo @entity118 has been ordered by @entity119 to give a deposition about @entity2 's role in the alleged collusion , although @entity2 argues that only @entity1 was involved in the discussion and that @entity118 had no knowledge of the agreements			1
