-- just over 24 hours after @entity1 smashed into the coast of @entity3 just two blocks from their hotel , the three - man team of professional storm chasers knew they had to get out			1
outside , the water was more than waist deep , roads were clogged with debris , and one of their team members , @entity12 , had a deep gash to his leg , inflicted by a jagged piece of sheet metal that sliced into him , unseen beneath the swirling water			1
" on saturday we realized we needed to get the hell out of there as quickly as possible , mostly because of @entity12 's leg , " said @entity21 , founder of @entity22			1
he and @entity12 were joined by @entity27 , who runs @entity28 , a storm chasing site from the @entity30 when the typhoon hit they were working with @entity0 anchor @entity33 and producer @entity34			2
@entity35 struck the capital of @entity37 in the eastern @entity38 early friday morning , creating " blinding rain , absolutely ferocious winds ( and ) deafening sounds , " @entity21 said			1
" @entity42 were blowing out , water was cascading down the staircases in the hotel , flooding all the rooms			0
" after a couple of hours , the storm surge hit , flooding the hotel 's ground floor before conditions eased enough to venture outside			1
dazed survivors with cuts and bruises searched for anything they could salvage beneath the wreck of their homes			2
however , @entity21 said on day two , some were raiding abandoned shops for food and water			1
pharmacies were being targeted , presumably for medication			0
he also saw some people carrying electrical appliances , useless in a town without electricity and covered in water			0
" people in the @entity38 are great and they 're tough and they 're good at fending for themselves			0
but the problem is in a situation like that , the more desperate people become for food and water , the more desperate their actions become , " he said			0
a sense of foreboding was starting to set in , @entity21 said , as people started to realize that everything they had and knew had been wiped out			1
" in the immediate aftermath i got the sense that a lot of people did n't quite realize how serious the situation was and how badly it would escalate , " he said			0
" whilst we did n't personally feel threatened you could just sense it would n't take much			0
" " i remember at one point looking at the security guard in the hotel and it was n't because of any specific threat , but he had his gun in his hand , and he looked like he was anxious and preparing himself for something , and that was unnerving for me			0
" back at their flooded hotel , the team planned a way to get out			2
they 'd chosen the @entity101 because of its height -- at four stories it was one of the tallest buildings in @entity3 and they could see the airport from the roof			1
@entity108 : @entity110 's impact they could also see kilometer after kilometer of flattened buildings and debris covering roads turning what is normally a six to seven kilometer car ride to the airport into potentially a seven - hour trek over collapsed buildings and trees			1
they were in their hotel room when they heard planes fly overhead			0
" we rushed out of the room , sprinted up to the roof and watched the planes fly over the city			0
we were begging them , ' please land , please , ' because we did n't know the state of the airport			0
when we saw one of the planes land , we thought , right , ok the airport 's a viable option			2
" @entity21 and @entity27 set out , leaving an injured @entity12 back at the hotel			1
they had handheld radios and within half an hour a call came from @entity12			0
he 'd learned of another way out : a military staging post where the airforce was flying people out			2
@entity145 : looking for loved ones " it was so uncertain -- we did n't want to give up our hotel room and food supplies because if we got to the staging post and they said sorry we could n't help you we would have been in big trouble , " @entity21 said			1
leaving behind most of their belongings , they carried the bare minimum to the military checkpoint where they registered their names and were told : " yes , you can get out on an air force flight but you have to make your own way to their airport			2
" at that moment , a man @entity21 describes only as a general piped up : " there is a helicopter coming , come with me			1
" " we ran with him , " @entity21 said			1
" the chopper landed and we scrambled onto it and got ferried to the airport			0
" from there they boarded a @entity178 with other survivors , and the bagged corpses of four people who did n't make it			1
they landed in @entity184 and caught flights out of the @entity38			0
@entity12 is currently being treated in hospital in @entity187			0
back in @entity188 , @entity21 said it was clear the people of @entity3 had no idea of what was coming			1
" the @entity38 is n't used to getting storm surges -- it 's not usually such of an issue so this would have caught people by surprise			2
they do n't associate typhoons with the rising water levels like that			0
" the day before , his team had bought enough food and water for one week			2
there were no queues and shelves were well stocked			0
" it was like a usual day at the supermarket , " @entity21 said			1
asked whether he thought the message had got out that the storm could be the biggest ever to make landfall , he said , " no , no , it ca n't have done			2
