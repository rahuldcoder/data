@entity0 -- the federal government unveiled new proposed regulations wednesday mandating " bolder health warnings " on cigarette advertisements and packages , according to a news release from the @entity5			1
the proposed requirements , characterized as the biggest change in tobacco health warnings in 25 years , include " nine new larger and more noticeable textual warning statements and color graphic images depicting the negative health consequences of smoking , " the release stated			1
the public will have an opportunity to weigh in on 36 proposed images through january 9			0
assuming the plan moves forward as scheduled , @entity22 officials will select the nine statements and images to be used no later than june 22			0
rules requiring the use of the new images and warnings on all cigarettes distributed for sale in the @entity32 would take effect by october 22 , 2012			1
" today , @entity22 takes a crucial step toward reducing the tremendous toll of illness and death caused by tobacco use by proposing to dramatically change how cigarette packages and advertising look in this country , " @entity22 commissioner @entity39 said			1
" when the rule takes effect , the health consequences of smoking will be obvious every time someone picks up a pack of cigarettes			0
... this is a concrete example of how @entity22 's new responsibilities for tobacco product regulation can benefit the public 's health			2
" @entity55 , the president of the campaign for @entity57 , called the proposed changes " the most significant change in @entity32 cigarette warnings since they were first required in 1965			1
" anti-tobacco advocate @entity62 praised the new warnings			1
" it 's about time , " he told @entity1 in a telephone interview			0
" @entity67 has had similar labels for at least five years and they 've been very effective in reducing consumption there			1
it 's an absolutely costless way to get information to people in a way that they will actually pay attention to it			0
" the law professor at @entity77 in @entity78 , @entity79 , and president of the @entity81 said current warning labels " are unread , as as far as anyone can tell ... it 's not going to be possible to ignore the new ones			1
" the change became possible last year , he said , when @entity88 gave the @entity22 the broad power to regulate tobacco products			2
before that , " everything that was done had to be done by a vote of @entity88			0
" @entity94 was more blunt about why it had taken so long to effect change in the @entity32			0
" it 's because the tobacco companies have a lot of muscles , " the professor of medicine at the @entity99 told @entity1 in a telephone interview			2
" and because they give loads and loads and loads of money to politicians			0
" under the current labeling , the @entity32 " has the weakest warning labels in the world , " @entity94 said			1
@entity94 , who also directs the @entity114 at @entity99 , predicted that some tobacco companies " almost certainly " are going to sue claiming that publishing the warnings would prove too onerous			2
in a statement , @entity117 said it supported several of the initiatives cited by @entity5 regarding tobacco issues			2
" @entity117 has actively participated in the @entity22 's rule - making and public comment processes and plans to do the same on this proposal , " it said			0
but @entity124 , a spokesman for @entity125 , said the legality of requiring larger , graphic warnings on cigarette packages was already the subject of a lawsuit filed by the maker of @entity133 and @entity134 cigarettes			1
the suit alleges that the warnings violate the company 's first amendment rights of commercial , free speech , @entity124 told @entity1 in a telephone interview			0
" seizing half of our packaging , devaluing our trademarks , we 're challenging that , " he said			0
though the suit was rejected last year in federal district court in @entity149 , @entity150 , the company has appealed to the @entity151 , which is expected to take up the matter next year , @entity124 said			2
tobacco use , according to the federal government , causes 443,000 deaths in the @entity32 each year and remains the leading cause of premature and preventable death nationwide			1
an estimated 30 percent of all cancer deaths are related to tobacco use , health officials say			0
in the @entity32 , smokers number 46 million -- including 20.6 percent of adults and 19.5 percent of high school students , according to the federal government			1
@entity1 's @entity164 contributed to this story .			0
