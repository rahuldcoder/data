-- you do n't expect while lecturing about politics on a ship to become a political pawn in a two hundred year - old territorial dispute , but that is what has happened to me and several thousand other passengers who cruised into the middle of the renewed spat between @entity12 and @entity13 over who should control the @entity15			1
this week two cruise liners flying @entity12 colony flags -- the 750 - passenger @entity18 and 2,600 passenger @entity19 -- were denied permission to dock in the @entity13 port of @entity22 because the ships had previously called in at @entity24 in the @entity15			1
both vessels had visited @entity24 in the @entity15 on saturday , february 25 as part of their widely advertised and published schedules			2
the @entity18 left the @entity13 capital of @entity29 late at night on february 20 , later than was intended as the result of what was explained as industrial action by tugmen			0
i joined the @entity35 at the @entity37 terminal in @entity29 with an almost total absence of customs and immigration formalities			0
i 'd flown into town the day before without incident , so there was no advance warning of any potential threat or the action to come			0
we were due to proceed from @entity24 in the @entity15 to the world 's southernmost city , the @entity13 port of @entity48 , on february 27 , having passed @entity52 on the way			1
but early that morning , at around 6:00 a.m. , the @entity55 's commanding office captain @entity56 announced to passengers that he and the @entity59 pilots already on board the vessel to help chart it through the @entity64 archipelago had been informed that the mayor of @entity48 was refusing to allow the @entity55 into port			2
we would therefore be carrying on earlier than had been intended to the @entity59 port of @entity68			0
the explanation given from @entity48 was that the ban was being imposed because the @entity18 had previously called at the @entity15 , which @entity13 refers to as @entity15			1
no advance warning had been given that such action would be taken if the @entity18 did call at the @entity15 , as around 20 cruise ships a month do in this summer season in the southern hemisphere			2
the vast majority of the passengers on the @entity55 are @entity12			1
the @entity18 left @entity77 on january 13 on an 87 - day journey around @entity79			1
it was only after the vessel left @entity77 that the latest @entity83 - @entity13 spat over the @entity15 hotted up with news that the @entity85 -- or flight lieutenant @entity86 as he is known in his role as a @entity90 helicopter pilot -- was undertaking a six - week tour of duty in the @entity15 on what the @entity92 insists is a routine deployment			1
this triggered protests from the @entity13 government , as did the news that @entity12 was dispatching to the @entity100 @entity99 , a type 45 destroyer , which is its most sophisticated warship armed with missiles which could if required take out much of the @entity13 air force			1
@entity13 has protested at what it calls a militarization of the area			0
it has to be said that the mayor of @entity48 's action , which would have cost his city dearly as the spending power of some 3,000 cruise passengers on the two ships was not unleashed , has been taken phlegmatically by the @entity55 's passengers			1
the only thing that people had to check themselves from saying was " oh well , it is n't the @entity119 " because it is precisely that which @entity48 advertises itself as being			0
many passengers were looking forward to acquiring souvenirs which proclaimed that that was where they had been			0
cruise ship passengers with any company are accustomed to schedules being changed at short notice , whether it is as a result of storms , fogs , strikes or political events			0
on the current voyage the @entity55 had to spend an extra day in @entity138 to await delayed supplies and it missed one scheduled call in @entity141 because of a local police strike which might have made it risky for passengers to go ashore			2
from the explanation given by @entity13 embassy personnel in some countries it seems that the mayor of @entity48 may have somewhat over-interpreted his brief			0
the @entity13 government , they confirmed , had banned the refuelling and bunkering in @entity13 ports of oil exploration vessels and other commercial shipping which has previously visited the @entity15			1
according to those embassy sources there was allegedly no ban affecting individuals who had been to the @entity15 visiting @entity13 , but that rather begs the question of how the individuals would get to and from @entity24			2
precious few of us can walk on water			0
@entity13 's @entity167 president @entity167 has been largely responsible for raising the temperature over the @entity15 as the 30th anniversary of the successful war undertaken by @entity173 's @entity172 government to regain the islands after the invasion by @entity13 's military junta approaches			1
voted back into office with 54 % support only three months ago , president @entity167 dismisses @entity12 as " a coarse and decadent colonial power " and is appealing to other @entity79 countries to join her in isolating the @entity15 while they remain under @entity12 control			1
her latest action , now supplemented by calls for a boycott of @entity12 goods by @entity13 , will raise an intriguing dilemma for tour companies			2
a visit to the @entity15 is one of the biggest draws for @entity12 booking cruises around @entity79			1
but if a call at @entity24 is going to lead to the cruise ships being banned from @entity13 ports , and perhaps eventually ports in other @entity79 countries , how long will they keep @entity24 on their itineraries ? intriguingly , as i was wandering around @entity29 the other day i came across the memorial to the @entity13 who lost their lives in what they call the @entity100			1
in @entity206 a tour guide was giving his version of the events 30 years ago			0
" the generals were in charge here , " he said , " and they told us that we were a strong and well - armed nation			0
the @entity12 had a lot more practice than us at fighting warsâ € ” and we lost			0
" the @entity15 , he said , belonged to @entity13 " geographically , " an argument i suppose which could be used to claim that @entity222 " belonged " to the @entity223			2
so what about the @entity225 themselves , said one of his listeners , was n't it up to them to decide who they wanted to belong to ? that did n't appeal to the guide			0
" ah well , " he replied , " if you had a choice between voting to be rich and voting to be poor , which way would you vote ? "			0
