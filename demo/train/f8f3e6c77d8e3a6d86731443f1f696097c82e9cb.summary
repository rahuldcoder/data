a @entity1 teenager , who has only just turned 16 , generated the second highest volume of tweets during the january transfer window			1
which means either that @entity7 , who joined @entity9 champions @entity8 , is an even better footballer than is being touted , or the january transfer window was very , very quiet			1
@entity12 's move from @entity14 club @entity13 to @entity15 team @entity10 was the most discussed on @entity16 , with former @entity18 goalkeeper @entity17 , who signed for @entity19 , the third most tweeted move			1
the transfers of @entity22 and @entity17 had the knock on effect of boosting the @entity16 following of both players , with the @entity28 international adding 100,000 followers and @entity17 gaining 145,000			0
@entity7 has has only tweeted 80 times , but already he 's collected 102,000 followers			2
meanwhile a predicted flurry of late big - money deals failed to materialize as this january window saw spending remain at last year 's level , with £ 130 million ( $ 195m ) lavished , way down on the record , set in the 2010/11 season , of £ 225m ( $ 338m )			1
despite the relatively demure january figures , this has still been a record - breaking season in @entity42 's top flight , as its 20 clubs flexed their financial muscles			0
an estimated £ 950 million ( $ 1.4 billion ) has been spent on recruitment by @entity15 's clubs this term , according to the sports business group at @entity49			2
that is up on the previous benchmark , set last season , at £ 760 million ( $ 1.1 bn ) and is driven by the bumper revenue handed to each club thanks to the huge deals struck for domestic and overseas television rights			0
the three - year deal , which began at the start of last season , is worth £ 6.2 billion ( $ 9.4 bn ) and played a large part in the record revenue delivered by @entity15 clubs in the 2012 - 13 season , £ 2.7 billion ( $ 4.19 bn )			1
this wealth was reflected in @entity49 's annual list of the world 's richest clubs in which @entity42 had five in the top 10 , eight in the top 20 , and all 20 of its teams represented in the top 40			0
@entity19 were second only to @entity8 in the rich list , recording revenue of £ 399 million ( $ 602m ) while @entity72 , @entity10 , @entity73 and @entity74 also made the top 10			0
a whopping £ 835 million ( $ 1.25 bn ) was spent in the @entity15 before the summer transfer window closed on september 1 , @entity19 accounting for about £ 150 million ( $ 226m ) of that themselves			1
its purchase of @entity81 from @entity8 cost £ 59.7 million ( $ 90m ) alone			0
that was 30 per cent up on the previous high , set during the same period the season before as £ 630 million ( $ 949 bn ) was put down			0
but while the final hours of august counted as a multi-million pound thrill ride for supporters , january was , in contrast , a snooze fest. " given the record level of spending seen in the summer , it is not entirely surprising that we have n't seen a new record for the january window , " said @entity49 's @entity88 in statement			1
" however , with all @entity15 clubs recording record revenues , we might have expected one or two more major deals in this window			0
" despite the relative restraint we have seen in the january window , 2014/15 is still a record season for @entity15 spending			2
" last season saw @entity15 spending surpass the £ 700m threshold for the first time , and the revenue growth at @entity15 clubs is such that they have been able to record a combined transfer spend this season of over £ 950m			2
