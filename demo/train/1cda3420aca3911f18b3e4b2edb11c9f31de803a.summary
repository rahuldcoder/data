@entity0 , @entity1 -- i 've eaten some unusual things on the road			1
there were salted @entity8 worms in @entity9 at the hotel buffet ( black and squishy ) ; sun - dried nsenene grasshoppers in @entity13 ( yellow and juicy ) ; whole roasted goat in the desert in @entity17 ( delicious ) , and chicken head and feet soup in @entity19 ( only unusual if you are not from @entity1 )			1
officially , my travel advice to you is this well - worn phrase : if you ca n't boil it , cook it or peel it , then do n't eat it			2
but between you , me , and the screen , sometimes it 's best to put the energy bars and canned nuts aside and feed your culinary curiosity			1
that 's just what i was challenged to do when i visited a thriving cockroach farm in @entity0 , @entity1			1
but more on that later			2
an appetite for adventure some of my favorite travel experiences have been of eating street food or home - cooked delicacies that i have never heard of before			1
after 10 hours in the desert sun , chicken barbequed on a coal fire in @entity47 tastes like a @entity50 - starred offering			2
and i do n't know what the guy put into his pot of chicken and broth in the foothills of the @entity57 , but it was worth choking on the smoke from the stove inside his hut			2
there are pitfalls for the adventurous eater			2
i have yet to meet a journalist with a well - worn passport who has n't had a bout or two of gut - wrenching giardiasis ( i will spare you the details )			2
and sometimes you do regret a culinary decision ( goat - bile on the shores of @entity76 , i 'm talking to you )			1
occasionally , it 's best to say " no " -- so i declined the dried mice in @entity79 skewered on a stick and offered by the side of the highway , despite the insistence of our producer			1
which all gets me , in a roundabout way , to @entity88 , the kingpin of cockroaches in @entity0 , @entity1			1
scuttling legs @entity88 has a dream : to put roaches on plates and bowls throughout @entity1 as a high protein meal			1
" i love these cockroaches , i feel very close to them , " he tells me			1
in a tumble - down industrial district on the shabby outskirts of @entity0 , @entity88 farms millions of cockroaches			1
ten million before " harvest time , " he tells me			0
he keeps the roaches in warehouses with narrow corridors and hives made of cement roof shingles			0
stepping inside is like a waking nightmare or a scene from the film " @entity110			0
" there 's a strong smell of ammonia and the sound of scuttling legs			1
@entity88 breeds @entity117 cockroaches ( actually , they 're originally from @entity118 ) and he sells them to pharmaceutical companies in @entity1 by the ton			1
they are usually ground and stuffed into pills and advertised as a cure for all manner of stomach , heart , and liver ailments			0
in recent years , they have become a staple in @entity1 medicine shops here , promising wondrous results			1
cockroach medicine is having something of a boom			1
crunchy , with an aftertaste but @entity88 prefers them fresh and wants me to try one , so he drags a gas stove into his office and throws a steel bowl full of roaches into peanut oil			0
he promptly scoops them out			0
" is that it ? " i ask			0
" no , twice fried , " he says , throwing them back into the oil			0
after which , @entity88 promptly starts tucking in			0
he really seems to enjoy it			0
" i felt so much better after i started eating cockroaches , " he says			1
now , all that is left is for me to try one			0
@entity88 points out a suitable roach on the corner of the dish			0
" its wings have come off , so it 's easier to eat , " he says			2
i pop it in my mouth and chew -- @entity117 roaches are , unfortunately , too big to swallow whole			0
they 're crunchy , like a spindly overcooked @entity170 fry , and they leave an aftertaste that has serious staying power			0
i realize that roaches may not be the best way to convince you to be an adventurous eater , but think of them as the standard bearer			0
or take @entity88 's word for it			2
" if you do n't try it , you will regret it for the rest of your life , " he exclaims .			0

@entity2 's @entity188 has tasted everything from worms to grasshoppers while on the road
@entity1 's cockroaches are his latest culinary adventure
