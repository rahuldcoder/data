doctors are looking for more information about a " polio - like syndrome " that has caused paralysis in a few children in @entity5			1
neurologists have identified five patients who developed paralysis in one or more of their limbs between august 2012 and july 2013			1
all five children had been vaccinated against the poliovirus			2
@entity12 did not seem to help the children regain their motor function			2
samples from two of the children tested positive for enterovirus 68 , a rare virus that has been linked to severe respiratory illness in the past			1
samples from the other three children were not collected or tested soon enough to yield conclusive results , said dr. @entity25 , a neurologist at the @entity26 , @entity27			1
@entity25 and her colleagues will present a case report about these patients ' illnesses at the @entity33 's annual meeting in late april			0
they are asking health care providers to be on the lookout for similar cases and send in samples from any patient exhibiting these symptoms			2
dr. @entity41 , chief of the @entity42 at the @entity43 , said the state is aware of the paralysis cases but believes the risk to families is very low			1
" we are evaluating cases as they are reported to us , " @entity41 said in an e-mail to @entity49			0
" we have not found anything at this point that raises any public health concerns			2
" the poliovirus has been eradicated in the @entity56 for more than 30 years			1
only three countries in the world are not yet free of the disease : @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62 , according to the @entity63			0
why polio has n't gone away yet poliovirus is part of the @entity68 family , which also includes enteroviruses and rhinoviruses ( better known as the common cold )			2
there are more than 100 types of enterovirus that cause 10 million to 15 million infections in the @entity56 each year , according to the @entity76			1
most people who become infected with an enterovirus do not get sick or experience only mild symptoms , said dr. @entity80 , chief of the @entity81 and @entity82 at the @entity76			2
common symptoms include fever , runny nose , cough , skin rash and body aches			0
@entity89 is often the cause of " summer colds , " whose cases spike in july , august and september			0
children and teens are more likely to fall ill because they have not yet built up immunity to these common viruses			2
however , some types of enterovirus are more serious			2
these can cause hand , foot and mouth disease ; viral meningitis ; encephalitis ( inflammation of the brain ) ; an infection of the heart ; and paralysis in some patients			0
@entity89 68 was first identified in a @entity5 lab in 1962 , after four children came down with a severe respiratory illness			1
between 1970 and 2005 , only 26 cases of enterovirus 68 in the @entity56 were reported to the @entity76			1
since 2000 , the government agency has kept a closer watch and has seen 47 cases , @entity80 said			0
outbreaks have occurred over the years in @entity119 and @entity120 , but it 's still one of the rarest types of enterovirus			0
more common -- and more concerning to health officials -- is enterovirus 71 , which was discovered by the same @entity5 lab in 1969 , @entity80 said			1
enterovirus 71 is usually associated with severe neurological issues , including aseptic meningitis , polio - like paralysis and encephalitis			1
@entity25 is not sure if the samples from this latest group of patients were tested for enterovirus 71			1
according to a @entity76 report , several outbreaks of paralysis caused by enterovirus 71 were seen in @entity120 in the 1960s and 1970s			1
in the late 1990s and early 2000s , fatal encephalitis was a big problem in @entity143 and @entity144			0
" ever since then , the virus has circulated in high levels in @entity119 , " @entity80 said			0
in recent years , the outbreaks have spread to @entity148 ; a cluster of cases near @entity151 drew media attention in 2013			0
between 1983 and 2005 , 270 cases of enterovirus 71 were reported in the @entity56			1
but none has resulted in a larger outbreak , despite the virus 's infectious nature			0
" that 's the really odd thing , " @entity80 said			0
" we see cases from time to time in the @entity56			1
occasionally they 'll be severe			0
basically it 's identical to what 's circulating in @entity119 ... but it does n't cause the same big outbreak in disease			0
and we really do n't know why			0
" the @entity76 is aware of the small cluster of cases in @entity5 but is not actively involved in an investigation , a spokesman told @entity49			1
@entity25 and her colleagues do n't want to alarm anyone with their case report presentation ; they 're simply seeking help in finding the cause of these seemingly connected cases			0
" we would like to stress that this syndrome appears to be very , very rare , " one of @entity25 's colleagues , dr. @entity181 , said in a prepared statement			2
parents need to know that vaccination is key to preventing polio from returning to the @entity56 , @entity41 said			1
while there is no vaccine to protect you from a non-polio enterovirus , washing your hands frequently and avoiding close contact with others who are sick can help .			0

five children in @entity5 have a " polio - like syndrome , " according to neurologists
two of the children tested positive for enterovirus 68 , a rare type of enterovirus
another type , enterovirus 71 , is more commonly linked to paralysis
both are uncommon in the @entity56 ; state health officials say risk is very low
