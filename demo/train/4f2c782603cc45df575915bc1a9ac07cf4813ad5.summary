@entity0 -- a form of liquid morphine used by terminally ill patients will remain on the market even though it is an " unapproved drug , " according to a decision by the @entity7			1
last month , the @entity7 warned nine companies to stop selling unapproved pain - relief drugs			1
after talking with hospital and hospice organizations , which expressed concern that taking the product off the market would result in hardship for terminally ill patients and their caregivers , the agency decided to extend the usage of morphine sulfate oral solution 20 mg / ml. the agency wants to ensure there is no shortage of the drug while patients wait for an approved product to take its place			1
" while the @entity7 remains committed to ultimately ensuring that all prescription drugs on the market are @entity7 approved , we have to balance that goal with flexibility and compassion for patients who have a few alternatives for the alleviation of their pain , " dr. @entity29 , deputy director of the @entity7 's @entity30 , said thursday			1
" in light of the concerns raised by these patients and their health - care providers , we have adjusted our actions with regard to these particular products			0
" last month , the @entity7 sent warning letters to nine companies telling them to stop manufacturing 14 unapproved narcotics that are widely used to treat pain			0
seven of those companies made or distributed the oral morphine			0
the morphine elixir is widely used by terminal patients in hospital and home hospice care settings and is manufactured by @entity57 , @entity58 , @entity59 and @entity60 in its warning letter last month , the agency gave the companies 60 days to stop manufacturing the drug before enforcement action was taken			2
thursday 's announcement did not prompt immediate reactions from the companies			0
a spokesman for @entity60 said the firm did not have all the details of the decision			0
other companies did not immediately return calls from @entity1			0
the @entity7 estimates there are several thousand drugs , mostly older products , marketed illegally without @entity7 approval in this country			1
once an illegally marketed drug is identified , enforcement action begins because the agency does not have information on the quality of these drugs and has not had an opportunity to approve their labeling			0
in 1976 the agency began a program to bring companies manufacturing these drugs into compliance			0
thursday 's announcement applies only to the morphine sulfate elixir 20mg/ml , and the warning letters sent to the other product manufacturers are still in effect			2
currently there are no approved morphine sulfate oral solution 20mg/ml products on the market			1
until there are , the @entity7 says it will allow companies making and distributing the unapproved drugs to continue , until 180 days after any company receives approval to manufacture a new morphine replacement drug of the same dosage			1
the @entity7 says it expects all companies marketing unapproved drugs to submit the necessary applications to get approval for those drugs .			2
