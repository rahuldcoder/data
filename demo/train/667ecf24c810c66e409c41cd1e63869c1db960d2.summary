-- motorists in @entity2 , beware : speeding is in the eye of the beholder , especially when police are the ones guesstimating			2
the @entity8 has ruled a trained officer 's " visual estimation " of a vehicle going over the posted speed limit is enough to convict a motorist			1

" that man was cited for going nearly 20 mph over the posted limit			0
the state high court by a 5 - 1 vote said a trained officer 's guess was , by itself , enough to allow a ticket for speeding			1
" a police officer 's unaided visual estimation of a vehicle 's speed is sufficient evidence to support a conviction for speeding in violation of [ state law ] without independent verification of the vehicle 's speed if the officer is trained , is certified by the @entity43 or a similar organization that develops and implements training programs to meet the needs of the communities they serve , " wrote the state justices			1
the said a radar gun was '' not necessary to support a conviction for speeding			0
'' the case involved @entity53 , who was traveling along @entity54 near @entity55 two years ago in his black suv			0

at trial , the officer testified the radar unit he was using at the time clocked the vehicle at 82 mph but that reading was tossed by the judge after @entity57 could not producer a copy of his radar - training certificate when requested			1
@entity57 -- who said he had performed " hundreds " of past visual estimations -- claimed he cited @entity53 for only 79 mph " to give him a break on the personal appearance in court			2
" the judge in upholding the conviction concluded the officer 's " strongest " testimony was his visual estimation , but amended the citation to say @entity53 was only going 70 mph			1
for his part , @entity53 said he was not speeding and that the real culprit was a tractor - trailer that was passing his suv at the time			0
@entity58 police defended their officer 's actions			1
" officers can rely on their unaided visual estimation of a vehicle 's speed , but the intent is not to allow officers to routinely issue tickets based solely upon unaided visual observations , " said chief @entity90			1
@entity99 , the attorney representing @entity53 , said the decision " stinks " and expressed disappointment the state court did not rule on his main point -- when radar readings are disqualified , visual estimations should also be dismissed			2
'' i 'm really surprised , '' @entity99 said			0
'' i never expected the ruling to come out this way			0
'' @entity53 paid the $ 177 fine , and his lawyer says he has no further plans to appeal			0
