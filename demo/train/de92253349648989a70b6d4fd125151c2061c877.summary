@entity0 is releasing its latest operating system for the @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4 today			1
the system , @entity5 7 , will come installed on the new @entity7 and @entity8 models that go on sale friday			1
owners of some older @entity0 devices also can download it to replace their current systems			1
but should they ? before you jump in and upgrade , here 's what you need to know about @entity5			1
what is @entity5 ? @entity0 's @entity5 is the software that controls all the basics of your gadget , including the look , feel , settings and hardware			1
@entity5 is @entity0 's latest update to this system and its biggest change since @entity5 debuted six years ago			1
@entity27 leaves beta , enters manhood what time is the @entity5 download available ? developers have been testing early versions of the new operating system for months , but @entity0 made it available to the general public at 1 p.m. et today			1
to see whether it is available , go to settings > general > software update on your device , or visit @entity41 on your computer			2
how is it different from what 's already on my @entity2 or @entity3 ? six years is a long time to wear the same look			1
@entity0 's @entity47 has received a major design overhaul in this version and now has a more streamlined , flat , abstract look			1
the typography is all new , and nice touches like transparency and subtle animations abound			0
there are also a handful of new features , though some are not available on all older devices			1
here are a few of the biggies : a new time - saving control center slides up from the bottom of the screen for easy access to basic settings such as brightness and @entity68			2
it has shortcuts for the flashlight , timer , calculator and camera			0
an updated notification center now shows a summary of what you have in store for the day and details on the weather and your commute			0
the camera adds a square - photo option and new filters , while the photos app drops the map view and sorts your images into events by date and location			2
it adds @entity93 , a feature for people who use @entity96 that makes it easier to move photos and files between computers and mobile devices			2
the @entity27 voice - search tool adds an option for male voice , defaults to @entity105 for web searches and pulls in results from @entity108 and @entity109			2
the same double - click of the home button now zooms you out to show a carousel of mini versions of all your open apps			2
@entity5 wo n't require a great deal of re-learning			1
the basic layout and functions are the same : the home screen is still a grid of icons , there 's a dock with your favorite apps at the bottom , and the gestures you 've become used to work the same			1
there will probably be some initial confusion as you struggle to re-identify all the new icons , but a proper upgrade should leave them all in the same spots they were in before			0
new iphones : the reviews are in can i update my @entity2 / @entity3 / @entity4 ? although @entity47 is coming out the same time as a pair of brand new @entity2 models , it can also be installed for free on some older devices			1
at the press event announcing the new models , @entity0 ceo @entity144 said there were 600 million devices running @entity5			1
just because you have a year - old @entity149 does n't mean you ca n't freshen it up with the latest operating system			1
look for your device below to see whether it is eligible			0
@entity2 ( original ) : no @entity154 : no @entity155 : no iphone 4 : yes			0
does not include @entity93 , @entity27 or camera filters ( you can add filters later in the photos app )			2
includes all new @entity5 features			1
@entity4 : only the 5th - generation @entity4 can upgrade but will include all new @entity5 features			1
@entity3 ( original ) : no ipad 2 : yes			2
no @entity93 , @entity27 , camera filters or square format , or @entity168 app filters			0
@entity3 3rd generation : yes			2
no @entity93 or camera filters			0
@entity3 4th generation : yes @entity172 : yes some of the cooler new features you may have heard about , like the @entity176 fingerprint sensor and the new camera tools -- slow - motion , burst mode and image - stabilization -- are available only on the new @entity181			1
should i update ? just because your device is compatible does n't mean it should be upgraded right away			0
once you update your device to @entity5 , there is no going back to @entity186 or whichever earlier @entity47 you were running			1
( yes , there are unofficial ways to downgrade , but these are not recommended for regular @entity2 and @entity3 users			2
) if you are not in a rush , wait a few weeks or months until @entity0 releases the first updated version of @entity5			1
the early releases of the operation system can include bugs that should be addressed with subsequent @entity5 updates			1
let other eager people spend the next few weeks finding and reporting these issues so you do n't have to deal with them			0
older devices can experience frustrating performance issues when upgraded to a new os. @entity203 software was designed specifically for the hardware that 's faster than your trusty old @entity2			1
if your device is anything older than the most recent generation , it might suddenly slow down , and battery life can suffer			2
this should not be as much of a problem for newer devices , such as the @entity149 , 4th generation @entity3 and @entity172 , or the latest @entity4			1
if you are worried about performance issues , skip the update			0
updating immediately is recommended only for tech - savvy early adopters who are comfortable with the risks			1
are there any downsides of not updating ? immediately , not much			0
you wo n't have the new features to play with , but your phone will continue to work as it always did			2
in the long run , there could be a few drawbacks			0
@entity0 has been pushing developers to update their apps to be @entity5 7 compatible			1
the updates can be as minor as changing the look of an icon or as major as adding all new features			0
many developers may stop updating and supporting older versions of their apps as they move their focus to @entity5			1
that means eventually , you could be stuck with out - of - date ( or even non-working ) versions of your favorite apps			0
i 'm going for it ! how do i upgrade ? 1			0
back up : before you make the leap , it is very important that you back up your @entity2 or @entity3			2
there is always a small chance your device could be wiped clean in the upgrade process , so make a full backup of everything			0
to back up , plug your device into your computer , open @entity41 , and if it does not start backing up automatically , click the " @entity252 " button			0
if your photos are not set to back up automatically , use @entity254 or @entity2 on a @entity255 and @entity256 on a @entity257 to make copies of all your pictures			0
another option is to skip the cord and back up to @entity96 over @entity262			0
on your device , go to @entity263			0
tap the " @entity264 " button			0
2 : download the new @entity47 : you can get the update by plugging into a computer and opening @entity41 ( this is the faster option ) or over a @entity262 connection directly to your phone			0
if @entity41 does n't automatically ask whether you 'd like to upgrade when you plug in , click " @entity274 " in the summary tab			0
it will do the rest automatically			0
from your phone , go to @entity263 > @entity277 and click the install button			0
make sure your phone is fully charged and connected to a @entity262 , not your cellular network .			0

@entity0 's latest operating system for @entity282 and @entity3 was released *wednesday*
@entity5 is available for some older devices , but not all features will work
a new os can include bugs or slow down older devices
unless you are eager and tech - savvy , you probably should wait to update
