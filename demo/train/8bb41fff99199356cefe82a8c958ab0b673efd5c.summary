-- winning the @entity1 may be one of sport 's toughest challenges but last year 's winner @entity5 believes the current generation of cyclists have an equally arduous task ahead of them			1
through an accident of timing , the @entity10 says today 's best racers are constantly having to prove to the world that they are riding clean			1
this is because they are unfortunate enough to follow an era where some of the biggest names in sport repeatedly shattered the illusions of cycling fans by failing doping tests			2
" it 's a challenge for the new generation of cyclists to be able to show people that the sport really has turned around -- and that doping is not something that 's done any more , " he told @entity24			1
" the pressure falls on us now			0
it 's our burden but it does fall on us to tell people that the sport is no longer how it used to be			2
" the state of affairs is such that a virtuoso @entity5 display on the @entity41 stage of the @entity42 did not receive wholehearted sporting acclaim but was forensically examined for evidence of cheating instead			2
the whispering and rumors were only silenced when @entity5 's @entity47 allowed @entity49 newspaper @entity48 to study data from 18 of the @entity10 's previous climbs			1
" i 'm glad i was able to take on the questions , " @entity5 told @entity0 at the time , shortly after a sports science expert found the data to be consistent with doping - free riding			1
" i know what i 've done to get here and i 've nothing to hide			0
" nonetheless , some riders still do fall prey to the temptations of yesteryear -- as proven when @entity64 's @entity63 was banned from the sport for life in december after being found guilty of a third doping offense			2
two months ago , the president of the @entity69 ( @entity69 ) -- @entity70 -- created the @entity71 ( @entity71 ) with the intention of investigating both historic doping in cycling and allegations that the @entity69 had been involved in previous wrongdoing			2
the world governing body came under intense pressure last year after failing to detect the behavior of @entity82 @entity81 , who famously won seven @entity1 races only to reveal that he had been doping throughout in an interview in january 2013			1
" we can all agree that the @entity81 affair has done immense damage to our sport , " @entity70 , who ousted controversial leader @entity85 last september , told @entity0 in february			0
" @entity81 wants to be first through the door when the @entity71 is up and running , and i urge him and anyone else to participate			0
" with the case set to turn up the sport 's unwanted past once again , the @entity93 - born @entity5 is realistic that the issue is one he will have to address time and again			1
" it is going to be a question that is going to be asked for the foreseeable future , just because it has been such a big part of cycling and the results in cycling over the past decade , " he said			1
" naturally , it 's a question that we are going to have to face			0
" tour of @entity108 ? on a personal level , the other topic that will repeatedly come his way is whether he can retain the title he won so convincingly last year			0
last month , he won the @entity115 -- which may prove an omen for some since @entity5 also won it in 2013			1
however , the rider himself is just delighted that he is in good shape to scale the many mountains -- both real and metaphorical -- heading his way			0
" i 'm in a very similar kind of condition to what i was last year just after the winter , " the 28 - year - old said			0
" @entity127 is always a really good test to see how the winter training has been and how things have gone through the winter			0
so to come away with the title again is fantastic , a really good way to start the season			0

@entity5 says current generation have to prove that cycling is now a clean sport
@entity10 describes the challenge as " our burden "
2013 @entity1 winner believes questions will continue for the " foreseeable future "
