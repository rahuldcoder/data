the proposal will be examined by a committee of experts and is expected to be adopted into law , @entity22 said			2

@entity95 spoke a day after a @entity94 fact - finding mission announced that it has found @entity5 guilty of multiple human rights violations and indicated that it may be time for the @entity105 to become involved			1
