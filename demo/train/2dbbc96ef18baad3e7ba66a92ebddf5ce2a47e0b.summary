-- it was a big applause line , one of many for former president @entity3 wednesday night			0
speaking to the @entity4 in @entity5 , @entity6 , @entity3 -- whose presidency unfolded during a boom era for the @entity10 economy -- told delegates that @entity4 administrations had a nearly 2 - to - 1 advantage over @entity14 in creating jobs			1
" since 1961 , for 52 years now , the @entity14 have held the @entity16 28 years , the @entity17 24 , " @entity3 said			1
" in those 52 years , our private economy has produced 66 million private - sector jobs			1
so what 's the job score ? @entity14 24 million , @entity17 42			2
" fact check : the not - so - empty factory since @entity3 repeatedly invoked " arithmetic " as the secret to his administration 's success , we thought we 'd check his			0
the facts : @entity3 's math is a bit off , but not substantially			2
according to @entity34 figures examined by @entity0 , he understated the net number of private jobs created under @entity4 administrations and overstated the number of jobs created in @entity14 eras			1
but the ratio is basically correct : a net increase of 44.7 million jobs created during the @entity44 , @entity45 , @entity46 , @entity3 and @entity48 administrations , compared to a 23.3 million figure during the @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 and both @entity54 administrations			2
fact check : would @entity56 bankrupt @entity57 by 2016 ? @entity14 numbers were crimped by recessions that occurred more frequently during their administrations -- in 1969 and 1973 , 1981 , 1990 , 2001 and 2007			1
the only recession to occur during a @entity4 presidency was in early 1980 , during the @entity46 administration , while the 2007 recession lasted nearly six months into the @entity48 administration			0
democrats , meanwhile , were also helped by population growth : a bigger country should produce more jobs , and @entity17 have held office for nearly 12 of the past 20 years			1
conclusion : economists constantly argue over which presidents get the credit or the blame for what happened on their watches , of course			0
but in terms of the numbers @entity3 cited , his claim is remarkably close , and the discrepancy does n't contradict his argument			0
fact check : @entity48 , @entity56 and @entity87 @entity0 's @entity88 , @entity89 and @entity90 contributed to this report .			0

@entity3 says @entity4 administrations produce more private - sector jobs
*federal* statistics show his numbers are a bit off , but not substantially
@entity14 terms were hit more by recessions , while population growth may have helped @entity17
