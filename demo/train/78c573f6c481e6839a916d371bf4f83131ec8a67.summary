-- as " @entity3 " nears its series finale , it 's taking some of its best characters down with it			1
the series ' seventh and final season opened with a major death , and the third episode , sunday 's " @entity10 , " served up another shocker			1
@entity12 's werewolf , @entity11 , who 's been running with the " @entity3 " pack since season three , was unceremoniously killed off with bullets to the chest and the head			1
" @entity11 's character deserved so much more than what he got in this series , " tweeted one fan			1
" i 'm just ... devastated			2
" " how could they do this , " wailed another distraught viewer			2
one fan may even have to rethink sunday night 's tv lineup : " ' @entity11 ' could n't have died in this episode of @entity3 ... he 's the reason why i watch this show			1
" but according to the actor who portrayed the incredibly buff @entity11 , it was time for the wolfy guy to die			1
in several interviews , @entity12 has said that he was n't surprised that his character was killed off , and in fact , he understands why his death was necessary			1
" honestly , i called it as soon as i read the finale last season , " @entity12 told @entity36 with a laugh			1
" there was no way they could keep him around			2
... on a show like this , where you 're looking for vital characters to kill off , you 've got to take out @entity11			2
" besides , the main star of the show is still @entity51 's @entity50 , whose dance card has been filled with one too many supernatural paramours			0
with " @entity3 " having only so many episodes left to tell its tale , @entity12 believes it makes sense to remove @entity11 from @entity50 's romantic circle so she could deal with her vampire issues			1
it may be hard for fans to let him go , but , he argues , @entity50 needs to			0
" @entity65 , you have to get @entity50 with ( @entity67 's ) @entity66 ; that 's the beginning of this whole story , " the actor explained to @entity63			1
" that 's the @entity71 plot of the show			0
the b plot is ( @entity75 's ) @entity74			0
... i 'm not even the c plot			0
... i 'm like indigo on the rainbow if @entity66 is the red			0
@entity11 would be a smart choice for her inevitably , but you ca n't have me wind up with her at the end			0
so , what ? they 're going to have her break up with me ? they 're going to have her break the heart of the best guy she knows ? the guy who would do anything for her ? they ca n't do that because then the audience is going to hate her for breaking his heart			0
that 's why they had to kill him			0
" at the very least , @entity12 seems ok with his exit from the show			0
" i die naked in the woods with nothing but my sock on , " the actor told @entity107			2
" given @entity11 's track record on the show , i was like , ' that 's about right			0

" @entity3 " has killed off another *favorite* character
the actor says the death " had to *happen* "
the @entity120 series is in its seventh and final season
