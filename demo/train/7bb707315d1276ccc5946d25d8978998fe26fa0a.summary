" i thought we needed more transparency , " @entity31 said at a june event , reflecting on her time as secretary of state			0
" i did n't want people to be criminally prosecuted , people who were doing what they were told to do , that there were legal opinions supporting what they were told to do , but i wanted transparency			0
" she added , " and that 's what @entity49 is trying to provide with that 6,000 - page report			2
and i think the @entity23 people deserve to see it			0
