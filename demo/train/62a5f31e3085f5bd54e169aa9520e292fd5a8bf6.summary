-- a camera that can see around a corner ? i know this sounds like something in a sci - fi movie or a superhero comic , but this is a real - world technology we 've made possible with a camera that is aware of the travel time of light , an imaging technique that can create movies of light in motion with an effective rate approaching a trillion frames per second : the speed of light			1
before i joined the @entity21 faculty in 2008 , i had done deep research in " computational photography , " a field of new imaging techniques dramatically improving the capture and synthesis of photos			2
but , i knew there was more to photography than just depicting what the eye can see			2
i wanted to create a camera that could see beyond the line of sight			2
the speed of light is n't infinite : light travels about a foot per billionth of a second			2
if i could build a camera fast enough to analyze light at high speeds in room - sized environments , i knew we could then create cameras to solve major problems in scientific and consumer imaging , and enable completely new functionality			1
i spoke to top researchers in ultrafast lasers and photonics to understand what was currently possible			0
when i did , most of them asked some version of : " why ? why spend years building a camera to look around corners when no commercial application is screaming for it and no funding agency has a call for it ? " in addition , it 's rare to shoot light pulses and analyze at such high speeds in large environments			1
ultra-fast imaging experiments are usually limited to centimeter - or smaller - size samples			0
i continued the work and in the spring of 2008 , with @entity71 from @entity72 , wrote a proposal that laid out the mathematical foundation and various experimental solutions for exploration			0
@entity77 : @entity78 ' levitates ' a superconductor i also began working with @entity81 graduate student @entity80 to build a prototype , hoping that we would have something to demonstrate within a few months			1
the grant proposal was rejected for administrative reasons ( i made a paperwork error ! ) , which meant we had to wait nearly a year to apply again			0
but those two years did n't yield any meaningful results , as our lab components were n't designed to be used the way we wanted			2
after nearly three years of experimental work , the team -- especially postdoctoral associate @entity93 and @entity21 professor @entity94 , many students , and several collaborators -- cobbled together pieces of the puzzle and built a software program to create a first demonstration of looking around corners			1
very soon afterward , we could also start creating surreal movies of light in motion			1
we call this new imaging technology femto photography because we capture a segment of the image with a flashlight ( in this case , a laser pulse ) on for a few millionths of a billionth of a second ( or a few femtoseconds ) and an exposure time approaching a trillionth of a second			1
just how fast is femto photography ? think of it this way : if we took one - thousandth of a second of footage from the femto camera video output and slowed it down to the speed of 30 seconds per frame -- the approximate speed of a standard tv broadcast -- it would take us a lifetime to watch			1
photographers know that at very short exposures and even at the most sensitive setting for dark scenes , we will record barely any light			2
so what about in a trillionth of a second ? we actually record and average millions of photos to get enough light , each photo made to look the same via carefully timed synchronization with the light pulse			2
so even if our exposure time is indeed nearly a trillionth of a second , to get sufficient light we must take an average			0
thus , as of now , we can only record repeatable events , but this is not a fundamental limitation			0
@entity77 : a robot that flies like a bird unlike conventional cameras , our femto camera captures an image as one thin slice at a time of one - dimensional space using a " streak tube , " a laboratory instrument that is commonly used by chemists to study light passing through chemical samples			1
we then take hundreds of these narrow videos ( each shot at a slightly different angle ) and create a carefully synchronized , slow - motion composite of the light pulses			1
it takes about an hour to collect and aggregate the data ( view a demonstration of a light pulse as it travels through an ordinary @entity172 bottle )			0
to see around the corner , we use femto photography to analyze scattered light			1
we bounce light off of visible parts into hidden parts and then measure the time and direction of returned light			0
usually the scattering of energy is considered a nuisance -- whether driving in fog or poor reception from a cell phone tower -- and most techniques either try to avoid it ( by turning on fog lights ) or reduce the impact of scattering ( by selecting energy for the phone only from direct paths )			0
in contrast , we exploit the scattering			0
for the camera , a laser pulse is fired at a wall , and the impact of hitting the wall causes the particles of light to scatter			1
some of the scattering particles return to the camera at different times			0
this is repeated about 60 times per image as the camera measures how long it takes for the light to travel back and where the particles land			1
an algorithm then crunches the data to reconstruct the hidden image			0
this technique even allows us to see a three - dimensional object such as a mock - up of running person			0
@entity77 : test for @entity221 's with a phone call as exciting as this work is , do n't look for this technology to be in practice tomorrow -- we 're still years away from bringing this to market			1
but , we can already imagine multiple ways that it could have a significant , positive impact on our everyday lives			0
by allowing us to " see " around a corner , for example , this technology added to our cars could let us know if there 's another vehicle approaching around a blind curve			1
it also could give us a new way to look deep inside our bodies without x-rays , or to look through a window into a burning building from a distance to see if anyone is left inside -- without risking a firefighter 's life			0
when i gave a @entity251 talk on femto photography in june , i began with a reference to @entity254 , a very popular @entity21 professor of electrical engineering who , in 1964 , wowed the world with an image of a bullet in midair , having just passed through an apple			1
he accomplished this by using a strobe light to freeze the action of the bullet at a millionth of a second			0
what we 're talking about here -- the speed of light -- is a million times faster , and is opening the door to a complete rethinking of what we mean by , and can do with , photography			2
it is a first step toward a new world of imaging that far exceeds human ability , resynthesizing data and depicting it in ways that are within human comprehensibility			0

@entity283 's team at the @entity81 is *re-imagining* what photography can do
by creating movies of light in motion at a trillion frames per second , camera can see around corner
@entity283 : technology is years away from applications in the real world
he says it could be *helpful* in *preventing* car crashes and aiding *rescues*
