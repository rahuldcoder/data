-- @entity1 and @entity2 have shared a married life for three and a half years			0
earlier this month they shared symptoms of the flu : aches , nausea , fever			2
she is on a ventilator , fighting for her life			0
@entity2 , 29 , was 20 weeks pregnant when she was admitted to a hospital in @entity16 , @entity17 , on january 11 because she was experiencing shortness of breath , her husband said			1
her condition worsened ; that night she was transferred to the intensive care unit			0
she was put on a ventilator on january 13			0
an emergency flight took her to @entity24 in @entity25 on january 14 where she remains on a ventilator , reported @entity0 affiliate @entity27			0
the couple 's baby did not survive			2
@entity30 spontaneously miscarried on january 16 , her husband said			2
her right lung collapsed over the weekend , @entity31 said			0
he agreed to let doctors at the hospital talk about the case			0
dr. @entity36 , an obstetrician - gynecologist at @entity24 , who is not directly caring for @entity2 but is familiar with her case , said @entity30 remains unconscious			0
" it 's a little too early to tell what her outcome will be at this point , " @entity36 said			2
tuesday , @entity2 underwent surgery to receive a treatment called extracorporeal membrane oxygenation , her husband said			2
@entity46 is a therapy that provides heart - lung bypass support and circulates blood through an artificial lung back to the body			0
@entity31 said one of the doctors told him it was a long shot , but the procedure went well , and she came out stable , he said			2
" she 's being cared for , and her status is still very , very tenuous , " @entity36 said earlier tuesday			2
" if she had had the flu vaccine , she probably would n't be here in this state			1
" @entity31 said he and his wife had researched tips for healthy pregnancies , and they had come across a recommendation to avoid the flu vaccine in the first trimester of pregnancy			1
he said he asked his wife 's @entity69 in @entity17 in october about the matter , and the doctor told them he was wary of giving flu shots during the first trimester			1
" i for one do n't count it as a screw - up on his end or anything like that , " @entity31 said of the doctor who advised delaying the flu shot			1
the couple did not know that this guidance runs counter to federal health recommendations			0
any pregnant woman should get a flu shot to protect against serious complications as soon as the yearly vaccine becomes available in her area , advises the @entity94 @entity93 website flu.gov			1
women can receive the flu shot at any point during their pregnancies , regardless of trimester , according to the @entity100			1
the @entity101 supports the @entity100 recommendation that all women get vaccinated if they will be pregnant during the influenza season : " vaccination early in the season and regardless of gestational age is optimal , " @entity101 says			1
flu season may be heading toward peak no harm has been demonstrated to pregnant women or their babies as a result of the vaccine , the @entity100 said			1
@entity24 used to recommend that women wait until after the first trimester of pregnancy to receive a flu shot , too , @entity36 said			1
but that policy changed four years ago with emerging evidence that the vaccine was safe for all pregnant women			1
the flu vaccine protects against many strains during the season from october to march			2
pregnant women who receive the vaccine may still get the flu , but it would likely be a milder illness than otherwise , and severe consequences would be improbable , @entity36 said			1
a national effort to prevent the 2009 h1n1 pandemic flu has contributed to a dramatic increase in the number of pregnant women who receive flu vaccines , according to the @entity100			1
less than 15 % of pregnant women received a flu shot before 2009 ; in the next two seasons , more than half of pregnant women got the vaccine protection			1
some states hit harder by flu this year the flu may increase the risk of miscarriage , premature birth and low birth weight , the @entity100 said			1
" pregnancy puts extra stress on your heart and lungs			2
pregnancy can also affect your immune system			2
these factors increase the risk of becoming severely ill due to the flu , " according to the @entity100 website			1
life - threatening developments like @entity2 's in flu patients are generally rare but not unheard of , @entity36 said			1
" pregnant women are five times more likely to end up in the @entity160 or have severe complications related to the flu than non-pregnant women who get infected with the flu , " she said			1
the flu vaccine that is safe for pregnant woman is in injectable form , and it does not contain the live virus , @entity36 said			1
the nasal spray versions should not be given to pregnant women			1
if you are pregnant , inform the health care staff administering the vaccine before you receive it			0
washing your hands after using the bathroom , touching public surfaces and other activities is also important , she said			0
pregnant women can also take a drug called @entity178			1
it is most commonly taken to reduce the length of symptoms , but it is also given to people with high - risk flu exposure as a prevention			0
the @entity185 had planned to call the baby @entity186 , @entity27 reported			0
the baby was " too young to be able to be resuscitated , " @entity36 said			0
she was a " far too young , far too tiny , but beautifully structured , almost - baby girl , " @entity31 said			0
his wife was unconscious during the miscarriage			0
" she wanted to know the gender as bad as me , " @entity31 said , " but i do n't know how -- how in the hell -- i 'm going to , when she wakes up , tell her what 's going on			1
" @entity31 's friend set up a @entity195 page to help the family raise money to support @entity2 's care			0
the response is far greater than @entity31 expected			0
he thought the page might generate gas money for hospital visits			0
now , donations are in the thousands of dollars			0
if there is money left over from the campaign after he pays his wife 's medical bills , @entity31 wants to use the extra funds to help his sister 's child , who has a medical condition , and to help support free flu vaccination clinics			2
his public message is : vaccinate yourself against the flu			0
@entity2 had planned to get a flu shot at a clinic on january 13 , the same doctor 's visit as her 20 - week ultrasound , her husband said			1
it would have been the same day that she was placed on the ventilator			0
