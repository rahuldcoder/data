-- @entity6 viewed as a show of force to @entity9 or a sign of reassurance to nervous allies , the recent deployment of @entity3 forces to @entity4 and three @entity5 is steeped in matters strategic and diplomatic to @entity15 foreign policy			1
a contingent of 150 paratroopers arrived in @entity4 on wednesday from their base in @entity19 to conduct joint training exercises with the @entity4 military as the situation in neighboring @entity23 shows no sign of easing			1
an additional deployment of 150 paratroopers to @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30 , respectively , will take place over the coming months			0
with the announcement , the @entity33 administration is effectively sending a message that with all the talk of a " re-balance " in focus to the @entity40 , the exercises also show that the @entity15 commitment to the @entity43 alliance is solid			1
" it 's a very tangible representation of our commitment to our security obligations in @entity50 , and the message is to the people of those countries and to the alliance that we do take it seriously , " @entity45 spokesman rear adm. @entity44 said this week			0
with @entity9 massing an estimated 40,000 to 50,000 troops under the guise of military exercises along its border with @entity23 , anxiety is running high among some of the newer members of @entity43 , themselves former states within the @entity62 , regarding @entity9 's possible designs on territorial expansion			1
under the collective defense clause of the @entity43 charter , an attack on one member constitutes an attack on the entire alliance , thus obligating @entity15 involvement in any response to such an attack			2
the exercises are a manifestation of that obligation			0
" it sends a signal to ( @entity9 president @entity82 ) @entity81 his ambitions ca n't go as far as the @entity43 territory because we have this commitment to them , " @entity79 , a former @entity15 ambassador to @entity43 , said in an interview with @entity0 on wednesday			1
@entity23 is not a member of @entity43			2
while the @entity15 conducts exercises with the four countries on a routine basis , the @entity45 acknowledges the newest exercises are in part a response to the ongoing instability in @entity23			2
" these exercises were conceived and added on to the -- added on to the exercise regimen as a result of what 's going on in @entity23 , " @entity44 said			2
but are the exercises sending the right message to both @entity81 and @entity15 allies in @entity43 ? senior @entity104 members of @entity105 say they are a good first step , but require the necessary follow through by the administration			1
" we should have them in @entity4 , @entity29 , @entity28 and make it clear this is not just a temporary measure , " rep. @entity108 , a @entity104 of @entity109 , told @entity0 in an interview			0
" one criticism i would have of the president is he 's not up until now shown we 're in this for the long haul			0
" " do i think we could do larger @entity43 exercises , @entity15 - led in a place like @entity4 ? i do , " said rep. @entity121 , the @entity104 chairman of the @entity122 , in an interview with @entity0 's @entity124			1
" this is a very good start and a very good sign to let @entity81 know that we wo n't tolerate , the @entity15 wo n't tolerate any incursion into @entity43 states			1
" while the @entity45 will not say how long the new exercises will last , @entity43 is still exploring additional responses and measures the alliance can take with regard to @entity23			2
one former senior @entity15 military officer told @entity0 that such exercises are important to maintaining the @entity43 alliance , but they will require more lift from @entity50 partners in the future			1
" for the @entity43 countries , if they want to be reassured , they need to help with this by putting some real money towards their defense budgets , " gen. @entity147 ( @entity146			0
) , the former @entity149 chairman , told @entity0			0
" they 've been underfunding defense for many , many years for lots of reasons			0
and if they 're really serious about this , they 've got to help			0
it ca n't just be the @entity15 alone			0
