-- @entity2 ' water broke early on december 1 , 2010			1
just 18 weeks pregnant , she called a friend for a ride to @entity6 , the only hospital in @entity7 , @entity8			1
during that visit , and two others the following day , @entity9 was in excruciating pain			1
she was sent home twice -- given pain medication , told to return if her contractions became unbearable -- and was waiting to be discharged for a third time when she started to give birth			2
the baby died less than three hours after it was delivered			0
that 's all according to a lawsuit filed on her behalf by the @entity24 last week , which also said that @entity2 ' fetus had almost no chance of surviving and continuing the pregnancy posed serious risks to her health			1
health care providers at the hospital knew those facts to be true , the suit alleges , but failed to tell @entity9 about the risks and the option of ending her pregnancy because they follow directives from the @entity40 , which do not permit abortion			1
" as a direct result of these religious directives , ms. @entity9 suffered severe , unnecessary , and foreseeable physical and emotional pain and suffering , " reads the lawsuit , which was filed in the @entity43			1
it accuses the @entity40 and others of negligence " for promulgating and implementing directives that cause pregnant women who are suffering from a miscarriage to be denied appropriate medical care , including information about their condition and treatment options			1
" it seeks damages and a declaration that the defendants ' actions were negligent			0
' abortion ... is never permitted ' at the center of the case is what is known as the @entity66 and @entity67 -- a set of guidelines that advises @entity71 health care providers and patients what to do			2
specifically , the lawsuit mentions directives no. 27 and no. 45			2
directive 27 states : " free and informed consent requires that the person or the person 's surrogate receive all reasonable information about the essential nature of the proposed treatment and its benefits ; its risks , side - effects , consequences , and cost ; and any reasonable and morally legitimate alternatives , including no treatment at all			1
" the termination of a pregnancy would not be considered " morally legitimate , " as outlined in directive 45			0
" abortion ( that is , the directly intended termination of pregnancy before viability or the directly intended destruction of a viable fetus ) is never permitted , " that directive reads			0
still , the @entity40 is not standing by doctors , whispering in their ears , telling them what to do , said @entity103 , a law professor at the @entity104 who focuses on bioethics , health law and religious liberty			1
" you would have to show some sort of control , or agency , or direct duty in order to reach up to them			0
... what i read did n't seem to make the linkages that i would have wanted to see , " she said , adding that she thinks the case will be difficult for the @entity24 to argue			2
" creative claims win sometimes			0
it 's just conceptually hard to get my mind around it , " @entity103 said			1
@entity122 , a spokesman for the @entity40 , declined to comment on the @entity8 case			2
a call to @entity6 was not immediately returned monday			0
' it 's about medical care ' means ' lawsuit raises issues similar to a recent case in @entity131			1
there , a woman died after being denied an abortion last year			2
seventeen weeks pregnant , @entity135 , 31 , went into a hospital complaining of back pain			1
the doctors who examined her told her she was having a miscarriage but refused to do an abortion even though she was in extreme pain , her husband said			2
days later , @entity145 died from a blood infection , leading lawmakers to call for an investigation into what role abortion laws may have played in her death			0
" they knew they could n't help the baby			0
why did they not look at the bigger life ? " her husband , @entity154 , told the @entity156			2
according to the @entity8 lawsuit , @entity9 was diagnosed with preterm premature rupture of membranes			1
at the time she gave birth , she had acute chorioamnionitis and acute funisitis , infections she developed after her membranes ruptured			0
when left untreated , both can result in infertility and cause other problems , the lawsuit states			0
it says that @entity9 should have been told about her treatment options , including the termination of her pregnancy			1
she also should have been told about the risks associated with continuing the pregnancy and that even if she decided to go ahead with it , there was virtually no chance the fetus would survive , the lawsuit says			1
had @entity2 known the full extent of her condition , she would have opted to end the pregnancy , according to the lawsuit			0
the @entity24 filed the suit to get relief for @entity2 and to make sure that what happened to her wo n't happen to other women , said @entity192 , national deputy legal director at the @entity24			0
" we care about the right to practice religion , " she said			0
" but this case is n't about religious freedom			0
it 's about medical care			0

the case centers around directives and a woman named @entity9
@entity9 was only 18 weeks pregnant when her water broke
the lawsuit alleges she was not told about treatment options , health risks
" it 's just conceptually hard to get my mind around , " the suit , says a law professor
