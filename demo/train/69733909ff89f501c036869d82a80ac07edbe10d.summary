-- @entity2 's endangered manatees have long suffered from human activity , but this year they face an especially deadly threat hidden in the waters where they swim			1
an algae bloom off southwest @entity2 , called @entity2 red tide , has killed 174 manatees since january , the highest number to die from red tide in a calendar year , state wildlife officials said monday			1
a red tide is a higher than normal concentration of a microscopic algae that appears in the @entity17			1
at high enough concentrations , the algae can turn the water red or brown , hence the name			2
red tides happen almost every year in southwest @entity2 and sometimes last just a few weeks , but this year the red tide has lingered and settled in an area of warm water where the manatees have migrated			1
" it 's kind of filled in an area where they 've congregated and are feeding on sea grass where the toxins settle on , " said @entity26 , a spokesman for the @entity27			0
those toxins can affect the central nervous systems of fish and other vertebrates , causing the animals to die			0
wildlife officials and their partners have this year rescued 12 manatees suffering from the effects of red tide			1
they asked the public to alert them to other ailing manatees who may be showing a lack of coordination and stability in the water , muscle twitches or seizures , and difficulty lifting their heads to breathe			2
unlike other algae blooms , red tides are not caused by pollution , the wildlife service said			2
" red tides occurred in @entity2 long before human settlement , and severe red tides were observed in the mid- 1900s before the state 's coastlines were heavily developed , " the commission said			2
the blooms usually develop 10 to 40 miles offshore , away from man - made nutrient resources , it added			0
red tides were documented in the southern @entity17 as far back as the 1700s and along @entity2 's @entity70 in the 1840s , the commission said			1
" fish kills near @entity73 were even mentioned in the records of @entity76 explorers			0
" manatees are listed under the @entity78			0
conservation efforts have led to an increase in the manatee population , the commission said , and the @entity83 is working on a rule that would reclassify the manatee from endangered to threatened			0
most manatees die from collisions with watercraft or from " cold stress " in chilly waters , @entity26 said .			0

174 manatees have died since january
" @entity2 red tide " is concentrated along southwest @entity2
it is a *recurring* *phenomenon* in the @entity17
