-- @entity3 shooting suspect @entity2 ' dazed demeanor during his first court appearance has given rise to a multitude of theories about his mental state , ranging from full - blown psychosis to little more than being " some freak , " as one victim of the shooting rampage described him after the hearing			1
@entity2 , with bright orange - dyed hair , appeared to stare blankly off into space for much of the proceedings			1
at times , he closed his eyes and his head nodded as if he were falling asleep			0
at others , he opened his eyes wide and looked straight ahead			0
@entity2 is accused of donning head - to - toe protective gear and wielding at least three weapons to kill 12 people and wound 58 in a shooting rampage during an early friday morning screening of the new @entity28 movie at a theater in @entity30 , @entity3			1
authorities say he also rigged a complex and deadly booby trap at his nearby apartment			0
opinion : the overwhelming maleness of mass homicide after the attack , @entity2 identified himself to police as " @entity39 , " @entity28 's archenemy			1
some have speculated the 24 - year - old @entity30 man was heavily medicated during his initial court appearance monday			2
others have suggested he was in the midst of a psychotic breakdown and hearing voices			0
others say he may have just been exhausted , or feigning mental illness to game the judicial system			0
" he has no right to come into court looking like he has a sad face			2
it 's not right , " shooting survivor @entity55 said after the hearing			1
" the look that he has right now is not something that 's going to be believable by anyone			2
" @entity2 may have been medicated , said @entity62 clinical psychologist @entity61			1
but she said an underlying mental health issue seems likely , as well			0
@entity64 : @entity2 ' defense no strangers to big cases some people may think @entity2 was a longtime psychopath who turned to violence to show the world he could make a lasting mark , she said			1
after seeing him in court , though , @entity61 said she believes @entity2 suffered a psychotic breakdown as recently as this spring , triggering his decision to drop out of graduate school , start buying weapons and launch his attack amid paranoid delusions , she said			1
if @entity2 was on medication , that may have made him appear more drowsy , making it more difficult to get a complete picture of his mental state , she said			1
asked monday whether @entity2 was medicated for his court appearance , @entity88 undersheriff @entity87 said he did not know , and could n't reveal that information to the media even if he did			1
dr. @entity92 , a forensic psychiatrist in @entity93 , @entity94 , said he does n't think @entity2 ' behavior was due to medication			1
instead , he said , @entity2 ' blank , emotionless expression fits what happens in a psychotic breakdown that severs a person 's ability to distinguish reality from fantasy			1
" whatever is happening on the outside of him is like a fly buzzing around the room , something you occasionally take note of , " he said			0
the rest of the time , he explained , a person in such a state is inwardly dealing with an invisible roiling chaos , unaware of what 's going on around him			2
@entity117 , vice president of clinical services at @entity118 , a mental health services facility in @entity120 , said it 's not clear from @entity2 ' appearance whether mental illness is a factor			1
opinion : looking into the minds of killers " i think we need to see what comes out with more data before we rush to judgment about whether he has a mental illness or something else that 's different than that , " he said tuesday on @entity0			2
criminal defense lawyer @entity137 also cautioned against rushing to judgment			0
@entity2 could be " bewildered " as a result of his sudden change in circumstances , or he could just be exhausted , she said			2
" i do n't take the bizarre behavior yesterday as confirmation of mental illness , " she said			0
the issue continued to be a topic of discussion tuesday , with commenters on @entity0 and other online venues debating what the unusual appearance meant			0
" he 's a pathological , homicidal sociopath			2
he literally has no feelings for those around him , " said one commenter on @entity0 who went by the screen name @entity155			0
" like his acting job in court ? he knows that spending life in a psych ward with meds will be a lot better than spending hard time on death row in a maximum security prison			0
" @entity64 's dr. @entity167 believes it 's likely that @entity2 is suffering from some sort of mental illness , and probably should have been on medication if he was n't already			1
in many ways , however , he said monday 's court appearance speaks for itself			2
" you can draw your own conclusions , " @entity167 said monday on his show			0
" not a normal guy			0
" remembering the @entity3 shooting victims			0

the shooting suspect 's demeanor in court is *instructive* , **experts** say
@entity2 appeared dazed , emotionless
theories range from medication to a complete break with reality , **experts** say
