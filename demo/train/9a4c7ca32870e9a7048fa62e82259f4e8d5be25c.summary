@entity11 is charged with four counts of murder in the deaths of @entity15 and @entity16 and their two small boys , @entity10 , @entity4 , district attorney @entity9 told reporters at a news conference			1
@entity11 , 57 , was arrested wednesday without incident in @entity22 , @entity4 , detective @entity20 said			2
police say they believe the family died of " blunt force trauma " inside their home north of @entity27 , but they declined to discuss specifics of the deaths or a motive			1
@entity11 , who was a business partner of @entity16 's , appeared in court friday but his arraignment was postponed until wednesday			1
in an earlier interview with @entity35 , @entity11 said he received a phone call from @entity16 the night they disappeared , but did n't answer it because he was busy and tired			1
" there are hundreds of scenarios , " he told @entity35 at the time			0
" i have gone over all of them in my head			0
of course i regret not picking up the phone			0
" friday , @entity16 's brother , @entity43 , choked back tears in thanking investigators for their work on the case			1
" you have no idea what this means , " he said			0
5 questions about the @entity16 case police who searched their home days after the family disappeared found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room , along with the family 's two dogs			1
there were no signs of a struggle			0
despite finding the family 's suv in @entity71 , @entity4 -- where it had been towed from the @entity73 border -- and video surveillance that showed a family matching the description of the @entity77 crossing the border , authorities had no clue what happened to them until the discovery of their bodies on november 11 , 2013			1
a motorcyclist passing through the area found the remains in two shallow graves not far from @entity89 in @entity10 , more than 100 miles from the family 's home north of @entity27			1
authorities identified the remains using dental records			0
at the time , @entity10 sheriff @entity93 said the killings appeared to be " extremely orchestrated " and carried out by more than one person			0
but after reviewing 4,500 pages of investigative records , executing 60 search warrants and conducting 200 interviews , investigators zeroed in on @entity11 , concluding he had acted alone in killing the family in their own home , @entity10 authorities said			2
he declined to say what specifically led them to that conclusion			0
@entity20 did , however , say there was no evidence the family had traveled to @entity73 after their disappearance , calling the border video " unrelated " to the case			2
" we do n't think it 's them , " he said			2
@entity9 said he has not yet decided whether he will seek the death penalty in what he called a " cold and callous murder of an entire family			2
" the disappearance of the @entity77 @entity16 's mother credited investigators for their strength and determination to solve the case			1
