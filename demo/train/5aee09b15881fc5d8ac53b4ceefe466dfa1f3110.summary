@entity0 a traumatic event , such as the 9/11 attacks or the assault on @entity5 in @entity0 two weeks ago , can produce huge shifts in public opinion			1
a surge in patriotism , perhaps higher church attendances -- but one would not expect it to boost the work of an 18th century writer			2
in @entity14 , and especially in @entity0 , the mood over the past two weeks has been subdued , but punctured by public displays of solidarity across faiths			1
in a famously fractious society , there is a sense of cohesion			2
the @entity14 seemed to have coalesced in reaching back into their history and the @entity24 : they have started reading @entity26			1
one of @entity14 's most renowned philosophers , @entity26 published his " @entity28 " in 1763			1
it was an appeal for religious tolerance , within and between faiths			1
the @entity14 publisher @entity33 says sales of the " treatise " have increased significantly since the @entity5 attacks			1
between 2003 and the beginning of this year , @entity33 had sold 120,000 copies of the book -- roughly 10,000 a year			0
from january 12 to 14 , immediately after the rally in @entity0 in support of free speech and tolerance , some 7,000 copies were sold			2
@entity33 said another 20,000 new copies would be made available to cope with demand			0
online orders on @entity48 and @entity49 have also spiked			0
when first published , the " treatise " was a revolutionary creed , and one that landed @entity26 in trouble with the @entity14 government and especially powerful religious interests , such as the @entity55			1
his message has endured to become a cornerstone of the @entity14 republic , where the state and religion are formally and forcefully separated			1
but @entity26 went far beyond the rifts within @entity64 in the " treatise			2
" " i say that we should regard all men as our brothers , " he wrote			0
" what ? the @entity70 my brother ? the chinaman my brother ? the jew ? the @entity74 ? yes , without doubt ; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same @entity80 ? " @entity81 wrote the " treatise " because he was outraged by the execution of a @entity84 man , @entity83 , who was wrongly convicted of murdering his own son to prevent him from converting to @entity86			0
his campaign to clear @entity83 went all the way to @entity90 , who pardoned @entity83 posthumously			0
@entity0 mayor : we 'll sue @entity92 last week , the justice minister here , socialist @entity93 , celebrated @entity26 's legacy when speaking at the memorial for the @entity5 cartoonist @entity97			1
" we can draw anything , including a prophet , because in @entity14 , the @entity14 of @entity26 and irreverence , we have the right to make fun of religions , " she said			1
yes , because a right is democracy and democracy is the realm of the law			0
" that sentiment was shared across the political spectrum			0
writing in @entity114 on tuesday , former prime minister @entity113 said that " faced with the drama that struck it , @entity14 has shown great dignity			1
" @entity113 , from the conservative @entity117 , wrote that , " the people have chosen by instinct loyalty to @entity14			2
" it was fitting , and perhaps not accidental , that when world leaders gathered at the rally last week to commemorate those killed in @entity0 , they began their walk down the @entity126 , toward the @entity127			0
scattered around them , among the many tributes , posters of the writer bordered with the motto : " @entity133			0
" some of the marchers waved copies of " @entity136 " as they walked and left them at impromptu memorials in the @entity139			0
the chateau at @entity143 , once the residence of royalty , devoted the @entity144 to a portrait of @entity26 in honor of the victims of the terror attack			2
underneath , a sign quotes from the " treatise " : " what is tolerance ? it is the prerogative of humanity			2
" opinion : attacks show hypocrisy of @entity159 's outrage the @entity26 , charged with keeping the philosopher 's flame alive , says the attacks in @entity0 were also an attempt to assassinate him			1
in an article in @entity166 , the @entity26 said @entity26 's lifelong struggle was to " crush the infamous " ( a saying with which he often ended his letters ) and defend the victims of fanaticism			1
in the words of the @entity26 's @entity173 : " the border today is not between the religious and the atheist , between the @entity179 and @entity180 , @entity181 and @entity182 , between the @entity177 and non-jewish			1
it is between barbarism and civilization			0
" among the millions of tweets in the wake of the @entity5 killings , not a few cited these words attributed to @entity26 : " i do not agree with what you have to say , but i 'll defend to the death your right to say it			1
" @entity81 never actually said that			0
the phrase was invented by his @entity198 biographer many years later			0
but he did write this , in " @entity136 " : " the fewer dogmas , the fewer disputes ; the fewer disputes , the fewer miseries : if this is not true , then i 'm wrong			0
" two - hundred - fifty years later , the words have new resonance .			0

after @entity5 attacks , @entity14 find comfort in writing from 1763
@entity26 's " @entity28 " is an appeal for religious tolerance , within and between faiths
