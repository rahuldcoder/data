sorry , i ca n't contain my excitement about this one			0
remember the @entity5 video , which became a sensation last summer ? it 's now been viewed online more than 80 million times worldwide , according to the company behind it , @entity11 , a maker of sanitary pads			1
and it 's about to reach even more viewers			0
the powerful video so clearly demonstrated how the phrase " like a girl " gins up negative and weak stereotypes			2
when adolescent girls , older women and boys were asked to demonstrate how to " run like a girl " or " fight like a girl , " their arms flailed as they ran and awkwardly slapped instead of throwing powerful punches			2
contrast that with prepubescent girls , girls 10 and younger , who when asked to do the same thing ran as fast as they could and hit as hard as they could			0
they were girls on fire , and to them , running " like a girl " meant nothing more than running like themselves			0
well , a 60 - second version of this video is about to get its biggest audience by far when it is showcased during the @entity44 on sunday			1
to give you a sense of the possible reach , more than 110 million people around the world watched the game last year			2
meet the @entity52 contestants ! @entity53 , vice president of @entity54 , said the company has been thrilled with the response to the ad -- including over 54 million online views alone for the @entity60 version -- but determined that the most - watched television event of the year could take the message even further			1
" we 've only reached one half of our girls in the @entity66 and ... even fewer boys and men with the message , so i think with such a powerful message like this and the fact that we know it 's already making an impact and changing perceptions , there 's no better platform than the @entity44			1
" @entity53 said the power of the ad is twofold			2
it illuminates the real and serious issue of the drop in self - confidence that girls go through at puberty and how attitudes can shift just by watching the video			1
she cited a study of 1,800 @entity66 between the ages of 16 to 49 , which was conducted by the group @entity92 in december			0
among girls ages 16 to 24 , 76 % no longer said they saw the phrase " like a girl " as an insult after watching the video , she said			2
two out of three men who saw it said they would stop or think twice before using the phrase " like a girl " in a negative way			0
" it 's already making an impact and changing perceptions			2
there 's no better platform than the @entity44 to reach over 100 million people to spread the message and redefine the meaning of ' like a girl , ' " @entity53 added			1
this @entity44 ad will leave you speechless no word on the cost of the 60 - second spot , but it is probably in the millions			1
@entity1 's @entity118 reported that 30 - second spots for sunday night 's game on @entity121 cost $ 4.5 million			1
@entity122 is a critically acclaimed director and photographer whose past works include the film " thin " about eating disorders , the documentary " @entity133 " about the economic collapse in 2008 and the book " @entity132 " on body image			0
she directed the " like a girl " video , which involved interviews with more than 100 people			2
" the fact that ' like a girl ' is playing at the @entity44 is so exciting and important because it puts the message broadly into the mainstream , in front of men as well as women , " said @entity138 , who happens to also be a friend of my husband 's and mine			1
" as we gather to celebrate one of the most important days in sports , ' like a girl ' reminds a giant audience that we need to empower our daughters , sisters , and mothers to be their best , and that means playing ball and living life ' like a girl , ' " said @entity138 , who received a @entity151 nomination for the commercial			0
she says she 's the first solo female director to get a nod in the commercial category			0
" i am very proud that i also broke through a barrier by directing ' like a girl , ' " she added			0
@entity171 off - field woes tainting @entity44 ? after a year in which the @entity171 has faced questions about how it handles domestic violence against women and campus sexual assaults have garnered national headlines , the # @entity5 ad could have an impact beyond the phrase itself , some women say			1
" it is hugely significant that the # @entity5 commercial is being shown during the @entity44			1
the ad turns a negative stereotype of girls on its head during one of the largest sporting events watched by men ( and women ) all over the country , " said @entity184 , filmmaker and founder and chief executive officer of the nonprofit @entity187			1
the @entity187 is paying close attention to what ads are shown during the @entity44			2
it is collaborating with the 3 % conference to host the second annual @entity44 tweetup to monitor the portrayal of women in ads during the game			1
@entity184 said stereotypes do n't just hurt women			0
they hurt boys , girls and men , too , she said			0
" especially after such a destructive year for the @entity171 ( and the women affected by it ) , i hope we get to a place where we are not relying on gender stereotypes to divide us and instead can work together for a healthier culture for all , " she added			0
her newest film , " @entity225 , " about the impact our narrow definition of masculinity is having on boys , men and society , just premiered at the @entity226			0
in addition to unveiling a 60 - second clip of the video during the @entity44 , @entity54 is sending @entity230 , a 15 - year - old quarterback and the only girl on her football team in @entity233 , to the @entity44 as a # @entity5 ambassador			1
the brand is encouraging people to share the video and what they proudly do # @entity5 on social media during the game			1
" we can change the meaning of words			0
that 's what we are taking a stand on , and our message , which we hope will inspire girls , women , boys , is that we can make the everyday ' like a girl ' to mean amazing things , " @entity243 said			0
" i think our girls deserve that			0
" what do you think about the # @entity5 ad being shown during the @entity44 ? share your thoughts with @entity261 on @entity262 or @entity263 on @entity264 .			1

a 60 - second version of the # @entity5 video will air during the @entity44
