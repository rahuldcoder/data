-- for the hotel doorman who greeted me on arrival in @entity7 this week , the rain storms that have hit the @entity3 capital served as a metaphor for a different sort of turbulence			1
" all of this will pass on the 25th " he said , referring to sunday 's presidential election			2
for someone who knows that even restoring some of the basic functions of government is going to be a challenge , the idea that a new president will be able to change the weather was a form of black humor			1
barring a major upset , the task of banishing the storm clouds and restoring normality after the tumultuous events of the last seven months will fall to @entity28 , the veteran insider who won national approval by becoming the only oligarch to support the @entity32 protest movement that overthrew @entity33 earlier this year			1
with opinion poll leads of 30 % or more over his nearest rival , the only real question seems to be whether he can get the majority needed win on the first ballot , something that has n't been achieved since @entity3 became independent in 1991			1
the thing that might just make this possible is the prevailing mood of weariness among voters and the realization that the main beneficiaries of continued uncertainty would be @entity51 and those working to break the country apart			0
most recoil in horror at the thought of a divisive and bruising second round			0
there is even speculation that the runner up might concede for the sake of national unity should @entity28 fall short of a straight win on sunday			1
this is thought likely if second place goes to @entity65 , the former @entity33 ally expected to do well in the south and east			2
very few imagine the other main contender , @entity69 , making a similar sacrifice			0
if and when @entity28 emerges as president , winning the election is going to seem like the easy part compared to an in - tray of daunting and near impossible challenges			1
the first will be to put together a parliamentary majority capable of supporting his reform vision			0
this has become essential with parliament 's powers once again increased under the restored 2004 constitution			0
@entity28 's preference would be to keep @entity85 as prime minister , not least because of the credibility he has established with the @entity89 and @entity90 governments , while broadening the government to include former @entity92 people from the east			1
but , as leader of @entity85 's @entity96 , @entity69 may have other ideas if she calculates that opposition would suit her personal interests better			0
it may take a painful split within the democratic bloc followed by a major realignment and new parliamentary elections in the autumn before @entity28 gets the government he wants			2
another major challenge will be to find a way of reaching out to the east			1
prospects of holding a successful election in the @entity112 region have improved following the intervention of the powerful locally - based oligarch @entity114 , but suspicions of the government in @entity7 and those who brought down @entity33 run deep , even among those with no time for the violence of the @entity121 separatists			0
@entity28 's plans to visit the region in an early gesture of reconciliation will help , as will his willingness compromise on @entity127 language status			1
but the real test will be devising a new constitutional settlement that gives the regions the autonomy they want without increasing the risk of fragmentation			0
proposals are being worked on to balance decentralization with programs designed to promote greater social integration between the regions			0
none of the efforts to promote greater national cohesion will get very far unless @entity28 can find a way to turn around an economy projected to shrink by 5 % this year			2
with tax rises , wages freezes , spending cuts and large hikes in energy prices on the way under the economic reform program agreed with the @entity89 , the new president 's honeymoon period wo n't extend very far into the autumn unless he can convince @entity3 that the foundations of recovery are being built			1
signing the economic provisions of the @entity158 association agreement will be an early priority in order to increase trade and strengthen business confidence			0
but at least some of the important cards are held by @entity127			2
greater flexibility on the gas price and @entity3 's outstanding gas bill would help to ease the country 's weak financial position			1
normalizing the situation in the east is vital to bring back investors frightened off by the threat of civil war			0
that is why coming to some kind of understanding with @entity127 will be another urgent priority for president @entity28			1
his team is confident that with a strong mandate he will be a negotiating partner @entity51 ca n't ignore and that an agreement can be hammered out within two or three months			0
the terms of such a deal remain the most sensitive topic in @entity3 politics , so details are hard to come by			2
but they are likely to cover things like @entity127 access to @entity3 's military - industrial facilities , new gas transit arrangements , the status of @entity192 and perhaps an agreement that @entity3 will remain non-aligned			1
with most @entity3 still opposed to @entity196 membership and the @entity197 unwilling to admit a divided country , pragmatists argue that this would mean nothing more than facing up to reality			2
perhaps the greatest challenge for the new president lies in meeting the expectations for change raised by the @entity32			1
the mood among the protesters certainly seems to have darkened during the course of the election campaign with many dismissing it as a reversion to politics as usual			0
they complain about the return of oligarchic influence and expect the dilution of anti-corruption reforms to trigger a new wave of street protests later in the year			0
to avert popular disillusionment @entity28 needs to change the relationship between private wealth and public power			2
this is what his advisers seem to have in mind when they talk about the " new rules of the game ; " reducing the political influence of oligarchs , insisting that they pay their taxes and ending the culture of favoritism in public procurement			0
whether he can go far enough to satisfy the @entity32 movement , while securing the cooperation of @entity3 's power elite in meeting the other difficult challenges he has to face is the question that will probably define his presidency			1
perhaps changing the weather would be easier after all			0

@entity3 's new president looks likely to be @entity28 , who supported the @entity32 protest movement
he will face a full in - *box* , including reaching out to the east , and coming to an understanding with @entity127
perhaps the biggest challenge , @entity261 writes , will be to rise to the expectations of @entity32
