-- @entity1 is the @entity2 of @entity3			1
having risen in triumph from the brink of death , his tale of almost biblical proportions was given the @entity10 treatment in recently - released blockbuster " @entity12			2
" but the straight - talking triple world champion does not believe in miracles or the sentiment of the silver screen			1
the @entity17 has built his own legacy by defying not only death , but also his family , employers and arch rivals along the way			1
" i go my own way , " the 64 - year - old , whose fightback from life - threatening injuries in 1976 to win two more world titles ranks as one of sport 's greatest comebacks , told @entity0 's @entity24			1
" thank god , i learned in sport , that there is no excuse			0
it 's very simple , if you 're first , second or third there 's no discussion			0
" if something goes wrong , look into yourself first -- what did i do wrong ? " i only see black and white , i have no gray areas and i hate them			0
" i try to analyze , take the decision , even if it 's the wrong one , it 's better than making no decision because if you take no decision you never find out what you have to do			0
" @entity53 racer @entity1 was born into a wealthy @entity17 family four years after the end of @entity56 , but despite growing up with privilege he learned quickly that he would have to make his own way in the world			1
his family disapproved of their teenage son 's racing ambitions			2
when @entity1 found an @entity17 bank to sponsor his debut with the @entity69 team , his grandfather -- who happened to sit on the board of the bank -- scotched the deal			1
" he said , ' no way ! if this is my grandson , you will not sponsor him , ' " @entity1 says			2
" i really got upset with him and said , ' leave me alone , it is my own business			0
' then i started racing my own way			2
" @entity1 bankrolled his own way on to the @entity3 grid , making his debut in the @entity82 for the uncompetitive march team			1
his decision to take out further bank loans to finance his @entity69 career paid off at the end of 1973 when he was signed by @entity88 -- but even this new era with the sport 's most iconic team saw @entity1 continue to do things his way			1
" i remember my first test in @entity95 , " he recalls			0
" i drove the first couple of laps and ( team founder ) @entity88 was there and @entity100 his son to translate			1
" @entity88 said , ' so kid what do you think of this car ? ' " i said the car was s * * t. and @entity100 said , ' you can not say this			1
you can not tell my father that the car is s * * t because he will throw you out			2
tell him it 's no good , it sounds a little better			0
' " he told him and the old man really got upset because i criticized a @entity88			2
" lucky to be alive @entity1 soon earned the respect of " @entity88 , " a proponent of tough love who the @entity17 still describes as " the most charismatic guy i have ever met in my whole life			1
" in 1975 he stormed to five wins to capture his first world title with the @entity122 powerhouse -- but the following season fate cruelly intervened			2
going into the @entity125 @entity124 at the notorious @entity127 circuit , which he had asked his fellow drivers to boycott due to its poor safety setup , @entity1 was leading the 1976 title hunt			1
he came out of the race fighting for his life			0
@entity1 's @entity88 burst into a fireball after a crash on the second lap. he was pulled from the flames with severe burns and lung damage			1
lying in hospital later that night , he was administered the last rites by a priest			0
analysis : does @entity3 lack the characters of the past ? typically for @entity1 , he saw things differently			1
at the age of 27 , he summoned his will of iron to find a way back -- calling it the most courageous decision in his @entity69 career			2
" first , i knew about the danger , " says @entity1 , who wears a baseball cap to hide the scars left by his fiery crash			1
" i went to every accident , even if i was not involved or did n't see it , to understand what happened			0
" the accident did not surprise me because i knew it was dangerous			0
i told myself , ' i was lucky , i 'm still alive so why not as i 'm alive , @entity162 help me , let 's try			0
' " this was the big challenge ... a comeback			0
for me it was clear , that the longer i wait , the more difficult it 's going to be because the more worries you start building up			0
" i had to do it as quick as possible to overcome these problems and to keep racing as before			0
" defining moments just 42 days after his crash in @entity125 , @entity1 was back in the cockpit of a @entity88 and racing to defend his title at the @entity122 @entity124			1
it was a comeback that defied the medics and his rivals , but it was another brave decision that decided the title			0
@entity1 refused to race in the torrential rain in the title - deciding @entity182 @entity124 , a decision that saw the title swing into the hands of his rival @entity187			1
" i would take the same decision today , " @entity1 says			2
" it was stupid to race			0
" the story of those defining points has been turned into " @entity12 , " a movie by @entity69 fan and director @entity195			0
for @entity1 , his self determination has continued to guide him to this day			2
after winning a second title with @entity88 and moving to the @entity200 team , he quit @entity3 with two races still to run in the 1979 season			1
@entity1 said he " tired of driving round in circles , " and a new career as an airline boss beckoned			1
however , a second coming for @entity207 brought his third and final world title in 1984 , before an inevitable second retirement followed			0
@entity1 is now an opinionated but respected voice in the inner circle of @entity69 's paddock , where he patrols as a non-executive chairman of the @entity216 team and a tv analyst			1
if " @entity12 " is the movie of his life then the soundtrack has to be @entity222 's " my way			0
" " i do not want to change , " @entity1 insists			2
" i will continue all the way through to the end of my life in this way			0

@entity3 legend @entity1 defied his wealthy family to pursue a career in racing
the @entity17 *impressed* tough team boss @entity88 despite criticizing his car
after a life - threatening crash in 1976 , @entity1 got back in the car after just 42 days
he would go on to win two more world titles before retiring a second time in 1985
