-- if 2013 was an " annus horribilis " for @entity3 , then next year provides a double chance of redemption for the motorsport giant -- and @entity1 will play a key role			1
by the time @entity8 hosts the country 's first @entity10 race next october , @entity3 bosses will know if the team has been able to bounce back from one of its worst seasons in more than two decades , with major technological changes required due to the sport 's new engine rules for 2014			1
but well before then , the @entity21 manufacturer 's innovations will have been put to the test at the same seaside resort , as @entity1 hosts its first @entity24			2
@entity3 is working with the @entity21 team -- specifically skeleton and bobsleigh -- via its applied technologies operation @entity29 in a bid to help improve @entity32 's medal chances in february			1
" it 's similar work to what we did with the @entity44 , concentrating on sports with a greater chance of medals , " says @entity29 project manager @entity33 , who used to work for the @entity35 team and created the race simulator which drivers such as @entity38 use away from grand prix weekends			1
for a team so synonymous with success -- 182 grand prix victories , eight constructors ' titles and 12 drivers ' championships -- this year has been an undoubtedly unwanted blot on @entity3 's copybook			1
@entity38 and @entity57 -- who has since been replaced by rookie @entity58 -- were ninth and 11th respectively in the drivers ' standings , with the team a lowly fifth in the constructors ' table , more than 450 points behind dominant @entity65			1
but @entity3 has previous success at the @entity44 , with @entity32 winning 30 of its 65 medals at @entity68 in sports with which @entity29 was involved : canoeing , cycling , rowing and sailing			1
half of those were gold			0
it is a model that clearly works -- @entity29 also worked with skeleton racer @entity76 to a lesser degree on her path to @entity80 skeleton success at the last @entity24 in @entity81 -- and there is a sense of excitement of another medal haul at @entity8			1
brought in by the government - funded agency @entity86 , @entity29 will focus on the downhill sledding disciplines			1
" what we 've done for the other sports , it 's more generic in that we 've done a little bit and still do a few programs with @entity86 , and we ran workshops recently with all the coaches for inspiration looking at other sports , " @entity33 told @entity0			2
" in our case , we showed the side of @entity10 , and the equipment and technical side of it			2
" the work done by @entity29 varies from use of its dynamic chassis rig -- also known as the shaker rig -- which is used on the development of @entity35 cars and now skeletons and bobsleds to run the rule over their respective suspensions			2
its technology is used to make both the equipment and the kit worn by @entity21 athletes , but also in data analysis and how the human body reacts to the skeleton and bobs in question			2
however , in order to keep an edge on rival teams , the specifics are kept closely guarded			0
there are also strict rules which restrain @entity29 's area of operations			1
" we do n't have enormous margins for imagination , " @entity33 says			0
" they prescribe the type of steel and where rubber can be used -- and that 's hardly anywhere			2
but like in @entity10 , we are able to use attention to detail to make things as near to perfect and that we assemble things as well as we can			2
" the bobsleighs are being tested in @entity143 to measure the gains that have been made			0
" we can see a tangible time difference that we have made with the bobsleigh , " @entity145 adds			2
" our measurements are by the millisecond			0
" the @entity80 projects are relatively small scale compared to @entity29 's other business strands , which span from pharmaceutical trials to working with the behemoths of oil and gas			1
a solitary @entity29 engineer is working fulltime on each of the skeleton and bobsleigh projects , even testing the equipment themselves on the ice at high speed -- true workplace immersion			1
at @entity8 , @entity29 will be in direct competition with @entity3 's traditional @entity35 foe @entity167 , which has been working with the @entity169 @entity80 team -- in particular with the bobsleigh			1
" there 's definitely a little bit of rivalry with @entity167 in this , " says @entity33			2
" you always want competition , it helps to push you on			0
" for @entity33 , who was brought up in @entity178 , @entity179 , with a love of winter sports , this project is a perfect fit			0
and she sees the love of sport as being a key ingredient to her team 's success			1
" when i interview people for jobs , one of my questions is are they sports fans , " she says			0
" sports fans tend to be inherently competitive and that is good for this working environment			0
it also means if and when you employ them you can bear them in mind for future sporting projects			0
" for all @entity29 's collective brainpower and tech nous , however , she acknowledges that there is only so much they can do for the competitors			1
" it 's all about the athletes , " she points out			0
" if an athlete gets injured , there is nothing the kit will do without the athlete			0
but we hope to support what we believe is very real potential for medals			0
" it 's great working with people that are so driven , especially the coaches who do n't see much of the limelight			2
" @entity86 covers @entity29 's expenses and time costs -- though otherwise the work is done on a non-profit basis -- and has given open access to its data			1
however , not all the athletes are 100 % compliant			0
@entity230 , who runs his own skeleton - making business , is understandably loathe to share details of his intellectual property so he and his partner @entity234 will be without @entity29 's backing in terms of their equipment			1
" that said , @entity230 has still worked with us on other aspects , " adds @entity33			0
in addition , there have been skeptics of what is , on the surface , an alternative approach to the @entity24 , and @entity33 relishes that			0
" the thing is that we do n't have all the solutions , " she says			0
" but by doing this it generally brings in more lateral thinking to the discussions			0
" research from @entity257 has suggested that @entity258 is set for its most successful @entity24 , with a predicted five medals			0
should that be the case , that will be in now small part down to @entity29 , and the world of @entity10 .			1
