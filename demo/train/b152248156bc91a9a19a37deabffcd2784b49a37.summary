-- in a tent on the lawn just in front of the @entity5 , immigration reform advocates are entering their second week without food to protest congressional inaction on legislation that would create a road to citizenship for 11 million aspiring @entity11			1
the core group at the " @entity13 " has gone 13 days surviving only on water — including @entity15 of the @entity16 , @entity17 of the @entity18 and @entity19 with the group @entity20			1
they have pledged to continue their fast until immigration reform is enacted by @entity24 or until doctors tell them their lives are at risk			1
last week , vice president @entity29 and @entity30 , director of the @entity31 in the @entity32 , visited the fasters			0
this week , during a speech in @entity36 about the urgent need for immigration reform , president @entity34 gave a shout - out to those fasting			1
the president said , " we hear you			0
the whole country is with you			0
" which is , of course , partially true			0
the fact is that a strong majority of @entity11 do indeed support the goals of those fasting and want a comprehensive immigration law that includes a road to citizenship			1
according to a recent poll from the nonprofit @entity56 , at least 73 % of @entity53 and 60 % of @entity54 support such a measure			0
not only that , but about three - in - four voters in key @entity54 - represented swing congressional districts also support immigration reform that includes a path to citizenship			1
so who , exactly , is n't with the fasters ? @entity54 leadership in the @entity66			0
if the immigration reform bill already passed by the @entity69 were brought for a vote in the @entity32 , it would likely pass — because 29 @entity32 @entity54 have indicated their support , including many from those swing districts and districts with growing @entity76 communities			1
yet @entity54 speaker of the house @entity77 refuses to give the bill a vote			1
yeah , you read that correctly — a bill that would bring relief to millions of undocumented immigrant families just in time for the holidays , a bill that a strong majority of voters in both parties support , a bill that everyone from community groups to business groups resoundingly supports , a bill that would actually pass both houses of @entity24 and become law despite our historic levels of gridlock — that bill is n't even being brought up for a vote because @entity77 just does n't want to do it			1
such is the sad state of so - called leadership in the @entity54 today			0
if you have n't seen the video in which teen activists confront @entity77 while he 's eating his breakfast at a diner and tell him their stories of how immigrant families are being ripped apart every day in @entity11 , it 's worth a watch			2
@entity77 says he 'll " try to find a way to move a bill forward			2
" but in fact , he has been the one singlehandedly blocking a vote			0
so the brave souls in the tent in front of the @entity5 continue not to eat			0
are they hungry ? sure			0
but , as @entity15 , a son of @entity135 migrant farmworkers , told the @entity136 , " ( @entity137 ) here is a deeper hunger within me , a hunger for an end to a system that creates such misery among those who come here to escape poverty and violence in search of the @entity133			0
" the juxtaposition is powerful			0
at a diner near the @entity5 , you have @entity77 casually dumping salt on his plate of food while seeming completely uninterested in the plight of the two teens who are telling him how their families have been torn apart by @entity11 's broken immigration policies			1
in a tent near the @entity5 , advocates are literally starving themselves to protest @entity77 's callous inaction			2
this @entity153 , may we remember the story of our nation 's founding — not always a simple story for all involved , and certainly not since , but at it essence , a story of people coming to a new land seeking new opportunity			2
and when we sit down to eat our turkey and fixings , may we remember those who are going without food to support the millions of aspiring @entity11 whose families can not be together this holiday season because of our broken laws			2
and may we pray that @entity77 , sitting with his own family and saying grace , can find it in his heart and political calculus to bestow grace on others — and finally let immigration reform have a vote			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity182 .			2
