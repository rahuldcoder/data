-- even as anti-american violence eased saturday around the @entity4 world , tensions remained high -- stoked , in some nations , by the prospect of @entity8 troops arriving to protect @entity8 diplomatic missions			1
the widespread protests connected to an online trailer for an inflammatory @entity13 film privately produced in the @entity8 were relatively thin and calm , and in some places nonexistent , on saturday compared to earlier in the week			1
yet even with this relative break , the furor has not gone away completely , nor has concern over safety and security at @entity8 embassies			2
to that end , @entity8 officials said earlier this week that @entity24 teams would be dispatched to protect @entity8 diplomatic missions in @entity26 , @entity27 and @entity28 in the wake of anti-western unrest in those countries			1
but @entity8 troops have n't necessarily been welcomed			1
@entity32 demands @entity34 nations protect embassies @entity27 's parliament issued a statement early sunday demanding @entity8 @entity24 leave the @entity39 country immediately , calling the presence of any foreign forces -- and @entity8 troops in particular -- " unacceptable			1
" some leading politicians , like @entity44 of the opposition @entity45 , warned that even a few dozen @entity8 troops could " open the doors of hell for @entity27 and give terrorists an excuse			1
" others like @entity52 , president of @entity27 's @entity53 , equated the @entity8 troops arrival to a foreign occupation			1
@entity56 , a political adviser to @entity27 's ruling @entity57 , speculated that the @entity24 recent arrival raises doubts about who was behind this week 's attacks on the @entity8 embassy in @entity63 that left four protesters dead			1
" in the end of the day , the @entity8 is benefiting more than all and was able to bring its forces inside @entity27 , " said @entity56			2
even with the arrival of its troops , the @entity8 government is n't taking chances in @entity27 -- closing its embassy in @entity63 through saturday , september 29 , because of the threat of " potential demonstrations , " according to the @entity75			1
meanwhile , @entity8 @entity24 that were to travel to @entity28 have returned pending further talks with the government there , a @entity8 official said			1
@entity75 spokeswoman @entity79 said saturday that @entity80 has requested " additional security precautions " in @entity28 , whose government " has recommitted itself both publicly and privately to continue to protect our ( diplomatic ) mission			2
" @entity28 's foreign ministry turned down a @entity8 request to send " special forces " to protect its embassy in @entity89 , saying @entity28 security forces would protect " the diplomatic missions ( and ) its guests , " according to a report from the state - run @entity94			1
secretary of state @entity95 has warned the @entity8 will act to protect its diplomatic facilities if countries in question did not prevent violence and seek justice for attacks			2
what the @entity103 protests reveal " reasonable people and responsible leaders ... need to do everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts , " she said friday			2
" and we will ... keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the world			0
" in @entity115 , where violent protests began in earnest last tuesday and continued to rage for days , government officials have recently criticized violence targeting the @entity119 in @entity120 and promised to protect it			1
notably , too , the thousands who participated in these demonstrations represent a fraction of the roughly 11 million people in the @entity115 capital			0
still , statements from the @entity128 -- the @entity129 group that controls parliament and whose former leader of its political party , @entity134 , is now @entity115 's president -- that are in @entity135 differ from those in @entity136 , which tend to be less sympathetic to diplomatic missions and focus more on the inflammatory " @entity140 " video			1
and anti-american sentiments remain high in certain places , as was evident at a protest outside a mosque friday			0
those participating accused the @entity8 of supporting " international terror " and being an " enemy of @entity150 , " with some chanting , " @entity146 , there are a million osamas			0
" " relations between countries of the so - called @entity34 and the @entity155 have not yet taken complete shape , " saying this is especially true with @entity115 , prime minister @entity158 said saturday , according to the state - run @entity160 news agency			1
on the ground saturday night , there was a marked change in @entity120 -- as relatively calm returned to the area around the @entity8 embassy for the first time in nearly a week			1
earlier in the day , @entity115 security forces pushed protesters away from the embassy toward @entity171 , where they were eventually dispersed			2
@entity172 returns to @entity120 that gave workers the chance to finally clean the debris - ridden streets , business owners to assess the damage , and drivers to start moving against -- all under the watchful eye of hundreds of @entity115 riot police , who remained in the area			2
the most heated demonstrations saturday occurred not in the @entity103 , ironically , but in a staunch @entity8 ' ally , @entity187			0
carrying signs that read " @entity146 , @entity146 , we like @entity191 " and " behead all those who insult the prophet , " hundreds gathered on the steps of the @entity8 consulate in @entity196			0
the demonstration turned violent when authorities -- using tear gas and police dogs -- tried to push protesters away from the building			0
they were met with thrown bottles and shoes , the latter act considered a grave insult among @entity208			0
six police officers were injured and eight people were arrested , @entity196 police said			0
seventeen people were treated for effects of pepper spray used by police			0
here 's a breakdown of other developments saturday from around the globe tied to furor over the anti-islam film and related violence : -- @entity158 , @entity115 's prime minister , said saturday that his government has reliable information " a number " of people admitted to getting money to protest outside the @entity8 embassy in @entity120 , while noting other demonstrators were genuine and not paid			1
-- four protesters died and 49 were wounded during an attack friday on the @entity119 in the @entity232 capital of @entity233 , the state - run @entity228 reported saturday , citing @entity235 interim general director @entity234			0
interim @entity232 president @entity236 said late friday on state - run tv that two were dead and more than 20 were injured , but authorities later hinted the death toll could rise			0
-- all nonemergency personnel and relatives of @entity75 personnel at @entity8 missions in @entity89 , @entity28 , and @entity233 , @entity232 , have been ordered to leave and travel warnings have been issued for @entity8 citizens for both those nations , @entity79 from the @entity75 said saturday			1
-- in his weekly address , @entity8 president @entity146 urged @entity8 not to stereotype all those in the @entity4 world			0
" let us never forger that for every angry mob , there are millions who yearn for the freedom and dignity and hope that our flag represents , " he said			0
-- @entity257 investigators probing tuesday 's killings of @entity8 ambassador to @entity26 @entity260 and three other @entity8 in @entity261 put off a visit to @entity26 until conditions are safer			2
agents had hoped to arrive in the @entity267 nation saturday , federal law enforcement officials said			0
-- @entity26 authorities said they are cooperating with @entity8 investigators			0
" things are moving very , very well , " said @entity270 , a spokesman in the prime minister 's office			1
disagreement over how @entity261 attack began -- in @entity115 's northern @entity278 , a large number of security forces backed by tanks on saturday regained control of a base housing an international peacekeeping force that was breached a day earlier by @entity129 militants , state - run @entity274 reported			1
@entity115 security forces , including the military , have been fighting militants in @entity278 since august after 16 border guards died in an attack by @entity129 militants			2
@entity8 intelligence warned @entity119 in @entity115 about @entity290 film -- in @entity292 , the @entity291 claimed responsibility for an attack on a joint @entity8 - @entity296 base in @entity297 that left two troops dead , saying the attack was in response to the film			1
the attack follows a call by the @entity291 on its fighters to take revenge for the film by increasing assaults on @entity309 troops			0
-- in @entity28 's capital , @entity89 , the @entity311 and @entity296 embassies shored up their security after protesters managed to get inside a compound that is shared by both diplomatic missions , according to the foreign ministers of both nations			2
-- the man behind the " @entity140 " video , identified as @entity321 , was willingly interviewed early saturday by a federal probation officer , said @entity323 of the @entity324			0
the questioning came hours after federal officials said they were reviewing @entity321 's probation in connection with a 2010 bank fraud conviction			0
-- the @entity330 said saturday it had released a video appeal to those protesting the movie			0
a message in @entity136 tells viewers in the @entity103 that " ordinary @entity8 and the @entity8 government should not be blamed for the religious hatred expressed in the film , " the group said in a statement			2
filmmaker linked to anti-islam video meets with probation officer @entity0 's @entity344 , @entity345 , @entity346 , @entity347 , @entity348 , @entity349 , @entity350 , @entity351 , @entity352 and journalist @entity353 contributed to this report .			0
