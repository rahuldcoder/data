-- @entity1 has spent decades helping people get back on their feet			1
through a local newspaper column and his nonprofit , @entity4 to help , @entity7 assists about 500 people a year with food , rent , utilities and other necessities			1
he concentrates most of his work in the @entity16 area where he lives			2
@entity0 asked @entity1 for his thoughts on being chosen as one of the top 10 @entity19 of 2011			1
@entity0 : how does it feel to be selected as a top 10 @entity19 ? @entity1 : i 'm ecstatic			1
i want to cry thinking that @entity0 and people recognize the poverty that is out there so we can help even more people			1
i hesitate to talk about myself			2
my heart is about giving , helping , not receiving			2
this is such a great , great honor			2
at the same time , the help i provide is from my desire , my heart , to ease the pain and suffering and fear of the poverty - stricken			2
i find myself in tears			0
for many years , i felt alone making money , giving it away helping the less fortunate , and now i 'm being recognized for doing what i vowed to do			0
i thank @entity37 and @entity0 for telling the world : " yes , something can be done			0
yes , together we can make a difference			0
" @entity0 : what do you hope this recognition will mean to @entity4 to help ? @entity7 : i hope it will bring an awareness of what 's going on in our great country behind closed doors and show how more than 50 million @entity51 are desperately suffering the pains of poverty			1
by showing how we are coming together , networking with people to find solutions for helping them , i pray that other areas around the @entity51 will come together with their local people to make a difference			1
my biggest prayer is that our government will put aside their differences and exercise the simple solutions that do exist for any problem they presently have			0
... the one thing i keep trying to grasp is the fact that the global news media , @entity0 , is recognizing the philanthropy and love all over the world and the solutions we are presenting			0
@entity0 is my hero for taking all of us to the forefront , recognizing that we are making a big difference in the world around us			0
@entity0 : how will you use the $ 50,000 award that you receive for being selected as a top 10 @entity19 ? @entity7 : i 'm going to put that right into the charity ( and ) use that for immediate funding			1
that 's why it 's called @entity4			0
i can never catch up with the requests for help financially			0
and with this recession right now , there are a lot of people in extreme desperate need			1
people who are homeless , we 'll help them get shelter ; people who are hungry , we 're going to feed them ; people who have utilities off , we 're going to turn them on ; people that need transportation , we 'll help fix their cars			1
every penny is going to help our fellow creations in dire need , and i 'm going to do it as expeditiously as i can			0
we 're going to utilize all of our several hundred volunteers to make sure we can end their pain and suffering and show them there are people that care			1
we want to give them hope and show them that we do have a love for all people			2
@entity0 : what do you want people to know most about your work ? @entity7 : everything that i did to help others would not be possible if it was n't for my mother			1
i grew up as a little boy watching her cry through our utilities being off , of us being evicted , of us having little food , and with her pride of not letting people know			2
it 's because of all those tears i saw on and off for many years			0
if it was n't for my dear mother , i would n't be doing this			0
i made a promise to @entity37 at 12 years old			0
i 'm 60 now , and i 'm going to keep that promise for as long as i can breathe			0
