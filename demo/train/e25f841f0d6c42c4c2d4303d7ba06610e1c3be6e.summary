-- former @entity2 president @entity1 should receive an 80 - year sentence for his conviction for aiding and abetting war crimes in neighboring @entity7 's civil war , the chief prosecutor in the international court case recommended thursday			1
" should the trial chamber decide to impose a global sentence , 80 years ' imprisonment would be appropriate , " said a signed statement by @entity11 , chief prosecutor for the @entity12 , according to the court 's press and outreach officer			2
" the recommended sentence is appropriate to reflect the essential role that mr. @entity1 played in crimes of such extreme scope and gravity , " said the prosecutor 's report			1
" it also reflects the critical and unique contributions mr. @entity1 made to the crimes			1
but for @entity1 's criminal conduct , thousands of people would not have had limbs amputated , would not have been raped , would not have been killed			1
further , the recommended sentence provides fair and adequate response to the outrage these crimes caused in victims , their families and relatives , the @entity7 people and the world at large			1
" last week 's landmark ruling by the international tribunal was the first war crimes conviction of a former head of state by an international court since the @entity45 of @entity47 leaders after @entity48 prosecutors , however , failed to prove that @entity1 had direct command over the rebels who committed the atrocities , said justice @entity53 of the @entity12			1
a three - judge panel issued a unanimous decision that @entity1 , 64 , was guilty on all 11 counts of the indictment against him			2
the judges found him guilty of aiding and abetting rebel forces in a campaign of terror that involved murder , rape , sexual slavery , conscripting children younger than 15 and mining diamonds to pay for guns			0
there is no death penalty in international criminal law , and @entity1 would serve out any sentence in a @entity73 prison			1
@entity1 's lawyer , @entity74 , suggested the trial was politically motivated			1
he claimed his client 's conviction was " obtained on tainted and corrupted evidence " based on the testimony of witnesses from @entity7 who were paid to appear in court			2
@entity74 portrayed @entity1 as a legitimate leader who aided rebels in a neighboring nation			1
those rebels , not @entity1 , should be held accountable for their actions , the lawyer contended			2
@entity90 human rights chief @entity89 noted that @entity1 can appeal the verdict , and it could be overturned			2
that said , she called his conviction " immensely significant , " saying it sends out a message that even the most powerful are not above the law			0
" this is undoubtedly a historic moment in the development of international justice , " she said			0
" a former president , who once wielded immense influence in a neighboring country where tens of thousands of people were killed , mutilated , raped , robbed and repeatedly displaced for years on end , has been arrested , tried in a fair and thorough international procedure			2
" @entity1 has been a pivotal figure in @entity2 politics for decades after he overthrew the regime of @entity109 in 1989 , plunging the country into a bloody civil war that left 200,000 dead over the next 14 years			1
after he was forced out of office under international pressure in 2003 , he lived in exile in @entity114 , where border guards arrested him in 2006 as he was attempting to cross into @entity116 amid international pressure			0
that culminated in his trial , which began in 2007 at the special court for @entity7 in @entity121 , @entity122			0
@entity90 officials and the @entity7 government jointly set up the tribunal to try those who played the biggest role in the atrocities			2
the court was moved from @entity7 , where emotions about the civil war still run high			1
prosecutors accused @entity1 of financing and giving orders to @entity135 rebels in @entity7 's civil war that ultimately left 50,000 dead or missing			1
his support for the rebels fueled the bloody war , prosecutors said			0
fighters included teenagers forced to kill , rape and plunder placed under the influence of drugs to provoke violent behavior			0
witnesses testified about grisly violence by the rebels during the conflict , including shooting and disemboweling pregnant women and children			0
sometimes , rebels asked people if they wanted long sleeves or short sleeves			0
the former meant hacking off hands ; the latter , forearms			0
@entity1 becomes the first former head of state since adm. @entity162 , who became president of @entity164 briefly after @entity166 's suicide , to be convicted of war crimes or crimes against humanity by an international tribunal			1
former @entity172 president @entity171 was tried by an international tribunal but died before a judgment was issued			0
the @entity175 has charged @entity176 , the former @entity177 president , with crimes against humanity			0
it also has a warrant out for @entity182 president @entity181 , who , so far , has been able to elude arrest			0
@entity0 's @entity184 contributed to this report .			0

new : thousands would have been *spared* but for @entity1 's role , prosecutor says
the former @entity2 president was convicted last week of war crimes charges
there is no death penalty in the case ; @entity1 would serve time in a @entity73 prison
