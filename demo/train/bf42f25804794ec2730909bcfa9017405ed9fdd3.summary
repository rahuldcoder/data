all @entity2 governments have built in @entity0			1
we 're not going to change that			0
that 's a natural thing			1

in 1967 , @entity2 captured and annexed @entity0 , an action never recognized internationally and long condemned by @entity39 as an obstacle to a two - state solution to the @entity48 - @entity2 conflict			1
on tuesday , @entity2 announced that settlement building in @entity50 would continue , a plan originally announced in 2010			1
back then , the announcement , which coincided with a visit by vice president @entity54 , angered and embarrassed the @entity55			0

there have not been peace talks since			0
@entity3 spokeswoman @entity64 used the strongest words against @entity2 settlements in recent years after tuesday 's announcement to move the settlement plan forward			1
" we are deeply disappointed that @entity2 insists on continuing this pattern of provocative action			2
these repeated announcements and plans of new construction run counter to the cause of peace			2
@entity2 's leaders continually say that they support a path to a two - state solution , yet these actions only put that goal further at risk , " she said tuesday			2

now the property developer needs to make the changes to the plan and set out what he is obligated to do according to the plan			0
" still , 1,500 new units have been approved			0
and a day after @entity64 's statement , an @entity2 planning committee approved more settlement plans			1
the latest approval is for the @entity113 and @entity114 neighborhoods			1
if that plan goes to the building stages , they would be the first new settlements built in @entity0 since 1997			1

" if there is a financial cliff in @entity131 or the @entity55 today , there is a political cliff over a two - state solution ( here ) , and i think we are already slipping down the cliff , because the implementation of the massive settlement program that @entity2 has announced just today and yesterday it is putting an end to the possibility of a two - state solution , " @entity126 , a @entity121 negotiator and minister , told @entity1 on wednesday			2
@entity2 's @entity0 mayor sees things differently			1
a statement about @entity2 's plan to build about 2,600 units in the neighborhoods of @entity113 and @entity114 from the mayor 's office said : " mayor @entity150 strongly condemns any attempt to undermine or derail the development plans , which will benefit the @entity24 and @entity48 residents of @entity0 alike			1
not planning and developing @entity0 neighborhoods ultimately harms all residents and landowners -- arabs and @entity24 alike			1

all these units are in @entity0 and the settlement blocs that will stay a part of @entity2 in a future peace agreement			1
all other announcements regarding construction refer to stages of planning and zoning , a bureaucratic process that takes years to complete			0
in any case , this process necessitates a separate decision by the government before actual construction can begin			0
" the @entity119 and many countries in the world consider @entity2 settlements illegal and an impediment to the peace process			2
@entity14 has been pushing more settlement expansion ever since the @entity39 leadership petitioned the @entity119 for nonmember state status , which it received on november 29 after the majority of @entity119 member nations approved it			0
in essence , the approval created a degree of statehood for @entity39 , though the change is largely symbolic			0
the recent settlement approvals do not mean building will commence quickly , but they may heighten tensions between @entity2 and its @entity200 allies , never mind its @entity39 neighbors who are hoping the international community puts more pressure on @entity2 over the settlement issue			2
" @entity2 does not understand the language of condemnation ; it does not need somebody in a press conference to say we 're opposed			0
@entity2 needs somebody to link its actions to the economic relations with this or that country			0
it was ( former @entity55 secretary of state ) @entity214 who stood to say that if @entity2 continues with the settlement program , we are linking it to loan guarantees that are given to the state of @entity2 , " said @entity126 , the @entity121 negotiator			2
