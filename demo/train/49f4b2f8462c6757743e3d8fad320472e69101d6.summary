he revered friendship ; he loved food , and @entity3 , and gay people , and he adored @entity5			1
when @entity7 died early friday morning in a @entity8 at age 88 , it had been almost a quarter of a century since he had left office			1
but he never faded away			0
he stayed relevant until his last breath , and he had kept the ear of every important @entity13 , from @entity14 to the lowliest city councilman			1
as much as his hero , @entity17 -- and more than any other politician -- he embodied @entity5 in the 20th century			1
eighteen months ago , after he supported a @entity20 in a special election for @entity22 to express his unhappiness over @entity14 's position on @entity3 , the president summoned him to a meeting -- and @entity7 responded by immediately endorsing the president for re-election after they had met			1
i first met @entity7 in 1977 when i was a young political reporter for the @entity30 , and i covered him for two years after he went to @entity31 in 1978			1
a couple of years later , i wrote a negative review of a biography that was critical of him , and that cemented our friendship			2
this led to many meals at @entity41 and at my apartment			0
when he took office , the city was a violent place , teetering on the edge of bankruptcy , and he and @entity5 gov. @entity49 did more than anyone else to revive it			1
" in terms of beating the drums and keeping people awake and having people hope that the city would make it , no one was more important , " @entity52 told me			2
@entity52 is the investment banker who played a crucial role in fashioning the solutions that brought the city back from the brink			1
. @entity7 liked to say , " i 'm just a simple @entity63 boy from the @entity64 , " and he never forgot where he came from			1
as a teenager @entity7 worked as a waiter , and the first time he came to dinner at my apartment , he was shocked when he saw how much i was cutting off the strawberries i was serving him for dessert			1
" you 're wasting a lot ! " he said			0
unlike so many other politicians who never discussed sexual orientation in public , @entity7 had the longest and strongest pro-gay rights record of any public official of his generation , dating all the way back to 1962 , when he first called for the repeal of the @entity5 state law prohibiting sodomy			1
almost his first official action as mayor was to sign an executive order banning discrimination against gay employees of @entity5 , an act that dismayed almost every reporter who was covering him , except me			1
tweeters loved @entity7 's ' @entity5 - iness ' when the @entity95 crisis struck at the beginning of his second term , he reacted much too slowly , and he told me he regretted that for the rest of his life			1
but i never saw any evidence that his failure to act was because he was uncomfortable with homosexuality			0
when @entity105 founded @entity106 and accused @entity7 of killing most of his friends , the mayor wanted to meet with him , but he was dissuaded by his staff from doing so			1
" i wish i had n't listened to my staff , " @entity7 told me many years later			1
although he had never managed anything larger than a congressman 's office when he became mayor , he turned out to be a superb manager			2
at the beginning of his administration , he ignored the recommendation of his search committee and picked @entity119 , a former federal prosecutor , to be his first police commissioner			0
it was an inspired choice , and @entity122 did a brilliant job , but first he had to convince @entity7 he was up to the challenge			2
" we had a great interview , " @entity122 recalled			0
" and he called me that night and said , i really want to give you the job , but you 've never managed anything			0
" @entity122 replied , " @entity130 , you worry about me running the police department			0
you 're going to be running the city of @entity5 and you do n't have a clue of what you 're going to be doing ! " " i never thought of it that way , " @entity7 replied , and then he gave @entity122 the job			1
" we never had a disagreement in six years , " said @entity122			0
" as a human being he was a great boss			0
you have to trust a guy , and you have to let them do their job			0
then you have to back them up when they get into deep water , and @entity130 did all that			0
and whenever i told @entity7 that someone had asked me for a political favor , he said , ' tell them to forget it ! ' " one afternoon , many years after he had left @entity31 and long after i was reporting on him , i received a frantic phone call from a family friend			1
her son had been scheduled to drive her to the airport that morning , and he had n't shown up			0
" i 'm sure he 's in his apartment , but the police wo n't break down his door , " she said			0
i hung up and called @entity7 to explain the situation			2
he immediately called the office of @entity165 , who was then the police commissioner			0
twenty minutes later , the police broke into the apartment of my friend 's son , and discovered he had overdosed on heroine			0
he was in a coma for a week , but then he had a full recovery			0
@entity7 never asked for any thanks			2
most of the time @entity7 was a natural dealing with the press			2
when i was writing a profile of manhattan district attorney @entity177 for the @entity30 , i went to @entity31 to interview @entity7 about him , because they had been close political allies for many years			1
" people say @entity177 is a great friend but a terrible enemy , " i said to the mayor			2
" so am i , " said @entity7			2
" and i 've given you your kicker ! " -- meaning the last sentence of my story			0
and so he had .			0
