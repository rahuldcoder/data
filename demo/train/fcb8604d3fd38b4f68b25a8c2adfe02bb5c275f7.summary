-- many wealthy , successful @entity1 regale us with stories of how they worked their rears off to get to where they are			0
living proof , they say , that hard work can propel you to heights you can not imagine			1
i do n't doubt their stories ; i worked hard too			1
but along with that hard work came something no one seems to acknowledge -- luck			1
understandable , for luck says nothing about your smarts or talent or beauty			1
luck is a happy accident			1
seize it and make it work for you and nine times out of 10 , you 're golden			1
i 'm not saying only luck brings success			1
hard work is necessary too , but it is not sufficient			1
did i work harder or think better than hundreds of thousands of others ? i would love to say yes , but although i tried to outsmart my competitors , i know i would not be sitting at @entity0 without @entity35 on my side			1
" you make your own luck ! " yes , you can , but it was a lot easier for me to " make my own luck " than it was -- is -- for many others bear with me			1
i grew up decidedly middle - class			0
my father was a steelworker , my mother an office manager and occasional bookkeeper			0
neither parent attended college , but they managed to carve out a comfortable life for me , my brothers and sister			2
there was no money to set aside for college , but i knew my parents expected me to be a college graduate			1
because my father , a high school graduate , was able to find a well - paying job			2
back in the day , manufacturing jobs were plentiful , and they paid well , as did many traditional middle - class jobs			0
today , not so much			2
an article in the @entity63 on september 18 , 1987 , reported the average wage for an automaker was $ 13.50 an hour			0
in today 's dollars , that 's $ 28.47			2
( @entity69 inflation over this period averaged 2.8 %			0
) more than two decades later , thanks to the 2008 recession and the erosion of union power , entry - level unionized autoworkers were paid between $ 14 and $ 17 an hour , while veteran workers earned between $ 28 and $ 38 an hour			2
so , i was lucky to be born to parents who could afford to feed me , clothe me , house me and , as an added bonus , expect me to make something of myself			1
also , my mother was not an alcoholic , and my father was not an ex-con			0
we lived in a variety of middle - class neighborhoods -- some middle , some lower -- but there were no drug dealers on the corner , no gunshots in the street			0
there were no metal detectors at the doors or armed security guards patrolling the halls of any of the schools i attended			0
i did work hard to get through college , though			1
i worked two jobs for minimum wage -- one in a cafeteria and another at @entity103 -- to pay my way through school			0
in addition to those jobs , i interned at @entity108 in @entity109 , @entity110 , for free and attended night classes to finish my degree			0
ah , you say -- finally -- proof that if you work hard enough you will escape that minimum - wage job and achieve your goals			1
except luck played a part here too			2
according to the @entity121 , there was little to no growth in college prices in the 1970s			2
college costs actually just started to rise in 1980 , the year i entered @entity125			1
i just missed the massive sticker shock students face today			2
since i went to school , college costs have risen at twice and sometimes three times the @entity130			1
still , i was happy to apply and accept government grants and loans to help pay the bills			0
that internship in @entity109 paid off too			0
i made minimum wage in my first professional job , but i was not a single mother and did not have to care for aging or sick relatives			2
i just had to worry about myself			0
luckily , a news director in @entity142 named @entity143 offered to mentor me and eventually hired me in @entity144 , @entity110			0
four jobs later , i was off and running for @entity0			0
so yes , i worked hard			2
i put in long hours			0
but millions of others have as well			0
luck , by definition , means a chance happening of fortunate events			0
and i would argue that far too few middle - class @entity1 are now experiencing the same " happening of fortunate events " that i did			0
the majority of middle - class people are struggling not because they do n't work as hard as the most successful @entity1 , but because it takes more than sweat to succeed and the odds are tougher in 2014			1
it 's time for our leaders to help people turn their luck around			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			1

@entity163 : those who succeed often *emphasize* the power of their hard work
what is often left out is the role of luck in positioning people to achieve success
she says having *supportive* parents and a good *education* makes a huge *difference*
@entity163 : higher college costs , tough job market make the odds tougher today
