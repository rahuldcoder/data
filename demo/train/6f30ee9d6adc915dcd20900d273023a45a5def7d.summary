-- the possibility of sinking is the last thing you want to think about when booking a carefree vacation at sea			0
yet colorful ads depicting people having the time of their lives on cruise ships are now competing with frightening footage of @entity14 passengers , some still elegantly dressed for dinner , on a desperate quest to escape the ship			1
the vessel struck rocks off the western @entity22 coast friday night and rolled onto its side , leaving at least 11 people dead			0
" this is n't some tugboat off @entity22			0
this is a very modern cruise ship , very similar to ships that are currently in the @entity32 , " said @entity27 , a cruise expert and contributor for @entity30			1
" i do n't think anybody could predict that a modern , beautiful cruise ship only six years old would hit a rock and sink , " she told @entity0 's @entity33			1
so it 's no wonder some travelers may be questioning just how safe cruising is			1
" it sure does frighten me , a longtime cruiser , " wrote @entity41 , editor - in - chief of @entity42 , about how quickly things went wrong on the @entity44			1
" this was a systemic failure that should rock the cruise line to its core			1
" but the cruise industry says there 's very little to worry about , despite the incident			1
about 16 million people took a vacation at sea last year , according to the @entity57 , which represents 26 major cruise lines			1
the group called friday 's incident a terrible tragedy , but asked travelers to keep it in perspective			2
" accidents such as this one are an extremely rare occurrence in the cruise industry , and cruising continues to be one of the safest means of travel among all types of vacationing , " the association said on its website			1
modern cruise ships have sophisticated equipment designed to keep them on course , steer them away from bad weather and keep them steady in rough seas			2
still , accidents and unpredictable acts of nature do happen			2
overheard on @entity0 : worst - case scenario some recent examples include the @entity88 , part of the @entity91 - based @entity90			1
in 2010 , two passengers were killed and 14 were injured when 26 - foot waves crashed into the ship off northeast @entity95			2
in 2007 , the @entity96 , a @entity91 cruise ship that was carrying 1,156 passengers and 391 crew members , sank off the @entity101 island of @entity102 after slamming into a volcanic reef			2
two passengers were reported missing after the incident and were never found			0
to know how to survive an emergency , cruise passengers are required by law to attend a safety briefing within 24 hours of embarkation			2
@entity110 says most passengers on board the @entity14 took part in an evacuation drill			2
during a typical muster drill , the ship sounds the signals that would call people to their lifeboat stations so they know what to do if there is something wrong			0
but passenger @entity123 said the safety briefing was more of a " sales pitch " for shore excursions			0
others , who embarked at @entity128 , about an hour 's train ride from @entity130 , had yet to have the briefing			0
@entity132 , a passenger from @entity133 , @entity134 , said the drill was scheduled for saturday , a day after the disaster			0
@entity132 also said it appeared the crew did n't really know what to do during the emergency			0
the confusion may have been caused in part by communication problems , @entity141 said			1
unlike ships cruising in the @entity32 , @entity110 gets passengers from many countries and thus passengers speak different languages			2
" i can only imagine the chaos of trying to communicate to passengers from , maybe , eight different languages how to get off the ship , " @entity141 said			1
what caused the cruise ship disaster ? the incident underscores the importance of safety drills and paying attention to them , she added			1
" people go on a cruise , and they think they 're in this protected wonderland , and the reality is you always need to have safety in the forefront of your thinking , " @entity141 said			0
" i 've seen passengers go to the life boat drills and the crew do honest efforts to have you learn how to put on your life vest , and meanwhile , people are trying to get drinks and take photos			0
" crew training in emergency response also is key			0
a lot of the training is done by the cruise lines themselves based on international maritime standards , @entity141 said			0
the @entity186 inspects foreign - flagged cruise ships in @entity189 waters twice a year , studying the competency of the crew during fire and abandon - ship drills , said @entity194			1
@entity195 , chief of the @entity186 's @entity196			0
still , no matter how many safety and training protocols are in place , the image of a submerged @entity14 will stay burned in people 's minds when they decide if they 're going to take a cruise , said @entity204 , a psychologist at the @entity205			1
to prevent any decline in bookings , the cruise industry will have to communicate how safe cruising actually is , he added			1
that said , " the vast majority of people who are planning to take a cruise are probably still going to take the cruise			0
and they 're going to be fine , " @entity204 said			0
@entity0 's @entity216 and @entity217 contributed to this report .			0
