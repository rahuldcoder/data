-- shortly after president @entity2 was inaugurated , he said that his re-election effort will be judged largely on the economy			1
the overall unemployment rate is above 8 % ; fewer than 150,000 jobs were created the last month ; student loan debt has hit $ 1 trillion ; consumer personal credit card debt is on the rise ; gas prices look like a yo - yo ; the housing industry continues to be stuck in the mud ; and @entity14 still are unsure what the future holds economically			0
for @entity19 's team , that should look like fertile ground to lay a serious line of attack against the incumbent president , especially in hard hit states like @entity25 , @entity26 , @entity27 , @entity28 , @entity29 and @entity30			1
yet for a band of @entity34 strategists , they somehow think trying to replay a bunch of old sermons by the president 's former pastor , the rev. @entity37 , will result in electoral gold			1
sounds more like fool 's gold			0
when i opened up thursday 's @entity42 and saw a story at the top of the page about a proposal calling on @entity48 billionaire @entity47 to spend upwards of $ 10 million on a vicious attack on @entity2 with @entity37 at the center of it , i frankly laughed			1
in fact , even president @entity53 came to mind and one of the all - time classic debate lines he used on @entity58 : " there you go again			0
" it 's as if the butt - whippin ' the @entity34 got in 2008 was n't enough			1
now they want to try to go to the well a second time			0
@entity64 when sen. @entity65 declared tying @entity2 to @entity37 was off limits in 2008 , @entity34 stalwarts seethed , angry that they could n't portray the then - senator as an acolyte of someone they considered to be a crazed , deranged pastor who hated @entity14			1
the revelations of @entity37 's sermons caused a ruckus in the @entity77 primary in 2008 , dominating the news cycle for weeks			1
the only way @entity2 could quell the raging inferno was to deliver his speech on race in @entity83 , which was hailed by some commentators as momentous			0
ever since then , some in the @entity34 believe that had @entity65 bludgeoned @entity2 with @entity37 , he could have stood a better shot at winning			1
to all of you who love and adore the @entity34 , i 'll play your political priest and absolve you of all of your sins -- said and unsaid -- on this issue			2
making @entity37 a central campaign theme would have done nothing to keep @entity2 from beating @entity65			1
and while republicans like @entity97 and countless mouthpieces on the right swear that @entity2 was n't properly vetted , just deal with the reality that your party lost in 2008			2
trying to dredge up @entity37 in 2012 simply wo n't do it			2
it 's silly , childish , and frankly , shows a sign of desperation			2
and this has nothing to do with riling @entity2 's @entity109 base or ticking off independent voters			0
it just does n't make sense because what it does is remove the core message of @entity19 -- the economy -- and makes it about sermons from 20 years ago			2
@entity2 's weakness in 2012 is n't a sermon by @entity37 called " confusing @entity121 and @entity122 " -- that 's the one he was ripped for saying " goddamn @entity14 " -- it 's the weak economy and him as its chief steward			1
when things are going well a president gets the credit , and when they 're not going so good , he gets the blame			0
and right now , he 's shouldering lots of blame for the economy			0
@entity19 's team was quick to disavow the plan , and even @entity47 had to come out and say that it was one of many proposals that he was presented , and rejected			0
now , @entity47 did n't become a billionaire by making dumb decisions			0
but even allowing this plan to cross his desk is about as dumb as @entity140 continuing to employ the folks that lost the firm more than $ 2 billion in a colossal trading screw up			0
maybe we can just chalk up the @entity2 - @entity37 proposal as an attempt by these @entity34 strategists to pull a fast one on @entity47 and make a quick buck off of an unsuspecting billionaire			1
even that thought has me laughing .			0

@entity34 considered airing sermons by the rev. @entity37 to attack president @entity2
@entity157 says economy seems to be fertile ground for attacks
making @entity37 a campaign issue in 2008 would n't have kept @entity2 from winning , he says
@entity157 : dredging @entity37 up in 2012 is silly , childish , shows desperation
