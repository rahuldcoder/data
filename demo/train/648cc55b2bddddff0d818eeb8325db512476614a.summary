-- @entity2 1 's sole tire suppliers @entity1 -- whose products came in for yet more criticism during sunday 's stop - start @entity7 -- have admitted that some of the testing they conduct on their tires is " inadequate "			1
in 100 minutes of driving in @entity13 this weekend , a total of 82 pit stops were made by the field of 22 drivers -- prompting many involved at the top end of the sport to launch frustrated tirades about how intense tire degradation is ruining f1 racing			1
@entity21 - based @entity1 have revealed they are announcing changes to their range of @entity25 tires on tuesday , which may delight those who point out that many of @entity25 's biggest stars sometimes lap slower than their counterparts in @entity30			1
" winter tests are inadequate and carried out in conditions far from the reality of the season 's races , " @entity1 spokesman @entity31 told @entity0			1
" the cars are much faster this year than last year ( as well )			0
" the admission of the inadequacy of the testing will increase the pressure on @entity1 , who were tasked in 2011 -- when they took on the sole supplier role -- with designing a less durable tire in order to force more pit stops and so create more unpredictable racing			1
@entity49 team boss @entity48 says this policy has gone too far , with the @entity51 deeply critical of what he sees as the debilitating effects of fast - wearing tires after sunday 's fifth race of the season			1
@entity58 's @entity57 won on home soil , with @entity49 's @entity60 and @entity61 finishing fourth and fifth respectively			2
" everyone knows what is happening , " @entity48 told @entity51 reporters			0
" this has nothing to do with racing any more			0
this is a competition in tire management			2
" " real car racing looks different			0
under the given circumstances , we can neither get the best out of our car nor our drivers			0
there is no more real qualifying and fighting for the pole , as everyone is just saving tires for the race			2
" if we would make the best of our car we would have to stop eight or 10 times a race , depending on the track			0
" @entity13 's @entity88 is always tough on tires , but even @entity1 's motorsport director @entity90 felt that the level of pit stops -- with @entity57 changing tires four times -- was too much			1
" strategy was again at the forefront of the @entity98 @entity7 , which as usual was very demanding on the tires because of the unique characteristics of this circuit , " the @entity95 said			1
" this is why we saw high levels of degradation , which should not be seen again to this extent for the rest of the year			2
our aim is to have between two and three stops at every race , so it 's clear that four is too many : in fact , it 's only happened once before , in @entity112 during our first year in the sport			0
" in that @entity114 , @entity49 duo @entity60 and @entity61 finished first and second respectively but the @entity115 , a three - time world champion , concedes that his team 's driving is having a negative effect on the @entity120			0
" the first three cars were a little bit too fast for us and regarding looking after the tires , they did a better job , " said @entity60 , who leads the championship by four points from @entity124 's @entity123 ( who finished second on sunday )			1
" we need to catch up ; we 're not going the pace of the car , we 're going the pace of the tires and obviously we do something to make the tires wear more			0
" tire degradation was the major talking point on sunday , with @entity139 driver @entity138 so bewildered by the number of stops that he radioed his team during the race to ask : " can anybody tell me what is going on ? " @entity138 was the highest - placed @entity95 in the race , finishing seventh , just ahead of compatriot @entity146 --- who shed further light on the effects of the tires in his post-race comments			1
" when we 're going round doing laps three seconds slower than a @entity30 car did in qualifying , and only six seconds quicker than a @entity158 car did in the race , there 's something wrong , " the @entity153 driver said			0
" this is the pinnacle of motor sport			0
we should n't be driving round so slowly to look after the tires			0
" @entity146 added that even the thrill of overtaking has diminished considerably , since drivers know that they are often going past because " the other guy 's tires are destroyed " , while the need to ensure that the tires do not get too hot or cold demand extreme concentration from those at the wheel			2
so drivers may be buoyed by the changes that @entity1 are set to announce on tuesday			2
" we 'll be looking to make some changes , in time for @entity177 , to make sure that we maintain our target and solve any issues rapidly , " said @entity90			0
before the @entity181 @entity7 takes place on june 28 - 30 , there are two more races where the drivers will have to use the existing tires			1
the first takes place on may 26 in @entity187 , where tire degradation is rarely an issue given the narrow streets and slow corners , whereas next month 's @entity192 gp may well throw up similar issues to the pain in @entity98 suffered by most drivers on sunday .			1
