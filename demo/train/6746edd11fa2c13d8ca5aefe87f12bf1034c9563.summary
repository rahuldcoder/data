-- prosecutors in @entity2 on monday appealed the 30 - year sentence handed down to a man who ran a notorious torture prison in the @entity7 nation where more than 14,000 people died under the 1970s @entity10 regime			2
some survivors had been angered by the sentence for @entity13 , @entity14 , who was convicted of war crimes on july 26			1
his prison term would have been about 19 years after the court took off 11 years for the time he has already served behind bars			1
" the co-prosecutors are of the view that the judgment gives insufficient weight to the gravity of @entity14 's crimes and his role and his willing participation in those crimes , " they said in a statement			1
" at the same time , the co-prosecutors believe that undue weight is placed on any mitigating circumstances applicable to @entity14			2
" the verdict -- which also convicted @entity14 of crimes against humanity , murder and torture -- sparked strong reactions as word spread outside the courtroom			2
some said it made them lose faith in the @entity47 - backed war crimes tribunal			1
" it 's becoming a sham , " @entity48 , chairwoman of the @entity49 , said after the verdict			0
at least 1.7 million people -- nearly a quarter of @entity2 's population -- died under the 1975 - 1979 @entity10 regime from execution , disease , starvation and overwork , according to the @entity59			0
@entity14 , 67 , was the head of the @entity61			0
few people brought to the prison made it out alive ; only about a dozen were found by the @entity66 , who invaded @entity2 in 1979			0
prosecutors had initially sought a 40 - year sentence			0
the judges ' first gave @entity14 35 years , but took five years off that for the time he was illegally detained before the tribunal was established			1
prosecutors said on monday that the judgment failed " to reflect the full extent of @entity14 's criminal conduct " and he should be " separately convicted of the crimes against humanity of enslavement , imprisonment , torture , rape , extermination , and other inhumane acts			1
these crimes should not have been subsumed into the crimes of persecution and torture			0
" @entity14 's attorney , @entity89 , has not filed an appeal , according to the court 's press office			1
when contacted by @entity0 , he said he could not comment over the telephone			0
the judge , in announcing @entity14 's sentence , said he took into consideration that the defendant had expressed remorse , admitted responsibility and cooperated with the court			1
the judge also took into account the " coercive environment " of the @entity10 , he said @entity14 pleaded guilty , but he said he was only following orders and asked for forgiveness			0
last november , he asked to be freed after spending some 11 years in detention			1
in the last week of the trial , he argued that international law did not apply to him because he was following orders			0
the tribunal began its work in 2007 after a decade of on - and - off negotiations between the @entity47 and @entity2 over the structure and functioning of the court			2
@entity14 's verdict was the court 's first : another four of the ultra-maoist regime 's former leaders are waiting to see if they will stand trial before the @entity47 - backed tribunal for war crimes and crimes against humanity			1
on monday , the co-prosecutors filed a final submission in these cases and asked that the four be indicted and sent for trial , according to a statement from the prosecutors ' office			0
it 's not known when the court will make a decision .			2

the court has shaved off about 11 years from @entity14 's sentence
