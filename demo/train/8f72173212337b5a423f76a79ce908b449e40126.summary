" blog : @entity1 's dream year shows no sign of slowing he was given more time to rest when the men 's and women 's finals were delayed due to rain in the @entity33 , and @entity1 appeared the fresher of the two players as he stormed to his seventh title this year after another gripping battle			2
@entity4 had ensured he will be top seed for his @entity24 defense starting in little over a week by reaching the semis in the @entity41 capital , but it appears to be just a matter of time before @entity1 takes his mantle as the top player in men 's tennis			1
