@entity0 -- @entity3 winners use most of their onstage time thanking the @entity5 , their co-stars , agents , lawyers , family and @entity10			1
some of their best quotes happen backstage with reporters , where there is no orchestra poised to play them off			1
here 's a collection of what you would have heard if you had a backstage press pass			1
best actress @entity21 was asked to explain why she fell on her way to collect her best actress @entity3 for " @entity24			1
" " look at my dress			1
i tried to walk up stairs in this dress			1
i think i just stepped on the fabric and they waxed the stairs ... what went through my mind when i fell down ? a bad word that i ca n't say that starts with ' @entity37 ' " best actor best actor @entity3 winner @entity39 was asked if wearing a beard throughout the filming of " @entity43 " was annoying			1
" what do you mean ' wearing it ' ? do you wear your own hair ? no , it was just a beard			1
it was a little bit scratchy now and then , but no , it was just a beard			1
it was my very own beard			1
" day - @entity39 , the first person to win three best lead actor awards , is known for getting deep into a character			1
but he insists he 's no longer into @entity56			1
" i 'm definitely out of character at this moment			1
if i slip back into it by mistake , you can do an intervention of some kind , @entity65 maneuver or whatever , if i get stuck in character			1
no , i 'm definitely out of character now			1
" best picture hearing first lady @entity69 announce that " @entity72 " won the best picture @entity3 made @entity71 hallucinate			1
" honestly , i was just asking these two guys ( co-producers @entity74 and @entity76 ) outside , was that @entity69 ? the whole thing kind of alarmed me at the time			1
but in retrospect , the fact that it was the first lady was an enormous honor and the fact that she surrounded herself by service men and women was special and i thought appropriate			1
anyway , it was very cool			2
" @entity71 was asked about not being nominated in the best director category for @entity72			2
" naturally i was disappointed , and a lot of people said this is something that 's going to happen			2
but when i look at the directors who were , people who were n't nominated as well , @entity92 and @entity93 , just amazing , @entity94 and @entity95			1
these are all directors who i admire enormously			2
so , it was a very tough year			2
" @entity74 added " you were in good company not to be nominated			2
" best supporting actress winning the best supporting actress @entity3 will not keep @entity101 from considering herself as the underdog			1
" you 're always looking for the next job			2
you always think at the end of one , it does n't matter what 's happened before , no one 's going to hire me again			2
so , i do feel this evening the respect of my peers , and i am going to ride that wave for as long as i can , but i do also have a practical approach to acting , which is got to work , got to work , got to work			2
" @entity101 said she is not impressed with her @entity3 winning " @entity118 " performance			1
" i 'm impressed by the work around me			1
i 'm impressed by my makeup			1
i 'm impressed by my costume			1
i 'm impressed by the haircut and the set and the score and the song , but no , all i can hear is all of the notes that i did n't quite hit			1
but maybe i 'll get over it some day			2
@entity128 was " our rock , " @entity101 said			1
" @entity128 is this magical alien combination of strength and soul and heart and artistry and fun			2
and if you think about it , i mean , not to get serious , but we do live in a world that can tend toward the cynical , and to have someone in a film like this where it 's inherent to the film 's success that you believe in the goodness of the central character , and that someone like @entity128 exists who has that goodness within him , it made the film soar			2
... and we all knew that and , i mean , we are not coal miners			2
it was n't hard work , but , you know , it was challenging			2
and we looked to him every day and to his strength and to his indefatigable spirit			2
he did as many takes as need be , and he was absolutely our rock and our inspiration through everything and to me personally			2
" @entity101 's " @entity118 " role made her a better human			1
" playing @entity169 , having to connect with the darkness of life , and i think maybe more to the point , the unnecessary suffering that human beings can inflict on each other , i would have loved to have gone home and forgotten about that everyday , but you just ca n't because it exists			2
and it exists for millions of men and women throughout the world			0
i think this film changed me because it made me more compassionate and more aware			0
@entity101 got bit choked up explaining what she meant in her acceptance speech when she said " it came true			1
" " i had a dream , and it came true			0
and so , that was all i was saying was that it can and it did			0
" best supporting actor " @entity192 " actor @entity191 was at a loss for words to describe the feeling of winning his second best supporting actor @entity3			0
" i was on a list with greatest actors around , with @entity199 , with @entity200 , with @entity201 with @entity202			0
how do you think someone feels when all of a sudden his name is called in that context ? i ca n't tell you			0
" the @entity95 movie broke box office records for a western , but @entity191 said he pays little attention to how much money a movie makes			1
" i 'm just an actor , i am not an accountant			0
i love this movie , not for being the highest grossing one			0
i love this movie because it 's a fabulous , exciting piece of entertainment with a really deep message			0
so , i 'm glad that it 's popular because this is what the box office reflects			0
but the money , sorry , i do something else			0
" best director @entity225 suggested the @entity3 he won for director " @entity230 " should help him raise the big money needed to make more films heavy in visual effects			1
computer generated visual effects and 3d offer " a very new cinematic language , " but " it 's too expensive , " @entity225 said			0
" once it gets cheaper and easier , more filmmakers are going to dive into that and create something more and more interesting			0
and that language will establish the audience in the future			0
i see there 's a quite brilliant future and i will try it again if i can afford it			0
" best original song best original song @entity3 winner @entity249 talked about being just two awards away from the grand slam of the entertainment industry -- the @entity254			1
only 11 people have won an @entity257 , @entity258 , @entity3 and @entity256			0
" maybe i 'll do like an @entity260 special like @entity261 did ( and win and @entity257			0
) and then a @entity256 , i 'm not so sure			0
that may be one day maybe someone might want me to do a musical			0
... that 's not in my probability for the moment			0
" best original screenplay @entity95 was his usual exuberant self backstage after winning the best original screenplay @entity3 for " @entity192			1
" he declared that he is an " international filmmaker			0
" " the way i look at it is , i 'm not an @entity272 filmmaker			0
i 'm an @entity272 and i 'm a filmmaker			0
but i make movies for the planet earth			1
and i have since the very beginning with ' @entity275			0
' i went all around the planet earth , pretty much , for a whole year promoting it and doing all that , and i 've been doing that ever since			0
and so , to me , @entity272 is just another market			0
i make my movies for @entity281			1
" best actor - reporter actor @entity284 was playing the role of reporter backstage , covering it for @entity288 's radio show			0
his questions left more than a few journalists wondering about his new career choice			0
" are you excited about the possibility of a black pope ? " @entity284 asked @entity191			0
" it would be an exciting thing			0
i am a very adamant non-racist			0
i do n't care whether the pope is black or white or whatever color			0
" the press room moderator eventually shut @entity284 down , refusing to call on him for more questions .			0
