@entity1 's prime minister , @entity0 , has declared that when dealing with would - be " terrorist fighters , " he believes it should be easier to confiscate passports -- to stop people traveling , to prevent those who go abroad to fight from returning to the @entity6 , and to deal decisively with those who are here			1
how exactly the @entity8 will be framed when it is published shortly remains unclear , but current proposals go beyond what is required and risk doing exactly what the @entity12 insists on , which is to act in compliance with international law			0
" dealing decisively with those who are here " sounds good , of course , and there are plenty of terrorism - related offences already on the statute books which can do duty			2
whether more are needed is a matter for debate , but clearly , as the @entity12 affirmed last september in its unanimous resolution on " foreign terrorist fighters , " states must also address the underlying factors , as well implementing rehabilitation and reintegration strategies			0
@entity32 is working on the latter , but has anyone looked to see how they work ? the @entity12 says states are obliged to prevent the movement of terrorists by way of effective border and passport controls , and passports are probably the easiest target			0
@entity6 citizens have no legal right to a passport , which continues to be issued under the @entity46 and therefore within the discretion of the @entity48 ( in practice , the @entity50 acting for the @entity51 )			1
passports can be withdrawn or " canceled " for a number of reasons , including public interest grounds such as suspicion that the holder might be involved in international organized crime or in terrorism			0
the surrender of a passport can also be required as a condition of bail			0
but what the @entity6 government now wants is a statutory power allowing it to seize and retain a canceled passport , so as to reduce the likelihood of it being used anyway			1
in practice , though , it will be difficult to stop people traveling in the absence of evidence of their intentions ; their proposed destination may be a give - away , but what if their aims are not terrorism - related , but humanitarian ? many are keen to assist those injured or at risk because of conflict			1
the @entity12 says there needs to be " credible information " and " reasonable grounds " to believe that an individual is traveling for terrorism - related purposes ; it encourages the use of " evidence - based traveler risk assessment			1
" but there are dangers here , and it rightly insists that authorities do not resort to profiling based on stereotypes which in turn reflect internationally prohibited grounds of discrimination			2
how will the @entity6 apply such standards , and what protection will citizens have against arbitrary restrictions on freedom of movement ? will police officers be entitled to act simply on suspicion ? in debating earlier legislation , the government made it clear that " suspicion " was a " lesser test " than belief , and certainly far short of the standard of proof in criminal matters			1
these issues demand serious thought , if arbitrary power is to be avoided , and discretion confined and structured as the rule of law requires			0
it is in stopping citizens from returning , however , that the government will run into trouble with the law			2
exclusion orders have been used against @entity6 citizens in the recent past , limiting freedom of movement between @entity1 and @entity128 from the 1970s to the 1990s ; but these orders were an internal matter , applied to citizens within the @entity6 , whereas the prime minister 's notion is to exclude citizens from the @entity6			1
the new " temporary exclusion orders , " it is proposed , will include passport cancellation , entry on a " no fly list , " and sanctions against any airline carrying an " excluded " @entity6 citizen to the @entity6			1
such orders may extend for up to two years , though why two years is anyone 's guess , and not apparently evidence - based			2
return following exclusion may be allowed , but could be conditioned on prosecution , restrictions on movement , or immersion in a " de-radicalization programme " -- the dice look loaded with presumptions -- and returning without permission could result in up to five years in jail			0
humanitarian workers thus run the risk of becoming trapped in a war zone , while others -- rightly or wrongly suspected of criminal activity -- may be rendered effectively stateless in some transit state or half - way house , in both cases denied the protection which the state owes to its citizens , and allowing the @entity6 to avoid the responsibility which it owes to other states			1
time and again , the @entity12 has stressed that whatever measures states take to deal with terrorist - related threats must comply with all their obligations under international law			0
specifically , it has said that no state would be obliged to deny entry or require the departure from its territory of its own nationals or permanent residents			0
" @entity187 , " after all , is expressly prohibited by @entity180 9 of the 1948 @entity181 , while @entity182 ( 4 ) of the 1966 @entity183 declares that : " no one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter his own country			1
" @entity0 's statements regarding so - called jihadists are regrettably indiscriminate and premised on assumptions of guilt			0
he has called for a " discretionary power " to exclude citizens from the @entity6 , though this seems to imply an arbitrary competence exercised according to the rule of government , not the legal certainty and procedural protection required by the rule of law , and with no regard either to the rights and interests of other states , or to the necessity for improved international cooperation			1
no state is obliged to accept another 's " temporarily excluded " citizens			0
any state would be fully within its rights to deport such a person to the @entity6 , and the @entity6 is duty - bound to readmit citizens not allowed to remain in other countries			1
moreover , any state whose airline was sanctioned because it carried a @entity6 citizen back to the @entity6 , would be equally entitled to apply counter-measures against the @entity6 , by reason of its unlawful conduct			2
as was the case earlier this year with deprivation of citizenship , the rush to legislation led to inadequate scrutiny by parliament and cursory consideration of the applicable international law			0
the result then -- as it may be again -- was a broadening of executive authority beyond what the rule of law in a representative democratic state requires and demands			0
