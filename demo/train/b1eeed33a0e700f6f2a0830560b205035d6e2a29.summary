-- the list of defendants whose cases could be affected by the alleged drug tampering of a former @entity3 chemist has now grown to over 40,000 , @entity3 gov. @entity2 's administration said tuesday			1
the chemist , @entity9 , 34 , already is facing a total of 27 counts including obstruction of justice , mishandling of drug evidence and lying about holding a master 's degree in chemistry from the @entity18			1
@entity9 worked as a state chemist testing drug evidence submitted by law enforcement agencies from 2003 until march 2012 , when she resigned , according to the @entity3 attorney general 's office			1
the attorney general 's office began a criminal investigation in july 2012 , after @entity25 were tipped off by @entity9 's co-workers who alleged her work might be unreliable			2
the investigation revealed that @entity9 allegedly tampered with evidence by altering substances in vials that were being tested at the state lab , allegedly to cover up the practice of routinely " dry labbing " samples			1
" @entity38 " is a term used for merely visually identifying samples instead of performing the required chemical test			0
authorities arrested @entity9 at her home in @entity41 , @entity3 last september , but she was released on $ 10,000 cash bail with conditions , according to the state attorney general 's office			1
@entity9 has pleaded not guilty to all charges			2
former @entity3 chemist faces even more charges after ordering that the lab where she worked be shut down in august 2012 , while the investigation was ongoing , @entity2 created a special counsel to expedite the identification of individuals whose cases involved evidence potentially mishandled by @entity9			1
initially @entity2 's administration estimated 34,000 defendants possibly had been affected , but that estimation rose to 37,500 after attorney @entity59 joined @entity2 's special counsel in september			2
the increase came as no surprise to @entity2 's administration , because there was always an assumption that more information would lead to more discoveries , said @entity67 , a spokeswoman for the administration			0
since january , approximately 2,500 more names have been identified , bringing the total number of individuals potentially affected to 40,323 , which @entity59 has recorded in a " master list			0
" while some of these added names are in fact new , the majority is not ; rather , most are newly identified co-defendants of cases that were already on the list , @entity67 said			0
2012 : chemist in @entity83 lab scandal handled 50,000 drug samples the " master list " is an inventory of names of each person whose drug samples were associated in some way with testing done by @entity9 at the drug laboratory , and it is the product of a nearly year - long review and an electronic analysis of over three million lab documents , @entity2 's administration said			1
according to @entity101 district attorney 's office spokeswoman @entity99 , 240 defendants whose cases are potentially affected have been released in @entity101 until the investigation surrounding @entity9 's alleged evidence tampering is concluded			1
but the case against @entity9 is complicated by the fact that she faces indictments in seven different @entity3 counties -- @entity101 , @entity108 , @entity109 , @entity110 , @entity111 , @entity112 and @entity113 -- because she had previously testified in various trials in her former official capacity as a chemist			1
@entity117 , assistant district attorney for @entity108 , said it 's not just simply coming up with a list of names of defendants			0
it 's a much more labor - intensive process that each of the seven counties must undergo to determine whether a defendant 's sentence should be put on hold			0
in some cases , for instance , @entity9 was not the primary chemist in a trial and was only agreeing with what another chemist had confirmed , @entity117 said			2
at a news conference tuesday afternoon , @entity59 said he plans to sit down with representatives from the bar associations , district attorneys , prosecutors and chief justices of the various courts to present the material he has gathered			0
@entity59 , however , made it clear several times that it is not -- and was never -- his role to assess these documents , but rather to " get the information into the hands of the appropriate people , prosecutors , defense attorneys , and judges , so that fundamental fairness and justice can be done in the court rooms			0
" @entity9 's attorney , @entity155 , could not be reached for comment tuesday			0
@entity9 's next court date is set for october 11 in @entity158			0

@entity9 was a state chemist in @entity3 for nine years
her work involved drug testing and evidenc handling
she was arrested last year and charged with mishandling drug evidence
authorities now say cases for more than 40,000 defendants could be affected
