-- it says something about the popularity of " @entity4 " that the show 's professional dancers have become almost as famous as the celebrities they 're paired with			1
@entity8 and @entity9 celebrate after winning last season 's " @entity4			1
" take @entity8 , who last season waltzed and tangoed his way to a first - place finish with @entity13 gymnast @entity9 -- his second mirror ball trophy since he joined the hit series in 2007			1
at just 23 , @entity8 is already recognized on the street , he 's in a band with fellow " @entity4 " pro @entity18 , and he 's thinking about branching out into acting			1
for the new season of " @entity4 , " which begins monday , @entity8 is paired with @entity20 , best known for her roles in the television series " @entity23 " and " @entity24			1
" @entity8 spoke to @entity0 about his new celebrity partner , his training routine and whether former " @entity28 " judge @entity27 could find a new home on the show			1
the following is an edited version of that interview			0
@entity0 : what is @entity20 like as a dancer ? @entity8 : she 's doing really well so far			1
i think she 's going to shock a lot of people , and i think they will love her personality			2
she 's really bright and bubbly			1
@entity0 : does she have any dancing experience ? @entity8 : no , she 's never danced before			1
i mean , she took a couple of ballet classes when she was a child , but everyone 's done that			2
she 's never danced like this before , so it 's been a bit of a learning curve for her , but hopefully she 'll smooth it out			2
@entity0 : did you know who she was before you were matched ? @entity8 : oh , yeah			1
i used to watch her shows all the time when i was younger			2
i would watch " @entity24 " and " @entity23 " after school			0
@entity0 : do you get any input in what celebrity you are paired with ? @entity8 : no , we get no choice whatsoever			1
it 's basically [ dependent on ] whether they think our personalities will be compatible and also on height			2
you have to be the right height , because if someone is 6 feet and your partner is 5 feet , it wo n't work out			1
@entity0 : how do you choreograph dances ? do you like to use certain routines over again ? @entity8 : i start fresh every time			1
having a good song is definitely helpful , and when you get a new song , it 's really inspiring and makes you want to move , and that 's the fun of it			2
you always want to keep things fresh , and i always keep challenging myself , like how can i outdo what i did last time ? @entity0 : the facial expressions seem so important in ballroom dancing			0
how do you teach that to your celebrity partners ? @entity8 : that 's something you ca n't teach			1
obviously , you explain what the dance is and how you have to act and what you should be thinking , but you do n't choreograph facial expressions			0
that 's got to come from the heart and the soul , and you just have to feel it			0
@entity0 : if you have a celebrity partner like @entity99 , who was criticized for being wooden on the dance floor , is there anything you can do ? @entity8 : the best thing to do is to make them feel comfortable			1
@entity99 got very shy when the cameras were on , and she would always dance a lot better off camera			0
but sometimes , dancing just is n't for certain people			0
@entity99 and i had a great time together and still are good friends to this day			1
but dancing was n't her thing , she just did n't take to it			0
@entity0 : do you keep in touch with your former partners ? @entity8 : yes , i talk to @entity9 [ @entity120 ] and @entity121 all the time ; i talked to @entity99 about an hour ago			1
@entity121 was amazing to work with -- great temperament , really eager to learn , she was like a machine			0
we talk all the time , we hang out when we can , she 's a lot of fun			2
@entity9 was just a joy to work with , from start to finish			0
we had a lot of fun , we laughed a lot			0
@entity0 : a lot of people were surprised that actor @entity139 did n't win last season			2
what 's your take on that ? @entity8 : i definitely feel that @entity9 was the better dancer			1
@entity139 was a great performer , but technically -- if you were looking at technique and you 're looking at dancing -- @entity9 was the stronger dancer			2
her routines were a lot harder , her technique was a lot stronger ... especially in the last four weeks			0
i definitely feel like it was a fair result			0
@entity0 : your father , @entity153 , who is also a professional dancer , made quite a splash when he was paired with 80 - something @entity156 on " @entity4 " last year			1
is he coming back to the show anytime soon ? @entity8 : i hope so			1
it was a lot of fun having him around , and i thought he was amazing , of course			0
they were a great team , absolutely hilarious			0
i 'm sure if they ask him back , which i 'm hoping they do , that he would definitely come back			0
@entity0 : there were some suggestions that @entity27 might join the show as a judge			1
what do you think about that ? @entity8 : i think that @entity27 would be great as a contestant			1
if she wanted to be on our show , she should come on to compete and be partnered with one of us			0
as far as the judges , i love our judges			0
i think our judges are great , and i think we 've got a great system , and i do n't think there would be any need for an extra judge			1
i love @entity27 -- i 've met her several times because " @entity28 " is right next door to us			2
i would love for her to come on the show and be my partner			0
@entity0 : are you recognized on the street ? @entity8 : i have loads of people come up to me			2
they ask questions about the season			0
it 's really nice , and i really appreciate it			0
@entity0 : your fellow pros on " @entity4 , " @entity194 and @entity195 , broke off their engagement recently			1
is that going to affect the show in any way ? @entity8 : we 're all very professional			1
it will definitely not affect the show , we 'll keep on dancing			2
you wo n't even be able to tell			1
i 've talked to @entity209 several times			0
these things are never easy , and @entity209 is a dear , dear friend of mine			0
i 've known him for 13 years			0
@entity0 : what are your career goals beyond dancing ? @entity8 : i 'm actually a guitar player and a singer / songwriter			2
i studied musical theater and music and vocals			0
anything to do with music is definitely a big goal of mine			0
i 've studied acting for 10 years , so i 'd love to do film at some point as well .			0
