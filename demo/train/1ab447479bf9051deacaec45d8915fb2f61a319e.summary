-- a @entity2 farmer in @entity3 has surpassed a month on a hunger strike , demanding the release of six men from his community jailed since the 1990s during a period of a deadly @entity2 separatist movement in the country			1
@entity12 , 48 , began his protest on november 14 , his aide , @entity11 , told @entity0			1
his hunger strike brings attention to the fates of @entity2 who were arrested and convicted for their actions during the separatist movement , but who , unlike others , have not had their sentences shortened			1
the fact that other @entity3 sentenced to life have been released earlier , but not the @entity2 , has some accusing the justice system of discrimination against the group			1
those who support @entity28 's hunger strike say it is long overdue that the cases of those @entity2 be reviewed			1
an armed @entity2 rebellion operated in @entity32 , the heartland of the faith , from the 1980s to the early 1990s , when it was crushed			1
hiding from the massacre : 1984 remembered many political leaders were assassinated during the insurgency			2
@entity3 's then - prime minister @entity39 was killed by her @entity2 bodyguards in october 1984 , the same year she had ordered a military raid on the @entity42 , the holiest of the @entity2 shrines , to flush out militants holed up inside			1
three of the six convicts whose freedom @entity28 is fighting for were arrested in 1995 for their alleged role in the assassination of @entity32 's then - chief minister , @entity50 , in a car bombing			2
they were sentenced to life in prison			2
the others were convicted under a draconian anti-terror law that has since been repealed , civil rights lawyer @entity54 said			0
" it is not unusual to set lifers free after they have served 14 years in prison , " @entity54 said			0
" these prisoners should also be freed , as normalcy returned to @entity32 long ago and they should be joining the mainstream now			0
" international rights groups have accused both the @entity2 separatists and @entity3 forces of serious violations during the insurgency			1
the six @entity2 inmates are lodged in the jails of the federally - administered territory of @entity71 and in @entity32 , @entity72 and @entity73 states			1
@entity28 is " weak but says he will not end ( his hunger strike ) until he sees those six prisoners free , " his aide said			1
@entity79 : ' free those political prisoners [ who ] should be legally free ' @entity28 's protest , which has drawn support from across the @entity2 political and religious spectrum , has gained a viral online attention , although the story is not prominent on @entity3 's national media			1
" a number of @entity2 were falsely arrested , charged and convicted			1
many of them are still in jails despite their old age			0
it 's my personal opinion all such prisoners â € ” whichever community they may belong to â € ” should be set free now , " said @entity92 , general secretary of the @entity93 ( @entity93 ) , the top @entity2 religious administration in @entity32			1
" it 's up to the discretion of those governments , administrations to reconsider their cases			0
we are trying our best , " @entity32 government spokesman @entity105 said			0
in @entity3 , state authorities can review a lifer 's case after a prisoner serving that sentence has spent 14 years , @entity105 and lawyer @entity54 said			0
" but , otherwise , a life sentence means sentence until the last breath of the prisoner , " @entity105 said			0
rights attorneys , however , say authorities are selectively rejecting reviews of @entity2 inmates incarcerated during the @entity32 militancy			1
" there are numerous examples where life convicts have been prematurely released after undergoing imprisonment of 12 to 14 years or even less , " @entity54 said			0
" it is a great discrimination against ... because of their religious beliefs			0
" meantime , @entity130 , in a statement to @entity0 , called upon @entity3 authorities not to let prisoners remain behind the bars beyond their sentences			0
" there were serious human rights abuses during the @entity32 insurgency , " the human rights group said			2
both militants , with their attacks , and the security forces , abusing the now repealed terror law , committed human rights violations , the group said			1
sikhs and rights bodies have also accused successive @entity3 governments of going soft on high - profile politicians suspected of perpetrating a massacre of @entity2 in and round @entity150 in the wake of @entity153 's assassination			2
official figures put the number of those killed in the 1984 @entity158 attacks at 2,733 in the @entity3 capital alone			0
human rights activists say the death toll was much higher			0
" despite the findings of independent commissions , government forces or officials responsible for excesses , including during the 1984 riots , are yet to be properly prosecuted , " @entity130 said in its statement			0
himself a @entity2 and the country 's first non-hindu head of government , @entity3 prime minister @entity171 issued a public apology for the deadly events -- 21 years after their occurrence			2
" i have no hesitation in apologizing not only to the @entity2 community but the whole @entity3 nation because what took place in 1984 is the negation of the concept of nationhood and what enshrined in our @entity185			2
so , i am not standing on any false prestige			0
on behalf of our government , on behalf of the entire people of this country , i bow my head in shame that such thing took place , " @entity50 told @entity3 's @entity188 in an impassioned address in 2005 .			0

@entity12 has been on a hunger strike for more than a month
he is demanding the freedom of a group of @entity2 separatists
both sides in the conflict during the 1980s and 1990s committed violations
but some argue that the justice system has been *harsher* on the @entity2
