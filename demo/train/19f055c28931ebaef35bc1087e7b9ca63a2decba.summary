-- do n't count @entity1 out of the @entity3 mayoral race just yet			1
he 's still a contender			0
that 's @entity6 , for anyone who slept through the news that more x-rated photos and text messages apparently sent ( under that nom de plume ) by @entity6 to a then - 22 - year - old woman have surfaced			1
the raunchy messages were reportedly sent via the social media website @entity15 in august 2012 , nearly a year after @entity6 resigned from @entity16 after his first sex scandal			1
but this time around , @entity6 is smarter			1
instead of denials , @entity6 has admitted communicating with the young woman and asked for forgiveness , again			2
" i want to bring my vision to the people of the city of @entity3			0
i hope they are willing to still continue to give me a second chance , " @entity6 said in his news conference tuesday with his wife , @entity25 , a longtime @entity26 adviser , standing by his side			2
i say @entity6 should stay in the race and let the voters decide his fate			1
opinion : the public humiliation of @entity25 and it looks like he 's planning to do just that			0
he 's resisting all calls to step down and has promised , once again , to stop sexting			2
just 10 days ago , polls showed him narrowly leading the race for the @entity44 nomination over city council speaker @entity45 , according to @entity46			0
everyone loves to chime in on a scandal			0
and while numerous people and publications , including the @entity53 editorial board , profess outrage over latest @entity6 's moral lapses -- and others are labeling him a sexual predator and demanding that he drop out -- it may be time for @entity58 to fess up			1
@entity6 may be in the headlines today , but many @entity58 adults are using social networking to spice up their sex lives			1
@entity6 's messages are raunchy			1
they read more like an erotica novel by the hugely successful author @entity66			0
and one of the reasons voters may just grant @entity6 the forgiveness he 's asking for is because many of us can relate			1
sexting between adults , both married and single , is on the rise			0
nearly one in five adults in the @entity58 says they use their smartphone for sexting , sharing explicit photos or text messages with others , says @entity80 , which sponsored the @entity82 poll of 2,097 adults			2
the biggest age groups for sexting are 18 - to 34 - year - old men ( 32 % ) and 35 - to 44 - year - old women ( 25 % )			0
even baby boomers are getting into the action , with one in 10 people age 55 and older sexting			0
all those parents who are admonishing their children about the dangers of sexting ? well , they speak from experience : the @entity82 survey found that 30 % of parents with children under the age of 18 have also sexted			0
like it or not , we have become a sexting nation , which may explain why some voters are willing to forgive politicians caught up in sex scandals and give them a second and even a third chance			2
if @entity108 , who resigned as @entity3 governor in 2008 after a scandal involving prostitutes , can rehab his political career enough to compete for @entity3 comptroller in this election , then it stands to reason that @entity6 , with all his faults , still has the right to have voters decide whether he 's fit enough to become the city 's next mayor			1
" @entity3 have a forgiving attitude			0
if this was in another state , @entity6 might not make it , but here , he has a chance , " said @entity121 , an educator in @entity3			2
for @entity121 , who says @entity6 wo n't get his vote , it 's all about his politics			1
" i probably wo n't vote for him -- or @entity108 , either			1
@entity6 wants to cut 1,400 parent coordinator positions from the @entity130			2
that 's a disgrace , " @entity121 said			0
like many voters , @entity121 is concerned that the @entity6 story will take away from the critical issues facing voters in the coming election			1
opinion : hey @entity6 , @entity3 does n't like to look stupid " i 'm almost betting that another allegation will come up			1
this is a very important election			0
the new mayor will likely reform the @entity130 and other important city agencies			0
we need to focus on those issues , not his sex life			0
" whether it 's @entity6 , @entity108 or one of the city 's favorite sons , former mayor @entity149 , the political sex scandal has become a familiar story at every level of @entity58 politics			1
and after the headlines fade , it almost seems a non-issue at the polls			0
voters today are more likely to forgive and even re-elect the candidate unless the scandal involved gross corruption or misuse of public funds , such as when @entity165 mayor @entity164 was forced to leave office			1
maybe the time has come to accept that @entity58 politicians are flawed , but that does n't necessarily exclude them from a productive political career			1
these stories will not go away , not with the incredible access technology gives us into personal lives of our neighbors around the globe			0
" @entity58 attitudes are changing about sex because of evolving sexual norms and modernization , " said @entity177 , associate professor of political science at @entity179			2
" we are a forgiving nation and will forgive the sinner if he is truly apologetic			0
if a politician can make the case that sexual impropriety is a personal matter , the public will likely give him a pass			0
" " but the timing is a problem for @entity6 , " said @entity177 , also the editor of " @entity193 in @entity194 : a @entity197			2
" " how many times is he going to apologize to the public ? " opinion : why @entity6 's problem is ours , too we do n't know what type of relationship @entity6 has with his wife , but @entity25 is standing by her husband for now			1
@entity3 voters will also have an important choice about @entity6 and @entity108 and whether we hold our politicians to a higher moral responsibility than we hold ourselves			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			0

@entity216 : do n't count out " @entity1 " yet ; @entity6 should still run for mayor
calls for him to quit may not take into account @entity58 ' growing tendency to " sext , " she says
she says if @entity108 can run with his sex scandal , why not @entity6 ? voters should decide
@entity229 : maybe it 's time to accept that flawed people can still govern productively
