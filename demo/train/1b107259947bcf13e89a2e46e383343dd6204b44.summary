when i was growing up in @entity2 , math was an everyday part of life			1
my parents instilled in me a passion for discovery , and they never made a distinction between science and creativity			0
we would play with math problems just as we would play with pens and paper to draw -- math was like sketching			2
in my teens , my family would go to @entity18 each summer , visiting the many art galleries and museums , including the @entity21			2
i am forever grateful to my parents for introducing me to art and science in a way that drew no boundaries between them			2

the headmistress was deeply committed to the education of women and understood that @entity39 subjects must be taught in a way connects their inherent creativity and relationships with the real world , rather than dry data to be memorized and regurgitated on standardized tests			1
there is a definite connection between the logic of math and architecture -- so much of the work we are doing in our office comes from my fascination with mathematical logic and geometry			1
huge advances in design technology are enabling us to rethink form and space , and the wonderfully fluid surfaces and structures of each project are defined by scientific innovations			0
our design for the new @entity66 at @entity18 's @entity21 will convey these seemingly abstract concepts into an inspiring interactive experience for all visitors			2

women have made tremendous contributions -- and we must celebrate their success			0
when teaching at universities , many of my best students are women , but they sometimes lack confidence			0
i believe education at all levels is critical			1
