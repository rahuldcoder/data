-- when my friend @entity2 died , it felt almost like the end of a fireworks show , when the smoke hangs in the air and crowds walk slowly home			1
the fun was over in a flash			0
@entity2 was the life of the party , the girl who urged you to stay for just one more drink , a journalist who could splash life into a good story			1
she was also , as it turned out , an alcoholic whose drinking was so severe it corroded her liver until it just stopped working			2
just a few weeks before her october 26 death from cirrhosis , she looked out the window of her condo in the @entity28 at a stunning view of the crowds whooping it up at @entity32			1
" here i am , just another @entity33 in the @entity28 watching the @entity34			1
every one of those people has a beer in their hand , " she rambled on , noting how @entity33 are big baseball fans			1
" what is it about @entity41 and drinking ? " that was the same day she said : " @entity44 , i do n't think i 'm going to make it			2
" and then she did n't			0
@entity2 , 54 when she died , was a well - educated @entity46 who had devoted her career to reporting on the neglect of poor , ethnic communities			1
now she 'd ended her life like the anecdotal lead to one of her stories -- this one on how @entity55 are dying from alcoholism - related cirrhosis at higher rates than other ethnic or racial groups , and no one seems to know precisely why			1
video : @entity61 : i started drinking at 8 latino men die at 1.7 times the rate of whites and @entity55 at 1.5 times the rate , according to statistics compiled by the @entity69			1
both genders die from alcoholism - related cirrhosis at twice the rate of @entity73			1
only @entity74 suffer mortality rates at higher levels			1
" you probably have a bed here where you put the @entity33 from the @entity28 , " she had yelled sarcastically , irascible during her first visit to a @entity80 emergency room			1
she was n't far off when it comes to cirrhosis			2
@entity33 have a higher rate of alcohol abuse than other @entity55 , says dr. @entity88 , who has studied alcohol abuse in minority groups for the @entity91			1
there are few explanations as to why			0
" yes , it 's binge drinking , and drinking in general , but as to why ( no one knows ) , " @entity88 said			2
some of the problem may begin on the island and get worse as @entity33 move stateside , says @entity98 , who co-authored a 2005 book on alcohol abuse among @entity33			1
" in @entity102 , the tendency is for people to drink in large amounts but less frequently			0
when they drink , they get drunk , " @entity98 said			0
" then they come to the @entity108 , where people drink with more frequency , and @entity55 adopt both habits			1
" @entity98 , who has a doctorate in social work , believes that colonization and migration leave some @entity41 feeling like they are immigrants even though they are born @entity108 citizens			1
they feel beaten down as they face new economic and social challenges without the strong family structures they left behind on the island			0
" all that drives people nuts , " he said bluntly			0
" you are always having to reinvent yourself			0
" he thinks studying why @entity55 , and @entity33 in particular , seem prone to drink will help social workers like him develop better prevention and treatment			1
video : alcoholism , eating disorders may be genetically linked @entity2 knew all about @entity41 fighting off a culture of drinking			1
in the weeks before she was diagnosed , she raged about a dustup between some @entity33 leaders and @entity139			1
the beer company had apologized after some @entity33 felt insulted by a @entity139 can emblazoned with the @entity33 flag in honor of the community 's 2013 annual pride parade			1
the parade theme was " @entity146 : celebrating your health			0
" " the hypocrisy of this ! " she would say , screaming at the tv set , noting the @entity33 organizing the parade supported @entity139			1
" i 'm going to have my students look into it			0
" @entity139 later issued an apology , noted its sponsorship of scholarships for @entity55 and said it was trying to celebrate culture			1
it stopped production of the cans			0
@entity2 had left full - time journalism to teach journalism at @entity165 and was hoping her students would adopt her passion for covering racial and ethnic minorities			2
she noted that in 2011 , @entity41 were divided over another @entity139 ad campaign titled " @entity170			0
" @entity33 is a slang term for @entity33 and " @entity176 " was an obvious play on the @entity174 word " @entity175 , " meaning " get drunk			2
" @entity139 later apologized for offending anyone and dropped the ad , and the partnership between the @entity33 parade and the beer company continued			2
even as she talked about the community 's divisions , though , @entity2 never fully acknowledged she had a drinking problem			1
alcohol abuse is often a disease that can hide in plain sight in @entity46 communities , says @entity189 , who studies minority health disparities for the @entity191			1
latinos sometimes diminish heavy drinking , said @entity189 , believing that people who drink excessively once a month or every six weeks have nothing more significant than " un vicio , " just a vice			2
@entity2 's family did n't see it coming until very late			2
" she 'd have a little traguito , ( drink ) as they say , but i did n't think she was an addict , " said her brother , @entity199			0
@entity2 came from a solid working - class family from @entity203 , a destination for @entity33 searching for manufacturing jobs in years past			1
she called it " the @entity33 @entity207 " -- three boys and three girls , living in a house with one bathroom			2
last @entity213 , her brother said , " she came home looking white like a ghost			0
she did n't eat well at dinner			0
" the family always bought a bottle of liquor for guests , and when her brother woke up the morning after her arrival , it was mysteriously empty			0
the year before , their sister @entity224 had died from cirrhosis			2
@entity199 remembers trying to wrench a bottle of alcohol from @entity224 's hands			2
" i told @entity224 , ' the only way you 'll stop is in the grave , ' and that turned out to be true , " her brother said			0
they recognized the physical signs in @entity2 , but did n't connect it to heavy drinking			1
" we knew @entity224 was an alcoholic			0
she would n't go to rehab			0
it was gradual , but we knew it was her destiny , " said her other sister , @entity240			0
" with @entity2 , we did n't know the severity of her drinking			1
she 'd be up late drinking when she visited , but we thought she was just stressed from work			2
now i ca n't believe this disease has taken two of my sisters			0
" the next time @entity2 's family visited , she was in @entity252 having fluid drained from her body because her liver was not filtering fluids adequately			2
not targeting discreet communities for early prevention can have devastating consequences once they are diagnosed with cirrhosis			0
dr. @entity261 , who treated @entity2 at @entity252 in @entity80 , said concerns over continued alcoholic behavior among cirrhosis patients means most doctors wo n't provide life - saving transplants unless a patient has stopped drinking for six months			1
@entity2 was in rehabilitation when she died suddenly			1
im describes cirrhosis as a particularly cruel disease because it 's caused by scarring in the liver as it 's trying to regenerate and maintain its function against the onslaught of abuse			2
it basically hurts itself trying to survive			0
" this comes about over decades of injury to the liver , and often times it 's silent , " @entity261 says			0
the millions of people in the @entity108 who suffer from alohol - related cirrhosis , an indicator of heavy drinking , face more than just a grave health risk , particularly if they are a member of a vulnerable minority group			1
drinking excessively has also been linked to increased criminality , family and work life issues and health consequences			0
" alcoholism is one of the preventable agents that keeps @entity46 people from being able to advance in this country , " @entity189 said			0
" it affects families , it 's money that should be spent on education and providing a good household			0
if we can address and prevent this , i truly believe we would see @entity55 advance economically much more rapidly in this country			2
" while liver disease results from long - term abuse , @entity189 said , not enough research has been done as to whether higher rates of hepatitis c and fatty liver disease among @entity55 weaken the liver and increase the rates of cirrhosis			1
she also said that poor diet and lack of exercise might also be contributing factors			0
" latinos suffer alcohol use disorders , both dependency and abuse , in smaller numbers , but for those of us who drink , tomamos con ganas ( we do it with gusto ) , " she said			1
" and there are all those things that can contribute			0
" @entity2 was a journalist , a profession where much - romanticized pub crawls are legendary			1
as i told her former colleagues of her death , many asked whether something else might have caused cirrhosis or how much drinking might make you sick			1
when i told them the autopsy firmly connected her death to long - term alcohol consumption , they seemed incredulous			2
@entity343 had been a slow , unintentional suicide , aided by the many drinks she shared with her reporter buddies in celebration of the last big story			0
in that other culture of hers , no one had seen it coming either			0
problem teen drinking is not just a phase @entity2 's friends and family gather will saturday to celebrate her life and work and raise money for a scholarship fund for poor , minority journalism students devoted to continuing her work			1
i find it all so heart - crushing i ca n't bring myself to join the speech - making			0
there will just be too much talk of the importance of her kind of reporting , but little , if any , about why she died			0
i 'll remember her by telling the story of how her easy smile and zest for justice was snuffed out by an awful disease plaguing her own community			0
i just wish she were here to have written it herself .			0
