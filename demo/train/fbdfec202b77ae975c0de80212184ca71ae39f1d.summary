@entity0 -- the @entity2 voted wednesday to overturn the ban on openly gay and lesbian soldiers serving in the @entity6 military , passing legislation repealing the controversial " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			1
the bill -- a so - called " stand alone " measure not tied to any other legislative items -- passed 250 to 175 on mostly partisan lines			2
it now advances to the @entity14			2
the @entity2 previously passed a repeal of the ban as part of a larger defense policy bill , but the measure stalled last week in the @entity14			1
on wednesday , the top @entity20 and @entity21 on the @entity22 announced a compromise on a stripped - down version of the defense policy bill that cut out the " do n't ask , do n't tell " repeal language and some other provisions			1
some senators had expressed concern that the policy dispute over " do n't ask , do n't tell " and other issues could undermine the larger defense policy bill , which influences how the @entity31 spends it budget			1
also wednesday , moderate @entity33 sen. @entity33 of @entity34 announced her support for repealing " @entity36 , " but only after the @entity14 completes work on the tax and benefits package and a measure authorizing continued government spending this fiscal year			1
@entity33 became the fourth @entity21 to publicly support a repeal , giving @entity42 an opening to overcome a certain @entity21 filibuster			1
sensing momentum on the issue , president @entity45 and defense secretary @entity46 called wednesday for @entity14 approval so that the repeal can be signed into law			1
" moving forward with the repeal is not only the right thing to do , it will also give our military the clarity and certainty it deserves , " @entity45 said in a @entity53 statement			1
" we must ensure that @entity6 who are willing to risk their lives for their country are treated fairly and equally by their country			0
@entity46 " encourages the @entity14 to pass the legislation this session , enabling the @entity31 to carefully and responsibly manage a change in this policy instead of risking an abrupt change resulting from a decision in the courts , " said a statement issued by @entity31 press secretary @entity65			1
the sponsors of the measure in the @entity14 -- @entity76 independent @entity75 and @entity34 @entity21 @entity77 -- said the @entity2 vote showed bipartisan support for ending the " do n't ask , do n't tell " policy			1
" it is now the @entity14 's turn to take the final step toward overturning this discriminatory policy			1
we are out of excuses , " their statement concluded			0
in @entity2 debate before wednesday 's vote , speaker @entity88 , @entity89 , also said that " now is the time for us to act			2
" " we should honor the service of all who want to contribute " to @entity6 's security , @entity88 said			0
" @entity95 ' makes for good public policy			2
" " discrimination is wrong , " declared rep. @entity97 , @entity98			0
" on the battlefield it does not matter who you love			0
only the flag that you serve			0
" conservative republicans argued that , among other things , a repeal would place an unreasonable burden on the military at a time when it is already facing severe strains in @entity113 and elsewhere			2
this is " an imposition of somebody 's social agenda , " said rep. @entity118 , @entity119			0
it 's an " eclipse of reason , an eclipse of common sense			0
" " the @entity6 military is not the @entity124			0
it 's something special , " said rep. @entity125 , @entity126			0
this is " a liberal crusade to create a utopia			0
" @entity45 and @entity42 leaders are trying to push through a repeal before the end of the current lame - duck congressional session			1
the more conservative incoming @entity134 -- which will be seated the first week of january -- is considered far less likely to overturn the @entity136 - era ban			0
the @entity42 @entity14 caucus has 58 members , meaning @entity42 need at least two @entity21 to join them to overcome a filibuster			1
so far , republicans @entity33 , @entity141 , @entity142 of @entity143 and @entity144 of @entity145 have said they would support a repeal , but they also have stood by a @entity21 pledge to block all @entity14 business until a resolution is reached on extending the @entity151 tax cuts and authorizing continued government this fiscal year			1
both the tax package and the spending authorization proposal are being debated and were expected to be passed in some form by the end of the lame - duck session			0
however , senate majority leader @entity158 , @entity159 , warned wednesday night that @entity21 stall tactics could prevent the repeal from coming up before the current lame - duck session expires			1
" we are very quickly running out of days in this @entity134 , " @entity158 said in a statement			2
" the time for week - long negotiations on amendments and requests for days of debate is over			0
@entity21 senators who favor repealing this discriminatory policy need to join with us now to stand against those who are trying to run out the clock on this @entity134			1
" a @entity31 study released earlier this month concluded that allowing openly gay or lesbian troops to serve in the military would have little lasting impact on the @entity6 armed forces			0
opposition to the change was much higher in @entity182 and @entity184 combat units than in the military as a whole			0
@entity46 has warned that court challenges to " do n't ask , do n't tell " could force an abrupt repeal of the policy , rather than the process in the legislation that would allow the military to manage the change on a longer timetable			1
last spring , @entity46 made changes that required any fact - finding inquiries about a possible " do n't ask , do n't tell " violation in the ranks to be started by an officer with the rank of colonel or @entity203 commander or higher			2
he also initiated rules that made it more difficult for a service member to be removed because of a third - party " outing			0
" the number of military discharges made due to the policy has since dropped sharply			2
@entity1 's @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 and @entity215 contributed to this report .			0
