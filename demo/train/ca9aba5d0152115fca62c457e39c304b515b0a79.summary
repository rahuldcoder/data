-- " to report the state of the union			1
" within the first few seconds of president @entity4 's address tuesday night , he quoted the late president @entity5 , who 51 years ago used those words to describe a president 's annual duty			2
as @entity4 spoke , citizens around the country were tapping away at keyboards , posting and sending messages -- public and private -- characterizing their own view of how the union , and its president , are faring			1
@entity4 told the packed @entity17 chamber : " we can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger			2
" @entity22 : this time , a president in full and those citizens around the country , typing away , were in essence saying : we 'll be the ones to decide that , thank you very much			1
it is one of the most profound changes a modern president faces : the fact that the day is long gone when a chief executive can declare what the status of the nation is and have the words be treated as a one - directional proclamation rather than as the first salvo in an instant conversation			1
@entity40 reported that as @entity4 discussed the middle class and minimum wages , its users were posting messages at the rate of 24,000 per minute			1
tweets on @entity47 the @entity47 address , for more than a century -- from @entity49 to @entity50 -- was not even delivered verbally to @entity51			1
it was handed to the @entity17 and @entity53 on paper , and then printed -- usually in full -- in newspapers across the country			0
@entity57 studied the words as they would a major company 's annual report			2
the official version -- the hot - off - the - presses results of the nation 's yearly physical exam			0
the dynamic , of necessity , has been forever altered			0
@entity67 : @entity4 's ' do - something ' plan for a ' have - nothing ' government " i 'm also issuing a new goal for @entity57 , " @entity4 said tuesday night , and before he could even complete the sentence , he had to know that there were plenty of people who would automatically reject whatever words would follow and would not be shy about it			0
self - doubt is a characteristic that a modern president of either party must banish as he speaks			0
if he were to dwell on the fact that every single syllable he utters is being dissected in real time , it would be understandable if he were unable to make it through a paragraph			2
" we know what needs to be done , " @entity4 said , but that word -- " we " -- is itself open to daily dispute			0
a president 's voice may be , symbolically , the loudest in the republic , but it is one voice among hundreds of millions , most of them with the technological power to talk right back			1
democracy , at warp speed			0
@entity103 : @entity4 dares @entity51 to get the job done that endless and instantaneous conversation -- and it is only going to grow more constant in the decades to come -- is the contemporary reality to which each president must now adjust , the fresh fact of civic life			0
it is , in a fundamental way , the new state of the union			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity115 .			1

presidents are required to report on the @entity47
for a long time , reports were delivered in writing ; today there is a speech
@entity115 : new element is that citizens can immediately talk back with their views
@entity40 users were posting tens of *thousands* of messages a minute
