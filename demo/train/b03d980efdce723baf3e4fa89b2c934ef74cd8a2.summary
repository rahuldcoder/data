-- some 43.6 million @entity1 are expected to travel at least 50 miles from home for the @entity4 holiday , a slight increase over the 43.3 million people who traveled last year , according to @entity8 projections			1
while it 's the fourth consecutive year of growth in the number of holiday travelers , people are still finding ways to economize during the @entity4 holiday travel period ( wednesday , november 21 to sunday , november 25 )			1
most people drive rather than fly to their holiday destinations , but even more are driving this year : some 90 % of travelers will travel by car , a 0.6 percent increase			1
at the same time , the number of people flying is expected to drop from 3.2 million last year to 3.14 million this year			1
" when it come to making choices , carving turkey with family and friends trumps pinching pennies , " said @entity8 president and ceo @entity23 , speaking at a tuesday press conference			0
higher gas prices earlier in the year may have convinced some people to travel shorter distances for the holiday , @entity23 said			1
car travelers are expected to drive an average of 588 miles this year compared to 706 miles last year			1
they are also spending less on travel , with median spending expected to drop 10 % this year to $ 498			1
drivers can expect a little relief at the gas pump			0
the national average price of gasoline will drop to between $ 3.25 - 3.40 a gallon by @entity4 , according to @entity8 estimates			1
despite this year 's historically high prices , the national average dropped by nearly 40 cents a gallon since early october and is likely to continue dropping through the end of the year			2
@entity50 promises to be fully staffed even with the slight decline in air travel projections for this @entity4 holiday weekend , planes are expected to be full or nearly full			1
that 's why @entity50 head @entity56 promised tuesday that the agency will be fully staffed to speed travelers to their destinations			1
" we understand that holiday travel can be stressful and that a great trip often begins with a positive experience at the airport , " said @entity56 , speaking at a tuesday press conference at @entity61			0
" to this end , @entity50 will be fully staffed and prepared for the high volume of passengers this holiday season			2
with everyone 's security at the forefront , we continue and are committed to processing passengers as safely and efficiently as possible , " @entity56 added			2
@entity56 advised travelers to follow some basic steps to speed up the security process			1
call @entity77 with medical issues : travelers with disabilities and medical conditions should contact the @entity77 helpline ( 855 - 787 - 2227 ) before their travel dates to see if they need to take any extra steps or if they qualify for extra assistance to clear security			2
do n't wrap presents : a @entity50 officer may have to unwrap gifts to inspect the contents			2
what a drag for your kids to see what you bought them for @entity95 before the actual day ! ship desserts in advance : sometimes a pie is n't just a pie -- it 's a prohibited liquid			0
so while cakes and pies are permitted on airplanes , your confection may require further inspection and may not necessarily be permitted to board			0
remember the cupcake fiasco of 2012 ? consider baking once you get to @entity109 's house			0
follow the 3 - 1 - 1 rule : most liquids can be carried in bottles that hold 3 ounces or less , once placed in a quart - sized , clear , plastic , zipped bag to hold all of your small bottles			0
there 's a limit of one bag per passenger			0
you may have gotten away with more bottles on your business trips , but those flights likely were n't as full as your holiday flight is going to be			0
that liquid rule includes snow globes : you can bring small snow globes as carry - on luggage as long as they are less than 3.4 ounces and packed in your 3 - 1 - 1 bag			0
if you 're not sure , leave the globe at home or ship it			0
otherwise , it may get seized .			0

more @entity4 travelers are driving this year than last year
fewer people are taking to the air to *celebrate* @entity4 this year
people are spending less and driving shorter distances this year
people should still pack carefully and follow @entity50 *guidelines* when going through security
