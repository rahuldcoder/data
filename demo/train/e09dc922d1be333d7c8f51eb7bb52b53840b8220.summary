@entity0 -- @entity3 president @entity2 and @entity5 prime minister @entity4 on tuesday blasted @entity8 authorities ' decision to release the convicted @entity10 bomber last year and agreed on the need to push for a more transparent disclosure of the circumstances surrounding @entity15 's release			1
@entity4 , however , said he is opposed to a @entity5 government investigation into the release			1
the two leaders also said they addressed a range of issues in talks at the @entity22 , including the war in @entity24 , sanctions against @entity28 , the state of the global economy and the responsibilities of @entity31 -- a @entity5 company -- after the oil disaster in the @entity26			1

@entity4 said the release of @entity15 , who had been sentenced to life for his role in the bombing of @entity10 over @entity10 , @entity8 , was " wholly wrong			1
" @entity15 , he said , was " the biggest mass murder in @entity5 history			1
" the 1988 bombing killed 270 people			0
@entity4 promised that the @entity5 government will cooperate with a congressional investigation into the controversy , though he stressed that the decision to release @entity15 was made by the @entity8 government without any involvement from @entity31			1
" there is absolutely no harm to be done in giving the fullest possible explanation " regarding the decision to release @entity15 , @entity4 said			1
" but i do n't think there 's any great mystery here			0
it was simply a " misguided decision " by @entity8 authorities			2
the @entity8 government freed @entity15 last august on compassionate grounds after doctors said he had terminal prostate cancer and just three months to live			1
@entity15 is still alive nearly a year later , and news reports in recent days have questioned whether he was as sick as depicted			2

the @entity8 government has insisted that @entity31 never lobbied to free @entity15			1
secretary of state @entity81 and four @entity3 senators from @entity83 and @entity84 have called for @entity5 to revisit the case , even though there is little chance that @entity15 will be returned to custody from his native @entity77			1
@entity4 was scheduled to meet with the senators during his visit to @entity0			2
@entity2 said most @entity3 were " surprised , disappointed and angry " about the decision to let @entity15 go			1
" we should have all the facts , " he added			0
" they should be laid out there			0
" the decision " ran contrary to how we should be treating terrorists			0
" turning to @entity31 's responsibilities after the @entity98 , @entity4 said he " completely understands " the anger that exists " across @entity3			1
" " it is @entity31 's role to cap the leak , to clean up the mess , and to pay appropriate compensation , " he said			2
" i 'm in regular touch with senior management at @entity31 , and the president is , too , to make sure that happens			2
" the two men said they were united in their goals for the @entity24 war and in terms of preventing @entity114 's acquisition of nuclear weapons			0
@entity4 , however , remains under pressure at home to end the @entity5 involvement in the @entity24 campaign			2
@entity5 is the second - largest contributor of troops to the military coalition fighting @entity124 insurgents , behind only the @entity3			2
@entity2 also indicated they had both reaffirmed their commitment to fiscal responsibility in light of spiraling deficits in the major @entity132 economies			0
at the same time , the president stressed that different countries are taking slightly different approaches , depending on their specific circumstances			0
@entity2 has pushed for the need for greater stimulus spending in the short term while addressing deficits as more of a long - term issue ; @entity4 entered office pledging the enactment of immediate austerity measures			2
in keeping with those measures , his office said earlier , the prime minister flew on a commercial flight to @entity0			0
while their different approaches to the economic crisis underscore their different political orientations , @entity2 and @entity4 , according to many observers , also have a great deal in common			0
