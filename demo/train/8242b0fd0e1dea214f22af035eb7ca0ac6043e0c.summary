-- my name is @entity3			1
i am an @entity4 , a mother , a feminist , a baker , a wife , an atheist and a @entity10			1
i am also a brain cancer survivor and an activist for brain cancer research and patient care			1
but when i fill out the @entity16 , all it will reflect is that i am a 55 - year - old white woman , and nothing about how i got to this point in life			0
when i was growing up in @entity20 , @entity21 , in the ' 60s and ' 70s , @entity4 was in a state of flux			1
everywhere you looked , there were battles going on as traditional beliefs were being challenged			0
i knew i was an @entity4 , but i also wanted @entity4 to change			1
on television and in the media , men and women were arguing about their roles , whites and blacks were arguing about racism , people were demonstrating against the @entity36 and wondering if @entity37 was dead			0
the very idea that everything can be challenged and changed is @entity4 to me			1
i suspect the sides i took in those early years define me			0
it was exciting , and a lot of good came of it , and also some bad			0
that 's the way of it			2
after graduating from @entity46 , i moved to @entity47 , @entity48			1
seven years later , i attended @entity49 as a continuing education student			2
this chance for later education , to change the direction of one 's life , is wonderfully @entity4			1
while in @entity47 , i met my husband			1
when our daughters were 1 and 4 years old , we moved to @entity59 , @entity60			1
we always wanted to experience @entity61 , and we thought if not now , never			2
we lived in @entity59 for almost 15 years			1
the kids went to @entity64 schools and then to international schools			0
i opened and ran @entity66			2
i was an @entity4 living abroad			1
then five years ago , i was diagnosed with glioblastoma multiforme brain cancer			1
the doctors told me the grim prognosis : i should prepare to die			0
my mother died when i was young , and the worst part of the diagnosis was thinking i would leave my daughters with that pain			0
i also wanted to be a good example			2
i had surgery to remove the tumor			2
the week i got out of the hospital , i began exercising			0
while the staples were still in my head , through the radiation and chemotherapy , i exercised			0
i was so lucky that i was able to			0
very slowly , i got stronger			0
that first year , i did a half - marathon			0
not fast , but i did it			0
after the surgery and the radiation and the 2Â½ years of chemo , i was pronounced " in remission			2
" during this time , as i split my time between homes in @entity91 , @entity92 , and @entity93 , i did several @entity95 races , indoor rowing competitions , and the @entity98 @entity97			0
these events transformed my life physically , emotionally and spiritually			0
brain cancer was a wake - up call for our whole family			1
the shock was n't that i was going to die , but that i had forgotten that i was going to die			0
life is n't a dress rehearsal			0
i had been attending the @entity109 's @entity108 in @entity110 , @entity111 , for three years when i realized that i had become a long - term survivor			0
and i realized i wanted to help change the statistics			2
brain cancer patients need new , better treatments , and for that , we need more research			1
to help raise awareness and funds to battle brain cancer , i formed brains on bikes			1
the project consists of me and my trainer and friend @entity125 cycling from @entity127 , @entity128 , across @entity4 to @entity129 we started friday and aim to finish on july 15			2
my very @entity4 life has taught me to try to change things that do n't work			1
i truly believe that together , we can outsmart brain cancer			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity3 .			2

@entity3 grew up in @entity21 in ' 60 's , ' 70s ; knew she wanted @entity4 to change
she says she moved to @entity47 and *pursued* @entity4 *option* of later *college* education
she moved to @entity59 and opened a bakery ; later , she learned she had brain cancer
after surgery and remission , she formed brains on bikes to raise funds for cancer research
