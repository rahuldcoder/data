food banks across the country kicked into high gear for the holiday season this week in an effort to feed @entity4 's hungry			0
but a few instead homed in on an often overlooked casualty of hard times -- the family pet			0
" it 's the forgotten pets that go by the wayside , " said @entity8 , founder of an @entity10 - based nonprofit group called @entity11			1
appalled by tales of pet owners compelled to hand over their cats and dogs to shelters , @entity8 formed her organization in 2008 in an effort to provide cash - strapped owners a way to keep their canine and feline friends			1
each year , between 3 million and 4 million cats and dogs in shelters are euthanized , according to the @entity29 , a @entity30 - based animal advocacy group			1
" i 've had people say to me , ' i 'm down to my last half bag ( of pet food ) and i do n't know what to do , ' " @entity8 said			1
" people sometimes just cry because they need help			0
" but @entity8 , also the pet food bank 's executive director , said that unlike traditional food banks , her group does n't typically benefit from a resource boost around the holidays			1
" most people do n't think to give to us and funding is a big problem , " she said			0
" a lot of the homeless shelters also do n't allow pets			0
so a lot people often just drive up to the local animal control centers and push their dogs out , " unable to feed them , she added			2
some people , out of work or under - employed , are forced to live in their cars but still refuse to say goodbye to their animal companions , she noted			0
" they do n't want to turn their pets over to shelters , because many of the shelters are full and ( their pets ) will be put to sleep , " @entity8 said			1
" people do n't realize that pets , they 're family too			0
" one such family member is a 12 - year - old @entity71 shepherd named @entity72 -- a favorite of @entity75 's late husband , who died of prostate cancer more than a decade ago			1
" he loved that dog , " said @entity75 , 57 , who became homeless earlier this year after moving to @entity10 in search of work			1
" he 's the last link that i have to my husband			0
" whatever i do , i have to do my best to keep him alive			0
" @entity75 , a former business owner and insurance broker from @entity84 , @entity85 , said she lost her business in 2009			2
bunking with friends , she was ultimately forced to camp out on a park bench with her dog near a @entity91 food market in downtown @entity10			1
" no shelter would take me and that dog , " she said			2
she eventually turned to @entity8 's organization , which paid a week 's motel bills , plus @entity72 's food and medicine			1
" i now have a job lined up with another insurance company , " as well a prospective apartment for rent , noted @entity75			2
but she still must find a way to pay a $ 350 deposit			0
" if i ca n't , me and @entity72 will be back in front of that @entity91 's			0
" @entity75 's story is not unusual , noted @entity8 , whose group currently works with about 500 other food banks nationwide			1
she also partners with corporations such @entity110 and @entity111 , as well as the @entity112 , headed by comedian and talk - show host @entity115			0
since 2008 , @entity8 's organization has swelled to more than 30 volunteers			2
and through corporate and private donors , it 's shelled out more than a million pounds of pet food , trucking and mailing the donations to thousands of down - on - their - luck families			1
@entity125 networks , such as @entity126 -- with which @entity8 is affiliated -- have helped to connect the efforts of like - minded organizations			2
" @entity126 is doing for pets what the food bank network has successfully done for people in this country for more than 40 years , " said @entity129 , vice president at @entity130			0
" this partnership is the perfect way to give much - needed support to the shelter and rescue communities and change the lives of homeless pets everywhere			2

@entity8 is the founder of an @entity10 - based nonprofit group called @entity11
the group provides pet food and medicine to pet owners , who are unable to afford for it
