-- the 222nd @entity1 -- a match between @entity3 and @entity4 which epitomizes the ultimate in team rivalry -- turned into an individual showcase for the two greatest players in world football and fittingly ended in a 2 - 2 draw sunday			1
@entity3 's @entity11 scored twice to put his side 2 - 1 ahead in their @entity13 after an early strike from @entity4 's @entity15			1
but the @entity17 star drew the reigning @entity19 champions level on the hour mark with his second goal and almost certainly kept their title hopes alive			0
they trail leaders @entity3 by eight points after seven games , 11 would have been almost insurmountable			2
a draw was probably a fair result although it is unlikely the majority of the 98,000 fans who crammed into @entity3 's magnificent home stadium would have agreed			2
because at stake is not just the result of a football match but the very pride and honor of the @entity39 people			0
@entity41 calls many from this semi-autonomous region of @entity19 want full independence and last month more than a million people demanded just that in a demonstration in @entity3			0
former @entity3 manager @entity47 publicly supported that ambition , which has gathered pace in the austerity - hit country , with many @entity53 citizens believing they are paying more than their fair share into the coffers of the government in @entity4			1
this feeling of @entity39 identity embodied in a football club is summed up by @entity3 's motto " @entity3 " -- more than a club , and clashes against @entity4 are chances to give vent to their feelings			1
austerity gives @entity1 added twist the passionate atmosphere sunday went up a notch as @entity3 officials allowed fans to display the yellow and red colors of @entity53 in a giant mosaic , holding up cards to get the effect			1
and at exactly 17 minutes and 14 seconds , chants for independence rang out in reference to the @entity39 ' military defeat to the @entity82 in the @entity83 in 1714			0
political football @entity3 's central defender @entity85 had tweeted saturday that he wanted politics to say out of @entity1			1
" the games between @entity3 and @entity4 increasingly resemble @entity53 against @entity19 and this should not happen , " he wrote			1
" it 's just a football match			0
" whether all his fellow players agreed with @entity85 , they certainly missed him in defense as he was ruled out by injury			0
the full throated chants had barely subsided when @entity15 ran through a big gap in the @entity3 back line and shot past @entity98 on 22 minutes			2
it was a record sixth goal in six matches against @entity3 and @entity4 would be left to rue a miss by @entity102 soon afterwards which might have led to a different result			2
his mishit shot hit the post and by halftime @entity11 had equalized after hesitation in the @entity4 defense			2
is this @entity1 a must win game for @entity4 ? in the second half , @entity11 was fouled just outside the @entity112 and got up to send an unstoppable free kick past @entity114			1
but @entity15 replied when weakness at the heart of the home defense was again evident and he equalized with a low shot			0
both sides had chances to grab the three points but had to settle for a draw			0
controversial invite the political undertones behind the latest @entity1 found further expression in the decision by @entity3 to invite @entity126 , a former @entity127 soldier who was held captive in @entity128 for nearly five years			1
it risked alienating their many supporters in the @entity133 region and the @entity135 government called for a boycott of the television coverage			0
@entity3 responded by inviting a former @entity133 international player @entity138 , who had been detained by the @entity127 , but he declined to come .			0

@entity3 draw 2 - 2 with @entity4 in @entity1
two goals *apiece* from @entity11 and @entity15
@entity39 giants @entity3 stay eight points clear of arch - rivals
@entity146 held against *backdrop* of growing demands for indepedence for @entity53
