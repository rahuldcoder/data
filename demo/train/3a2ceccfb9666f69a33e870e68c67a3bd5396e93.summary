@entity0 , @entity1 -- on tuesday morning , the residents of @entity4 , @entity1 , woke again to another nightmare			1
in the past 14 years , @entity4 and its nearby neighbors have been subjected to devastation from three major tornado events			1
the latest chapter in this nearly unimaginable history was the @entity13 tornado that claimed the lives of 24 people and injured hundreds			2
but how unusual is this tornado in context ? while the frequency is unusual , especially over such a short period , the actual tornado is less of an anomaly			1
over the same 14 years , there were a number of similar events			1
the @entity25 , @entity26 , tornado of may 22 , 2011 , destroyed 25 % of the town and killed 158 people			2
the path length for the @entity25 tornado was similar in length and width , about 20 miles long and 1.5 miles wide			2
the " original " @entity4 tornado on may 3,1999 , was rated @entity35 ( @entity36 now uses the enhanced @entity38 scale , called the " @entity13 " scale )			1
it killed 36 people in @entity4 and had a similar path length			1
on april 27 , 2011 , fifteen @entity13 and @entity13 tornadoes tracked across @entity44 and @entity45 -- many having damage tracks that extended for dozens of miles			0
so while horrible and sad , this extreme class of tornado occurs regularly in the @entity50			1
and when these tornadoes travel across populated areas , we see their awesome power at its worst			0
so what do we know about the conditions that cause these violent storms ? first , the atmosphere must be what is called potentially unstable			0
potentially means the atmosphere must first build up heat and moisture near the ground , like fueling the gas tank of your car for a long trip			0
unstable means that if an imaginary balloon filled with air from near the ground were to be lifted upward , colliding with some weather feature such as a cold front , the " balloon " would become warmer than the surrounding air at that level			0
the initial " push " upward by the cold front on that balloon filled with surface air is like a child letting a helium - filled balloon go -- it just keeps rising			0
the difference is that on these violent tornado days , the balloon does not just rise in a leisurely way			2
it slingshots upward , especially when the air inside cools enough to condense all the water vapor it carries			0
it 's the extra heat released when the water vapor condenses that is like a driver flooring a car 's accelerator			2
the balloon of surface air quickly reaches speeds of 100 to 150 mph going straight up ! our " balloons " -- meteorologists call them " updrafts " -- are the engines of the storm			0
the energy released in the updrafts then interacts with our second ingredient needed for violent tornadoes , the change of the wind direction and speed at you go upward from the ground			0
anyone who has flown knows that the wind speed increases with height			0
these violent storms almost always require that the wind speeds increase from 20 mph on the ground to more than 100 mph ( horizontally ) aloft			0
spin in the storm 's updraft is enhanced when the air entering the base of the updraft is from the south , while the winds further aloft are flowing from west to east			1
this is the so - called jet stream , the fast river of air that helps drive our weather , which interacts with the storm 's updrafts to create a spinning column of air			1
it is this updraft spin , or mesocyclone , that creates the tornado			1
when the updrafts are strong and the wind shear large , the spin inside the mesocyclone becomes very fast			0
and in the most extreme cases , a violent tornado is born beneath that spinning white cloud of updraft that meteorologists call the supercell thunderstorm			1
so how well can we predict these storms ? tornado deaths during the past 50 years have declined considerably , indicating our forecasting and warning skill has improved considerably			1
the deployment of the doppler radar system in the early 1990s by the @entity36 extended tornado warning lead times from five minutes to their now - annual average of 12 to 14 minutes			1
but other factors have improved warnings as well since then			2
during the past 20 years , supercell thunderstorms have been the focus of intense academic and government research to understand how they work and how they produce tornadoes			1
two major field programs have studied these storms using dozens of mobile weather stations , aircraft and doppler radars			2
the result from all these years of research and training was displayed monday			1
forecasters from the @entity178 in @entity0 , @entity1 , were very aware that the atmosphere in and around central @entity1 had all the ingredients for significant tornadoes			1
knowing that the atmosphere could produce a strong tornado , they immediately issued the tornado warning as soon as the doppler radar started to show low - level rotation within the storm			0
this warning was 16 minutes before the touchdown of the @entity4 tornado outside of @entity190 , @entity1 , and nearly an hour before the end of the tornado some 20 miles away			1
undoubtedly , the long lead time saved countless lives			0
i 'm one of a number of researchers at @entity36 who are working on ways to combine all of the environmental , radar and other weather data into a computer model that will attempt to predict when the tornado will develop and how strong it will be as much as an hour in advance			0
this " @entity207 " concept , while showing promise , is still years away from being a reality			0
so until then , when you hear the tornado sirens or tornado warning , take cover immediately			0
like the people in @entity4 , your life may depend on it			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity218 .			0

*author* : hard to *fathom* three major tornado events have hit @entity4 , @entity1 , in 14 years
he says it 's not unusual for an extreme tornado to strike the @entity226
a tornado can form when a sharp updraft meets faster winds of the jet stream
predictions have improved , but research may yield further advances , he says
