the dark claim on the day @entity1 died took many by surprise			2
someone , @entity5 government officials said , may have deliberately infected him with cancer			2
critics dismissed the accusation -- first floated by then - vice president @entity10 on march 5 -- as an eleventh - hour attempt to distract @entity5 and drum up popular support as leaders prepared to announce @entity1 's death			1
but @entity10 revived the issue this week , announcing that planning was in the works for a commission of " the world 's best scientists " to investigate whether @entity1 had been poisoned			1
@entity1 gone , but far from forgotten as @entity5 presidential campaigns start in an interview with the @entity24 network hours after he registered to run for president monday , @entity10 implied that the @entity26 could have been behind such an attack on @entity1 -- an accusation that the @entity29 has denied			1
" we have this intuition that our commander @entity1 was poisoned by dark forces that wanted to be rid of him , " said @entity10 , who was sworn in as @entity5 's interim president on friday			1
in the 1940s and 1950s , the @entity26 and other countries had " scientific laboratories testing how to cause cancer , " @entity10 said			1
" seventy years have passed			0
these kinds of laboratories of evil and death have not advanced ? " @entity10 stressed that he was not accusing the @entity26			2
" i am just saying something that is a truth , that is known , " he said			0
but his recent comments have drawn sharp responses from the @entity26 government			0
@entity5 : will ' @entity48 ' survive ? " an assertion that the @entity26 was somehow involved in causing president @entity1 's illness is absurd , and we definitively reject it , " @entity29 spokesman @entity49 said last week			1
it is n't the first time that a @entity5 government official has implied that a plot could be behind @entity1 's cancer			1
@entity1 made the assertion himself in 2011 , saying at a military event in @entity61 that he wondered whether the @entity26 could be infecting @entity63 leaders with the illness			1
@entity1 cited the revelation that between 1946 and 1948 , the @entity26 had carried out human experiments in @entity67 where subjects were exposed to sexually transmitted diseases			2
the @entity26 government apologized for those experiments in 2010			0
" would it be strange if ( the @entity26 ) had developed a technology to induce cancer , " he asked , " and for no one to know it ? " @entity10 announced on march 5 that @entity1 had died			1
the news came nearly two years after @entity1 had revealed his cancer diagnosis in june 2011			0
while government announcements of @entity1 's trips to @entity80 for treatment were common , officials never revealed details about his prognosis or specified what kind of cancer he had			2
@entity10 has remained tight - lipped , even while telling @entity24 that details about @entity1 's illness make officials " almost certain " that there was foul play			1
" we are almost certain based on the data we have , " @entity10 said			0
" he had an illness , a cancer that will be known in time , that broke with all the typical characteristics of this illness			0
" dr. @entity97 , an oncologist and past president of the @entity99 , told @entity100 tuesday that assertions that injections or poisons could have caused @entity1 's cancer have " absolutely no scientific substance			1
" " @entity105 can not sustain this hypothesis , " @entity97 said			0
any scientific investigation into @entity1 's death , @entity97 said , could be complicated by the fact that @entity1 's body has already been embalmed so that it can be placed on display in a @entity61 museum			1
" if they want to investigate ... they should have already taken all the tissue samples , " he said			0
it 's unlikely the scientific commission @entity10 spoke of this week will ever be formed , according to @entity118 , a @entity5 analyst and former diplomat			0
" this is political speculation , " he told @entity100 en @entity120			0
" they have wanted to use to the maximum @entity1 's death for political purposes			2
" making the poor count -- a @entity1 legacy			0

*doctor* : there is " no scientific substance " to claims that @entity1 was deliberately infected
president @entity10 says he will invite " the world 's best scientists " to study @entity1 's illness
the interim leader says he *suspects* @entity1 " was poisoned by dark forces "
the @entity29 denies accusations of @entity26 involvement , calling them " absurd "
