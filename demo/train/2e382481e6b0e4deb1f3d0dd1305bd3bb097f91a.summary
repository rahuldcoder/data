-- what personal information does your mobile phone reveal about you ? do you care ? many @entity4 do , according to new research from the @entity6 that sheds some light on mobile - privacy concerns			1
according to @entity6 's report , 54 % of cell phone users in the @entity4 have decided not to install an app once they discovered how much of their personal information it would access			1
( the amount of sensitive info an app can access typically is indicated by the " permissions " the app requests , listed on its information page			2
) also , nearly one - third of mobile app users report uninstalling an app from their phone because they learned it was collecting personal information they did n't wish to share			1
people from the lowest - income households ( earning $ 30,000 or less per year ) and men across all demographics were most likely to report taking this step			0
but many mobile - privacy concerns stem not from the apps you download , but from what can happen with a device that can divulge so much sensitive information once it 's out of your hands -- especially when it 's in someone else 's hands			1
most cell phone users are somewhat aware of mobile privacy and many take at least some basic measures to protect it			1
according to @entity6 : 41 % of cell phone owners back up at least the photos , contacts , and other files from their phone			1
32 % have cleared their phone 's web browsing or search history			1
30 % of all cell phone owners ( and 60 % of smartphone owners ) say they back up the entire contents of their phone ( apps , data , files , etc. ) 19 % ( especially younger phone owners ) have turned off their phone 's location - tracking feature due to concerns that companies or other people might access that information			1
of course , regardless of whether you turn off location tracking on your phone , your wireless carrier knows ( and keeps a record of ) where your phone is at all times it 's connected to the cell network			1
carriers can surrender this information to law enforcement , and it 's unclear what else they may be doing with this data			0
but typically , most people do n't think clearly or consistently about mobile privacy			2
that 's why , at the mobile technology workshops i often run , one of my favorite exercises is this : i simply tell participants to take out their cell phone , look at it , and consider how much important and sensitive information is on that device , how much they depend on it			2
then i say : hand over your cell phone to the person sitting next to you			0
i let them sit there a bit , watching them grow visibly anxious			0
about 30 seconds later i ask them them how they feel			0
" nervous " is a common response			0
so are " exposed , " " weird " and " scared			0
" " ok , hand back those phones , " i say			0
" now you see -- these are n't just gadgets , they 're part of your life			0
they 're part of you			0
" according to @entity6 , nearly a third of cell owners have lost their phones or had them stolen			2
owners of smartphones and more basic phones are equally likely to say their phone has been lost or stolen , the survey says			0
when your phone is lost or stolen , it can help if you do n't totally lose access to everything you had on the device			2
about 60 % of smartphone owners told @entity6 that they back up the contents of their phone			1
still , having a phone go missing does n't necessarily make cell phone users more cautious			1
@entity6 noted : " @entity145 owners who have actually experienced a lost or stolen phone are no more likely than average to back up the contents of their phone			2
" routinely protecting your phone with a passcode or pattern is an easy way to prevent unauthorized access to your phone			2
many mobile security services also offer location tracking for lost phones , and give you the option of remotely locking or wiping data from a lost or stolen phone			1
cell phone snooping is also a concern			0
@entity6 reports that 12 % of all @entity4 cell phone owners " have had another person access the contents of their phone in a way that made them feel their privacy was invaded			1
" smartphone owners and younger owners ( age 18 - 24 ) of any kind of cell phone are twice as likely to have had this experience			0
of people who told @entity6 that someone accessed the contents of their phone without their permission , nearly 60 % are " much more likely than average to conduct regular backups , " compared to just 39 % of those whose phones have not been snooped			1
at least , not as far as they know			0
@entity6 's results came from a nationwide survey of 2,254 adults conducted in march and april			2
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity186 .			0
