-- @entity1 raped and battered at least seven women			0
he killed four , and left the others for dead -- the bodies dumped around @entity5 and the neighboring city of @entity7 , @entity8 , between 1986 and 1987			0
he was caught and , just as in the civilian system , he was tried			0
he was found guilty by a jury of his peers , just as in the civilian system			0
and a death sentence was passed , just as would have been possible in a civilian court for such a heinous crime			1
but when it comes to staying alive , history is on @entity1 's side			2
the @entity20 military has not executed one of its own since 1961			1
the former soldier came close to being put to death in 2008 , when then president @entity25 signed a warrant authorizing @entity1 's execution -- a requirement for capital punishment in the military			1
a federal court gave @entity1 a last - minute temporary stay , and today he -- along with four other former servicemen -- remains on the military 's death row at @entity35 , @entity36			1
army maj. @entity37 may become the next resident of the military 's death row , if he is convicted for the shooting rampage at @entity41 that killed 13 people and sentenced to death			1
opening statements in the murder trial are scheduled to begin august 6			0
legal issues , including whether cases were handled appropriately , have affected some cases , analysts say			0
a look at the last @entity20 soldier executed by the military but a larger part of the equation appears to be the sometimes cloistered military culture , from a commanding general who can override a jury 's verdict to the routine military reshuffling of personnel , including prosecutors , defense attorneys and witnesses , every two or three years			1
" the military is a community of solidarity , a brotherhood and sisterhood , all to its own , " defense lawyer @entity63 said			2
" there is a real reluctance to execute fellow soldiers unless it 's absolutely the worst kind of case and this is the only way			2
" there is little disagreement by the @entity74 that the death penalty is used only in extreme cases			2
but that does n't mean it wo n't mete out or carry out the punishment , it says			2
" adherence to the law , due process , and respect for the rights of someone accused of crime , combined with respect for civilian oversight of the military justice system , should not be mistaken for an unwillingness to execute the law , " said lt. col. s. @entity81 , an @entity74 spokesman at the @entity82			2

@entity100 , sentenced to death in 1989 when he was 21 years old for robbing and murdering two cab drivers -- a retired sergeant and a soldier moonlighting to earn extra money -- at @entity41 , @entity106			2
sent to an intimidating prison with a brick @entity109 ade at @entity35 , @entity36 , loving for a time was expected to be the first person the military put to death in decades			1
military officers and other important types were shown where he was kept in the stark prison known as " the @entity97 , " reserved for the worst of the worst and the inspiration for a book and later a movie , " @entity97 , " starring @entity121 as a court - martialed general			2
they were told , @entity98 says , that @entity100 would soon be executed			2
today , " the @entity97 " has been rendered obsolete , and @entity100 is awaiting execution in a new , state - of - the - art military prison			2
" me and my client were essentially expecting an execution within 18 months , and here we are all these years later , " said @entity98 , who represented @entity100 as a military defense attorney and now as a civilian			2
executing troops the @entity20 military has executed 135 men since 1916 -- considered the start of the era of the modern fighting force -- for crimes ranging from murder to rape , according to the non-profit @entity140 in @entity141 only 10 of these executions have taken place since 1951			1
the @entity20 military carried out its last execution on april 13 , 1961 , with the hanging of @entity74 pvt. @entity146 , who was convicted in 1955 of the rape and attempted murder of an 11 - year - old @entity150 girl			1
a number of death sentences were converted to life sentences in 1983 when a military appeals court found the death penalty was unconstitutional because of problems with the armed forces ' sentencing guidelines			1
a year later , president @entity159 reinstated capital punishment in the military			1
of the 16 people sent to the military 's death row since 1984 , 11 have had their sentences overturned			1
two of those decisions were taken by commanding generals			0
the other nine cases were overturned by military appeals courts over various questions about the application of law			1
unlike in civilian courts where prosecutors decide charges , a commanding general -- who has other duties -- decides whether a military defendant will face the death penalty			1
that general also can reduce a sentence			0
it 's one of the biggest differences with the civilian system and it leads to one of the major criticisms of the decentralized nature of the military judicial system , where each branch operates independently			1
" even if you have two identical cases , one being prosecuted by one commander at one base and other being prosecuted by a commander at another base , you may have different outcomes because the commanders may have different philosophies , " said @entity193 , a former @entity194 prosecutor and judge who now works as a civilian attorney specializing in military death penalty appeals			1
such was the case with @entity208 , a @entity194 who was sentenced to death in 1990 for killing and nearly decapitating a woman with a sword near @entity212			0
a jury returned a sentence of death for @entity208 , but a commanding general overturned the decision and gave him life			1
at the time , the general cited a reluctance to authorize the execution of a service member during a military conflict -- the @entity223 , according to published accounts			0
" he did n't want to impose the death penalty , and it struck me as strange because the jury had heard and evaluated all the evidence and decided that 's what he should get , " said @entity225 , a retired @entity194 prosecutor who helmed the @entity208 case			1
as a result , @entity225 believes the problem lies not with military juries but rather with what follows : the commanding general and the appeals process			0
once the death penalty has been handed down , an appeal is automatic and eventually reviewed by the military 's top court , the @entity239 -- even if the service member does n't want it			1
" it 's a very slow process , and i do n't think they like the idea of confirming the death penalty , " said @entity225 , who now works as a civilian attorney who specializes in defending military clients			1
today , the death sentences of all five men on the military 's death row are either on appeal or under legal review			1
" the process by which legal matters in the military are adjudicated are taken extraordinarily seriously by a professional panel of peers that weigh all matters and due consideration at their due course , " said @entity74 lt. col. @entity257 , a @entity82 spokesman			0
military chiefs oppose removing commanders from sexual assault probes fewer cases if the @entity223 affected the @entity208 case , it may also have had a wider impact			0
the 1990 - 1991 conflict was the first major deployment of @entity20 troops since @entity275 and may have made the military switch its focus , says @entity278 , who co-authored a study that examined the military death penalty system			1
she found fewer death penalty cases brought by the military in recent decades			1
" the important break point in the study is 1990 , " she said			0
@entity278 did not come to conclusions for why this happened in her study , which addressed racial questions			0
but she told @entity0 that while legal changes in 1997 could have played a role by adding the option of a sentence of life without the possibility of parole , it does n't explain the drop in death penalty prosecutions before 1997			0
that 's where the buildup to and fighting of the @entity223 , from 1990 - 1991 may have played a role			0
" maybe that made the military focus in a different way , " she said			0
but @entity304 , a former judge advocate who teaches military justice at @entity306 , said there is " insufficient data to draw a broad conclusion			0
" " anyone who commits multiple murders is a viable candidate for a capital prosecution , regardless of the setting , " he said			0
" the more victims , the likelier			0
" present day @entity74 staff sgt. @entity315 pleaded guilty last month to avoid the death penalty for killing 16 @entity318 civilians in @entity319 in march 2012			1
most legal experts agree the case against @entity37 , the @entity74 psychiatrist accused of opening fire in 2009 at a deployment center at @entity41 , will be tough to overcome -- given the evidence			1
" this is broad daylight , multiple assaults before witnesses on a base , " @entity304 said			0
" as capital cases go , this is an easy one			0
" but whether a jury hands down a death sentence remains to be seen			0
and whether any death sentence is carried out is even more at question			0
@entity336 orders review of military judicial authority			0
