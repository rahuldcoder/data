@entity0 , @entity1 -- inside the @entity5 -- home to the returning @entity1 @entity4 -- @entity8 toreadors @entity6 and @entity9 were effectively left to slog it out by their peers in sunday 's race			1
@entity9 flew from ninth to fourth by the end of the first lap to once again put himself into a fight with his teammate and chief world title rival			1
the two @entity8 circled each other like silver sharks in the final 20 laps around the undulating circuit but each time @entity9 bit into @entity6 's lead , the @entity22 responded			1
there was to be no final attack and @entity6 took a third win of the season to stretch his lead in the 2014 @entity32 drivers ' championship to 29 points			1
" it 's a nice gap , " said @entity6 , who remains determined to stem rising expectation that he will emulate his father @entity36 and be crowned world champion			1
" it 's still so early in the season			0
i 'm more or less taking it step by step , and every weekend my aim is to extend the lead			0
" it worked out well and i 'm extremely happy with the result			0
" interactive : results and standings @entity9 had hampered his chances of clawing back ground on his rival and long - term friend after making a mistake in qualifying saturday			2
the 2008 champion 's fastest time was scratched because he infringed the rules by running wide at @entity59 and he then spun on this second attempt to grab pole position			0
@entity9 made amends sunday with a sensational start , which saw him jump five places on the opening lap. he then passed the @entity66 of @entity67 after the first round of pit stops to start the chase to @entity6			1
" it was a good start , " @entity9 said			2
" it 's probably one of the best i 've ever had			0
" ( it was ) damage limitation to get from ninth to second behind @entity6			2
in the last couple of laps i tried to eke it up a bit but i 'm just grateful i finished			0
" the @entity80 racer has retired twice this season while @entity6 has sailed to three race wins and five second places			1
a resurgent @entity66 team announced itself as @entity8 ' closest rivals after @entity86 had taken pole position ahead of teammate @entity67			1
but the former champions appeared to run a conservative race , content to settle with third place for @entity67 -- the first podium of the @entity95 's career -- rather than risk a solid result by taking the fight to @entity8			1
dictated by @entity66 ' tire strategy , @entity86 had to pit for fresh rubber three laps after @entity6 , effectively surrendering the lead			1
the @entity102 eventually finished fourth			0
@entity67 said : " overall it was my best ever weekend so i 'm really happy			2
" we need to analyze if there was anything we could have done better			0
it was difficult to know the real difference between optimum ( supersoft tire ) and prime ( soft tire ) so we really thought it would be difficult to undercut			0
" @entity1 billionaire @entity114 is credited with returning the @entity1 @entity4 to the calendar after an 11 - year absence			2
after revamping the picturesque @entity5 circuit and renaming it the @entity5 , the owner of the race team with the same name probably expected to see his four - time world champions run rings round the competition			1
it was ironic that the power - dependent circuit did not suit @entity129 's car or the 2014 @entity131 engines that give his @entity132 their muscle			1
@entity135 -- a surprise winner in @entity137 last time out -- finished eighth while reigning world champion @entity140 had to suffer the ignominy of retiring with engine trouble at the halfway point			2
" it was frustrating today , " said @entity135			0
" we tried to push and catch the others but we just did n't have that much pace			0
" @entity148 and his @entity150 teammate @entity149 , who finished 10th , were the only cars inside the top - 10 which are not powered by the @entity8 hybrid engines			1
@entity148 finished a hard - worked fifth ahead of @entity155 's @entity154 , @entity157 's @entity156 , @entity135 and the second @entity154 of @entity158			0
the @entity129 brand may have its own race team and a beautiful circuit but there is growing speculation a @entity129 engine could be a future project for the team 's technical guru @entity166			1
" we want to make sure we 're competitive for the long term , " team principal @entity168 said after sunday 's race			2
" designing and manufacturing our own engine currently is n't part of that plan			0
" it 's highly improbable			0
first of all we need to see what the plans for @entity131 are			0
" we 've obviously had a lot of success with @entity131 but the situation is n't improving and the reliability and performance is unacceptable			0
" it ca n't continue like this -- it 's not good for @entity131 and it 's not good for @entity129			2
" as @entity32 returned to @entity1 , the hills were alive with the sound of @entity8 music .			1
