the pilots ' bravery can not be overstated , @entity10 founder @entity9 said			1
the goal of commercial spaceflight remains unchanged , he added			2
but with one pilot 's death , injuries to another and the loss of the aircraft , there are questions that must be answered along with the inspiring words			1
@entity4 , @entity9 admitted , will not " push on blindly			1

the test aircraft went down about 20 miles northeast of @entity29			0
" this was a test flight , and test flights are typically very well - documented in terms of data , " @entity26 acting chairman @entity33 said			0
" we may have lots of evidence that will help us with the investigative process , and we appreciate that			0
" while answers for what went wrong with the test flight might be days away , @entity4 and its partner in @entity29 , @entity45 , identified the pilots at the controls of the aircraft			1
@entity51 , 39 , died in the friday incident			1
he was the co-pilot , @entity45 said			1

nobody underestimates the risks involved in space travel			0
" the company , he said , will not " push on blindly			0

it was what did n't happen next during the test flight , he said			0
@entity160 did not offer details but appeared to indicate the spaceplane did not follow its previous test - flight patterns			0
nothing seemed abnormal during the takeoff or flight before the spaceplane 's failure , @entity160 told reporters			2
for years , @entity4 has planned to sell trips in which @entity3 transports passengers about 62 miles above @entity177 -- the beginning of outer space -- and lets them experience a few minutes of weightlessness before returning to ground			2

the jet - powered @entity185 returned safely to the @entity161 , @entity160 said			0
