he said the @entity41 security pact with @entity179 does extend to the islands -- known as @entity190 to the @entity187 -- and insisted his implicit offer to defend them against any @entity187 incursion did not amount to drawing a red line around the contested land			0

those officials have come under withering criticism , accused of botching the search and keeping family members of those on board in the dark			0
so far , the @entity107 has avoided faulting @entity225 leaders for the efforts , instead highlighting the @entity41 efforts to help find the plane			0
