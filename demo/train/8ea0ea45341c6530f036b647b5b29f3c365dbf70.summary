-- @entity2 's internet - based messaging service , @entity1 , has long had problems when it comes to interacting with @entity6 devices			1
now the company is finally acknowledging the problems and rolling out a slate of bug fixes to make @entity2 - to - @entity11 messaging less of a nightmare			2
instead of sending regular @entity14 text messages via wireless carriers , @entity1 transfers messages across @entity2 's own servers to allow @entity19 users to message one another without paying carrier fees			1
but some people who switch from an iphone to a non-apple device have found it difficult to dissociate their phone numbers from @entity1			2
that leads to text messages from friends getting sucked up into @entity2 's database and disappearing instead of being sent along to the person 's new phone as a traditional sms message			2
users can turn off @entity1 on all their @entity2 devices to remedy the problem , but sometimes the issue persists , especially if a user does n't disable @entity1 before selling his or her old @entity19			1
one frustrated customer is suing @entity2 over the issue , claiming that @entity19 defectors are being " penalized and unable to obtain the full benefits of their wireless - service contracts			1
" the claimant is seeking class - action status for the suit			0
the growing backlash has now forced @entity2 to address the problem directly			0
" we recently fixed a server - side @entity1 bug which was causing an issue for some users , and we have an additional bug fix in a future software update , " the company told re / code in a statement thursday			0
it 's not clear when the new bug fix will be implemented			0
@entity62 has a handy guide to help ensure your texts do n't get caught in @entity1 purgatory forever .			0
