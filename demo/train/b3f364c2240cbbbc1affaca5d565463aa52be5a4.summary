-- how about a world where we have murderers but no murders ? the police still chase down criminals who commit murder , we have trials , juries who judge , and justice is handed out			0
with many forms of cybercrime and hacking , we can just decide , as a society , to take away much of the damage before it happens			0
imagine if the hackers had stolen intimate pictures from @entity20 , and we all just agreed that , " she did n't want us to see these pictures , so we 're not going to look			1
" we do n't have a right to her body			1
if you were over at @entity20 's house , and she left the room to get you a shortbread cookie and cup of decaffeinated tea ( this is my fantasy ) , you would n't take that opportunity to search for nude pictures on her computer			1
if she wanted to change her shirt before you went out to see @entity42 together ( still my fantasy ) , and she asked you to turn her back while she did that , even if you were a bit tempted to peek , you would n't			1
you 're a good person and you would respect her wishes			0
if you were visiting @entity46 , and she left the room to get			0
um , let 's say a nice fig - filled cookie and some hot chocolate , i do n't think you would open up her computer and read her company emails to see if you could find something that you could use against her			1
you just would n't do that			2
i do n't even want to know what people are saying behind my back about me , let alone about someone else			2
if you follow that same morality , if you simply think that people have a right to privacy and that you do n't want to see what people do n't want you to see , well , there would still be hacking crimes ... but the victims would suffer less			1
i 've been seriously blackmailed			2
i 've had all the information on my computer fall into the criminal hands and the criminal ask for money to not publish that information			1
yup , there were sex pictures of me and somehow my criminal thought that me naked was as valuable as @entity20 naked			1
my criminal was a f --- -- g idiot			0
there was nothing on my drive that would have really done any damage to my career			0
it really would n't have even embarrassed me that much , but i was still freaked by a bad guy looking at my stuff			2
my criminal was busted and stopped and the information never got out , but it was still yucky			2
@entity20 and @entity90 are all going to feel violated and the crime is still real , but we , as a society , can make much of the damage go away			1
we do n't need reporters to team up with the criminals to help them do the damage			2
the crime is newsworthy , but not the content			0
it is not our right to see pictures and emails that the owners did n't want us to see			1
we have no right to stolen goods			0
even if someone else stole it first , stealing is still wrong			0
we ca n't stop any damage a murder causes just by not reporting it and not looking , but we can do that with hacking			0
if someone does n't want us to see something , let 's not look			0
let 's not help criminals			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity123 .			1

@entity123 : @entity125 is a crime that is enabled when we *invade* others ' privacy
if we do n't look at nude photos of @entity20 or @entity90 emails , crime is lessened , he says
*jillette* : i 've been hacked but my information was n't made public
