-- have you ever wondered what is inside your dental plaque ? probably not			1
but this question is now being asked not only by dentists , but also by archaeologists			0
as a molecular archaeologist , i research the origins and evolution of human disease by conducting genetic research on the skeletal and mummified remains of ancient peoples			1
by extracting dna from ancient human bones , we can reconstruct the human genome at different times in the past and look for differences that might be related to adaptations , risk factors , or inherited diseases			1
the aim is to better understand the evolutionary vulnerabilities of the human body so that we can better manage and improve our health in the future			1
but this only tells us half of the story			0
many of today 's most important health challenges are not caused by simple mutations in the human genome , but result from a complex interplay between genetic variation , diet , microbes and parasites , and our own immune response			1
diseases and disorders such as periodontitis , heart disease , allergies , diabetes and irritable bowel syndrome , among others , have a strong evolutionary component directly related to the fact that we live in a very different environment than the one in which our bodies evolved			1
to better understand these diseases , we need to move past studies of the human genome alone toward a more holistic approach that takes into account human health in the past			1
but how do we do this , and , most importantly , where can we obtain this information ? skeletons are ubiquitous and preserve for long periods of time			2
of course , all of the soft tissues have decomposed			0
the skeleton alone gives us limited information			2
mummies are another option , but they are very limited in number and geographical distribution			0
in the case of @entity81 mummies , they have had all their internal organs removed			0
@entity83 , or fossilized human feces , which can be found in dry caves , can provide detailed information about diet and intestinal disease			1
but they are generally quite rare			0
@entity90 : @entity91 : how to look inside the brain to tackle this problem , i put together an international team of researchers in @entity97 , @entity98 , and @entity99 to investigate a largely ignored and little - studied type of fossilized dental plaque that has recently shown promise in microscopy studies			1
its technical name is dental calculus , but many people know it by the term , tartar			2
it is a partially mineralized accretion of bacterial gunk and food debris that build up on teeth over time			0
at an average dental cleaning you may have about 10 - 30 mg removed , but in eras before modern dentistry , as much as 600 mg could build up on the teeth over a lifetime			0
dental calculus fossilizes just like the rest of the skeleton and can persist for tens of thousands of years			0
it is abundant in eras before dental hygiene , and it is ubiquitous			0
it is found in every human population , and it is even found among @entity128 and animals			0
previously , microscopy studies had identified all sorts of things entrapped within ancient dental calculus , including plant microfossils ( pollen , starches , phytoliths and fibers ) and a diverse array of bacterial cells			2
our team is taking this research a step further to ask whether we can also recover dna and proteins that can tell us more about the health status and diets of ancient humans			1
@entity90 : @entity150 digs for humanity 's origins what we have found so far is that we can identify many bacterial species that inhabited the mouth and nasal passages , immunological proteins associated with inflammation and infection , and biomolecular indicators of foods that were consumed			0
interestingly , we have also found bacteria that inhabit the lungs and gastrointestinal tract , thereby granting us virtual access to the previously inaccessible and long decomposed respiratory and digestive systems			0
thus , the fossilized plaque can tell us about diet , immunity and pathogens not just in the mouth but throughout the body			2
@entity90 : @entity174 on regenerating our bodies by applying advanced dna sequencing and protein mass spectrometry technologies to ancient dental calculus , we can begin to reconstruct a detailed picture of the dynamic interplay between diet , infection and immunity that occurred thousands of years ago			2
this allows us to investigate the long - term evolutionary history of human health and disease , right down to the genetic code of individual pathogens , and it can teach us about how pathogens evolve and why they continue to make us sick			1
our research is ongoing , and we expect to recover even more health and dietary information as we continue to refine our methodology and investigate a broader range of ancient populations			1
as final food for thought , i urge you to think twice the next time you brush your teeth			0
your mouth is full of valuable information			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity208 .			2

@entity208 : dental plaque contains valuable information
studying genome is *n't* enough ; we need to study evolution of human diseases , she says
@entity208 : by extracting @entity218 from fossilized tartar , we learn about health of ancient humans
she says understanding our evolutionary vulnerabilities will help us improve our health
