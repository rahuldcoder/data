@entity0 -- while president @entity4 and his @entity6 counterpart @entity5 enjoy the @entity8 sunshine this week , a different kind of heat threatens @entity5 in his troublesome backyard , @entity10			1
nearly 120 @entity11 have doused themselves in gasoline and set themselves alight in protest against @entity6 occupation and repression			1
@entity16 is not the only form of protest			0
in november , students gathered in their hundreds in @entity19 ( known in @entity6 as @entity19 ) county , @entity22 province , to protest the use of @entity24 , rather than @entity11 , as the language of education			1
in april , unemployed @entity11 graduates in @entity20 , @entity28 province , protested that @entity6 immigrants were taking jobs , while last month , thousands of @entity11 converged on a pilgrimage site on @entity33 mountain to prevent a @entity6 company mining it			2
the default @entity6 response to protest is to use force			2
in its official human rights report this year , the @entity38 described repression in @entity10 as " severe , " noting abuses such as " extrajudicial killings , torture [ and ] arbitrary arrests			1
" in march , the chair of the @entity46 described @entity10 as among the world 's " most repressed and closed societies			2
" the cycle of repression and protest goes on			0
just last week @entity52 , a 31 - year - old nomad , died after setting himself on fire			0
in 2011 , the self - immolation of another young man , @entity55 in @entity56 , was said to be the catalyst for the @entity58 , an outpouring of long - repressed desire for freedom that was hailed by world leaders			1
but you will search in vain for any stirring words on @entity11 freedom from president @entity4 or other world leaders			1
@entity69 politicians perform a careful dance in relation to @entity10			2
those who elect them want them to speak out for freedom and human rights ; @entity6 , reported to hold more than one - fifth of the @entity76 ' total foreign - held debt , wants them to shut up			1
@entity78 dictates appeasement : electoral politics requires tough talk			0
the result is a mess			0
there have been countless official " expressions of concern " about the situation since the self - immolations started to spread two years ago , and we are constantly reassured that private channels are being used to apply pressure to @entity6			1
officials and junior ministers are permitted to issue calls for restraint			0
but there is a ceiling above which such statements do not go : leaders remain mute			0
president @entity4 has not publicly addressed the issue of human rights in @entity10 since taking office			1
secretary of state @entity104 has made one careful comment since his appointment , but there is no evidence he raised @entity10 during his visit to @entity6 in april			2
@entity6 recently threatened commercial consequences for the @entity111 unless prime minister @entity112 apologized for meeting the @entity113 in private last year			2
his response -- while falling short of an apology -- reassured them that the @entity111 views @entity10 as part of @entity6 , and failed to mention human rights at all			1
sinologists -- and spin doctors -- in @entity121 or the @entity111 's @entity122 may argue that @entity10 will benefit from a sensitive approach			2
late last year , however , two @entity111 government ministers who had been leaned on not to meet with the @entity113 for fear of offending @entity6 again , finally lost patience with that view , writing that " where @entity10 is concerned , the @entity6 government does not respond positively to any conciliatory gesture ... but instead interprets this as a sign of weakness and so makes further demands for concessions			2
" what goes for @entity0 goes for @entity121 -- and @entity137 , @entity138 and @entity139 for that matter			0
western policy on @entity10 is pleasing no one -- not @entity6 , not the electorates , and certainly not @entity11			1
@entity6 's economic engine is slowing , and @entity146 is acutely conscious that without growth , its 1.3 billion people will be far less tolerant of continued dictatorship			0
between 250 to 500 public protests are already estimated to take place every day in @entity6 -- foreign trade and investment will dry up if @entity6 starts to look like an unstable place to do business			0
reform is in @entity6 's interests			0
@entity6 also seeks legitimacy as a full member of the world community and is undoubtedly sensitive to criticism on human rights			1
this year , it seeks election to the @entity165 's @entity164 ( @entity164 )			0
while economic muscle helps it win nations ' votes for the @entity164 election , it still needs to offer its potential voters some tokens of sincerity			0
more tellingly , @entity6 actually accepted 42 out of 99 recommendations to improve its performance on human rights following its last full human rights review by the @entity165 in 2009			1
in choosing not simply to reject that kind of external assessment , @entity6 has also accepted the need to demonstrate progress			2
it faces another such review this year			0
@entity146 has not gone soft , however			0
it will not choose to show progress on @entity10 , unless it is called to account for @entity10			0
no one expects president @entity4 to embarrass his guest this weekend with tasteless honesty or @entity58 - style rhetoric on @entity10			1
but bringing @entity10 to the table will show @entity6 and the @entity76 people he represents that he recognizes the old model has failed			1
@entity6 , the @entity76 and @entity10 all stand to benefit from that			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity194 .			0

@entity194 : @entity4 should raise issue of @entity10 during meeting with @entity5
she says world leaders have been silent , despite wave of @entity11 self - immolations
@entity6 has accepted the need to improve its human rights performance , she says
" @entity6 , the @entity76 and @entity10 all stand to benefit " from addressing the issue , she says
