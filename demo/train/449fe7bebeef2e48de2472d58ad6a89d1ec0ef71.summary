-- @entity1 says a new report by the @entity3 that points to a spike in violence in @entity6 differs from the alliance 's tally because " security incidents " were defined differently			1
" the @entity3 counts a number of additional event types that @entity12 does not include in its definition of security incidents , such as cache finds , arrests , assassinations , intimidation , and others , " according to a statement thursday from the @entity1 - led @entity12			2
it says " 25 % of the total @entity3 security incidents are event types that @entity12 does not include in its definition			1
" another difference , @entity12 says , is that @entity3 figures include " all incidents regardless of which entity initiates the activity , " while @entity1 counted only " attacks initiated by insurgent elements			1
" but the international force also said it recognizes that the country 's eastern regions remain a " challenging security situation			0
" enemy - initiated attacks in june , july and august were 17 % higher than the same period in 2010 , according to the @entity12 statement			0
the @entity3 report , from the office of @entity38 ban ki - moon , says security incidents in 2011 are up 39 % over the same period last year			1
most of the incidents involved armed clashes and improvised explosive devices			0
there were just as many suicide attacks -- 12 per month -- as there were a year ago , the report says			0
" the south and southeast of the country , particularly around the city of @entity52 , continued to be the focus of military activity and accounted for approximately two - thirds of total security incidents , " the report says			2
but a rash of recent high - profile attacks and assassinations have raised questions about the country 's overall level of security , particularly as coalition forces are drawn down .			0

@entity12 says 25 % of the total @entity3 security incidents are not on its list
@entity3 figures include " all incidents regardless of which entity initiates the activity , " @entity12 says
@entity12 says @entity6 's east remains a security challenge
the @entity3 report says monthly security incidents are up 39 % in 2011
