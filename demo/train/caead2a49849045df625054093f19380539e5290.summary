-- it is possible more @entity3 troops could be added in @entity4 if the new @entity3 commander there needs them , but defense secretary @entity7 said he does not expect a significant increase			1
@entity3 @entity9 sweep for bombs in @entity4 this week			1
during a visit to troops at @entity13 , @entity14 , on thursday , @entity7 said he is waiting to hear what gen. @entity15 recommends after he completes a review of operations in @entity4			1
@entity15 is expected to complete a classified report for @entity7 by the end of this month , assessing where the war stands , and what needs to be done			2
he will tell @entity24 whether he needs more @entity3 troops to fight the escalating conflict , according to a senior @entity3 military official			2
gates asked @entity15 to " state his requirements for resources , " said the official -- who did not want to be identified because the report is not completed			0
the review is also expected to recommend that the number of @entity4 troops be increased beyond the goal of 134,000 , other military sources said			0
during a speech and question - and - answer session with troops at @entity13 , @entity7 acknowledged he would consider a recommendation to boost @entity3 troops beyond the level of 68,000 already approved			1
" we 'll see what gen. @entity15 recommends , " he said			1
" but i think there will not be a significant increase in troop levels in @entity4 beyond the 68,000 , at least probably through the end of the year			0
maybe some increase , but not a lot			0
" @entity7 has made clear in the past he is reluctant to approve additional major increases in troop levels , preferring to keep the @entity3 at a lower profile in the nation			1
about 57,000 @entity3 troops are in @entity4 , with the other 11,000 to arrive by the end of this year			2
@entity7 has said he wants to see if that level of troops would be sufficient			0
@entity7 ' press secretary , @entity55 , told @entity0 the @entity13 comments " are not necessarily a foreshadowing of what 's to come			0
" he said @entity7 " does n't want to impose an artificial troop cap on the commander , " but does want to see if the strategy can be carried out with the approved troop levels .			0

defense secretary would consider it if @entity3 commander says he needs more
gen. @entity15 preparing review of operation for @entity24
still , @entity7 said , any amount over 68,000 approved would not be much
wants low @entity3 profile in @entity4 , *chance* to see if 68,000 is enough
