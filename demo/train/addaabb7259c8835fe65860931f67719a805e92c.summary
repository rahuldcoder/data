-- in the playgrounds across @entity3 they will be re-enacting this night for years to come			1
each child will take it in turns to take on the role of @entity9 , another will pretend to follow in the footsteps of @entity11 , while others will fight it out to pull on the imaginary shirt of @entity15			0
it is nights like these which inspire not only those inside the stadium , but the next generation of footballers			0
it 's what makes the intangible , tangible			0
trailing 2 - 1 to @entity27 going into stoppage time in tuesday 's @entity30 quarterfinal second leg , the @entity3 dream lay in tatters			1
this youthful and vibrant side , a team which has won admirers from across the globe , appeared to have choked when it was supposed to underline its status as one of the most exciting sides in @entity39			2
but this is football -- a sport which still boasts the capacity to leave even the most seasoned of spectators transfixed in a state of disbelief			0
with the clock ticking down and all hope abating , @entity3 produced one of the most astonishing @entity48 comebacks in recent years			1
two goals in added time broke @entity52 hearts and propelled @entity54 's side into the semifinals in a manner befitting of its own film script			1
the @entity61 side , which had held @entity27 to a goalless draw in the first leg , was expected to reach the semifinal with ease and qualify for the last four for the first time since 1998			1
it was not difficult to see why @entity3 was considered such a strong favourite -- it plays a brand of football which reawakens the youthful spirit in even the most weary of souls			1
in its yellow and black shirts , the players buzz and swarm around like bees , pushing , pressing and pestering			0
but while @entity3 dominated , it failed to make that crucial incision			1
instead , it was @entity27 which made the first move , giving the game a twist most did not expect to witness			1
@entity83 's fierce strike found the corner and temporarily silenced the raucous crowd packed inside the stadium			0
but that goal , which arrived after 25 minutes , only served to stir @entity3 into action			1
suddenly @entity3 found its spark -- and what a spark			1
in the end it was a moment of magic which lit up the @entity3 sky as the home side drew level with a sublime demonstration of how to unlock a defense			1
this was not simply a " goal "			0
no , this was a thing of sheer beauty from the moment the ball found its way to @entity11 until it hit the back of the net ; this was football from a different planet			0
@entity11 , the precociously talented playmaker , unfurled a flick of such cunning that it split the @entity27 defense and allowed @entity15 to clip the ball over the goalkeeper and fire home			2
if @entity119 had scored a goal of similar fashion then the world would have stopped and applauded -- @entity3 are not there yet , but this team is showing a potential which should excite those who embrace such pure football			1
but while its attacking prowess was clear to see , the backdoor always appeared ajar for a @entity27 side determined to make light of its financial troubles and secure a last four berth			1
@entity83 twice failed to scored with headers when well placed , but those misses appeared not to matter when @entity134 touched home @entity136 's shot with eight minutes remaining			2
that goal , which was converted from an offside position , left the home supporters crushed			0
but @entity3 refused to be denied and with the game drifting into the 91st minute , @entity11 lashed home from close range to level the game at 2 - 2 and leave his side needing one more goal			1
with just a couple of minutes left to play , @entity27 needed only to hold out and preserve the 2 - 2 scoreline to progress			1
but as the yellow and black shirts poured forward , the @entity27 defense buckled			2
from a seemingly hopeless position , the ball was lumped into the penalty area before falling at the feet of @entity9 just a yard from goal			0
he was offside -- earlier in the move there were four @entity3 players offside -- but that did n't stop him			2
the @entity166 smashed the ball home , the assistant referee 's flag did n't go up , the referee did n't blow			0
the goal stood as @entity27 fell			2
" there is one very disappointed team in this moment and one lucky team , " @entity54 told @entity171			0
it was our worst game in the @entity30 this season and not our best football			0
" if we play like tonight we wo n't win the @entity30 , but we have reached our target of the semifinal			2
" @entity27 , which was making its debut in the competition , was left shell shocked as it suffered a heartbreaking exit			2
" we were four minutes away from the semis , " striker @entity187 told @entity171			2
" there is huge disappointment in the dressing room			0
we had the tie in our hands			0
" in the night 's other game , @entity194 progressed to the final four , despite suffering a 3 - 2 defeat in @entity197 against @entity198			1
leading 3 - 0 from the first leg , @entity200 's early strike appeared to kill off any hope the home side might have had of causing an upset			1
but @entity206 's men produced an inspired performance with goals from @entity209 , @entity210 and @entity211 firing it into a 3 - 1 lead on the night			1
@entity200 grabbed a late second , his 48th goal in 47 games this season , to finally end the fightback			1
real finished with 10 - men after @entity220 was sent off			2
" i was n't getting nervous because i have no time for it , " @entity194 boss @entity221 told @entity171			1
" i am on the bench so i have no time to think or to feel it , they are strong , strong mentally			2
" they do n't play against 11 , they play 50,000 against 11 and it was hard for us			0
" we are there , in the semifinals and that is what that matters			0
" today is the kind of match where you have everything to lose and nothing to win			0
" people think we are already in the semifinal and players that that feeling from the outside			0
i felt the team was ready to work hard and had the motivation to reach @entity246 in the final			0
" i do n't know who we will play in the semifinal , it will be against a great team , that 's for sure and we need to play the semifinal and enjoy it			0
