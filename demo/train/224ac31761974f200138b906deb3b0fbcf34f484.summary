-- former @entity2 mayor @entity1 , delivering thursday 's commencement speech at @entity4 , criticized what he described as a disturbing trend of liberals silencing voices " deemed politically objectionable			1
" " this spring , it has been disturbing to see a number of college commencement speakers withdraw -- or have their invitations rescinded -- after protests from students and -- to me , shockingly -- from senior faculty and administrators who should know better , " @entity1 said			1
the billionaire former mayor cited an october speech during which his ex-police commissioner , @entity20 , was shouted down by students at @entity21			1
the university canceled @entity20 's speech when protesters opposed to the police department 's stop - and - frisk policy shouted down and interrupted @entity20			2
@entity1 noted other universities have had speakers back out			1
he pointed to @entity29 , where former @entity31 secretary of state @entity30 withdrew amid protests , and @entity33 , where @entity35 chief @entity34 withdrew after a student petition			2
" in each case , liberals silenced a voice -- and denied an honorary degree -- to individuals they deemed politically objectionable			1
this is an outrage , " @entity1 said to applause			1
an even more glaring example of failing to listen to the opposing side , @entity1 said , was the longstanding impasse between @entity47 and @entity48 in @entity49 , where every major question facing the nation is decided " not by engaging with one another but by trying to shout each other down			1
" @entity1 , who in april pledged $ 50 million to gun control groups he helped organize , spoke about @entity49 politicians ' handling of gun issues , noting @entity58 has barred the national @entity59 from conducting studies of gun violence , a prohibition that was recently extended to the @entity63			1
" what are they afraid of ? " he asked			2
the @entity66 this year delayed a vote on president @entity69 's nominee for surgeon general , dr. @entity68 , because the @entity4 physician " had the audacity to say gun violence is a public health crisis that should be tackled , " @entity1 said to applause			1
" let 's get serious : when 85 americans are killed with guns every single day , and shootings regularly occur at our schools and universities , including last week 's tragedy at @entity84 , it would be almost medical malpractice to say anything else , " @entity1 said			1
the former mayor , who received honorary degrees from @entity4 along with seven others -- including former president @entity90 and music icon @entity91 -- spoke of the role of universities as places where people of all backgrounds and beliefs can freely debate ideas without that " sacred trust " being threatened by the " tyrannical tendencies of monarchs , mobs and majorities			1
" he recalled when protesters came out several years ago against the development of a mosque a few blocks from ground zero in lower @entity108			2
" we protected their right to protest , " @entity1 said			1
" but they could not have been more wrong			0
and we refused to cave in to their demands			0
the idea that government would single out a particular religion , and block its believers -- and only its believers -- from building a house of worship in a particular area is diametrically opposed to the moral principles that gave rise to our great nation , and the constitutional protections that have sustained it			0
" he added , " if you want the freedom to worship as you wish , to speak as you wish , and to marry whom you wish , you must tolerate my freedom to do so -- or not do so -- too			0
what i do may offend you			0
you may find my actions immoral or unjust			0
but attempting to restrict my freedoms in ways that you would not restrict your own leads only to injustice			0
" @entity140 compared the intolerance of ideas prevalent in the country today to " @entity145 's @entity144 " in the 1950s and its destruction of thousands of lives			2
in the 2012 presidential race , he said , the overwhelming majority of campaign contributions from @entity152 faculty went to @entity69			0
" today , on many college campuses , it is liberals trying to repress conservative ideas , even as conservative faculty members are at risk of becoming an endangered species , " he said			1
after the speech , @entity162 , who completed her master 's degree in education , said @entity1 was bold to criticize universities as too liberal			1
" i thought it was really thoughtful , " she said of the speech			0
" it was nice that it was n't just platitudes			0
" @entity172 graduate @entity171 said the speech was " a great message ... about tolerance of different ideas and diversity of opinions			2
" @entity179 , an engineering school graduate , said he welcomed the former mayor 's viewpoint			2
" he gave some interesting perspectives on conservative views in universities that i had n't heard before coming from a liberal undergraduate institution myself , " he said			0
" it was eye - opening for a lot of people			0
" before the speech , @entity191 , president of the @entity192 , questioned why @entity140 was selected as speaker , because , she said , the @entity198 's stop - and - frisk program " disproportionately has targeted people of color in @entity2			0
" " it 's basically racial profiling , " junior @entity199 said of the @entity2 policing policy under @entity140			0
" and so it 's unsettling to me , ( for ) someone to speak who advocates a racist policy when you want students of color on campus to feel comfortable			0
it 's confusing and i do n't think its what @entity4 stands for			1
" @entity0 's @entity213 and @entity214 contributed to this report .			0
