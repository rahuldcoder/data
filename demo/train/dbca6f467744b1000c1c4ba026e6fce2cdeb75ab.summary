-- thirty - two years ago , president @entity1 launched an era of anti-government politics with his first inaugural address			1
on monday , president @entity5 offered the best rebuttal to date			2
conservative columnist @entity7 said the speech marked " the end of @entity11 , " and i could n't agree more			0
like @entity1 , the president sought to ground the national conversation in his own definition of patriotism			1
but instead of the " liberty - only " patriotism of @entity1 and political descendants such as @entity18 , who would turn love of country into hate for its government and its people , @entity5 offered a deeper " liberty and justice for all " patriotism			1
@entity5 noted that the world has changed -- that global problems cause local disasters , and what happens across town affects you and your neighbors -- and he called on us all to realize that you can not have liberty for all without justice for all			1
opinion : world to @entity5 -- you ca n't ignore us perhaps most fittingly , on a day heavy with memory , the president invoked those who once stood on the @entity45 to hear a different type of founding father -- " a king ( who proclaimed ) that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on @entity52			2
" the overtones of @entity1 's 1981 speech rang so loudly , in fact , that it 's clear the president and his team looked to that address as inspiration			1
@entity1 offered up a vision of an over-taxed , long - neglected " @entity62 " ; @entity5 's version of " @entity62 " is youthful , diverse , energetic and engaged			1
both saw their addresses as a call to arms for all @entity67			0
both sought to tie the best traditions of our founding fathers to today 's challenges			0
both insisted that what truly drives @entity67 is the ingenuity and independence of our people			0
opinion : @entity5 finally meets @entity79 but while @entity1 advanced the simplistic idea that government and liberty are always at odds , @entity5 's speech reflected the realizations of a new century			1
instead of " government is the problem , " the president reminded us that we could all fall victim to sudden misfortune			0
instead of pinning blame for every social problem on the size of government , the president recognized both individual responsibility and the role of community in giving each child the opportunity to succeed			0
like @entity1 , the president invoked the names of famous places in @entity67 history -- but instead of battles , he tied @entity107 in with @entity108 and cemented his declaration that lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender rights are civil rights			1
coming off an election during which today 's @entity116 insulted a nation of " takers , " the president declared that @entity121 , @entity122 and @entity123 " free us to take the risks that make this country great			2
" opinion : @entity5 's ringing defense of liberalism this was not a partisan speech			1
it was not a campaign rally			0
but it showed that @entity5 will not back away from a fight			2
he is staking a bet that a rising generation has a new vision for the country			0
i do not think that following through will be easy , or that the president will do everything right			0
but he showed monday that he is standing on the right side of history			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity144 .			0

@entity1 et al . tried to turn love of country into hate for government , he says
@entity144 : @entity5 offers " liberty and justice for all " patriotism
