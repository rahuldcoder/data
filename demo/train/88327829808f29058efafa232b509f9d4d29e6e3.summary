-- @entity1 and @entity2 never met before today , but they have an odd and very significant thing in common : both of them were inoculated against polio by one of their parents			1
in the case of @entity13 , of course , it was his father @entity14 , who administered his just - developed vaccine to himself , his lab workers and his family even before it was formally approved and released			0
@entity19 's inoculator was her mother , the late @entity22 prime minister @entity20 , assassinated in 2007			1
" i have a picture of my wife immunizing our daughter 18 years ago , " said @entity23 , the current president and @entity25 's father , at a @entity26 gathering saturday			1
" my martyred wife told the world she dreamt of a world in which all children are free of disease			2
" father , daughter and @entity1 had come to the @entity26 as part of a new international push to eradicate polio once and for all , and they were hardly alone			1
also in attendance were @entity26 secretary general ban ki - moon ; @entity44 president @entity43 ; @entity46 president @entity45 ; @entity48 prime minister @entity47 ; @entity49 secretary of health and human services @entity50 ; and -- significantly -- @entity52 , head of the @entity53			1
all of them and others addressed a plenary session of the @entity26 's @entity57 , and all of them had a single promise : by 2015 , if not earlier , polio would join smallpox as the only diseases in human history to be finally and fully snuffed out in the wild			1
@entity0 : @entity67 's back			0
why now ? there was an odd - seeming disconnect between the financial and institutional firepower assembled saturday and the actual , lingering incidence of polio			2
in 1952 , three years before the @entity13 vaccine was introduced , 52,000 children were paralyzed or killed in the @entity49 alone			0
in 1988 , polio was endemic in more than 120 countries , still afflicting an average of 350,000 people -- mostly children -- per year			1
today , the disease is endemic in just three countries -- @entity22 , @entity44 and @entity46 -- and only in isolated pockets at that , an improvement due in no small part to the efforts of @entity88 , whose 34,000 chapters worldwide have spent more than $ 1.2 billion in the past 24 years to wipe out the disease			1
so far in 2012 , there have been just 88 reported cases , and @entity94 , which once had a higher incidence than any country in the world , just celebrated a full polio - free year			0
in epidemiological terms , that ought to be enough to declare victory -- especially in a world in which 34 million people are infected with @entity103 and a staggering 225 million have malaria			2
but numbers can be dangerously misleading , and this is especially the case with polio			0
for one thing , only about 1 of 200 polio infections actually produce disease symptoms			2
the other 199 are subclinical , which means patients may have no idea they 're infected , even though they can still pass on the virus -- and it 's one that 's exceedingly easy to pass , especially in the developing world where poor sanitation accelerates transmission			0
why polio has n't gone away yet in 2003 , polio was on the brink of extinction just as it is today , until clerics in northern @entity46 banned the vaccine claiming that it was part of a plot to infect @entity46 youth with @entity103			1
by 2005 , polio cases -- nearly all of them the @entity46 strain -- were raging across 16 countries , from @entity133 through @entity94 and into @entity134			1
" as long as the polio virus survives , " said @entity50 in her @entity26 remarks , " there 's a risk of resurgence			1
" ensuring that it does n't survive was the announced mission of the gathering , and that mission is being prosecuted in a lot of ways -- starting with money			2
@entity52 has committed more than $ 1 billion to polio vaccination efforts so far and is keeping the funding spigot open as long as necessary			2
rotary chairman @entity149 announced another $ 75 million to add to the group 's already huge contribution ; @entity48 pledged another $ 50 million			1
perhaps most important , the @entity152 has now stepped into the game , pledging $ 227 million to @entity22 to help close an existing funding gap until the virus is at last eradicated			1
@entity0 : how a ban on polio puts the entire world at risk it 's @entity22 that is currently ground zero in the polio war , not because it has the greatest number of remaining cases -- though it does -- but because the anti-polio effort has recently been politicized , just as it was in @entity46 nine years ago			1
in june , the @entity166 blocked a planned round of vaccinations for 161,000 children , demanding that @entity49 drone strikes in the country be halted first			0
@entity173 vaccinators have also been newly suspect , ever since the @entity176 newspaper the @entity174 revealed that @entity178 operatives involved in the killing of @entity180 used a faux vaccine campaign in @entity22 to obtain dna from suspected @entity180 family members , in order to determine if he was in the country at all			2
in july , gunmen attacked polio teams administering vaccines after the prohibition was lifted , critically wounding a @entity191 doctor			0
that tragedy hung over the @entity26 proceedings			2
@entity166 's vaccine ban may affect 280,000 children " this is a matter of health and justice , " @entity196 said in his prepared remarks			0
" where there is fighting and insecurity , i appeal to all parties to provide safe access to health workers			0
" @entity2 announced that government forces are mobilizing community leaders " to understand that the polio vaccine is a blessing			0
" @entity52 's remarks were less about geopolitics than about common sense -- fiscal and otherwise			0
in a conversation with @entity216 last week , he described a vaccination program that costs even $ 1 billion per year as " a heck of a bargain " since it avoids tens of billions of dollars in downstream treatment costs -- to say nothing of human suffering			2
" i 'm very focused on impact per dollar , " he said at the @entity26 " this is one of the smartest allocations of resources the world can make			2
" @entity0 : the @entity166 halts the polio vaccine -- and @entity22 's kids will pay to help the world make that investment well , he is employing satellite mapping tools to target more precisely where in often off - the - grid places vaccination teams must go			1
he is also arranging to equip vaccine crates with gps tracking systems to ensure that vaccines do n't wind up lost , discarded or on the black market			0
ultimately , he 'd like to see the techniques and infrastructure that are built to eradicate polio today put to work against malaria , measles , @entity103 , cholera and similar global scourges tomorrow			1
" we want to leave in place a primary health care system that can be used for other diseases , " he said			0
gates sounded confident that polio could indeed be beaten and in relatively short order -- within just two or three years ; @entity45 pledged that in @entity46 at least the disease would be finished by 2015 , when his term in office expires ; and @entity258 , the @entity176 's minister of state for international development -- representing the world 's second largest donor country after the @entity49 -- delivered an open scolding to developed nations that have yet to get off their wallets and help pay for the eradication effort			1
" we need to understand why some countries are reluctant to contribute , " he said with pointed emphasis			0
" @entity94 has shown the world what is possible			0
other countries have got to learn from that excellent example			0
" @entity180 raid harms @entity22 polio fight for all the new emphasis and fresh blood being brought to the anti-polio fight , it was the seniors in the crowd who spoke with the most poignancy			1
@entity50 recalled being a small child during that viral summer of 1952 when so many of her peers were claimed , and then , in 1955 , becoming part of what was known as the @entity288 -- the first schoolchildren to step forward and receive the new vaccine			0
in the waiting area before the event began , an elderly polio survivor moving with the aid of two walking sticks approached @entity1 to thank him for the work his father had done -- even if it came too late to spare him the disease			1
in a pre-vaccine world , there was no one to blame for that victim 's long - ago infection			0
but in ways big and small , we 'll all be to blame for any infections to come			0
@entity307 : closing in on polio this story was originally published on @entity0			0
at the @entity26 , a vow to eradicate polio by 2015			1
