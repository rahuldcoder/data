" a day later , he amplified the controversy by equating a botched military operation in @entity16 with abortion			0
the @entity16 massacre claimed the lives of 34 @entity20 in southeastern @entity11 when faulty intelligence led to an airstrike on a group of smugglers crossing the @entity11 - @entity26 border			2
after @entity7 's comment , @entity11 health minister @entity27 issued a statement indicating that he would be submitting a proposal to lawmakers in the upcoming month , raising fears that the ruling @entity33 , or @entity33 , was preparing to introduce legislation to curb , if not fully block , access to abortion			1
forced abortion sparks outrage in @entity38 the protesters who convened sunday marched to @entity1 's busy @entity40 , carrying signs that read " @entity33 : get your hands off my body , " " murder is outlawing abortion , " and " abortion is a right			1
" many protesters believe that @entity7 is playing to his base of culturally conservative voters , a strategy in line with his views as a pious muslim as well as one that protestors see as an attempt to divert attention from the operation in @entity16			1
" the prime minster is conservative			0
he does have @entity70 sensibilities as well as his party , obviously , so he is trying to impose his understanding of faith and what @entity75 demands and so on to the rest of the population , " said @entity64 , an opposition party @entity66 attending sunday 's march			0
" but at the same time i also feel that this is a cover - up for the @entity16 massacre			0
" abortion up until the 10th week of pregnancy was legalized in @entity11 in 1983 and has rarely , if ever , inspired much public debate in the three decades since			1
public support today also seems to remain high , with a poll commissioned by @entity11 newspaper @entity87 indicating that 55.5 % of @entity11 do not support a ban on abortion			1
