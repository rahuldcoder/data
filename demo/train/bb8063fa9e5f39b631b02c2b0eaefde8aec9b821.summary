-- the @entity1 are in the books , and in typical fashion , there were some notable moments			1
these five were among the best : 1			0
@entity7 and their dancin ' friends perform " @entity10			1
" the recorded version of " @entity10 " -- which went on to win record of the year -- already featured @entity14 's vocals and @entity16 ' distinctive guitar			1
but the @entity18 ' added attraction was @entity19 , who dominated the awards in the mid- ' 70s ( he has three album of the year honors )			1
wonder can still bring out the best in his collaborators -- including the robot - headed @entity7 , who played from the " control room " of the recording studio set and moved like , well , robots			1
still , the group would make for a great tour			0
old royalty , new royalty the @entity35 ' @entity34 and @entity36 were in the audience and earned frequent shout outs from such presenters as host @entity40 , @entity42 and @entity43			1
( you 'd think there was some kind of @entity35 ' anniversary coming up			2
) but there was also plenty of deference to @entity51 and @entity52			0
the pair led off the show with a rousing version of " @entity56 , " and @entity51 later won a @entity18 for rap / sung collaboration			1
@entity51 mentioned his child - in - waiting , @entity59 , in his acceptance speech			0
stars rock all - white ensembles 3			0
@entity64 performances , as usual the @entity18 always try hard to match known names with rising stars , and this year , the pairings paid off with several performances			1
there was the @entity7 melange , of course , but also the combination of @entity73 and @entity74 ( with an electric " radioactive " ) and the duet of classical pianist @entity77 and metal stars @entity78			2
@entity81 , @entity80 tell us how they really feel 4			0
the new faces did well early on , it looked like it was going to be a huge night for @entity86 -- especially after they won three of the rap categories over competition that included @entity51 and @entity91			0
the duo also won best new artist			0
later in the show , it was @entity96 who shined , picking up song of the year for " @entity99			2
" the 17 - year - old @entity100 seemed particularly taken aback by her win , letting co-writer @entity103 give his speech first			0
grammys 2014 : @entity14 's hat gets life -- and @entity108 -- of its own 5			1
@entity14 's hat what can be said about the chapeau that launched at least four @entity108 accounts with a combined 10,000 - plus followers ? it looked like something @entity114 might wear			1
either way , it became a source of fun for @entity18 watchers throughout the evening			2
watch out : given the way things work these days , it could get a show of its own by march			0
the winners list : did you pick ' em ? relive the show on @entity0 's blog			2
