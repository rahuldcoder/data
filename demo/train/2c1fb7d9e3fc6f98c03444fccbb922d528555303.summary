-- @entity2 's @entity1 scored an early boost over his three @entity5 world - championship rivals on friday as he set the fastest time in practice ahead of sunday 's @entity7			1
@entity1 's lap time of one minute 40.888 seconds put him clear of @entity9 duo @entity8 and @entity10 , who finished second and fourth respectively , with @entity11 -- the favorite to take the 2010 crown at the season - ending race -- third fastest			1
who needs to do what to win the @entity5 drivers ' title two - time champion @entity11 , 29 , is the only one of the four who can seal the title at the @entity21 with a top - two finish regardless of where the others finish , with each of the remaining drivers needing results to go their way for victory			1
@entity1 still holds a slim hope of winning his second championship ; he is currently fourth in the standings , 24 points behind leader @entity11 , with 25 points on offer for the winner of the season 's final race			1
@entity5 standings after @entity41 @entity7 the 25 - year - old had to battle with his @entity44 counterpart as they traded fast laps , but it was the 2008 champion who eventually got the better of the @entity49			2
" the car feels good , so i 'm hopeful for a good qualifying result tomorrow ( saturday ) afternoon , " said @entity1 in a @entity2 statement			2
" of course , it will be tough , because the @entity54 tend to pull out half a second in the third round of qualifying , but our pace is closer to theirs than it 's ever been			0
" of all the weekends this year , this time i feel like we really do have the right package to challenge the fastest cars			0
i think we can fight for the front row			0
" the first practice session was dogged by unexpected rain on the track until the skies cleared and the driver 's enjoyed a disruption - free second session			0
@entity10 was almost half a second slower than the @entity72 pacesetter and knows he will need to improve over the course of the weekend if he is to win his first title			0
a repeat of the @entity77 's fourth place in practice will require @entity11 to finish ninth or lower in race for him to triumph			1
it was a decent start to the weekend for 23 - year - old @entity8 , who will more than likely need maximum points from @entity83 to avoid the disappointment of finishing runner up for the second season running .			0
