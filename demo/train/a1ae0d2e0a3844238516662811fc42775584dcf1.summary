-- a humanitarian watchdog group on wednesday raised concerns over the @entity5 military 's handling of juvenile detainees in @entity7 , saying " some children have been detained for more than a year without charge or trial			1
" @entity5 soldiers count juvenile detainees after a restroom break at @entity13 in @entity7 in september 2007			1
@entity14 alleges that children in @entity5 custody in @entity7 are being " held without due process			1
" the @entity19 - based group called on the military to release children detained for more than a year and to provide child detainees timely judicial reviews and " prompt access to independent legal assistance and family visits			1
" " in conflicts where it was not directly involved , the @entity5 has been a leader in helping child soldiers re-enter society , " @entity27 , a children 's rights researcher on the @entity28 at @entity14 , is quoted in the report			1
" that kind of leadership is unfortunately missing in @entity7			0
" @entity27 said , " the vast majority of children detained in @entity7 languish for months in @entity5 military custody			1
the @entity5 should provide these children with immediate access to lawyers and an independent judicial review of their detention			1
" a @entity46 spokesman for detainee operations defended the practices of the @entity5 - led coalition and denied aspects of the report			1
in several instances , maj. @entity52 said that @entity14 is calling upon coalition forces " to do something that is already a matter of practice in @entity7			2
" however , he concurred with the report 's statement that the " arrest and detention of a child must be used only as a measure of last resort and for the shortest appropriate period of time			0
" " we could not agree more , " @entity52 said			0
" detention is a last resort , and it is carried out judiciously			0
" insurgents reportedly have used some children to conduct attacks in @entity7			0
the @entity14 paper said @entity5 military authorities were detaining 513 @entity7 children as " imperative threats to security " as of may 12 , and has detained around 2,400 children in @entity7 since 2003 -- some as young as 10			1
@entity52 estimated the youngest detainees now are eight children who all are believed to be around age 13			2
" although specific age determinations are impossible , the remainder of the juvenile population ranges from 14 through 17 , " he added			0
@entity52 also said the number of juvenile detainees is fewer than 500 at the moment , down from nearly 1,000 in summer 2007			2
most child detainees are held at the @entity13 detention facility in @entity89 , where a 17 - year - old boy was strangled to death by another child detainee , the report said			2
others are detained at @entity94 near the southern city of @entity96 , @entity14 said			2
as of february , the paper said , " the reported average length of detention for children was more than 130 days , and some children have been detained for more than a year without charge or trial , in violation of the @entity106 memorandum on criminal procedures			0
" @entity14 noted the memo on the security detainee process says " any person under the age of 18 interned at any time shall in all cases be released not later than 12 months after the initial date of internment			2
" @entity52 characterized the call for the release of children who have been detained for more than a year a " hollow demand based on an inaccurate claim			0
" " there are no juveniles in coalition force custody who have been detained for more than a year , " he said			0
" all juveniles are required to be released within one year ; the majority are released in fewer than six months			0
" the report also listed other " due process " concerns : the military might interrogate child detainees for days or weeks before transferring them to main detention facilities , and " they have no real opportunity to challenge their detention			1
" military advocates assigned by the @entity5 to each child at a mandatory six - month detention review have " no training in juvenile justice or child development			1
" @entity5 officials allegedly said that " children are not provided with lawyers and do not attend the one - week or one - month detention reviews after their transfer to @entity13			1
" the children have " limited contact " with their families			2
@entity52 said that juvenile detainees do have access to family visitation , including those held in @entity89 , " in part to make them more accessible to families and service providers			1
" he also said those charged under @entity7 law do have access to legal counsel , but " those who are not referred to the @entity7 criminal courts do not have legal counsel because they are not charged with a crime			1
" all detainees ' cases are reviewed by independent attorneys within seven days of internment , @entity52 said			0
" those referred to the @entity173 are reviewed in accordance with @entity7 law			2
those not referred to @entity173 are reviewed in accordance with international humanitarian law , " he added			2
@entity14 also criticized the @entity5 military for sending 200 to 300 of the 513 child detainees to @entity180 , or @entity181			1
the juvenile detainee education facility was opened at @entity13 in august 2007 with the " stated intention to provide 600 detainees , ranging in age from 11 to 17 , with educational services pending release or transfer to @entity7 custody			2
" @entity52 said juveniles " are given access to some of the highest quality schooling available in @entity7 " at @entity180			0
the report said an " unknown number " of youths have been transferred to @entity7 custody , and it made reference to a @entity195 in @entity7 report that said children under @entity7 custody " are at risk of physical abuse			1
" " like adults , children transferred to @entity7 custody are at risk of abuse and poor conditions of confinement			0
a @entity5 military official in @entity89 told @entity14 this month that the @entity5 was delaying the transfer of 130 child detainees to @entity7 's @entity212 juvenile detention facility because of conditions there , " the report said			1
@entity52 said the coalition has refrained from " transferring physical custody of children to @entity7 authorities pending trial when there is reason to believe they will be at risk of abuse " and that the military does separate juveniles from the greater population			1
" those with special needs such as the mentally infirm are provided medical care and placed in separate housing where appropriate for their individual case , " he said			0
