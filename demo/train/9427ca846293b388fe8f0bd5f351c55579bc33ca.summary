-- away from the manicured glamor of the @entity3 , there 's another @entity4 -- a @entity4 that lies beneath			1
beneath the red carpet of the @entity7 in the basement , that is			0
it 's a seething , throbbing film market alive with b - movies -- low - budget features with no big name actors attached -- often horrors , thrillers , erotic movies or " mockbusters " ( more on those later )			1
this is the @entity20 ... @entity22 's just cannes for the a-listers -- this is @entity25 ... it 's a galaxy away from the movie screenings of the @entity28 -- the elite group of films chosen by the festival 's selection committee from the thousands submitted each year -- of which just 18 go into competition for the feted top prize , the @entity37			1
they mostly look like this ... or like this ... so if you find yourself not among those with @entity43 on speed dial and if your budget is a few zeros short of a few million , then head to the @entity47 you must , to make or break your fortune			0
although it 's in fact one of the biggest film markets in the world , in reality it 's just a sprawling global bazaar , where filmmakers and distributors come and set up stalls and negotiate			1
but instead of selling electronics or questionably - sourced handbags , they sell movies			1
lots and lots of movies			2
films like this ... and this ... in 2013 alone , producers , distributors , financiers , video - on - demand providers and other representatives from more than 1000 companies in 108 countries ( including places as far - flung as @entity75 and @entity76 ) came together to haggle over 5,364 films , according to official figures			2
so , how does an ambitious filmmaker get noticed in this mass of movies ? we asked a couple of @entity4 veterans and a young @entity86 man who made a splash at @entity4 a couple of years ago with a zombie movie called " @entity90 " that he made for $ 70			1
@entity91 some controversy ... @entity92 have announced that they are making a thriller based on the disappearance of @entity96 flight mh370			0
the film 's promotional pamphlet says that it " tells the story of five people who seek revenge for the death of their loved ones			1
they hijack a plane ... " @entity106 denies that the timing of the movie could be considered offensive of the families of the 239 men , women and children aboard the airliner that disappeared on march 8			0
if you ca n't make a blockbuster , make a mockbuster ... @entity118 is a partner at @entity119 , a movie production and distribution company based in @entity121 , @entity122			0
the asylum is known for producing low - budget movies ( around $ 500,000 ) that riff off big - budget blockbusters and are often released around the same time			2
on the books this year are " @entity127 , " a twist on @entity130 movie " @entity131 , " and " @entity132 , " another take on @entity135 's disaster epic " @entity136 , " which cost between $ 80 to $ 100 million to make , according to @entity137			2
" we would love to be able to take credit for the mockbuster			0
the practice is called drafting ... it 's been done almost since the industry started			2
just like in bike racing , one racer will ride behind a faster racer and they benefit because there is less wind			0
" we 've just been a little more outrageous			0
our ( movie ) titles try to get as close as possible			0
" and make sure you have an awesome poster ... make them as outlandish as possible , adds @entity154			0
at @entity4 , the trade press pick them up and it 's a great way of getting your name out there if you don ' have a big budget or a high profile cast			1
@entity162 from your fans ... @entity166 indie label @entity164 are famous for making low - budget satires with a ' 50s flavor with titles like " @entity170 , " " @entity171			0
" the movie studio has been running for 40 years and , according to co-founder , @entity172 , @entity164 's secret weapon is their fans			2
at @entity4 , @entity164 fans help the company put on the @entity179 and street theater they 've become famous for , where characters like @entity170 act out scenes from movies			1
" this year , the @entity170 and i have been asked to lead the zombie walk -- there 's a zombie walk ( at @entity4 ) that 's been going on for about 10 years -- we 've been asked to be parade masters			1
" that 's how we get attention because we can not afford to take the big billboards			1
" nothing beats perfect timing ... @entity195 did n't expect much when he took " @entity90 , " a zombie movie he made with a $ 70 budget , to @entity4 in 2008			1
it was a movie he was proud of , but he also realized the timing of his no - budget horror happened to catch the zeitgeist at @entity4 that year			1
" the global economic crisis was at its pinnacle , " said @entity195			0
" so , our story fit very snugly into a success out of that			0
" the press picked it up and the rest was history : @entity195 says the film picked up limited theatrical release in the @entity214 , @entity215 , the @entity166 and @entity216			2
