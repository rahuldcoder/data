-- the @entity1 said friday that the uniforms for the opening and closing ceremonies at the 2014 @entity5 will be made in the @entity6			1
the news came after it was revealed that @entity6 athletes at this year 's games are going to be wearing clothing manufactured in @entity12 -- a fact that sparked outrage from some lawmakers and human rights activists			1
@entity17 and the @entity1 were bombarded on @entity18 and @entity19 by critics who demanded the fashion design company manufacture new uniforms in the @entity6			1
from our readers : forget uniforms , @entity25 should ' go naked ' " with athletes having already arrived in @entity30 , and the apparel distribution process beginning this weekend , we are unfortunately not able to make a change for @entity30 , " @entity1 ceo @entity27 said in a statement			1
" we are absolutely committed , however , to working with our sponsors to ensure that the concerns voiced are addressed			0
to that end , @entity17 has agreed to domestically manufacture @entity38 's apparel for @entity39 and @entity40 for the 2014 @entity5 , " he said			1
" in the meantime , we ask for the @entity6 people 's support			2
the members of @entity38 have dedicated their entire lives to training for this one moment			2
they are some of the finest men and women this country has to offer and they are prepared to succeed both on and off the field of play in @entity30			2
our country should be proud of the individual athletes that will represent them in @entity30 and i 'm hopeful that everyone will rally around @entity38 , " @entity27 said			1
@entity17 similarly released a statement friday , confirming it would manufacture uniforms domestically for the 2014 games			1
" for more than 45 years @entity17 has built a brand that embodies the best of @entity6 quality and design rooted in the rich heritage of our country , " it said , promising to " lead the conversation within our industry and our government addressing the issue of increasing manufacturing in the @entity6			1
" previously , the @entity1 had defended the uniforms			1
in a statement thursday , @entity1 spokesman @entity76 said that " unlike most @entity5 teams around the world , the @entity1 is privately funded and we 're grateful for the support of our sponsors			2
" he described the criticism as nonsense in a tweet			0
in testimony before @entity87 last year , the @entity85 said that 98 % of all apparel and 99 % of all footwear sold in the @entity6 are manufactured abroad			2
according to the @entity91 , 10 years ago , there were more than 350,000 americans employed by apparel manufacturers			0
last month , that number was 147,300			0
@entity95 , a former @entity6 @entity5 swimmer who won 12 medals in a span of 20 years , said the uniforms looked great but would be even better if they were produced domestically			2
" wearing the @entity6 uniform , going out there to represent the @entity6 , it would be nice if it was actually made in the @entity6 , " she said			1
senate majority leader @entity102 , @entity103 , told reporters thursday that " the @entity5 committee should be ashamed of themselves			2
" " i think they should be embarrassed			0
i think they should take all the uniforms , put them in a big pile and burn them and start all over again , " he said			0
@entity111 athletics brand has ambitions to take on @entity113 " if they have to wear nothing but a singlet that says @entity38 on it , painted by hand , then that 's what they should wear			2
" actress and human rights advocate @entity124 took to @entity19 to call on the designer to explain its actions : " please will you tell us why the @entity6 @entity5 uniforms are made in @entity12 ? why not made in the @entity6 ? " @entity124 , known for her advocacy on behalf of children , also called on the designer to heed @entity102 's call			1
" burn them & start all over			0
how bout it ? " she tweeted			0
at least one current @entity5 athlete also raised questions about the uniforms			0
" our @entity17 outfits for the @entity5 opening ceremonies were made in @entity12			1
so , um , thanks @entity12 , " tweeted distance runner @entity144 , who represents the best hope for the @entity6 to medal in the men 's 800 - meters since the @entity148 in @entity149			1
the @entity1 is no stranger to controversy over its sponsorships , with questions being raised over why it opted last year to extend @entity155 's sponsorship through the 2016 @entity156 , following the @entity158 oil spill in 2010			0
it was also questioned as early as the 2002 during the @entity5 in @entity159 about why @entity6 athletes donned berets made by roots , a @entity164 company			1
@entity17 has designed uniforms for the @entity167 in @entity168 and the @entity169 in @entity170 , and both times portions of the clothing were manufactured in @entity12 , according to previous @entity0 reports			1
the revelations about the 2012 uniforms , first reported wednesday night by @entity175 , come at a critical time as the @entity6 grapples with a struggling economy that has hit the @entity6 textile industry hard			1
@entity181 weightlifter 's wish to dress modestly triggers debate it also comes as @entity185 @entity184 introduced a " @entity186 " jobs bill , which was first put forward in 2010 as a manufacturing jobs initiative			0
@entity190 - based fashion designer @entity189 , who boasts a " @entity192 " collection , said she was disturbed by the news that the uniforms were made in @entity12			1
" it 's very disturbing because it completely could have been manufactured here in the @entity6 in @entity190 or in any other city where there 's factories that still exist , " she told @entity0			2
" and it 's frustrating for us because it 's a cause we 've been fighting for , and we 've been trying to raise awareness and trying to convince designers to move work back to our shores and stop off - shoring and start on - shoring			0
this would have been the perfect opportunity			0
" but free market advocates , such as the @entity210 , say none of this is surprising			0
globalization means manufacturing companies will be drawn to countries where the costs are lowest , according to @entity217 of the @entity210			0
" when companies are able to outsource , they are able to produce most competitively			0
they 're able to attend to their costs			0
and if they can do that , then they can deliver better quality , greater variety at lower prices for @entity6 consumers , " @entity217 said			0
the @entity6 is not the only place where citizens have questioned the production of their @entity5 uniforms			2
headlines were made in @entity235 this year when it was revealed that @entity235 uniforms for the @entity238 also were made in @entity12			1
the @entity239 responded to critics by saying it was not financially viable to make the outfits at home , according to local media reports			0
some @entity164 lawmakers became irate in 2008 , when it was learned that @entity164 uniforms for the @entity238 in @entity170 were made in @entity12			1
@entity6 companies have made @entity5 uniforms in the past , notably , @entity250 , @entity249			1
