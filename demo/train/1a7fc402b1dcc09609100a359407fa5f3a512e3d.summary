-- which television series is so good it 's worth binge - watching from beginning to end ? this question was posed over the weekend on the social networking website @entity4 , where community members can solicit feedback from others on topics of their choosing			1
judging from the responses , it seems that a variety of factors make a show binge - worthy , making different shows worth binging on for different reasons			1
some of the most popular selections -- like " @entity18 , " " @entity19 " and " @entity20 : @entity27 " -- had ongoing narratives and gripping cliffhangers at the end of each episode that left viewers anxious to find out what 's next			1
watching densely layered shows like those on a compressed cycle also minimizes the risk of forgetting key details or plot points that comes with waiting a week in between episodes			2
on the other end of the spectrum , viewers recommended fun and breezy comedies like " @entity39 " and " @entity40 , " which require little investment of time or attention but deliver big on laughs and entertainment			0
popular shows that had short runs , like " @entity48 " or " @entity49 , " also make compelling candidates if you can avoid getting emotionally attached			0
this list has been cherry - picked from the exhaustive thread started on @entity4 , so it is by no means exhaustive			0
tell us in the comments what would you add to this list .			0
