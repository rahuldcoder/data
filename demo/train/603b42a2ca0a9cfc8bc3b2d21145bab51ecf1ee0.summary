-- the real referees were greeted with a standing ovation thursday night as they returned to the field after a new contract was announced less than a day earlier			1
it may be the last time fans will voice their opinion on the recent @entity9 lockout that brought replacement referees to the football field			1
thursday 's 23 to 16 win by the @entity13 over the @entity14 went on without much controversy , a far cry from the gaffe - filled display that punctuated the first three weeks of the professional football season			1
for @entity9 officials , it 's a side job that requires a lot of work before thursday 's game @entity9 commissioner @entity24 said he was sorry the league felt it had to resort to the replacements , few of whom had any previous @entity9 officiating experience			1
many were high school or low - level college officials who hold down myriad other jobs , from schoolteachers to attorneys			2
that ended wednesday night when the @entity9 stuck a deal with officials			1
the eight - year deal , which must be ratified by union members , includes details about officials ' pensions and retirement benefits , and adds a pay bump from $ 149,000 a year in 2011 to $ 173,000 in 2013			1
the pay will rise to $ 205,000 by 2019			2
it suspended the lockout that began before the league 's preseason , leading to a series of gaffes that climaxed in a furor over a botched call that allowed the @entity56 to walk away with a victory in monday night 's nationally televised game against @entity59			2
the league acknowledged tuesday that the @entity59 should have won , but allowed the result of the game to stand			2
@entity9 chief apologizes about replacement refs @entity24 declined to criticize the replacements despite weeks of botched calls that raised the ire of fans nationwide			1
" everything they did , every call , was magnified , " @entity24 said			0
" they kept the game going			0
they were incredibly focused and dedicated			0
" @entity77 , a fill - in line judge who lives in @entity78 , said it was a hard job			0
" we worked as hard as we could and we did the best we could , " said @entity77 , who spent 15 years as a @entity81 official ,			0
" none of us felt like we could replace the regular guys			0
you ca n't replace that sort of ability en masse			0
" what the refs were negotiating			0
