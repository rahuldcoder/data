-- is your daughter a tomboy ? your son not especially into football ? does your daughter excel at math ? your son a skilled artist ? or does your daughter switch roles , relatively easily , from skinning her knees on a soccer field to worrying about what to wear to a party ? or does your son , like mine , come home sweaty and bruised from lacrosse practice only to sing gorgeously in the shower as a member of his high school a cappella group ? if your answers are yes -- and probably most parents recognize some elements of these traits in their children -- you can breathe a bit easier today			0
that is , at least , if you happen to live in @entity28 , @entity29			0
that 's because recently , under a legal challenge by the @entity33 and its local affiliates , the @entity31 agreed to abandon for two school years its program of separating boys and girls into single - sex classes			1
the @entity33 had filed a lawsuit on behalf of a mother and her daughters who claimed the sex segregation was a form of sex discrimination against girls			1
this little - noted legal settlement gives all of us -- parents , teachers , administrators , and kids themselves -- something to think about : are single - sex classes really an effective way to educate our children ? historically , of course , single - sex schools -- especially private schools and colleges -- were the norm			1
but since the dawn of the 20th century , both educators and parents have seen them as historic anachronisms , especially for boys			0
single - sex schools for girls may have challenged stereotypes , but single - sex schools for boys reproduced them , fostering what @entity73 and @entity74 , in their monumental midcentury study , " @entity71 , " called " male arrogance			1
" today , single - sex schools may provide some benefits , though these tend to be benefits that accompany the economic privilege of the families that can afford them			1
( that is , single sex private schools tend to also be schools for the elite			2
) but single - sex classes , in otherwise coeducational public schools , are entirely misguided			1
in recent years , single - sex classes in public schools have become increasingly popular as a low - cost remedy for two issues that plague our country 's public school system : the efforts to encourage girls ' ambitions in traditionally " masculine " arenas such as science , technology , engineering and math , and to address the " boy crisis " in schools , the chronic underachievement of boys , especially in traditionally " feminine " subjects such as @entity106			1
it 's a popular theory			0
after @entity116 regulations changed in 2006 , more than 1,000 public schools segregated at least some of their classes by sex , a 2010 @entity113 report said			1
the @entity120 for @entity121 states a lower number â € ” it says 500 @entity125 public schools " offered single - sex educational opportunities " for the 2011 - 12 school year			1
regardless , the theory is wrong			0
in fact , single - sex classes might do more harm than good			1
to be sure , there is some anecdotal evidence that some students prefer single - sex classes ( though they tend not to " prefer " to take calculus and we still insist they do )			1
and especially in inner - city communities , single - sex " academies " have gained popularity because of their brilliant combination of rigid discipline , uniforms and powerful sense of community and school spirit			1
but , according to @entity147 , an education expert , there is no research that shows the " single - sex " part of the equation has any independent effect on student performance			1
instead , evidence points decidedly in the other direction			0
single - sex classes reinforce harmful stereotypes about boys and girls			1
a 2011 article in the journal @entity162 concluded that " sex - segregated education is deeply misguided , and often justified by weak , cherry - picked , or misconstrued scientific claims rather than by valid scientific evidence			2
there is no well - designed research showing that single - sex education improves students ' academic performance , but there is evidence that sex segregation increases gender stereotyping and legitimizes institutional sexism			1
" the article 's authors , all researchers , were also members of the nonprofit @entity178 for @entity179			0
these efforts are often based on the flawed notions of a few educational consultants , such as dr. @entity183			0
he 's the founder of the @entity185 , which is now more innocuously titled the @entity186 as if to obscure its actual mission			0
under these theories , school districts have experimented with different curricula , seating arrangements , pedagogical styles and even room temperature , 72 degrees for girls and 68 degrees for boys			2
according to a brief filed by the @entity33 in 2010 , boys in one @entity198 school read " where the @entity204 " while girls read " @entity205 " because " boys like ' hunting ' and ' dogs , ' but girls prefer ' love stories			2
' " " girls tend to look on the teacher as an ally , " the association 's website explains			0
" given a little encouragement , they will welcome the teacher 's help			0
a girl - friendly classroom is a safe , comfortable , welcoming place			0
forget hard plastic chairs : put in a sofa and some comfortable beanbags			0
" in the case of @entity220 , the school in @entity28 , @entity29 , the @entity33 said the principal defended the layout of the boys ' class -- students seated side - by - side , bright lighting because " when they look at each other in the eye , it becomes more of a confrontational type of thing			2
" girls had dimmer mood lighting , and they would , " sit around tables , where they can make eye contact , where they can make relationships , and that sort of thing			0
" the @entity33 said the mother who challenged the single - sex class arrangement was furious that one of her daughters was constantly told to sit still -- despite the fact that she had attention deficit disorder and the boys in the adjacent classroom had opportunities galore to move around			1
another girl with poor vision struggled to read in the dimmer light			0
a third was prohibited from taking notes during a presentation because her teacher said that girls learn better through auditory , not visual , input			0
i assume that most of the parents of girls find such stereotypes deeply insulting			2
but i 'd hope that parents of boys find them equally insulting -- that boys are only capable of learning in a @entity268 setting , more like boot camp than school			0
what 's the recommendations for boys -- that classes be experienced as unsafe , that we seat them in uncomfortable chairs , bark at them and make them read " if " and " @entity280 ? " we know that boys and girls are as different from each other as they are from every other child			2
parents with larger families often see this better than parents who have one boy and one girl and observe categorical differences between the two , assuming that such differences are somehow biologically hard - wired			0
good social science is different from good parenting , and requires a sample size greater than two			0
if you have , say , six kids , you 'll describe one or two of your boys as " more quiet , a bit shyer " than the others , or a girl as " the tomboy " who " loves to play sports			0
" imagine what would happen to those " nonconformists " in a single sex class that is entirely oriented to the rough and tumble boys or the quiet girly - girls			1
fortunately , the tide is turning			0
as the evidence mounts that single - sex classrooms confuse the norm with the normative , teaching to stereotypes rather than children , parents are challenging every effort as both discriminatory and harmful to their children			1
in the past year , the number of single - sex options in public schools dropped for the first time in more than a decade			1
several schools -- including some in @entity327 ; @entity328 ; @entity329 , @entity330 ; and @entity331 , @entity332 -- have dropped existing or planned single - sex classes after @entity33 involvement			1
our nation 's schools serve us best when they teach our children as individuals , with remarkably diverse personalities and learning styles			2
all our children -- boys and girls -- deserve no less			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity346 .			2

@entity346 : are single - sex classes an effective way to educate our children ?
@entity352 : no , single - sex classes in public schools might do more harm than good
he says single - sex classes reinforce gender stereotypes about boys and girls
@entity352 : some would also argue that sex segregation is a form of sex discrimination
