-- with 20 @entity5 states allowing medical marijuana , and others weighing its medicinal or recreational use , advocates of looser laws on weed appear to have the advantage			1
but leading medical groups remain ambivalent , and opponents are now trying to mobilize for upcoming votes in three states			1
@entity16 will vote on whether to legalize the medicinal use of marijuana in november			1
in @entity20 and @entity21 , the state legislatures are debating medical marijuana , while the @entity23 voted tuesday to decriminalize possession of small amounts of pot. meanwhile , two more states -- @entity28 and @entity29 -- are expected to follow the lead of @entity31 and @entity32 and put full legalization on the ballot in 2014			1
and in the year - plus since the @entity31 and @entity32 votes , public opinion has swung sharply in favor of loosening marijuana laws			1
" that caught everyone , even advocates , by surprise , " said @entity39 , executive director of the pro-legalization @entity41			0
in january , a @entity0 / @entity47 survey found 55 % support for legalization , with 44 % opposing it			0
national polls shifted by about 10 percentage points between late 2012 and late 2013 , with support for legalization climbing to roughly the same level seen in the @entity0 poll , @entity39 said			0
" a lot of people just began to relax and see the sky 's not going to fall			1
all we 're doing is moving a booming market from the underground to the legal world , " he said			0
those trends were seen even in states like @entity66 , where @entity67 gov. @entity67 told @entity0 in february that he 'd be open to the " tightly regulated " use of medical marijuana			1
" if you look at public opinion polls , support for legalizing medical marijuana is over 70 % nationally , even in the @entity73 , " @entity39 said			1
interactive map : a look at marijuana laws in the @entity5 there 's also growing pressure to change the drug 's classification as a schedule i controlled substance , the federal designation for a drug with high risk and no medical use			1
@entity0 chief medical correspondent dr. @entity88 , who hosts an upcoming documentary on the issue , argues that " neither of those statements has ever been factual			1
" changing the designation would allow scientists to put the drug 's purported benefits and risks under closer scrutiny , advocates argue			1
" i have sat in labs and personally analyzed the molecules in marijuana that have such potential but are also a source of intense controversy			2
i have seen those molecules turned into medicine that has quelled epilepsy in a child and pain in a grown adult			0
i 've seen it help a woman at the peak of her life to overcome the ravages of multiple sclerosis , " @entity88 writes			0
" i am more convinced than ever that it is irresponsible to not provide the best care we can , care that often may involve marijuana			2
" two drugs based on chemical compounds found in marijuana -- including the active ingredient , @entity124 -- have been approved by federal regulators and are available by prescription			2
a cannabis - based mouth spray used to relieve chemotherapy side effects has been approved in @entity129 and parts of @entity131 and has been submitted to the @entity132 for its review			0
the @entity134 says research indicates that cannabis derivatives can help alleviate the pain and nausea associated with chemotherapy , but it opposes marijuana smoking or legalization			2
and in november , the @entity142 reiterated its stance that marijuana is " a dangerous drug " that should remain illegal			1
but it also called for additional research and the use of " public health based strategies , rather than incarceration " to control it			0
meanwhile , opponents say residents of @entity31 and @entity32 -- which issued its first marijuana licenses wednesday -- may be feeling some buyers ' remorse			2
" the white coats are off , " said @entity157 , director of the anti-legalization group @entity159			2
@entity157 is a former @entity161 drug policy adviser who co-founded @entity159 with former rep. @entity162 , who has publicly battled his addiction to drugs and alcohol			0
in a letter to federal regulators , the @entity169 and the @entity161 this week , @entity157 , @entity162 and representatives of several leading anti-drug organizations argued that removing marijuana from the schedule i list " would be a mistake			1
" " we do strongly support efforts to research the components of marijuana			2
we should break down the barriers of such research by making it easier for researchers to access , store , and administer such components , " they wrote			0
but that can be done without contributing to " the normalization of marijuana , " they argued			2
dr. @entity88 : ' i am doubling down ' on medical marijuana in states that have voted in marijuana , @entity157 said , residents are uncomfortable with the rise of a new weed industry			1
" what they 're getting is cookies and candies and ring pops that are targeted at kids			0
what they thought they were getting was allowing adults to smoke unencumbered in their own basement , " he said			0
@entity157 said federal laws banning pot are n't changing " anytime soon			0
" his organization is raising money and recruiting volunteers to fight the expected votes in @entity29 and @entity28			0
but he said anti-drug forces expect to lose votes in more states before a backlash against legalization can take root			1
" we do n't need to have voting on medicine , " he said			0
" we need to have medicine in pharmacies that can be prescribed by doctors			0
