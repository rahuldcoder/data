@entity0 , @entity1 -- an investigation into an attack that killed eight @entity6 troops in eastern @entity1 last year said the combat outpost was an " attractive target " because protection improvements had n't been made and intelligence assets had been diverted			1
these were main points in the findings released friday by the @entity6 military into the probe of the october 3 attack on @entity16 in the @entity18 district of @entity19			1
the attack killed eight @entity6 service members and wounded 22 others			2
based on the recommendations in the investigation , gen. @entity28 , the top coalition military commander in @entity1 , " took appropriate action regarding @entity25 personnel involved			0
" the report also praised soldiers of @entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 for repelling the assault by a force of 300 militants			2
commanders must regularly assess " the value and vulnerabilities " of combat outposts , said the report , which " made several recommendations to improve coalition tactics			1
" the base had been scheduled to be closed before the attack occurred , and " needed force protection improvements ( which ) were not made " because of the imminent closure			1
" critical intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance assets which had been supporting @entity52 had been diverted to assist ongoing intense combat operations in other areas , " the report said			1
it also said " intelligence assessments had become desensitized to reports of massing enemy formations by previous reports that had proved false			2
" all of these factors " resulted in an attractive target for enemy fighters			1
" the military says militants had been planning the attack for days , hiding mortars , rockets and heavy machine guns in the mountains			1
the assault started around dawn as bullets and rockets peppered the remote outpost october 3 and lasted for 12 hours , pinning down the exhausted troops			1
one soldier said afterward the insurgency was so fierce that the troops could n't get to their weapons to fire back			0
they called in air support to help thwart the militants			2
" they were under heavy enemy contact , " sgt. @entity83 said			0
four servicemen -- @entity83 , a fellow soldier , an @entity87 helicopter pilot and a gunner -- talked to a military reporter about their roles during the @entity52 attack in an interview posted by the @entity94 on @entity95 and @entity97 's @entity96			0
chief warrant officer @entity98 , an @entity87 pilot , said a few aircraft were damaged in what was a " time - consuming endeavor " governed by tough terrain			0
he said the morning battle was " significant , " but later troops were able to identify targets and eliminate larger weapons			0
" one of the primary reasons for the fight taking so long is that it is an extreme terrain , " he said in the interview			0
the report said the troops killed 150 enemy fighters and " found that the soldiers and junior leaders fought heroically in repelling an enemy force five times their size			0
" members of @entity31 upheld the highest standards of warrior ethics and professionalism and distinguished themselves with conspicuous gallantry , courage , and bravery under the heavy enemy fire that surrounded them			0

lack of protection improvements made combat outpost an " attractive target "
intelligence *failures* also made the base vulnerable to a strike from militants
