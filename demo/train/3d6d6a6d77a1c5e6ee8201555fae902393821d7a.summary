few laws can drive political discourse and posturing like the @entity3 , otherwise known as @entity3			1
the individual mandate was one of its most contentious aspects			0
today , though , it 's another mandate -- the employer penalty -- that is garnering headlines			1
the @entity11 administration announced it would delay the implementation of the employer penalty for a year , until 2015			1
this move is sure to please businesses that employ a large number of lower - wage employees who do n't receive comprehensive health insurance			1
but it 's also been met with other cries of dismay			2
some have declared the delay another bit of evidence that @entity3 is fatally flawed and that it should be repealed immediately			1
others have declared that this delay bodes poorly for the individual mandate , which should not be attacked			0
and still more have taken it as a larger indication of the state of the administration , that it spells doom for immigration overhaul , that it 's a sign of a tyrannical administration , or that it 's just one more illustration of incompetence in getting @entity3 off the ground			1
for the most part , these are all political posturing			2
the employer penalty , like the individual mandate , is just one small part of a very large law			1
it serves a specific purpose , and although @entity3 will not perform as efficiently without it , it will still function			1
the employer penalty is complicated			1
the first thing to know is that it only applies to businesses with more than 50 full - time - equivalent employees			1
any " small business " with 50 or fewer employees does n't have to provide insurance at all			2
if you have more than 50 workers , you have to provide comprehensive insurance to your employees that covers a core set of benefits , and the premiums ca n't cost workers more than 9.5 % of their income			1
if you do n't , you pay a penalty of $ 2,000 for each full - time worker -- your total of employees minus 30			1
alternatively , you can provide them with much less comprehensive plans that meet " minimum essential coverage			0
" but employees can refuse this coverage and instead go to an exchange in their state to obtain health insurance			2
if they do , businesses will pay a penalty of $ 3,000 for each employee who goes to an exchange and qualifies for a subsidy from the federal government			2
these penalties can add up to millions for large employers			0
so companies are taking them seriously			0
but it 's important to put things in perspective			0
it 's likely that more than 95 % of businesses are smaller than the 50 - employee limit , so few need concern themselves with the penalty at all			1
moreover , of the 4 % of employers who are large enough to have the penalty affect them , about 95 % already offer coverage			0
when all is said and done , the employer penalty will likely apply to about 10,000 companies out of about 6 million in the @entity105			1
those companies employ about 1 % of @entity105 workers			1
but the penalty will still be real to these companies			2
they will be thrilled to see it delayed , and they will certainly fight to see it pushed back even further , or repealed			0
there are some reasons to cheer them on			0
the employer penalty , as designed , has a lot of flaws			1
it encourages employers to push people into part - time jobs to have fewer full - time employees to count			2
it also is an incentive to get people to hire more well - off employees as opposed to poorer employees , because they ca n't get subsidies in the exchanges and wo n't incur a penalty for the employer if insurance is n't offered			1
so why have an employer penalty at all ? the simple reason is that it lowers the cost of @entity3			1
helping people buy insurance is expensive			0
when people get their insurance in the exchange with a subsidy , it costs the federal government money			0
when they get their insurance at their job , it costs the federal government much less			0
so pushing the uninsured to their employers , through the penalty , lowers the cost of @entity3 overall			1
if we get rid of the employer penalty , the likely effect is that the number of uninsured will not drop as much , and the cost of the law will go up			1
it 's really that simple			0
supporters of the law do n't like the former , and opponents do n't like the latter			0
so everyone will have something about which to complain			0
but still , the law will function , albeit less efficiently			0
as for me , i 've never had a huge problem with the employer penalty			1
for better or for worse , we have an employer - based insurance system in the @entity105			2
the majority of people living here get their insurance through a job			0
partly that 's historical , because of wage freezes in @entity175 , and partly that 's because the tax deduction for employer - sponsored insurance makes it all the more enticing to get insurance instead of wage increases			1
so if we want to continue this type of system , it makes sense to have employers either provide insurance to their workers or pay some sort of tax , or penalty , to help the government do it for them			2
that does n't mean there are n't better ways to do this			0
first of all , we could uncouple insurance from jobs entirely			0
there 's really no good reason to have the system function this way			2
past proposals , such as the @entity206 plan , would reduce employer - based insurance substantially			2
sen. @entity208 proposed eliminating the employer - sponsored insurance deduction in his 2008 presidential campaign			2
even a single - payer plan , such as @entity212 for all , would accomplish this task			0
short of that , if you want to keep this system intact , other mechanisms such as an overall payroll tax instead of this employer penalty would have removed the various bad incentives to favor wealthy or part - time employees			1
it 's a fixable problem			0
but fixing it would require a functioning government			0
it would need @entity227 to pass a bill replacing or eliminating the employer mandate , and then the president to sign it			0
that 's not going to happen			0
opponents of @entity3 do n't appear eager to fix the law in ways that would make it less unpopular or repeal less likely			2
supporters do n't appear eager to spend political capital to tinker with a law that cost them so much to pass in the first place			0
so we 'll get administrative fixes such as this one , which wind up pleasing few , other than those who enjoy political theater .			1

employer penalty for not providing full health care delayed for a year , till 2015 .
@entity249 : outcry oversized since penalty applies only to companies with 50 - plus workers
employer penalty will likely apply to about 10,000 companies out of about 6 million , he says
@entity249 : it 's all political theater -- @entity3 would hurt without penalty , but it would function
