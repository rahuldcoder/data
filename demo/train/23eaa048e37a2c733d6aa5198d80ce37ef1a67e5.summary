-- the @entity2 will deploy additional ground - based missile interceptors on the @entity5 as part of efforts to enhance the nation 's ability to defend itself from attack by @entity11 , defense secretary @entity1 announced friday			1
still relatively new in his post , the @entity13 chief told reporters that 14 additional interceptors to be installed by 2017 would bring the total to 44			2
it is part of a package of steps expected to cost $ 1 billion , officials said			1
" the reason that we are doing what we are doing and the reason we are advancing our program here for homeland security is to not take any chances , is to stay ahead of the threat and to assure any contingency , " @entity22 said			2
@entity11 says it 's the victim of ' intensive ' cyberattacks friday 's move came after @entity11 recently threatened a pre-emptive nuclear attack on @entity37 and the @entity2 in response to stepped - up @entity40 sanctions over its latest nuclear test last month			1
in december , @entity11 successfully launched a long - range rocket for the first time under what the @entity2 and other @entity45 nations say was the guise of putting a satellite into orbit			1
moreover , @entity13 officials said they became concerned about a mobile missile spotted in a parade last april			1
the @entity54 missile can be moved around the country and hidden , making it harder to detect compared to a missile on a launch pad			2
" we believe the @entity54 does have the range to reach the @entity2 , " said adm. @entity59			2
@entity11 also said last week it was nullifying the joint declaration on the de-nuclearization of the @entity64			0
one of the country 's top generals , according to published reports , claims @entity68 has nuclear - tipped intercontinental ballistic missiles that are ready to be fired			0
while @entity22 said the steps he announced were aimed at addressing the threat from @entity11 and @entity74 , the focus was clearly on the potential for @entity11 to some day follow through on its belligerent rhetoric			1
@entity74 also is believed to be continuing its efforts to develop nuclear weapon capability			0
@entity80 and @entity81 officials have said current @entity2 missile defenses are adequate for the present level of threat , and president @entity85 said in an interview with @entity87 this week that he does not think @entity11 can carry out a missile attack on the @entity2			1
" they probably ca n't but we do n't like the margin of error , " @entity85 said			0
@entity22 said friday that @entity2 missile defense systems in place provide protection from " limited icbm attacks , " but added that " @entity11 , in particular , has recently made advances in its capabilities and has engaged in a series of irresponsible and reckless provocations			1
" however , @entity100 of the @entity101 told @entity0 the planned expansion would only spend more money on a system that does n't work to protect against a still unrealized @entity11 threat			2
the existing missile defense system was " deeply flawed , " said @entity100 , whose foundation opposes nuclear weapons			0
he added that @entity11 was " years away from the ability to field a missile with a nuclear warhead that could hit the @entity2			1
" @entity22 acknowledged a problem with the guidance system of missile interceptors and said further testing would occur this year			1
" we certainly will not go forward with the additional 14 interceptors until we are sure that we have the complete confidence that we will need , " @entity22 said			1
" but the @entity2 people should be assured that our interceptors are effective			2
" he also announced the military will work with @entity123 to increase radar capability to improve early warning and tracking of any missile launched from @entity11			1
@entity11 ready to ' rain bullets on the enemy ' asked how @entity132 would react to @entity22 's announcement , @entity131 @entity130 said : " i hope that they understand that we need to take steps to protect ourselves from potential threats from @entity74 and @entity11			1
" part of the move announced by @entity22 would involve reopening a missile field at @entity141 , @entity142			2
in 2011 , the @entity13 mothballed @entity143 1 , acting on direction from the @entity85 administration			0
instead of permanently decommissioning it , the @entity146 placed it in a non-operational state			0
@entity13 officials testified at a budget hearing at the time that hardening and reactivating the six silos in @entity154 would take two years and cost approximately $ 200 million			0
@entity13 officials testified then that " there are no current threats dictating the need , nor plans to reactivate @entity158 - 1 in the future			0
" @entity161 congressional sources told @entity0 that they argued against the move			0
" @entity11 was doing all sorts of things we could n't talk about publicly back then , " said one @entity161 congressional official who is privy to intelligence briefings			0
" the intelligence did not change			0
this is right where we expected @entity11 to be			0
it takes about two years to order and take delivery of a new interceptor			0
that 's why you have to be ahead of the threat			0
" in his @entity178 last month , @entity85 said the @entity2 would " stand by our allies , strengthen our own missile defense and lead the world in taking firm action in response to these threats			1
" last week , @entity130 told the @entity185 that " @entity11 's shrill public pronouncements underscore the need for the @entity2 to continue to take prudent steps to defeat any future @entity11 " intercontinental ballistic missile			1
a look at @entity11 's escalating rhetoric @entity0 's @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 and @entity195 contributed to this report .			0
