-- @entity1 is the fast food of the @entity3 : easy , quick , satisfying and requiring minimal effort			1
and the new @entity6 smartphone interface is for people who live and breathe the social network above any other site or service , depending on it as a news source and communication hub			1
@entity6 is a free @entity15 app that makes some mild changes to a phone 's lock screen and home screen to deliver more @entity1 features			1
it 's available now in the @entity22 for select @entity15 phones and comes pre-installed on the new @entity25 phone , which we have been testing out			1
cover feed the most prominent feature of @entity6 is the cover feed			1
the phone 's lock screen displays a constant slideshow of friends ' photos and updates that will glide by anytime the device is awake			2
you can like or comment on a status update or image directly from this screen , tap and hold to get a better look at photos , and swipe to flip through the updates going back in time			0
even short statuses are given the full - screen treatment here , displayed on top of a grayed out timeline photo			0
tap on the small profile picture for a friend to go straight to their timeline , or tap on a link to open whatever video or article your friend has posted			0
for people who habitually check @entity1 on their phones , the cover feed combines time wasting with time saving			1
it 's like having a tv constantly on in the background -- your friend 's wedding photos , weather updates , political rants are turned into soothing white noise you can marginally pay attention to while doing other tasks			0
it 's difficult not to constantly glance at the updates as they go by , an interesting photo catching your eye in the background anytime you check the time or get a text message or other notification			0
unfortunately , that allure is n't limited to the phone 's owner			2
friends and family members were easily sucked in by my phone running @entity6 , automatically picking up the device and flipping through the photos			1
anytime your phone is visible and awake , say when you put it on the table at a business meeting or cafe , people can get a peek at your friend feed			1
this has the potential to get really awkward			2
unlike your own carefully crafted timeline , the feed of content coming from all @entity1 contacts is n't controlled			1
there are no settings to pick and choose whose updates show up , so alongside the cute baby and vacation photos from close friends are the uncomfortable drunken photos from a weekend birthday party , political rants from your uncle , weird viral photos you wish you could un-see			0
another downside is that it is way too easy to accidentally like a status or photo , which can get embarrassing			0
there are no ads on the cover feed , but they will be added at some point			1
for many , any enjoyment that comes from seeing photos and statuses effortlessly play on the phone 's screen could be negated as soon as an unwanted advertisement slips in			2
@entity132 to escape the slideshow , use the tiny circle with your profile photo located at the bottom of the lock screen			0
tap on your face and swipe it left to open @entity141 and communicate with your friends through the social network , bypassing text messages or phone calls			2
swipe right to open the most recently used app or up to go to the phone 's main app screen where more facebooking awaits			0
there is no place to swipe to take a photo or post a status update			0
camera shortcuts are common on most smartphone lock screens , and it seems like a curious omission seeing as how most people are taking those photos just to put them on @entity1 or @entity159			2
but its only one step away			0
the main app screen has three new buttons along the top for posting a status or photo or checking into a location on @entity1			1
swipe left or right to see the usual selection of @entity15 apps , which have suffered a bit of a demotion in the @entity6 world			1
chat heads the most clever and useful feature is @entity174 , which will show @entity1 messages from your friends ( along with a bubble showing their profile photo ) no matter what app you are using at the time			1
what makes the chat feature handy is that it does n't require you to go to another app to respond			2
you can reply right there without having to leave @entity188 or whatever app you happen to be using , even move the bubble around so it 's not blocking a certain part of the screen			0
being able to chat away while doing other things is a huge time saver and hopefully something that will be adopted by other operating systems			0
you do n't even need @entity6 to get this feature			1
the company has rolled out an update for its @entity15 app that adds chat heads , so you can multitask away on any @entity15 phone			1
a new update to the @entity1 app also adds @entity174 , but unfortunately it only works inside the app. these are n't revolutionary changes to the smartphone experience			2
for many it will be too simplified , too invasive , too annoying			0
but for a certain segment of internet users it could be a no - brainer update			0
@entity1 says is has over a billion active users , and that includes an extremely wide range of ages and levels of tech know - how			2
smartphone users check the social network 14 times a day , according to a recent survey by @entity224			0
there are many people who 's @entity3 interactions revolve almost entirely around @entity1 , which serves up their news and entertainment and acts as both an e-mail and chat program			1
for these facebook - centric people , a smartphone that caters to how they use the @entity3 will the the most natural upgrade in the world .			0

@entity6 turns @entity15 devices into a tool for checking @entity1 first
the new cover feed feature is fun , but it can get awkward when others see your phone
chat heads is the best feature , allowing you to talk without leaving other apps
