@entity0 , @entity1 -- a long narrow road winds through a thick forest up a hill called the " @entity6 , " on the outskirts of @entity0 in central @entity1			1
the ovens where tens of thousands of bodies were cremated are restored and working			0
the road goes on for miles through the forest , but every once in a while you see an old railway station , a tower , or an old structure withering in the @entity16 rain			0
this road was named " the trail of blood , " by inmates of the infamous concentration camp @entity19 , because of the death marches they were forced to undertake as they were deported to work as slave laborers for @entity1 's defense industry from 1937 to 1945			1
" the trail of blood " leads straight to the entrance gate of the former concentration camp -- a structure with a huge iron gate in the middle , a tower with a clock above , and arrest cells in the building 's wings			1
@entity37 troops saw the horror of the @entity1 first hand when they came through this gate on april 11 , 1945 , and found camp inmates starved to the bone , many too weak to stand			1
" we could n't even show our joy at this moment , which we had been waiting for so long , " said former inmate @entity44 , recalling the day @entity37 troops came to liberate the camp			0
now the camp is getting ready to host president @entity48 , who has a special relationship with @entity19			1
his great - uncle @entity50 , 84 , helped liberate a sub-camp here when he was an infantryman fighting in @entity54 " the survivors see president @entity48 almost like a grandson of theirs , " said the director of the @entity19 memorial , @entity55 , speaking just outside the front gate			1
" the president is related to one of the brave men who came here and saw the @entity1 horror first hand			1
the soldiers only had vague knowledge of what concentration camps actually were , but here they saw people too weak to survive , even after having been liberated			0
" historians estimate that of the 20,000 inmates who were liberated by @entity37 troops , 1,000 died shortly after because of exhaustion and the effects of years of starvation			0
it is easy to see why			0
every building in the @entity19 complex radiates death , suffering and evil			2
in the crematorium , where tens of thousands of bodies were burned , the ovens have been restored and are fully functional			0
in a cellar below the cremation room , meat hooks in the walls were used by @entity89 guards to hang and strangle more than 1,000 inmates , many of them women and children			0
@entity48 will see these testimonies to the barbarism of the @entity95 when he takes a tour of the camp with @entity16 chancellor @entity98			2
he will also meet some of the survivors who @entity55 says feel so close to this president .			2

his great - uncle helped liberate one of the complex 's sub-camps during @entity54
