-- @entity1 is facing its worst flooding since 1942 , with 373 people dead , more than nine million affected and 28 -- or more than a third -- of the nation 's provinces at least partially flooded after a series of strong seasonal storms that brought exceptional rainfall			2
more than a billion cubic meters of runoff are expected to pass through some of the northern parts of @entity12 on its way toward the @entity1 , some 30 kilometers ( 20 miles ) away , as high tides are set to peak on saturday			2
@entity0 takes a look at what the low - lying @entity18 capital , which straddles the @entity19 , is experiencing , with insights from @entity22 , @entity23 's country director for @entity1			1
@entity25 what do high tides mean for the city ? " picture the equivalent of 480,000 @entity29 - sized pools of water trying to make their way through @entity12 at the moment , " @entity22 said friday			1
" combined with the floodwaters trying to get out and the tides coming in ... we could see a perfect storm in @entity12			2
" the capital lies barely above sea level and is already sinking within the @entity19 delta , as sea levels in the @entity1 rise			0
the city is protected by dikes , but they may not be high enough to cope with the current flooding			2
" barriers on the north side of @entity12 are 3 to 3.5 meters ( 10 to 11.5 feet ) high , and water is penetrating these barriers , " @entity22 pointed out			1
especially hard - hit are the industrial areas to the north , @entity52 and @entity53			0
authorities have been diverting waters to the east and west of @entity12 to get them out to the @entity1			2
but dam levels are already at 100 percent capacity , if not more , said @entity22			1
" it 's anybody 's guess what @entity12 will look like in next 24 - 48 hours , " he added			1
@entity25 how protected is the historic heart of the city ? floodwaters have already reached roads around @entity12 's historic @entity66 and @entity67			1
according to @entity70 , the @entity18 media company , the level of the @entity19 had reached 2.46 meters ( 8 feet ) , or sea level , and was expected to rise further by evening			0
flooding had already affected more than 200 of 500 temples in @entity52 province , home to the @entity77 , its governor has said			0
further assessment can not be made until the water recedes , however			0
@entity25 has the transportation network been able to weather the floods , given the elevated roads and rail network ? @entity12 's main international and domestic suvarnabhumi airport is operating normally and is protected with a 22.5 km ( 14 - mile ) , 3 - meter ( 10 - foot ) dike system			1
also running are the elevated @entity86 and the underground metro system			0
nearly 80 highways in 15 provinces are impassable , and northbound rail services have been suspended , according to the government			0
however , trade and commerce have picked up , as people find ways to bypass the floods by going east or west in order to reach the north , @entity22 noted			1
@entity99 , which primarily services domestic flights , has been closed since tuesday night after floodwaters inundated runways and affected the lighting			0
@entity104 and @entity105 , which both usually operate from there , have since moved operations to @entity108			2
the flood relief operation will nonetheless continue to operate from @entity99 , which had housed flood victims but was forced to evacuate them to other locations			0
@entity25 how is @entity12 holding up , as far as water supplies , sanitation and power supplies ? floods in areas to the northeast of @entity12 have forced people to upper floors of dwellings and led to the loss of electricity , water supply and sanitation			1
access to drinking water in remote areas is a concern			0
@entity22 said that despite being in a location that is n't near floods , " the tap water in our residences has taken a funny smell			1
" people are choosing bottled water over boiled water , but finding bottled water in stores is difficult because the shelves are empty			0
power supply , internet and telephone service are functioning normally in the center of @entity12 , he said			2
q. what is the economic toll ? the @entity148 has estimated a 2 percent decline in gdp because of the floods			1
" the urban poor is mostly likely to be the hardest hit , " said @entity22			2
most of the flooding has occurred in flood - prone areas with condensed housing floods have caused $ 5 billion in damage to industries and half a dozen industrial estates , said @entity22 , with @entity163 industries alone facing losses of at least half that amount , he said			1
read more about @entity18 floods stalling automakers although he expressed reluctance to talk about the overall economic impact at this point , @entity22 said certain things were clear : " @entity173 production will decrease in @entity1 , @entity174 and @entity175 , and rice prices will be affected			1
that billions of dollars of investment in the industrial sector are underwater are bound to affect @entity1 's exports , employment situation , economic growth and development			0
" industrial estates could take weeks if not months to drain and get production lines back running again , creating bumps in supply chains and possibly affecting manufacturers ' abilities to get good on shelves by @entity191 , he added			0
rice exports were expected to drop 50 percent in october from the monthly average of 1 million tonnes , according to the @entity194			0
q. what are the positives for @entity12 right now ? the floods have proven to be a political test for the new prime minister , @entity200 , who was elected in july			1
" the government has gone all out , everything they could possibly do to mitigate the impact of these floods , " said @entity22			1
but more striking is the resilience of the @entity18 people , he said			0
" in relief centers and more generally across the country , no one 's talking about red shirts or yellow shirts			0
all people are talking about the floods , helping one another			0
these floods have healed the country in a way that many people do n't appreciate today because the floods are about to come through @entity12			2
" @entity25 what vulnerabilities will @entity12 need to address ? authorities will need to raise dikes and invest in pump station capacity , coastal zone protection and land use planning , @entity22 said			1
the increasing number of floods in @entity1 and the region are consistent with what 's expected as a result of climate change			0
@entity12 and other @entity234 coastal megacities -- like @entity235 and @entity236 -- will flood more often and on a larger scale , if current climate change trends continue , he added , citing a joint report by the @entity23 , @entity148 and @entity240 last year .			1
