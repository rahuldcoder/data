@entity0 -- environmental advocacy groups hope president @entity3 will live up to the words of his second inaugural address that put climate change front and center on the national agenda even though he rarely mentioned it during the presidential campaign			1
but the same advocates , including the @entity11 and the @entity12 , say the president should use the power of the executive branch to further those aims rather than pursuing a congressional strategy			2
@entity17 , legislative director for the @entity11 , pushed the president to focus more on executive orders and regulations from the @entity20 than on legislation			1
" @entity22 is a place where good ideas go to die , " she said			0
" there is a tremendous amount that his administration can do without @entity22			0
he has the authority ; he does n't have to wait for @entity22			0
" @entity31 , senior vice president of the @entity32 , told @entity1 that while " serious climate legislation is n't in the cards this year " the @entity33 understands that congressional " legislation is not the only way to make progress			1
" @entity1 poll : do @entity40 agree with @entity3 on climate change and immigration ? " there is a clear plan of action here , " @entity31 said			1
" it is time to just get started with the rule - making , which is a process that gives ample time for give and take between the administration and industry			0
" included in the list of executive actions that @entity53 and others hope for are curbing carbon emissions among existing power plants , not just new plants , and mandating high efficiency standards to larger trucks and longer haul vehicles			0
those sort of executive branch actions are similar to what @entity3 pushed for during his first term			1
in 2011 , the @entity20 issued new standards on toxic pollutants and mercury emissions from coal power plants			2
@entity3 also finalized regulations requiring that passenger cars and trucks nearly double their fuel efficiency by 2025			2
@entity73 , spokesman for the @entity12 , said @entity3 's first term was successful on environmental issues because of those actions			2
however , he acknowledged that he would have liked to have seen more from the president			0
" you take what you can get and you hope for more , " @entity73 said			0
" i think the president is recognizing this in his speech			0
" why 2013 could be a game - changer on climate in a lengthy paragraph in his address on monday , @entity3 said , " we will respond to the threat of climate change , knowing that failure to do so would betray our children and future generations			1
the path towards sustainable energy sources will be long and sometimes difficult			0
but @entity40 can not resist this transition ; we must lead it			0
we can not cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries -- we must claim its promise			0
" the president made little mention of climate policy in his 2012 campaign and outlined little , if any , specific climate policy plans for his second term			1
@entity3 's climate policies , specifically @entity109 loan and grant programs for developing advanced energy technologies , were used against him on the campaign trail following the bankruptcy of @entity114 , which received economic stimulus money			1
attack ads featured a visit @entity3 made to the @entity119 solar panel manufacturer and @entity121 candidate @entity120 used the bankruptcy to highlight what @entity121 believed were misspent taxpayer funds on unproven energy projects			2
@entity31 called this time period -- the last two years of @entity3 's first term -- the " two years of silence , " when very little talk was devoted to climate change			1
it was n't until @entity132 , an extraordinary confluence of powerful weather systems , devastated coastal @entity135 and @entity136 in late october that the issue of climate change made an impact on the political season			1
@entity3 's speech ties current issues to founding principles before the storm hit , the last time both candidates mentioned the issue in any substantive manner was in written statements to a science organization in september			0
" @entity132 put this thing back on the agenda with an vengeance and restarted a national climate conversation , " @entity31 said			1
" that is the reality , that is what reminded everybody that this issue is not going away , that we need to deal with it			0
" next step : @entity3 's @entity160 speech on february 12			1
@entity31 said he has " every reason to suspect " that @entity3 is going to unveil more detail in that speech about " what he is going to do			2

activists push for @entity3 to focus more on executive orders and @entity20 regulations than on legislation .
president made little mention of climate policy in 2012 campaign and outlined few climate policy plans
@entity132 returned climate change to the political conversation just before the *election*
one advocate anticipates @entity3 will reveal some detail about his environmental agenda in the @entity160 address
