-- this week a @entity2 foundry minted a new coin to mark @entity2 's " reunification " with @entity5 's @entity4			1
@entity8 's portrait was on one side , and a map of @entity4 on the other			1
many , especially outside @entity2 , would dispute the use of the word " reunification			1
" but few would dispute that the coin 's symbolism goes way beyond @entity2 patriotism over a small @entity19 peninsula			1
many @entity2 , particularly those who remember life in the @entity22 times , and under former president @entity23 , see the mark of @entity8 on all of their coins			1
when he took over the presidency in the final hours of the last millennium , @entity2 was licking some serious wounds from the crash of 1998			1
in its @entity32 in october 1999 , the @entity31 observed : " continuing economic and political uncertainties have led to further capital flight and a sharp decline in foreign investment			0
" ring any bells ? @entity8 set about treating those wounds			2
he slashed income and corporate tax and cut red tape			2
aided by rising oil prices , growth climbed sharply , averaging 7 % over the next eight years			0
@entity2 had money and the opportunity to make more			2
high - end shops started to appear in @entity48 and @entity49 , and many people travelled overseas			0
prosperity and stability were prized above all else			0
14 years later , the latest @entity32 from the @entity31 contained unnerving parallels to 1999			0
@entity2 growth prospects were downgraded because of " geopolitical risks "			2
the @entity31 noted that " investment had already been weak , reflecting in part policy uncertainty			0
" @entity60 's echoed that on friday as it cut @entity2 's credit rating to one level above junk			1
to call this full circle would be far too optimistic			0
in 1999 @entity2 was already coming out of a decline when @entity8 took the reins			1
now it may be on a slippery slope			0
while the economy is insulated by an estimated $ 477 billion in foreign currency reserves , sanctions could still hit hard , and there 's a bigger problem : perception			2
@entity76 , an advisor to @entity77 , says he is worried ratings downgrades and lowered forecasts " immediately create additional nervousness in the investment community			0
" @entity2 may not need foreign approval , but it does need foreign money			2
in a 2008 speech laying out @entity2 's goals up to 2020 , @entity8 said : " i stress that we have no intention of trying to take anything away from anyone else			1
we are a self - sufficient country			0
and we have no intention of closing ourselves off from the outside world and living in isolation			0
" it turns out he does -- but is @entity8 prepared to sacrifice whatever economic stability @entity2 has left in the process ? read more : @entity99 : @entity100 must unite to isolate @entity2 read more : five ways the @entity5 crisis could end			1
