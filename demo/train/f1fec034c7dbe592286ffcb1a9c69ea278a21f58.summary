-- @entity3 's anti-racism @entity1 proposed the attendance of officials to specifically " identify potential acts of discrimination " at matches when the newly - created body first met on monday			1
chaired by @entity3 vice president @entity10 , who presides over the continental @entity12 body , the @entity1 also suggested the possibility of points deductions and / or relegation for " reoffenders or for serious incidents "			1
the @entity1 will present a draft resolution at the @entity19 in @entity20 at the end of the month whereupon member associations will vote on the measures			2
" we have a special responsibility in the way we can impact football and society , " said @entity10 during his opening remarks in @entity25			0
" one of the opportunities this task force has is its vast reach throughout @entity3 's 209 member associations , where we can implement the resolutions in every region and every country where football is played , bringing universality to the mechanisms that combat racism and discrimination			1
" the creation of the @entity1 was announced in march after a series of racial incidents affecting the sport			2
in @entity49 , both @entity47 and @entity48 received bans for racial abuse in separate incidents that took place in 2011 but the story that made headlines around the world came when @entity58 's @entity57 led his team off in a friendly in protest at racism from supporters this january			0
@entity57 was swiftly invited by @entity64 to @entity3 headquarters and was one of the first names added to the makeup of the @entity1 , but the @entity69 did not attend monday 's meeting due to playing commitments			1
" @entity74 and @entity75 did n't make today 's @entity3 meet , " tweeted @entity1 member @entity72 , a football journalist and lawyer			1
" i hope they attend the next session			0
views of active players are crucial			0
" in their absence , the @entity1 suggested that officials attend games to identify discriminatory acts " with the aim of easing the pressure on referees and facilitating the availability of evidence , which is not always easy to obtain "			2
the second proposal is likely to be of more interest to fans , especially those who have long argued that points deductions are a more efficient punishment for clubs and national teams than paltry fines			1
the @entity1 suggested the application of sanctions in two stages , with the threat of " a warning , a fine or the playing of a match behind closed doors " for " a first or minor offence "			0
for more serious incidents and those who reoffended , the @entity1 spoke of " points deductions , expulsion from a competition , or relegation "			1
the third proposal from the new body was for the " need to implement the existing sanctions in a harmonized way across all confederations , member associations and leagues "			0
@entity3 president @entity64 , who courted controversy in 2011 when telling @entity0 that racism could be settled by a handshake after the match , announced his satisfaction with the inaugural meeting			2
" very happy with first @entity132 meeting , " he tweeted , before later adding " we want strong & consistent sanctions at all levels of football for any discriminatory act			0
" a second @entity1 meeting is planned for later in the year to discuss how to educate those in football in a manner which reduces discriminatory acts in the game .			0
