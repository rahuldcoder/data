he only sent it out later , when reports emerged that the alleged shooter 's name was maj. @entity19			1
" as soon as we saw what appeared to be a @entity23 name , we issued our statement , " @entity2 said			1
" until that time , we were praying that no @entity23 would be involved			2
" that 's the reality of crisis management for the @entity28 community , said @entity2 , who handles communications for the nation 's largest @entity23 civil rights and advocacy group			1
even without confirmation that the alleged gunman was @entity23 -- there was no immediate determination of any religious affiliation for @entity19 -- the mere reporting of a possible @entity23 name required an immediate comment , he said			1
" that 's unfortunately the world we live in nowadays , " @entity2 said			0
" so often , muslims are accused of not condemning these kind of acts			0
" the @entity11 statement said : " no political or religious ideology could ever justify or excuse such wanton and indiscriminate violence			0
the attack was particularly heinous in that it targeted the all - volunteer @entity50 that protects our nation			0
@entity9 @entity23 stand with our fellow citizens in offering both prayers for the victims and sincere condolences to the families of those killed or injured			1

" the @entity81 also issued a statement " in conjunction with all the major @entity23 organizations nationwide " that condemned the attack			2
" while several news reports have cited one of the gunmen to be @entity50 maj. @entity19 , @entity81 strongly emphasizes that this attack and its perpetrator are in no way representative of the @entity23 people or the peace - loving religion of @entity98 , " the statement said			1
" the individuals who perpetrated this attack blatantly acted against the teachings of @entity98 and humanity , " it added			0
after the september 11 , 2001 , terrorist attacks on the @entity9 , @entity23 - @entity9 reported increased attacks and threats by revenge - minded non-muslims			1
" we 've seen this before , " @entity2 said of a possible backlash			0
" whenever there 's an incident of this type , there 's always the possibility this will happen			0

" we urge national political and religious leaders and media professionals to set a tone of calm and unity			0
