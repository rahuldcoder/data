sen. @entity0 had only kind words for potential @entity4 presidential rivals @entity5 and @entity6 on wednesday , but he argued if he runs he 'll have better credentials to offer than the two former governors			1
" i believe that the central obligation of the federal government ... is providing for the national security , " he said during a breakfast briefing for reporters hosted by the @entity11			0
" the next @entity15 needs to be someone who has a clear vision of @entity19 's role in the world			0
" " for governors that 's going to be a challenge , at least initially , " @entity0 added , " since they do n't deal with foreign policy on a daily basis			1
" the argument offers an early look at what the @entity31 senator 's primary pitch would be if he does decide to make a play for the @entity34 in 2016			2
as a member of the @entity36 , @entity0 has been an outspoken critic of @entity38 's foreign policy , and most recently took the lead in opposing the president 's move to thaw diplomatic relations with @entity43			1
and with the @entity4 primary field shaping up to include potentially a dozen prominent @entity4 , @entity0 's foreign policy experience could potentially offer him a needed boost to break away from the pack			1
but on wednesday he refrained from taking any hits at his potential opponents , calling @entity5 " a very credible candidate " and defending @entity6 against critics who say he ran a gaffe - prone and lackluster campaign in 2012			1
" i do n't necessarily think there were flaws in that candidacy , " he said			0
" i think oftentimes , we forget that in these campaigns , 90 percent of the outcome is determined by the blocking and tackling of politics			0
and i think the @entity38 campaign was a superior campaign operation			0
" he said , however , he 's got the support of his family if he wants to run , and he 's " down to the last decision ... the fundamental one			0
" " and that is , where is the best place for me to serve the country at this time in my life , at this time in my career ? " this weekend could bring some clarity to that decision , when his top aides and donors huddle in @entity75 to discuss the senator 's future			1
@entity0 's made one thing abundantly clear , however , and he repeated it wednesday : he wo n't try to run for both reelection to the @entity36 and for president at the same time			2
" if i decide that i want to be president of the @entity19 , that 's what i 'm going to run for , " @entity0 said			2
" if i decide to make that decision , it will not be with the intention of looking for a @entity88 if it does n't work out			0

@entity0 *praised* @entity5 and @entity6 , but argued governors do n't have the foreign policy chops needed for the @entity34
he said he 'll *choose* between running for the @entity34 or reelection
@entity0 might have some clarity on the decision during his weekend *confab* with donors and *strategists*
