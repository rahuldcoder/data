-- on wednesday , former president @entity1 delivered the first of a series of lectures on public service at his alma mater , @entity6			0
when questioned by a student on the failure of the legislation on gun background check in the @entity11 , @entity1 spoke in parables			1
" you know that old story about , the problem with a cat that sits on a hot stove is that cat will never sit on a hot stove again , but also it will never sit on a cold stove			0
i think this is a cold stove , " @entity1 mused			0
like most parables , the message was clear			0
for the past 30 years , the @entity24 has bought many elections with massive spending and grass - roots campaigns			1
no candidate who has ever been scorched on the @entity24 's stove wants to get burned again , so they cower in the corner			1
politicians quake in fear whenever ceo @entity34 threatens hellfire and brimstone upon any apostate with the temerity to question the @entity24 's gospel of the gun			1
but @entity41 is finally fed up			1
new surveys by @entity43 and @entity44 confirm @entity1 's view that the public has cooled to the @entity24			2
several senators who voted against background checks have taken hits in their approval ratings			1
from february to april , @entity53 sen. @entity52 's overall approval rating dropped 8 %			2
in @entity56 , sen. @entity55 's rating went down 9 % since october			0
and sen. @entity57 of @entity58 saw his rating go down 3 % since october / november			0
alarmingly , for the @entity24 , this show of disapproval is happening in red states that should be gun rights strongholds			1
being on the wrong side of history can be painful			0
today 's more tea - flavored @entity67 politicians find themselves badly positioned on guns			2
their ideological rigidity on immigration reform , marriage equality , reproductive rights , @entity72 reform and numerous other hot - button issues is unpopular			0
when you factor in the outrage over gun violence , @entity67 -- who seem inextricably bound to the @entity24 in the public 's mind -- are under the gun			1
this week , in a town hall meeting , @entity83 @entity82 sen. @entity82 , who voted down background checks , was confronted by the new political reality up close and personal			1
@entity87 , whose mother , @entity89 , was the principal at @entity89 and among the first to be gunned down , asked @entity82 , " you had mentioned that day the burden on owners of gun stores that the expanded background checks would harm			1
i am just wondering why the burden of my mother being gunned down in the halls of her elementary school is n't more important than that			0
" @entity82 defended her vote			0
but questions like the one @entity87 asked wo n't go away			0
we will see how the gun issue plays out on the national stage in the coming months			2
if senators lose support because they refuse to give way to some gun control regulations , we may see some changes of heart			1
this has certainly been the case in the debate over immigration reform			0
senate majority leader @entity115 has promised to bring the matter to the floor again in light of the popular support for immigration reform			2
it 's possible that we may even see a background check bill come back to the @entity11 later in the year			2
of course , the gerrymandered @entity123 is quite another matter			0
so finally , the heat may be on the @entity24 for a change			1
and for the senators who voted against background checks , it looks like they 've jumped out of the frying pan and into the fire			1
as usual , @entity1 saw it coming			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity135 .			2

@entity135 : the @entity24 has bought many elections with massive spending
@entity135 : but @entity41 are finally fed up and seem to be cooling toward the @entity24
he says some senators who voted down background checks saw a hit in approval ratings
@entity135 : more politicians may change their minds if they lose support for opposing gun control
