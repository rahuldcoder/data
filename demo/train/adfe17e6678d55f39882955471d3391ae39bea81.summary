-- one need look no further than the @entity2 to see that funny fare is doing some serious damage this fall tv season			2
led by " @entity6 " on @entity7 and featuring no less than three newcomers -- @entity7 ' " 2 @entity14 , " @entity16 's " @entity15 " and @entity18 's " @entity17 " -- sitcoms have dominated the @entity10 scripted programs in the weekly rankings ( based on delivery of the advertiser - coveted 18 - 49 demographic )			1
" it 's been a while since that 's been the case , " says @entity20 , senior executive vice president of @entity21			2
" at the end of the day , it does seem like there is some sort of groundswell right now			1
" @entity7 claims five of eight highly ranked sitcoms			1
the network 's three other hits are " @entity34 , " " @entity33 , " and " @entity35			2
" " @entity15 , " " @entity17 " ( which debuted to 13 million viewers ) and @entity18 's @entity38 - adorned " @entity40 " round out the crowd			1
" people forget sometimes that comedies are supposed to be fun , but a lot of the comedies are bringing the funny this fall , " @entity20 says			2
" and when you do that , the audience is there for it			0
" the audience also has been there for cable comedies , with @entity53 's " @entity54 " and @entity55 's " it 's @entity57 in @entity58 " coming off all - time highs , even in their eighth and seventh seasons , respectively			0
@entity61 : hit series poised to kill off major character perhaps the biggest surprise of the fall is @entity16 's " @entity15 , " which not only bowed to strong numbers but also built on its lead - in , the buzz worthy " @entity68			1
" that performance , which has continued throughout the newbie 's run , even caught the ratings - crunchers at @entity16 a bit by surprise			0
" did we think we were going to get those numbers ? no , " says @entity77 , @entity16 's executive vice president for strategic program planning and research			0
" but we had a lot of positive signs			0
" @entity77 says pilot testing indicated " @entity15 " would be a potential four - quadrant hit , meaning one that played well to audiences young and old , male and female			1
while preseason tracking put consumer awareness of the @entity91 - fronted comedy at expected levels , @entity77 says , " the intent to view was consistently high			0
we knew we had a show here			0
" @entity61 : tv worth watching tonight @entity77 , who was at @entity97 during " friends " fever , sees " @entity15 " sharing dna with that piece of @entity102			1
when creating an identifiable cast of characters , " you either want to be those people , you are those people , or you remember being those people -- and if you can hit everybody , you have success , " he says			0
" that 's what ' @entity15 ' is			1
" asked how it is that " @entity15 " is even growing out of " @entity68 , " @entity77 cites a good fit between the shows , as well as the 9 p.m. hour 's older - skewing competition ( reality juggernaut " @entity117 " included )			1
to a 12 - 34 demographic that is ripe for the picking , @entity91 and friends offer " a real alternative , " he says			0
much can also be attributed to star power			0
both " 2 @entity14 , " starring wisecracking @entity123 and bubbly newcomer @entity125 , and " @entity15 " have the " sort of appealing characters the audiences love , " @entity7 ' @entity20 says			1
" i do n't think there 's been a female lead sitcom in a while -- much less two -- that featured young , energetic characters			1
" @entity61 : spoilers on ' @entity68 , ' ' @entity136 , ' ' bones , ' ' @entity134 , ' ' @entity138 ' and more ! at @entity7 , the good news expands to its older comedies			1
" @entity34 , " which leads into " 2 @entity14 " on monday nights , " has kind of come out of nowhere " to gain 30 % in the demographic versus a year ago , @entity20 says			1
likewise , " @entity6 's " performance -- netting more than 15 million total viewers at last count , despite replacing one of its leads , @entity149 , with @entity152 -- " is not something anybody could have forecast , " @entity20 says , " and even ' @entity33 ' is up " on thursdays			2
one perspective @entity20 offers on the trend is that in an era of bloated reality shows " that are now two hours in length , " with a half - hour sitcom " you get your laughs and you 're done , and that is very appealing			2
" speaking of unscripted programs , expanded editions of " @entity163 " -- coupled with @entity16 's commitment to post-season @entity168 coverage -- led the network to pull its shiny " @entity15 " off the schedule until november 1			2
@entity77 has been down this road before , and to those who question the tactic , he says , " you 're thinking about this moment , when we have to think about a strategy for the whole year			0
" so while some grumble at the breakout hit 's brief @entity180 status , his attitude is this : better now than later			0
" i get into interesting discussions with my bosses about this , where i say , ' if you 're telling me to put ( new episodes ) on now , you 're going to flip out in january or march when i 've run out , " he says with a laugh			0
" it becomes choose your poison			0
