@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 @entity3 in @entity1 said that it had been warned of a " specific threat " thursday evening against @entity6 near the @entity1 capital , @entity0			1
an embassy statement , which said the warning came from @entity1 police , based on intelligence sources , said the threat involved an unknown terrorist group			1
" individuals planning travel through the airport this evening may want to review their plans in light of this information , " it said			0
the warning comes a day after the @entity22 administration said it was stepping up security for some flights headed to the @entity4 from @entity25 and the @entity26 , reflecting heightened concern that terrorists are developing more sophisticated bombs designed to avoid airport screening			1
specific steps and airports were not disclosed			2
a homeland security official said the @entity34 would work with airlines and security agencies overseas and that the changes would primarily focus on airports in @entity25 and the @entity26			2
the effort does not involve changes to what travelers can take aboard flights			0
but passengers may see additional inspections of shoes and electronics , additional use of scanners designed to detect trace amounts of explosives , and another stage of screening at boarding gates , in some cases , the official said			0
the changes came about based on new intelligence on terror groups trying to build new types of improvised explosives that are harder to detect , the official told @entity2			1
there was no specific plot			0
earlier this week , @entity2 reported the @entity4 was considering new airport security measures because of concerns that @entity66 was working on undetectable explosives			1
tighter security ordered for some @entity4 - bound flights streets awash with troops @entity72 was stepped up thursday on the road to @entity6 , some 26 miles ( 42 kilometers ) outside the capital and the country 's only international airport			1
@entity0 @entity78 spokesman @entity77 said the heightened police presence , backed up by the army , was in response to the potential airport terror threat as well as security concerns around the soccer @entity85 and international events taking place in @entity1			1
departing travelers appeared to undergo detailed screening by anti-terrorism police and other security agents as they entered @entity6 airport ; while those arriving said the security process took longer than usual			1

the @entity159 @entity158 confirmed wednesday that it is also stepping up some of its aviation security measures			1
