-- the first time i spoke to @entity4 , she was having a rough couple of days			1
thirty miles into her attempt to set the record for the world 's longest triathlon , @entity4 , 47 , had to start over due to a @entity11 malfunction			1
the saltwater off @entity13 , @entity14 , was eating away at her gums and throat			0
she 'd been stung several times by sea creatures , so her lips were swollen			0
" i wanted to look like @entity21 , but i probably look like @entity22 in ' @entity23 , ' " she joked			0
her laid - back sense of humor belies an ambitious drive			0
a year ago , @entity4 did n't even know how to swim			1
but on march 20 , she finished swimming 95 miles in the @entity27 to complete that leg of her triathlon challenge			2
on april 4 , she crossed the @entity31 - @entity14 border , averaging about 130 miles a day on her bike			1
in 1998 , @entity34 @entity33 completed a triathlon consisting of a 26 - mile swim , 1,242 - mile bike ride and a 310 - mile run			1
he holds the record for the longest triathlon , according to @entity41			0
@entity4 will more than double that distance , swimming 95 miles , biking 2,932 miles and running 735 miles for a total of 3,762 miles before reaching @entity44 near the end of april			1
it 's a grueling journey , even for someone used to tackling ultra races			1
but there 's something driving @entity4 other than the desire to break a world record : she 's determined to raise awareness about human trafficking and stop it			1
" i 'm prepared to do whatever it takes , " @entity4 said after a particularly rough patch of riding in @entity14			1
" if you do n't risk everything , that 's not courage			2
" just a few days ago , the triathlete hopped off her bike and laced up her sneakers to begin her run into the @entity31 capital			1
" her triathlon route covered major human trafficking routes , " team member @entity66 said when i asked why @entity4 was traveling so far			1
" it was also important to her that the route pass through both countries and both capitals , to unify both nations to fight the issue together and take responsibility for what is happening in and between our two borders			0
" thousands of children are sold for sex every day in @entity14 and the @entity31 , according to @entity82 , a child advocacy group @entity83 has teamed with to film a documentary of her journey			2
" we all know it 's wrong , " @entity4 said			1
" it 's still happening			2
" she was sexually abused , first by a family member , she said , then again later in life			0
at 17 , she said she was kidnapped in @entity93 by men who intended to sell her into slavery			0
she escaped only with the help of the brother of one of her captors			0
some days , when @entity4 finishes her mileage , survivors wait to thank her			1
" you ca n't meet someone who 's said , ' i 've been raped , too ' and go home and not care about it , " she said			2
" what i do is that just remind people it 's not just a cause			2
we 're your family , your sisters , your daughters , your mothers			0
" she tells anyone who will listen that what she 's doing is a metaphor for life			2
if she can do this -- break the world record for the longest triathlon -- then human trafficking can be eradicated forever			1
" this is the best way i can illustrate that nothing is impossible , " she said			0
@entity4 first started running in 2006 when her oldest son , @entity128 , was diagnosed with an incurable eye condition called cone rod dystrophy			1
soon after she signed up for the @entity131 -- and made it 56 miles before having to pull out due to hypothermia			2
since then she 's run hundreds of races and even climbed the world 's seven highest peaks on seven continents to raise money to find a cure for genetic blindness			1
with this triathlon , she 's supporting a new cause			0
anywhere from 600,000 to 800,000 people are trafficked across international borders each year , according to a 2007 report from the @entity147			0
those lucky enough to be rescued are left with permanent physical and emotional scars			0
@entity4 wants the " @entity151 " documentary to change people 's perceptions of true strength			1
it 's not the strength it 's taken her to attempt the world 's longest triathlon			0
it 's the inner strength found in women and children who survive years of unimaginable abuse			0
" it 's only 3,500 miles , " she told me emphatically , at the beginning of her journey in @entity13			1
" it 's so worth it			0
think about it ! it 's a child 's life			0
it 's a human being 's life			2
( this is ) nothing -- it 's nothing compared to that			0

@entity4 plans to swim , bike and run 3,762 miles
she 's running toward @entity44 , where her journey ends
@entity4 says she hopes to raise awareness about human trafficking
