the @entity12 have threatened to kill the photojournalist who fell into their hands in september last year , if @entity15 does n't meet their demands			1
" we have no explanation as to why @entity10 was targeted as a victim , and we currently do n't know why he is being held , " @entity2 tells them			2
he wants his captors to believe that his brother is a good man who cares about @entity6			2
" he has made many lasting friends in @entity6 , " he says			2
special forces raid a raid by @entity11 and @entity6 special forces last month that freed eight hostages could have also rescued @entity10 , but a move by his captors prevented it			1
then this week , @entity29 , or @entity29 , released the video threatening his life and showing @entity33 pleading for it			1
@entity35 , who read a statement for @entity5 in the video , did not name the demands the terrorist group expects the @entity11 government to meet , but said that @entity15 knows what they are			2
special forces planned the raid after @entity5 militants were spotted transferring the hostages into pickups , " chained and covered in blankets , " according to a website associated with @entity6 's defense ministry			1
militants drove them to a cave over 65 miles away from the town of @entity52			0
@entity11 and @entity6 special forces outfitted with night visors embarked on the mission about four miles from the cave			1
they encountered the kidnappers near its entrance ; a gun battle ensued , and the special forces killed all seven abductors			1
they also freed eight chained up hostages , who told them that militants had moved five more hostages to another location , according to the @entity6 defense ministry account			1
' we mean no harm ' his brother @entity74 asks the @entity29 militants not to fault @entity10 or his family			1
" he is not responsible for any actions that the @entity11 government has taken			2
please understand that we had no prior knowledge of the rescue attempt for @entity10 , and we mean no harm to anyone , " @entity2 said			2
the @entity6 account did not mention the @entity85 , but a @entity11 official confirmed their participation			1
@entity90 , at the request of the government , delayed reporting the information about the raid , so as not to endanger the search for @entity10 and the other hostages at that time			1
@entity10 appeared in the @entity29 video asking for help and identifying himself			1
" my name is @entity10			0
i 'm 33 years old			0
