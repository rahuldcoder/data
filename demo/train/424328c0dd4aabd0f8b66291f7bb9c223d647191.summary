-- @entity2 's family had been preparing for a homecoming in @entity4 after learning that @entity6 's government was going to release him			1
the 32 - year - old orthopedic surgeon was arrested for entering @entity6 without a visa more than a year ago after volunteering to treat wounded victims of that country 's civil war			1
after his mother personally pleaded with top @entity6 officials to free him , they appeared to have relented			1
a member of the @entity17 , @entity18 , was planning to fly to @entity19 to bring him home on friday			0
instead , his family was told that @entity2 was dead by his own hand , found hanging in his cell -- a report his brother called " absolute slander " tuesday			1
" all the signs were that they were teeing him up for release ... and now somehow , in a shroud of mystery , he 's just hung himself , " the brother , @entity30 , told @entity0			2
" it makes no sense			0
" their grief came as @entity6 government aircraft pounded the city where @entity2 was arrested for a third day , killing more than 70 people , opposition activists reported			1
@entity2 had been volunteering in @entity38 , the country 's largest city , when he was taken into custody in november 2012 , his brother said			1
he had always wanted to put his medical degree to work for relief agencies , and began working with a charity in @entity44 that summer , his brother said			2
" there 's no suggestion he was there for anything other than just humanitarian causes , " he said			2
' i think he 's been silenced ' @entity2 was on his second trip into @entity6 , having crossed the border through a checkpoint manned by the rebel @entity54 when he was arrested , @entity30 said			1
" it may be naive , but he understood some of the risks there , to help people on the ground there , " he said			0
" he worked 40 hours nonstop , operating on critically injured individuals , saving the lives of women and children			0
" then he " disappeared off the radar			0
" his family learned of his arrest six months later via diplomats from @entity70 , their ancestral home , @entity30 told @entity0			0
his mother flew to @entity19 , where she " rung every bell , knocked on every door and groveled " in an attempt to secure his release			0
@entity6 officials eventually transferred @entity2 from military custody to a civilian lockup , where his mother was allowed to visit , @entity30 said			1
he was emaciated and showed " clear signs of maltreatment , " but his condition had improved before his transfer			0
he wrote letters home " almost every other day , " the last telling them his release appeared to be in the works			2
instead , they were told monday that he had killed himself			2
" it 's just trying to defend them against the indefensible , " @entity30 said			2
" he 's been summarily executed without trial or due process ... i think he 's been silenced for whatever he might have to say			0
" in a statement posted online tuesday , @entity18 -- the fiery leftist and political celebrity -- said he had been working with @entity6 officials for months to try to secure @entity2 's release and had been scheduled to bring him home from @entity19 at week 's end			1
" i think we will have to wait for clarification on how exactly he died , but this is heartbreaking and devastating news for his family who have been working so hard for so long to secure his release , " he said			0
" particularly because his freedom had been agreed and he was due to return with me in the next few days			0
my sincere condolences go out to his family , whose pain is unbearable			0
" there was no immediate comment on @entity2 's death from @entity6 government agencies			1
from metropolis to battlefield more than 100,000 people have been killed in @entity6 's nearly 3 - year - old civil war , according to the @entity113			1
in @entity38 , the relief agency @entity114 said hospitals have been " overwhelmed " by casualties after waves of airstrikes using so - called barrel bombs : drums packed with explosives and shrapnel and dropped by helicopters			1
" for the past three days , the helicopters have been targeting different areas , among them a school and the @entity131 roundabout , where people wait for public transport vehicles , " said @entity124 , a @entity114 coordinator in @entity6			2
" in both cases , there were dozens of dead and injured people			0
a dozen bodies were being lined up in front of three hospitals waiting to be recovered by the families			0
" by tuesday , new attacks had killed 73 people , including five children , bringing the three - day toll to 212 , according to the opposition @entity144			2
the state - run @entity145 did not explicitly mention the use of barrel bombs tuesday , but said " armed terrorist groups were entirely eliminated " in several parts of @entity38			1
state media often describes opposition forces bent out ousting president @entity153 as " terrorists			0
" tuesday 's carnage follows two days of intense bloodshed in what was once @entity6 's economic hub			1
at least 83 people were killed sunday by aerial bombing in @entity38 , including 27 children , the @entity144 said			1
another 56 people died there monday from similar attacks , the dissident group said			0
entire buildings have been flattened in the blasts , the opposition @entity166 said			0
@entity170 spokeswoman @entity169 decried the alleged use of barrel bombs			1
" we strongly condemn the latest development from over the weekend that the @entity153 regime has dropped barrel bombs in and around @entity38 , killing dozens , including women and children , " she said			1
" these bombs and the explosive materials contained within them further underscore the brutality of the @entity153 regime and the lengths they will go to attack and kill their own people			0
" @entity6 's descent into civil war began in march 2011 , when @entity153 's regime forcefully cracked down on peaceful anti-government protesters			1
@entity0 's @entity189 contributed to this report .			2
