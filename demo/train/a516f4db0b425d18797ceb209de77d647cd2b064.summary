on guns , president @entity0 needs a " @entity2 " the president himself recognizes that the votes probably are n't there to pass any significant gun legislation through @entity8			1
in his @entity10 address , he was reduced to pleading with @entity8 to allow a vote at all , never mind actually enact anything			0
even if @entity8 were seized by a sudden change of heart , the measures the president has proposed seem unlikely to achieve much			2
@entity17 background checks would be a baby step forward			0
but until state governments join background checks to some effective system of gun licensing , the checks are very easily evaded			2
a felon or domestic batterer or disturbed person need only find a person with a clean background to buy a weapon for him			0
but here are two things that can make a real difference -- without a vote in @entity8			0
first : the president can direct the surgeon general to compile a scientific study of the health effect of individual gun ownership			1
photos : coming to grips with guns the basis of the whole gun debate in the @entity43 is the belief by millions of @entity43 that they need a firearm in the home to protect themselves from criminals			1
testifying to @entity8 last month , a gun advocate named @entity51 presented a vivid image of how guns might be used			1
" an assault weapon in the hands of a young woman defending her babies in her home becomes a defense weapon , and the peace of mind that a woman has as she 's facing three , four , five violent attackers , intruders in her home , with her children screaming in the background , the peace of mind that she has knowing that she has a scary - looking gun gives her more courage when she 's fighting hardened , violent criminals			1
such @entity74 - like defenses of home and hearth do not happen in real life , unless the home also happens to contain a meth lab. ( the oft - cited statistic that gun owners draw in self - defense 2.5 million times a year is a classic of bad social science			2
) incidents like these , however , do happen -- and tragically often : " a fourteen year - old girl jumped out of the closet and shouted ' @entity90 ' when her parents came home in the middle of the night			0
taking her for an intruder , her father shot and killed her			0
her last words were ' i love you , @entity99			0
' " that true story , reported in the @entity101 in 1994 , appears on page 70 of the classic study " @entity107 " by @entity104 , director of @entity106 's @entity105			2
it 's just one of thousands of similar incidents in the @entity43 every year			1
@entity104 again : " between 1990 and 2000 , an annual average of 320 children zero to fourteen either committed suicide with guns or were accidentally killed by guns			2
" @entity43 children are much more likely to suffer these tragedies than children in other countries			1
states with more guns suffer more than states in which guns are less common			2
complete coverage : gun debate claims that homeowners often use guns for legitimate self - defense dwindle away on close examination			1
what the gun owner claims as self - defense often looks , on closer examination , more like trigger - happy recklessness			2
here 's another case , as reported by @entity104			2
" two women , aged thirty - four and forty , were driving home from work when one cut the other off on a congested highway			0
their rage escalated as traffic crawled for miles and the women flashed their headlights and hit their brakes			0
both vehicles left the interstate , heading for home			0
at the first traffic light , one woman left her car and approached the other , perhaps to end the confrontation			0
the woman in the car shot the approaching woman in the face , killing her			0
" self - defense ? maybe			0
but the shooter herself was n't so sure			2
she was recorded weeping , " oh , my @entity163 , i shot her			0
oh , my @entity163 , i ca n't believe i shot her			0
oh , my @entity163 , i ca n't believe she 's dying			1
" as for guns in the home , @entity104 reports studies find that " ( @entity171 ) uns are used far more often in the home to intimidate and frighten intimates than to protect against intruders			0
" these are facts about guns that are well - known to the social scientists who study gun injury but poorly understood by the general public			1
read more : @entity0 in @entity180 to talk guns fifty years ago , @entity43 contended with similar public ignorance -- and similar industry misinformation -- about the hazards of cigarette smoking			1
the argument was settled by the famous surgeon general 's report of 1964			1
@entity8 in the mid- 1990s forbade the federal government to fund its own research into the health risks presented by guns			0
by now , however , enough research has been done by privately funded scholars that the surgeon general could write a report based on existing material			1
such a report would surely reach the conclusion that a gun in the home greatly elevates risks of suicide , lethal accident and fatal domestic violence			1
the first step to changing gun policy is to change public attitudes about guns , as @entity43 previously changed their attitudes about tobacco and drunken driving			1
the surgeon general can lead that attitude change with more authority than any other public official			1
the second step that might be taken -- again without the need for any congressional vote -- is for the @entity220 to convene hearings into the practices of the gun industry analogous to those it convened into the tobacco industry in the 1990s			1
read more : gun focus shifts from ban to checks and trafficking so many gun accidents occur because guns almost never indicate whether a bullet is present in the chamber			1
a gun owner might remove the gun 's magazine and believe the gun unloaded , when in fact it still contains one potentially deadly shot			1
why not require guns to be equipped with indicator lights ? why not require that guns be designed so that they will not fire if dropped ? we have safety standards for every consumer product , from children 's cribs to lawnmowers , except for the most dangerous consumer product of them all			1
not only that , @entity8 has actually immunized makers of that product against harms inflicted by unsafe design			0
gun makers often design their weapons in ways that present no benefit for lawful users but that greatly assist criminals			0
they do n't coordinate the issuance of serial numbers so that each gun can be identified with certainty			1
they stamp serial numbers in places where they can be effaced			0
they reject police requests to etch barrels to uniquely mark each cartridge fired by a particular gun			0
they sell bullets that can pierce police armor			0
they will not include trigger locks and other child - proofing devices as standard equipment			0
they ignore new technology that would render guns inoperable by anyone except their approved purchaser			0
why ? why ? and why ? @entity43 gunmakers have never been required to answer these questions			1
but one @entity220 subcommittee chairman with subpoena powers could cast much needed light on an industry whose record makes the tobacco industry look a paragon of transparency and accountability in comparison			2
there 's a gun agenda that need not depend on politics and that will not snatch a single weapon from any owner , whether law - abiding or not			2
if @entity8 stalls on the president 's ambitious legislative schemes , the president should fall back on this @entity313 to publicize what guns really do to those who carry them -- and what gunmakers do to their customers .			1

@entity321 : @entity0 may not have votes for gun legislation to pass
he says president 's " @entity313 " could be a surgeon general 's report on hazards of guns
@entity220 could hold hearings to ask gun manufacturers about actions they could take
@entity337 : why is n't the most dangerous consumer product in @entity43 being regulated ?
