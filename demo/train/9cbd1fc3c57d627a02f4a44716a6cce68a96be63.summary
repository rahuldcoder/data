at @entity5 , on the northwestern coast of @entity4 's @entity3 island , they once chased ghosts			1
now , along the beautiful forest paths that surround the 800 - year - old castle , they chase edible flowers , wood sorrel and other wild ingredients that in recent years have pushed the country 's restaurants to the forefront of global gastronomy			1
@entity17 now stands as a beacon of @entity20 terroir cooking , largely thanks to @entity21 , a former chef at @entity25 's world - beating @entity23 restaurant , who was drafted in seven years ago to head up its two restaurants			1
today the castle is considered one of the truest representations of soil - to - plate dining			1
add water , dunes , fields and forest to that equation and you get an idea of the rich and rewarding natural surroundings the chefs get to work with			2
anyone spending the night here can practically pop down in their dressing gown and slippers to pick wild herbs for morning tea			2
it 's well worth spending the night			2
the castle 's historic rooms have been beautifully restored as hotel facilities			1
baroque salons most of the suites are located along the corridors in between baroque salons and dining halls , and with views of the moat , garden or courtyard			0
they 're fitted for modern comfort with whirlpool baths and distinctive period features such as canopy beds or chandeliers			0
there are no tvs to spoil the occasion , but coming to @entity17 to watch television is missing the point			0
" the habitat here is really fascinating , " says @entity71 , a forest ranger who organizes foraging safaris around the fields , waters and woodland near @entity17			1
the castle is located in the region of @entity80 , an area designated by @entity81 as a geopark			1
" there is a tension field between the geology created by the ice age , with clay and calcium - rich soil , and then the elevated seabed which came later , " says @entity71			2
" we have all types of nature			0
you have sand dunes , which have been overgrown with juniper berries and thyme , and you can walk through lush forests full of ramsons ( wild garlic )			0
" foraging safaris take place from early spring until autumn			1
@entity71 preps novice foragers by giving them plant samples a set of photo fact sheets			0
he never picks or shows anything potentially toxic			0
" if people see me holding a poisonous plant they will mistake it for being edible , " he says			0
" some people are so keen and quick on the trigger to collect that they will pick up anything			0
" beach herbs @entity71 guides visitors through the soft forest ground , brimming in spring with wood sorrel and ramson , past the black cheery trees , which @entity21 uses in the castle kitchen for making breads and tea , and down the fields scattered with juniper bushes			1
from the elevated castle grounds there are views of nearby @entity129 bay where beach herbs peer up through the dunes and banks			2
" in the summer there is arrowgrass , which tastes of coriander , " says @entity71			0
" all year round we find scurvy grass , which is what the @entity138 used to bring around @entity140 as a medicinal herb			2
we also call it wasabi wort because of its intensity , just like horseradish			0
" on a good day , glasswort , beach mustard and saltbush can also be found			0
anyone here on a wednesday morning might spot @entity21 lurking around the beach , scouring for ingredients and getting a firsthand briefing from nature of what his menu is going to look like			1
@entity17 's first - floor restaurant , @entity159 , has a relaxed bistro feel			1
one of its lunchtime favorites is potato salad and house - made ramson sausages sprinkled with wild herbs from the beach and forest			2
downstairs in the cellar restaurant , underneath the whitewashed stones that arch over designer wooden tables , @entity21 realizes his idea of a gourmet experience dictated by seasons and produce			1
" i try to create a cuisine that reflects the nature surrounding us , " says @entity21			1
" it should represent this very moment in time			0
" we are being very conscious about it , trying to keep it in tune with nature 's rhythm			2
" @entity188 flowers while @entity21 has a basic blueprint for the food he 's cooking , the weekly excursions to the beach and the woods is where he finesses his dishes			1
" we might have veal tongues or sweetbreads as our starting points , but then we go out and see what we can find to pair it with , " he says			0
on a recent autumn morning , @entity21 went to the fields to find wild violet flowers ( " they taste like @entity188 bubble gum " ) , which he put together with caramel mousse , thyme and rye bread			1
he used reduced seawater from the bay , rather than salt , to season the caramel			0
down by a water hole in the forest , he stumbled on a bed of wild mint			0
" it 's completely crazy but it 's not too minty , " says @entity21			1
" if you made mojitos with it , it would be a disaster because it would n't add what you expected			0
its aroma is very subtle and elegant			0
" i use it to marinate meat , like a carpaccio , because it 's not too perfumed or too overpowering			2
" @entity21 and @entity71 sometimes go on their own private foraging sessions where they talk tastes , plants and new ideas			1
when @entity21 was serving grilled breads on a stick -- a @entity4 children 's favorite known as snobrod -- @entity71 suggested he try using branches from a black cherry tree			1
this , said @entity71 , would add almond flavor			0
@entity21 was so impressed that he ended up putting the branches through a wood chipper and used them to cook a syrup			2
" you also have to evolve as a chef , " said @entity21			1
" there might be some things you did n't initially like but all of a sudden you get into it			0
it changes all the time			0
" " i still get blown away by what 's here			2
" @entity5 , @entity260 , 4534 @entity261 , @entity4 ; +45 59 65 33 00 foraging trips run from april to october .			1
