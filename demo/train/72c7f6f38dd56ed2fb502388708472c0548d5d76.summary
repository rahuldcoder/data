@entity0 , @entity1 -- many of the pilots assembled at the @entity5 can boast breaking the sound barrier , but only one man in the world can say he 's done it both in the sky and on the ground			2
that privilege belongs to former fighter jet pilot @entity13 ( @entity13 ) wing commander @entity15			2
as the driver of @entity17 -- the fastest car on the planet -- he broke the sound barrier in 1997 with a world land speed record of 763mph			1
despite the roar of the display jets passing overhead , he remains focused on more terrestrial matters : the quest to drive a car over 1,000 mph with @entity27			1
" as with everything i do in life , being able to do difficult things and do them well is hugely satisfying , " he says from the roof of the @entity30 chalet at the event			0

" basically we 're trying to do what no one has done before , " he says			0
" i 've got five supersonic runs , which is five more than anybody else			0
that gives me a unique perspective on the challenges facing the new car and how we 're going to take it a lot further			0
" the design of the car took years to perfect and while it still generally resembles a rocket on wheels , there are plenty of things that make it much more than just a fighter jet without the wings ; one of the biggest challenges is dealing with the shockwaves caused by the wheels traveling at such high speeds			2
something that the car does have directly in common with a fighter jet is the engine			0
it uses an @entity75 engine normally found on a @entity30 jet			0
it was one of the test - and - development engines donated by @entity30			1
it 's as close as @entity15 gets to a jet engine these days ; the 51 - year - old flew missions over @entity83 and @entity84 and was in charge of running the @entity13 's air campaign missions over @entity87 in 2011			1
during that campaign he says that the success rate of the engine was 97 % , which means he has no concerns about sitting in front of one and hurtling across the ground at previously unimaginable speeds			0

the project is clearly quite attractive to the @entity105 scientific community as well , as it 's backed by the @entity105 government 's engineering and sciences agency , universities , the armed forces and a number of other organizations			1
in order to garner as much interest in science and engineering as possible , the project is mostly open - source ( some technical points about engine performance are withheld )			0
it also aims to broadcast the test runs and record attempts live			2
" that 's almost as big a challenge as getting a car over 1,000 mph , " says @entity15			1
with a chassis built , the aim is to roll out the vehicle for its first tests at the @entity128 in @entity129 , southwest @entity130			0
if everything goes well , the car will be transported to the @entity134 desert in @entity135 where @entity15 and the team will test the vehicle and push it past the speed of sound			1
" the idea is to then go back in 2016 and get it above 1,000mph			0
" it took three years to clear a 12 - mile stretch of desert to make a test - run - ready track -- an enormous undertaking that perhaps reflects the ambitions of the project itself			1
@entity15 was finally given the green light this month			2
ironically , the fastest man on earth does n't have much time to actually sit back and appreciate the experience			0
" [ when driving ] , the ground is terribly close , going past terribly fast , and that 's just one of those background things where you have to say , ' yup , that should be a mind - blowing sensation			1
' but i ca n't afford for it to be , i have to concentrate on doing my job			0

in 1997 , @entity15 and broke the world land speed record driving the @entity17
@entity15 drove the car to 763mph , and is now *hoping* to push it past 1,000mph
the @entity27 , as its known , is backed by the @entity105 government
it took three years to turn 12 miles of desert into a test - run track
