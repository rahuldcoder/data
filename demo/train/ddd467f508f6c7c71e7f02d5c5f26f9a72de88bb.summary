-- conditions favorable to life may once have existed all over @entity4 , the @entity1 said friday			1
two spacecraft have found evidence that liquid water was widespread over the red planet			1
the @entity1 's @entity9 and @entity11 's @entity10 have discovered hydrated silicate minerals in the northern lowlands of @entity4 , a clear indication that water once flowed there , the @entity1 said			1
the two spacecraft had previously found thousands of small outcrops in the planet 's southern hemisphere where rock minerals had been altered by water , it said			1
many of these outcrops are in the form of hydrated clay minerals known as phyllosilicates			0
they indicate the planet 's southern hemisphere was once much warmer and wetter than it is today			0
no such sites had been found in the northern lowlands until this week , the @entity1 said			2
the northern lowlands are covered in thick blankets of lava and sediments up to several kilometers thick and that had hampered efforts to probe what lay beneath			0
the @entity1 's @entity9 found the first hints of water in the northern plains , but the outcrops were small and more detailed observations were needed to confirm the evidence , the @entity1 said			1
@entity11 's orbiter provided higher resolution data that showed at least nine northern craters with phyllosilicates or other hydrated silicates , the @entity1 said			1
the finding was reported this week in the journal @entity48			0
those minerals formed in wet environments and were identical to those found in the southern hemisphere			0
" we can now say that the planet was altered on a global scale by liquid water more than 4 billion years ago , " said the report 's lead author , @entity53 of the @entity55			2
scientists said it 's difficult to draw conclusions about the type of environment that existed on @entity4 when it had water , but they do have some clues			2
the sites " are rich in iron and magnesium , but less in aluminum			0
together with the close proximity of olivine , which is easily modified by water , this indicates that the exposure to water lasted only tens to hundreds of millions of years , " said @entity71 , the @entity72 principal investigator from the @entity55			0
the scientists ' search concentrated on 91 sizeable craters where incoming asteroids have punched down the planet 's surface by several kilometers , exposing " ancient crustal material , " the @entity1 said			0
the results could also suggest sites for future @entity4 landers , because evidence of water during the planet 's early history suggests conditions in those spots may have been favorable to the evolution of primitive life , the @entity1 said .			1

liquid water was once widespread over @entity4 , scientists say
evidence was discovered by @entity11 and the @entity1
it shows water once existed in the northern hemisphere
evidence of water previously had been found only in southern areas
