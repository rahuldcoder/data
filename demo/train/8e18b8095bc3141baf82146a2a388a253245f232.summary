-- as investigators scramble to figure out who killed two @entity4 prosecutors , suspicions abound over whether the @entity6 of @entity4 played a role			1
authorities have not officially linked the two slayings , nor do they know whether the white supremacist group ordered the attacks			2
but a series of events leading up to the killings have raised questions about the group 's possible involvement			2
here 's a primer on the @entity6 of @entity4 : what is the @entity6 of @entity4 ? the @entity20 describes the group as a " whites only , " prison - based gang that has been operating since at least the 1980s			1
" i think the @entity6 of @entity4 today is arguably the most violent white supremacist prison gang out there , " said @entity24 of the @entity25			1
the group has been blamed for more than 100 homicides and at least 10 kidnappings since the early 1980s			1
is the @entity6 of @entity4 part of the @entity6 ? no. inmates in @entity4 asked the @entity6 , a @entity32 - based prison gang , for permission to start a @entity4 chapter , but they were denied membership , the @entity25 said			1
it 's not clear why			2
nonetheless , the @entity4 - based group modeled itself after the @entity32 gang			1
what does the @entity6 of @entity4 stand for ? like the @entity6 , the @entity4 group 's main purpose morphed from protecting white inmates to criminal activities involving drugs , extortion and murders , authorities say			1
it also espouses a white supremacist ideology			0
" at the end of the day , these organizations are really fundamentally criminal enterprises , " @entity24 said			0
" that means , above all , their interest is in green			0
skin color comes long after that			0
" its reach began to extend outside prison walls as more members finished their sentences			0
@entity66 members on parole are required not only to remain loyal to the gang , but also to recruit new members			0
" brutal beatings , fire bombings , drug trafficking and murder are all part of @entity66 's alleged standard operating procedures , " said @entity70 , a former assistant u.s. attorney general			0
did the group play a role in the deaths of @entity81 district attorney @entity80 and assistant district attorney @entity82 ? authorities do n't know			2
but @entity80 's office was one of numerous agencies involved in a multi-year investigation that led to the indictment of 34 alleged members of the @entity66 -- including four of its senior leaders -- on racketeering charges in november			1
at the time , @entity70 called the indictment a " devastating blow " to the organization			0
weeks later , the @entity96 issued a statewide warning saying it had " credible information " that members of the group were planning to retaliate			2
in an interview with the @entity102 after @entity82 's death , @entity80 said his deputy had n't been involved in the @entity6 of @entity4 investigation			1
but the district attorney nevertheless raised the possibility the group was behind the death			0
" we put some real dents in the @entity6 around here in the past year , " @entity80 told the news agency			2
how do members join the @entity6 of @entity4 ? " it is said to be one of the gangs that live by the ' blood - in , blood - out ' code , meaning that you can only get into @entity66 by carrying out some kind of attack , " @entity24 said			1
" and similarly ... you can only leave in a body bag			0
" @entity0 's @entity125 contributed to this report .			0
