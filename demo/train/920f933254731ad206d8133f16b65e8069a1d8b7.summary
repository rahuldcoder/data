-- there is a new man tasked with fulfilling @entity5 's @entity4 destiny			1
but for a nation still smarting from the pain of that humbling 7 - 1 semifinal defeat to @entity12 , the announcement that @entity7 is back in charge might raise a few eyebrows			1
the 50 - year - old is a legend in the country after making 91 appearances for " @entity17 " and leading the side to @entity4 glory as captain in 1994			1
and yet during his previous four - year spell as coach of the national team , he could only take @entity5 to the quarterfinals of the 2010 tournament , as they lost to @entity27			1
@entity7 replaces @entity28 -- the country 's 2002 @entity4 winning coach , who resigned after overseeing a heartbreaking conclusion to the 2014 installment			1
after that pummeling by eventual winners @entity12 -- @entity5 's biggest ever @entity4 defeat -- they were then beaten 3 - 0 by @entity27 in the third place playoff			1
such a dramatic conclusion left the nation in shock and @entity28 , who took responsibility for the horror show against @entity12 , stepped down last week			1
now @entity7 is determined to put a smile back on the fans ' faces			1
" i am immensely happy -- thank you for your confidence in me , " he said in a press conference , after taking control of the five - time world champions			2
" the fans are very down right now but they are right behind the team which means so much to them			2
" i am not here to sell a dream , we must get down to work			2
we must get results and forge a side for 2018			2
this team is very young			2
we must find the way to blend new players with those who have more experience			2
" we have to work conscientiously			0
and not just the players , but the press and the fans too			0
" @entity66 -- known as @entity66 -- was thought to be a frontrunner for the job but the manager of @entity71 - based side @entity69 has been overlooked			0
that might be related to the recent appointment of @entity74 as @entity5 's new technical director			1
he was goalkeeper in that successful 1994 team skippered by @entity7			1
the president of @entity5 's @entity79 , @entity80 , said of @entity7 : " he was world champion , captain of a world champion side			1
" he has what it takes to lead the @entity5 team			1
the numbers show he absolutely has the ability to take charge			2
" @entity7 spent 60 matches in charge of @entity5 in his first stint as coach between 2006 and 2010 , winning 42 , drawing 12 and losing six			1
he was criticized for the style of play he employed , and the squad he chose to take to @entity95 at the previous @entity4			1
@entity5 was dumped out of the tournament in the last eight after a 2 - 1 defeat to @entity27 , leading to @entity7 's sacking shortly after			1
but arguably , the state of the nation 's soccer is in far worse shape this time around after a chastening experience on home soil			0
ever since @entity5 won the right to host the tournament , its fans wanted the team to erase the memory of the last @entity4 they hosted back in 1950			1
then , they were beaten 2 - 1 by @entity111 in the deciding match , a defeat which provoked a spell of national mourning			2
another was induced by that semifinal mauling			0
shorn of its two best players -- @entity121 striker @entity120 through injury and defender @entity123 because of suspension -- a shellshocked @entity5 were 5 - 0 down at halftime			2
by the end of its 7 - 1 defeat , the crowd were booing them and applauding @entity12			0
many of the players left the field in tears at the final whistle			0
and @entity7 said @entity5 must adapt to the differences in the world game quickly			1
" football has changed , " he added			0
" it changes every moment and every day			0
" we like to talk here about talent and playing off the cuff			0
but we also praise @entity146 organization			0
so we have to harness our talent with planning			0
" @entity7 also made reference to @entity150 , who was a pivotal figure in taking the @entity4 to @entity95 in 2010 before his death in december last year			1
" @entity150 had everything against him , " he said			0
" he did not have a weapon and yet brought about change			0
" i hope to have ( even ) one percent of his patience			0
i am not thinking about me but about the team			0
if the team is doing well then i 'm happy			0
" football : @entity12 captain quits			0
