@entity0 -- is @entity2 becoming a relic , a human version of " @entity5 , " except without the style or cool clothes ? has @entity2 become as dated as @entity8 or " @entity9 ? " all you need to do is look at the bottom line to see that @entity2 is in trouble			1
@entity2 once raked in the big bucks for his radio syndicator , @entity15			1
but last week , @entity15 ceo @entity16 made it clear those days are over			0
@entity16 reported that @entity15 had lost millions of dollars in ad sales because many advertisers no longer want to be associated with @entity2			1
according to @entity16 , advertisers began to pull away from @entity2 after his february 2012 comments in which he infamously called law student @entity22 a " slut " and a " prostitute " after she testified before @entity26 advocating birth control be covered by health insurance			2
@entity2 's despicable comments were met with an avalanche of outrage and calls for corporations to stop advertising on @entity2 's show			1
how badly did this advertising boycott hurt @entity2 's show ? well , according to the radio industry magazine " @entity36 , " 48 of the 50 network advertisers for @entity38 have excluded @entity2 's show from their ad orders			1
i 'm no media expert , but that sounds really bad for @entity2			2
what was @entity2 's response ? was he contrite or remorseful ? nope			1
instead @entity2 lashed out last week at young women again by asserting that the reason ad sales fell off was because : " the media buyers at advertising agencies are young women , fresh out of college - liberal feminists who hate conservatism			2
" not only is this comment sexist on its face , remarkably limbaugh apparently does n't believe that his past antics have contributed to @entity15 ' lost ad sales			0
in fact , a close associate of @entity2 voiced similar sentiments to @entity61 last week , arguing that the loss of ad sales is not because of @entity2 , but because the @entity15 owned radio stations are underperforming when compared with other talk radio stations			2
how did @entity2 get to this place ? times have changed			2
call it being pc or being more sensitive , no one can dispute that what was once acceptable in our society as humor and commentary is no longer			0
@entity2 has a big audience and remains ahead of other talk radio hosts , but the advertisers who abandoned @entity2 appear to be on to something			1
let 's take a quick stroll down memory lane of @entity2 's remarks -- all of which i wish i could have surgically removed from my memory : 1			1
" @entity90 all too often looks like a game between the @entity92 and the @entity93 without any weapons , " a comment @entity2 made while sharing his " insight " on professional football			0
" he is exaggerating the effects of the disease ... it 's purely an act			0
" -- @entity2 mocking actor @entity99 's struggles with @entity100 's			2
@entity2 claimed that president @entity101 was disappointed that @entity102 , which killed 40 people , was n't worse : " @entity101 was hoping this was going to be a disaster as another excuse for his failing economy			2
" forget calling them the @entity110			0
they are now the @entity115 - @entity116 equals racism , " @entity2 's comments defending the smear of @entity113 by right - wing media			1
there are many , many more examples of these " @entity120 " through the years			0
looking at these comments makes you wonder why it took so long for advertisers to wake up and smell the bigotry			0
so what happens if @entity2 is booted from his current syndication deal ? @entity2 will probably find a new home on a lesser terrestrial network or possibly @entity131 radio			1
my hope is that @entity2 ends up as the in - store deejay at a @entity135 in a strip mall in the middle of nowhere			0
but then again , why should those shoppers be subjected to @entity2 's rants ? regardless where he turns up , @entity2 will likely not be as relevant to the national media as he is now			1
all you have to do is look at the career of radio host @entity144			0
@entity144 was fired from @entity146 in 2007 after a national furor erupted over his comments regarding the @entity151 women 's basketball team that were almost universally considered racist and sexist			0
while @entity144 later found a new radio home , he was no longer the same media mover and shaker			0
and while @entity144 is still on five days a week , when is the last time you heard the national media quote @entity144 ? @entity144 may just be @entity2 's " ghost of @entity160 future			1
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity163 .			0

@entity2 and his radio network are at odds
@entity163 says @entity2 's caustic approach has turned off advertisers
he says @entity171 has changed , @entity2 has n't and his time is past
