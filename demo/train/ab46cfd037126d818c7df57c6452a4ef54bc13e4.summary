editor 's note : @entity2 , the former lieutenant governor of @entity3 and daughter of late @entity6 sen. @entity5 , is a former @entity6 deputy assistant attorney general and serves on the board of the @entity8			2
@entity10 , the former mayor of @entity11 , @entity12 , is a @entity13 and president of the @entity8			0
@entity2 says the bloody @entity15 drug war is being fueled by @entity6 guns			1
( @entity17 ) -- @entity6 's neighbor to the south is engaged in a bloody war with ruthless drug cartels			1
it is a war that is threatening to bring down the government of @entity15 , is spilling over into neighborhoods in the @entity6 and is fast becoming a serious national security concern			1
@entity6 gun sellers supply the cartels with 95 to 100 percent of their guns , according to the @entity6 @entity29			1
while the @entity15 drug war has the media and @entity34 abuzz , there has been little mention of our role in supplying the terrorists : we need to realize that the @entity15 drug cartels are arming themselves here because our gun laws have loopholes so large that criminals and gun traffickers can easily drive gun - laden trucks through them			1
@entity15 attorney general @entity46 correctly called @entity6 gun laws " absurd			1
" this crisis is not happening because our border is loose			0
it is happening because our gun laws allow guns to be sold by unlicensed sellers without background checks required by the @entity55 , military - style assault weapons to be freely sold and corrupt gun dealers to thrive			2
we need to prevent @entity15 criminals and the traffickers who supply them from buying guns by changing our gun laws and strengthening @entity6 law enforcement 's ability to crack down on corrupt gun dealers			1
although it is urgent that we help stem the violence in @entity15 , we must realize that the same legal loopholes and corrupt gun sellers that help arm @entity15 criminals also arm @entity6 criminals			1
we should heed the call of @entity15 officials to help stop the violence there , but we also should heed the call of the vast majority of @entity6 to stop the violence in their communities			2
proposals from @entity34 have ignored these central points , instead focusing on border issues , enforcement of current laws and a possible federal ban on assault weapons			0
though helpful , those proposals do not address some other fundamental weaknesses of our gun laws			0
if we want to help the @entity15 people and our own , we must eliminate the loopholes and gaps in federal law that allow guns to be sold without @entity55 background checks by unlicensed sellers			1
the @entity29 has found that gun sales without background checks are a major source for supplying dangerous people with guns			2
under current federal law , only gun sales by a federally licensed gun dealer are subject to @entity55 background checks			0
" private sales " by unlicensed sellers do n't require a background check			2
at gun shows -- sort of like flea markets for firearms -- so - called private sellers sell guns to anyone , no questions asked , except in states that have closed this loophole under state law			2
@entity112 and @entity113 continue to allow private sellers to sell without background checks , and gun shows in those states are one of the sources of guns recovered in @entity15			1
@entity15 drug cartels are exploiting this loophole			1
we all agree that criminals should not be allowed to buy guns			0
we should also agree that all gun sellers should check to make sure they are not arming criminals			0
there is more we should do			0
we must get rid of the riders , known collectively as the @entity131 , attached annually to @entity133 appropriations legislation since 2004			0
these riders weaken enforcement of our laws by prohibiting the @entity29 from releasing gun crime gun data to law enforcement and others , prohibiting the @entity29 from requiring gun dealer inventory audits and requiring the destruction of critical @entity55 background check records within only 24 hours			1
we also should further strengthen the @entity29 by making it easier to revoke the licenses of reckless dealers , give it the power to suspend licenses and levy civil penalties , and eliminate the bizarre restriction that limits the @entity29 to only one spot inspection of a gun dealer per year			0
in addition to strengthening the @entity29 's enforcement power , we need to attack gun trafficking at its source by limiting the high - volume gun sales that fuel trafficking from licensed dealers			0
under federal law , there is no limit to how many handguns or assault weapons a purchaser can buy at a time , allowing gun traffickers to quickly amass guns suitable for an army			0
every year , 30,000 @entity6 are killed with guns , but all too often , @entity34 has ignored the pleas of the vast majority of @entity6 calling for sanity in our gun laws			2
politicians frequently echo the gun lobby refrain to only " enforce the laws on the books , " refusing to admit that there are very few laws on the books			0
but the @entity15 drug war has upped the ante			1
now that our weak gun laws threaten the stability of an important ally , fueling one of our nation 's most ominous global security threats , the question is whether we will strengthen our gun laws to protect @entity15 , and @entity6 , or whether we will cater to the extremist gun lobby			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 and @entity10 .			0

@entity194 , @entity10 : @entity6 guns are helping fuel the @entity15 drug war
they say @entity6 should close loophole letting guns be sold without background check
they say @entity204 should drop limits on federal release of gun data
@entity194 , @entity10 : @entity6 should strengthen powers of federal firearms agency
