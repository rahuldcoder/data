-- for all of our talk of @entity3 being straight shooters who do n't like to mince words and have the freedom of speech to say exactly what 's on our minds , we sure punk out when it comes to elected officials speaking the truth			1
case in point : president @entity14 describing @entity3 corporations as being " lazy " in competing globally			1
now , if you hear that word by itself , you would think , " man , that 's horrible our president said such a thing			2
" but here is exactly what he said during a conversation with @entity27 's ceo as they discussed @entity3 businesses selling more products overseas , and attracting foreign investment to the @entity3 : " you know , we 've been a little bit lazy , i think , over the last couple of decades			1
we 've kind of taken for granted , well , people will want to come here , and we are n't out there hungry selling @entity3 , and trying to attract new businesses into @entity3			1
was he talking about workers turning out cars in @entity42 ? nope			0
was president @entity14 dissing manufacturing workers in @entity45 ? not at all			1
he was talking about @entity3 being far more aggressive in trying to sell our wares abroad			1
then all of a sudden , @entity53 gov. @entity52 used the word in an ad , not even bothering with the context			2
@entity58 anchor @entity57 said @entity14 was " scolding " @entity3			1
@entity62 , never one to let facts get in the way of a good lie , said @entity14 " attacked " @entity3			1
and the king of taking anything out of context , @entity66 , said the president " insults the people who make this country work			1
" seriously , please pass the cup so these folks can take a drug test because they are hallucinating			0
this is the problem with the stubborn belief in @entity3 exceptionalism : it assumes that no matter what the issue , @entity3 are the best in the world and ca n't be topped or beaten			1
there is another word for this : arrogance			0
yes , it 's true			2
@entity3 can be absolutely arrogant when it comes to competing with the rest of the world			2
a few months ago i read a story where @entity3 college students were dismayed that they had to apply for jobs overseas			1
well , if that 's where multinational corporations are hiring , then we might have to learn to get a passport , hop on the plane , and learn how to @entity99 in order to talk to family members			2
are we so arrogant to think the rest of the world is desperate to come here and we may not have to go to other countries ? we ca n't continue to act like our stuff does n't stink			1
there are many areas where @entity3 are lazy , and in the words of president @entity109 , we must end " the soft bigotry of low expectations			1
" maybe this comes from our view of sports			2
it used to be on the national sporting stage , the attitude of @entity3 in gymnastics , boxing , track and field , basketball and numerous other sports was that we could just wake up , walk into a stadium with the @entity3 flag on our chest , and everyone else would faint , allowing us to win			1
well , that ai n't gon na cut it			0
and when we lose , @entity3 totally freak out , wondering how we got beat			2
@entity129 - @entity131 - @entity130 we need a dose of reality at times to remind us that to to be the best , we must have the right work ethic			0
according to the @entity136 : -- 68 % of @entity3 eighth graders ca n't read at grade level and wo n't catch up -- @entity3 students rank 21st in science compared to students in 30 industrialized countries -- @entity3 's top math students rank 25th out of 30 countries in 2000 , the last time @entity147 ranked the top health systems in the world , the @entity3 was 37th , behind @entity150 ( first ) ; @entity151 ( eighth ) ; and @entity152 ( 33rd )			1
maybe part of the problem is the @entity3 culture rewards weakness			2
if @entity3 wants to be the absolute best , we must stop telling our children that they are so exceptional when they are not			1
if your kid ca n't shoot , pass , dribble or rebound , guess what ? they are terrible at basketball and should find a new sport			1
if it 's just about the enjoyment , fine			0
but if it 's about winning , they ca n't cut it			1
i was talking to a @entity0 colleague whose mother is a teacher and she said that her mom ca n't grade papers in red ink anymore because that is considered too aggressive			1
really ? has @entity3 become so weak that we ca n't even handle a school paper graded in red ? i 'm sick of us giving awards at schools just because we do n't want a kid to feel bad			1
guess what ? suck it up			0
first , second and third is fine with me			0
you finished eighth ? tough			0
@entity189 's @entity188 and @entity191 's @entity190 had to apologize because folks complained about them yelling and shouting at their players on the sidelines			0
thank @entity195 @entity196 and @entity197 are dead			0
we would run them out of town ! in @entity204 's excellent book , " @entity205 , " the co-founder of @entity202 is blasted by some for his treatment of workers and competitors			0
was some of @entity205 ' stuff over the top ? sure			0
but what was he trying to do ? he was trying to create a world - class company that could withstand the test of time and was n't filled with a bunch of @entity220 players			0
he wanted excellence in every spot , and would rather fire a b or c player on the spot than accept shoddy work			0
hey , i 'm down with the philosophy of @entity205			0
those are the kind of companies i 've worked for in the past , and i was taught that if you want to win at something , you better be the best			0
@entity234 , even @entity205 was n't above criticizing president @entity14 , saying that one of the reasons he was on his way to a one - term presidency was because , " he 's having trouble leading because he 's reluctant to offend people or piss them off			1
" " yes , that 's not a problem i ever had , " @entity204 quotes @entity205 as saying			0
now that 's some real talk			0
i 'll guarantee you this : weak and lazy corporate bosses allow weak and lazy employees to stick around			0
and weak and lazy employees tend to turn out a weak and sorry product that nobody wants			0
and weak and lazy people accept mediocrity with ease			0
@entity3 , it 's time to suck it up			1
if we love the harsh and in - your - face @entity258 / @entity257 judging of @entity261 , then we should accept it in the real world			0
this nation needs a swift kick in the butt , and there is nothing wrong when president @entity14 says it			2
if house speaker @entity271 said the same , i would be hollering , " amen ! " if @entity3 wants to maintain it 's position as a great nation , then we are going to have to roll up our sleeves and out - think , out - learn , out - hustle and out - work everyone			1
so gov. @entity52 , instead of spending time taking president @entity14 out of context in an ad , you need to work harder in debates			1
@entity282 , you do n't like the president using the word lazy ? then bone up on foreign affairs			2
republicans and @entity288 unhappy with president @entity14 challenging our corporate leaders , stop kicking the can down the road on the tough budget stuff and make a principled , not partisan , call			2
we have been better and can be better			0
so let 's do better			0
