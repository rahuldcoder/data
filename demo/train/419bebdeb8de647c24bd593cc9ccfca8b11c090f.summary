-- a heavily publicized murder trial			1
a parade of con artists , legendary athletes , industrialists and anarchists , radiant movie stars and wearisome politicians			2
and , soaring over all , @entity10			1
they 're all part of " @entity13 : @entity14 , 1927 , " @entity16 's new book about a handful of months of a tumultuous year			1
" it was an extraordinarily crowded summer , " @entity16 says in a phone interview			1
" i think it was the most eventful summer any nation has ever had -- certainly in peacetime			1
" many of the year 's events remain well known : @entity10 's solo flight across the @entity26 , @entity28 's 60 home runs , the debut of the first sound film , " @entity31			1
" others , though less remembered today , echo eerily almost 90 years later			2
in @entity35 , a woman named @entity34 murdered her husband			2
the crime grabbed the attention of the public			2
the trial , which included her lover , dominated news coverage			2
it was nicknamed , of course , " the crime of the century			2
" in @entity50 , @entity47 , a disgruntled farmer named @entity49 murdered his wife and set off a truck full of explosives at the local school , killing 38 students and six adults , including himself			2
it remains the worst school mass murder in @entity60 history			2
in @entity62 , @entity63 , construction workers finished topping out the @entity66 brothers ' masterpiece , @entity67			2
the developers ' structure -- which would be the tallest building in the world outside @entity35 when it opened three years later -- included a railroad station , hotel , department store , restaurants and office building			2
it was also the toppling tip of the @entity66 ' house of cards , a heavily leveraged empire that included railroads and real estate			2
in 1929 they were worth $ 3 billion ; within a few years they would be practically wiped out			2
but perhaps the most fascinating figures in @entity16 's book are the aviators : not just @entity10 , but such now - forgotten figures as @entity88 , @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91			1
at a time when flying was still incredibly risky -- the stuff of air shows and derring - do -- they dared to head across the @entity26 and to other long - distance destinations			2
many did n't make it			2
all too often , @entity16 ends the story of an aviator with the phrase , " he was never heard from again			1
" the @entity103 - based @entity16 , a wry and thoughtful author known for books on the @entity105 ( " @entity106 " ) , the @entity107 ( " @entity108 " ) and the sciences ( the award - winning " @entity110 " ) , spoke to @entity0 from a tour stop in @entity113			1
the following is an edited and condensed version of the interview			0
@entity0 : why this subject ? @entity16 : for a long time , i 'd been vaguely fascinated by the idea that @entity10 flew the @entity26 and @entity28 hit 60 home runs in the same summer			1
i wondered if it was possible to do a dual biography of these two iconic figures			0
but when i started doing the research , i quickly discovered that though @entity10 and @entity28 were important elements of the summer of 1927 , they were only part of it			1
and that became the story			0
@entity0 : what struck you about this summer ? it seems the biggest broad - shouldered year of an energetic decade			1
there were so many things that i 'd only barely ever heard of -- or not heard of at all			0
certain events that were so momentous i ca n't believe i 'd never heard of them			0
the one that leaps out is the madman in @entity47 who blew up the school			0
i 'd never heard of this at all			0
the problem was he did it on may 19 , 1927 , and the very next day @entity10 flew to @entity149 and it knocked everything off the front pages			1
@entity0 : why was @entity10 the through line ? @entity16 : i did n't realize just how momentous ( @entity10 's flight ) was , and how it gripped the whole world			1
and @entity10 was far and away the most enigmatic and most fascinating ( character )			1
just imagine if you were 25 years old and suddenly , overnight , became the most famous man on the planet			0
and not just famous and celebrated , but people are regarding you as a kind of savior			0
in this painfully symbolic way you 've descended from heaven and people are treating you almost as if you 've come to save the @entity165			0
but soon afterwards he turned quite ugly and became this great @entity169 sympathizer and very much @entity170 and @entity171 as the second @entity172 came along , and a very , very much less attractive person			1
he was a very hard person to get a grasp of			0
@entity0 : i enjoy the way you draw connections between things -- people who crossed paths at the time , and events that resonate down through today			0
@entity16 : i painted myself into a corner by writing a whole book on this one period			1
the summer of 1927 came to an end , but nothing else did -- all of these peoples ' lives went on			1
i suddenly found myself in this position of writing an epilogue , and you 're supposed to be wrapping things up , but you 're actually condensing long and busy lives into a paragraph or two			0
@entity0 : but even the quick brush strokes -- the @entity66 , for example			0
they could be the overextended moguls of today			0
@entity16 : it did strike me that the @entity66 were not really all that different from @entity201 ( who makes a cameo appearance in " @entity13 " )			1
the only real difference was that @entity201 was an out - and - out fraudster			0
but the @entity66 -- their whole empire was built on exactly the same kind of sleight of hand , and looking a lot more sturdy and wealthy than they really were			0
it was all based on inflating things and building these pyramids -- not unlike @entity201			0
@entity0 : the society was also more rural , and there did n't seem to be the same fear of death			0
@entity16 : that was what struck me again and again with the aviators			1
they were doing the most hair - raising , dangerous things			0
after @entity10 's flight , @entity88 was persuaded to be the first person to take off from a ship			1
and he admits just before he does n't know how to swim ! you think , was this guy a complete fool , or was he really that brave ? and i think it was a mixture of both			0
the idea of getting in those planes flying around your own town was scary enough , but getting in them and trying to fly across an empty ocean without any navigation equipment was unbelievable			0
and yet you look at pictures of them as they 're climbing in the planes and they look as confident as they would as if they were going to the grocery store			0
@entity0 : how do you go about picking your subjects ? @entity16 : it 's always a combination of things			1
the basic challenge of any book is you know you 're going to be working on it for three or four years or more			1
so you want to have a subject that will keep you engaged			0
but then i have to factor in practicalities -- how much travel will this involve , can i make this appeal to @entity261 - speaking audiences			0
these are not things you can always resolve , but you have to take them into account			0
with " @entity267 " ( @entity16 's history of residences ) i promised my wife i would spend my time at home			1
i had done a lot of traveling , and i told her i would do something where i could go to a library all day and come back for dinner every night			0
and it occurred to me , what if i did a history of the world but from the perspective of my own house ? this one , since i live abroad , i do get hankerings to come home sometime and reconnect with @entity14			1
i like to do books in which a lot of the research and the writing and the thinking revolves around something @entity60			1
so that was indulging my homesickness , and a very , very longstanding desire to write something about baseball			0
@entity0 : do you take the time you spend on planes and ponder the aviators you wrote about ? @entity16 : it 's hard not to ! i urge you to go to the @entity300 and just look at these little planes			1
i was standing with one of the curators and you can see that ( @entity10 's plane ) , the @entity304 is just fabric			1
i asked how sturdy was it ? could you poke a hole in it with your finger ? and he said yes			0
you could demolish the @entity304 with your bare hands in about a minute and a half			0
it 's just amazing .			1
