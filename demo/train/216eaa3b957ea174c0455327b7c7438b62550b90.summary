-- you do n't get any prizes for guessing that @entity3 is the highest - earning female athlete in the world			0
but who is the second richest ? is it @entity7 , the @entity9 13 - time grand slam winner ? or is it @entity11 , the world no. 1 and winner of 35 of her 38 matches this year ? and away from tennis , there is @entity16 , the only woman to win an @entity18 race and a big drawcard for motorsport sponsors			1
in fact , it is @entity23 , the world no. 7 women 's tennis player and winner of a single grand slam title in a 13 - year career			1
but that surprise victory at the @entity31 almost a year ago transformed @entity23 into one of the world 's most marketable athletes			1
according to @entity35 , she earned $ 18 million to april 2012 ( up $ 10 million from 2011 ) -- $ 8 million shy of @entity3 's total but $ 5 million more than third - placed @entity7			1
so why are brands scrambling to associate with @entity23 , who will defend her title at @entity31 when the clay - court major starts on sunday			1
" two words : she 's @entity47 , " says @entity42 , professor of sport business strategy and marketing at @entity44 in @entity45			2
" @entity23 is out there on her own , firstly in terms of being a female @entity47 sportsperson and secondly in terms of her international profile and success			1
" the fact that @entity23 plays tennis -- a traditionally middle - class sport -- is also in her favor			2
" @entity47 has now become the biggest market for luxury brands in the world and there is this kind of convergence between luxury brands and tennis , " @entity42 told @entity0			1
" the kind of people who are interested in those brands are also interested in tennis , so @entity23 is a very convenient way of aligning the two			1
" @entity23 's agent @entity69 , who also represents @entity3 , spotted the potential in 2009 when he signed her to @entity72 's books			2
he concedes that although he thought she had top - five potential , he did n't necessarily expect her to be a grand slam winner			0
but at age 29 , and in her 20th major tournament , @entity23 beat @entity77 to become the first @entity47 player to win a grand slam singles title and set off a chain of events that had @entity69 working overnight from a makeshift office to stay in touch with his colleagues in @entity86 while the offers flooded in			1
" she 's basically the @entity88 of @entity47 , " @entity69 told @entity0			2
" she broke down so many barriers			0
" she was the first -- and it 's weird that you can say that in 2012 -- that there 's somewhere in the world that they just do n't have a rich tradition of sports heroes			0
" i think that was very cool to see : that the win was a lot bigger than tennis			0
" @entity23 has signed seven new sponsorship deals since her @entity31 triumph			1
among them are luxury car maker @entity104 and @entity47 insurance company @entity105 @entity69 even managed to negotiate a special deal with @entity107 to allow @entity23 to wear patches on her clothing -- something not usually permitted by the @entity9 sportswear giant			2
" i think we did a good job on a hybrid of global brands that could potentially use @entity23 to help get a footing in @entity47 and then we also wanted to associate with some great @entity47 brands , " he said			1
@entity69 estimates they could have signed up to seven more deals , but with his experience of managing @entity3 's money - making potential after her 2004 @entity123 win , he was wary of compromising @entity23 's tennis career			1
@entity23 won only six more matches in 2011 after the @entity31 final , going out in the second round at @entity123 and the first hurdle at the @entity129			1
she has been more like her old self in 2012 , reaching two finals , most recently at the @entity132 where she lost out to @entity3 over three sets			0
" i liked the way i hit on court , " she said afterwards			0
" a lot of positive things and i think i am ready for the @entity31			0
" the reality is that financially at least , it really does n't matter how @entity23 performs at @entity31 this time around			2
she was already nearing the end of her career when she won the title and the deals were negotiated with that in mind			0
what @entity72 and @entity23 's team has done is what @entity42 calls " short - term harvesting			0
" " it 's to make as much money as possible in the period of time they 've got left before she retires , " said the academic			0
" the @entity31 was all she needed because we 're still talking about it now , that 's proof that 's all she needed			0
" which begs the question : would any @entity47 player have had the same earning potential as @entity23 had they become the first major winner from the world 's most populous country ? maybe not			1
@entity42 says @entity23 's added value comes from the fact that she rejected the @entity47 state - run sports system , while @entity69 describes as her " little bit of rebel			2
" that little bit of rebelliousness is most visible in the red rose tattoo she sports on her chest			0
" in @entity177 terms , marketers talk about brand personality , " @entity42 said			0
" and she does have some personality to her , the whole thing about her tattoo , the crazy things she says about her husband ( who @entity23 has publicly berated for his snoring )			0
" " effectively what @entity23 does is give these @entity177 brands a direct route into the @entity47 marketplace , which is a notoriously difficult and complex country to do business in			1
" @entity23 joked in august last year that she still used her husband @entity184 's credit card when she went shopping because she liked to save money			2
if @entity184 ever needs a loan to pay off the bill , he need look no further than his multimillionaire wife .			0
