-- two bananas thrown on a football pitch , separated by 26 years			1
one thrown at @entity3 in 1988 in an @entity5 soccer match and another at @entity6 in 2014 during a @entity8 league game			1
throwing fruit to racially taunt players in their place of work			1
@entity3 kicked it away during the @entity16 derby between @entity17 and @entity18 , @entity13 star @entity6 picked it up and ate it in sunday 's match against @entity22			1
does it show how ineffective sport 's ongoing fight against racism has been , or as one leading ex-player argues , does the @entity29 's quick thinking demonstrates just how far football has come in 26 years			1
" in the 1980s , players were n't taking a stance , " former @entity33 player and current trustee of anti-racism campaign group @entity31 , @entity36 , told @entity0			1
" they 're doing it now			0
" @entity3 kicks it out of the way , @entity6 picks it up and eats it			1
in a show of defiance , it 's his way of saying how stupid this is			0
that is all it signifies			0
" there 's a real message in there to the idiots , if they can see it			0
to the intelligent and educated , they will think we should n't have to endure that type of behavior in our football club			0
there 's no place for it here			0
" @entity13 full - back @entity67 , who posted a clip of the incident on @entity70 , is not the first player to ignore the taunts @entity73 walked off the pitch in 2013 after being abused by opposition fans during an @entity77 game in @entity78 , while other leading players like @entity81 's @entity80 , @entity82 of @entity83 and @entity77 's @entity84 have all taken their own stances against racist abuse			1
social media reaction but it was @entity6 ' response that struck a chord on social media , with the @entity29 's @entity13 teammate @entity93 's vociferous in support of his club and international colleague			1
" they 're all prepared to say , stop you better do something about this or i walk , " added @entity36			1
" it 's challenging football to do something about a problem that it has found difficult to do something about in the past			0
" it will focus the supporters ' minds [ by players making a stance ] and make them ask questions of themselves			1
" these days anti-racism campaign groups -- such as @entity113 -- are around to pressurize the football authorities when players like @entity6 are abused			1
and such has been the progress in the fight against racist abuse that , according to one of the legends of the game , what happened to @entity6 at the @entity123 remains an isolated incident			1
" i think if you mention that , it is ridiculous , as you have one case , and all over the world they play soccer , and you have one case , " @entity126 legend @entity125 told @entity0			1
you have a lot of other problems , a lot of criminals			0
but in football , you have one crazy guy who says bad things			0
" some might express surprise at @entity125 's comments -- given that both @entity17 's @entity144 and @entity83 's @entity145 have been found guilty by @entity5 's @entity146 of racially abusing an opponent in recent high profile cases in @entity5			1
" i think @entity125 is right to say it is an isolated incident , but i think he is wrong to make that isolated incident any less important than it is , " countered @entity36			1
" it 's embarrassed not just an international player , but a top @entity8 club [ @entity22 ] and the entire @entity154			0
" it 's all around the world , we 're all taking about it			2
top players are eating bananas and taking the mickey out of , not just the incident , but of @entity22 and the @entity8 federation [ @entity93 's campaign ]			1
they 're mocking them , it 's embarrassing			0
" although @entity22 moved swiftly to hand a life ban to the fan responsible for throwing the banana at @entity6 , the @entity154 has yet to make a decision on the case			1
the @entity173 this week , in contrast , gave @entity175 owner @entity174 a life ban over racist remarks he made just days earlier			2
in the past neither world governing body @entity179 or @entity181 's regulator @entity180 have shown a willingness to act so decisively in dealing with racist abuse			0
given this is not the first time that @entity6 has been racially abused , the @entity29 argued sunday 's incident shone an unflattering spotlight on @entity8 society			1
" there is racism against foreigners			0
they sell the country as being first world but in certain things they are very backward , " @entity6 told @entity126 's @entity191			2
" if i could , i would put a photo of the fan on the internet so that he would be shamed			0
" @entity67 ' suggestion that @entity154 is " backward " touches on the nub of the problem , according to @entity36			2
" football clubs are being left with the responsibility of educating their fans , and quite frankly that should have started years ago at school and in people 's forms of employment , " he said			2
" how dare football fans , however isolated , come to someone 's place of employment , whether it be entertainment or otherwise , and want to abuse other people 's heroes			2
" to @entity125 , though , such abuse is only to be expected , given that some people in this world are always going to be less educated than others			2
" i think it should be like that , as of course you have different people all over the world , " he said			0
" you must respect the people that do n't have the intelligence , or the people who want to make confusion , or people who want to create problems			0
that , i think , is normal			0
" not , however , in @entity36 ' eyes			2
" @entity125 accepted the situation [ of racial abuse ] as a player , as i did			2
he did n't have to play , he chose to play			0
he accepted the terms and conditions of his employment , " he said			0
" but there are players today who are not , and i think it 's really important that we all understand that			2
" @entity249 : stars show solidarity with @entity67			0
