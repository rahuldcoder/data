-- it is a gruesome scene , even in a country that has seen its share of violence : three men , beheaded , with wounds peppering their bodies on all sides			1
the most surprising part ? the attack happened inside a jail			2
a @entity13 newspaper on tuesday released a video of this stomach - turning scene inside the @entity17 jail in @entity13 's northeastern state of @entity19			1
the video was recorded on december 17 , the @entity21 newspaper reported , describing how " other prisoners pose with the bodies , showing them off like trophies			2
" a union of jail workers gave the gory footage to the newspaper			1
many will view the video simply for the shock value , but behind this incident is a myriad of problems in the @entity13 penal system that allow an environment where something like this could unfold			1
the @entity17 jail was already under scrutiny even before the video was made public			2
a judge visited the jail just days after the decapitations and wrote a report demanding that the state government regain control of the inmate population			0
in all , 62 inmates were killed inside @entity17 in 2013			0
the judge , @entity48 , also documented violence against women , saying that female visitors were forced to have sex with the leaders of gangs inside the prison			0
" the relatives of the powerless prisoners inside the jail are paying this price so that they wo n't be murdered , " @entity48 told @entity13 's judicial news agency			1
" it is a serious violation of human rights			0
" overcrowding is also a problem at this jail			0
there are 2,196 inmates at @entity17 , which was built to hold only 1,770 , according to state jail officials			0
at the root of the violence at @entity17 is fighting between two rival factions -- inmates from the state 's capital , and inmates from the interior of the state			1
in response , the federal government this week reached an agreement with the state to transfer the leaders of these warring factions to federal prisons , the state - run @entity79 news agency reported			0
the woes at @entity17 are not unique to @entity19 state			0
overcrowding and violence in jails are a problem in other parts of @entity13 , as well as throughout @entity95			1
