editor 's note : @entity2 was a star pitcher for the @entity3 and won the @entity4 as the @entity6 's best pitcher in 1996			1
he is second all - time with 15 post-season wins and will be doing color commentary on @entity10 's baseball playoff coverage that gets under way wednesday			1
baseball 's post-season starts wednesday with six of the eight playoff teams facing off in best - of - five series			1
first up , the @entity16 travel to @entity17 to take on the @entity18			2
later wednesday , the defending @entity6 champion @entity21 host the @entity22 , and the defending @entity24 champion @entity19 open a defense of their title against the @entity27 in @entity28			1
the @entity29 and @entity3 open their @entity30 on thursday			1
@entity2 , who was an eight - time all - star and pitched in the major leagues for more than 20 years , spoke to @entity33 about what to watch when you tune in the games			1
@entity33 : who are half - dozen or so players that even the casual baseball fan will enjoy watching in the playoffs ? @entity2 : a couple of the young players come to mind			1
in the @entity6 , we have @entity46 , a rookie catcher handling a veteran pitching staff for the @entity29			2
it will be interesting to see how he does			2
in that same series , @entity49 from the @entity3 , a young phenom , is in the playoffs in his first season			1
it does n't happen too often that two rookies are expected to lead their teams like @entity46 and @entity49 are			2
for people who do n't know a lot about the @entity22 , @entity56 is an exciting player who has put up incredibly great offensive numbers ( .324 batting average , 37 home runs , 113 rbi )			1
it will be interesting to see how he fares against @entity66 's three - headed pitching monster ( star pitchers @entity67 , @entity69 and @entity70 )			2
@entity71 of @entity18 is an exciting player who is fun to watch			2
he can steal bases , hit for power and plays tremendous defense in the outfield			0
there 's going to be the question mark for the @entity19 : can @entity78 return from his injury to dominance of the post-season where he 's won more games than any other pitcher ? [ @entity2 is second			1
] and @entity28 has all kinds of great stories			0
their starting pitcher in the first game , @entity86 , was coming off an injury , and in spring training did n't even know if he 'd make the roster			0
and here [ he ] is starting game one			0
@entity33 : there were some blown calls by umpires last post-season			1
will we see more use of replay ? @entity2 : there wo n't be any more replays being used [ than last year ]			1
replay will only be used for home - run calls , fair or foul			1
my opinion is eventually we get to the point where at least in post-season , replay is used only when a run would be affected			2
so if there 's a runner on third , and on an infield chopper , a guy looks like he is safe but they call him out , i think that would be reviewable since a run [ was ] scored			0
a trapped ball with two outs and a man on third would be the same thing			0
those are the kind of things that could really affect the outcome of a game and would be a reviewable component if a run crosses home plate			0
that 's why they do it for a home run , because a run is affected			0
@entity33 : has the style of the game changed in recent years , either due to more stringent steroid testing or for other reasons ? @entity2 : the style of the game has drastically changed			1
it 's become a more specialized game , and what i mean by that is more pitchers are being used per game , which makes hitting that much more difficult because you 're facing specialist guys who can throw 90 to 96 miles per hour coming out of the bullpen			0
that has been a big component that has changed strategy			0
starting pitchers do n't pitch as long anymore , and relief pitchers pitch to one , two or three batters at a time			0
i also think the confidence of the hitters has been impacted by the steroid stuff and has contributed to the lack of home runs			0
@entity33 : does home field matter ? @entity2 : i would argue it always matters			1
i know statistics may show differently , but home field should matter			0
imagine if in football you always got the ball last in the fourth quarter no matter what the score was			0
that would have an impact			0
in baseball , you bat last , which means there should be a strategic advantage , not to mention your home - team crowd should serve you well			2
the best - of - five series [ the round one format ] is more of a coin flip			2
the first game of a best - of - five means a lot more than a game one in best - of - seven [ the format for the league championship and @entity24 ]			0
there is more time to recover in a best - of - seven than a best - of - five			0
the pressure in best - of - five reduces the chances of [ the ] best team winning			2
@entity33 : which manager can most directly impact the game and steal a win for his team ? @entity2 : @entity202 of the @entity3 has done his greatest managing job of his career			1
just getting there has been an incredible testament to his patience and will and ability to put his team in position			0
@entity210 of the @entity18 has uncanny and well - thought - out theories that he applies and has his team do			0
... without knowing a whole lot , i 'd give the nod to @entity210			0
@entity33 : what would surprise you most this post-season ? @entity2 : the @entity3 winning their series against the @entity29 , just because they ran out of gas and have sustained too many injuries			1
that and @entity22 knocking off @entity66 , who is heavily favored			1
@entity33 : what 's your prediction on who wins the @entity24 ? @entity2 : @entity66 beats @entity18 in a close series .			1

@entity2 says to keep eye on young players leading their teams in baseball playoffs
he says there should be more use of replay to *correct* umpires ' calls
@entity2 says the @entity3 and @entity22 winning their series would be the biggest surprise to him
