but the two sides had more in common than it would appear , said @entity21 , president of the @entity22			1
" it was thrilling to be in @entity9 , just plain old thrilling , " said @entity21			1
... we spoke the same language , the language of movies			0
" in @entity9 , " the language of movies " has thrived since the @entity28 , despite strict censorship laws , said @entity33 professor @entity32 , author of " @entity34 : @entity35			2
" a number of post-revolution @entity9 films have screened at international film festivals , and some , such as @entity40 's " @entity39 , " have won international awards			1
creativity and prohibition often have an " intimate relationship , " @entity32 said , observing that " film cultures have flourished oftentimes when they have been under restrictions			0
" @entity9 's film association , known as the @entity49 , was host of the @entity4 trip			1
the @entity16 delegation , which included @entity21 , producer @entity54 and actress @entity15 , took part in a cultural dialogue with prominent @entity9 screenwriters , actors and directors , sharing their ideas on filmmaking and taking part in workshops and film screenings			1
" it 's hard to get @entity9 films distributed in @entity9 because ... there are n't that many cinemas , " @entity21 said			1
" and then , of course , the government intrudes on the process with a certain censorship set of rules and [ regulations ]			0
" but , citing a recent @entity9 film called " about @entity77 , " directed by @entity78 -- scheduled to be screened at this year 's @entity79 -- @entity21 said @entity9 filmmakers are still able to release high - quality films			1
" we are expecting the @entity9 film industry to continue to flourish in terms of the creativity that we saw when we were there , " @entity21 said			1
" at the moment , i think [ @entity9 cinema ] does have wide exposure , " @entity32 said			0
" i do think that @entity9 filmmakers are already thinking about the foreign market			2
" ironically , things were different before the revolution , @entity32 said			0
@entity9 cinema generally emulated @entity16 film instead of finding its own niche , which did n't endear it to a number of @entity9			2
" @entity9 melodrama from the 1960s and 1970s replicates @entity16 melodrama , " she said			0
" what the [ @entity101 did was to make a commodity of women ... make them wear @entity107 fashion and become alien to @entity9			0
" the @entity108 has also enforced constraints on the film industry with its requirement of modesty , @entity32 said			1
but @entity9 cinema has actually had its greatest artistic success in recent years , taking on issues raised by the 1979 revolution and the @entity116 of the 1980s			0
the impact of those events " has created a condition of creativity to express the trauma that the nation has experienced , " said @entity118 iranian studies professor @entity117			0
" this is not in defense of censorship , obviously , " @entity117 added , but when it comes to @entity9 , censorship " creates a creative barrier that filmmakers have to cross			1
" @entity54 , a producer who worked with @entity9 actors on the set of " @entity134 , " said that members of the @entity49 did not openly discuss the government 's policies , although censorship is " a real issue for them			2
" " it 's a paradox that cinema there is known for its ultra-realism and ultra-naturalism and that feeling like you 're not even watching a movie , you 're watching life			0
but a lot of what they 're able to dramatize is limited , " @entity54 said			0
despite their limitations , filmmakers have raised @entity9 cinema to new heights , winning awards and critics ' praise across the globe			2
officially , @entity9 's citizens are unable to watch a number of these films , including director @entity163 's films " @entity166 " ( 2006 ) and " circle " ( 2000 ) , which address women 's rights , and @entity40 's award - winning " @entity39 , " which deals with suicide			1
all are banned inside the country			1
but that does n't stop @entity9 moviegoers from seeing the films			2
" when a film is banned , people are even more eager to see it , " @entity117 said , pointing out that many @entity9 acquire films through the black market			1
" the @entity9 audience is among the most appreciative audience for film anywhere , " said @entity54			2
" they seem to have seen everything			0
" people outside the country are also eager for the country 's production and talent			0
@entity117 said @entity9 cinema has been prominent on the international scene for years , adding that many @entity9 actors are beginning to cross over to the @entity191 -- from veteran @entity9 film actress @entity192 , who starred opposite @entity193 in 2003 's " @entity194 , " to newcomer @entity195 , who starred as @entity197 's love interest in the 2008 thriller " @entity199			1
" @entity9 's @entity49 was enthusiastic about the @entity4 delegation 's visit , according to @entity203 correspondent @entity202			1
" this was very special to them , " @entity202 said			0
" they 're the best in the business in @entity9 and what i did see was that connection and camaraderie between filmmakers			2
... you can tell that all of them were in their element and they spoke the universal language of film and television			0
" the @entity9 government did n't seem to share the excitement			0
shortly after the delegation 's arrival , @entity221 , the arts adviser to @entity9 president @entity222 , said the @entity22 representatives should apologize for @entity4 's depiction of @entity9 through the years			1
citing films like " 300 " and 1991 's " @entity228 , " @entity221 said @entity4 has repeatedly attacked @entity9			1
but , @entity21 said , " we were there to talk to filmmakers , not to get into politics and the rhetoric of problems that exist or are perceived to exist between the two countries			2
" @entity21 added that he hopes the visit will help relations between @entity9 and the @entity16			2
" it 's a start , " @entity21 said			0
