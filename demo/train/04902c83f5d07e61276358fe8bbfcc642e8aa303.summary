-- when you think about the images typically associated with hunger , a recreation of the @entity6 's tea party from " @entity7 " might not spring to mind			2
but one @entity10 nonprofit is using recreated scenes from popular movies , musicals and tv shows to get people talking about poverty and hunger			1
the @entity19 group @entity18 provides food to children , the elderly , people with disabilities and terminally ill patients			0
looking for an edgy way to raise awareness about poverty and hunger in the local community , the group turned to @entity32 , a photographer and long - time friend of many of the board members of the nonprofit			1
@entity32 conceptualized the community art project @entity38 , which combines food with images of iconic films , musicals and tv shows to get people talking about hunger and poverty			1
images like @entity48 savagely biting into a blood - red slice of red velvet or @entity51 trying to hold down a white dress of splashing milk are meant to provoke people to question the message behind them , said @entity32 , who served as creative director			1
" i want the images to first seem obvious , but then get the viewer to stop and take a second , deeper look to connect the purpose behind the photos , " he said			0
@entity32 was inspired by the global art project " @entity72 " started by @entity65 photographer @entity64 , who wanted to get people talking about social issues like poverty , hunger and homelessness through large wall postings			1
with a grant from the @entity74 , @entity32 and a small group of volunteer photographers and models were able to afford the props , food , sets and printing costs needed to create the images of lavish decadence			2
the shoots took several weeks to organize and produce			0
they mostly chose scenes from films that already had food in them , but took creative license with the images inspired by " @entity92 , " " @entity93 " and " @entity94			1
" the collection is n't intended to portray hunger , he said , but to raise awareness about the organization 's efforts			0
the pictures will be displayed on the side of the appetite 4 life building in early april for four weeks before they travel to local galleries , starting with the @entity105 at @entity106			2
while the images are meant to raise awareness more than money , @entity18 has received offers from people interested in buying the photos			2
the organization is considering making the images available to purchase , with all of the proceeds going to support the organization			0
@entity117 , founder and ceo of the national hunger nonprofit @entity119 , said organizations need to get creative to get people to pay attention to hunger and poverty , perennial issues			1
" data speaks to a person 's mind ; emotion speaks to their heart , " @entity117 said			0
" creativity is the bridge between the two			0
the more creative the communication , the more likely people will notice and be willing to give of themselves			0
