-- " @entity1 " is @entity2 doing what he should have done a long time ago : making a tricky , amoral , down - and - dirty crime thriller that 's blessedly free of any social , topical or political relevance			1
how liberated from an agenda is this movie ? it 's about two marijuana dealers in @entity10 who run afoul of a @entity13 drug cartel , and the film has nothing at all to say about either undocumented immigrants or the war on drugs			1
yet you can feel how alive @entity2 is to the material			0
he stamps every scene with his darkly combustible cinematic personality			0
based on a novel by @entity24 , " @entity1 " is grandiose underworld pulp staged with screw - tightening skill and a taste for nasty kicks that spills over into sadism and dread			1
it 's like a jacked - up " @entity32 " told from the point of view of the criminals			1
the film is narrated , in a " @entity37 " - meets - " @entity39 " way , by @entity40 ( @entity41 ) , known as @entity42 , a free - spirited @entity44 blonde who lives with , and loves , two guys and is their anything - goes siren - goddess			2
@entity50 ( @entity49 ) , a scarred , sexy hunk of an @entity53 war vet , is the tougher and more volatile of the men			0
his friend and business partner , the gentler @entity57 ( @entity58 ) , is a wispy - bearded nihilist hippie			2
the two went into the drug game together with a crop of '' primo '' marijuana seeds that @entity50 smuggled back from @entity53 after enlisting in the military for that purpose			1
they 've harvested those seeds into a greenhouse crop that yields weed with @entity70 levels of 33 % ( the best high anyone 's ever had )			2
but the popularity of their product threatens the cartel 's business , which is why the gangsters come calling like a vicious corporation that talks '' partnership '' when it means '' hostile takeover			1
'' run by a ruthless matriarch ( @entity83 ) from her hacienda , the cartel issues a warning in the form of a creepy internet video of a dungeon full of freshly decapitated victims			1
but @entity50 and @entity57 are too arrogant to know what they 're dealing with			0
so the gangsters kidnap @entity42 and place her in the dungeon , where they threaten to hack off her fingers			0
" @entity1 " is violent enough to risk turning off a portion of the audience			1
yet even as the movie descends into blood - spattered exploitation , it 's revving up the suspense			1
when characters are threatened with stuff this brutal , you 'd better believe there 's something at stake			2
to get o back , @entity50 and @entity57 must become masterminds and warriors			0
they have to descend into savagery themselves			0
@entity2 presents some bravura set pieces , from a pulse - quickening encounter with a highway cop to an incendiary multivehicle heist to every scene with @entity120 as a very scary sociopath			2
as for @entity49 , he wipes away any lingering @entity122 cobwebs with his explosive performance , and @entity124 is funny and desperate as a @entity126 agent up to his ears in slime			0
exciting as it is , " @entity1 " does slide off the rails during the last half hour			1
the film goes from intense to indulgent , plausible to preposterous			0
but it 's still a pleasure to see @entity2 settle into this dark groove			2
