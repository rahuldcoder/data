@entity1 -- @entity6 told @entity1 's @entity7 that @entity8 wanted to play the title role in the film version of " @entity11			1
" according to @entity6 , the @entity8 came to see the @entity12 show multiple times -- years before the film came out -- and he and @entity8 had spoken about a potential " @entity11 " movie role			1
however , @entity6 said , " people in those days were very worried that a film , if it was made , would destroy the @entity12 or the @entity20 show , and everybody would just go and see the movie			1
in fact , it 's been proven to be completely the other way around			2
if you make a movie , it 's just a great help for the theater			2
but goodness knows what it would 've been like			0
" the seven - time @entity33 - winning , four - time @entity35 - winning composer of musicals including " phantom , " " @entity38 , " " @entity39 " and " @entity40 , " among others , is a guest on friday 's " @entity5			0
" @entity6 also recalled another legend who had an interest in portraying the @entity11 -- @entity45 recalled being introduced to @entity46 by @entity47 while in the south of @entity49			1
" i have never felt so ashamed in my life , " said @entity6 , who said he was skeptical about @entity46 ' ability to fill the role at first			2
" for 2Â½ hours i heard one of the most consummate performances i 've ever heard , and he ended up doing ' @entity55			0
' " @entity6 told @entity7 he had hoped to get @entity46 to open the production on the @entity58 stage but it did not work out			1
@entity6 also told @entity7 the story of how " @entity11 , " which is billed as the most successful musical of all time , came to be			1
@entity6 's fiancee at the time , performer @entity63 , had been offered a role in a theatrical farce based on the " @entity11 " novel by @entity67			1
several months later , @entity6 bought a used copy of the novel at a book fair in @entity70			2
today , @entity6 's musical version of " @entity11 " is coming up on its 25th anniversary			1
a celebration concert in @entity74 is planned			0
the musical that catapulted @entity6 and lyricist @entity76 to fame , " @entity40 , " was called " blasphemous " when it hit the stage in the 1970s			1
" we never wrote ' superstar ' to be in any way shocking , " said @entity6			2
" we wrote it because we wanted to write the story of the man			0
and in fact , we really wanted to write a love triangle , because the whole thing was -- did @entity88 have @entity89 on his side ? " @entity7 pointed out the irony of " @entity40 " causing a controversy when " @entity93 " -- a musical that takes a cynical look at faith -- has just won multiple @entity33			0
@entity6 also told @entity7 that " superstar 's " breakout song , " @entity99 , " was originally entitled " @entity100			1
" when @entity7 suggested that narrative was the key to the longevity of his productions , @entity6 agreed , and pointed out that " @entity38 " was a " collection of poems by @entity107 about cats that he wrote for his godchildren			2
well , that was quite different , and we stitched them together with a vague story that we discovered that his widow had that he wrote , which was a sort of , forgive the pun , cat 's cradle			0
" @entity6 told @entity7 that the moment in his career that remains in his mind the most and that he would re-live if possible is actress @entity122 's performance of the song " memory " on opening night of " @entity38 " on @entity12			1
@entity6 's current project is a stage revival of " @entity127 " he and lyricist @entity76 have written several new songs for the production , which will also include the songs from the film			1
the musical will star @entity133 in the title role			0
a longtime colleague of @entity6 's , @entity133 originated the @entity11 role on stage			1
when @entity7 asked @entity6 why he selected " @entity141 , " and how he knew it would fare well with a modern audience , the composer said , " the trick with those is you 've got to find a character to cast that the public knows			2
" and of course , the role of @entity148 is something that everybody knows			0
and that 's why we started with that			0
but interestingly with ' @entity141 , ' it 's never really worked in the theater before			0
and we looked at it very carefully , and came to the conclusion that what people had been trying to do was to stage the film , whereas what you really had to do is to go back and rethink it			0
" @entity6 said if he were casting his all - time " dream " musical , it would star @entity166 , but of all the people he 's worked with in real life , @entity167 as @entity168 in his production of " @entity170 " would be the hardest act to follow			1
