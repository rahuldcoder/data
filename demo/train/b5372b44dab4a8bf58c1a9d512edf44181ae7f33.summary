-- @entity1 announced an ambitious slate of launches wednesday aimed at putting new eyes on the @entity5 and its atmosphere in 2014			1
a total of five missions -- three satellites and two instruments that will be mounted on the @entity13 -- are scheduled to go into orbit between february and november , the @entity8 space agency said			1
they 'll measure carbon dioxide in the air , water in the soil , rainfall , cloud layers and ocean winds , providing " immediately useful " readings that will help improve both short - term weather forecasts and and long - term climate projections , said @entity26 , the director of @entity1 's @entity27			2
" this tremendous suite of five new instruments and missions that will be launching this year will truly reinvigorate our observing system and expand it , " @entity26 said			1
the launches come two years after the @entity34 warned that budget pressure , program delays and launch failures had left scientists facing a " rapid decline " in @entity5 observations as the @entity8 satellite fleet aged			2
@entity1 had called that 2012 report " overly pessimistic			2
" @entity26 said wednesday that six more missions were ready to launch by the end of the decade , including satellites that help measure the dynamics of the polar ice sheets and measure human use of water in aquifers			2
the first of this year 's planned launches , the @entity54 , is set for february 27			0
the satellite will be launched from @entity56 in a joint venture with that country 's space agency , @entity1 said			2
a second satellite , the @entity61 , is slated to go up in july from @entity62 , in @entity63			0
its mission is to monitor the levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide blamed for rising global temperatures -- a controversial notion politically , but one accepted as fact by most scientists			0
the first @entity61 mission crashed into the sea in 2009 after failing to reach orbit			0
and in november , @entity1 hopes to launch its @entity76 satellite , designed to produce high - resolution maps of water in the soil			1
that can help track droughts and improve the productivity of farmland , the agency says			0
meanwhile , the two missions headed for the space station will be carried aloft by the private space contractor @entity88 , which began flying commercial cargo missions in 2013			1
the @entity90 , which will record ocean winds -- important data for marine forecasts , hurricane tracking and climate research -- goes up on a @entity88 mission june 6			0
the @entity97 , which uses laser instruments to track small particles in the atmosphere , is scheduled for launch september 12			0
the @entity105 administration 's recent decision to support the space station through 2024 has had " a powerful enabling influence , " said @entity108 , @entity1 's chief scientist for the iss. the decision adds four years to the station 's planned lifetime -- an important step when it can take up to three years to develop a new instrument , she said			1
unlike other @entity5 - science satellites , the station passes over different points on @entity5 at different times with each orbit			1
but while it lacks that consistency , it 's also up to 400 km ( 250 miles ) closer to the planet , @entity120 said			0
" when you 're a little closer , you can see things in more detail , " she said			0
@entity8 backs space station through 2024			1

@entity1 hopes to put five new instruments in orbit in 2014
the launches include three satellites and two devices mounted on the space station
@entity1 says the missions will " truly reinvigorate " its @entity5 observation network
