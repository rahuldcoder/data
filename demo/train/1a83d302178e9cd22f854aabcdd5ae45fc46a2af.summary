@entity0 , @entity1 -- troubled relations between @entity4 suffered a fresh blow friday after @entity0 decided to withdraw all its remaining citizens from the manufacturing zone jointly operated by the two			1
the televised announcement by @entity1 unification minister @entity9 followed @entity11 's dismissal of a request for talks about the deteriorating situation at @entity15			1
@entity16 halted activity at the complex this month amid heightened tensions in the region			2
the @entity1 ' imminent departure bodes ill for the future of the zone , the last major symbol of cooperation between the two countries			1
it had continued to operate throughout previous @entity29 tensions during the past eight years			0
in the past two months , tensions on the @entity31 has been rich in saber - rattling and short on concrete actions			0
but the @entity15 complex , which is on the @entity4 's side of the border and houses the operations of more than 120 @entity1 companies , appears to have become a significant victim			1
growing suffering @entity9 said the decision to withdraw the roughly 175 @entity1 was a result of their " growing suffering caused by the unjust actions of the @entity4 , " which has been preventing workers , as well as food and medical supplies , from crossing the border into the zone for the past several weeks			2
in an apparent last ditch attempt to resolve the crisis thursday , @entity1 proposed formal talks with the @entity4 , warning of serious consequences if the offer was rejected			1
' @entity56 ' offer rejected but the @entity4 spurned the proposal			0
in a statement on state media friday , a spokesman for the @entity59 described @entity0 's offer of talks about the complex as " deceptive			1
" it said that if @entity0 " keeps aggravating the situation , " it would " be forced to take the final decisive and crucial measure first			0
" the @entity1 who remain in the complex are believed to have been looking after the idle factories there			0
@entity9 said friday that the @entity1 government would support the companies invested in the complex so they can continue with their business activities			1
suspending activity earlier this month , during a frenzy of fiery rhetoric directed at @entity1 and the @entity76 , the @entity4 began blocking @entity1 from entering the complex across the heavily fortified border			1
it then pulled out the more than 50,000 @entity11 who work in the zone 's factories , saying it was temporarily suspending activity there			1
the move surprised some observers since @entity15 was considered to be a key source of hard currency for the regime of @entity87			0
the situation on the @entity31 deteriorated after the @entity4 carried out its latest underground nuclear test in february , prompting the @entity90 to tighten sanctions on the regime in @entity16			0
the tougher sanctions , together with joint @entity76 - @entity1 military training exercises in @entity1 , intensified @entity11 's threats against @entity96 and @entity0			1
the @entity98 's ominous language , which unnerved the @entity76 enough for it to move missile - defense systems into the region , had appeared to calm somewhat recently			2
and the @entity76 - @entity1 military exercises are due to end in the coming days			0
remarks against ' @entity76 imperialists ' but at an event to celebrate the anniversary of the creation of the @entity11 military on thursday , senior officials made remarks that revived the theme of nuclear attack against " @entity76 imperialists , " something the @entity4 repeatedly used in its rhetoric over the past two months			0
' one click away ' @entity11 pilots " once given a sortie order , will load nuclear bombs , instead of fuel for return , and storm enemy strongholds to blow them up , " the state - run news agency cited one commander , @entity116 , as saying at the event in @entity16 on thursday			0
@entity126 was reported as saying that @entity11 's " inter-continental ballistic missiles have set the dens of the brigandish @entity76 imperialists as their first target and officers and men of the @entity125 are one click away from pushing the launch button			2
" earlier this month , a @entity76 congressman disclosed a @entity136 assessment that judged with " moderate confidence " that the @entity98 can deliver a nuclear device with a missile , though with " low " reliability			2
but @entity141 , the director of national intelligence , later told the @entity142 that other @entity76 intelligence agencies do n't share the @entity136 's conclusion			0
