ambulances filled with @entity16 patients , some that have traveled seven hours to get there , are not unloaded			1
without help to get them inside , the patients fall in the dirt , mere feet away from treatment			2
without help , family members must care for these @entity16 patients			1

" ebola outbreak : how to help at his church , he 's called off the part of the service where congregation members shake hands			0
he tells them not to hug when they see each other , and no one takes communion wine from the same chalice any more			0
