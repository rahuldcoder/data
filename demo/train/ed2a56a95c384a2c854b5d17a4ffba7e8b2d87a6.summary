@entity0 -- colleagues of sen. @entity3 of @entity4 mourned his death as family and friends planned his funeral			1
@entity3 , the longest - serving member of the @entity9 , died monday at the age of 92			2
under @entity4 law , the state 's popular two - term @entity12 governor , @entity11 , has the power to appoint @entity3 's successor			1
@entity11 is expected to name a fellow member of his party to succeed @entity3 , who was also a @entity19 , thereby keeping a total of 59 @entity12 in the @entity21			1
there are questions , however , regarding exactly how long @entity3 's appointed successor can serve before another election is held			1
@entity4 law says that if a @entity21 vacancy is created within two and a half years of the end of a term , the appointed successor will automatically serve out the remainder of the term			1
if not , a special election is required			1
@entity3 's current term is scheduled to end on january 3 , 2013			0
the two and a half year mark will be reached on saturday , july 3			0
@entity4 law fails , however , to state exactly when a vacancy occurs			1
whether the vacancy is considered to have been created at the moment of @entity3 's death , or when the @entity21 informs state officials of the vacancy , or when @entity11 declares the seat vacant will be crucial			1
@entity4 -- a traditional @entity12 stronghold -- has been increasingly competitive for the @entity40			2
@entity41 easily defeated @entity42 in @entity4 in the 2008 presidential election			1
neither @entity11 nor the @entity12 - led @entity21 have made any official declarations yet			1
as question swirl around the timing of the next election for @entity3 's seat , numerous political leaders have been issuing statements in remembrance of the nine - term senator : -- president @entity42 " the people of @entity4 have lost a true champion , the @entity21 has lost a venerable institution , and @entity56 has lost a voice of principle and reason with the passing of @entity3			1

he was born into wrenching poverty , but educated himself to become an authoritative scholar , respected leader , and unparalleled champion of our @entity66			0
he scaled the summit of power , but his mind never strayed from the people of his beloved @entity4			2
he had the courage to stand firm in his principles , but also the courage to change over time			0

" -- sen. @entity89 , @entity74 - @entity4 " it has been my greatest privilege to serve with @entity3 in the @entity21			1
i looked up to him , i fought next to him , and i am deeply saddened that he is gone			0
he leaves a void that simply can never be filled			2
but i am lifted by the knowledge of his deep and abiding faith in @entity99 , i have joy in the thought of him reunited with his dear ( late wife ) @entity103 , and i am proud knowing that his moving life story and legacy of service and love for @entity4 will live on			2
senator @entity3 came from humble beginnings in the southern coalfields , was raised by hard - working @entity111 , and triumphantly rose to the heights of power in @entity56			2
but he never forgot where he came from nor who he represented , and he never abused that power for his own gain			0
" -- senate majority leader @entity118 , @entity119 " by virtue of his endurance , @entity3 knew and worked with many of the greats of the @entity21			1
because of his enduring virtue , he will be remembered as one of them			0

there will never be another like him			0
" -- senate minority leader @entity132 , @entity133 " sen. @entity3 combined a devotion to the @entity66 with a deep learning of history to defend the interests of his state and the traditions of the @entity21			1
we will remember him for his fighter 's spirit , his abiding faith , and for the many times he recalled the @entity21 to its purposes			2
... we are glad to know that senator @entity3 and his beloved @entity103 are reunited			0
we extend our deepest sympathies to the entire @entity3 family			0
" -- sen. @entity149 , @entity150 " no senator came to care more about the @entity66 or to be a more effective defender of our constitutional government than the senior senator from @entity4			1
he was a senator 's senator			0
... i know him as a mentor and a friend			0
i was honored to stand with him and fight against assaults on the @entity66 and against an unnecessary and costly war in @entity164			0
he was a self - educated man who learned much throughout his life and had much to teach us all			2
he was a symbol of @entity4 , he was an outstanding senator , and he was extraordinary @entity56			2
" -- sen. @entity169 , @entity170 " it is a sad day for all of us			0
there was no one who loved the institution of the @entity21 more , and no one who was a better student of it			1
