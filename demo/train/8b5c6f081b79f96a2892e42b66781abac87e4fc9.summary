@entity0 is both the first person diagnosed with @entity2 in the @entity3 and the first person to die of the virus here			1
why ? because , according to his nephew , staff at the @entity12 hospital where he was treated " did n't even give him a chance			1
" " nobody tried to help @entity16 , " @entity14 said friday night			0
" ... if they would have given him a chance , he would have fought his way through			0
" in an emotional interview with @entity1 's @entity22 , @entity14 alleged that @entity27 officials " said no to everything " relatives requested and " lied to us the whole time			2
" he also accused the hospital of giving @entity0 inferior treatment because he was poor , had no health insurance and was black			1
" had ( he ) been another color , he probably would be living today , he would have survived it , " he said			0
" and that 's what 's really hurting me the most : ... they treated him the way they did because of the color of ( his ) skin			0
" ... you stand a chance if you 're white , but not if you 're black			2
" this was n't the first time members of @entity0 's camp have made such claims			1
responding to these allegations , the hospital issued a statement thursday defending its handling of the 42 - year - old @entity54 national 's case			0
its involvement started september 25 , when @entity0 first came into its emergency room with a fever and was let go four hours later ; resumed september 28 , when an ambulance brought him back ; and ended with his death wednesday morning			1
during that first visit and again after his admission -- when more than 50 people cared for @entity0 in a 24 - bed intensive care unit set aside for his care -- the hospital said , " our care team provided mr. @entity0 with the same high level of attention and are that would be given any patient , regardless of nationality or ability to pay for care			1
" the hospital said : " we have a long history of treating a multicultural community in this area			0
" in its thursday statement , @entity27 addressed other criticisms as well			2
why was n't he immediately given an experimental drug ? because one was n't available , the hospital explained			2
why did n't he get a blood transfusion , like other @entity2 patients in the @entity3 ? because " his blood type was not compatible with the serum donors			1
" 7 ways @entity0 's @entity2 case differs from others in @entity3 as to @entity0 's condition the first time he went to @entity27 , the hospital said he had a " low grade fever and abdominal pain , " and was released with some antibiotics and a pain reliever			1
@entity14 claims that discharge papers show that @entity0 , in fact , had a 103 - degree fever when he left the hospital			1
dr. @entity100 , director of the @entity101 , told @entity1 on thursday -- as he and other officials have said previously -- that " clearly there was a misstep early on when he was n't diagnosed immediately " in that first @entity106 visit			0
there have been criticisms that hospital staff did n't process the fact @entity0 had come from @entity54 , where @entity2 has infected and killed thousands			1
but @entity100 said that blaming the hospital for @entity0 's death is " misplaced , " even if it is " understandable " for a mourning family			1
" i just ca n't believe that he was deliberately treated in a less well way than others , " said @entity100			0
it seems no explanation , no justification , will wipe away @entity121 ' grief for a man he called " my brother , my uncle , my best friend " as a " very good person ' who would help anyone regardless of their skin color , their health condition or anything else			0
wiping away tears , @entity14 said that , while he 's obviously upset at the @entity12 hospital , he would be fine if @entity0 could miraculously come back to life			2
" ( but ) he 's dead			0
there 's nothing you can do , " the nephew said			0
" you ca n't bring him back ... i ca n't have him ( back )			0
" complete coverage on @entity2			2
