-- over the past few weeks , about 18 palestinians and three @entity2 have been killed in the occupied @entity1 territories			1
although president @entity6 rightly condemned the tragic killing of three @entity2 teenagers , the majority of @entity1 victims have been largely reduced to faceless , nameless statistics who do not elicit comparable reaction			1
exceptions are the case of @entity14 , an @entity15 and that of his cousin 16 - year - old @entity16 , who was abducted by @entity2 and then burned to death			1
@entity18 was visiting his relatives in @entity20 and was captured on video being beaten unconscious by @entity2 police			2
but his beating might only have become public because he is an @entity24			0
while @entity18 was released from detention after three days under a growing media spotlight , hundreds of @entity1 who have been rounded up remain detained with uncertain futures			2
[ the @entity2 army said eight @entity1 killed this week in a military operation were " suspected militants , " but there is no way to be certain			1
the rest were unarmed civilians			0
] the inattention to other @entity1 deaths and suffering is the most recent reason i have a hard time reconciling the perspective of our politicians and media organizations with the experiences of my family , including the slaying of a young , promising son of my cousin @entity49 two months ago			1
my exposure to this conflict began when i was 11 , visiting @entity52 for only the second time			2
i was born and raised in the @entity55 area and my concerns at that point did not extend much beyond the success of my @entity60 baseball team			0
" when we get older we will be in prison			0
" i was surprised to hear this statement from my 11 - year - old cousin , @entity64 , referring to himself and his 13 - year - old brother , who nodded nonchalantly in agreement			0
i learned a lot from @entity49 and his brothers that summer			2
my cousins walked without fear , at least outwardly , past the armed @entity2 soldiers who were scattered across the streets of their hometown			1
these cousins were nothing like the kids i was growing up with			0
though they were my age , i marveled that they had the outlook and courage of men			0
why has the violence flared up again ? even then , i realized their environment forced them to skip much of their childhood			0
@entity49 was just 5 years old when , around the time an @entity2 military court sent one of his older brothers to prison , his grieving mother died of a heart attack			1
the fun of that summer ended when @entity49 's 17 - year - old brother was targeted in a raid by an undercover @entity2 military unit			1
we became consumed with trying to visit him in prison			0
i have never forgotten the sight of him			0
the young man i knew with the flowing hair was reduced to a captive with a shaved head in prison garb			0
@entity2 's military occupation continued to haunt the @entity64 family as it has so many @entity1			1
while some of the brothers left @entity52 to build lives elsewhere , most remained			2
in 1996 , my family recounts , @entity49 's recently married older brother @entity114 was killed by an @entity2 military helicopter gunship while photographing clashes in his neighborhood			1
[ a @entity120 report outlines the events , but does not mention the many victims by name			0
] the failure of the peace process and the failure of the international community to uphold @entity1 rights has meant real pain and suffering for my extended family , but our tragedy is not unique or even extraordinary			1
these stories are the stories of life for most palestinians caught up in @entity2 's long - running domination of us and our land			1
the last time i saw my cousin was during a visit to @entity52 in 2006			1
@entity49 was a proud father of beautiful children , running his own hair salon , named affectionately after his son @entity144 , and finding a way to persevere through tough times			1
his infectious smile had not changed			0
that is , until recently			0
nothing could prepare me for the images that came bursting through my social media feed			0
first , the images of a handsome boy , labeled " @entity156 " then the images of his father , @entity49			2
just as he had no choice but to be thrown into the role of grieving son as a child , and grieving brother as a young man , he was now cast in the role of grieving parent -- the worst role imaginable			0
in tv interviews , he somehow maintained his composure , drawing upon all that had made him strong during his life , but in photographs , the anguish in his eyes was searing			0
his childhood expectation of imprisonment foreshadowed something even worse			0
his 17 - year - old son @entity144 felt compelled to protest at the site of the dreaded @entity178 , accused by human rights groups of torture and abuses of @entity1 children			1
the protest was on may 15 , the day of @entity184 , which commemorates the 66 - year dispossession of the @entity1 people from our homes and lands			2
@entity144 went to protest in support of political prisoners on a hunger strike			2
imprisonment has featured prominently in the life of the @entity64 family and @entity1 as a whole			1
a stunning 800,000 @entity1 have been imprisoned since @entity2 's occupation of the @entity197 and @entity198 began in 1967 , according to the @entity199 of @entity200			1
the released video footage proves @entity144 posed no threat to any @entity2 soldier			1
the @entity2 military denied responsibility , saying it used only " non-violent means " to disperse the crowd			2
the @entity2 defense minister @entity208 claimed " it was a life - threatening situation , so the officers acted accordingly			1
" the video and other evidence , however , tell a different story			0
they indicate live ammunition was used unlawfully to kill @entity144 and 16 - year - old @entity216 , with execution - style accuracy			2
@entity218 has since called the killings an " apparent war crime			0
" following repeated attempts by @entity2 officials to obfuscate the truth , @entity49 made the agonizing decision to exhume his son 's body and have an autopsy performed in front of international forensic pathologists who unanimously confirmed it was the use of live ammunition that killed @entity144			1
evading accountability for killing @entity1 children has become common practice for the @entity2 military			1
in the past year alone , hidden beneath the headlines of a now - defunct peace process , more than 50 @entity1 have been quietly killed by the @entity2 military , including children , according to the @entity239			1
since the year 2000 , more than 1,500 children have been killed , another 6,000 injured and more than 10,000 arrested , according to the @entity241 and reported in @entity242			0
the time has come for the @entity24 and the international community to hold @entity2 responsible for its crimes and launch an independent investigation			0
not only must the soldier who pulled the trigger be brought to justice , but the chain of command and ruling government that bears responsibility for his actions must be held accountable			0
the jurisdiction of the @entity256 should be sought , and the @entity24 and @entity257 should institute travel restrictions on specific @entity2 commanders who have overseen criminal violence in @entity52			1
the likelihood of these constructive actions , however , seems remote			0
just last week , the @entity24 @entity263 voted to increase funding for @entity2 's military by $ 131 million beyond the $ 3.1 billion granted in the 2014 fiscal year			2
and upon discovery of the bodies of the three missing @entity2 teenagers in the @entity197 , president @entity6 spoke immediately and movingly about how as a father he could not imagine the " indescribable pain that the parents of these teenage boys are experiencing , " yet he never offered any such sympathy to @entity49 , his wife or any of the other @entity1 parents of murdered children			1
as a @entity24 citizen whose tax dollars contribute to our annual military aid package to @entity2 , i ca n't help but feel complicit			0
writing about this tragedy from the comfort of my suburban @entity24 home feels so trite , while my relatives , like so many in @entity52 , are left to grieve as the world averts its eyes			2
i want to share the name @entity292 , so we can never again say we did not know			0
only when we recognize that all victims , whether @entity1 or @entity2 , deserve to have their story told can we have hope that in life , @entity1 and @entity2 can be equals , too .			1

@entity300 's cousins in @entity52 were resigned to a tough life
@entity303 : @entity2 teen deaths a tragedy , but @entity1 deaths are just statistics
@entity303 *shocked* to see teen son of his cousin @entity49 had been shot and killed
he wants the tragic death of the son , @entity144 , and his *friend* to be remembered
