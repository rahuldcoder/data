as part of @entity11 ' recently concluded redistricting process , @entity21 will lose the heavily @entity25 blue - collar port city of @entity26 while gaining several smaller , more conservative towns to bring in more than 300,000 new constituents			2
" i decided many years ago i will not be here when i 'm 75 , " @entity1 said , saying that meant the 2012 election would have been his last			2
" everybody has a last term , and if you 're talking about people that you 've substantially represented , then that 's not an obstacle , " he said			0
" but then i would then be required to go to 325,000 people , some of whom i 've never represented , and areas i 've never been involved in , and say to them , look , here 's the deal -- why do n't you elect me and for the next two years i will be there to receive your problems and , by the way , by the end of 2014 , i 'm going to dump them			0

" republicans were already gearing up for a strong race and @entity1 's sudden retirement injects added optimism and excitement into the election			0
" @entity1 , first elected to the @entity20 @entity19 in 1980 , is the top @entity10 on the powerful @entity73			1
the controversial 2010 @entity75 measure , designed to rein in @entity77 excesses after the 2008 financial collapse , passed the @entity19 without any @entity55 support			0

@entity1 did , however , receive an unusually strong challenge from @entity55 @entity97 in 2010			0
