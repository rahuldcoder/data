-- his was a suicide with a macabre twist			0
in february , former @entity4 safety @entity3 shot himself in the chest , but not before leaving behind a note requesting his brain be studied for evidence of a disease striking football players			1
the plaintive note read , " please , see that my brain is given to the @entity14 's brain bank			1
" today , scientists announced that @entity3 's brain tissue showed " moderately advanced " evidence of chronic traumatic encephalopathy , a dementia - like brain disease afflicting athletes exposed to repeated brain trauma			1
" @entity3 had classic pathology of cte and no evidence of any other disease , " said dr. @entity22 , a neuropathologist with the @entity24 , and co-director of the @entity26 for the @entity27			1
" he had severe involvement of areas that control judgment , inhibition , impulse control , mood and memory			0
" @entity29 has been found in the brains of 14 of 15 former @entity14 players thus far studied at the center			1
their cases share a common thread -- repeated concussions , sub-concussive blows to the head , or both			0
the picture beginning to emerge from these cases is that trauma could be causing brain damage			0
a brain with @entity29 is riddled with dense clumps of a protein called tau			1
under a microscope , tau appears as brown tangles that look similar to dementia			0
except the cases of @entity29 have shown this progressive , dementia - like array in players well in advance of a typical dementia diagnosis , which typically occurs in the 70s or 80s			1
@entity65 , an offensive lineman with the @entity66 whose @entity29 was also diagnosed posthumously , was 50 when he died			2
@entity67 , a nine - year @entity14 veteran who played most of his career with the @entity69 , was 45 , and @entity3 was 50			1
scientists at @entity26 have found evidence of @entity29 in the brain of an athlete as young as 18			1
" to see the kind of changes we 're seeing in 45 - year - olds is basically unheard of , " said @entity22 in an earlier interview with @entity0			0
@entity3 suffered a minimum of 10 known concussions during the course of his career , some of them involving loss of consciousness , said dr. @entity87 , co-director of the @entity88			1
symptoms that nagged @entity3 after he retired from the @entity14 in 1993 were typical of cases such as @entity65 and @entity67 , including problems with impulse control , an increasingly short fuse and headaches			1
@entity3 's ex-wife said that while playing professionally , the head trauma he bore on the field would become plain after games ended			2
" sometimes he would come home with extreme headaches , " said @entity99 during an interview with @entity0 in february			0
" we would meet after the game and he would want me to drive because he felt dizziness or he just did n't feel stable			0
" @entity99 said that several years before he died , her husband had been extremely bright , articulate and gifted			0
but as time wore on , he began to lose those faculties			0
@entity3 began to have trouble forming coherent sentences and spelling			2
alongside cognitive and emotional problems , a business that he established after his @entity14 career was failing			1
the tragic culmination of his problems was his suicide february 17 of this year			0
" we do seem to be seeing an increased rate in athletes who have early and moderate stage @entity29 , " said @entity22 , adding the caveat that the @entity26 sample is autopsy - based and therefore inherently biased			2
@entity3 's death , and specifically the decision to shoot himself in the chest , apparently to avoid damaging his brain tissue , shocked members of his family and the football community			2
@entity3 's is the first case in the @entity29 narrative in which a player ostensibly took his own life to have his brain studied			1
" it 's important for people to understand that it does not help our research or our mission of the @entity88 to take their own lives because they fear they have this disease , " said @entity87			0
" the future will lead to successful treatment of this disease			0
" @entity3 's son @entity146 said the analysis of his father 's brain -- the answers to questions about his death -- has given the family a measure of closure			2
" it is my greatest hope that his death will not be in vain and that through this research his legacy will live on and others wo n't have to suffer in this manner , " said @entity156 .			0
