-- it may sound crazy			0
why would a high - ranking executive lie about his or her credentials , especially now , when all it takes is a quick phone call or internet search to verify information ? yet it happens more often than you might think			1
from a white lie about time spent as a customer service rep to a whopper about earning an @entity19 , résumé padding occurs regularly across industries , experts say			1
in a 2010 survey of 1,818 organizations , 69 % reported catching a job candidate lying on his or her résumé , according to employment screening service @entity27			1
the most common lie on a résumé has to do with education , said @entity32 , founder and director of @entity34 and @entity36 's résumé expert			1
the discovery that @entity39 ceo @entity38 does not have a bachelor 's degree in accounting and computer science ( he has a bachelor of science degree in business administration , with a major in accounting ) makes him the latest executive to be targeted for falsely claiming to have a degree			1
or , at least , a certain kind of degree			1
in the wake of the allegation , made by shareholder firm @entity53 , @entity39 removed all references to @entity38 's degree from his biography on its website and said the error " in no way alters that fact that mr. @entity38 is a highly qualified executive with a successful track record leading large consumer technology companies			1
" the company 's board said tuesday that it has hired an outside counsel to conduct a review of the false statement			0
the incident has raised debate over whether the gaffe counts as inconsequential " fudging " or " exaggeration " of his credentials or a lie that casts a shadow over his long career			1
readers weigh in on résumé padding many in the tech industry , including @entity53 , are demanding @entity38 's ouster			2
others have spoken out on his behalf , calling upon the " @entity86 bloggerati " to stop picking on @entity38			0
" @entity38 has a degree in accounting , not computer science , but frankly at this point in his career does it really matter what he studied as an undergraduate ? " @entity95 technology editor @entity94 " @entity94 asked in a @entity97 column			1
" ( @entity38 is ) 54 years old , has been ceo of @entity99 , and before that held high positions at @entity102 , a subsidiary of @entity103 , and @entity104			1
he 's qualified to run @entity39			1
" @entity105 : @entity39 may need to go back to the drawing board résumé " embellishments " among titans of industry have led to mixed results			1
former @entity113 ceo @entity112 resigned less than nine months after taking his post after the revelation that he did not have degrees in theology and psychology			2
on the other hand , @entity120 's @entity119 offered to resign when it was discovered that he had not earned his mba from @entity123 , as he 'd claimed			0
the board did not accept his resignation , but he was forced to give up his bonus that year			0
it 's not a phenomenon exclusive to @entity130 companies			2
former @entity132 football coach @entity131 resigned after five days on the job when it came to light that he did not have a master 's in education from @entity123 or play football at the @entity139			0
résumé padding has become a point of increasing concern for companies big and small , prompting them to step up screening methods and background checks for job applicants , according to @entity27 's @entity148			1
" screening continues to be a heavily adopted practice by employers in order to protect their business from unnecessary risks , maintain compliance and avoid poor quality hires , " the report said			2
" even where lies may not represent a huge loss to the employer , companies report that catching a candidate in an untruth undermines confidence and credibility			2
" the 2010 survey found that 94 % of respondents performed criminal checks , 70 % performed identity and previous employment verification , and about half verified education and references			2
@entity32 sees résumé padding with growing frequency in her role as a résumé adviser because of the fluctuating job market and high unemployment rates			1
people often omit months in the start and end dates of their last jobs to exaggerate periods of employment and minimize unemployment			2
they also exaggerate accomplishments , like raising sales from 15 % to 25 % , or take individual credit for a project that was accomplished through teamwork , she said			0
inflating titles from receptionist to administrative assistant , for example , also occurs frequently , she said			0
people see job postings for which they feel they have the right experience but not the requisite degree , prompting them to fabricate an extra line on their résumés , @entity32 said			2
" people feel inadequate and that they have to do whatever it takes to get their foot in the door			0
it 's a combination of wanting to get an edge and jobs being limited due to the economy , " she said			0
" people see others getting ahead and think , ' maybe it 's my résumé			0
' the temptation arises from a desire to stay competitive			1
" it comes at a high price , including eventually being found out or , for those with a guilty conscience , the constant fear of being found out , she said			0
it 's easy to disparage @entity38 , she said , but given the high incidence of résumé padding in general , people should use this opportunity to take a second look at their own résumés			1
" he got caught , so he 's the obvious target			0
but it 's quite likely that many of the people who will talk about him have a similar lie on their résumés , " she said			0
" sell your benefits , the ones that reflect ... why you 're perfect even though you do n't have the degree , " @entity32 suggested			0
" armed with an excellent résumé , you 'll get your foot in the door , and there 'll be something that comes along that 's perfect for you , and you can start a job on honest footing , and it 's just better for everybody			0
" do you think @entity38 deserves a pass or should he be reprimanded ? let us know in the comments or tweet your thoughts to @ @entity254 !			0
