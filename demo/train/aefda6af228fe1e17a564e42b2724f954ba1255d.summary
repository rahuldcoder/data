-- @entity1 has supported @entity2 for years and worn the iconic yellow bracelet in honor of his uncle , stepmother and friends who have lost loved ones to cancer			1
he also has volunteered for the cancer charity as a photographer at sporting events that raise money for @entity2 's programs			2
the 49 - year - old @entity16 resident says he 'll continue to wear the bracelet despite news that embattled cyclist @entity19 is stepping down as chairman of the charity he founded 15 years ago			1
but the poster of @entity19 leading his @entity24 teammates in the team time trial at the @entity26 is coming down from his office wall amid news that the @entity30 found " overwhelming " evidence of @entity19 's involvement in doping as a professional cycler			2
" as a human being who has watched too many people suffer the loss of a loved one -- especially children -- i love what @entity19 created in @entity2 , " @entity1 said			1
" as a cyclist , i love what @entity19 accomplished , though like so many others i always suspected that he was guilty of doping			2
" like many who admired the accomplished cyclist and cancer research advocate , @entity1 is attempting to reconcile images of @entity19 as a fallen hero and a cancer survivor who used his stardom to dramatically change the stigma attached to the disease			2
" what @entity19 initiated through the formation of a foundation in his name and efforts through @entity2 far exceed this formal and seemingly final recognition of @entity19 's fallibility , " @entity1 said in a @entity55			1
" @entity63 sucks and it is much bigger than @entity19			2
" in the wake of news that the allegations cost @entity19 a major endorsement deal and chairmanship of @entity2 , @entity55 solicited views on @entity71 on @entity19 's conflicting legacy using the hashtag # livestrongthoughts			1
also , the @entity74 announced monday that @entity19 is being stripped of his @entity76 titles			2
" casting the doping allegations aside , @entity19 did more good than bad , he changed a generation 's view on cancer , " tweeted @entity77 , echoing a common sentiment			1
" my # livestrongthoughts are it 's not about @entity19 but about helping cancer patients			2
doper or not , cancer patients rely on # livestrong , " user @entity86 said			0
others , however , who saw @entity19 as a symbol of hope and solidarity were completely devastated by his fall , with some cynically wondering if @entity2 was a front to deflect attention from doping allegations			1
" it seemed that only a few years after his early comeback , he reverted into the same crass and cocky fella he was known to be pre-cancer			0
he lost any humility and never seemed contrite or thankful to be alive anymore , " ireporter @entity100 said			0
' it appeared he started using @entity2 as a brand to elevate himself and as a shield to cover or dodge criticism of his unsportsmanlike behavior			0
" @entity108 of @entity109 , @entity110 , and her sisters have been wearing their yellow bracelets since their father was diagnosed with end stage prostate cancer in 2004			2
" we bought bracelets for more strength , for unity , and suddenly @entity19 was n't just an athlete any longer , he was hope , " @entity115 , 51 , said in a @entity55			1
" we were connected to others who were proudly wearing the same [ bracelet ] yet living this horror of cancer , all of us , together with @entity19 , a man who went through it , and came out stronger and better			1
" when her father died in 2005 , the family respected his wish to be cremated wearing the bracelet and spent $ 200 dollars on the bracelets for family and friends to hand out			1
now , she says she ca n't wear the bracelet with pride anymore because of its connection to @entity19 and the organization			1
she has taken it off and vows to never again wear it			0
" my heart is broken by this news			0
i never thought @entity19 was involved in doping , i thought he was above it , an honest man with integrity and honor , " she said			2
" @entity19 is @entity2 , he is the face of hope			1
and when that face is that of a liar , a manipulator , for me ? i ca n't wear it with pride anymore			1
" still many see the charity as something bigger than @entity19 and plan to continue supporting the charity and wearing the bracelet			1
less certain is whether @entity19 will retain his hero status			0
@entity160 , a 29 - year - old breast cancer survivor , said she 'll continue to wear the bracelet because of what it means for those who have been touched by the disease			1
" to me , the organization has become more than @entity19			0
it has established itself as a valuable resource for cancer survivors and families and that is more important than these allegations , " @entity160 said in an @entity55			1
" the yellow wrist band that i wear each day reminds me of all that i have been through , the people i have known and lost along the way , and that we have a long way to go in our collective fight against cancer , " she said			0
" it represents my friend @entity182 's struggle and shows cancer survivors that others are thinking about cancer			1
" @entity187 cyclist @entity186 lost his father to bladder cancer in 2001 , two painful months after his diagnosis			0
" my father 's death afforded me the opportunity to look at life in a very different way			0
that day that i saw him close his eyes for the last time , i knew that i did n't want anyone else to have to go through the same experience that he did			0
" he purchased a @entity2 bracelet as a sign of hope , strength and perseverance against the disease , he said			1
" i also use it as a reminder , when i 'm climbing those long lonely steep canyons on the bike , that the pain and suffering that i 'm enduring is pittance and short - lived compared to what others are experiencing in their battle against cancer , " @entity186 , 42 , said in an @entity55			0
when a friend recently asked if he still wears the bracelet , @entity186 told him , " it 'll come off when there 's a cure for cancer			0
" " i still wear the bracelet and always will until this thing is cured			0
it helps me to maintain focus on what is important			0
" @entity227 , and @entity228 , believes that @entity19 's controversy has tainted @entity2 's legacy			1
@entity227 has supported the charity since its inception , but he would like to see its name changed in order to continue his support			0
he also says that @entity19 should no longer be the face of the charity			2
" @entity239 wins is a long time to keep up a lie			0
he was worshipped and adored by many people , " said @entity227 , 42			0
" if you ca n't accomplish the feat without cheating then it is not a feat , " he said			1
" it is a lie , and lots of people were looking up to those lies			0
" " like " @entity250 on @entity251 @entity252 contributed to this report .			0
