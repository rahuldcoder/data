-- in some post-election hardball between the @entity4 administration and newly - elected @entity5 , transportation secretary @entity1 is threatening to take back stimulus funds from states if they do not follow through on proposed rail projects			1
@entity0 obtained copies of letters @entity1 sent to incoming @entity5 governors in @entity12 and @entity13 who have stated their opposition to rail projects already underway in their states			1
in the letters , @entity1 said a rail link between @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 in @entity12 , and a high - speed rail connection between @entity24 , @entity25 , and @entity26 , @entity13 , are vital to economic growth in both regions			1
@entity1 wrote that he respects the power of governors to make decisions for their states , but , " there seems to be some confusion about how these high - speed rail dollars can be spent			1
" to @entity13 's gov. - elect @entity34 , @entity1 said that none of the funds can be used for roads or any other projects			1
he went on to say , " consequently , unless you change your position , we plan to engage in an orderly transition to wind down @entity13 's project so that we do not waste taxpayer 's money			2
" that letter was delivered on monday			0
a similar letter was sent to gov. - elect @entity48 in @entity12 on tuesday			1
in that letter , @entity1 mentions the thousands of jobs that would be created with the construction of a rail link between the state 's largest cities			2
@entity1 said he was aware that @entity48 had asked president @entity4 if $ 400 million dollars from the federal government intended to fund the passenger rail project could instead be used for road construction and freight lines			2
@entity1 wrote , " i wanted to let you know that none of those funds can be used for anything other than our @entity66 , " and he signaled his intention to take the money back if the project does n't move forward			0
the @entity68 has committed a total of $ 823 million to a 441 - mile - long high - speed rail connection from @entity24 to @entity71			1
but if @entity13 balks on the section that would run between @entity26 and @entity73 , the project can not be completed			0
similarly , the @entity68 committed $ 400 million to a 250 - mile - long intercity passenger rail line that would run from @entity22 , through @entity21 and @entity20 , and on to @entity19			0
the transportation secretary is in a fight to keep several proposed high - speed rail projects alive after @entity79 's @entity78 gov. @entity78 abruptly killed the nation 's largest infrastructure project last month			1
the @entity82 would have involved the construction of a second rail tunnel between @entity79 and @entity85 and an expansion of @entity87 in @entity85			0
it was expected to double commuter rail capacity on the @entity90 , the nation 's busiest rail line , and ease congestion on @entity79 's highways			0
now the feds want their money back from @entity79			0
on monday , a letter was sent from the @entity98 to @entity99 , the state 's public transportation authority , requesting an immediate repayment of $ 271 million in federal funds already spent on the project			1
the letter stated the funds were obligated for the @entity82 tunnel and because the project was terminated , the money most be returned			2
@entity99 officials responded by saying they are reviewing the request and they do not agree that the issue is as clear - cut as portrayed in the @entity98 letter			0
@entity78 put an end to the tunnel , claiming that potential cost overruns could range from $ 2 billion to $ 5 billion , something the cash - strapped state can not afford			0
but @entity68 officials believe any cost overruns on @entity82 would n't have exceeded $ 800 million .			0
