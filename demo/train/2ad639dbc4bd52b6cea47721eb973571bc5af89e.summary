every day , 22 veterans take their own lives			0
that 's a suicide every 65 minutes			1
as shocking as the number is , it may actually be higher			0
the figure , released by the @entity6 in february , is based on the agency 's own data and numbers reported by 21 states from 1999 through 2011			1
those states represent about 40 % of the @entity13 population			0
the other states , including the two largest ( @entity15 and @entity16 ) and the fifth - largest ( @entity17 ) , did not make data available			1
who was n't counted ? people like @entity21 , who hanged himself in his grandfather 's garage in @entity17 on april 5 , 2007			1
he was haunted , says his mother , @entity24 , by an @entity27 child 's death			1
he had handed the girl a bottle of water , and when she came forward to take it , she stepped on a land mine			0
when @entity33 returned home , he locked himself in a motel room for days			0
@entity36 saw a vacant stare in her son 's eyes			1
a while later , @entity33 was called up for a tour of @entity42			0
he did n't want to kill again			0
he went awol and finally agreed to an " other than honorable " discharge			0
@entity33 was not in the @entity6 system , and @entity17 did not send in data on veteran suicides to the @entity6			1
experts have no doubt that people are being missed in the national counting of veteran suicides			1
@entity52 , the veterans and military families coordinator in @entity55 , helped publish an extensive report on that state 's veteran suicides			1
veteran confronts rape and suicide part of the problem , she says , is that there is no uniform reporting system for deaths in @entity13			1
it 's usually up to a funeral director or a coroner to enter veteran status and suicide on a death certificate			1
veteran status is a single question on the death report , and there is no verification of it from the @entity79 or the @entity6			1
" birth and death certificates are only as good as the information that is entered , " @entity80 says			0
how much , i do n't know			0
" who else might not be counted ? a homeless person who has no one who can vouch that he or she is a veteran , or others whose families do n't want to divulge a suicide because of the stigma associated with mental illness ; they may pressure a state coroner to not list the death as suicide if a veteran intentionally crashes a car or dies of a drug overdose and leaves no note , that death may not be counted as suicide			1
an investigation by the @entity106 newspaper last year revealed an alarmingly high percentage of veterans who died in this manner in @entity16 , a state that did not send in data for the @entity6 report			1
" it 's very hard to capture that information , " says @entity114 , a psychologist who founded give an hour , a nonprofit group that pairs volunteer mental - health professionals with combat veterans			2
@entity121 had been home about four months from @entity42 when he was shot to death by police in @entity125 , @entity126 , in september 2010			0
the prosecutor 's office said @entity121 told officers " he wanted them to shoot him			2
" the case is one of many considered " suicide by cop " and not counted in suicide data			1
@entity137 enlisted in the @entity138 in 2007			0
she said she was raped by a fellow @entity138 at @entity139 and eventually was forced out of the corps with a personality disorder diagnosis			0
she did not tell her family that she was raped or that she had thought about suicide			2
she also did not tell them she was taking @entity145 , a drug prescribed for anxiety			0
her father , @entity148 , noticed that @entity149 was drinking heavily when she returned home			0
five days later , she went drinking with her sister , who left her intoxicated in a parked car			0
the @entity145 interacted with the alcohol , and she died in the back seat of the car			0
her blood alcohol content was six times the legal limit			0
police charged her sister and a friend in @entity149 's death for furnishing alcohol to an underaged woman : @entity149 was 20			2
@entity148 says his daughter intended to drink herself to death			0
later , @entity148 went through @entity149 's journals and learned about her rape and suicidal thoughts			2
a recent analysis by @entity169 , an investigative multimedia program for journalism students , found that the annual suicide rate among veterans is about 30 for every 100,000 of the population , compared with the civilian rate of 14 per 100,000			1
the analysis of records from 48 states found that the suicide rate for veterans increased an average of 2.6 % a year from 2005 to 2011 -- more than double the rate of increase for civilian suicide			1
nearly one in five suicides nationally is a veteran , even though veterans make up about 10 % of the @entity13 population , the @entity169 analysis found			2
the authors of the @entity6 study , @entity192 and @entity193 , included many cautions about the interpretation of their data , though they stand by the reliability of their findings			1
@entity193 said there was a consistency in the samples that allowed them to comfortably project the national figure of 22			0
but more than 34,000 suicides from the 21 states that reported data to the @entity6 were discarded because the state death records failed to indicate whether the deceased was a veteran			1
that 's 23 % of the recorded suicides from those states			1
so the study looked at 77 % of the recorded suicides in 40 % of the @entity13 population			2
the @entity6 report itself acknowledged " significant limitations " of the available data and identified flaws in its report			1
" the ability of death certificates to fully capture female veterans was particularly low ; only 67 % of true female veterans were identified			0
younger or unmarried veterans and those with lower levels of education were also more likely to be missed on the death certificate			0
" " we think that all suicides are underreported			2
there is uncertainty in the check box , " says @entity231 , the state registrar in @entity232 , which has one of the best suicide data recording systems in the country			1
websites become tool for stopping suicide @entity6 secretary @entity242 requested collaboration from all 50 states to improve timeliness and accuracy of suicide reporting , key to improving suicide prevention			1
at the time the @entity6 released its last suicide report , at least 11 states had not made a decision on data collaboration			1
combat stress is just one reason why veterans attempt suicide			2
military sexual assaults are another			0
psychologist @entity258 says his research is finding that military victims of violent assault or rape are six times more likely to attempt suicide than military non-victims			2
more than 69 % of all veteran suicides were among those 50 and older			2
mental - health professionals said one reason could be that these men give up on life after their children are out of the house or a longtime marriage falls apart			0
they are also likely to be @entity276 veterans , who returned from war to a hostile public and an unresponsive @entity6			1
combat stress was chalked up to being crazy , and many @entity276 veterans lived with ghosts in their heads without seeking help			0
even though more older veterans are committing suicide , it 's difficult to predict what the toll of @entity13 's newest wars will be			1
a survey by the @entity290 showed that 30 % of service members have considered taking their own life , and 45 % said they know an @entity42 or @entity27 veteran who has attempted suicide			2
" there 's probably a tidal wave of suicides coming , " says @entity295 , an @entity42 war veteran who started @entity296 , a nonprofit group that works to raise awareness of suicide			1
between october 2006 and june 2013 , the @entity302 received more than 890,000 calls			0
that number does not include chats and texts			0
president @entity307 says there is a need to " end this epidemic of suicide among our veterans and troops			2
" in august 2012 , he signed an executive order calling for stronger suicide prevention efforts			2
a year later , he announced $ 107 million in new funding for better mental health treatment for veterans with post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury , signature injuries of the wars in @entity27 and @entity42 .			0

the data the suicide rate is based on are *incomplete*
examples of *uncounted* : " suicide by cop , " by overdoses and by *vehicle* crashes
" there 's probably a tidal wave of suicides coming "
@entity6 makes appeal for more uniform reporting of suicide data
