-- a worker operating a machine in a family workshop in @entity4 accidentally cut off his hand -- which doctors were able to save by grafting it onto his lower calf			1
the worker , @entity9 , said he was initially unsure if his right hand could be saved , but he thought it was worth a try			1
the hand went without a blood supply for many hours while @entity9 searched for a hospital that could perform such a surgery			1
@entity9 said that he went to local hospitals near the factory first , but he said they told him they " did not have the skills to help			2
" eventually he found a hospital about two hours away where doctors believed they could do it			1
@entity9 kept his hand in a plastic bag at first , then stored it in a cooler of ice			1
in total , it took about seven hours to get to a doctor who could help			1
the doctor , dr. @entity29 , is a specialist in difficult tissue and wound repair cases			0
before @entity9 went into the operation , @entity29 told him he was optimistic and predicted he would regain the use of his hand , according to @entity9			1
@entity29 decided the best way to save the hand was to attach it to @entity9 's calf where there was a good blood supply			1
the hand would need to stay there until @entity9 's arm could fully heal			2
@entity29 believes there have been about 20 such cases in all of @entity4 and all of them have been successful			1
there is no data , as only case studies have been performed			0
@entity29 said in a similar operation in 2004 , he grafted a hand onto a patient 's belly			2
that operation was a success			0
when @entity9 woke up from the operation he said he was surprised to find his hand on his calf			1
he says his first reaction at the time was to think it was " unbelievable " and " weird			0
" the hand itself felt warm , he said , but it was numb since no nerves were connected and only blood vessels were attached			1
his leg felt no different , he said , but was " heavier than usual			0
" after about a month his arm was better healed , and he had another surgery where his hand was reattached			2
@entity29 says this second stage of the operation is actually more challenging , but everything went smoothly			0
@entity9 has recovered without complications and has been discharged			0
he is currently resting at home			0
he said he can twist his wrist to a certain degree , but does n't have full movement with his fingers , at least not yet			0
doctors told him a full recovery for the nerves in his hand should take about six months			2
@entity9 said he is n't sure what his future may bring			0
today he is concentrating on recovering fully			0
the factory did pay for his operation , which cost about 300,000 @entity4 yuan , or about $ 49,400			1
most of all , @entity9 said , he is thankful to doctors for " living up to their promise " that they would be able to reattach his hand and make it functional again			2
