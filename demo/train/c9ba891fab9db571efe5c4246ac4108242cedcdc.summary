-- shortly after we filed our case challenging the @entity6 , my client @entity3 was asked what it felt like to be a plaintiff suing the federal government			1
@entity10 , who grew up in a middle - class household after the @entity12 , said it was one thing to be " out " as a lesbian but another thing entirely to be the " out lesbian who happens to be suing the @entity18			1
" one year ago on thursday , the @entity18 @entity19 decided @entity10 's case by issuing a landmark decision that gay people have have the same right to dignity and respect under the law that straight people do			1
the so - called @entity6 , also known as @entity6 , was passed in 1996 and defined marriage as a union exclusively between a man and a woman			1
as a result , otherwise valid marriages of same - sex couples were rendered null and void under federal law and gay married couples were denied the full range of federal benefits that straight married couples received			1
when we filed @entity10 's case in 2010 , only five states and @entity41 , permitted same - sex couples to marry			1
when the @entity19 's decision came down last year , 12 states and @entity41 did			1
today , 19 states and @entity41 -- representing almost 44 % of the @entity18 population -- do			2
if you had told me last june that the world would look the way it does today for gay people , i would have said you need to be more realistic			0
how did this happen ? first and foremost , from the very beginning , our strategy was , to borrow a phrase from @entity59 's first presidential campaign , " it 's all about @entity10 , stupid			1
" unlike many previous @entity63 civil rights cases , our case involved only one plaintiff			0
the trouble with cases involving multiple plaintiffs is that the plaintiffs ' stories often got lost in the shuffle			0
after all , it 's hard for a judge or jury to focus on several plaintiff couples at once			0
it is much easier to focus only on one			0
and unfortunately , when the plaintiffs ' stories get lost in the background , a gay civil rights case can sound more like a debate between @entity81 and @entity82 than a case about real people and their lives			0
our view was that the best way to defeat @entity6 was not to focus on lawyers or pundits , but instead to explain how @entity6 harmed two real people , @entity3 , and her late spouse , @entity3			1
so how did we do that ? we decided to tell the story of @entity10 and @entity97 's lives as the great love story that it was			2
our goal was n't to write a @entity102 romance			0
rather , what we hoped to do was to show that @entity10 and @entity97 , who spent 44 years together in sickness and health till death did them part , lived their lives with the same decency and dignity as anyone else			2
we demonstrated that @entity10 and @entity97 had what justice @entity114 called a " grand partnership , " surely the kind of marriage any one of us -- straight or gay -- would be lucky to have			2
and the $ 363,000 federal estate tax bill that @entity10 received upon @entity97 's death solely because of @entity6 did n't hurt either			1
if @entity10 had been married to a man -- if " @entity97 " had been " @entity124 " -- then her estate tax bill would have been zero			2
any @entity18 , gay or straight , @entity125 or @entity126 , can understand how unfair it is to have to pay a huge tax bill simply because you are gay			0
in our brief for the @entity19 , we made three points to illustrate why the @entity19 needed to be suspicious of @entity134 ' motivation for passing @entity6			1
first , @entity6 was enacted because of moral disapproval of gay people who at the time were largely feared and misunderstood ; second , @entity6 essentially wrote gay people out of much of federal law ; and third , by instructing the federal government to ignore the marriages of only gay people by denying them benefits , @entity6 upset the historic relationship between the federal government and the states			1
the federal government had always otherwise deferred to the states ' definitions of marriage			2
fortunately , these three themes are interwoven throughout the @entity19 's opinion			2
on the moral disapproval point , justice @entity152 explains that " interference with the equal dignity of same - sex marriages was more than an incidental effect of [ @entity6 ]			1
" as for @entity6 's scope , the @entity19 notes that " @entity6 writes inequality into the entire @entity18 code " and describes @entity6 as " touching many aspects of married and family life , from the mundane to the profound			1
" and on our third point , the @entity19 points out @entity6 's " unusual deviation " from the federal government 's practice of recognizing otherwise lawful marriages			1
as the court concludes , @entity6 was invalid because " no legitimate purpose overcomes the purpose and effect to disparage and to injure those whom the @entity177 , by its marriage laws , sought to protect in personhood and dignity			2
" in other words , " by treating [ gay people ] as living in marriages less respected than others , [ @entity6 ] is in violation of the @entity184			0
" the @entity19 uses the word " dignity " 10 times in its 26 - page opinion in @entity18 v @entity3			1
sometimes , it 's the simplest and most obvious things that say the most			0
@entity191 , the state of being worthy of honor or respect , is exactly what the @entity3 case was all about			1
now that the @entity19 has recognized that gay people and their relationships are equally worthy of respect under the @entity200 , the legal equivalent of the @entity201 in the struggle for gay rights has been won			0
and you do n't have to take my word for it			0
twenty - five decisions throughout the country in states as far apart in geography and culture as @entity213 and @entity214 , @entity215 and @entity216 , @entity217 and @entity218 , have relied on @entity3 to extend rights to gay people			1
as of today , there 's not a single case that has gone the other way			0
it seems as though nearly every week , another court in another state expands the rights of gay people using the logic and language of the @entity3 decision			0
although i have the greatest regard for the superhuman bravery and brilliance of the playwright and activist @entity233 , i have to respectfully disagree with his recent statement that " considering how many of us there are ... we have achieved very little			0
" the truth is that no other minority group in @entity18 history has seen more progress toward equality more rapidly than gay people have			0
i completely agree with @entity126 sen. @entity245 when he recently conceded that " anybody who does not believe that gay marriage is going to be the law of the land ... is n't living in the real world			0
" but why is this so ? what has changed ? the answer is n't complicated			0
it 's because of the incredible courage of people such as @entity233 and @entity3 who came " out " and told the rest of the world " i 'm here and i 'm gay " that full equality for gay people under the law is about to become a reality .			2

a year ago thursday , a @entity19 ruling dismantled @entity6
@entity267 argued the case for @entity3 on *behalf* of same - sex marriage
@entity267 *reminded* herself " it 's all about @entity10 , stupid , " and @entity10 's 44 - year relationship
@entity267 's amazed at how many states have used @entity3 case to pass same - sex marriage
