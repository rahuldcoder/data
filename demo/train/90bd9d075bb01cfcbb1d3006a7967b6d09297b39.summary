editor 's note : the staff at @entity3 has recently been intrigued by the journalism of @entity5 , an independent media company and web site based in @entity7 , @entity8			2
@entity9 is the broadband television network of vice			1
the reports , which are produced solely by vice , reflect a transparent approach to journalism , where viewers are taken along on every step of the reporting process			0
we believe this unique reporting approach is worthy of sharing with our @entity3 readers			2
@entity7 , @entity8 ( @entity9 ) -- in this installment of the vice guide to @entity22 , @entity9 co-founder @entity19 travels to @entity23 to meet the pioneers of one of the most peculiar experimental film movements in history : @entity28			1
the genre marries @entity31 avant - garde agitprop filmmaking ( black and white , silent , odd angles , extreme closeups , rapid fire editing of good soviets at work ) with something called " @entity39 - realism , " a movement spearheaded by filmmaker @entity41 and consisting of very weird gay male zombie flicks that feature fat bald men having sex and eating each other 's brains			1
it was meant to be a comment on the impending fall of the @entity31 system and the decadence of the apparatchiks in charge			2
it grew to become much more			0
while @entity23 is known for its experimental works of the 1920s -- auteurs like @entity59 and @entity60 spring to mind -- this freedom of expression ended when @entity64 took power			1
for 60 years , @entity23 film was dominated by the drab , state - approved imagery of socialist realism			1
this genre was defined by stark scenes of the proletariat soldiering and toiling diligently over the land			0
making movies outside this milieu meant that the film - lovers , artists , actors and rock musicians who collaborated to create it were risking life and limb at the hands of the @entity84			0
but when the @entity31 collapsed , the threat of its primary intelligence agency diminished and @entity23 filmmakers began to unleash six decades of pent - up creative energy			1
the films that emerged were an insane mish - mash of booze , violence , surrealism and insanity			0
watch the rest of @entity97 at @entity9 for this episode , @entity19 journeys to @entity101 and @entity102 to meet several of the surviving founders of @entity28 and @entity39 - realism , many of whom are today extremely successful commercial producers and directors			2
in fact , a few of them now run some of the country 's key networks and continue to make films			0
@entity19 manages to uncover this fascinating underground art community and finds that to this day the @entity28 movement thrives			0
the devoted still have weekly parallel screenings and events , and even put out a monthly film publication			0
still , as he immerses himself in this unique film tradition , it becomes clear that , given @entity23 's present volatility , it may not exist much longer .			1

@entity9 journalist meets pioneers of " most peculiar " experimental film movement
genre born of freedom that came with collapse of @entity31
