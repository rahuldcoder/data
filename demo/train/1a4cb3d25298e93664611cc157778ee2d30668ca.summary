@entity0 -- in the 23 years since he tried to break up a robbery in central @entity0 , @entity2 has n't spent a day without severe pain			1
the fight left @entity6 with multiple fractures , including a broken back and two shattered ankles			0
he had a head injury so severe , doctors put him in a coma and kept him there for a month to control the swelling in his brain			2
" i spent nine months in hospital and then 12 months in a rehabilitation center , where i was basically rebuilt , " @entity2 says			1
" but nothing was done to treat my pain			2
" his regular doctor , a general practitioner with @entity22 's @entity21 , offered little for the pain despite his complaints			1
at the time , patients in @entity22 's government - run system such as @entity6 were n't able to switch to another doctor			1
unlike patients now , he was stuck			0
then @entity2 moved a few miles away -- as it turned out , far enough for him to be assigned to a different doctor			1
during their first meeting , @entity2 ' new physician asked if he had been to a pain clinic for treatment			1
" i said ' what 's that ? ' " @entity2 recalls			1
" when he explained to me what it was , and said he was going to send me in to it , i discovered that it was in the very hospital where i had been treated			0
i had no idea it even existed			0
" @entity6 ' experience highlights a reluctance of many @entity22 doctors to treat pain aggressively , including a reluctance to prescribe painkillers , especially opiates -- the rampant use of which in the @entity55 is widely described as an epidemic			1
prescription drug deaths : two stories overdoses from prescription painkillers , usually involving alcohol , recently overtook car crashes as the no. 1 cause of accidental death in the @entity55			1
despite making up less than 5 % of the world 's population , @entity55 patients consume about 80 % of all prescription pain medication			1
that 's enough each year to give every man , woman and child a dose every four hours for three weeks straight			2
it 's true that wealthier countries tend to use more pharmaceuticals overall			2
despite a similar standard of living , on a per - person basis , patients in the @entity22 receive less than half the pain medication as their @entity55 counterparts , according to the @entity81 to @entity82 , a @entity22 academic research group that studies issues related to medicine and drugs			1
and while the approach may anger patients like @entity6 , @entity22 physicians say it 's helped their country avoid the wave of misuse and overdoses that plagues the @entity55			1
the @entity21 runs roughly 300 pain clinics , and official guidelines from the @entity95 , a group of professionals , state , " in most situations , for most patients and most pains , opioids should not be considered as first - choice treatment			2
" other treatments , including physiotherapy , acupuncture and massage are widely used			0
while @entity55 doctors are also supposed to consider alternatives to medication , many are swayed by insistent patients , says dr. @entity112 , who runs the long - term pain clinic at @entity0 's @entity114 that he founded in 1997			1
by contrast , @entity112 says , " the physician ( in the @entity22 ) has a salary ... that takes away certain influences that the patient may have on the physician 's thinking			1
i do n't necessarily have to be liked by my patients			2
" @entity112 says the decision on whether to prescribe an opioid is complex , and only made after at least one long interview with the patient			2
" i tell ( patients ) , ' you must please stick to the dose i prescribed for you and you must not escalate it without medical permission			0
you must keep the medication locked up and safe			0
you must please not lose your prescriptions , because i 'm not going to replace them , ' " @entity112 says			0
" you begin to see we 're almost building up a contract between physician and patient			0
" but the process takes time			0
patients need to be referred to pain clinics by their primary doctor			2
on average , it takes 18 weeks for a patient to be referred to @entity112 's clinic , although he says in extreme cases he can sometimes find time to see a patient as soon as the next day			2
according to @entity6 , many patients do n't even know that they can ask for a referral			2
" there is a general lack of awareness of what there is out there to help ( people ) with their chronic pain			2
people do n't know the right questions to ask			2
" after finally getting his pain under control , in part with the use of painkillers , @entity2 founded the advocacy group action on pain to try and help other patients			1
" what we tend to find is a lot of frustration , " he says			0
some people say their doctors think they 're faking simply to receive powerful drugs			1
" there 's the fear that if ( people ) go public with a criticism , ( the doctors ) will give you a tough time , " @entity2 says			1
@entity186 : let 's end the prescription drug death epidemic just as powerful opioids are tightly restricted in the @entity22 , so are painkillers to which most @entity55 do n't give a second thought			1
while you can walk into virtually any @entity55 drugstore and pick up a bottle of ibuprofen or acetaminophen with 400 or 500 tablets , the largest size on @entity22 shelves contains just 16 pills			1
if you consult a pharmacist and he or she approves , you can purchase 32 pills			0
" we have to protect the patient , " says @entity205 , a pharmacist at @entity206 in @entity0 , who notes that even a moderate overdose of @entity208 can cause liver damage and even death			0
shown a typical 400 - count bottle of acetaminophen from a @entity55 drugstore , @entity205 shook his head with dismay			1
" i 'm astonished , " he says			0
" that 's a bottle of death			0
" while that may sound alarmist , 12 million @entity55 in 2010 reported using opioid painkillers they might not need , or using them without a prescription			1
for all that , the stark differences between the two countries may be starting to blur			0
in some areas of the @entity55 , doctors are shifting to a stricter approach			1
last month , @entity230 announced that patients at public hospitals would no longer be able to receive more than a three - day supply of medicines such as @entity235 and @entity236			0
lost or stolen prescriptions will not be refilled			0
another example is @entity239 , where an educational course for anyone who prescribes opioids is required by law , and a so - called " pain contract " to accompany any prescription			0
meanwhile , the number of painkillers prescribed in the @entity22 is on the rise			1
one factor may be recent changes to the @entity21 allowing people more flexibility in choosing a doctor			0
@entity2 still walks with two crutches			1
like the weather , his pain is always there , even as it changes from day to day			0
" it 's a constant nagging pain and then it alternates up to a really sharp , needly pain , a stabbing pain , " the 63 - year - old says			2
on good days , he can stand to be philosophical			0
" i 'm in pain every day			0
it 's just a part of life			0
" @entity1 's @entity264 contributed to this report .			0

@entity22 's @entity2 dealt with pain for years and did n't know options were available
@entity22 doctors are reluctant to prescribe painkillers , especially opiates
even drugs sold over the counter are restricted in pharmacies there
but the differences between the @entity55 and @entity22 may be blurring
