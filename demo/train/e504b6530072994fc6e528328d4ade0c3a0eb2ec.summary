@entity0 , @entity1 -- the old @entity5 paint and body shop was vacant -- 24,000 square feet of metal and concrete surrounded by a sea of asphalt			1
but when some members of @entity12 saw it , they saw a home			1
since it was founded in 2003 , the conservative @entity16 congregation had bounced from location to location outside @entity19 -- a @entity20 , a windowless space in a school , any place they could rent or borrow as they grew			1
" sometimes , from week to week , we did n't know exactly where we were going to be , " said @entity25 , president of the congregation and a member since its early years			2
" all the while ... we probably walked every piece of available property and real estate in @entity0 , trying to find something , anything , that would look like it			2
" in 2010 , the congregation purchased the former auto shop , seeing the promise of their own synagogue in its bare white walls			1
" that was the first leap of imagination someone had to make , and it 's a big leap , " said architect @entity41 , whose firm , @entity42 , worked on the synagogue			1
in architecture , it 's called adaptive reuse -- remaking old buildings for new purposes			1
@entity41 and his partner , @entity52 , are n't @entity16 , and they had never before worked on a religious structure			0
but the @entity56 faculty members had transformed several old buildings and an " uncanny " number of automotive spaces : a carriage house - turned - art gallery , a renovated a truck depot that became the @entity63 and their own office , which is housed within a former @entity19 auto parts shop			1
there was nothing sacred about the auto shop , a spare structure built in the 1990s			1
but it was available , affordable and allowed the congregation to remain central to its members , all while healing a patch of earth that had been left neglected			0
" or @entity76 , " members point out , means " new light " in @entity78			0
" there was not an ounce of excess to it , " @entity41 said of the old building			1
" even with this harsh industrial site , the idea was to impart their principles and values onto the site			0
" the congregation wanted its home to work for 362 days of the year , with a large sanctuary , social hall and classrooms for its 400 member families			0
they could always find a larger venue for the @entity98 , when more people attend services			0
they planned on an energy efficient , environmentally sound space and to send as little to the landfill as possible			0
they needed to stay within their budget -- $ 4.8 million to purchase and transform a building -- and refused to name spaces after donors , even if it would 've raised more money			1
in their synagogue , they wanted everyone to feel equal			1
" we really were able to think about how we wanted to do it and to make decisions over a period of time , " said @entity25 , who led the congregation 's building committee			1
" everything was done very deliberately			0
" or @entity123 and @entity124 , a married couple from @entity126 , set the tone for the contemporary design of the space , and members weighed in with their own ideas			0
they did n't want anything ornate or fancy , but where there 's color on the walls , it 's warm and bright			1
the lobby was built to feel welcoming , like a hotel			1
in the sanctuary , the walls and ceiling are artfully askew , " so your eye and mind can wander , " said @entity41 , the architect			2
the bema , the podium at the center of the room , is positioned to be wheelchair accessible and keep all members level			0
high windows obscure the parking lot surrounding the building but reveal a border of trees			2
skylights were placed to highlight the ark , the closet that holds the synagogue 's @entity161 scrolls , as well as its " infinite " glass door and the hebrew alphabet etched into it			1
the sanctuary was engineered to maximize acoustic performance			0
services at @entity168 often include music , and congregants speak to each other from across the room			0
in their old space , low drop ceilings meant they struggled to hear one another			0
now , their voices are loud and clear			0
" it 's really something amazing , " @entity25 said			2
" the ability to really be able to enjoy the rich sounds within the sanctuary is something that really makes a difference			0
" @entity12 moved into its new home at the end of february , after less than a year of construction			1
this month , the building was honored in the @entity1 chapter of the @entity189			2
visitors are often wowed by the change and stunned to learn the building 's history , said @entity194 , the congregation 's executive director			1
as much as members love the space , they love the story			2
" once we found a place in existence , the idea of repurposing made sense , " @entity194 said			0
" it 's nice to have room to spread out			2
" even now , there are reminders of the building 's past -- they kept the same footprint , and some of the original exterior walls , steel structure and concrete blocks remain visible			1
the old concrete floor is freshly polished , but watchful eyes can spot outlines of the former auto bays and windows where cars used to drive in			2
they kept the posts that used to guide cars inside , but painted them a warm red to contrast with the new gray exterior			0
even concrete in the new courtyard is original but cut to improve drainage and create a new look			0
the congregation is gradually growing into the building			2
flags still mark where plants and flowers will go in the ground , and the walls will remain clear of artwork until they better understand their own space			0
there are plans to improve classrooms and their kosher kitchen later , but they 're grateful now for a consistent space with room to grow			2
it 's a complete transformation , said @entity41 , the architect , even between the steel ceiling and concrete floor			1
" you have to transform it			0
if you leave it too much the same , it does n't have the potential to enlighten us , " @entity41 said			0
" we 're always trying to break out out of the big box we started with			1

@entity12 's synagogue is built from a former auto paint shop
the @entity19 - area synagogue is an example of adaptive reuse in architecture
architect : " we 're always trying to break out out of the big box we started with "
