@entity0 -- with its well - killing effort reported to be going " extremely well , " @entity2 plans to start pouring concrete into the crippled well in the @entity5 on thursday			1
the @entity7 official overseeing the response to the spill , retired adm. @entity10 , has given @entity2 a green light to pour cement on top of the 2,300 barrels of heavy drilling mud already sent down the well			1
the mud drove oil back into the reservoir in an operation known as a " static kill			1
" but @entity10 said @entity2 should follow that with a second well - killing procedure that has been in the works as sort of an insurance policy -- pouring additional mud and cement through a relief well that 's expected to be ready in mid-august			1
" based on the successful completion of the static kill procedure and a positive evaluation of the test results , i have authorized @entity2 to cement its damaged well , " @entity10 said wednesday in a statement			1
" i made it clear that implementation of this procedure shall in no way delay the completion of the relief well			2
" earlier wednesday , senior vice president @entity38 reported that the initial step in the static kill had gone " extremely well			1
" the company began pumping the mud tuesday afternoon , and the operation continued for some eight hours			0
@entity2 pumped mud into the well from a ship on the surface mostly at the rate of five barrels a minute			1
that eventually increased to 10 and then 15 barrels a minute near the end of the operation , according to @entity38			0
" everything proceeded exactly as we expected it to , " he said			0
the move essentially sealed the well , which had poured oil into the @entity5 for nearly three months until a tight - fitting cap was placed on it in @entity57			2
wednesday marked the 107th day since the worst environmental disaster in @entity7 history began with the explosion on the @entity61 that sank the rig and killed 11 workers			1
the government estimates that nearly 5 million barrels of crude oil spilled into the @entity5			0
but @entity38 noted that it has been 20 days since the well was fitted with a tightly - fitting cap , which stopped the oil from flowing and made it possible to permanently seal the well through the operations now under way			2
" it 's getting very difficult to find any oil on the surface , but i want to emphasize that @entity2 remains committed to getting this well permanently shut and cleaning up any pollution and restoring the @entity79 , " @entity38 said			1
" that was our commitment from the beginning , and we 're just as committed to that today			0
" while it may be difficult to find much oil on the surface for skimming ships to collect , local officials are quick to point out that coastal areas are still being affected			2
the @entity89 issued a report wednesday indicating that oil sheen and patches of oil are still being spotted in marshes and various coastal areas in @entity96 , @entity97 and @entity99 parishes			0
and in another development wednesday , @entity101 wildlife officials and the state 's @entity102 said two men had been arrested and accused of falsifying documents to file claims with @entity2			1
authorities said @entity109 , 36 , the owner of @entity111 , and @entity112 , 31 , falsified documents from january through april , reporting the sale of 6,347 pounds of crabs for $ 9,548.91 during that period -- in the months before the @entity61 explosion			0
according to the arrest warrant , @entity112 acknowledged receiving $ 5,000 checks from @entity2 in may and june			1
but the warrant said that when confronted by authorities , both men admitted they did not sell or purchase any crabs in the months leading up to the explosion , after it was pointed out that @entity112 did n't have a commercial fishing license during that time -- and only obtained one in may			0
the men , from the town of @entity128 , @entity101 , southwest of @entity129 , were booked tuesday in the @entity130			2
if convicted , they could face fines up to $ 5,000 and up to five years in jail			0
@entity2 has promised to compensate people impacted by the spill , and in a meeting with president @entity137 in june , @entity2 executives agreed to set up a $ 20 billion dollar fund for that purpose			2
meanwhile , @entity140 , director of the @entity141 , talked about the well - killing efforts on @entity1 's @entity143			1
she told @entity144 , " it 's not mission accomplished , but obviously , it 's an important day			0
" " we know the static kill worked , and we know we 're not going to have more oil leaking into the @entity5 , " she said			1
but she noted the relief well operation lies ahead , and said , " we also have the long - term restoration			1
so we 're just beginning one phase as we end one phase			0
" looking ahead to that next phase , coastal parish leaders and state officials in @entity101 submitted a transition plan to the @entity159 on long - range cleanup efforts			1
the plan was developed after a meeting last week with gov. @entity163 , coastal parish presidents , @entity159 officials and @entity2 chief operating officer @entity166			1
the plan notes that federal , state and local authorities all must agree that shorelines are clean , before the effort will stop			2
on that cleanup front , a government report released wednesday indicated that 74 percent of the oil that leaked from the well over nearly three months has been collected , has dispersed or has evaporated			2
several agencies were involved in the study including the @entity178 , the @entity179 and the @entity180			0
of the total amount of oil that spilled in the @entity5 -- the most recent estimate is 205.8 million gallons -- just 26 percent remains in the water , either on or just below the surface as a light sheen and weathered tar balls			0
of the remaining 26 percent , " much of that is in the process of being degraded and cleaned up on the shore , " said @entity188 , @entity178 administrator			0
the tar balls are either washing ashore , being collected from the coastlines , or buried in sand and sediment and are in the process of being degraded , the report said			0
@entity1 's @entity197 contributed to this report .			0
