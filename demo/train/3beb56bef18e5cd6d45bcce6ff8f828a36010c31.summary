-- for two years , @entity1 has pushed its @entity2 as more than a social network or cool video - chatting tool			1
this week , it is working to hammer home that point with a spate of new features			0
@entity2 is n't an answer to @entity10 or @entity11 , @entity1 says			1
it 's the connective tissue that more and more is tying @entity1 's most popular products together -- and it will not be ignored			1
since it debuted in june 2011 , @entity2 has seeped into all other parts of the @entity1 ecosystem , tying into other @entity1 offerings like search , @entity18 and @entity19			1
sometimes the product feels like an invasive species , especially when using it is required to benefit from the coolest features in other @entity1 products			1
" i 'm not sure that it 's forced			0
i think there are some people who may have a misunderstanding of what we 're trying to accomplish , " said @entity26 , the @entity1 senior vice president who leads @entity2			1
creating one unified @entity1 identity for each user is the primary purpose of @entity2			1
when the project was started , the company was trying to solve the problem of disconnected online identities			0
" one of the core insights we had when we started @entity2 was that @entity1 itself was deeply fragmented , " said @entity26			1
" @entity1 treated identity as something that was fragmented and different , when ( people ) were on @entity19 they had one identity , when they were on @entity47 they had a different identity , when they were on @entity18 they were someone else , when they used search they were n't even logged in			1
" but the reality is that many people still have multiple online identities and @entity18 addresses			0
there might be one for work , another for personal , and a dedicated e-mail address for signing up for services and e-mail lists to collect all the resulting spam in one convenient bucket			0
instead of giving those up and using one @entity1 identity , many people choose to juggle their accounts			1
to get people to use google+ the way @entity1 imagines it , the company is working to make the benefits of using one primary @entity1 identity too good to ignore			2
during wednesday 's @entity75 developer 's conference keynote address , @entity2 played a big part in many of the more exciting product announcements , even though it was n't always called out			1
the redesigned version of @entity80 will recommend restaurants based on what your @entity2 friends have reviewed and visited			2
the new @entity86 service will also use your social graph to hone in on music you might enjoy			0
" that unification of @entity1 , of bringing @entity1 together , makes for amazing things , " said @entity26			1
one feature demonstrated on stage was a voice search for a person 's recent vacation photos			0
if you are logged into @entity97 under the same e-mail you use for @entity2 , and if you also use @entity2 to upload and share your personal photos , you can get these types of customized search results			2
those tie - ins could play a more important role in getting people to embrace , not just grudgingly accept , @entity2 than the service 's stand - alone features			2
however , a lot is being done to improve the stand - alone @entity2 experience			2
on wednesday , @entity1 unveiled a sleek new redesign , some very impressive photo tools , and a feature that automatically combs posts on the social network and adds appropriate hashtags			1
in an impressive googley twist , it can even identify what 's in a photograph to add hashtags like " concert " or " cat			0
" when there is breaking news , like the @entity125 bombing , people will refer to it with different terms and finding out more information requires you to leave @entity2			2
that 's in stark contrast to @entity11 , current king of breaking news , where hashtags and discovery tools make it easy to stay on top of important events in real time			2
" you 've got to figure out how to canonicalize that ' bombing in @entity125 , ' ' disaster boston , ' ' marathon disaster , ' are all the same thing			0
and you have to bring all of that together and then say , this is the recommended tag			0
and if you click on it , we understand the related entities			0
that 's a deep understanding of the knowledge graph			0
in real time , as its happening , " said @entity26 in addition to trying to clean up user identities and make @entity2 a more engaging experience , @entity2 is also unifying existing @entity1 products that overlap			1
the new @entity157 messenger service allows people to chat via text , share photos , and talk over video with one or multiple people , between phones , tablets and desktops			0
instead of separate products for @entity157 , @entity169 and @entity169 , there is just one tool			0
this new product could take on existing chat platforms like @entity173 and @entity174 , though @entity26 said that was n't its main goal			1
" obviously , we knew that there were real time communications products			0
we 're not going to tell you we did n't know that there were these products out there			0
we were watching the growth of them and that was powerful data for us , that there was a need out there for a better solution , " said @entity26			2
" frankly we were looking at our own problems , and our customers were telling us , @entity1 : unify these things " @entity26 said .			1

@entity1 senior vice president @entity26 *explains* the real goal behind @entity2
all the big @entity1 product announcements tied into the social network in some small way
the social network is @entity1 's attempt to clean up fragmented user accounts
