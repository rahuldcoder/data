some of @entity2 's @entity1 neighbors are frustrated by the @entity4 's insurance marketplaces but not for the reasons you might expect			1
@entity2 is an insurance broker			2
he still has his share of frustrations with the marketplace websites , but the growing number of complaints he hears come from clients and fellow brokers who have seen the policies these marketplaces offer			1
nationally the marketplaces offer tens of thousands of different policies with a wide variety of coverage , but @entity2 has noticed many have one thing in common : they cover a narrow network of doctors and hospitals			1
@entity4 sign - up more than a phone call away that narrower network comes as particularly bad news for the residents of @entity31 , @entity1			1
@entity31 's one hospital wo n't accept any policies offered by the marketplaces			1
to see a doctor , specialist or primary care provider affiliated with the hospital , patients on these @entity4 plans will have to pay out of their own pocket			1
the closest in - network hospital is in @entity43			1
" can you imagine having to go 25 miles away to @entity43 to get access to a health care provider that is covered by your insurance ? " @entity2 asked			2
" right now , @entity31 is one big black hole of health care for people buying these plans			1
" @entity52 : what works , what does n't and it 's not just @entity31			2
nationally , consumers are learning a number of well - known hospitals wo n't accept insurance offered through the marketplaces			1
in @entity62 , @entity61 will accept only a minority of the plans			1
in @entity67 , @entity66 medical centers will accept a couple			1
in @entity70 , @entity69 has limited the number of plans it will take			1
academic medical centers are often pricier because they tackle the more complex cases			0
@entity76 , a @entity77 insurer offering policies in 14 states , is narrowing its networks in many markets after research showed consumers care more about the price than the provider			1
a survey done by @entity87 found that 43 % of those surveyed considered the cost of the policy the most important factor when they pick a health insurance plan			0
what we learned -- and did n't -- from @entity4 website but the picture is n't all bleak			1
" some coverage is better than no coverage , " said @entity98 , an economist and professor of health policy at @entity101			1
@entity104 gives the @entity4 marketplaces high marks overall since it is a lot easier to compare plans in these marketplaces than when consumers were buying insurance on their own			1
with the standardized essential benefits offered by all plans , " you can be a little bit more assured that @entity115 and @entity116 will provide decent coverage			1
" " we 're going to get better benefits in this market , " said @entity120 , an economist at @entity121 who was an architect on both the @entity122 and @entity124 health plans			1
" right now , in this insurance market , not only is it discriminatory , but the typical person with an individual - payer plan has a very weak insurance plan			2
... it 's not real insurance			0
we 're going to get rid of that -- everyone will have guaranteed , real insurance			2
" @entity4 open enrollment : here 's everything you need to know in the case of @entity141 , the ceo and president wrote a letter to the local newspaper explaining that his hospital was n't opting out of @entity4 as a " political statement			1
" instead , @entity148 blamed @entity149 , the state exchange 's only provider , for being " unwilling to negotiate sustainable contract terms			0
" the hospital , he wrote , would be " paid less than what it costs us to provide care , " and said his advisers told him the facility should be cautious about " committing to rates that could be detrimental to one 's organization			0
" @entity31 is not the only @entity1 city with a limited network of providers			2
@entity166 's hospital is n't taking the insurance either			0
and only one of the two major hospitals in @entity170 is in - network , according to @entity2			1
dr. @entity172 : 5 surprises from @entity175 interview " that 's a big frustration to my clients who heard their president promise that if you like your doctor you can keep them , " @entity2 said			0
" sure , you can keep them if you pay cash for their services			0
but if you want your new insurance to cover that doctor visit , forget it			0
you 're going to have to switch			2
" in selling his health care plan to the nation , president @entity189 did offer a " guarantee " that " if you 've got a doctor that you like , you will be able to keep your doctor			0
" the @entity52 site is more specific in its section " can i keep my own doctor ? " it explains , " depending on the plan you choose in the @entity200 , you may be able to keep your current doctor			0
different plans have different networks and providers			2
" " may , " of course , differs from a " guarantee			0
" @entity207 : doctor choice in @entity4 ? not so much " across the board , the networks and the @entity216 ( preferred provider organizations ) are significantly narrower than people are used to , " said @entity209 , a senior policy adviser dealing with health policies for @entity213 's @entity212 , a business - sponsored public policy advocacy group			1
" narrower networks is one way to keep costs ( of these policies ) down			0
some of the networks may be too thin , at least for now anyway			0
" provisions in the health care reform law say there has to be an adequate number of providers offered in these insurance networks			0
" it still remains to be seen if that happens , " said @entity104 of @entity231			0
" in principle , you could n't exclude all obstetricians , for instance			0
that plan would not be considered adequate			0
" as the marketplaces are around longer , more providers may opt into the system , according to dr. @entity242 , head of the @entity243 , a trade group that represents multiple physician medical practices			2
the hidden truth behind early @entity4 numbers the group 's survey of its members in september found that more than 40 % were still deciding if they were going to accept the insurance offered through the @entity4 marketplaces			1
" many of the practices are still struggling to know what it means for them , " @entity242 said			0
the association suggests that people who already have a doctor call to see if they will accept a particular policy			2
" we know a number of our members have trained their staff to answer those kinds of questions			0
" if someone does n't have a doctor , online resources can help with selecting one			0
while providers are limited with these plans , in the long run @entity104 said she believes " it 's actually a good thing to reward higher quality , lower cost providers " as that could ultimately cut the cost of health care as the reform legislation intended			2
doctor shortage , increased demand could crash health care system			0

insurers in @entity4 marketplaces providing fewer in - network doctors , experts say
" ( but ) we 're going to get better benefits , " economist says
consumers should check with doctors to see if they accept marketplace plans
