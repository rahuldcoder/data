@entity0 -- a private marketing firm has been temporarily blocked from using president @entity4 's familiar " @entity5 " campaign logo , after the @entity4 campaign committee filed a trademark infringement lawsuit			1
federal judge @entity8 has issued a preliminary injunction , preventing @entity0 - based @entity10 from selling a variety of merchandise -- hats , buttons , balloons and t - shirts -- with the red - and - blue image , without the permission of @entity4 for @entity19 , the president 's re-election campaign			1
in his three - page order , the judge said that for now , the company can not use the trademark or " confusingly similar " images in its products , including " engaging in any course of conduct with respect to the 2008 @entity31 that is likely to mislead the public into believing that the products marketed and / or offered for sale by defendants are , sponsored , authorized , or otherwise approved by " the @entity4 campaign			1
re-election officials filed suit on june 1 , and a preliminary hearing was held monday			0
further hearings are scheduled later this month			0
@entity4 officials said the issue was time - sensitive , since this kind of merchandise is typically sold in the six months leading up to the november elections			0
the campaign itself sells its own merchandise through the store.barackobama.com website , including the logo that shows the letter " o " decorated with a blue half - circle and red stripes			2
the @entity4 team said people buying products through its official website also provide contact information , which the campaign can then use to solicit further monetary donations			2
" defendants are using the @entity65 on merchandise in a deliberate and willful attempt to draw on the goodwill and commercial magnetism of the @entity65 and the @entity70 , " lawyers for @entity4 said in federal court briefs			0
on tuesday , the @entity10 website still featured products with the " @entity5 " image , including a " veterans for @entity4 " button listed as a " top seller			2
" the parent company @entity77 has been retailing material supporting @entity80 candidates since 1985			0
the company denies any wrongdoing , arguing in court filings that the @entity4 campaign had known of the alleged trademark infringement since 2007 and can not now claim " immediate harm " from continued use of the logo by private companies			1
@entity77 suggested that a federal political campaign logo would be in the public domain , not subject to trademark restrictions			1
the case is @entity94 ( 12 - cv - 889 )			0

judge says website ca ***n't*** sell merchandise with the image without campaign 's permission
he says company ca ***n't*** mislead public into believing its products are sponsored by campaign
