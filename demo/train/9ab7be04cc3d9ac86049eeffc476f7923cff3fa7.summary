-- from the air , the @entity2 desert looks like it has a bad case of chicken pox			1
spread across 1,100 miles of a narrow strip sit a smattering of barren polka dots , otherwise known as fairy circles			1
these sizable craters measure 10 - to 65 - feet in diameter , and represent one of nature 's greatest mysteries			2
over the decades , a number of theories , from alien invasion to poisonous gasses have been put forth to explain the phenomenon			0
last year , a study published in the journal @entity22 made headlines by claiming sand termites were the culprit			1
none of these , however , have been fully proven			0
" the point is , fairy circles are still a mystery			1
there 's been lots of work done in the field and in labs , but none could solve the issue , " says @entity30 , a scientist from the @entity31 in @entity32 , @entity33			1
nature on repeat @entity30 , along with a team of @entity45 experts , recently put forth a theory of their own			2
using aerial photography , they were able to study the spatial patterns of the fairy circles			1
the consistency and breadth of their distribution put him in mind of other landscapes whose vegetation , from a distance , also resembles a textile designer 's sketchpad			0
" if you go to @entity65 and type in ' tiger bush ' , you 'll find aerial images of a county in @entity69 where the vegetation forms in striped patterns			0
in @entity73 , you have [ areas with grass circles known as ] spinifex grass , " he notes			0
" a few days ago , a professor in @entity78 sent me an example of ring - like patterns formed in the @entity81			0
" @entity30 hypothesizes @entity2 's fairy circles are formed through a similar phenomenon : self - organization			1
basically , in arid climates , where water is scarce and soil nutrient - poor , plants face stiffer competition for resources			1
as a result , they " organize " themselves at a distance to maximize what limited resources are available -- ultimately forming strongly ordered patterns on the landscape			2
debunking the termite the self - organization theory comes about a year after biology professor @entity101 argued in a paper published in @entity22 that fairy circles were the work of a species of sand termite , psammotermes allocerus			1
@entity101 ' argument went that they created an underground oasis for themselves by eating the grass roots and killing them , thereby causing a subterranean water trap ( without vegetation , water does n't evaporate and remains underground )			0
@entity30 finds the explanation unlikely			0
" i do n't want to overstate things , " he says			0
" but there is not a single study showing that social insects can cause such large - scale homogenous distribution patterns , as revealed by our study , " adds @entity30			0
" whereas all insect studies showed large - scale clumping of nest locations , self - organization in itself can cause homogenous spacing at those scales and even beyond to several kilometers			0
" @entity101 based his findings on the fact that p. allocerus were the only insect species found consistently across the full stretch of desert where the circles are present , and were especially abundant around the circles			2
though a tempting explanation , some experts remain unconvinced			0
" there is a high correlation between fairy circles and these termites , and therefore @entity101 claimed that they 're the cause			1
but it 's just a correlation , and one of the most fundamental mistakes a scientist can make is to confuse correlation with causation , " says @entity146 , a biology professor at @entity147 who specializes in both social insect behavior and fairy circles			1
" the termite theory is very appealing to people , because it 's relatively easy to understand , whereas self - organization requires some knowledge or intuition for how plants work , " he adds			2

*strange* barren dots -- *rimmed* with tall grasses -- sprinkle a 1,100 - mile stretch of @entity2 's desert
these are known as fairy circles , and their cause remains a mystery
last year , a theory that termites caused the circles made *international* headlines
a @entity33 scientist thinks competition for resources is the cause
