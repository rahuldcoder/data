-- injustice has no borders , as we at @entity4 know well from years of experience working in more than 90 countries			1
we also know that poverty has no political party in our own country , the @entity10			2
last week @entity4 released a new study that dispels many of the political myths surrounding the nation 's minimum wage debate			1
it shows not only that increasing the federal minimum wage from $ 7.25 to $ 10.10 per hour would give some 25 million workers across @entity10 a much - needed raise , but also that , on average , one in five workers in every single congressional district in @entity10 -- red or blue -- would benefit from such a raise			1
in fact , according to our data , a hike in the minimum wage would benefit more than 55,000 workers in the average congressional district			1
we found that the workers who would gain most are concentrated in districts that are remarkably diverse , from highly condensed urban areas to poor rural areas			0
at the top of the list is @entity35 ( 31.8 % of workers ) , followed by the largely rural south coastal district in @entity39 ' @entity38 ( 29.9 % of workers )			2
a district in the @entity42 of @entity43 is next , followed by more districts in @entity35 and the @entity42			0
next on the list are districts in @entity47 ( 28.8 % of workers ) , the @entity49 of @entity50 ( 28.5 % of workers ) , @entity52 ( 27.9 % of workers ) , the @entity54 ( 27.6 % of workers ) , and the boot heel of @entity57 ( 27.3 % of workers )			0
raising the minimum wage would equally help @entity10 who live in @entity61 and @entity62 districts , rural and metropolitan			1
it would also pump money into the economy and save billions in taxpayer dollars by reducing the number of low - wage workers receiving federal assistance			1
it seems an obvious thing to do			0
from 1938 , when a federal minimum wage was established , to its most recent increase in 2007 -- passed by overwhelming majorities in @entity74 and signed into law by president @entity80 -- most members of @entity74 recognized that as the cost of living goes up , so should the minimum wage			1
so why has the issue become bogged down in partisan politics that do little to serve our people or our future ? we are lucky enough to live in a wealthy democracy , but @entity4 is seeing the same growing problem of inequality in @entity10 that we see in developing countries : relatively few people hold more and more power			1
in principle , the @entity10 is the land where all people are created equal			2
but in reality , political power is stacked in favor of the wealthy			0
because of this imbalance , millions of hard - working @entity10 ca n't stop falling behind , working at jobs that pay under $ 10 per hour and rarely offer benefits -- some not even a day of paid sick leave			2
our study found that at least one - fourth of @entity10 work at jobs that pay so little that they can not sustain themselves and their families without turning to government programs or going into debt			2
the average age of a worker who would benefit from a minimum wage increase is 35			1
most ( 55 % ) are women			0
over a third are parents of dependent children			0
these are people like @entity118 , a single mother of four in @entity119 , @entity120 , who , according to a @entity122 article in november , was making $ 7.75 an hour as a shift manager at a fast - food restaurant			0
or @entity125 , a father of two in @entity127 , @entity128 , who made $ 9 an hour as an assistant manager at a pizza chain			0
they work these jobs year after year , while trying to care for their own children and parents , struggling to pay their bills			0
for them and people like them , the @entity139 is a distant mirage			0
according to our analysis , raising the minimum wage to $ 10.10 would lift more than 5 million @entity10 out of poverty and help 14 million children see a boost in their family income			1
fourteen million women , including 6 million working mothers , would get a raise			0
three million single parents would be better able to sustain their families			0
the sad irony of the standoff in @entity74 over raising the minimum wage is that petty partisanship gets in the way of a deal that would benefit large numbers of constituents in every congressional district , seemingly a boon to elected representatives of both parties			1
at least , that has been the logic that led to bipartisan support for increasing the minimum wage 22 times before now			1
members of @entity74 from each party need to be willing to overcome the divide : to be open to the debate , to consider the needs of hard - working constituents and taxpayers , to consider the wide range of benefits -- and ultimately , to give a raise to the people who need it the most .			2

@entity4 study : minimum wage hike would help people in every congressional district
@entity188 says it would benefit 55,000 *+* workers in average congressional district
it would help economy , get people off assistance , he says -- so why the partisan stalling ?
*writer* : @entity74 hiked minimum wage 22 times before ; it must now as a boon to @entity10
