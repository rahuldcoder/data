-- @entity1 on friday joined the growing number of states where federal judges have struck down same - sex marriage bans			1
the decision was cheered by lesbian and gay rights advocates , but it 's not necessarily a final victory			0
the @entity1 ban violates the @entity10 , said @entity12 district judge @entity11			2
she said same - sex couples " are entitled to the same treatment as any heterosexual couple			2
" " i conclude that the @entity1 laws prohibiting marriage between same - sex couples interfere with plaintiffs ' right to marry , in violation of the due process clause , and discriminate against plaintiffs on the basis of sexual orientation , in violation of the ( @entity10 's ) equal protection clause , " the judge wrote			1
@entity11 did not immediately stay her own ruling , as some other federal judges issuing similar decisions have done , nor did she state that it takes effect right away			0
@entity1 attorney general @entity33 said the current law restricting marriage to one man and one woman , which is written into the @entity1 state constitution , " remains in force			1
