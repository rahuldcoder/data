-- if kings and queens are able to savor the best things in life , why should n't they get to retire , too ? it 's not traditional , and it kind of goes against one of the biggest perks of being a king or queen -- a secure job for life			1
but it happens , as the world saw monday			1
king juan carlos i of spain became the latest royal to say he 's stepping down			1
it 's " time to hand over to a new generation , " the 76 - year - old announced in a televised address , declaring that he 's leaving the job he 's had for nearly four decades			1
his son , crown prince @entity21 , 46 , will take over			2
the @entity23 king is one of several monarchs to step down in recent years			1
@entity25 takes her leave in january 2013 , queen @entity27 passed the crown to her son prince @entity29			1
he was 46 at the time			2
queen @entity27 had been ruling for more than three decades			2
much beloved by the @entity32 people , she tried to assure them that her retirement did n't mean she was taking off for @entity35 and forsaking their love			1
" this does n't mean that i 'm taking leave from you , " she told a throng of admirers in @entity40 outside the palace in @entity42			2
her abdication was a move marked by tradition in the @entity32 -- knowing that it 's best to go out while on top , historians say			1
queen @entity27 was the third successive @entity32 monarch to abdicate , following her grandmother and her mother			1
" @entity27 's abdication was n't controversial , " explained royal commentator and historian @entity55			1
" the people were happy with that and no one thought less of the monarchy			2
" a father to son handoff in @entity63 in july 2013 , @entity64 gave up his kingship , reportedly over concerns that he was too old to carry out his duties			1
those duties include " suggesting , advising , warning and encouraging " lawmakers in the country , according to @entity63 's government website			1
@entity64 was 79 when he retired			2
he had ruled for 20 years			0
his son , a 53 - year - old trained fighter pilot who became @entity73 , took over			0
the country had been in turmoil at the time , torn between the @entity76 where residents spoke different languages			0
a pope quits ( and makes history ) @entity81 must have been especially lovely in 2013 , because even the @entity82 did n't want to keep working			1
an unprecedented " i quit " came in february when the @entity84 announced that @entity82 @entity85 -- @entity86 's @entity85 -- was leaving the papacy			1
his " advanced age " was the reason he wanted out , the @entity84 said			0
the then - 85 - year - old had led the @entity92 since 2005			0
he became the first pope in nearly 600 years to leave the post			0
so what do monarchs -- and one pope -- do when they retire ? @entity85 's retirement has n't been all that different from anyone else 's			1
archbishop @entity102 told @entity103 that @entity85 has been doing a lot of reading , reflecting and praying			0
he 's taking walks in the @entity84 gardens , playing the piano and receiving guests at a monastery			1
he 's mostly a homebody , making only a few public appearances , such as the canonization ceremonies for @entity82 @entity114 and @entity115 in april			1
a change of the guard in @entity118 sheikh @entity119 , the emir of @entity118 , abdicated and transferred power to his son in 2013			1
@entity119 , who gained power in 1995 after overthrowing his father , sent out a public message to announce his plans			0
" i declare that i will hand over the reins of power to @entity128 and i am fully certain that he is up to the responsibility , deserving the confidence , capable of shouldering the responsibility and fulfilling the mission , " according to the @entity134			0
@entity119 's decision to cede power willingly was a first in the modern history of the region			1
the norm is for @entity142 leaders to rule for decades until their death or until circumstances conspire to overthrow them , such as the @entity146 uprisings that toppled leaders in @entity148 , @entity149 and @entity150			0
his son , @entity128 , became the youngest monarch in the region at the age of 33			0
@entity23 selfies and change in @entity23 on monday after the @entity157 announced his departure , tourists took selfies in front of the royal palace in @entity161			1
some gazed through the gates			0
" change is good , new blood could be good , why not ? " said @entity163			0
" everything is so unpredictable , you think about politicians that offer you one thing and give you another and things continue to work			1
" @entity173 told @entity103 that she worried about what the abdication indicated			0
" it 's a shame			1
i 'm really sorry , " she said			0
" i do n't know what 's going to become of @entity23 and i do n't like what i see coming			1
" on monday , the @entity157 noted in his speech that @entity23 had been suffering financially			1
" the long , deep economic crisis we are going through has left a lot of scars socially , but it has also pointed toward a future of hope , " he said			0
@entity187 called @entity189 ' abdication a " real tragedy			0
" " he wanted to go down in history as the king who was a symbol of national unity for a very disparate @entity23 , " @entity55 said			2
" @entity23 -- many of them older -- are great admirers of him			0
" there was still a " tremendous amount of good will " toward the @entity157 , he said , despite scandals that had lately rocked his rule			0
@entity189 ' popularity took a hit in 2012 when he fell and broke his hip while on a trip in @entity207 , and @entity23 news outlets began running a photo from the trip that showed him next to an elephant he had shot			0
the image appalled many @entity23			0
@entity55 recalled monday , however , that the @entity157 had , in his long rule , managed to bring together fractious political groups in @entity23 and stop a right - wing military coup in 1981			2
" he 's done the country enormous service , " @entity55 said			2
could a @entity222 royal be next ? the news of @entity189 ' abdication did n't shock @entity222 author and historian @entity226			2
" we 've seen this in @entity63 and the @entity32 , " she said			1
" i think it 's often thought that rule should go to someone who is young and vibrant and fun			2
but you will never see it in the @entity222			0
" @entity235 has said that she believes the job of ruling @entity222 was given to her by @entity238 , and only @entity238 can take it away , @entity226 said			1
the queen staying in her job is critical to a cohesive sense of culture in @entity222 , she said			0
but it 's happened before in the @entity222 there 's no way @entity235 does n't consider the shock waves sent through @entity222 society when @entity248 abdicated in 1936			1
that " haunts " the palace still , @entity55 said			0
@entity248 caused a huge stir when he declared that he wanted to marry @entity253 divorcee @entity252 , an act that broke the rules of the @entity256			0
he gave up the throne and became the @entity258			2
together , the couple toured @entity86			0
it was reported that the former king had @entity263 sympathies			2
he lived out the rest of his life in @entity266			0
the episode is considered , @entity55 said , a shame on the legacy of the @entity222 monarchy .			0

@entity32 , @entity63 and @entity118 all had monarchs step down in 2013
