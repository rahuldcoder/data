-- avoid the mile - long lines at the @entity3 tkts booth by buying discounted @entity5 tickets using one of these eight approaches			1
lining up at the @entity3 tkts booth is n't the only way to get discounted @entity5 tickets			2
crack the codes when you 're buying tickets online , the major agencies -- telecharge and @entity14 -- ask for a promotional code , which can shave between 25 and 50 percent off the face - value price			1
you can find one of these codes by visiting @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22			0
these sites list promotional codes for many shows , including blockbuster productions like " @entity27			0
" @entity20 and @entity21 are more comprehensive but require registration			0
@entity22 posts a more limited number of codes , but you wo n't have to cough up any personal information			0
insider 's tip : if you buy directly from a theater box office , where you can also use a code for savings , you will avoid the fees that @entity41 and @entity14 slap on the tickets they sell online			2
try a ticket broker if you 're gunning for one of @entity5 's most popular shows , such as " @entity47 " or " @entity48 , " you 're going to struggle to find discounted tickets from any source			1
your best hope is to look for tickets during @entity5 's slow months : january , february , september and october			2
you 'll most likely find these tickets being resold by respected online ticket brokers , such as @entity55 and @entity56 -- often , though not always , at a discount to their face values			1
buck the system at the 11th hour general rush tickets and ticket lotteries are available to anyone looking to try his or her last - minute luck			1
some productions , including " @entity67 " and " @entity68 , " sell a select number of discounted tickets , called rush tickets , at the box office on the day of the show			1
others , such as " @entity75 " and " @entity76 , " hold lotteries in which people go to the theater a few hours before a show and enter their names in a drawing			2
@entity83 and lottery tickets usually cost between $ 20 and $ 30			1
go to @entity85 or @entity20 for details on the rush and lottery practices of the top productions			2
sit onstage two popular musicals offer onstage seating at a fraction of the standard prices			1
" @entity48 " sells 26 onstage seats at every performance for $ 31.50 a pop ( which is far less than the typical $ 70 a seat ) ; " @entity100 " sells 22 onstage seats for every performance at $ 41.50 apiece			1
these seats tend to have rear or side views that obscure some of the action , but they still sell out quickly because viewers get to sit so close			0
it 's best to book " @entity48 " onstage seats about four months in advance ; " @entity100 " onstage seats require a lead time of a week or two			2
onstage seating is available at the box offices as well as through @entity41			1
tote the tots kids have some clout when it comes to ticket discounts			2
the @entity116 sells tickets for children under the age of 17 at half the price it charges adults			2
for example , in february a child 's ticket costs only $ 25 for " @entity128 " -- while an adult ticket is $ 50 ( for a rear mezzanine seat in each case )			1
every winter , the @entity129 holds @entity131			0
this year , anyone between the ages of 6 and 18 could see a @entity5 show for free , when accompanied by a full - paying adult , on february 5 , 6 , 12 and 13			0
take a stand for theatergoers feeling light on their feet , sold - out shows can be a good thing			0
many productions -- even hot shows like " @entity146 " and " @entity147 " -- offer standing room only ( @entity150 ) admission when no audience seats are left			0
like rush tickets , most @entity150 tickets fall in the $ 20 to $ 30 range and can be purchased at the box office on the day of the show			1
find out which productions offer @entity150 by visiting @entity85 and @entity20			0
become a member the nonprofit @entity159 -- which also operates the red - and - white tkts booths in @entity3 and at the @entity161 that sell discounted , same - day tickets -- has a @entity159 membership program that offers advance tickets for less than $ 35 for some @entity5 shows ( without the hassle of standing in a line )			1
to join , you have to be a student , a teacher , a union member , a senior , a civil service employee , a nonprofit or performing arts organization employee or a member of the armed forces or clergy			0
there 's an annual membership fee of $ 27.50 , but you can usually make up the difference in a single show , given that the average @entity5 ticket goes for $ 76			1
find membership details at @entity183			0
act your age students should check out theater company web sites to see if any discounts are available			0
for example , the @entity116 's @entity190 program offers $ 20 tickets , generally available two to three weeks before performances , for students and working professionals ages 18 to 35			1
sign up for the program at @entity197 ; membership is free			0
similarly , @entity201 's @entity200 program offers $ 20 advance tickets for high school and college students			1
however , a limited number of people are accepted into the free program before membership closes every year ; go to lct.org for more info			0
on occasion , a specific production , instead of a theater , will offer students discount tickets			1
for instance , @entity220 's " @entity219 " has been selling $ 26.50 student tickets at the box office of the @entity218			2
student rush is a final , tried - and - true method			2
many theaters set aside a limited number of student tickets -- typically running between $ 20 and $ 30 -- to sell at the box office on the day of the performance			1
