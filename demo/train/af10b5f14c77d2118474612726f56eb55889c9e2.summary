-- @entity2 striker @entity1 continued his superb scoring streak this season , netting another double as @entity6 beat @entity8 champions @entity7 2 - 1 in the @entity9 to clinch top spot in @entity11 and secure qualification for the last 16			1
captain @entity13 had already found the net 15 times for @entity6 this season , and he added another one to his tally in the 49th minute when he headed home after some superb individual play on the left from @entity20			1
and @entity13 wrapped up a comfortable night for the @entity21 when scoring his 17th goal from just 18 matches , tapping home from close range after @entity27 's corner had been flicked on at the near post by @entity29			0
@entity7 did pull one back through @entity30 with the final kick of the game , but it was too late to make a difference as @entity6 made it eight wins and a draw from their last nine matches , following a poor start to the season			1
@entity40 needs to be given more time @entity6 are on 11 points , four clear of @entity45 champions @entity43 , who stunned @entity47 1 - 0 in @entity48			1
@entity49 netted a late winner to leave @entity43 third on six points , one point behind @entity47 , with @entity7 bottom of the table on four points			2
however , there is a scenario that could see all those teams finish on seven points , if @entity43 draw with @entity6 and @entity7 defeat @entity47 in the final group matches in a fortnight			1
meanwhile , there was drama in @entity66 , with @entity67 scoring a last - gasp winner against @entity69 to virtually secure their place in the last 16 with a 2 - 1 victory			1
an injury time header from defender @entity74 saw the home side fight back from going a goal down , to inflict @entity69 's fourth defeat in seven matches and increase the pressure on under - fire manager @entity40			0
the visitors went ahead three minutes after the break when @entity82 turned smartly in the area before firing into the bottom corner of the net			0
but the @entity8 side levelled in the 73rd minute when substitute @entity87 headed into an empty net after goalkeeper @entity89 came off his line to try and intercept @entity92 's superb cross			0
and @entity74 rose highest from a corner in the dying stages to secure a stunning comeback for @entity67			0
that result leaves @entity67 on nine points , one clear of @entity69 and @entity98 , who crushed @entity100 7 - 0 at the @entity101			1
@entity102 scored a first - half hat - trick for the @entity105 side to leave qualification finely poised			0
if @entity69 beat @entity98 , or draw 0 - 0 at @entity108 in their final match , they will qualify , while @entity67 need to avoid defeat against @entity100 to also go through			1
defending champions @entity111 had already secured qualification , but a 3 - 2 victory over @entity113 at the @entity114 ensured they will go through as @entity116 winners , with @entity113 in second place			1
@entity111 took a 14th minute lead when @entity119 turned @entity121 's cross into his own net but @entity113 leveled six minutes later when @entity111 old boy @entity124 's shot crept under goalkeeper @entity125			2
@entity126 restored @entity111 's lead from the penalty spot in the 31st minute after @entity129 had fouled @entity130 in the area , but once again @entity113 equalized with a superb individual goal from @entity133			2
however , @entity111 were not to be denied and they clinched the win when @entity126 picked out @entity130 , who expertly slotted home			0
in the other group game , @entity137 side @entity136 secured their first - ever competition win with a 1 - 0 success at @entity141 , to move onto four points , while @entity141 remain bottom on two points			2
meanwhile , outsiders @entity146 have become the first @entity148 club to reach the last 16 after a 0 - 0 @entity149 draw at @entity151 side @entity150			0
@entity146 , who were completely unfancied going into the group stage , held their nerve in a highly - charged atmosphere , which saw play halted twice when smoke bombs covered the whole pitch making it impossible to carry on			0
the result means @entity146 have nine points from their five matches , one ahead of @entity150 and two clear of @entity163 , who won 2 - 0 at @entity165 in the other group match			2
@entity163 entertain @entity150 in their final group game , with the winners going through alongside @entity146 , although a draw would also see @entity150 go through .			0

@entity6 reach @entity9 *knockout* stage after 2 - 1 victory over @entity7
@entity1 scores twice to keep up his *remarkable* tally of goals this season
@entity67 beat @entity69 2 - 1 with a last - minute winner to virtually seal their place in last 16
*holders* @entity111 win 3 - 2 at @entity113 to ensure they will finish as @entity116 winners
