-- @entity1 claimed @entity3 's first ever medal in the men 's @entity5 triathlon , taking gold ahead of two - time world champion @entity8 and his brother @entity9 , who won bronze despite incurring a 15 second penalty			1
it marked @entity14 's 19th gold medal of the @entity15 , matching the number they landed in @entity18 four years ago			1
the elder of the two brothers , @entity21 , recovered from months out with injury to take his first olympic gold medal in a grueling event that comprises a 1.5km swim , 43km bike ride and a 10km run			1
the 24 - year - old clocked a time of one hour 45 minutes and 23 seconds to edge out @entity8 and could afford to grab a @entity31 flag from the crowd and canter through the final 100 meters			1
@entity9 , 22 , had to receive medical treatment after the race but showed guts and determination to take third after being penalized for mounting his bike too soon after the swim			2
all the action from day eleven with our @entity42 live blog @entity21 's triumph was soon followed by another as @entity46 , @entity47 and @entity48 helped @entity3 win the team dressage event in @entity50			1
" it feels a bit underwhelming in a way because @entity9 has collapsed and he 's not feeling too good , " @entity21 told the host broadcaster after the race			1
" that race was just unbelievable			0
i felt in control right from the start			0
and the crowds , i do n't think i 've ever come across anything anywhere near like that and i doubt i ever will again			0
" my ears are still ringing with the noise			0
it 's been talked about so much that @entity3 have n't won a triathlon medal so the pressure was stacked up			1
" to get two of us , two @entity71 brothers , on the podium -- you could n't ask for any more			0
" both brothers finished the end of the swimming leg in the leading pack but @entity9 was handed a penalty for mounting his bike too early after leaving @entity81 's @entity80			1
at the end of the 43km bike stage both were at the front as @entity71 teammate @entity86 played the role of pace setter			0
@entity21 moved away from the field in the early stages of the 10km run , allowing @entity9 to leave enough of a cushion to serve his 15 second penalty and rejoin the race clear in third			1
the elder brother ended with a time of 29 minutes and seven seconds in the 10km run -- just over a minute and a half slower than compatriot @entity99 who won the 10,000 meters on saturday			2
@entity100 said he had purposely ran a fast opening lap to give his brother the best chance to win a medal			0
he added : " we knew he had a penalty early in the bike and i was telling him ' calm down , you can still easily get on the podium with a 15 second penalty			0
' " i took the first lap of the run out really hard to try and get @entity9 as far away from the others as i could			2
@entity8 was having a great race again today so there was not much we could do about that			0
" @entity9 is fine , triathlon is a tough sport and we 've both been in that position			2
i think it was deceptively hard today , obviously it was fast but with this humid , muggy day , it dehydrates you and he was right on the edge at the finish			0

@entity1 wins gold in the men 's triathlon at the @entity42
his brother @entity9 finishes third with @entity133 's @entity8 taking the silver
@entity21 takes one hour 45 minutes and 23 seconds to complete course
