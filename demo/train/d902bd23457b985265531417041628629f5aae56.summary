a new @entity1 panel is reviewing the police response to 16 days of protests and disturbances after the fatal shooting of @entity6 by a @entity8 , @entity9 , police officer			1
the so - called after - action review is taking a look at how officers from the @entity8 and @entity14 police departments and the @entity15 handled everything from crowd control to arrests to interaction with the media , according to a @entity1 official			1
the 12 - person team , which includes @entity1 officials and current and former police chiefs , is part of the federal response promised by attorney general @entity27 in response to the shooting and aftermath			1
the team started its assessment last week with a visit to @entity8 , conducting interviews with police officials and people who interacted with the police during the 16 days in august			1
they 'll return several times in the coming weeks			0
@entity27 has been critical of the heavy - handed police response , which included phalanxes of armored police firing tear gas at demonstrators			1
@entity44 , who heads the @entity1 's @entity45 , or @entity46 , has led efforts to train @entity14 area police to improve how they respond to protests			1
his office is also helping manage the after - action review			0
despite police response problems already identified by @entity27 , @entity44 said the police review will be objective			2
the group doing the after - action assessment wo n't be " naive of the facts " that caused there to be a review in the first place , he said , but " the assessment will be based on facts			0
we have to start with a very objective slate			0
" the first test of the new federal @entity46 training is expected soon , when a @entity14 grand jury decides whether to indict @entity8 police officer @entity68 for shooting @entity6			2
if the grand jury decides not to indict @entity68 , it could spark new protests			0
@entity44 said tuesday that his office has done a first round of training for 27 police commanders			0
the training covers everything from arrest practices to use of force			0
one focus of the training is the guardian vs. warrior mentality			0
the aim , @entity44 said , is to move police to embrace the guardian mentality , so they act as guardians of constitutional rights , instead of warriors , as their riot - control armor may suggest			2
the @entity1 is also conducting a separate civil rights investigation of the shooting and an investigation of the practices of the @entity94			1

@entity1 has been looking at civil rights issues in the @entity8 case
now it also is examining the police response to 16 days of august protests
