concerns about even remote chances of @entity3 exposure rippled friday from a @entity5 airline to a cruise ship off @entity7 , with @entity8 contacting hundreds who flew with an infected nurse and carnival quarantining a health worker only tangentially linked to an @entity3 patient 's care			1
the airline 's move relates to @entity18 , a @entity19 nurse who treated an @entity3 patient and then was diagnosed with the virus this week after flying round trip between @entity19 and @entity23			1
a @entity25 official said thursday she could have had symptoms earlier than believed -- a period possibly covering her two flights on @entity8			2
@entity8 spokesman @entity28 said that , by early friday evening , airline officials had contacted as many as 800 passengers , including those on @entity33 's october 10 flight to @entity23 , her october 13 return flight to @entity19 and five other trips taken by the latter plane before it was taken out of service			1
the @entity25 , even as it said these passengers have an extremely low chance of getting @entity3 , is reaching out to those on @entity33 's flights			1
@entity33 is one of two nurses at @entity19 ' @entity45 who became ill with @entity3 while treating @entity46 , a @entity47 man who was the first person diagnosed with @entity3 in the @entity5 and died october 8			1
she was hospitalized tuesday , one day after her return flight from @entity50 , where she was visiting family and planning her wedding			0
@entity33 was moved wednesday to @entity54 's @entity53			2
the other nurse , @entity55 , is being treated at a @entity57 facility in @entity58			2
authorities initially said @entity33 had a slightly elevated temperature of 99.5 degrees @entity61 ) , which was below the fever threshold for @entity3 , but did n't show any @entity3 symptoms on her monday flight			1
this is significant because a person is n't contagious with @entity3 , which spreads through the transmission of bodily fluids , until he or she has symptoms of the disease			1
her uncle , @entity33 , said thursday night his niece did n't feel sick until the morning after her return to @entity19			1
and the @entity25 's dr. @entity77 said friday that @entity33 did n't have classic @entity3 symptoms like a sore throat , fever or muscle aches on her trip			1
but @entity77 said that she may have started feeling off on october 11 , and investigators could n't rule out her illness starting the previous day -- when she flew from @entity87 to @entity50			0
" she rested for a long time on some days ; she said she felt funny , " he said of @entity33 's state during her trip			2
" those types of things , but nothing specific			0
" @entity3 in @entity5 : who has it , who does n't , who might @entity7 refuses to let possible @entity3 case disembark the @entity8 passengers and crew members are n't the only ones to find themselves thrust into the @entity3 story			1
so , too , are 16 people being monitored in northeast @entity50 -- including two employees at a bridal store @entity33 visited -- because they were in the vicinity of or had contact with her , health officials there say			0
there also are 48 people who had contact with @entity46 in @entity87 before he was hospitalized			1
their 21 - day monitoring period , during which their movement has been restricted , will end sunday , at the latest			0
" monday afternoon is when we 're going to start piecing our lives together , " @entity113 said			0
@entity113 said he is the husband of @entity116 , the daughter of @entity46 's fiancee			1
@entity113 said he had n't been able to go to work the past three weeks			0
then there are the 76 health care workers involved in @entity46 's treatment , one of whom is now in the middle of the @entity124 and a diplomatic kerfuffle			1
that @entity45 worker did not have direct contact with @entity46 , but " may have had contact with his specimen , " the @entity126 said on friday			1
it has been 19 days since that may have happened -- two days shy of the maximum 21 - day @entity3 incubation period			1
carnival ceo @entity135 told @entity137 's @entity136 the woman is a lab supervisor and " has no symptoms whatsoever			2
" even so , she was isolated on the ship			0
" we have a lot of experience in the cruise industry , " said @entity135 , citing diseases such as @entity142 , @entity143 and the flu			2
" ... the @entity25 has protocols in place ; we 're following those protocols			0
" the vessel is heading back to @entity153 , @entity87 , with the passenger on board			2
but that 's not what the @entity5 government wanted			2
@entity126 spokeswoman @entity159 said the plan was for the passenger to get on land in @entity7 , then be flown back to the @entity5			1
the @entity7 government refused to let the passenger leave the ship , given the potential @entity3 exposure , despite a plea from @entity5 secretary of state @entity168 to @entity7 prime minister @entity169			1
" there 's a lot of misinformation out there and a lot of fear about this disease , much of it not rooted in actual facts , " @entity159 said , adding that @entity7 authorities " could have handled ( this situation ) differently			1
" @entity7 's government responded friday night , in a statement in which it also announced it is barring travel from @entity184 , @entity47 , @entity185 and @entity186 , by saying it " regrets ( being ) unable to move " the @entity19 hospital worker " and her traveling companion " onshore for evacuation from an international airport			1
" this decision was made out of preponderance of caution for the welfare of the citizens and residents of @entity7 , " said the government , which did n't dispute that the passenger was low risk			1
nurse : my neck was exposed all but a few of the thousands of documented @entity3 cases originated in @entity207			1
yet it 's the two cases that spread here -- @entity33 and @entity210 -- that have caused a fury in @entity87 , fueling fears and complaints about the procedures meant to keep health care workers safe			0
one of those affected is @entity45 nurse @entity218			0
she said thursday that the @entity19 hospital did n't give her proper gear while she cared for @entity210 , even though it was more than a week into the @entity3 response there			1
@entity223 told @entity137 's @entity224 that the gear she was given -- when she cared for @entity210 for one day -- included a @entity228 suit , gloves and booties that covered most of her body , but not her neck			0
" i just told them , ' why would an area so close to my mouth and my nose ... be exposed ? ' " @entity223 told @entity224			0
" and they did n't have an answer			0
" she said she asked supervisors about new gear and was told it had been ordered			0
but she said the better equipment should have been procured more quickly , and raised concerns for her colleagues who were more involved in ebola care			0
" i just know that the ( two ) nurses that have been infected , they were dealing with the same equipment while they were dealing with so much more than i dealt with personally , " she said			0
" they put their lives on the line and without the proper equipment			0
" she also said that prior to @entity46 's arrival in late september , nurses at the hospital had no mandatory @entity3 training and only an optional seminar			1
the hospital has said its professionals wore equipment consistent with @entity25 guidelines at the time			0
dr. @entity266 , the @entity25 's director , admitted at a congressional hearing wednesday that " some forms of " health care workers ' protective equipment " did allow exposure of some parts of the skin			0
" given such concerns and the fact @entity210 and @entity33 got @entity3 at work , the @entity25 " very soon " will put out updated guidelines on putting on and removing protective gowns , masks , gloves and other gear , agency spokeswoman @entity274 said friday			2
@entity168 : ' we have to do more ' in @entity207 there have been eight confirmed cases of @entity3 in the @entity5 : @entity46 , three missionaries , an @entity289 freelance cameraman and a @entity291 doctor infected in @entity207 , plus the two @entity87 nurses			1
the missionaries have all been released from hospitals , while the others are being cared for at @entity54 's @entity53 , @entity296 and the @entity57 hospital in suburban @entity298			0
@entity5 authorities ' response goes well beyond providing medical care			0
@entity304 , state and local governments , @entity302 , various health agencies and even the @entity5 military have all played a part in the response so far			0
thousands of @entity5 troops will help in @entity207 , performing duties such as flying in supplies , building field hospitals and helping local authorities with logistics			0
several @entity5 military officials told @entity137 on friday that the @entity316 is considering sending anywhere from a dozen to 100 of its health care professionals to help @entity25 officials in the region			0
the @entity324 administration also will appoint @entity325 -- former chief of staff to vice presidents @entity326 and @entity328 -- as his " ebola czar " in an effort to help streamline @entity5 's response			0
there 's also a press to recruit other countries to devote their own resources and money to help stem the months - long outbreak in @entity207 , where all but a few of the roughly 9,200 reported @entity3 cases and 4,555 deaths have occurred , according to the @entity291			1
@entity168 , the @entity5 secretary of state , expressed disappointment friday in the international response , saying " we are barely one - third of the way " to hitting the @entity345 ' $ 1 billion fundraising goal for the ebola fight			2
" we have to do more and we have to do it quickly , " @entity168 said			2
" ... if we do n't adequately address this current outbreak now , then @entity3 has the potential to become a scourge like @entity353 or polio that we will end up fighting -- all of us -- for decades			2

@entity7 : passenger with @entity3 link not let in " out of preponderance of caution "
@entity168 calls @entity7 's leader to ask if cruise passenger can disembark , is *rebuffed*
2 @entity19 nurses contracted @entity3 while caring for patient @entity46
spokesman : *frontier* done contacting up to 800 on flights linked to one nurse
