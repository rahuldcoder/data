-- some of the best food on the @entity2 and @entity4 island of @entity5 is served up by small , local vendors -- froggies on @entity8 , @entity9 , @entity10 's , @entity11 and @entity12 © are popular options			1
visitors to the @entity16 vacation island , however , tend to stay close to resorts , preferring to nurse poolside glasses of rum punch during their stays			0
not that there 's anything wrong with that -- resorts around the famed white sands of central @entity26 are terrific			0
it 's just that many visitors leave the island having missed out on a gathering of the best local tastes in town , just a short cab ride away			1
local party launched in january , the island 's thursday night @entity35 is a weekly party that aims to get tourists mingling with locals			1
it takes place in a part of @entity5 ( often called " @entity5 " ) that most tourists do n't readily frequent			1
island specialties such as jerk chicken , conch fritters , just - caught fish and an array of fresh seafood are cooked on the spot by the types of smaller vendors most tourists would n't typically come across			1
the rum punch , too , is mixed in a way locals swear ca n't be replicated by any hotel bar			2
a steel band punctuates the rhythm of a @entity60 , a @entity62 - style dance and music parade			0
@entity65 's 50 best beach bars " our goal is to get people out of their @entity26 resorts and get them to experience our local food , culture and music , " says local tourist board representative @entity66 , the brains behind the @entity35			1
reaching across the divide @entity2 and @entity4 is known for white sand beaches , turquoise waters , spectacular snorkeling and diving , and a heavy tilt toward high - end travelers			2
there 's a distinct separation here between locals and tourists , who tend to stick on or close to their resorts			2
so it 's important , @entity66 says , to try and tip the scales the other way , " since the trickle down does n't necessarily happen the way it should			0
" longtime providenciales resident @entity92 recalls a time when @entity26 was nothing more than a raw stretch of beach , when expats ( many of whom never left the island and became @entity2 and @entity4 residents ) and locals all knew each other and would often hang out together			1
" tourists are not really aware of where we have come from to get to where we are , and it has been hard , but i 'd say that what 's important here is that everyone does things together and we like to keep it that way , " says @entity92 , whose engineer husband put in the lights for the runway at @entity5 ' airport in 1983 and later wired up @entity108 , the first luxury resort on @entity5			0

another regular is the charismatic @entity136 , who goes by the nickname " @entity138 " and is the creator of potent cocktails			0
judging by the crowds lining up at stands like @entity9 , where owner @entity144 busily fries up vast quantities of fresh snapper , the word may be spreading faster than @entity66 expects			0
" we 're just using lime , some salt and a little bit of pepper , " says @entity149 ' daughter , @entity148 of her mother 's fish as it sizzles in hot oil			0
" it 's plain , way - back kind of seasoning , but i can tell you that you 're not going to find the same taste in the big hotels			0
" tourists seem to be loving the local taste			2
" it 's a fantastic party -- a great occasion for locals , expats and tourists to get together , and i 'm definitely coming again , " says @entity166 , a visitor from @entity167			2
the @entity2 and @entity173 takes place every thursday from 5:30 - 9:30 p.m. at @entity175 , @entity176 , @entity5			1
