-- a week into the @entity5 disaster , the desperate and dusty faces of both survivors and rescuers tell a plaintive story : we need more , more , more			1
the capital 's airport , the country 's roads and its ports were devastated by last week 's 7.0 - magnitude earthquake , leaving @entity5 's crumpled infrastructure the chief obstacle to fresh supplies as well as food and water			1
" the significant limiting factor in terms of our ability to move forward is a reality of the infrastructure in @entity5 , " @entity20 spokesman @entity19 told reporters tuesday			1
" but to the credit of the @entity30 military , we started the operation ( at @entity33 's airport ) with maybe 20 or so flights a day			1
they 're now up well over 100			0
" the goal , he said , is to double that number			0
opening a second runway would help , he said			1
so , too , would lighting at the airport			2
search list of missing and found " last night , we could n't see to land the plane that was supposed to land , " said @entity42 , the chief of @entity5 operations for the aid organization @entity44			1
" the night before we were supposed to receive two planes that could n't land			0
the night before it was the same			0
that 's our fourth plane that 's not able to land			2
" @entity42 told @entity0 's @entity51 tuesday that although the organization was " facing huge problems " in receiving supplies , the work went on			1
" this morning we had to buy a saw in the market , in the city ... for our surgeons to do amputations , " he said			2
" we had to buy a saw because our materials -- the medical equipment is not coming as it should arrive			1
" @entity42 said that some equipment and other materials are coming into @entity5 by road from the @entity67 , a route that @entity19 cited as one of several that are slowly being opened to channel aid			1
the airport , the ports , @entity73 ships with helicopters and a @entity76 unit are all important to getting vital supplies into the country , @entity19 said			1
high - resolution images of damage maj. gen. @entity83 , the @entity30 commander of the @entity5 task force , told reporters that @entity5 should see some " initial operating capacity " at its ports by the end of the week -- including the capability of bringing in fuel needed to take trucks into more remote areas			1
additionally , he said that officials were looking into the possibility of opening an airstrip at the city of @entity97 " to relieve some of the immediate pressure on @entity33 airfield			1
" @entity100 , spokeswoman for @entity101 , which has a long - standing program in @entity5 , said that aid is clearly increasing daily , but much more needs to be done			1
" operations here have been an incredible challenge , and @entity101 has done emergency response for years and years and is very seasoned , " she said			0
" [ but ] we have to say this is probably one of the hardest ones we 've had			0
" we are working out of an office			0
right now our office is overflowing			0
it 's a place where we all sleep , we all eat granola bars , and we all do our work there			2
" full coverage @entity119 updates a more - than - welcome sight arrives off @entity5 wednesday morning : the @entity30 @entity121 , a state - of - the - art hospital ship that saw duty during the aftermath of @entity126 in 2005 in @entity127 and the 2001 terror attacks in @entity129 , among others			1
the ship , which can house up to 1,000 patients , brings with it more than 1,000 medical and support personnel			0
but on the ground , caregivers struggle to provide the kind of care their patients need			0
dr. @entity139 of the @entity140 , a group of volunteer medical personnel , said that his group is hoping to have intensive - care units in " a handful of days			0
" " things are coming together , but it is certainly not the way it is back home , " he said			2
" right now we have seven operating rooms up and running on the campus			0
we could really use 20 probably			0
at times we run so low on medications that it gets difficult to know whether we will continue to operate			0
" dr. @entity154 from @entity155 , which also has a long - standing program in @entity5 , said the military effort to get @entity5 running again is working , but the need is simply unimaginable			1
" look , there 's hundreds of thousands of patients that are injured , " he said			2
" there 's hundreds of thousands of others that have been killed probably , that we have n't even accounted for , and there 's 150 nurses buried a few feet from here in the rubble of the nursing building			2
" and even those military personnel on the ground were spread widely			0
gen. @entity176 , force commander of the @entity178 troops who make up the @entity180 command in @entity5 , said his soldiers were there to do whatever is needed			1
" we understand that the country deserves more in terms of humanitarian aid and security , but our forces are dedicated to different fronts , including aid , security , search or bodies , recovery of missing people , " he said			2
" it 's a large amount of tasks to be done			0
