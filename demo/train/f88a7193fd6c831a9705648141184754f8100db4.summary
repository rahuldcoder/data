@entity1 , @entity0 -- protesters draped themselves in the colorful flag of @entity5 and shouted slogans at the @entity8 embassy in @entity1 on saturday at the start of a demonstration to mark the 50th anniversary since the @entity13 uprising against @entity8			1
protesters have gathered in @entity1 to mark the 50th anniversary of the @entity5 uprising			1
" @entity13 in @entity5 -- we are with you ! " they shouted			1
" @entity8 , @entity8 , @entity8 -- out , out , out ! " the small but fervent group marched from the embassy through west @entity1 to @entity19 , where they were due to hear a speech by @entity21 , a @entity8 dissident who was one of the student organizers of the @entity24 protest in @entity25 in 1989			1
" i think it 's important that @entity5 is kept in the world 's eye , " protester @entity30 told @entity2 amid placards declaring " 50 years too long " and " we are @entity13 , not @entity8			1
" while @entity5 is technically autonomous from the central @entity8 government , its current government is directed from @entity25			1
the @entity36 , traditionally the spiritual and political leader of the @entity38 , lives in exile in @entity40			1
tuesday marks the 50th anniversary of a failed 1959 uprising against @entity25 's rule that sent the @entity36 into exile			1
protest organizers said the march was meant to draw public attention to what they say is a deepening crisis a year after @entity8 cracked down on protests across @entity5			1
" ( @entity53 prime minister ) @entity52 and other world leaders must respond urgently and publicly to the @entity5 crisis by taking immediate action , " said @entity51 , director of @entity5			0
" they should demand that @entity8 calls off its security stranglehold in @entity5 as an essential first step towards backing the @entity36 's initiative in finding a long - term and negotiated settlement to @entity8 's occupation			1
" @entity38 say they resent the slow erosion of their culture amid an influx of @entity67 , the largest ethnic group in @entity8			2
that resentment spilled over last march , when @entity71 monks initiated peaceful @entity73 protests in the regional capital , @entity75 , on the 49th anniversary of the uprising			0
the protests soon turned violent , with demonstrators burning vehicles and shops			0
some protesters advocated independence from @entity8 , while others demonstrated against the growing influence of the @entity67 in the area and other regions of @entity8 with ethnic @entity13 populations			1
the subsequent crackdown left 18 civilians and one police officer dead , according to the @entity8 government			0
@entity5 's self - proclaimed government - in - exile put the death toll from the protests at 140			0
@entity8 accuses the @entity36 of fomenting the discord in his homeland -- a charge he denies			2
" @entity36 demanded the establishment of the so - called ' greater @entity13 area ' on a quarter of the @entity8 territory , to drive away @entity8 army stationed there guarding the @entity8 territory , and to drive away @entity8 people of other ethnic groups who lived there for generations			1
is such a person a religious figure ? " @entity8 foreign minister @entity111 said saturday			0
" the conflict between him and us is not religious conflict , human rights conflict , ethnic conflict , nor cultural conflict , " @entity111 said			0
" the conflict is whether or not to maintain @entity8 's unification , and whether or not to permit @entity5 to be separated from the @entity8 territory			2
" the @entity36 has said he does not advocate violence or a separate and independent @entity5			2
he has said he wants a genuine autonomy that preserves the cultural heritage of the region			0
" i 'm just disgusted with the way the @entity8 behave towards the @entity13			2
even if you accept that @entity5 has been swallowed up by @entity8 , why ca n't they give to them autonomy , respect their religion , their culture ? " protester @entity125 said saturday			2
" these are peaceable people , one of the most peaceable people in the world			0
" protester @entity135 said she hoped the protest march would make people more aware of the situation inside @entity5			0
" i feel as a human being , what ( the ) @entity8 are doing for 50 years , nobody 's bothering with it , " she said			0
" and it 's a real shame on everyone			0
