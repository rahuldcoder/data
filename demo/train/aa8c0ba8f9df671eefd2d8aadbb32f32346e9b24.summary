@entity0 -- after months of bloodshed that has left the @entity6 people on the brink of civil war , more than 1,000 activists gathered outside the @entity9 on saturday to mark the one - year anniversary of the start of the uprising in @entity6			1
the activists -- ranging in age from children to senior citizens -- waved @entity6 flags and held posters denouncing @entity6 president @entity19			1
the protesters were calling upon @entity22 president @entity21 to intervene in the conflict that has left more than 8,000 people dead , according to @entity26 estimates			1
@entity27 , chairman of the @entity28 and one of the organizers of saturday 's rally , said he 's tired of @entity21 's words and wants to see them turned into action			2
@entity27 , who has met with secretary of state @entity35 , said the @entity21 administration has n't stepped in to help @entity6 for a number of reasons , including a divided opposition			1
" that might be true , but i do n't think that that 's an excuse , you know , to let things as is in @entity6 , " said @entity27 , adding that the administration told him there is danger of a civil war if it interferes			1
" what i feel and what i tell them , in fact , if they do n't interfere , there will be civil war and there will be a big mess in @entity6 that will spread to all surrounding countries			1
" according to organizers , more than 1,200 protesters from around the @entity22 -- many of them @entity6 - @entity22 -- attended the rally , where a surprising youth presence expressed their frustration with the situation			1
wearing @entity6 headbands and face paint , they clapped and chanted in unison , " we just want to stop the killing , freedom for @entity6 , @entity70 willing ! " some of that frustration comes from a lack of @entity22 awareness , said 14 - year - old @entity74			1
" really what we have to do is , you have to inform other people because people do n't know about it , " said @entity74 , who has family living in the battered city of @entity76			2
" all they know is that , ' oh , there 's something going on in the @entity85 , ' when really it 's much more than that			0
they 're fighting for their freedom			0
it 's something we have guaranteed here in @entity22			2
we have it no matter what			0
but these people do n't have it and they 're fighting for that , and we need to respect that and help them			0
" @entity98 , 16 , agreed			0
" as a @entity100 , we need help , " @entity99 said			0
" we need help from @entity0 we need help from @entity21			0
we need help from people who can actually make a difference			0
we 're trying our hardest , but clearly it 's not helping			0
so we are asking for @entity22 's help			2
