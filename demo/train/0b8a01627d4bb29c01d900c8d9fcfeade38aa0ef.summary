-- and then there were 10			1
" i think this is probably our last reunion , " said @entity2 , 86 , of @entity3 , @entity4			1
" i wish it could continue , but we 're getting shorter in numbers			1
" at a hotel where i was staying near an @entity4 interstate highway exit , i had seen a small group of elderly men having breakfast together each morning			1
in front of the little area that had been reserved for them was a placard with a military insignia and the words : " @entity21			1
" i would see them in the elevators ; i introduced myself , and found out that this was the annual reunion of the @entity25 that , in @entity26 , had fought its way through @entity28 and @entity29			1
fifteen - thousand @entity31 soldiers in that division had crossed the ocean to @entity34 ; the men i spoke with said that some 1,100 had been killed in combat , with many thousands more injured , some grievously			1
the ones who were lucky enough to make it home after the war began having reunions in 1947			1
they were large events during the 1950s and into the 1960s ; 500 or 600 veterans of the @entity25 would convene for regional gatherings , and would bring their families			1
sometimes , the men told me , there would be thousands of people at the get - togethers			1
ten soldiers were well enough to come to the national reunion this year			2
" they would love to hold onto it , " said @entity52 , the daughter of former infantry sergeant @entity53 , whom she had accompanied to the reunion			2
" but this will almost certainly be the final time			2
with so few of the men who are still alive and able to attend , we do n't even have a large enough group to get a good rate at hotels			1
" her dad -- 86 , a retired carpenter who lives in @entity65 , @entity66 -- said he was 18 when he went into the service			2
fighting in @entity34 , he said , " you had to depend on one another for whether you lived or not			2
when you lost one , it was like losing a brother			2
" that is why the reunions have always meant so much to him : " we went through the same things , and we 're the only ones who can understand that			1
when you 're getting shelled together ... the lucky ones who made it through , it 's just so good to see each other every year			2
you 're just so glad to see them			2
" they were riflemen and artillerymen and mortarmen during the @entity34 campaign ; they slept out in the open when the temperatures were below zero and when the temperatures were 80 degrees , they sometimes had to go weeks without bathing , they dug foxholes for shelter and ate cold rations and dreamed of home			2
they encountered , and helped to liberate , @entity102 concentration camps and , the indelible horror fresh in their eyes and in their minds , they fought on			1
young men then , they often feared that they would never have the chance to see their families again			1
at the dinnertime banquets at the three - day reunion this year , even with family members and an honor guard present , there were only around 35 people in the room			2
a ventriloquist entertained the old soldiers one night ; at one meal there was a combo playing songs from the 1940s			2
in the weeks since the reunion , i have kept in touch with some of the men and have spoken with them some more			1
they told me that the motto of their division -- that " @entity21 " line -- derived from a wartime speech by @entity135 , in which he said that the @entity142 would " bleed and burn in expiation of their crimes against humanity			0
" the men know that very few people remain who recall the duty of the 63rd			1
but their pride in their combat remains fierce			0
" this division accomplished everything it was asked to do , " said @entity150 , 88 , of @entity151 , @entity4 , who was 19 when he went in			0
" @entity155 gave up an inch of ground , literally or figuratively			0
" the men said they hope that @entity31 military men and women who are serving around the world right now will someday find the same comfort and warmth when , 50 or 60 years in the future , their own surviving numbers grow small , and they are able to get together with those who fought beside them : with the people who know best what they went through , who shared such an arduous and defining part of their young lives			1
" the feeling is still there , " said dr. @entity171 , 86 , a retired family physician in @entity172 , @entity4 , who enlisted when he was 17			0
" we have something in common			0
we counted on each other then , and we still do			0
it helps to know that there is someone who will watch your back			0
" at the hotel the men sat and talked quietly			1
some walked slowly ; other guests at the hotel either waited patiently , or hurriedly walked around them , intent to get where they were going without delay			1
" my eyesight is n't too good anymore , " said @entity2			0
" but i like seeing these friends every year			0
they protected me , and i am grateful for that			0
" during the war , @entity53 said , when a member of the 63rd would die in combat , replacement troops would be brought in			0
" after a while , we learned not to get too friendly , in a way , " he said			0
" because we knew that it would be breaking up your heart again when one of them goes , too			0
" the end of the reunions is something the men say they know they will have to accept			1
" we do n't cry on each others ' shoulders about it , " @entity171 told me			0
" the feeling is that it has come to this , and there 's nothing we can do about it			0
" they understand that in the end , as at the beginning , they have each other			0
" the kinship is not something that you set out to form , " said @entity224			0
" it 's just something that happens			0
" there is a bond between infantrymen			0

the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity238 .			1

@entity238 ran into a group of older men at a hotel ; turned out to be @entity26 military men
the @entity25 , which fought in @entity28 and @entity29 , has held reunions for decades
now , with few remaining of a force once *15,000* strong , the reunions are likely finished
@entity238 : the men feel bonded , have been through much ; still have each other
