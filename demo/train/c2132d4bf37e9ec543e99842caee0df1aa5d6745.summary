-- hispanics are described as the largest minority group in the @entity3 , as a burgeoning force in the electorate and as an untapped frontier of the business market			1
yet these descriptions belie the complexity of the 44 million people to whom they refer			1
@entity12 , with daughters @entity13 ( left ) and @entity15 ( center ) , says the labels " @entity18 " and " @entity19 " are limiting			1
even the terms used to name them -- hispanics , hispanic - americans , latinos , latino - americans , the @entity27 - surnamed -- too tightly package the people categorized by those definitions , some observers say			1
" we are mixed and we are many things , " said @entity30 , a documentary filmmaker			0
many of his films , such as " @entity33 " and " @entity34 is the @entity35 : @entity38 and the @entity39 , " explore the experience and identity of @entity25 in the @entity3			1
@entity25 " very often do n't share language , do n't share class circumstances , do n't share education ; it 's very difficult to speak about them as one thing , " he said			0
from a census standpoint , being of @entity18 or @entity19 origin means a person identifies himself in one of four listed categories : @entity50 , @entity51 , @entity52 or " other @entity27 , @entity18 or @entity19 " origin			1
in the latter more open - ended category , respondents can write in specific origins , such as @entity58 , @entity59 or @entity60			2
according to a @entity64 / @entity63 survey in 2002 , that is how most @entity25 choose to identify themselves			0
when asked which terms they would use first to describe themselves , 54 percent said they primarily identify themselves in terms of their or their parents ' country of origin			2
about one quarter choose " @entity19 " or " @entity18 , " and 21 percent chose " @entity72			1
" but the broader terms -- @entity19 , @entity18 -- are the ones tossed about when the media want to discuss a " trend among @entity25 , " or when a politician appeals to the " hispanic vote			1
" the @entity3 government came up with the term " @entity18 " in the 1970s to generally refer to people who could trace their origin to @entity27 - speaking countries			1
the term " @entity19 " refers to origins from @entity86 , which includes non-spanish speaking countries like @entity88			1
the terms are often used interchangeably , which is a point of some contention in the wider community			2
but do the terms carry meaning among the people to whom they refer , or are they merely governmental designations ? " that 's the way you call our people , " @entity12 , 52 , said of the terms			2
she and her family emigrated from @entity103 nearly two decades ago , and she works as a vice president in her daughter , @entity105 's , @entity106 , @entity108 - based communications firm			0
" either you are @entity19 [ or ] @entity18			1
i 'm fine with that , but i think that we are so much more than that , " @entity12 said			0
@entity112 , 49 , a native of the @entity60 who owns an insurance agency in @entity115 , @entity116 , laughingly answered the question of how he identifies himself			0
" @entity122 or @entity123 , " he said , adding , " we 're being put together in this package and that 's too hard , " he said , stressing that he did n't like labels			0
he continued , " @entity124 really represents who i am , instead of @entity60 or @entity19			0
" he never uses @entity18 to identify himself because " i am mixed , " @entity112 said			1
" @entity18 does n't go with me because i do n't believe that @entity126 was the best thing for @entity86			1
" " for me ... there is no such thing as a @entity19 identity , " said @entity128 , professor of @entity51 and latino studies at @entity130 at the @entity131			2
" there 's certainly a cultural understanding ... [ and ] a political identity , " she said , noting that the many different groups will join on particular issues such as immigration and wages			2
but she stressed that it was not a homogenous group			0
" not all @entity25 speak @entity27 , for example			0
not all @entity25 are going to vote @entity145 ... all @entity25 are not immigrants			0
" others , such as @entity148 , a longtime veteran of hispanic marketing , said similarities among the different subsets of @entity25 do show a @entity19 identity , one partly fused through the group 's experience in the @entity3			1
@entity148 heads a @entity156 - based @entity18 advertising agency called cruz / kravetz : @entity157			1
the @entity158 embarked on a @entity19 cultural identity project last year -- when @entity148 was the organization 's chairman -- to better understand a group of consumers they felt could not be adequately reached through the traditional spanish - language market			1
there is " very definitely a @entity19 identity , " @entity148 said			2
it is drawn along parallels in values and ways of thinking and regardless of country of origin , the group tends to " cluster " in a few areas , he said			2
those areas include interpersonal relationships ( @entity25 tend to emphasize family ; individuality is not as important ) , perceptions of time and space ( they have longer time horizons and have a relaxed sense of privacy ) , and spirituality ( religion and spirituality have a strong influence on @entity19 life and perception of the world )			0
@entity193 , the founder of @entity194 , a group of advertising and media companies , also said there are definite cultural ties among @entity25 , particularly between those born in the @entity3			1
so much so , he said , that he and others coined the term " new generation @entity25 " to refer to them			0
" we 're talking about people that have grown up here in the @entity3 in @entity19 households , most likely with their parents speaking @entity27 at home , eating certain foods at home , certain values and traditions that are instilled in them , from music to religious beliefs to the importance of family , these sorts of things , " @entity193 said			1
" and it creates very much an identity that is @entity19			0
" @entity193 said this group of @entity3 - born @entity25 should be reached with culturally nuanced media , in the same way the @entity72 market functions			1
still , some chafe at the labels			0
" every time it comes up it just kind of annoys me and makes me mad , " @entity228 , of @entity229 , @entity230 , said of her background			0
her parents emigrated from @entity235 before she was born , but she said she 's never identified with the @entity50 culture			0
" on a regular basis i get asked where i 'm from , " she said			0
" and i 'll usually reply , ' my parents are from @entity235			0
' and i do n't say , ' i 'm @entity18 or @entity19 , or i 'm from @entity235 , ' because i 'm not			2
" e-mail to a friend			0

there are more than 44 million people of @entity18 origin in the @entity3
the community includes *diverse* national origins , generations , languages
some observers say enough similarities exist to project a communal identity
