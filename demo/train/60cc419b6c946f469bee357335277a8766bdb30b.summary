@entity0 -- a 30 - year ironclad rule undone by an 18 - day revolution saw its epilogue saturday -- with former @entity6 president @entity5 ordered to spend the rest of his days behind bars			1
at one time , @entity5 , 84 , dominated @entity6 's political landscape by intimidating opponents and infiltrating political movements			1
saturday , after a 10 - month trial he attended on a stretcher locked inside a courtroom cage , a judge ordered his transfer to a @entity0 maximum security prison , according to state tv			1
angry protests erupted inside and outside the court as the former president 's allies and foes voiced their reaction to the landmark verdicts			1
some slammed the judge for finding him guilty , while others called for his execution			0
while @entity5 was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the killing of pro-reform demonstrators -- a charge for which he could have faced the death penalty -- he was cleared of corruption , and his sons acquitted of the charges they faced			1
judge @entity42 was in no doubt about the significance of the moment , as he spoke of the " dark " days of @entity5 's three - decade rule			1
" we made a promise to have a fair trial based on the law of the land and we wanted this historical trial to be just and fair in order to give the rights to its true owners , no matter what the sentence will be , " he said			0
when the pro-democracy protests started in january last year , few would have dreamed this would be the punishment handed down to the man who ruled over them for so long			1
timeline of @entity5 's ascent and fall from power @entity5 came to power in 1981 , after then - president @entity67 died in a hail of gunfire at a military parade -- killed by @entity72 militants from within the army 's own ranks after he took the dramatic step of making peace with @entity77			1
he was a @entity78 - trained pilot who was chief of staff of @entity6 's air force during the 1973 @entity82 war			0
the early success of @entity6 pilots against @entity77 made him a national hero , and @entity67 made him vice president in 1975			0
upon assuming office following @entity67 's assassination , one of @entity5 's first acts was to declare a state of emergency that barred unauthorized assembly , restricted freedom of speech and allowed police to jail people indefinitely			1
it finally expired this week			0
@entity5 made extensive use of those emergency powers in his time at the helm			2
the @entity6 army put down riots by disgruntled police officers in 1986 , and @entity5 threw an estimated 30,000 people in jail when jihadists carried out a string of attacks on tourists			2
he won four terms as president in elections that were widely considered formalities			0
his fifth election , in 2005 , was @entity6 's first multi-party presidential vote , but many considered that , too , to be a sham			0
the country 's economy stagnated for the first 20 years of his rule			1
development picked up in the past decade , fueled by a move away from state control and by billions in tourist dollars , but analysts say its gains have been unevenly distributed			0
about 40 percent of @entity6 currently live in poverty			0
under @entity5 , @entity6 was a major player in @entity77 - @entity130 peace talks , and it contributed troops to the @entity133 - led coalition that drove @entity134 out of @entity135 in 1991			2
@entity137 leaders : where are they now ? it receives about $ 1.3 billion in military aid from @entity141 every year , second only to @entity77 , and has received nearly $ 30 billion in economic aid since 1975 , according to @entity144 figures			2
shortly before his fall from grace , president @entity145 said @entity5 had been " very helpful on a range of tough issues			1
" and @entity77 prime minister @entity149 last summer told the @entity137 - language news network @entity150 that he respected @entity5			2
" he held peace between @entity77 and @entity6 for over 30 years , and that 's a great achievement , and i think it should not be forgotten , " @entity149 said			1
in 2005 , when @entity6 mounted large - scale protests to demand fundamental and widespread reform , @entity5 intimidated the leaders of the officially banned but tolerated @entity155 , harassed middle - class demonstrators and managed to pick off protest leaders			2
but @entity5 was finally forced to step down february 11 after a nearly three - week uprising during which protesters demanded reform and a new government			1
the human rights group @entity162 estimated at least 840 people were killed by security forces during the revolution and more than 6,000 were injured			0
@entity6 is now ruled by a military council that has promised to hand over power after elections			0
a polarizing runoff vote for the presidency is due in mid-june , pitting a member of the @entity155 against a former @entity5 minister			2
neither had been favored by the revolutionaries responsible for toppling @entity5 -- and some fear a win for former prime minister @entity177 will mean the ousted strongman 's regime lives on in a different guise			1
during his long years at the helm , @entity5 escaped at least two assassination attempts , including a close call in 1995 when @entity72 militants opened fire on his motorcade at a pan-african conference in @entity188			1
in 2003 , the aging autocrat collapsed while delivering a televised speech to the @entity6 parliament -- returning later to blame his illness on the flu			0
he went to @entity194 in 2004 for back surgery and returned in 2010 to have his gall bladder removed			0
despite his bouts of illness , @entity5 never picked a vice president			1
he was widely considered to have anointed his son @entity200 as his successor			0
now @entity200 and his brother , @entity202 , have seen their ailing father -- who never expressed remorse while in court on his hospital gurney -- condemned to spend his last years behind prison walls			2
although he may yet appeal the verdict , @entity5 is still the first of the leaders deposed in the @entity212 to be handed a court sentence in person			2
" this verdict instructs us all that leaders are not immune from prosecution and in the very heart of the @entity137 world , in a civilian court , a leader has actually been brought to justice , " said @entity215 , a former @entity133 ambassador - at - large for war crimes			0
" that 's extremely important			0
" @entity1 's @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 and @entity231 contributed to this report .			0
