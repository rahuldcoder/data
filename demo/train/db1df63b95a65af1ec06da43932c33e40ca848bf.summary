@entity0 -- @entity2 may reactivate long - idle pipelines to get its oil to world markets if tensions over neighboring @entity10 result in the closure of the @entity12 , a government spokesman said sunday			1
the plans include shipping more oil to @entity17 's port of @entity18 and reopening pipelines that could deliver @entity2 crude to ports in @entity22 , @entity23 and @entity24 , government spokesman @entity13 said in a statement released from his office			2
@entity10 is resisting international calls to suspend its uranium enrichment work and demonstrate that its nuclear program remains solely peaceful			0
the @entity32 republic has warned that it will close the @entity12 if threatened , shutting down access to the @entity34			0
oil is the source of more than 90 % of @entity2 's budget			1
about 80 % of the 2.2 million barrels of oil @entity2 exports daily flows through the strait , along with about 20 % of world oil production			1
@entity2 's @entity43 approved several recommendations for finding alternatives to shipping oil out of the southern port of @entity48 through the @entity34 , @entity13 said			1
if the sea route were cut off , @entity2 could increase production through its pipeline from @entity52 to @entity18 and ship more oil aboard tanker trucks in the short term , he said			0
@entity57 followers protest government but in the long run , a government committee recommended reopening a pipeline into @entity22 and @entity23 that was shut down by the insurgency that followed the @entity64 invasion in 2003 and another pipeline to @entity24 's @entity67 port of @entity68 that has been idled since the @entity2 invasion of @entity70 in 1990			0
but @entity2 infrastructure deteriorated during the sanctions that followed the invasion of @entity70 , and putting those back into service could take years , @entity2 's oil ministry has said			2
the @entity68 pipeline was built during the @entity78 in the 1980s , when both countries targeted tankers coming in and out of each other 's ports			0
the committee also recommended building a new pipeline that would connect @entity2 oil fields to @entity88 's port of @entity89 , also on the @entity67 , @entity83 said .			2

oil provides more than 90 % of @entity2 's budget
