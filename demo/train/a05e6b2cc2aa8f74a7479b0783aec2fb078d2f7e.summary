-- the journey to interview internet security guru @entity2 began with a secret phrase , a mysterious driver and a circuitous route full of left turns , right turns and u-turns			1
it concluded at a safe house on a tropical island paradise , where the 67 - year - old was waiting in disguise -- as an old man with salt and pepper hair -- to tell his bizarre tale			2
" it has n't been a lot of fun			0
i miss my prior life			0
much of it has been deprivation			0
no baths , poor food , " @entity2 told @entity0 friday in his first on - camera interview since going on the run from @entity27 authorities who want to question him in the killing of his neighbor			1
three people have been detained for questioning in the killing , police have said , and investigators are pursuing multiple leads			1
three detained in killing of @entity43 pioneer 's neighbor @entity27 authorities say they only want to talk to @entity2 about the november 11 shooting death of @entity46 businessman @entity45 , who was found dead in his home near @entity48 , on the @entity50 island of @entity51			1
the case began to unfold on november 9 , when @entity2 told police someone poisoned four of his dogs			1
to put them out of their misery , he shot each in the head and buried them on his property , a former girlfriend said			0
officials say the dogs ' barking and aggressive behavior was a frequent source of friction between @entity2 and @entity45 , a 52 - year - old contractor who retired to @entity27 from @entity71 and lived next door			1
two days later someone shot @entity45 in the head in his own living room			1
a 9 mm shell was found on the second step on the first floor , and @entity45 was found dead on the second floor			1
former girlfriend says @entity2 ' frightened for his life ' during the interview , @entity2 said he did not kill @entity45 and did not pay anybody to kill the man			1
so why not surrender to police for questioning ? " i will not , " @entity2 said , adding his priority is to clear his name			1
to hear @entity2 , who is not a suspect , tell it : he 's a man on the run , afraid for his life , from authorities who he has been at odds with since refusing to pay a bribe to a politician months earlier			1
@entity2 is so fearful , he says , that he carries up to a dozen disposable cell phones at one time			1
he estimates he has gone through 200 since he fled more than three weeks ago			0
in fact , he only agreed to an interview with @entity0 after a number of conversations that involved middle men , telephone calls with ever changing numbers and , finally , a cloak and dagger meeting complete with a secret phrase and response			2
the phrase : " sorry i 'm late			0
" the response : " that 's ok , we are waiting for our co-worker			0
" @entity2 's near daily " catch me if you can " game is wearing thin with investigators , who are baffled and angered by the allegations			2
recently , he began a blog -- www.whoismcafee.com -- to chronicle his time on the run , the media 's portrayal of him and what he describes as harassment by the @entity27 government			2
the longer it all goes on , the more suspicious police become			0
@entity2 does n't know how the story will play out			2
" i do n't have a crystal ball			0
i 'm going to fight until something changes , " he said			0
" i will certainly not turn myself in , and i will certainly not quit fighting			2
i will not stop my blog			0
" for the software security pioneer , the end will come only if he 's arrested or he gets away from corrupt officials			0
" get away does n't mean leave the country			0
it means they will , no. 1 , find the murderer of mr. @entity45 and , no. 2 , the people of this country -- who are by and large terrified to speak out -- start speaking out , " he said			2
@entity2 founded his namesake computer security software in 1987 , running it initially out of his home in @entity146			1
he sold his stake in @entity148 in 1994			0
a 2009 story in the @entity150 indicated his fortune had plunged to $ 4 million from its $ 100 million peak , due largely to the real estate and stock market crashes that hit his investments			0
@entity2 moved to @entity27 in 2008			1
and in february 2010 , he started @entity156 , which claims on its website to be trying to " re-invent the way modern medicine combats and disarms pathogenic bacteria			0
" @entity0 's @entity161 reported from @entity27			1
@entity0 's @entity162 wrote the story from @entity164 .			2

@entity2 tells @entity0 he did not kill his neighbor , nor did he hire somebody to do it
