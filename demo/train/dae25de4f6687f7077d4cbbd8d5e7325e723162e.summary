-- @entity1 , the 23 - year - old " boat shop associate " from @entity3 was evicted from the @entity5 house last night			1
and even though @entity7 went easy on him during his exit interview , we did n't think he should be able to walk away without answering some questions			2
@entity0 : how 's it going , @entity1 ? @entity1 : it 's going as good as it can be			1
i mean , i got evicted , so it 's kind of a bummer			1
@entity0 : how much did you know that you were getting evicted ? you seemed when you gave your final speech to the house to know that it was kind of a fait accompli			1
@entity21 : yeah , i mean it 's a small house and word gets around quick , so i mean , i knew at the beginning of the week			1
and even though i tried to make as many deals as possible , they knew that the only way to get me out was to backdoor me so they took the opportunity			2
@entity0 : i mean , can you blame them ? @entity21 : no , i ca n't blame them			1
i mean , it 's a game , and i respect everybody 's game , and to be honest with you , if they did n't get me out then , they probably would n't have been able to get me out later			1
@entity0 : yeah , it 's true			1
i 'm sure you have n't had time to go back and watch , but it almost seemed like @entity42 and @entity43 might 've been ready to make a deal with you			2
at what point after you had that talk with them in the @entity49 room , did you know that 's not going to work ? @entity21 : ah , well , i was making deals all the way up to the last day , so i did n't know until the last day			1
but , @entity42 had enough respect for me to come up and let me know that none of the deals were gon na be made and i just had that gut feeling			2
@entity0 : were you surprised that @entity58 was one of the people to vote you out ? @entity21 : no , actually			1
i told her beforehand to vote with the house so that she could be in a better position			2
i mean , i knew i was going with or without her vote			2
it made her cry , but she 's a good girl , and i did n't want to ruin her game			1
@entity0 : no offense , but anything makes her cry			2
[ @entity71 ] that 's very true			1
she wears her heart on her sleeve			2
@entity0 : what was up with all the tears ? @entity21 : this was a very emotional cast			1
i feel like there was a lot of high emotions , and that house is a pressure cooker , so i think it just made everything a little bit worse			2
@entity0 : i think had @entity89 not used her power of veto , you both would actually still be in the house			0
i think that @entity93 would 've gone home			0
i do n't think people would 've taken it out on @entity89 for not using it			0
what 's your sense of what might have happened ? @entity21 : i do n't know			1
from what we were told , if she did n't use it , she would be going home , so we felt that it would be stupid for her not to use it			0
i mean , everybody told her that she would either have to use it or she 'd be going home because everyone would vote her out for keeping me here			0
so we did what we had to do at the time that we had to do it			0
@entity0 : did you ever think about playing her and somehow telling her that that was n't the case , so that she would keep you and she would go ? @entity21 : ah no. you know , i 'm not gon na lie , i fell hard for her , and i did n't want to ruin her game at all			1
i mean , i would 've used it on myself , so i told her to use it on herself			0
@entity0 : so like you said a couple minutes ago , the house was a real pressure cooker this season , and it 's been an incredibly controversial season			1
how much were you told after you left the house about some of the things people have been saying about the racism and the homophobia and the anti-semitism and the sexism that 's gone on among the contestants ? @entity21 : yeah , i was warned a little bit about some of the things			1
they told me that it 's been a pretty hectic time outside the house , but i have n't gotten in to too many specifics , so i could n't really tell you too much			1
but i know who i am , and i know that no matter what anybody says , it 's not going to change my feelings about myself			2
so bring it on is all i have to say			0
@entity0 : i have n't been watching the feeds			0
i 've just been watching the show , but there have been a lot of people that have been watching the feeds , and they 've been reporting things that several the contestants â € ” among you â € ” have said and there have been some homophobic and racist and sexist things that you 've said			1
do you have anything to say about that ? @entity0 : ' @entity5 ' adds disclaimer for prejudice @entity21 : yeah , i 'm not racist , sexist , or homophobic , so i mean , i guess everything can be taken out of context			1
everybody in there was friendly with everybody and we were n't scared to say it in front of each other , so i 'm sure it was just twisted and turned in a way to entertain			0
but i guess we 'll just have to wait and see			0
@entity0 : well , i do n't know how much some of these words can be twisted or misinterpreted			0
i think it 's difficult to misconstrue hate speech , but what was it like watching some of the things that @entity93 did , like flip over a bed or call @entity186 " or things like that ? @entity21 : i mean , it was crazy , do n't get me wrong			1
it was an emotional roller - coaster , and i just had to sit back and watch for most of it			0
but being there was kind of surreal regardless of what was going on			0
everything kind of seemed unreal to me , so it really has n't hit me yet to be honest with you			0
@entity0 : when we talked to @entity198 after he got voted out , he said that on some level when you 're playing a game you do n't want to rock the boat , but then you do n't want to be that person who just stands by idly while someone is making such racial slurs and just saying some really unfathomable things			0
did that factor in at all for you ? @entity21 : yeah , yeah			1
you know , i -- like you said , you do n't want to rock the boat			0
i did n't want to get on anybody 's bad side , and if it was n't effecting me or at me personally , i did n't really want to jump into it			2
there 's probably some times i should 've stepped in and said , " calm down , " but it 's a really crazy time			2
it 's really completely different than you would ever think , so i just sat back and enjoyed the show , i guess			2
@entity0 : how do you think @entity89 is going to react to a certain term you used to describe a private part of hers ? @entity21 : [ @entity71 ] i do n't know because i do n't know what you 're talking about			1
but hopefully , she reacts well			0
@entity0 : i guess you 'll see			0
so what 's next for you ? you 're moving back to the boat ? @entity21 : yeah , i 'm going back to the boat			1
got ta continue my sailing and hopefully , sail around @entity229 soon			1
@entity0 : ' @entity5 ' contestant loses job over racist comments @entity0 : yeah ? with @entity89 maybe ? @entity21 : ah			1
i do n't know ' bout all that , but we 'll see			0
@entity0 : who do you think is most likely to last longer as a relationship : you and @entity89 or @entity238 and @entity239 ? @entity21 : i think me and @entity89 will			1
@entity238 's got a man at home , so we 'll see about that			2
@entity0 : oh , really ? does @entity239 know that ? @entity21 : she 's got a boyfriend at home			1
she might not anymore , but she did			0
@entity0 : so you told @entity7 , you walked in one guy and walked out another			0
how so ? @entity21 : i walked in this cocky , arrogant man , and i walked out a little bit humbler			1
@entity0 : and yet you walked out saying , " i 'm a champion when i eat , sleep , and poop			0
i am a champion when i eat , sleep , and poop			0
@entity0 : that 's humility			2
@entity21 : [ @entity71 ] i am a champion through and through , and that 's why i could n't throw anything and i had to win ' em all			1
and even though i did n't win the game , i walked out with my head high , and i tried my best			0
well you were definitely a super-strong physical player			0
i think that they made the right move by getting rid of you now because you could 've just dominated in competitions			0
i feel the same way			0
