-- president @entity1 is back in @entity2 after a three - day trip to @entity4 and @entity5 that included fund - raising for his @entity8 colleagues and meetings with governors and legislators and mayors and citizens			1
when asked why he did n't visit the border , the president responded ( and please , fellow commentators , let 's get the quote and the context right ) : " ... there 's nothing that is taking place down there that i am not intimately aware of and briefed on			1
i 'm not interested in photo - ops ; i 'm interested in solving a problem			0
and ... the suggestions of those who work at the border , who visited the border , are incorporated in legislation [ that i 've already sent to @entity35 ] that we 're already prepared to sign the minute it hits my desk			1
" context : there 's a time and place for photo - ops , and a time and a place to get things done			0
hello , @entity35 ? this current immigration crisis is less about who these child refugees from the drug wars are , and more about who we are as a nation -- a nation of immigrants			1
as @entity54 , we are proud that we are a country that people run to , not from			1
our national symbol is not a @entity58 guard with a gun			0
it 's the @entity61 : " give me your tired , your poor , your huddled masses yearning to breathe free , the wretched refuse of your teeming shore			0
send these , the homeless , tempest - tost to me			0
" in 2008 , just before leaving office , president @entity67 signed a law that @entity35 passed almost unanimously , requiring unaccompanied border - crossing minors from countries other than @entity73 and @entity74 to have a fair hearing before an immigration judge			1
the @entity77 and immigrant rights groups have filed a class - action lawsuit , trying to force the government to supply legal counsel for undocumented minors facing deportation			0
president @entity1 , rightly , is upholding the @entity85			0
his administration announced that it would prioritize the immigration cases of recent arrivals , particularly unaccompanied minors and families			2
the government will add and reassign immigration judges to focus on recently arrived children and families , whose cases would jump ahead of all the others in line			2
in addition , in a balanced approach , president @entity1 has asked for $ 3.7 billion to deal with the immediate crisis			2
half the money will go to proper facilities for child refugees and more immigration judges			0
the other half will go to increased border security			2
@entity1 has a strong record on immigration enforcement , outdoing both @entity110 and @entity8 predecessors			0
he has deported over 1 million immigrants , focusing on those with criminal records			2
as documented by many nonpartisan sources , by 2011 @entity1 had reduced illegal immigration crossings to net zero			0
he doubled the number of border guards from what they were in 2004			2
indeed , @entity1 's @entity122 has been so aggressive in deportations , the @entity121 refused to hold detainees past their release dates , as requested , citing constitutional protections			0
but @entity35 , rather than confront the immigration problem with a legislative solution or consider @entity1 's request for emergency funds , has jumped headfirst into the photo - op rabbit hole			1
sadly , unless @entity35 acts , we will likely send most of the children back -- back to the drug - fueled gang violence from which they fled			1
in his request for emergency funds , @entity1 recognizes the dangerous , abusive conditions these children face in their @entity142 countries			1
he has designated some of the money to @entity145 , @entity146 and @entity147 , where most of the children come from , to crack down on gang violence and support tougher penalties on smugglers			2
money will also go to build better holding facilities for children			2
meanwhile , the @entity155 reports that human rights organizations filed a complaint for 100 refugee children , saying they were denied necessities , including diapers , were subjected to racial insults , and were confined in " squalid " @entity54 detention centers			1
this " do - nothing " @entity35 needs to do something			1
these are children we 're talking about			0
@entity35 opposition to immigration reform or emergency funds does n't stem from any philosophical objections or differences of principle			1
it stems from a calculated , petty , selfish rejection of anything @entity1 proposes			0
four years ago , the president remarked , " if i said the sky was blue , they 'd say no. if i said fish live in the sea , they 'd say no. " it 's only gotten worse			0
it 's time @entity35 channel the spirits of the @entity185 @entity184 and the late president @entity186 , both of whom practiced the art of bipartisanship , and to recall the saying from @entity191 , " come let us reason together			1
" it 's time @entity35 got spiritual , considering there 's " near universal " religious support across our nation for @entity198			1
conservative evangelicals , @entity201 organizations across the spectrum , @entity203 , and @entity205 organizations have formed coalitions urging @entity35 to implement comprehensive @entity198			1
@entity207 once wrote , " i swore never to be silent whenever and wherever human beings endure suffering and humiliation			0
" why is @entity35 silent ? where , my fellow citizens , are our acts of goodness and kindness ? for @entity218 's sake , these are children we 're talking about			1
join us on @entity220 / @entity219 .			0

@entity222 says to solve this border crisis , @entity35 and the administration must work together
*thousands* of children from @entity142 have *flooded* the @entity54 border seeking refuge
@entity222 : this is more about who we are as a nation -- a nation of immigrants
we are proud that we are a country that people run to , not from , she says
