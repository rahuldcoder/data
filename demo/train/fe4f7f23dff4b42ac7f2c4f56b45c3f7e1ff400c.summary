-- @entity1 , a prominent @entity2 attorney , has worked on eight national presidential campaigns , focusing on debate preparation			1
he played the role of @entity6 in practice debates with @entity8 in 1984 and with @entity9 in 1988 , and practice debated @entity11 more than 20 times during the 1992 campaign			1
he also played the role of @entity15 in 2000 and 2004 and helped prepare @entity16 for 23 primary debates for the 2008 nomination			1
@entity1 spoke with @entity20 's @entity19			1
@entity1 has been in practice debates with democrats from @entity8 to @entity11			1
@entity0 : how does tuesday night 's town hall format differ from other debates ? @entity1 : the individuals will not necessarily express the question as a journalist would			1
so , for example , one of these people will probably not ask about @entity32 section 341 , but rather will ask about their taxes and their tax burdens and what they care about with respect to taxation			0
and so you have to be very careful to be sure you understand what the individual is asking about and you have to be particularly careful to answer the question , because if you do n't , you risk alienating the questioner and the audience and the listeners			2
@entity0 : you 're in a unique position			0
you have prepped , i think , seven or eight presidential campaigns			0
you 've done debate prep , you 've stood in and played the role of @entity15 and others			2
what 's that like ? what are you trying to do to prepare the candidate , any candidate ? @entity1 : if i 'm playing the surrogate , if you will , if i 'm the @entity55 for a @entity56 , i try to prepare myself -- not to imitate ; i 'm not @entity58 or @entity59			1
i 'm not that talented			0
but i try to be ready with what my candidate that i 'm playing , if you will , has said -- the exact words used , the way they counterattack , the way they attack			0
and i try to make sure that the candidate i 'm working with , meaning the @entity56 , has heard just about everything that they could hear from their opponent before they ever walk on the stage			0
@entity0 : do you try to bait them , get them to bite a little and then say that 's not what you should be doing ? @entity1 : well , it can get pretty contested			1
when i prepared with rep. @entity8 in 1984 when she was running against then - vice president @entity6 , i baited her a lot and she got so angry with me that she frequently walked over to me and slugged me on the arm			0
so i left the process black and blue			0
@entity0 : when you 're doing that sort of thing , how direct can you be with the candidate ? or do you have to treat them with a bit of kid gloves ? @entity1 : i treat them with no kid gloves			2
it 's fair to say i 'm direct , i make sure they hear everything from me before they hear it on the stage and maybe hear it even a little more aggressively so they can be prepared .			2

@entity1 : candidates must make sure they answer town hall questions
@entity1 has played *republicans* in practice debates for more than 20 years
@entity1 : i try to prepare candidates for the attacks they will face
@entity1 says he *'ll* make the case aggressively to prepare candidates
