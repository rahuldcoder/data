-- " you are making our work here very difficult "			0
it is a side remark , uttered politely and quietly			0
near the start of the " @entity9 " video , a man says this			1
if you have seen the video -- and chances are you have -- you might have missed this small interaction just four minutes into the film			1
the man who is worried about having his work made more difficult tries to interrupt the filmmaker who is interviewing a child in the northern @entity21 city of @entity22			1
i do n't know who that man was or what he was trying to do			0
the footage is so old it will be hard to establish			0
but his words turned out to be prophetic : " you are making our work here very difficult			0
" @entity33 , the most prominent face of the group @entity35 , has made the work of bringing about change very difficult indeed			0
invisible children 's campaign is a well - packaged call to leave the state of affairs untouched ; their message seems so modern because their tools are			1
the point made is conformist : fight violence with violence , dismiss intricate steps of social change and make a narrow ideology mass - compatible by having millions of unquestioning people raise their fists in support			1
for the @entity55 , @entity56 and other generally comfortable corners of the world , this is a worrying picture of a mass culture that easily falls for propaganda			0
for the world 's less cozy places , to which the areas in which the @entity61 has been active belongs , mass support for maintaining the status quo is a tragedy			1
so what is the status quo ? well , it is indeed complicated			1
but suffice to say that for decades , this has been an intricate mix of violence that causes more violence , a violent government that garners international support by vilifying one side of the conflict , and international attention often reduced to uninformed celebrities expressing shock and horror			0
crucially , it has been part of @entity21 government propaganda to make this war seem like the tour of personal madness of one man : @entity90			1
this is the status quo that needs to be challenged			1
what is the @entity35 campaign doing ? advocating fighting violence with more violence ? garnering international support for a violent government ? having uninformed celebrities express shock and horror ? focusing this conflict on one person only ? having millions of people punch the air in cries for war and @entity55 troops ? and to what end ? the campaign advocates a narrow worldview			1
it is also a costly one			0
from 2006 to 2008 , the situation regarding the conflict between the @entity61 and the government of @entity21 looked promising			1
the @entity61 left @entity21 because they had signed up for peace talks -- slow , unpredictable and often irritating peace talks that did not come with a success guarantee			1
but the peace talks made the situation almost instantly better			2
two years of talking cost less than $ 15 million			2
there was no video with a mass appeal to the world to support the peace process			1
there was no call to the @entity55 government to stop working with the @entity21 army , one of the perpetrators of violence in this war			1
the @entity35 -- who visited the peace talks at various points -- decided not to take this slow and long - winded attempt at peace seriously			1
invisible children believe in war			2
they manage to make millions of people believe war is the best way to bring peace			1
peace talks turned into war in late 2008 : @entity90 was reluctant to sign the agreement as it stood at the time			2
invisible children supported @entity55 involvement ; the @entity55 supported the @entity21 army in upping the military pressure			2
@entity156 change through peaceful means was given a deadline when the @entity21 army used @entity55 planning help to bomb the @entity61 camp			2
@entity161 , the status quo , was back on			1
in the first few days of the ill - conceived military operation , a fighter plane worth millions of dollars was lost and thousands of people displaced or killed			1
war is a lot more expensive than peace			2
war as advocated through this campaign has few subtleties			0
video propaganda coupled with action kits and precise orders for what to do next leaves little room for thinking			0
a focus on one man who simply does not hold the reins in this conflict in the way that invisible children portray is myopic			0
it needs room for negotiation , compromises , and shifting the debate			0
it also needs really boring things : tedious days of discussion and engagement , mind - numbingly unsexy drafting of agreements , and an open mind at all stages			0
and it needs very invisible people committed to working away on these things through small , but important contributions			0
these are not people who buy action kits and re-tweet			0
these are people who have just been told by the @entity35 campaign that hanging a poster and wearing a bracelet is a better way to bring about social change , that the difficult political context in which they operate everyday , often at great personal risk and expense , can easily be solved if one man is removed			2
" you are making our work here very difficult " , says the man in the beginning of " @entity9			2
" how right he was			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity223 .			0

@entity225 : " @entity9 " is well - packaged call to maintain status quo
viral video about @entity21 *warlord* has more than *60* million @entity232 views this week
film " makes millions of people believe war is the best way to bring peace "
