@entity0 , @entity1 -- the cholera epidemic already blamed for more than 1,100 deaths in @entity7 could worsen because of poor sanitation in the earthquake - ravaged country , @entity4 medical researchers reported thursday			1
a lack of treated drinking water , coupled with poor hand hygiene and food - preparation practices , make the 1.3 million people still living in camps particularly vulnerable , according to a new study published by the @entity4 @entity18			1
" the course of the cholera outbreak in @entity7 is difficult to predict , " the report states			1
" the @entity7 population has no pre-existing immunity to cholera , and environmental conditions in @entity7 are favorable for its continued spread			1
" @entity27 , a @entity18 epidemiologist in @entity7 , said @entity7 authorities and aid agencies are working to limit the epidemic by emphasizing clean water and sanitation			1
but he added , " we expect we will be working very hard for many months to come			0
" @entity7 has not reported a cholera outbreak in more than a century			1
the current epidemic was first reported in october and has now spread to eight of the @entity39 nation 's 10 provinces , the @entity18 found			1
reports linking the outbreak to @entity43 troops from the @entity46 peacekeeping mission @entity44 sparked riots in the northern port city of @entity49 on tuesday			0
a new round of violent protests erupted thursday in the capital @entity54 , eyewitnesses told @entity2			0
@entity46 officials have denied the @entity43 were to blame for the outbreak			0
the @entity18 has said the strain of the cholera bacteria responsible is " indistinguishable " from one found in other parts of the world , including south @entity62 , but researchers are unlikely to be able to pinpoint how it arrived in @entity7			2
" the reality is that we have a serious problem here , " @entity18 spokeswoman @entity63 said			0
the emphasis is on controlling the outbreak , " so that more people do not become ill and potentially die from cholera			2
" the epidemic comes as @entity7 -- already the poorest country in the @entity73 -- struggles to recover from the january earthquake that killed more than 200,000 people			1
even before the quake , only 12 percent of the @entity7 population of 9.8 million received treated tap water and only 17 percent had access to adequate sanitation , the @entity18 noted			2
" the water safety and sanitation systems in @entity7 were weak be before the earthquake and made weaker by the earthquake , so conditions are ripe for the further spread of cholera , " @entity27 told @entity2			1
some symptoms of cholera , an acute , bacterial illness caused by drinking tainted water , can be mild or even nonexistent			0
but the disease can cause profuse watery diarrhea and vomiting , leading to death by rapid dehydration			0
the heart of the outbreak is the @entity7 province of @entity98 , north of @entity54			2
interviews with victims hospitalized in the first days of the outbreak found that two - thirds of them had been drinking untreated water from rivers or canals , the same percentage did not routinely use chlorine to sanitize drinking water and nearly four out of five defecated in the open			2
and as the current outbreak spreads , infected people could spread the disease further by preparing food without proper hygiene , the @entity18 reported			0
" the way to prevent acquiring cholera when sanitation is poor is to take your water from a clean water source or treat water yourself in the home , and use good sanitary practices with clean water when preparing and cooking food , " @entity27 said			0
@entity2 's @entity125 and @entity126 contributed to this report .			0
