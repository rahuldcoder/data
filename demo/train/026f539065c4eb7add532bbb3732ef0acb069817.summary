like a groggy traveler after a long , cold night , the @entity3 's comet - chasing @entity1 spacecraft woke up , warmed up and called home monday before setting off on the final leg of its journey			1
@entity1 shook off 31 months of sleep , during which it traveled into the dark reaches of the solar system , and contacted its operators monday evening			2
cheers erupted in the @entity3 mission control center in @entity17 , @entity18 , when a signal from @entity1 arrived shortly after 7 p.m. ( 1 p.m. et )			1
" the spacecraft is there , it 's awake , and i think we are all overwhelmed , " mission manager @entity20 told reporters			2
now , he said , controllers will have " two busy years ahead of them " as it approaches its target , @entity28 , and follows it around the sun. there was only an hour window for the signal to reach @entity34 , putting scientists on pins and needles			1
" the spacecraft decided to make us suffer after two and half year , " @entity38 , head of @entity39 told @entity40			0
" we came almost to the end of the window , we were very tense , " he said			0
the unmanned probe was launched in 2004 and is now nearly 500 million miles ( 800 million kilometers ) from the @entity46 -- a distance that puts it just past the orbit of @entity49			1
at that distance , the message it beamed back took 45 minutes to arrive			0
when the signal finally arrived there were cheers of relief			0
wake up @entity1 : you have a date with a comet if all goes well , @entity1 will rendezvous with the comet in august and fly with it for two years			1
scientists now have to learn how to maneuver the craft around a comet			1
" it 's flying in a very unusual environment for space flight with gas and dust and not much gravity to keep your obit stable , " @entity38 said			2
@entity1 is also supposed to send a small lander to the surface of the comet in november			2
the mission will give scientists unprecedented insight into the makeup and structure of these ancient residents of the solar system , @entity3 officials say			0
" this is groundbreaking science , " @entity1 project scientist @entity81 told @entity3 television			1
" we 're looking at where we came from , the evolution of our own solar system			0
and comets are looked upon as kind of a time capsule back to the beginning of the solar system			0
" scientists believe comets , composed of rock and ice , may have brought water and maybe even the primitive building blocks of life to @entity34			0
@entity1 carries 11 scientific instruments ; its lander has 10 more			0
@entity3 controllers ordered @entity1 to shut down most of its systems in june 2011 to save on power as it sailed through the darkest reaches of the solar system			1
the amount of sunlight reaching the solar - powered probe is only 4 % that on @entity34 , according to @entity3			1
