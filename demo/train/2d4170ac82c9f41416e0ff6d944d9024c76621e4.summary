@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 were enthralled by fake reports of an alien invasion in the @entity9 " @entity8 " radio broadcast on @entity7 in 1938			0
hundreds of science fiction movies from the 1902 silent epic " @entity12 " ( featured in the current film " @entity14 " ) to " @entity18 " to this year 's " @entity19 " have fed a deep curiosity about intelligent beings elsewhere in the universe			0
hang on to your hats , because reality is starting to catch up			0
on tuesday , scientists reported evidence from the @entity27 satellite that two @entity29 - sized planets are orbiting a nearby star about 1,000 light years from earth -- practically our back yard compared to the extent of our @entity35 , but far too distant to visit with current spacecraft			1
these planets , named @entity27 20 - e and kepler 20 - f , have sizes and masses similar to the @entity29 , and their host star is similar to our sun. but the resemblance ends there			1
both orbit very rapidly -- in 6.1 days and 19.6 days , respectively , compared to 365 days for an @entity29 year -- so both are much closer to their star than the @entity29 is to the sun. this makes both planets way too hot to support life as we know it			1
still , the pace of planet discovery is astonishing			2
sometime in the next few years , scientists will likely discover @entity29 - like planets that are capable of supporting life			1
our sun is just one star among the hundreds of billions that make up the @entity63 galaxy , which itself is only one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe			1
over the last 15 years , astronomers have found hundreds of planets orbiting stars in our corner of the @entity63 and the list will pass 1,000 next year			1
discoveries of planets are limited only by the capabilities of current telescopes and instruments and by the time needed to sample several full orbits of a planet around its host star			1
most " extra-solar planets " ( or " exoplanets " ) have been found by measuring tiny doppler shifts ( wavelength shifts ) in the light of the host star			1
with this method it is easier to find heavy planets than light ones , and easier to find planets in close rather than distant orbits			2
so most of the planets found so far are big ones , similar to @entity99 or @entity100 in our solar system , only orbiting much , much closer than the @entity29 to their host star			1
this is kind of like surveying your neighborhood for sumo wrestlers : you find far fewer than the number of other people who live there , and way fewer than the population of the world			0
so the 716 known exoplanets are just the tip of the iceberg			0
the @entity27 satellite uses a different method , based on transits of planets across the face of their host star			2
visible light from the star dims very slightly , typically by 0.01 % or less for an @entity29 - sized planet passing in front			1
thus @entity27 finds planets regardless of mass , although it more easily sees large planets ( which cover more of the star 's surface and thus diminish the light more ) and it only sees planets that cross the star as seen from the @entity29 ( which most planets do n't )			1
by the way , you can help make these discoveries			0
at @entity140 , a citizen science project started by colleagues of mine at @entity143 , anyone can search the @entity27 data for signs of new planets			0
in particular , users might find unusual systems that the @entity27 computer algorithms do n't search for			0
( for a fun @entity151 holiday interpretation of the @entity27 plots of star brightness over time , see this video			0
) " life " can mean anything from single - celled organisms to a walking , talking homo sapiens , or possibly something much stranger			2
for now , scientists are focusing on conventional carbon - based life because its signatures are well known			2
such life requires liquid water , meaning a temperature between freezing ( 32 f ) and boiling ( @entity169 )			0
planets too close to their star will be too hot , like the sweltering surface of @entity173 , which approaches the 800 degree fahrenheit temperature of kepler 20 - f. planets too far away have frigid surfaces , like @entity177 , a moon of @entity99			1
temperatures that allow water to be liquid define the so - called " habitable zone " -- like @entity185 ' favorite porridge , planets in the habitable zone are not too hot , not too cold , but just right for life			1
we have n't yet found definitive signs of life elsewhere in the universe			0
but we can estimate that even the narrowest case of carbon - based life on an @entity29 - like planet orbiting a sun - like star in the habitable zone is likely , because planets are probably common around such stars , sun - like stars are common in our galaxy , and our galaxy is similar to many throughout the universe			1
we also know the building blocks of life -- amino acids and other organic compounds -- form naturally from carbon , water and energy , as the chemists @entity210 and @entity211 first showed more than 50 years ago			0
sadly , although life is likely to exist on exoplanets throughout our @entity63 galaxy , intelligent life is another thing altogether			1
humans have lived at most a few hundred thousand years out of the @entity29 's 4.6 billion year history -- or less than 0.006 % of the available time			2
in contrast , simple single - celled organisms probably formed several billion years ago , and thus have populated the @entity29 for more than three - quarters of its existence			2
this means it is overwhelmingly likely that the life we find elsewhere will be extremely primitive			0
face it : we 're not going to be im'ing with aliens , nor should we expect an invasion or a rendezvous in outer space			0
for now , we 're just looking for cells breathing and multiplying			0
not " @entity235 " -- more like " @entity236 " ( or , " @entity237 " )			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			2

scientists *announce* the discovery of two @entity29 - sized planets
@entity240 says they 're too close to their star to host life as we know it
she says planets like @entity29 likely will be discovered in the " habitable " zone
@entity240 : life is likely to exist on some planets in @entity63 galaxy
