-- one minute and eight seconds			2
that 's how long it was from the moment @entity4 walked into the copy room to when @entity6 dropped his pants			2
in between , the two chatted about illegal stock trading and working long hours , but fans of the hit @entity12 legal drama " how to @entity14 " were not really tweeting about that			1
anytime - anywhere sex scenes are part of the show 's dna , so the over-the - top scenario in the copy room was par for the course			1
particularly for young @entity4 , a handsome law student , who in a later episode scored in a courthouse restroom with a guy he had forgotten he had sex with months earlier			1
as you can imagine , @entity4 flashes a great smile and a lot of flesh			2
he does not , however , ever flash a condom			0
and here , ladies and gentlemen , is where the conversation gets a bit uncomfortable			0
for as much as the network show is somewhat revolutionary for its willingness to showcase same - sex lovemaking , there is a question of how responsible that portrayal is			1
this week , we observed @entity42 , and we are reminded that in 2014 the virus may be manageable , but it is n't cured			1
there are 35 million living with @entity46 the world over , and 19 million do n't know it			1
and in the @entity52 , men who have sex with men make up 63 % of all new infections , according to the @entity54			1
it is n't realistic to expect a character on tv to double as a public service announcement			1
but since only 32 of the 813 prime - time scripted series regulars are @entity61 -- and not many of those 32 are seen having sex ( especially like @entity4 ) -- it seems reasonable to have high expectations for their behavior			2
" there has been a conversation about it , " @entity66 , the 25 - year - old @entity67 native who plays @entity4 , told me			0
" i 'm not privy to all of the discussion that happens in the writers ' room , but i do know early on the topic of safer sex has been brought up			2
" the interesting thing is when @entity4 is engaging in sex there actually has been condoms in the scene , they just have never made the final shot			1
when @entity4 was with @entity85 , there were condoms on the table by the bed ; when he had sex with @entity6 , there was a condom on the set then			1
" if a gay character is having safer sex and no one sees it , is he really having it ? " you never see @entity96 pull out a condom , " @entity66 said			1
" maybe society has progressed to the point where we can treat heterosexual scenes and homosexual scenes the same			0
or maybe there is something socially that makes us all uncomfortable about seeing a couple on tv pause to use protection no matter who that couple is			2
" @entity66 's character has become a bit of a lightning rod for a litany of sex and society stories in the media , from the @entity117 to @entity118			1
on sunday , @entity66 is attending a fund - raiser for the @entity120 , his first appearance at a lesbian , gay , bisexual and transgender event since the show 's debut			2
the @entity120 is a nonprofit organization addressing suicide prevention -- not @entity128 -- but he expects as the chatter about his character grows , so will his involvement with other groups			1
especially since his brother is an immunologist			0
" i 'm aware of the conversations that are happening today about drugs that can prevent you from contracting @entity46 , " @entity66 said			0
" it 's a really important one to have , and not a lot of people know about them			0
" he is referring to pre-exposure prophylaxis , or @entity141 for short			0
essentially it is treatment as prevention			0
and while there are some , such as @entity128 activist @entity147 , who question the logic of taking medicine before you are sick , that is in fact something we already do			1
for example , we are encouraged to take antimalarial drugs before traveling to countries where the virus is prevalent			0
studies have found the antiretrovirals used to treat patients who are @entity46 positive reduce the chances of @entity46 - negative people contracting the virus by 96 %			0
the findings are so promising that the @entity165 has included @entity141 in its strategy to reduce the overall number of new hiv infections by 25 % in 2015			0
all great news -- the problem is getting the word out , and that 's where a popular tv character such as @entity4 comes in			1
" this is a conversation elites , white gay bloggers , policy people and researchers are having , " @entity175 , an associate professor at the @entity176 and director of the @entity178 , told me			2
" this conversation is not happening in the community that needs to hear it most -- young gay and bisexual men of color			2
" last summer i attended the first @entity165 symposium on hiv / aids specifically targeting the lgbt community and was shocked to learn that black gay and bisexual youth -- men having sex with men , or @entity199 -- between the ages of 13 and 24 account for 55 % of new @entity199 infections in that age group			1
@entity204 , ceo of the @entity205 , told me that while it is true young men of color are more likely to contract the virus than other groups , it is important that activists and media alike push the information out to everyone to end @entity128			1
" culture influences behavior , " @entity204 said			0
" it influences behavior people find acceptable and behavior that is unacceptable			0
and when you look at the arc of lgbt rights , without question the fair , accurate and inclusiveness in media has been nothing short of transformative in the experience we have in our everyday lives			0
" so yeah , it would be amazing to have @entity4 talk about @entity141 because it would help get the message out			1
we do n't want to tell people what to do or how to live their lives			2
but we want them to be informed			0
" it 's a sentiment echoed by @entity238 , chief of staff at the @entity239			0
" we have not been parental in this , " he said			0
" we tell people this is one of the tools that 's helpful in stopping the transmission of @entity46 and let them make up their own minds			0
there are naysayers out there			0
there are people who say @entity141 encourages people to be promiscuous , but that has n't been our experience			2
people still drink and drive			0
having a tv character talk about safe sex is not the silver bullet that will kill @entity128			1
but it is another mode of disseminating critical information in the fight , much in the way vice president @entity261 cited " @entity266 " as a show that helped change the country 's attitude toward same - sex marriage			1
so yeah , it 's great that @entity4 and the other 31 @entity61 characters can have sex like everyone else on tv			1
but now that we 're watching , what will they show us ?			0

gay characters on " how to @entity14 " do n't appear to use condoms
with @entity128 still present , should tv send better message ? @entity281 asks
actor @entity283 says that the same standard is n't there for heterosexuals
@entity281 : having a gay tv character talk about safe sex could help change attitudes
