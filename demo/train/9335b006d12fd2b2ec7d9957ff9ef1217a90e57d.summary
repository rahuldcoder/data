-- it depends on mind - bending physics and ultra-cold temperatures but quantum computing could bring about a new era in processing power that promises to revolutionize everything from artificial intelligence to high finance			1
the field of quantum computing is still in its infancy but it was given a sizable boost when @entity15 announced in september that it is partnering with experts from the @entity17 @entity18 to develop quantum computing technology as part of its @entity22 team			1
the project also sees @entity15 pairing up with @entity25 and the @entity26 to create technology that could become the world 's fastest supercomputer			2
how it works in a traditional computer , circuits are either on or off , and use binary code of ones and zeros for solving problems			2
a quantum computer uses quantum bits -- called qubits -- and has circuits which exist in all possible states at the same time -- a one , a zero and everything in between			1
this ability to exist in various states greatly increases the processing power of quantum machines			0
while the science behind quantum computing seems very technical , broken down in the simplest terms it amounts to a computer which could operate at breakneck speed in comparison to a traditional computer that uses a binary system , and would be especially useful for solving what are known as " optimization problems " -- finding the best solution among huge numbers of possible options			1
currently , the world 's fastest computer belongs to @entity63 , the @entity65 supercomputer , which can carry out about 34 quadrillion calculations per second			0
experts say a quantum computer would ultimately far surpass this speed			1
@entity15 's @entity22 team has been working with scientists from @entity73 company @entity72 , which owns what has been called the first commercially viable quantum computer			1
some experts have cast doubt on whether @entity72 's computers are any faster than regular machines , but while @entity72 's ceo @entity81 concedes that it 's early days for this technology , he sees a bright future			0
" we 're at that stage of the very first days of microprocessors , when @entity86 and @entity87 built the first software for those , " said @entity81			0
a mature technology could have huge benefits in a variety of fields			0
the increased computing power could one day help run complex simulations , such as modeling climate change and helping to develop new drugs			2
" it 's not going to replace classical computing , but certain problem types fit quantum computing very well , " said @entity81			1
financial revolution ? financial services will be the first industry to feel the benefits , said @entity81			1
for example , there 's currently a huge workload on @entity109 trying to optimize portfolios and dealing with risk management			0
" ultimately , quantum computing will do that better , " said @entity81 , who served as chief technology officer for @entity114 from 1989 - 2000			1
other areas of finance which could benefit include structured asset - backed security pricing , mapping market correlations , capital project budgeting , and developing trading strategies , said @entity72			0
@entity72 said it is also interested in expanding the cloud capabilities of quantum computing			1
potential customers could include anyone with a complicated optimization problem to solve -- from sectors ranging from transportation and logistics to financial services and healthcare			1
another broad area for quantum computing is machine learning			1
using artificial intelligence to train algorithms , trying to mine big data , and also helping with fraud detection all fall under the quantum computer 's domain			2
currently , @entity141 uses @entity72 's machine to help verify flight control systems			0
another partner of @entity72 is a company called @entity146 , which is building financial algorithms with quantum computing and " making good progress , " said @entity81			1
obstacles in the way one of the biggest challenges so far for the mighty quantum machine has been environmental interference			2
the machine can only operate at an incredibly low temperature -- just above absolute zero , or -273.15 degrees			0
" this chip has to have exactly the right temperature , it has to be shielded , " said @entity81			0
" so a big part of it is building that rarefied environment			0
a huge amount of research and billions of dollars are being poured into building it			0
" maintaining the perfect environment is just one of the problems facing quantum computing			1
" we 're really just beginning to understand how we might make a full - scale quantum machine , " cautions dr @entity171 , of the department of computer science at @entity174			2
" there is a vast number of challenges remaining			0
" @entity171 believes it could be many years before we see quantum computing come into its own			2
" compared to the speed we moved from valves to transistors to integrated silicon chips , progress on quantum computers has been very slow , " wrote @entity171 , in an email			0
" it 's a much harder problem using mind - bending physics that we do n't fully understand			0
so it may take a few billions of dollars from @entity15 and a few decades before we really see quantum computers			2
" but @entity15 's confidence in creating super-fast quantum computing is palpable			1
@entity81 sees the challenge as a positive for not just @entity15 , but for all of us			0
" it ( quantum computing ) will be another tool to help solve very challenging , very hard problems , " he said .			1

@entity15 has *assembled* a team of experts trying to craft a quantum computer
financial services , machine learning and other industries could benefit
quantum computing especially useful for complex " optimization " problems
