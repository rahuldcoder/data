-- i hate public speaking			1
or to be more precise , i do n't like speaking to an audience sitting in front of me that i can see in real life			1
i do n't mind once i am going , but waiting in the wings to go on is dreadful			2
for someone who has spent the best part of three decades broadcasting in some shape or form , you might have thought this would be something of a handicap			1
my career involves speaking to large numbers of people , but here is the point : on television and radio , i ca n't see you			1
part two : quest : ' on the edge of the precipice , and about to fall ' if you do n't like what i am saying , well , i am sorry but at least i do n't have to witness the grimace , the yawn or the shake of the head before you switch off			1
it sounds so obvious but it makes a huge difference			2
more quest : scandal hit @entity36 's struggle with public life so when i saw the poster on the @entity40 tube advertising the @entity41 ( @entity41 ) course on public speaking for business leaders i thought to myself : " this is for me			1
" i did wonder what they would be able to teach me			2
after all , i have been doing this sort of stuff for quite some time			2
i was quite skeptical that they had any tricks which this old dog could use			1
what i was not prepared for was the wholesale rethinking of how i go about my breathing , thinking , and ultimately delivery			0
it can be described in one phrase : " diaphragmatic breathing ! " most broadcasters speak and breathe from the throat			0
we have a microphone to help us			0
so we never learn the art of the actor or opera singer which is to : project to the @entity67 in the @entity68			1
more quest : what makes the world 's best airline in the world of seemingly unlimited broadcasting it puts our throats under terrible strain because we do n't do it properly			1
ask any of my colleagues doing hour after hour of breaking news			0
eventually our voices become hoarse and give out			0
@entity41 was going to put that right			1
i started off with a whole load of exercises , the purpose of which seemed obscure			0
wiggling hips , shrugging the shoulders , stretching the neck , running my tongue around my teeth and then saying the months of the year with a cork in my mouth			0
apparently it 's all designed to open up the throat and allow the sound to flow from the vocal chords			2
from deep down below , right to the bottom of the belly , to allow the air to carry the sound out of my mouth			0
according to those who listened , my voice sounded richer and more rounded , less raspy and desperate			2
i did n't gasp for air			0
part three : greatest fear -- the job comes to the classroom then we moved onto presentation style and content			1
i have been told i sound like gargling with broken glass , although i ca n't hear that			2
i know i am loud when i speak -- probably 8 on a scale of ten			2
tactfully i was told i was too " full on , " and that " less is more			1
" i needed to be more aware in my style , less thrusting into the audience 's face			1
and suddenly i felt truly out of my comfort zone			0
this was feeding my insecurities			0
i had tried it out a few times while presenting @entity127 and the results were uncomfortably bad			0
i was so busy trying to remember what i was supposed to be doing , i would forget what i was supposed to be saying and what came next			0
of course , i was trying to run before i could walk			0
@entity132 , my @entity41 guide , gently reminded me that it takes time to get this right and that i should not expect changes so quickly			1
so , what did i learn from my @entity41 course ? fifteen minutes of movement and breathing before i do a presentation works wonders			1
it both relaxes those parts of the body that are about to be used and prepares them for the onslaught ahead			0
and when it works it is wonderful			0
psychologically i am much more relaxed before i speak because i feel i am ready			0
i will never really like standing in front of a large audience , hoping they will like me ( a therapist would have a field day with that comment ) but at least i am no longer nervous to the point of going to the bathroom multiple times just to get away			0
@entity41 -- my throat thanks you for giving it the rest it deserves			1
are you afraid of public speaking ? or was it something you overcame ? share your experiences with @entity0 in the comments below the story .			1

@entity0 's @entity169 hates public speaking , despite three decades in broadcasting
he *decided* to face his fear through a @entity41 course on public speaking
after so many years broadcasting @entity169 was skeptical he could learn much
quest was tactfully told he was too " full on " and " less is more " -- and he listened
