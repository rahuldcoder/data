@entity1 , @entity0 -- a man who killed five people and himself in a gun and grenade attack in @entity0 feared going back to prison and losing the life he had built , his lawyer said thursday			1
the attack on a crowded market square in liege tuesday by @entity13 , which also left at least 130 people wounded , shocked the nation			1
his defense lawyer in @entity18 , @entity20 - @entity19 , told @entity21 had called him late monday and early tuesday after the police called him in for interview tuesday afternoon over a sexual assault case			1
" it was n't so much life in prison that bothered him -- he 'd served time already -- but it was he 'd rebuilt his life on the outside , and he was worried about losing all this , " @entity19 said			1
the lawyer said he was stunned when he heard later that day that @entity13 , whom he had known for two - and - a - half years , was responsible for the grenade attack			1
" it 's very shocking			0
i do n't understand the reason why he did this , and i think i will probably never understand , " he said			0
nonetheless , @entity19 's comments give the first real insight into what might have motivated @entity13 to go on a rampage that targeted people waiting at a bus stop by a busy @entity48 market			1
after the attack , police also found a dead woman in a residence next to a workshop where @entity13 once grew marijuana , a local police spokesman said wednesday			1
@entity13 had previously served time in prison for rape and drug trafficking offenses , his lawyer said			1
he was released last year			0
@entity19 said @entity13 was also convicted on weapons charges in 2008 but later acquitted			2
liege authorities have not said he was cleared on those counts			0
liege prosecutor @entity64 told @entity2 wednesday that the police interview involved a sexual assault case , rather than a rumored rape allegation			1
" because @entity13 was convicted of rape in 2003 , police obviously regarded him as a person of interest , " @entity19 said			1
@entity19 said his client , who had a @entity0 partner whom @entity19 had met several times , feared losing everything			1
" he was someone that was integrated into society			0
i 'm not sure if he was a practicing @entity80 but he knew about his culture and his roots , " @entity19 said			0
" when things were going well for him he was very pleasant and good - natured			0
i never had problems with him			0
but , that said , sometimes when legal proceedings were dragging on , or he was accused of things he claimed ( he ) was not responsible for he could become annoyed and agitated -- but it was in words only			0
" @entity19 said @entity13 did not to his knowledge take drugs and had not been charged with drugs use			2
authorities will conduct an autopsy in part to see whether @entity13 was under the influence of drugs during the attack , said a senior @entity0 security source who has been briefed on the investigation but did not want to be named because he was not authorized to speak to the media			2
it is not yet clear how @entity13 , who @entity64 said was a @entity1 - born @entity0 citizen of @entity104 descent , obtained the pistol , semi-automatic rifle and three grenades he used in the attack			2
@entity109 , a spokeswoman for the provincial governor 's office , described amrani wednesday as having significant gunsmith and firearms skills			0
for a period up to 2008 , he held a @entity117 hunting license under which he bought at least one weapon , she said , but that license was revoked as a result of the police investigation that led to his conviction on arms and drugs trafficking offenses in 2008			0
the weapons he owned then were destroyed and police are continuing to investigate whether the arms used in tuesday 's attack were bought on the black market , @entity109 said			2
one of the weapons he had , a light automatic rifle , is a standard weapon in the @entity0 army , she said			0
@entity13 left no explanation for his actions , investigators have said .			2
