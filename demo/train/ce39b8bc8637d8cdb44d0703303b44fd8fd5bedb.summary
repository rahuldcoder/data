-- in his essay " @entity3 , " @entity1 writes , " judging whether life is or is not worth living amounts to answering the fundamental question of philosophy			1
" it is not a question we like to think about			0
the default assumption is that life is always worth living , that it is sacred and should be treated as such			1
when that assumption is challenged , we find ourselves confused , afraid and -- in some cases -- angry			0
the new @entity16 film " @entity17 " probably wo n't spur serious investigation of the fundamental question			1
this biopic of @entity21 , the infamous " @entity21 , " may not add anything new to the physician - assisted suicide argument , but it does remind us of a time not too long ago when we were forced to consider where we stand on the matter			1
and for many of us , where we stand is anything but firm ground			0
we believe in self - determination			1
in fact , we prize them ; we promote them ; we preach about them			0
there are n't a lot of situations in which we 're willing to take choice away from people , even if they would benefit from it			2
my research suggests that @entity46 hold on tighter to choice than just about anyone else			1
in one study , my collaborators @entity50 and @entity51 and i interviewed @entity54 and @entity46 parents who were coping with a tragic loss			2
each couple had recently lost a severely ill baby after life support had been removed			2
in @entity54 , the doctors made the decision to remove life support ; in @entity46 , the parents had the final say			1
the outcome was the same for all the parents , so did they have similar reactions ? even up to a year later , the @entity46 parents expressed a great deal more negative emotion than the @entity54 parents			2
the @entity54 made statements like this : " @entity72 was here for so little time , but he gave us so much , a new perspective on life			2
" @entity46 parents , by contrast , said things like , " i keep thinking to myself , ' what if i had chosen differently ? ' i feel as though i 've played a role in an execution			2
" although the @entity46 parents were more miserable having made the choice themselves , they would not contemplate doing otherwise			1
when they were asked whether they would have preferred to have the doctor make the decision , they all said no. they felt trapped by choice , and yet they insisted on it			0
if we can choose to take others off life support , choose to forgo medical treatment for ourselves , choose not to be resuscitated , and if these are choices we passionately defend , why do we balk at the choice of assisted suicide ? there is legitimate concern about the potential for abuse , but we 're tripped up by more than just the practical problems			1
we ask , " does n't assisted suicide devalue life ? " we express what we ca n't quite articulate by saying that it feels wrong			1
in an interview with @entity105 , as shown in the film , @entity21 argues that medical practices often seem wrong before they become right			1
he says that ether was n't used as an anesthetic for hundreds of years , that patients remained awake during surgery , " because of the foolish notion that there 's a @entity114 who wills us to suffer			0
" whether this is a fact or not , there is truth in it ; we want our suffering to have purpose			0
according to @entity1 , " @entity121 , naturally , is never easy			0
you continue making the gestures commanded by existence for many reasons , the first of which is habit			0
dying voluntarily implies that you have recognized , even instinctively , the ridiculous character of that habit , the absence of any profound reason for living , the insane character of that daily agitation , and the uselessness of suffering			0
" when we reject assisted suicide , we reject that " recognition			1
" we need the habit of life to have meaning , we need suffering to have meaning , and we certainly need death to have meaning			0
and we think of choice as a way of making meaning , not taking it away			0
actively choosing to die -- leaving no part of it to chance or other forces -- strikes us as not only devaluing life but devaluing death and devaluing choice			1
in order to have a serious conversation about assisted suicide , we may need to accept that sometimes choice , death and the choice of death do n't lead to or reveal anything greater			1
i do n't know if we 're ready for that			0
i do n't know if we should be			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			2

@entity166 : most of us think life is always worth living ; assisted suicide challenges that
@entity16 film " @entity17 , " about @entity21 , shows people choosing to die
@entity46 believe in choice and self - determination more than anyone else , @entity166 says
she writes that @entity46 see choosing to die as devaluing choice and life
