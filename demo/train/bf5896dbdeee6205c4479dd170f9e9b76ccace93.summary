" i 'm gon na tag you in this hideous photo and then unfriend you if you do n't stop oversharing and poking me			1
" if you said this to someone 10 years ago , they 'd look at you like you were speaking @entity6			2
nowadays , you just sound like an active user of social media			2
this is how much @entity10 has changed how we talk			1
in the decade since its birth in february 2004 , the social network has introduced numerous terms and phrases to the language of modern life			1
most are common words that @entity10 refitted with new meanings			1
some have stuck , while others have been forgotten			2
a few have even been recognized by dictionaries as official pieces of the 21st century lexicon			2
here are nine of the most memorable			2
friend until @entity10 came along , nobody used the word " friend " as a verb			1
now it 's not uncommon to ask a new acquaintance to spell their name so you can friend them on @entity10			1
everyone likes to feel popular			2
that 's why some @entity39 , especially in the site 's early days , hoarded friends like poker chips ( never mind that most of these " friends " were rarely seen co-workers , distant relatives or vaguely remembered classmates from junior high )			2
nobody really has 583 " friends			0
" @entity10 's " friend " also was the precursor to @entity52 's " follower , " which makes a user 's social contacts sound like members of a cult			1
unfriend @entity10 giveth , and @entity10 taketh away			1
are you tired of your uncle 's political rants ? unfriend him ! by adding an " unfriend " option , @entity10 created new shorthand for aborting a friendship or an acquaintance			1
it 's a lot easier to say , " i unfriended @entity67 " than " i 'm not going to be friends with @entity67 anymore because he annoys me with his daily musings about his toenails			0
" unfriending someone is considered a more drastic step than simply tweaking your @entity10 settings to block or minimize their posts			1
the term was officially welcomed to the digital - age vernacular by the @entity80 , which named " unfriend " its @entity81 for 2009			2
status update years ago , " status " was a measure of someone 's social or professional standing			0
then @entity10 began asking users to post updates on their thoughts or activities , and " updating your status " suddenly meant more than just moving to a better neighborhood			1
to prompt updates , @entity10 first asked users , " what are you doing right now ? " when that produced too many mundane reports -- " @entity99 is eating toast ! " -- @entity10 changed the update question in 2009 to the broader , " what 's on your mind ? " like few things have sparked more debate on @entity10 than the " like " button , which debuted in 2009 and soon spread to partner sites			1
suddenly , with a quick click you could endorse your friends ' updates , jokes and cute - kid pictures			0
cynics , lamenting what they saw as @entity10 's forced cheerfulness , unsuccessfully asked for a " dislike " button			1
@entity119 , @entity120 and other social networks also adopted the @entity123 model for favoring posts , although they used a heart symbol instead of a @entity123 thumb			0
( you like me right now ! you like me ! ) all this made " like " a noun as well as a verb , as users began collecting likes as a measure of engagement and popularity			0
as in , " i ca n't believe my cute picture of @entity137 in her @entity139 bonnet got only three likes			0
" 5 ways @entity10 changed our lives , for better or worse poke the weird @entity144 feature was sort of a thing in @entity10 's early days			1
nobody knew what it was for , exactly -- even @entity151 once said of the @entity144 , " we thought it would be cool to have a feature without any specific purpose			0
" some saw it as a flirty invitation to an online chat or real - world hookup			0
but the obvious sexual innuendo made it awkward to use in conversation			0
" i poked @entity165 " just sounds all kind of wrong			0
amazingly , the @entity144 function is still active on @entity10			1
but nobody uses it anymore unless they 're being ironic			0
share ( and overshare ) sharing used to be something we did in school when there were n't enough textbooks to go around			0
then came @entity10 , and everyone -- not just the generous -- became sharers			1
soon it was n't enough to just experience a memorable moment in our daily lives : we had to share it with everyone , right now ! share buttons popped up all over the @entity186			0
share this ! tweet this ! pin this ! snap this ! sooo much sharing			0
the word " share " has always implied a selfless , charitable act			0
but the more we share our every move and thought on social media , the more self - centered we can tend to sound			0
not me , of course			0
@entity198 for years , @entity10 encouraged visitors to a friend 's profile to " write on their @entity198			1
" it sounded sort of illicit , like an invitation to scribble graffiti			0
the idea of a digital " wall " seemed odd at a time when other social networks were promoting pages			0
maybe that 's why it never really caught on			0
in 2011 , @entity10 replaced the @entity198 with the current timeline format , which displays updates chronologically			1
it 's complicated this ambiguous answer to @entity10 's " what 's your relationship status ? " could apply to almost any romantic entanglement between " single " and " married " and is more interesting than either			1
it 's become a common response to the " how 's your love life ? " question and even inspired a 2009 romantic comedy with @entity227			1
tag tag , you 're it ! no , you 're it ! what was once just a child 's game is now a way to get people to notice your posts , or to embarrass them by flagging them in unflattering photos			2
come to think of it , maybe @entity228 is the new poke .			2
