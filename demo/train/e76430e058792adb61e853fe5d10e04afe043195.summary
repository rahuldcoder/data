-- @entity1 walks into the hotel suite at the @entity3 carrying a brown paper bag			1
it 's his sack lunch , and he 's packed it himself			1
he 's also driven himself to the hotel and arrived alone -- no entourage , no bodyguard , no assistant , no fuss			1
it 's fitting that @entity0 's interview with the iconic music star is taking place at an iconic hotel , which is like a second home to the former @entity18			1
this is where the @entity20 stayed when they first came to @entity22 in 1964 , no doubt trailed by dozens of screaming girls and photographers as they ushered in the @entity25			2
looking at least a decade younger than his 71 years , @entity1 settles into the corner of a couch and talks about celebrity then vs. celebrity now -- this from the perspective of a man who has been famous for nearly 50 years			1
" i feel like it 's harder now for the celebrities , " he tells @entity0 correspondent @entity33			1
" there was no one bigger than us , and we were put upon			2
then , @entity38 and i would go on holiday , or @entity40 and i would go on holidays , and we 'd be fine			1
now you ca n't go anywhere			2
the celebrity of today is so documented that i think it 's a lot harder now			1
we thought it was hard , but not compared to today			2
" in 2012 , his star has n't waned			2
it has just taken on a comfortable glow			2
as one of two surviving @entity18 , people are treating him like a living treasure -- and these days , he and @entity38 seem to be treasuring each other			1
@entity1 remains touched that @entity38 showed up at his 70th birthday party at @entity59			1
" i had no idea he was coming , " he recalls			2
" he jumped up to do the @entity18 track , ' birthday			2
' nobody told me that he snuck in , and that he rehearsed with the band			2
" in recent weeks , @entity1 has been busy promoting " @entity67 , " his 17th solo album			1
he produced it himself and recorded it in @entity71 with a number of his buddies , including producers @entity75 and @entity77 and @entity78 guitarist @entity76 , who also happens to be his brother - in - law			2
below is a portion of @entity0 's conversation with @entity1 about his new cd , his relationship with @entity38 and whether there will ever be a @entity18 reunion			1
@entity0 's @entity33 : what was your inspiration behind the new album ? @entity1 : the inspiration behind the cd is that 's what i do			1
i love to play , i love to hang out with musicians and i like to make records , actually			1
i like to write songs , and i like to collaborate with other writers			2
it generally keeps me busy			1
when i 'm not doing that , i like to paint , i like to watch tv , i like to go to the cinema , i like to do all that stuff			2
but i love hanging out with musicians and playing my drums			2
@entity0 : what drives you after having such a long career ? @entity1 : you get up in the morning and you start the day			1
i like to get up early , and i do n't like to get up and get right at it			2
i like to sort of work my way into the day , and then whatever comes along , i say ' yes ' or ' no ' to			2
@entity0 : does anything shock you anymore ? @entity1 : nothing shocks me , no -- not on tv			1
it is how it is now			2
it 's a pity that a lot of the reality singing shows -- somebody gets a shot for a minute , and even the winner seldom lasts more than a year			1
i played a lot of hours to get where i am , and it was a gradual build - up			2
so to go from nothing to the biggest thing in life -- you ca n't handle it			2
it was hard enough , and thank @entity131 , there were four of us to keep each other in some sort of reality			0
we all went mad separately , but we had each other , and we all came through gradually			0
so i think we were blessed that way			0
@entity0 : you got me on , " we all went mad separately			0
" @entity1 : well , we did , because we all had our moment , and then @entity40 or one of them would look at me and say , " excuse me ? ! " and pull you back , you know ? @entity0 : do you miss those days ? four instead of two ? @entity1 : well , of course i miss them			1
we were great friends , and we played a lot together , and we went through the madness together			0
there were only four people who understood what we went through , and it 's down to two now			1
there is nothing i can do to change that			0
i would like to be able to change it , but i do n't have that power			0
@entity0 : can you put the rumors to rest : will there be a @entity18 reunion at the @entity161 ? @entity1 : how can there be ? oh no , i 'll be here			1
i 'm already booked in @entity163			0
@entity0 : @entity38 said you may want to do it			1
@entity1 : @entity38 can do it			1
@entity0 : but it 's not the same without you			1
@entity1 : well , he is doing quite well without me			1
@entity0 : you 're part of the act			0
@entity1 : well , we had a great time at my birthday			1
he surprised me in @entity173 , and he jumped up to do the @entity18 track " birthday , " and i was not going to miss that so i just ran to the drum kit , and that was fun			0
we have played a couple of times together			0
we did the @entity181 show a couple of years ago , so we have done that			0
but i will not be at the @entity183			0
i have to be very definite about that because they will say , " oh , is he coming ? is n't he coming ? " no , i am not going -- but to all the athletes , " @entity188 ! " @entity0 : what about in the future ? @entity1 : well , the door is open that @entity38 and i might play together , but it is not like a reunion			1
it is not going to be the @entity18 , you know ? they have those crazy ideas that maybe we could use their children			0
it is never going to happen			0
@entity0 : what is your relationship with @entity38 like ? @entity1 : it 's good			1
after all of the time , everybody has ups and downs			0
so we have ups and downs , but it is very up right now			0
i am so pleased for him and @entity215			0
@entity0 : their wedding was beautiful			0
what was it like seeing them walk through those chapel doors ? @entity1 : great			1
it was great , and he seems really happy and that is good			0
as i said , we love @entity215 , so i think it 's a great moment for him			1
@entity0 : how would you describe @entity215 ? @entity1 : very down to earth			1
she mixes right in and she loves music , so it ca n't be bad			0
and , you know , she is a very beautiful woman			0
@entity232 is a great word			0
@entity0 : the @entity18 came up during a tumultuous time			0
do you see any parallels between that period and what 's happening today ? @entity1 : as we all know , the world is going through a change , especially in @entity242 and the @entity244 countries			1
@entity163 had to go through its change			0
@entity246 has been through several changes			0
@entity248 has been through a really big change			0
so it is just part of life , and @entity131 bless them			0
and it is great to see there is a lot of this ( gives peace sign ) going on in the world , and that is what it 's about			1
we would love to be able to say , " ok , it 's a peace and love takeover			1
" but usually whoever is in power , as it seems , is injuring a lot of its own people			0
@entity0 : you really represent your " @entity188 " theme			0
what do you hear from young people when they approach you ? @entity1 : a lot of young people love " @entity188			1
" i mean , they would like it to be that way			0
that is the way we all thought			0
but a lot of work goes into it			0
i just keep it going because it is a second in my life to think , " @entity188			0
" how great is that ? so if you put all of those seconds together , then soon you have got some time and it will make a change			0
@entity0 : what 's next for you ? @entity1 : well , i think you tackle that as it comes along			1
i am making records , i am going on tour , and then i am off to do whatever else i want to do			0
so i have a very good life .			0
