-- the @entity3 's ban on @entity5 flights to and from @entity7 's main airport for a second day marks another blow to that country 's economy and a success for @entity13 militants , experts said wednesday			1
even @entity7 officials acknowledged the economic setback in the first 24 hours of the ban , which the @entity3 will review again thursday			2
the @entity17 also recommended avoiding @entity18 in @entity19 , @entity7 , when the @entity3 imposed its ban tuesday			1
" i will not hide it from you			0
this is a major setback from @entity7 , the unfortunate @entity5 decision and what followed later was the @entity30 decisions , " said @entity24 , director of @entity25			1
" and it is a big hit to the @entity7 economy and to our pride , " he said			0
but he and other @entity7 officials insisted their country 's sophisticated anti-missile system makes @entity18 a safe place , even though a @entity13 rocket from @entity40 fell one mile away from the airfield , prompting the @entity3 temporary ban on @entity5 flights			1
" we knew about that rocket , " said @entity7 government spokesman @entity44			0
" we were tracking it for about three minutes , our @entity48			0
we could have taken it down , but because we saw that it was n't going to hit inside the airport , we let it through			0
" for some @entity5 , @entity40 conflict strikes close to home the @entity3 ban marks something of a victory for @entity13 -- as well as prudent decision to protect commercial airlines , one expert said			1
" i would say it 's both because what is the objective of terrorists ? to incite terror in people , " said @entity65 , a retired @entity66 counterterrorism agent , who was referring to @entity13			2
" i think because they probably got lucky with this one rocket that came close enough to @entity71 to make it seem like the threat was legitimate , " @entity65 added			0
" it probably seemed like an empty threat initially			0
the more and more rockets flying into @entity7 air space , ( it 's ) eventually bound to happen that they could go this far			2
these projectiles , no different than firing a bullet into the air , it 's got to drop in somewhere , and that trajectory is not well known by the person who fires it			0
" @entity7 finds @entity13 are no longer amateur fighters @entity5 sen. @entity88 , @entity89 , who flew to @entity7 a couple of months ago , said he would feel comfortable flying to @entity19 this week , despite the @entity3 decision			1
" yes , i would feel comfortable , but i can understand why the @entity3 or other airlines who have liability concerns , who are worried about not just what one or two passengers feel but what everybody feels , i understand why they 're being cautious , " @entity88 said			2
last week 's shooting down of @entity102 17 over @entity103 , " demonstrates reason for caution , " @entity88 added			0
@entity104 , a @entity13 spokesman , described the missile landing near the airport as one victory in the ongoing war between @entity13 and @entity7 in @entity40			2
" the resistance success in stopping the air traffic and isolating @entity7 from the world is a great victory for the resistance , " @entity104 told @entity109			0
another @entity13 spokesman , @entity115 , said @entity13 is targeting @entity18 " because it 's used by the @entity7 air forces			1
" former @entity118 mayor @entity117 flew wednesday to @entity7 aboard its national airline @entity120 and met with the prime minister and with president @entity122			1
@entity123 took exception with the @entity3 's temporary ban and said air travel to @entity7 was safe			1
he described the @entity19 airport and the national airline as " the world 's most secure			1
" " the fact that a rocket falls a mile away does n't mean you should shut down air traffic into a country and paralyze the country , " @entity117 said			0
@entity117 said he was " standing up for what 's right " and condemned @entity13 for trying to kill @entity7			2
referring to @entity13 ' claim of victory in disrupting air traffic , @entity117 said , " i probably do n't agree with a lot of things that @entity13 says , but that is probably true			2
" @entity145 mayor @entity144 said if @entity7 thought flying there was a risk , " i would have called @entity117 ( @entity123 ) and said , ' do n't come			1
' " the reality is that if @entity13 goes ' boo ' and you get scared , you 're helping @entity13 with its goals , " @entity144 said			1
" that 's what terrorists try to do			0
they try to terrorize you			0
" the best way to fight terrorism is exactly go on with your normal life , " the mayor said			0
