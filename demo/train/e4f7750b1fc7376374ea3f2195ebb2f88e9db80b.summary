-- @entity1 is so important to the re-election chances of @entity4 that he picked @entity5 as the host city for the @entity8 nominating convention			1
on may 8 , all his careful plans came crashing down when 61 % of voters in a @entity1 referendum adopted a constitutional amendment defining marriage as the union of one man and one woman			1
pre-election polls showed that a majority of @entity8 voters supported this amendment , as did independents and an overwhelming majority of african - americans and @entity24			0
before the @entity1 vote , @entity4 publicly opposed @entity26 , and gay activists used this in an attempt to rally @entity8 and independents , and especially @entity23 , to oppose the measure			1
this failed miserably , and when polls started to predict @entity26 would pass , @entity4 canceled an election day trip to the state			2
then vice president @entity35 popped off that he saw no problem with same - sex marriage			1
finally , a day after the @entity1 vote , @entity4 admitted what had been obvious for a long time -- he supports redefining marriage			1
@entity4 's embrace of same - sex marriage will help ensure he becomes a one - term president , and his political demise will begin with @entity1			1
despite what many in the media claim , the @entity47 people do not support same - sex marriage			1
they sure as heck do n't in @entity1 , where voters made it clear they want to prevent activist judges and politicians like @entity4 from redefining marriage			1
the @entity57 , which i head , helped lead the @entity1 campaign			0
our victory for marriage was so impressive that the prominent @entity64 firm sent out this @entity66 missive as the results came in : " hate to say it , but i do n't believe polls showing majority support for gay marriage nationally			0
any time there 's a vote , it does n't back it up			0
" support for traditional marriage in @entity1 and across the nation is heavily rooted in the faith traditions of voters			2
in 2008 , candidate @entity4 acknowledged that as a @entity81 , " @entity82 's in the mix " when it comes to understanding the definition of marriage			2
where is @entity82 now in his political calculation ? it seems he 's decided to ignore what the creator says about marriage and base his flip - flop on generalities about the " @entity95			2
" regardless , endorsing gay marriage is n't going to fly in @entity1 , and it is n't going to fly in any of the other swing states that have marriage amendments on the books -- including @entity100 , @entity101 , @entity102 , @entity103 and @entity104 -- all adopted by voters			2
@entity4 is now claiming that he supports the " concept " of states deciding the marriage issue themselves			0
his administration has agreed to enforce the 1996 @entity112 , which is the legal framework that allows a state to control its own definition of marriage and avoid having to recognize same - sex marriages performed elsewhere			1
but the @entity118 has refused to defend the law in federal court			0
if @entity4 gets his way and @entity112 is overturned , it 's only a matter of time before marriage is redefined for the entire country			2
now he has signed up as an official cheerleader for that outcome			0
as if that was n't enough , same - sex marriage radicals will descend on @entity5 and demand that the cause become a central plank of the @entity8 platform			1
@entity134 is already enthusiastic about the prospect			0
the president has tied his presidency to a cause that has never been successful with voters -- not in a single state -- not at any time			0
not in blue states such as @entity143 and certainly not in swing states such as @entity1			0
what @entity4 has just succeeded in doing is to give an incredibly powerful reason to hundreds of thousands of social conservatives , and especially evangelicals , across @entity47 to rally behind @entity149 if they want to preserve marriage -- and they most decidedly do want to preserve marriage			1
the people of faith in @entity47 know that the future of marriage is on the line , and as has been proved in 32 votes across this nation , they will not fail the cause of marriage			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0

@entity1 voted to define marriage as the union of one man and one woman
@entity166 : @entity4 's stance on same - sex marriage will make sure he is a one - term president
@entity4 has taken on a cause that has never been supported in a state referendum , he says
@entity166 : the president 's stance gives hundreds of thousands a reason to vote for @entity149
