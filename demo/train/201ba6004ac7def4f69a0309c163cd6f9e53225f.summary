-- @entity1 stunned many people with an op - ed tuesday describing her reasons for choosing to have a preventive double mastectomy			1
her mother passed away at the age of 56 after battling ovarian cancer			0
moreover , @entity1 found that she had the @entity9 gene , which significantly increases the lifetime risk of breast cancer			1
in fact , she reports that her doctors estimated that she had an 87 % chance of developing breast cancer			0
i have no doubt that this piece is causing many women across the country to think about their own health and chances of developing the disease			2
thanks to many successful organizations , breast cancer awareness is at an all - time high in the @entity27			2
a person of @entity1 's stature publicly discussing such a personal and difficult decision will likely weigh on the minds of many women who have similar concerns			1
breast cancer is a real disease , it 's not rare , and it can potentially strike almost anyone			2
i have no doubt that her op - ed in the @entity39 will help many women who would not have considered this procedure to do so now			1
five reasons we love @entity1 in one sense , that is a good thing			1
there are legitimate and real reasons for some women to consider a preventive , or prophylactic , mastectomy			1
some women who have had breast cancer in one breast elect to have a mastectomy of the other breast to prevent the cancer from spreading there			1
some women who have a family history of cancer , especially before age 50 , might consider the procedure			2
more recently , women who have been able to learn through genetic testing that they have the @entity9 or @entity65 gene , both of which make it more likely that they might develop cancer , have been given new information that may help them make a decision			1
it 's a personal decision			1
it 's also a serious one , because there are downsides to a preventive mastectomy as well			1
first of all , it 's still a major procedure , and it carries all the risks of one ; one should never minimize the risks of a big operation			2
it 's also irreversible , and some women do suffer psychological or physical consequences afterward			1
no one should ever judge another woman 's decision in this area , but it would serve individual patients poorly for doctors not to discuss with them both the potential harms as well as benefits			1
opinion : @entity1 's brave message it 's also important to recognize that even a preventive mastectomy is not a guarantee against cancer			1
studies show that it 's about 90 % effective in preventing breast cancer in moderate and high - risk women			1
that still leaves a 10 % chance of developing cancer in the chest wall , armpit or even in the abdomen			0
that 's because it 's pretty much impossible for even the best surgeon to remove all breast tissue from a woman			2
because of this , some women choose not to have the procedure done , even when they are at high risk			0
just a few weeks ago , @entity115 wrote a compelling account of her decision not to undergo the procedure after her first brush with breast cancer			1
her reasons are just as valid and important as @entity1 's but may not make the same splash in our national discussion			1
part of the reason for that is that there are few stars with @entity1 's fame who could claim this sort of attention			1
but there 's a larger current here that is worth considering			0
we in @entity27 sometimes are risk averse			0
we favor trying to reduce the chance of something bad happening to as close to zero as possible			0
we also tend to err on the side of doing something rather than nothing			0
there 's nothing inherently wrong with this type of behavior			0
but we should recognize it			0
my preventive mastectomy : staying alive for my kids we tend to screen more than other countries			0
we tend to push for more invasive and technologically driven solutions			0
we do these things , sometimes , at the expense of both health and money			0
in the last few years , there has been some pushback against the potential over-use ( and detriment ) of mammograms and prostate specific antigen tests			0
such debates are controversial but important			0
you ca n't reduce risk to nothing			0
trying to do so will lead to practices none of us would support			0
after all , someone could make the argument that we should remove all breast tissue from all women because you never know where breast cancer will strike			2
that 's hyperbolic , and no one is suggesting it , but it shows that this is really a personal , and individual decision			2
that 's how it should be			0
@entity1 's relating her decision to have a preventive mastectomy is no more or less brave than @entity115 's decision not to have one			1
but both are welcome in their bringing to the forefront that these are discussions that every woman should have with their physicians , their loved ones and themselves			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity199 .			2

@entity201 : jolie op - ed on elective double mastectomy was brave , *raised* consciousness
women have more info today to make such a decision , but it also has downsides , he says
he says other women , such as @entity115 , have written about opting not to do it
@entity199 : @entity1 's decision was brave , but @entity115 's was , too
