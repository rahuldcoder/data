-- as they contemplate military action against @entity3 , one of many considerations members of @entity5 and @entity7 administration officials have to weigh is how a @entity9 strike against the regime of @entity11 might effect the already complicated , even poisonous , state of @entity14 relations in the region			1
three of the leading @entity14 states , @entity18 , @entity19 and the @entity20 , have already offered their military assets if a @entity9 strike happens			1
last week , @entity24 president @entity23 said that the @entity14 government of @entity24 and close @entity3 ally @entity27 would work in " extensive cooperation " to protect @entity3			2
an @entity9 - led war in @entity3 with the military backing of some powerful @entity14 states against a @entity33 alliance of @entity24 , @entity3 , @entity34 and @entity36 @entity35 would likely greatly exacerbate the already tense relations between @entity14 and @entity33 across the region			1
in @entity3 , a popular uprising against a repressive ruler in 2011 has morphed into what is now a largely sectarian civil war pitting the country 's @entity44 majority against @entity11 's minority @entity47 sect , which is associated with @entity49			2
the @entity3 regime is propped up with weapons and funds from @entity24 's @entity14 rulers and also benefits significantly from the support on the ground of battle - hardened fighters from @entity36 @entity35 , an @entity24 proxy			1
as a possible @entity9 strike looms in @entity3 , what had hitherto been a shadowy proxy war , with @entity14 countries such as @entity18 quietly supporting the @entity3 rebels and @entity24 supporting @entity11 , could now devolve into a full - blown war that is openly supported by the most powerful @entity14 and @entity33 states			1
that is a real potential problem that needs to be weighed by @entity7 national security officials and representatives in @entity5 as they consider the options in @entity3 , because across the @entity44 world from @entity36 to @entity72 , @entity65 and @entity49 are increasingly at each other 's throats			2
a further intensification of the already brutal @entity3 civil war might further destabilize @entity3 's fragile neighbors ; both @entity36 and @entity34 could plunge back into civil wars			1
already in july , the @entity79 recorded the highest death toll in @entity34 since 2008 , when the @entity81 was raging			1
in that month alone , more than 1,057 civilians and security personnel were killed			0
many of those deaths were the result of bombings claimed by the @entity14 terrorist group @entity88 in @entity34 and were directed at @entity14 targets			1
a splinter organization of @entity88 in @entity34 is now fighting in @entity3 and is regarded as the most effective force fighting @entity11 , who it deems a heretic			1
it 's a very old story			0
the two dominant sects of @entity49 , @entity14 and @entity33 , first split over the issue of who was the rightful successor of the @entity100 following his death in 632			2
the conflict between the two sects has waxed and waned over the many centuries since , but right now the @entity3 conflict could exacerbate the regional split along sectarian lines that we have seen over the past few years			1
in 2011 the @entity14 monarchy of the @entity111 state of @entity112 backed by more than a thousand soldiers from @entity18 put down with harsh tactics an uprising by its disadvantaged @entity14 majority population			0
the @entity112 government hinted that the uprising was an @entity24 plot			0
the sectarian conflicts in @entity3 , @entity34 and @entity112 have also spilled over into @entity36 and @entity120			1
on june 23 , in @entity36 's port city of @entity123 , soldiers clashed with supporters of a hardline @entity14 cleric , @entity125 , who had spoken out vehemently against the @entity3 regime as well as the @entity14 @entity36 militant group , @entity35			2
on the same day , four @entity120 @entity49 were stabbed , beaten , and dragged through the streets by members of a hardline @entity14 group in the @entity132 neighborhood of @entity133			0
the intensifying sectarian tensions in @entity120 were partially the fault of the recently - ousted @entity137 government			0
a week before the @entity132 attack , for example , president @entity138 had appeared on stage with hardline clerics who called @entity49 " filthy			0
" and in may , @entity144 members of @entity120 's parliament denounced shias as " a danger to @entity120 's national security			0
" beyond the @entity150 , sectarian violence has also soared in @entity151 over the past few years			0
more than 180 members of @entity72 's minority @entity154 community were killed in two massive bombings in the first two months of 2013 alone			0
in neighboring @entity158 , violent attacks on @entity49 are less frequent , but in december 2011 , two nearly simultaneous suicide bombs in @entity160 and @entity161 killed more than 60 @entity14 civilians as they celebrated the annual religious festival of @entity164			0
we can expect sectarian tensions to continue boiling across the @entity44 world , as the @entity3 conflict grinds on and political and social unrest persist in many countries in the region			2
@entity88 - affiliated groups will seek to exploit these sectarian divisions to garner support for their own violent agenda , and may well find greater room to operate because of it			1
@entity18 and @entity177 have mobilized their deep coffers to support extremist @entity14 groups in the past , and will continue to do so as long as it means they are able to counterbalance @entity24 and its support for @entity14 regimes and militant groups			2
all of these factors must be weighed as the @entity9 weighs military action			0
they are not an argument for doing nothing in the face of @entity11 's large - scale use of chemical weapons but they are a reason to heed @entity196 's warning " wars begin when you will , but they do not end when you please			0

@entity200 : complicating the @entity3 picture is *regionwide* sectarian strife
he says the *historic* @entity14 split is a *key* *dynamic* and @entity9 strike could worsen conflict
@entity34 's death toll from sectarian struggles has been increasing
@entity212 : @entity88 - affiliated groups will seek to take advantage
