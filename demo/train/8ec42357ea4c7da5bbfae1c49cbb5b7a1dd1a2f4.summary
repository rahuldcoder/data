-- april 12 , 2011 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 @entity6 transcript this is a @entity9			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity13 , @entity14 : i 'm @entity16 , and this is @entity0 ! we do n't need 80 days			2
we 're taking you around the world in 10 minutes			2
@entity21 , @entity22 , @entity23			2
but we 're starting things off in western @entity25			2
first up : @entity26 @entity27 : the civil war that 's been raging in the nation of @entity4 seems to be coming to an end			1
in fact , a @entity32 representative said yesterday that while there are still some small signs of resistance , to his knowledge , most of the fighting has stopped			2
that is because @entity41 , @entity4 's former president , was arrested on monday			1
this is @entity41 , and this is the hotel that he was taken to yesterday			2
it 's the headquarters of both the @entity32 group in @entity4 and of @entity46 , the man who defeated @entity41 in last year 's presidential election			1
@entity41 refused to step down despite having lost the election , and that is what led to the violence			2
thousands fleeing from the country			2
now that @entity41 's been taken in , one @entity55 official said @entity4 can start to return to normal			1
@entity57 @entity56 @entity27 : moving northeast across @entity25 , we come to @entity57			2
that country 's government and military , led by @entity62 , have been fighting against rebels who want him out of power			1
the @entity66 has come up with a plan to end that fighting			1
they 're calling it a " road map			2
" what it would do is immediately stop the fighting and help bring humanitarian aid into @entity57			2
colonel @entity62 has signed off on the plan			2
but the rebels who are fighting against him have n't			2
the plan does n't force @entity62 to step down from power , so he could continue to lead @entity57			0
and while rebel leaders say they 're open to ideas , they say @entity62 leaving power has to be included			0
@entity85 @entity27 : in @entity5 , rescue workers briefly stopped their search yesterday as the nation paused to remember the victims of the deadly earthquake and tsunami that hit exactly one month earlier			0
special ceremonies , moments of silence paying tribute to the more than 13,000 people who were killed and the more than 14,000 others who are still missing			0
just a short time later , @entity5 was hit by another earthquake			0
there have been hundreds of these aftershocks since the quake on march 11th			0
yesterday 's had a magnitude of 6.6			1
it caused landslides that trapped several people in one city			0
it also caused a temporary evacuation at that troubled nuclear power plant where engineers have been trying to cool down nuclear reactors			0
just the facts @entity114 , @entity14 : just the facts ! @entity116 is an @entity118 word that dates back to the 1800s			0
it is an article of clothing that covers someone 's face and body			1
burqas are often associated with @entity126 , as they are worn by some @entity128 women			0
@entity129 @entity27 : in @entity6 , it 's illegal to wear a burqa according to a new law that went into effect this week			1
two women who were protesting the ban were arrested on monday			0
police say they were n't arrested for wearing burqas , but rather for being part of an unauthorized protest			0
@entity6 officials say burqas pose a security concern and affect the dignity of women who wear them			1
but critics of the ban say it violates @entity22 human rights laws			0
she has more on this new law and the reaction to it			1
( begin video ) @entity150 , @entity154 correspondent : a highly controversial law has gone into effect , and it 's the talk of the country , as you can imagine			1
in fact , i 'm going to hold up just a section of @entity163 newspaper here			0
the headline is " the full veil is banned on the road			0
" it actually has a small diagram here to show exactly what is allowed and what is not allowed in @entity6 now			1
the burqa , which covers the entire face , is banned			1
the niqab , which covers everything but the eyes , is also banned			0
but the hijab , which covers the head but leaves the face unveiled , is allowed			0
now , the nuts and bolts of this law : basically , it is now illegal for anyone to wear a full veil covering on the streets of @entity6 in public			1
and in public , it means anywhere on the streets , in a public office , such as a post office or a train station , even in a cinema , it is not allowed			0
really , the only place where the full veil is allowed is in a car , the private vehicle , or in the privacy of your own home			0
there are only an estimated less than 2,000 women in @entity6 that actually wear the full veil , so it wo n't impact that many people , but it is highly controversial			1
now , @entity0 did have the opportunity to speak to one woman who is wearing the full veil and says she will continue to wear the full veil even as this law goes into effect			1
and she told us what she thinks of this new face of @entity6			1
@entity216 , veil @entity217 in @entity6 [ @entity218 ] : in all honesty , i 'm just sad			1
i 'm just sad and disappointed , because quite frankly to get to this point , i think it 's very revealing about many things			1
and thankfully , thankfully , not all of the @entity6 population think like the politicians who voted this law			1
@entity228 : now , even though this only affects a small portion of women here in @entity6 , this law is very popular			1
it was passed with an overwhelming majority in @entity6 's parliament			1
and in the most latest polls , more than 80 % of @entity6 respondent say they support the law			1
@entity150 , @entity0 , @entity240			0
( @entity241 ) @entity242 @entity27 : to @entity244 , @entity245 : the @entity243 just finished up one round of financial debate			0
there are several more of those to go , and one of the big ones coming up soon is about the @entity55 debt ceiling			1
now , that is the legal limit for how much money the @entity55 can borrow			1
@entity243 has about a month to work on this			0
but with a two - week spring break coming up , that does n't leave a whole lot of time			1
so , what is the current debt ceiling ? how close are we to it ? and what are the options facing @entity243 ? @entity266 is here to help break it all down			1
( begin video ) @entity266 , @entity0 chief business correspondent : the real fight , the one that 's getting started , is over the country 's debt limit			1
by law , the amount that the @entity55 can carry , the amount of debt that the @entity55 can carry , is $ 14.294 trillion			1
it 's a credit limit that @entity243 sets			1
now , that 's what they can borrow			1
here 's where we stand right now			2
the actual current debt of the @entity55 : $ 14.208 trillion			1
the difference between the two is $ 86 billion			0
now , the @entity55 is going to exceed this limit by may the 16th , based on current spending			1
the government can pull a few tricks and get away with being over the limit until about july 8th			0
but not increasing this credit limit is going to create some problems			0
now , there are two scenarios for what could happen if @entity243 does n't raise that debt limit by may 16th			2
neither of them are good			0
the government can cut spending or it can raise taxes			0
they need to raise $ 738 billion to keep the country running until the end of the fiscal year , which is september 30th			2
but @entity308 oppose cuts and oppose increasing taxes , so if they do n't do that , the @entity55 could default on its loans			1
that could create a big problem			0
that could send the dollar plummeting			0
it could send oil prices higher			0
it could hobble an already delicate economy , which is why this , this debt ceiling , is going to become the focus of our attentions for the next month			1
( @entity241 ) @entity326 @entity327 , @entity14 : today 's shoutout goes out to ms. @entity330 's computer class at @entity331 in @entity332 , @entity333 ! @entity336 was where the first shots were fired in what war ? you know what to do ! was it the : a ) @entity341 , b ) @entity342 , c ) @entity344 or @entity345 ) @entity56 ? you 've got three seconds -- go ! the shots fired at @entity336 marked the start of the @entity56			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! @entity352 @entity27 : those shots were fired exactly 150 years ago today			1
the @entity56 , also known as the @entity56 , killed more @entity55 troops than any other @entity55 war			1
and it all started here : at @entity336 in @entity359 's @entity358			2
@entity361 troops opened fire on the fort			0
the @entity66 commander surrendered the next day , and the @entity56 had begun			0
many @entity56 battles are played out today in re-enactments like this one			2
you might 've seen one nearby where you live			0
the @entity56 lasted four years , with the @entity359 ultimately surrendering in april of 1865			0
before we go @entity27 : well , we promised you five continents at the beginning of today 's show , and that can be a tall order			1
in fact , when it comes to towers built out of @entity380 , this is the tallest			0
it took 6,000 people working on this -- and , yes , they needed a crane -- in @entity386 , @entity387 to put it together			0
500,000 @entity380 stacked up more than 102 feet high			0
something like this takes a lot of planning , a good strategy			0
so , no matter how fast the finished product comes together ... goodbye @entity27 : ... we are sure they were toying around with the idea for a while			0
will that tower be a building block for future world record attempts ? if you ask me , for those builders , the sky 's the limit			2
but for now , we 'll " lego " of this story			0
for @entity0 , i 'm @entity16			0
we will look forward to seeing you tomorrow			0
