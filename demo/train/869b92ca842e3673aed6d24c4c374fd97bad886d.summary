@entity1 's brother @entity0 died of a pulmonary embolism in 2007 , at age 38			0
diagnosed with bipolar disorder in high school , he had been on antipsychotic drugs for years			1
at the time of his death , he was carrying 280 pounds on his 6 - foot - 4 - inch frame			2
@entity10 , a public relations specialist who works at @entity11 in @entity12 , knew that @entity0 's medications could cause weight gain			0
but she had never been told that the drugs he was taking might be harming his heart			2
" we were never counseled by his psychiatrist or his primary care provider to watch for symptoms of heart disease or any risk of sudden death at all , " @entity10 says			2
there 's no evidence that @entity0 's medications caused his death , but his family might have been able to get him help sooner if they had known about the risks , @entity10 explains			2
new research published wednesday in the @entity32 shows that antipsychotic drugs are not risk free , and the study 's authors are urging much more caution in their use			1
the drugs are associated with a risk of sudden cardiac death , particularly at higher doses			1
@entity43 10 best foods for your heart @entity10 's brother was taking haloperidol , which belongs to an older class of drugs called typical antipsychotics , which have long been known to increase the risk of sudden death due to cardiac causes			1
he was also on risperidone , a member of a newer class of drugs called atypical antipsychotics , which had been considered safer			1
doctors prescribe these newer medications , originally developed to treat schizophrenia , for a wide variety of problems -- from conduct disorder in kids to aggressive behavior in @entity67 's patients			0
in fact , they 've become so popular that three of them -- olanzapine , risperidone , and quetiapine -- are among the 10 top - selling drugs worldwide , with $ 14.5 billion in sales in 2007			1
the new study suggests that among patients taking high doses of atypical antipsychotics , there are about 3.3 cases of sudden cardiac death per 1,000 patients per year , which an editorial characterizes as a risk that 's " between ' moderate ' and ' low , ' but not ' rare			1
' " @entity43 : heart drug may be a cancer fighter about 325,000 people in the @entity88 each year die of sudden cardiac death , which has an incidence of 0.1 to 0.2 percent per year in adults			1
" [ the drugs ] have potentially very serious side effects , " says @entity92 , @entity93 , the director of the division of pharmacoepidemiology at @entity96 , in @entity97			2
" so whenever a decision is made to use one , consideration of potential side effects needs to be made			0
" @entity92 and his colleagues found that atypical antipsychotics doubled the risk of sudden death from heart - related causes , most likely by causing disturbances in heart rhythms			1
first introduced in the mid-nineties , atypical antipsychotics were praised for having none of the troublesome side effects of their predecessors , including frequent , involuntary movements of the face and mouth that were in some cases irreversible			1
but the new study shows that the increased risk of sudden cardiac death seen with the older drugs is nearly identical to that of the newer medications			1
there had been suspicions that the drugs were risky , especially when used in older patients , but the current study is the first to systematically investigate their association with sudden cardiac death			1
@entity92 and his colleagues reviewed data on @entity134 patients , comparing 44,218 people using older typical antipsychotics and 46,089 taking the newer atypical antipsychotics to 186,600 people who had never used the drugs			1
people with schizophrenia may have a higher rate of cardiac problems , due to smoking and other factors			2
to account for this , researchers also compared antipsychotic drug users without schizophrenia to non-drug users who had characteristics ( in most cases , mood disorders ) that made them likely candidates for the drugs			2
overall , people taking typical antipsychotics were at 1.99 - times greater risk of sudden cardiac death , while the risk for those on atypical antipsychotics was increased 2.26 times			1
the increased risk was greater for people on higher doses of the drugs			1
people who had used the drugs in the past but stopped were n't at greater risk of sudden cardiac death			1
" the drugs are still very effective for conditions that there 's proven evidence for , " says @entity169 , @entity170 , a professor and chair of psychiatry at @entity11 , in @entity12 , and the director of the @entity174 , who was not involved with @entity92 's research			2
" they clearly need to still be able to be used			0
i think this [ study ] really underscores the need to be very judicious about how these medications are used and whom they 're given to			0
" while atypical antipsychotics have been used to ease aggressive behavior for patients with alzheimer 's disease , for example , they are not approved for this purpose by the @entity194 ; in fact , in 2005 , the @entity194 issued a warning that these drugs increased the risk of death among elderly people , extending the warning to all antipsychotic drugs last year , notes @entity203 , @entity170 , @entity204 , an associate professor of medicine at @entity207 , in @entity208 , who coauthored an editorial accompanying the current study			1
@entity211 : how is depression in the elderly different from dementia ? given the lack of better alternatives , these drugs are still widely used in patients with dementia despite the warnings , he adds			0
but while there 's anecdotal evidence that they will " cool these patients down " and reduce their aggressive behaviors , there 's no scientific evidence that they really help patients or their caregivers , dr. @entity203 says			0
in his editorial , dr. @entity203 and coauthor @entity231 , @entity170 , also of @entity207 , call for patients to undergo an electrocardiogram before and shortly after being placed on atypical antipsychotics , to determine if the drugs are causing any heart rhythm disturbances			1
for people who must be on these medications , @entity92 says , it 's essential for their doctors to treat any other conditions , such as high blood pressure , that can harm the heart			0
" sudden cardiac death usually occurs when multiple risk factors are present , " he explains			1
" when you add one , it 's kind of like the straw that broke the camel 's back			0
" " absolutely the lowest dose that works should be used , because we found a strong dose response , " @entity92 says			0
@entity254 , a spokesperson for @entity255 , the maker of @entity256 , says , " although the study appears to have important limitations , it provides additional information for practicing physicians to consider as they decide how to treat very complex diseases such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder			0
" the @entity194 has approved atypical antipsychotics for treating bipolar disorder , @entity92 adds			2
but the researcher recommends that physicians first try safer alternatives , such as the mood stabilizer lithium			0
" that 's a very serious illness , and it has important consequences for patients ' quality of life and relationships , " @entity92 notes			0
" if the mood stabilizer does n't work , i think it 's very reasonable to consider an antipsychotic , but ... other drugs should be considered first			2
" finally , he says , a patient should never stop taking any drug without consulting his or her physician			0
nevertheless , anyone taking an atypical antipsychotic for a non-fda - approved use should consult his physician			1
" i think off - label use should be undertaken very cautiously , and its frequency should be much less than it is currently , " @entity92 says			0
@entity211 : superfoods that can save your health for @entity1 , the new research makes it clear that treating serious mental illness must go far beyond just prescribing pills			0
" we need to be supporting these people in a better , more systematic way , " she says			0
" there 's no magic pill			0
it 's treating the whole person			0

atypical antipsychotic drugs associated with higher risk of sudden cardiac death
atypicals were thought to be safer than older , so - called " typical " antipsychotics
three atypical antipsychotics are among the 10 top - selling drugs worldwide
