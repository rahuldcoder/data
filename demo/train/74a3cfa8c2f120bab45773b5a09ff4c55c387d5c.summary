-- actress @entity1 started @entity2 , an organization that supports animals in need			1
@entity1 recently sat down with @entity0 's @entity5 to talk about @entity6 and how she promotes the bond between people and their pets			1
below are excerpts from that interview			0
@entity5 : what is @entity13 ? @entity1 : i started @entity2 probably five years ago			1
my idea was animals helping people who help animals			2
maybe an animal needs to be matched to the right home of someone in need , and then ( that ) ultimately helps the animal , too			2
we do a lot with local shelters that need money for spays ; getting money for spays is a big issue			1
i 'd like to see animals get their shots , so we help with that			2
we all need to give how we can , but in my hometown of @entity37 , @entity38 , and my new hometowns of @entity40 and @entity41 , we work locally with people and animals who need help			1
@entity5 : what inspired you to start @entity2 ? @entity1 : animals inspire me every day			1
i grew up in @entity38 around a lot of animals , and a lot of my relatives are farmers and ranchers			1
i have a lot of respect for all kinds and what they can bring to our lives			2
i finally became one of those @entity41 that got a little white fluffy dog			0
i never thought that she 'd take over my life , but she 's given me such joy and she 's made me so happy			0
i love show business , but this dog basically reminds me of what 's important			1
my family loves her ; my mom and dad look at her like it 's their own grandchild			0
through @entity13 's corner , i 've gotten to meet other dogs that are in need			1
just recently i got to do a morning show in @entity41 , and it was adoption day			0
i got to bring a dog on , and that dog got adopted that day			0
there are still so many animals in need , and adoption should not be ruled out			0
@entity5 : what 's the inspiration behind the name ? @entity1 : @entity92 is my dog			1
@entity92 was a big hero of mine , a wonderful actress and singer who actually passed away of cancer			1
she was an artistic , funny lady , someone who inspired me and is one of my personal heroes			0
so it seemed right to have a charity and a dog named after her			1
@entity5 : why did you get involved in @entity6 ? @entity1 : i look forward every year to finding out who the @entity6 are , because they 're everyday people			2
it has become even more important to me because i have a cousin who is serving for our country in @entity112			0
those people , it goes without saying , are our heroes			0
it 's become more important to me to find out more about our military ; more about everyday people ; more about a place called the @entity119 , where sisters feed the homeless ; more about women who are helping animals			2
@entity124 's an amazing thing , and that 's what @entity6 celebrates			0
that 's what they show through this tribute show , and that 's why i 'm so proud to be involved .			0

@entity1 started a *nonprofit* that works with local animal shelters
@entity13 's corner is named after @entity1 's dog , who is named after late actress @entity92
