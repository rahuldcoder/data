-- it was the cruelest of ironies unleashed by @entity3			0
one of the strongest ever recorded , the storm put the @entity6 port city of @entity8 underwater , and storm chaser @entity10 was there filming the natural disaster at what 's been regarded as its ground zero			1
then , when evening fell , the town caught fire			1
there was water , water , everywhere -- yet nary enough to put out a fire , @entity10 said			1
the surge of sea water was followed by a sea of flames			1
interactive map of the storm the futility -- and absurdity -- of the moment was captured by one merchant using buckets of water against the inferno in his shop			1
the merchant did n't stand a chance , said @entity10 , who 's from @entity40 , @entity41			1
" one block of the city was up in flames , a raging fire was burning uncontrollably , " @entity10 said in telephone interview from the @entity6			1
" i honestly felt like it was some sort of disaster movie			0
it was so bad , it did n't seem real			0
this struck home hard that this was a city in a desolate state , " he said			0
' worse than hell ' nothing else like this storm @entity59 was the worst storm that @entity10 , 30 , has ever chased			1
since 2005 , he and his @entity62 crew have filmed 35 typhoons -- plus a couple of major volcanic eruptions including @entity65 in @entity66 in 2010			2
they also covered the aftermath of the @entity70 tsunami in 2011			0
" it was without a doubt the most catastrophic event i 've witnessed before my eyes , " @entity10 said of the super typhoon			1
" to actually go through a disaster as it takes place and then be there afterward just compares to nothing			0
it 'll probably be the only time in my life			0
" the experience was n't without casualties to crew and gear , however			0
one team member suffered a six - inch gash down to the bone of his leg , @entity10 said			1
so the team managed to get a helicopter ride to the @entity8 airport			1
road travel was n't possible because downed trees and utility poles closed streets			0
from the airport , the @entity6 military was kind enough to give the film crew a plane ride saturday to @entity100 , where medical care was available			1
the storm also destroyed most of @entity10 ' camera gear , so he used a small backup camera and even his @entity105 to film the biblical - like flooding of @entity8 -- until his batteries began to die			1
@entity6 gets more than its share of disasters the team had no choice but to cut short its extraordinary work in @entity8			2
@entity10 and his crew filmed the height of flooding while at a @entity8 hotel			1
there , guests on the first floor had to be ferried out of danger while afloat on mattresses , including one elderly woman escorted by good samaritans wading through the waist - high water			0
the first - floor guests could n't open their doors against the rising water , so they smashed windows to try to exit			0
a @entity0 crew assisted ; its members also were staying at the hotel			2
" it was really put the cameras down , we 've got to get out there and help these people			0
otherwise possibly they could drown , " @entity10 said			2
the first - floor guests were taken to higher ground			0
" the water was coming in everywhere , even in the heart of the hotel , " @entity10 said			1
" and my camera gave up			0
all the batteries were drained , and there was no electricity			0
" ' you could feel the whole hotel ... shaking ' @entity10 chose the hotel because it was made of concrete , was about five miles inland and had an elevation of four stories , well above the surge of ocean that was expected to sweep over the coastal city -- and did			1
the crew got lucky : they checked into the last available room on the fourth floor			0
even if there was no room at the inn , they would have slept in the hallway of the fourth floor , just for the safe refuge , @entity10 said			2
" during the height of the storm , the scream of the wind was deafening			0
we could hear just thunderous crashes of debris flying through the air			0
at some points , you could feel the whole hotel , which was made of solid concrete , shaking , " @entity10 said			1
to film the apocalyptic moment , the crew arrived in @entity8 on thursday from their @entity177 offices			1
they initially checked into small waterfront hotel and then moved to a beach resort , but they abandoned both places as they received reports of the impending storm 's ferocity			2
@entity8 emerges as one of @entity59 's most damaged targets for all their efforts , they found the most cinematic moment in the silence after the super typhoon passed			1
it was friday night , and @entity10 was standing on his hotel 's roof			1
a blackout enveloped the town			2
then the sky became afire			2
" you could see the city skyline illuminated by lighting			0
the city was up in flames			0
and it was surreal , " @entity10 said			2
for all the peril and loss , would @entity10 do it again ? " yes ! " he said			2
but not for a while , he added			0

@entity10 and his *production* crew arrive in @entity8 just to film the super typhoon
they change hotels three times , only to find themselves filming *rescues* in flooded hotel
water , water , everywhere , yet nary enough to put out a fire in town , he *recounts*
then , in the blackout after the storm , the sky is afire with *lightning* and flames
