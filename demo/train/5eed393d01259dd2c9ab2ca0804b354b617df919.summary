-- a group of former top counternarcotics officials are taking on attorney general @entity3 over the @entity5 's decision to soften its stance on marijuana legalization			1
nine former administrators of the @entity9 wrote @entity3 to criticize the department 's decision not to challenge laws in @entity14 and @entity13 , which are allowing legal recreational use of marijuana after voter - approved ballot measures			1
more than two dozen other states and the @entity19 allow medicinal use of marijuana			0
the @entity5 last month issued new guidelines to prosecutors intended to focus on more serious trafficking offenses , largely avoiding a conflict with state laws			2
the federal government still classifies marijuana as one of the most dangerous substances , and it remains illegal under federal law			2
buoyed by the @entity5 's move and by public polls showing increasing voter support , pro-marijuana activists are now looking to the ballot box to legalize marijuana in more states			1
the nine former @entity9 chiefs , who span the years of the @entity41 @entity40 dating to the 1970s , are n't moved by changing public opinion on the issue			0
in the letter dated monday , they say they were " shocked and dismayed " by @entity3 's move			0
" you took an oath of office , as each of us did , to support and defend the @entity50 of the @entity41 , " the former @entity9 officials say			0
" great harm will be done in @entity14 and @entity13 and throughout the country with the legalization of marijuana			1
" the @entity5 did n't immediately respond to a request for comment .			0
