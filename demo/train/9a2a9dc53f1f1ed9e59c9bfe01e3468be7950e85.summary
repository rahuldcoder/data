maybe you got the email , too ? it landed in my inbox at 1:58 a.m. on thursday			0
" to our members : safeguarding your personal , financial and medical information is one of our top priorities , and because of that , we have state - of - the - art information security systems to protect your data			1
" however , despite our efforts ... @entity19 ... " ... @entity20 was the target of a very sophisticated external cyber attack			1
" wait , what the ... " these attackers gained unauthorized access to @entity20 's it system and have obtained personal information from our current and former members such as their names , birthdays , medical ids / social security numbers , street addresses , e-mail addresses and employment information , including income data			1
" @entity38 ! income data ! & # ^ @ ! it 's not the first email you want to open in the morning			1
the only consolation , i suppose , is that i 'm far from alone			0
@entity20 , which is the second largest health insurer in the @entity45 , said on thursday that as many as 80 million customer records were stolen			1
the breach " ranks among the largest in corporate history , " writes @entity47			1
i do n't know about the other 79,999,999 of you , but it 's a strange feeling ( right ? ) to all of a sudden be part of a news story like this			1
we read about these data breaches all the time -- from @entity58 , @entity59 , @entity60			1
unless you 're connected to them personally , though , they tend to zip by , too numerous and massive to process			0
but when it 's your inbox , your data , something about it feels different			1
yeah , that 's selfish			1
but it was enough of a motivator for me to call up a couple data security experts to dig into this a little bit			1
my goal , like any vindictive jerk : figure out who to blame			1
the first , logical inclination , i figured , was to blame @entity20 , itself			1
should n't this company , with its orwellian emails , have done more with its " state - of - the - art information security system " to try to prevent an attack ? could n't it have implemented a super state - of - the - art system or something ? i found that view echoed by @entity90 , a senior instructor at the @entity91 , an information security training company			1
@entity90 told me he gets really annoyed when companies like @entity20 claim that they were the victims of a " very sophisticated " hack			1
most of the time , he said , they 're not sophisticated at all			0
the hackers " do n't need to be bigger - better - faster because we 're not doing the basics " to protect customer data , he said			2
" that 's the saddest part of all of this			2
the vast majority of these incidents could have been completely prevented if ( the companies who store data ) had been doing the basics			2
" aha ! villain identified ! column filed ! but , of course , it 's not quite so simple			2
even if you wanted to blame @entity20 , proving the company acted negligently in protecting data could be tricky			1
@entity90 told me the @entity117 could find that @entity20 failed to institute industry " best practices " -- as defined by the industry , he said -- and force them to pay a fine			1
( if medical records were stolen , and there 's no indication they were , then @entity122 laws governing medical records could be used to levy fines , too , he said			2
) another school of thought , however , holds that hackers always will be able to break into secure systems			0
i called someone with that point of view and @entity136 , a cyber security analyst at @entity138 , said she does n't think it 's fair to blame @entity20 for the stolen data			1
" they did the best they could , " she told me			0
" it 's amazing they caught ( the hack ) on their own			1
" @entity20 also did the right thing by alerting me and other customers , she said			1
that will make it harder for the hackers to sell and then exploit the data , at least right now , while people are watching			2
plus , she said , and this is the argument that worked best on me , blaming @entity20 does n't accomplish much for me the consumer			1
( remember : we care about me here			2
i 'm the one who got the email ... ) if your credit card data is stolen , she said , there are easy ways to rectify the situation			2
you call the bank and they refund the money , passing on costs to retailers			0
in the case of personal data breaches like this one , however , there 's essentially no one to blame			1
or no one -- no entity -- who can help you			0
" the government should really have some sort of agency where you just call up and you say , ' i had this bad thing happen ' -- and they 'll just fix it for you			0
and they 'll give you the money back , " she said			0
" it ai n't never gon na work like that , but that 's the way it should be			2
" meanwhile , she said , this is a very serious hack			2
if she were an @entity20 customer , the hackers have " my name , social , date of birth , address , " she explained			1
" to me , and i 'm a security expert , that 's worth more than a credit card			2
there 's all kind of damage that can happen ... someone could take over my @entity204 account			2
they could call the call center and take money out of my 401 ( k )			0
they could file a tax refund in my name			0
and all those things are really hard to recover from			0
" they could go out and create a fake driver 's license and commit a crime			2
they could take all that information and fake a birth certificate and go to the @entity220 ... " ok , we 've got it			0
so , back to the main question here : who to blame ? both security experts did share one answer : the @entity38 number itself			2
" we should simply publish everyone 's @entity38 number ( online ) so it ca n't be used , effectively , " by hackers , said @entity90			0
if that number loses its value , no one would want to steal it			0
@entity237 more or less agrees			0
" you need to make this data useless when it 's stolen , " she said			1
" that 's the answer			0
" i like this line of thinking			0
and @entity237 explained to me that there may be a way for health care companies , and other industries , to use a hard - to - crack proxy for a social security number in place of the real thing			1
if these companies never store our most - sensitive data in their records , then it 's of no use			1
she cited @entity259 's mobile payment system as a potential technological model			0
regulators should look to such technologies as they continue to figure out how to make consumer data safer			1
we 're helpless in this situation -- unable to understand exactly how and where our data is being stored			0
and unlike email and social media accounts , where stronger passwords and two - step verification systems help , there 's no way consumers can rework the it infrastructure of a major company like @entity20			1
we 're basically at their mercy			0
more needs to be done to protect us			0
whether that 's holding companies more accountable , as @entity90 suggests			0
or making this data worthless to criminals			0
otherwise , we 're left to end conversations with security experts like this			0
" good luck with your stolen identity ! " @entity237 told me			0
and then we hung up .			0

@entity290 tries to figure out who to blame for the @entity20 data breach
he was among the health care company 's customers who was notified about the hack
