-- as one of the stars of @entity5 's " @entity4 , " @entity1 had a solid fan base			1
his death monday in a motorcycle crash in @entity9 highlighted the love many have for @entity5 , which features plenty of " real estate porn " programming and likeable hosts who are popular among the @entity16 crowd			1
tributes to @entity1 very quickly appeared on the show 's @entity19 page and @entity21 after it was reported that the 38 - year - old had died when his motorcycle collided with a vehicle in @entity9 's @entity27 neighborhood			1
his brother , @entity28 , told @entity0 that his brother 's gig on the show was actually " the least interesting thing " about the @entity5 host			1
his brother loved adventure , he said			0
" he needed to chase experiences and embrace life in its raw form as often as possible , " his brother said			0
" and so that took a lot of different forms over the course of his life			0
" " a real loss - so sorry for his friends and family - the show is my favorite @entity5 show , " one commenter wrote on @entity19 , while another fan tweeted " @entity47 and now @entity1 who 's next			1
" with shows like " @entity56 , " " @entity57 " and " @entity4 , " the niche network appears to appeal to everyone , from those who love to rehab on the weekends to home dwellers dreaming big when it comes to their abodes			2
sometimes the participants themselves are enough to make viewers tune in			2
" yelling at the television during " @entity56 " has become almost a sport , " according to a recent @entity71 article			0
" you just ca n't help yourself			0
there 's couple after couple , making the same remarks , having the same debates and wearing the same casual garb from episode to episode			2
yet we still watch -- because we love it			0
" @entity1 was a carpenter on " @entity4 , " which offers homeowners a little makeover magic in order to help their houses make a better first impression			1
" the @entity5 family is deeply saddened by @entity1 's tragic death , and we mourn his loss along with his many family and friends who will miss his creativity , adventurous spirit and general love of life , " the show said in a statement wednesday			1
much like the @entity98 , @entity5 ( which stands for @entity99 ) has made stars of its hosts and has additional properties , such as @entity5 , which showcases its content			1
@entity104 , host of @entity5 's " @entity105 , " told @entity106 during a recent interview that " @entity5 is a wholesome network " that does n't " fabricate drama			1
" " [ the network 's ] bread and butter is people leaving it on all day , " he said			1
" you ca n't bring in much ridiculousness and maintain that type of audience			0
" the shows have a devoted following that hold the network to being above fabrication			1
in 2012 there was a slight uproar when a " @entity56 " participant , @entity126 , said the series made her and her husband pretend that they were still seeking out homes to buy , when really , the decision had already been made			0
on top of that , @entity126 said , some of the episode 's scenes were staged and shot multiple times			2
the show quickly responded , explaining that " we 're making a television show , so we manage certain production and time constraints , while honoring the home buying process			0
" " to maximize production time , we seek out families who are pretty far along in the process , " a publicist for the show told @entity144 in a statement			0
" often everything moves much more quickly than we can anticipate , so we go back and revisit some of the homes that the family has already seen , and we capture their authentic reactions			0
because the stakes in real estate are so high , these homeowners always find themselves right back in the moment , experiencing the same emotions and reactions to these properties			0
" despite it all , @entity126 told @entity144 she " loves @entity5			2
" @entity0 's @entity163 contributed to this report .			2

viewers offered *condolences* when host @entity1 died monday
another host says it 's a " wholesome network "
