@entity1 it should have been @entity3 's strongest moment as @entity5 governor -- a chance to showcase his style of executive leadership on the national stage			1
instead , the week turned into a calamity of @entity12 's own making			1
the leaked details of a bizarre proposal to create what sounded like a state government - run news agency sucked all the oxygen out of @entity5 's political media , right when @entity12 was supposed to explain a complicated conservative approach he 's taking to expanding @entity21			1
@entity12 immediately backtracked , but the damage was already done			1
it amounted to a very bad week for @entity12 at a time when other candidates took clear steps toward 2016 runs for the @entity28			1
after two years of complex negotiations , the @entity5 governor was poised to claim a major victory			1
the @entity32 who 'd once made his mark on @entity35 lambasting president @entity37 's health care law had struck a deal with the @entity28 to expand @entity21 , but on the governor 's terms			1
@entity12 would get to make a series of reforms to the program -- and if it worked , he could tout them nationally as a new conservative model			1
as opposed to walking tall , @entity12 suffered a public relations gaffe that upended the news cycle			1
his communications staff had made plans for a new website dubbed " just in			1
" as @entity12 says he understood it , the site would just be a clearing house for press releases and state reports			1
but an internal memo took the description much further , detailing the roles of a managing editor and an editorial board and indicating the site would publish feature stories and would sometimes break news ahead of independent journalists			2
the short - term embarrassment hurt @entity12 , but the longer - term cost could be greater : he lost his chance to explain his medicaid moves to conservatives who hate everything about @entity72			1
even if @entity12 can explain the mistake , the stumble has put more distance between him and what already would have been a dark - horse run in a crowded 2016 field			2
" if you 're going to get into a race , from today moving forward , it would have be to fill a void that exists , " said @entity79 , an @entity80 @entity79 strategist and the national campaign coordinator for the @entity82			1
" there 's really no one scrambling for a candidate that expands @entity21 and makes it harder to repeal @entity72			2
so it 's going to be very tricky			2
" the notion of a state government - run news agency was harmful enough , earning @entity12 headlines like " pravda on the @entity98 " and comparisons to @entity101 and @entity102 state media			2
@entity5 's @entity32 @entity28 speaker , @entity103 , even taunted @entity12 a bit , joking that he 'd ordered @entity105 in @entity107 and ending an interview by saying : " @entity108 ! " but there was another big problem : @entity12 really needed the oxygen those stories sucked up to explain his @entity21 expansion			2
after all , he was joining @entity115 gov. @entity114 and @entity117 gov. @entity116 on the list of potential 2016 candidates who broke ranks with other conservatives who 'd rejected @entity72 outright			2
and while those governors had argued the money was just too much to pass up , @entity12 's claim was bigger : he 'd found the conservative solutions to @entity21 's woes			0
it 's a tough sell to his party 's base -- and as soon as @entity12 announced the expansion , conservatives started piling on			0
@entity132 , the @entity133 - backed @entity135 's @entity5 director and typically among @entity12 's biggest allies , said that " the price of reforming traditional @entity21 should not come at the cost of expanding an already troubled entitlement program			0
" " myopic @entity32 governors think they can fool conservatives by gaining token concessions on what remains a government - run healthcare program and calling it ' free market reform , ' " wrote the @entity141 's @entity140			0
" this major betrayal should have consequences if he decides to run as president , " wrote the @entity150 's conservative thinker @entity149 for the @entity151			0
this is n't the first time conservatives who loved @entity12 - the - congressman have felt double - crossed by @entity12 - the - governor			0
shortly after being elected in 2012 , he decided to scrap the state 's involvement in @entity161			0
but the standards his administration proposed to replace them were almost identical			0
they were more of a rebranding , many conservatives complained -- just slapping a new name onto what @entity12 himself had called a bad idea			0
@entity12 has n't ruled out a run for president , saying he 'll make a decision after @entity5 's state legislative session wraps at the end of april -- and he still has his supporters			0
his pollster , @entity177 , said that while some candidates might not be able to do much to portray likely @entity181 nominee @entity180 as inaccessible , rich and out of touch , someone like @entity12 could be a " lesser - known but better foil for a @entity185 candidacy than a true @entity186			0
" @entity187 , an @entity117 media consultant who 's aligned with sen. @entity188 ( @entity189			0
) for 2016 but worked on @entity12 's 2012 governor 's race , touted @entity12 as a strong vice presidential choice , too -- saying his 12 years in @entity193 and four as an executive are the perfect combination			0
" he 's somebody who speaks to the heart of people , and has a leadership quality and a charisma that would be an incredible asset to anybody who was the nominee , " @entity187 said .			0

medicaid policy could have helped @entity3 build a national brand
but missteps took attention away from the policy
