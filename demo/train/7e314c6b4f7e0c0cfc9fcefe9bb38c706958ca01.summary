seriously endowed , dirndl - straining blonde waitresses at risk of a major wardrobe malfunction ferry armloads of steins from table to table in a sloshy blur			0
@entity9 , thigh - slapping hunks in clingy lederhosen , pound down torrents of weizen beer			0
teutonic endorphins are on parade			0
this could only be summer in @entity15			2
look at any beer ad or wander into any beer garden and you 'll realize that @entity19 absolutely revel in the traditional cliches about beer and go to great lengths to live up to them			2
a quiet sensation hidden behind monastery walls , she 's been turning water into beer at @entity29 , a 12th - century abbey in the @entity15 highlands , for more than 40 years			1
she 's a certified master brewer			0
she 's also a @entity32 nun			1
the local beer culture notwithstanding , @entity24 is living proof that women are destined for a higher calling than simply serving beer and starring in @entity39 's retrograde beer ads. @entity39 's beer scene is seriously dude - centric			1
and @entity15 's is even more so			1
the regional trade association does n't have a single woman in its ranks			0
10 of @entity46 's best beer bars ' ladies who lager ' only a small handful of women brew beer in @entity15			1
and the notion that " women do n't like beer " still holds sway			2
which is why @entity24 is so important			2
she 's one of a tiny group of " ladies who lager " -- female brewmasters who are charting their own course and debunking stereotypes about women and beer			1
like many monasteries back in the day , @entity62 became a magnet for pilgrims seeking blessings from saints ' relics on display in the abbey church			0
with droves of visitors in need of sustenance and an iffy water supply from pathogen - laden streams and wells , beer was one of the few drinks that was safe in the @entity81			0
this is why beer - making gradually became an important sideline at monasteries throughout @entity86			1
it flourished at @entity29 , as well , but was sidelined by the growth of secular breweries and not revived until 1881 , when the current brew house was built			0
what sets @entity29 apart from the handful of other surviving abbey breweries is that @entity24 is the only remaining nun brewmaster -- in all of @entity86			1
on brewing day , she 's excused from morning prayers and makes her way to the abbey brew house by 3:30 a.m. depending on the season , she can be found crafting a copper - toned vollbier ( lager ) , a dark zoigl , a contemplative doppelbock or spritzy maibock			1
it 's the stuff of gods			0
she gives a thumbs down to @entity15 's favorite weizen beer and does n't bother to brew it			1
in @entity15 , this borders on apostasy			2
sister @entity24 does n't care -- she 's a woman of decided tastes and firm opinions			1
' women 's work ' catholic nuns , by tradition , are destined for a life of prayer and service from the moment they enter the convent			1
in what must be the most unusual career move ever made by a nun , when @entity24 took the veil she became a brewmaster instead , succeeding the elderly @entity32 sister who had been operating the abbey brewery since the 1930s			1
" she looked me up and down like a farmer eyes an ox , " @entity24 tells a visitor about her selection process			2
sister @entity24 got the job			1
fresh out of training , master brewer 's certificate in hand , she took over the brewery in 1975			0
" beer brewing is women 's work , " she says , adding that female brewers were common in the @entity81			1
she 's proud that northern @entity15 has the largest number of female brewers in @entity39			2
among them are @entity146 and @entity147 and the @entity149 sisters , who are rocking the @entity15 beer scene with a new line of craft brews			1
as any lover of artisanal beer will point out , there 's an inverse relationship between size and quality			2
stated simply : the bigger the brewery , the less interesting the beer			0
or to put it the other way around : the smaller the brewery and the closer the brewer is to the brewing process , the more flavorful the beer is likely to be			2
sister @entity24 proves this maxim			1
@entity29 operates in splendid isolation , far from brewing hubs like @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173			0
measured by volume , scale , efficiency , size of ad budget ( zero ) or any other metric , the abbey brewery is 100 % old school			0
just how far under the radar it operates becomes clear when you realize that @entity24 brews only 3,000 hectoliters ( just under 80,000 gallons ) a year			2
to say that this is infinitesimal by industry standards is an understatement			0
global giants @entity189 and @entity191 / @entity190 turn out the same amount of beer every eight minutes			0
there 's a catch though			0
not only is @entity197 's beer -- luscious as it is -- not exported			1
it 's available only in the nooks and crannies of eastern @entity15			2
@entity201 with an iconic brewmaster like @entity24 and exceptional beers that are loaded with character , @entity29 could grow			2
the @entity32 , however , are apparently not inclined to expand or leverage the beer 's local following into something bigger			1
it seems they have no ambitions beyond selling their beer " um den @entity212 " -- around the proverbial church tower			0
this means beer lovers in the @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 and other countries experiencing the craft beer revolution wo n't be tasting @entity24 's beer locally anytime soon			1
drinkers need to travel to @entity39 , but even then , they may not have an easy go of it			0
the tourist infrastructure in the immediate area is n't well developed			0
the brewery does n't have a website or its own telephone number			0
and , while pilgrimages to the abbey and @entity235 in the nearby village of @entity237 are encouraged , tours of the brewery are n't offered			0
those who do make it to eastern @entity15 and @entity62 can sample @entity24 's brews at the abbey tap ( klosterbraustuberl ) , run by @entity242 ( @entity243 1 , @entity29 ; +49 772 915470 )			1
the concept of " marketing " would likely fall under its own weight if anybody ever tried to interest the @entity32 sisters of @entity29 in it			0
sister @entity24 carries the brewery on the strength of her reputation , the fiercely loyal following she enjoys and the breakout quality of the beer she brews			1
@entity62 has a " brand " and her name is @entity24 .			0

@entity32 nun @entity24 is one of only a handful of women working in @entity15 's beer industry
sister @entity24 is excused from morning prayers so she can get an early start on her daily brewing routines
she 's reckoned to be the last in a long line of nuns engaged in traditional beer making in @entity86
