@entity0 in @entity2 are looking for whomever abandoned a mixed - breed dog outside a railway station , along with a suitcase containing his food and other belongings			1
the @entity2 @entity10 is appealing for information on @entity12 after the male shar - pei crossbreed was discovered friday night , tied to a railing outside the @entity16 train station			1
beside him was a suitcase with some of the dog 's belongings , including a pillow , toy , a bowl and food			1
heart - tugging photos of the forlorn dog attracted thousands of shares and sympathetic comments on social media , with many people condemning his former owner			1
" poor lad , what a thing to do to him , " wrote one woman on @entity12			2
" i hope his future is brighter			0
" @entity10 inspector @entity38 said the dog is microchipped , allowing authorities to find out his name : @entity42			2
the @entity10 contacted the owner registered to the microchip , who said they had sold @entity42 online in 2013 but did not know the address of the person who bought him			0
" this case highlights the potential consequences of selling an animal online as it often leads to the impulse buying of pets that people know very little about , " @entity38 said in a post on the @entity10 's website			0
" regardless of the fact @entity42 was left with his belongings , this was still a cruel incident and we are keen to identify the person responsible			2
if anyone can help we would ask them to get in touch as soon as possible			0
" a woman from @entity66 , @entity2 , told the @entity67 on friday that the dog 's abandonment was the result of an attempted sale gone wrong			1
the woman said she responded to an online ad and agreed to buy the dog for about $ 600 but changed her mind once she arrived at the @entity16 train station to meet the seller			1

the seller then took off in his car , leaving the pooch , she said			0
the woman said she considered taking the dog home but panicked and left him tied to the railing because she had to catch the last train to @entity91 with her daughter , who suffers from asthma			1
meanwhile , the @entity10 has been flooded with requests from people wanting to adopt the dog			0
@entity38 of the @entity10 said @entity42 is about two to three years old and is " a lovely dog with a nice nature			0
we will look after him until we can find him a permanent and loving home			0
" some people noted that @entity42 's plight echoes that of @entity104 , the fictional bear in a series of popular kids ' books , who was adopted by a family after they found him sitting on his suitcase at @entity112 in @entity113			2
abandoning an animal is an offense under @entity2 's @entity116 , and anyone found guilty of doing so can expect to be banned from keeping animals for a fixed period or even life .			1
