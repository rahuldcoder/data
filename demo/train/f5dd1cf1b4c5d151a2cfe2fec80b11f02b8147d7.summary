-- the @entity2 epidemic now raging across three countries in @entity4 is three-fold larger than any other outbreak ever recorded for this terrible disease ; the only one to have occurred in urban areas and to cross national borders ; and officially urgent and serious			1
at least 1,090 people have contracted the awful disease this year , though the epidemic 's true scope is unknown because of widespread opposition to health authorities in afflicted @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18			1
this week , 39 - year - old physician sheik @entity19 -- labeled the country 's hero for his brave leadership of the epidemic fight -- died from @entity2 , adding yet another public fear : that even the doctors can not escape the disease			1
but as terrifying as @entity2 is , the virus has been controlled in the past , and can be again			1
the current crisis , which threatens an 11 - nation region of @entity4 that includes the continent 's giant , @entity32 , is not a biological or medical one so much as it is political			0
the three nations in @entity2 's thrall need technical support from outsiders but will not succeed in stopping the virus until each nation 's leaders embrace effective governance			1
as was the case in @entity45 , @entity46 , in 1995 -- an @entity2 outbreak i personally was in as a journalist -- there is no vaccine or cure for the disease			1
the key to stopping its spread is rapid identification of the sick ; removal of the ailing and deceased from their homes ; and quarantine and high hygiene measures to prevent transmission of the virus to family members and health care workers			1
in the absence of such measures , @entity2 will kill upwards of 70 % of those it infects , as the virus punches holes in veins , causing massive internal hemorrhaging and bleeding from the eyes , ears , mouth and all other orifices			1
@entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 are among the poorest , least governed states in the world			1
about half of the nations ' adults are illiterate			0
the 11.75 million people of @entity16 have a per capita annual income of merely $ 527 , and their combined male / female life expectancy is 58 years			1
in 2011 , the government of president @entity88 spent $ 7 on average per capita on health			2
life is no better for the 4.2 million people living in neighboring @entity17 , where per capita income is $ 454 , life expectancy is 62 years and the government of president @entity96 spends $ 18 per capita on health			1
in @entity18 , the 6 million residents have a per capita income of $ 809 per year , life expectancy is merely 46 years , and the government of the president , dr. @entity103 , spent $ 13 per capita last year on health			1
since @entity2 first broke out in march in @entity16 , fear has gripped the region , coupled with suspicion and wild rumors			1
some have proclaimed the epidemic " divine retribution " for past sins			0
in april , @entity16 health officials failed to quarantine an @entity2 patient who reportedly spread the virus from a remote area to the capital -- a lapse that undermined government credibility			1
in april , a mob claiming that foreigners were spreading diseases attacked a @entity123 clinic in rural guinea and forced the @entity126 - winning group to abandon its mission			0
the charity returned only after it had negotiated its safety with local religious leaders			0
in the capital city of @entity133 , families have been hiding their ailing relatives			0
even the local @entity135 was forced to abandon a part of the country after men brandishing knives surrounded them			0
and in one district , police fired tear gas at a mob that was trying to raid the morgue in order to give their loved ones proper burials , despite the risk of contagion			0
as the epidemic spread to @entity18 in may , brought in by a traditional healer who tended to ailing @entity16 and then returned home , similar problems surfaced			1
family members defied a local quarantine , thereby spreading infection			0
by the end of may , authorities were losing track of @entity2 sufferers amid widespread fleeing from health facilities ; the toll of missing patients approached 60 by june			1
some local leaders spread rumors that " the white people " were conducting experiments , infecting @entity18 or cutting off people 's limbs			1
@entity123 warned that widespread belief that @entity2 does not exist threatened to spread the disease regionally			2
today the word " @entity2 " carries so much stigma that few ailing individuals even seek diagnosis			2
by the end of june , the epidemic was exploding in @entity17 , fueled by the same sorts of denial and wild rumors that were rampant in @entity18 and @entity16			1
in one county , men with weapons chased off government health workers			0
today , the @entity188 is officially loath to say so , but under these circumstances , this epidemic is beyond anybody 's control			0
nobody , in any culture , relishes having their ailing loved ones removed from a family 's care , or their bodies hauled off to ignominious mass graves			0
but the violent reaction to such measures in @entity4 is far more extreme than anything that has occurred in other @entity2 crises since the virus 's first appearance in @entity46 in 1976			2
this should come as no surprise to anybody with a modicum of knowledge of recent history			0
the nations of @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 have a shared , brutal history of civil wars that since 1989 have left more than 400,000 people dead , displaced half a million people from their traditional homes , seen rape used as a weapon against tens of thousands of girls and women , and put @entity17 's former president behind bars as a war criminal			1
one of the most heinous features of the 1989 - to - 2005 wars was public amputation , typically carried out by child soldiers			0
the violence began in 1980 when @entity231 killed president @entity232 and then tyrannized @entity17 for a decade , growing rich off its diamond trade			2
in 1990 , rebels invaded the country from @entity236 , captured @entity231 , tortured him , dragged him naked through the streets of @entity238 , and then executed him			0
@entity239 took over the nation , running it until 2003			0
@entity239 , in turn , helped his comrade @entity242 seize control of @entity18 , and they systematically exploited their nations ' mines , leading to the @entity248 term " blood diamonds			2
" what you need to know about the deadliest ever outbreak with help from @entity16 , a second civil war started in 1999 in @entity17 , eventually engaging multiple warring factions , each more brutal than the other			1
it spilled over into @entity18 and was egged on by military elements in @entity32			2
by 2000 , all three of the now - @entity2 - torn countries were embroiled			2
@entity239 fled into exile in @entity32 in 2003 , and both he and @entity242 faced @entity248 war crimes trials			0
@entity242 died of a heart attack before his trial ; @entity239 is now imprisoned			0
in these three nations , few families have not experienced murders , rapes , torture , maiming , loss of homes and death			0
@entity274 , suspicion , poverty , pain and superstition are the norm , the noise that everybody lives with , every minute of their lives			0
@entity2 is simply a new scream heard above that terrible background din			2
the challenge today in these barely functioning states is to find ways to lower the overall noise , focus on stopping the ebola virus , and bring governance and peace to three countries that have rarely experienced either .			2

@entity292 : ebola epidemic in @entity18 , @entity16 , @entity17 worst ever , could be controlled
she says poor governance , ignorance , *hysteria* have stoked opposition to health care
she says key doctor in @entity2 fight now stricken , adding new fear that no one can escape
@entity306 : lacking governance , desperately poor citizens superstitious , avoid treatment
