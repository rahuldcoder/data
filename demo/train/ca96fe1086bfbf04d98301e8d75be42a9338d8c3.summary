@entity0 -- @entity3 's parole board heard a last - minute appeal monday by @entity5 , who is set to die by lethal injection for the murder 22 years ago of a @entity9 police officer			1
members of victim @entity12 's family also appeared at the parole board hearing to describe their loss , saying afterward they felt the panel listened to what they had to say			1
a jury convicted @entity5 of murder in 1991 , paving the way for his execution , which has been delayed three times and is now scheduled for 7 p.m. wednesday at a state prison in @entity23 , @entity3			1
in a statement , the @entity24 said it would not reach a decision in the case until tuesday at the earliest			0
options for the board include commuting a death sentence to either life without parole or life with the possibility of parole , or denying clemency -- which , in this case , would clear the way for @entity5 ' execution			1
the panel also can delay the execution to continue its consideration of the case			0
@entity12 , a police officer , died in 1989 after being shot three times			1
since @entity5 ' 1991 conviction , seven of the nine witnesses against him have recanted or contradicted their testimony			1
there also have been questions about the physical evidence -- and , according to some , the lack thereof -- linking @entity5 to the killing			1
" we believe that we 've established substantial doubt in this case , " said @entity52 , the defense attorney for @entity5			1
" and given the level of doubt that exists in this case , we believe that an execution is simply not appropriate			0
" a small group of @entity5 ' supporters protested outside the building where monday 's meeting took place			1
a banner saying " free @entity5 now " was hung nearby , and several protesters carried signs			1
on sunday , @entity67 , the @entity68 and @entity69 for @entity70 asked people to join them monday for prayers , musical performances and speeches outside the building			0
according to these groups , there have been about 300 rallies , vigils and events worldwide in the past week or so			0
in addition , they say that more than 1 million people have signed a petition in support of @entity5 ' bid to be exonerated			2
but @entity87 , the victim 's widow , said after the hearing that those protesting against the execution do n't understand the facts of the case			1
" we have lived this for 22 years			0
we know what the truth is , " she told reporters			0
" and for someone to ludicrously say that he is a victim -- we are victims			2
we have put up with this stuff for 22 years			0
it 's time for justice			2
" in a 2008 statement , then - @entity106 district attorney @entity105 described how @entity5 was at a pool party in @entity9 when he shot another man , @entity109 , wounding him in the face			1
@entity5 was then driven to a nearby convenience store , where he pistol - whipped a homeless man , @entity112 , who 'd just bought a beer			2
soon thereafter , prosecutors said , @entity12 -- who was working in uniform , off - duty , at a nearby bus station and restaurant -- arrived			2
it was then , the jury determined , that @entity5 shot the officer three times , including once in the face as he stood over him			1
@entity5 ' lawyers , in a federal court filing , insisted that there is " no physical evidence linking " @entity5 to @entity12 's murder			1
they point , too , to " the unremarkable conclusion " of a ballistics expert who testified that he could not find definitively that the bullets that wounded @entity109 and killed @entity12 were the same			2
@entity3 's attorney general , in an online statement , claimed that the expert said the bullets came from the same gun type and noted that casings at the pool party shooting matched -- thus came from the same firearm as -- those found at @entity12 's murder scene			1
two decades ago , a jury convicted @entity5 on two counts of aggravated assault and one each of possessing a firearm during a crime , obstructing a law enforcement officer and murder			1
the latter charge led , soon thereafter , to his death sentence			0
while reviewing @entity5 ' claims of innocence last year , the @entity152 for the @entity153 found that @entity5 " vastly overstates the value of his evidence of innocence			2
" " some of the evidence is not credible and would be disregarded by a reasonable juror , " judge @entity160 wrote in a 172 - page opinion			0
" other evidence that mr. @entity5 brought forward is too general to provide anything more than smoke and mirrors			2
" the odds do not appear to be in @entity5 ' favor			2
the parole board denied him clemency once before			1
and the board has never changed its mind on any case in the past 33 years			0
after monday 's hearing , the victim 's mother , @entity174 , praised the parole board members for listening to what her family had to say			1
" they talked to us			0
they gave us time that we did not get all of the time , " she said in reference to previous hearings			0
" sometimes we were rushed out of there in 30 minutes and we felt really rejected , you know , hurtful			0
this time , i think , was really , really good			0
that sounds awful , but that 's the way i feel			0
" choking back tears , @entity12 's daughter , @entity191 , said she told the panel that " the future that we would have had together was taken from us			1
the future he could have had with this family was taken			0
" meanwhile , the rev. @entity198 , who also testified monday , said before the hearing that he believes " there is too much doubt in this case for an execution			0
" " i have met with ( @entity5 ) on death row , " @entity198 said			2
" i believe he is innocent			0
" -- @entity1 's @entity205 contributed to this report .			0
