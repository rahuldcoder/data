-- amid a high alert over an alleged @entity4 plot to attack cities in @entity6 , @entity1 has warned its citizens about travel to the @entity9 , saying @entity9 authorities believe a terror attack is " highly likely			1
" the move follows a @entity13 warning that @entity13 be careful about traveling in @entity6 because of the risk of terror attacks			1
neither the @entity9 nor @entity1 raised threat levels in response to the @entity13 warning , but each has now warned its citizens about travel elsewhere on the continent			1
@entity6 remains on edge after the warnings , based at least partly on intelligence about a plot obtained from a @entity26 - @entity25 in @entity13 custody in @entity25			1
police in @entity1 seized 12 people for suspected terrorist ties tuesday , but it is not clear whether they are connected to the plot that prompted the warning			1
those arrests came a day after a suspected drone strike in @entity36 left five @entity26 nationals dead , adding to the unease			1
@entity1 national police said the 12 suspects were seized in the south of @entity1			1
three have links to a @entity1 man -- identified as @entity45 -- arrested in @entity46 last month , authorities said			1
two of them were arrested in @entity49 and the third was arrested in @entity51			0
the nine other arrests happened throughout southern @entity1 , including some in @entity49 and at least one in @entity54 , police said			1
police in @entity49 said the nine have links to an @entity59 movement and are suspected of trying to obtain arms and explosives			0
it is unclear whether the 12 are @entity1 citizens			2
none of them has been charged			0
under @entity1 law , police can detain and question suspects for up to six days without filing charges			2
meanwhile , @entity46 police said sunday they detained a @entity1 citizen of @entity73 origin who is suspected of being a member of @entity4			2
the man was arrested last month by @entity46 police in @entity77 , @entity46 , on a @entity6 arrest warrant requested by @entity1 , the chief prosecutor in @entity77 told @entity0 monday			1
the arrest was not announced at the time			0
@entity82 of @entity1 's @entity84 appeals court identified the man as @entity45 and said an anti-terror judge in @entity86 had requested his arrest and asked that he be extradited from @entity46			2
elsewhere , @entity36 intelligence confirmed that five @entity26 nationals were killed in a suspected @entity13 drone strike monday in the northwestern part of the country			1
the @entity26 were among 11 suspected militants killed monday in the @entity95 area of @entity96 , one of the seven districts of @entity36 's tribal region -- a remote and rugged area where militants hold sway			2

the news of the arrests in @entity1 and the @entity26 ' deaths in @entity36 come amid warnings from the @entity13 , @entity9 , @entity118 and @entity119 advising their citizens traveling abroad about potential terrorist attacks in @entity6			1
it is not known if tuesday 's arrests and monday 's drone strike , however , are related to the latest alerts			2
the @entity13 @entity126 and the @entity127 issued a joint bulletin sunday warning of the potential attacks			2
the reported plot prompted the @entity132 to issue a @entity6 - wide security advisory for @entity13 traveling abroad			1
the alert did not cite specific countries because the information about the threat was not specific enough to do so , a @entity132 spokesman said monday			0
jihadists from the @entity26 city of @entity142 are alleged to be at the heart of the suspected plots , @entity6 intelligence officials said			1
western intelligence officials say they learned about the potential attacks after @entity147 , a @entity26 citizen of @entity25 descent , was arrested in @entity25 in july and taken to the @entity13 air base at @entity150 for questioning			1
he has not been charged , and intelligence sources in @entity26 said he was cooperating with the investigation			2
according to @entity26 intelligence officials , @entity147 and 10 others left @entity142 in 2009 for the tribal areas of @entity36 -- where most of the group joined a jihadist group fighting @entity13 and coalition forces across the border in @entity25			1
@entity147 told @entity13 interrogators that at least one member of his travel group was to be a " foot soldier " in the plot , with other members of the group helping to plan the attacks , a @entity6 counterterrorism official told @entity0			1
@entity147 's father , @entity169 , said his son was on his way to the @entity26 embassy in the @entity25 capital to get a new passport when he was detained			1
@entity147 's father says he does not believe the allegations that his son is at the heart of an @entity4 conspiracy			0
" my son is not a killer , he 's just not capable of that , " he told @entity0 , stressing that such acts are absolutely forbidden in @entity180			0
@entity147 's sister says she , too , is shocked by the reports			0
according to @entity147 's sister , her brother left @entity142 last year to start a new life in @entity25 with his wife , an @entity189 citizen			2
she says that financial problems in @entity142 , including difficulty paying his rent , contributed to his decision to leave			0
" he had some debts and he was determined to earn money in @entity25 to repay them , " his father told @entity0			0
according to @entity26 intelligence agencies , @entity147 had a job cleaning aircraft at @entity202 before leaving for @entity36			2
@entity147 's father said he also did some work in @entity26 related to computers			0
before setting off , @entity147 told his family he was going to meet some friends in @entity36 and then go across from there to @entity25 , according to his sister			0
in later phone calls he would not reveal his location , according to his father			0
@entity147 's sister confirmed he had attended the @entity211 mosque in @entity142 , where several of the 9/11 conspirators met			0
