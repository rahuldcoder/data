-- what sounded like the most tragic of accidents -- a dad absentmindedly leaving his toddler in the car on a scorching @entity6 day -- is now being treated by police as a horrific crime			1
two new details were added to a revised @entity11 criminal warrant tuesday : not only did @entity12 put his son in the car minutes before arriving at work on june 18 , but he also returned to his car hours later during his lunch break			1
@entity12 placed his son , 22 - month - old @entity18 , into a rear - facing child restraint in the backseat of his @entity21 after eating breakfast at a fast - food restaurant			1
he then drove to his workplace , a @entity26 corporate office about a half - mile away , according to the warrant			1
read the criminal warrant ( @entity29 ) the 33 - year - old father returned to the car during his lunch break , opening the driver 's side door " to place an object into the vehicle , " the warrant states			1
later that afternoon , around 4:16 , @entity12 left his workplace near @entity38 , outside @entity39			1
within minutes , he pulled into a shopping center asking for assistance with the toddler , who had been in the car for about seven hours at that point , the warrant says			1
did @entity12 intend to kill his son ? besides felony murder , @entity12 was charged june 19 with first - degree child cruelty			1
on tuesday a magistrate judge downgraded the lesser charge to second - degree child cruelty			1
@entity50 , a @entity0 legal analyst , offered this interpretation of the downgrading of that charge wednesday on " @entity18 360			1
" " it 's almost a concession that they do n't believe , that the prosecutors do n't believe they 've got the evidence to say this is intended or premeditated , " he said			2
the second - degree warrant says @entity12 " did with criminal negligence causes ( sic ) a child under the age of 18 cruel or excessive physical or mental pain			1
" the earlier , first - degree child cruelty warrant said the crime occurs when a person " willfully deprives the child of necessary sustenance to the extent that the child 's health or well - being is jeopardized			1
... " " there 's a difference between negligence and gross negligence , " @entity75 spokesman @entity74 said at a press conference			0
" the thing about the negligence is that it could happen to anybody			0
the gross negligence shows that there 's some other circumstances revolving around this			0
" when a reporter directly asked if authorities think it 's malice or negligence , @entity74 said , " i honestly do n't have an answer for that question			0
" but in a seeming contradiction of the charge being downgraded , @entity11 police chief @entity99 said wednesday in a press release , " the chain of events that occurred in this case does not point toward simple negligence and evidence will be presented to support this allegation			1
" ' a distressed moment ' witness @entity104 told @entity0 affiliate @entity105 that an emotional @entity12 pulled into the shopping center after purportedly realizing he had forgotten to drop @entity18 off at day care at 8:30 a.m. the day care is reportedly located at the @entity26 office where @entity12 works			1
" laid his son on the ground , started doing cpr trying to resuscitate him			2
apparently the child was n't responding , " @entity104 told the station			2
police saw a crowd , and when officers began to investigate , they saw the child on the ground			2
once it became clear that @entity18 was dead , @entity12 had to be physically restrained , police said			1
" there were a number of witnesses -- passers - by in the area who observed basically the father in a very distressed moment , " said sgt. @entity124 of the @entity11 police			2
added @entity104 , " he kept saying , ' what have i done ? what have i done ? ' and that 's all that i could ascertain that he was saying			0
" medical examiner opinion police seemed sympathetic at first , and @entity124 told media that @entity12 apparently forgot the child was in the back of the vehicle while he was at work			1
the average temperature was about 80 degrees that day , but the mercury topped 92 at the hottest point in the day			0
police say the temperature was 88 degrees when the child was pronounced dead at the scene			2
the child 's cause of death was " consistent with hyperthermia and the investigative information suggests the manner of death is homicide , " the @entity147 's @entity146 said , according to a @entity11 @entity157 release issued wednesday			1
the release says the medical examiner 's office is waiting for toxicology test results before making an official ruling as to the cause and manner of the toddler 's death			2
' this could happen to anyone ' the story of the hapless father making an innocent mistake quickly changed as police released more details			0
" within moments of the first responders getting to the scene and doing their job and questions began to be asked about the moments that led up to their arrival at the scene , some of those answers were not making sense to the first responders , " @entity124 said last week			2
" i 've been in law enforcement for 34 years			0
what i know about this case shocks my conscience as a police officer , a father and a grandfather			0
" when @entity12 was charged with felony murder and child cruelty , there was vigorous debate over whether the heartbroken father should be punished			1
surely , he had suffered enough , many thought			0
a change.org petition was started urging authorities to release @entity12			1
that petition was withdrawn thursday , with this note explaining : " i think that based on the recent developments this petition is no longer relevant			0
i still pray that this was truly an accident			0
if that is the case , the da now knows that the community does not want @entity12 prosecuted on murder charges			1
" @entity39 area resident @entity211 started a second change.org petition asking prosecutors to drop the charges			1
it has garnered hundreds of signatures and was still operational as of 8:30 p.m. thursday			0
' a happy baby ' according to an obituary on legacy.com , @entity18 " was a happy baby			0
he loved to speak with anyone and made impacts on many people 's lives in his short time			0
" the toddler loved cars and trucks and would tell them goodbye as he left parking lots , the obituary said , adding that he had just learned the color red			2
" as we passed red vehicles he would tell his mommy and his daddy , ' bye red car , bye red truck			2
' he was a joy and will always be cherished , " it said			0
last week , @entity12 pleaded not guilty to felony murder and child cruelty charges			1
he 's being held without bond at the @entity241 and is scheduled to appear before a county judge july 3			0
@entity18 's mother , @entity243 , told @entity0 last week that she 's been advised not to discuss the case with the media			2
" we have been in communication with the mother throughout the investigation			0
at this time , i 'm not at liberty to discuss her involvement			0
that 's a part of the case our detectives are working on , " @entity124 said			0
repeated calls to the father 's attorney have not been returned , and a woman answering the phone at @entity262 's office said the lawyer would not be commenting at this time			2
@entity26 said through spokeswoman @entity264 that , per company policy , @entity12 is on a leave of absence without pay			1
" it is not appropriate to comment on any new developments in this active investigation			0
like the rest of our community , we 're deeply saddened by this tragic event and we continue to cooperate with authorities on their ongoing investigation , " she said in an e-mail			0
@entity280 ' funeral will be saturday at the @entity281 in @entity282 , @entity283			0
the service is open to the public			0
opinion : i , too , left my child in a hot car @entity0 's @entity290 , @entity291 , @entity292 and @entity293 contributed to this report .			1
