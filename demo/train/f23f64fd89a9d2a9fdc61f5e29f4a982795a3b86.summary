after the @entity4 cars canvassed the country in 2008 , initial privacy concerns were about license plates being shown in the photographs or people being shown in embarrassing situations , like entering adult bookstores			0

also in october , the @entity80 government said @entity4 broke the law by collecting the data , but it closed an investigation after calling it " a careless error			2
" in @entity86 , a commission that began investigating over the summer ruled that personal data had been collected			0
authorities cracked down , even pulling over @entity9 vehicles to make sure they had stopped collecting personal information			1
the @entity92 has banned @entity4 from expanding the service , and the news sparked an online privacy debate in @entity96 , where @entity4 is allowing people to opt out of @entity9 before the images go live			0
@entity34 , of the @entity24 , promised to keep a " close watch " on @entity4 's progress and follow up with an extensive audit			0
