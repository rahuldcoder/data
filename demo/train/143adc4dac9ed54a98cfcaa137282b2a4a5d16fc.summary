-- @entity1 has had her critics in the past			1
a defensive game and not landing a grand slam title while she was ranked no. 1 provided fodder for her detractors			1
but now everyone , it seems , is rooting for the @entity12			1
why ? well , much of it must be down to the fact that @entity1 was dumped -- and very publicly -- by golf sensation @entity15 only months before they were due to tie the knot			1
@entity15 ended the relationship in may , saying he was n't ready for marriage , and the news left @entity1 devastated			1
she was visibly distraught as she spoke to reporters at the @entity22 soon after , and exited in the first round , her earliest loss at @entity22 in seven years			0
the @entity25 has since rediscovered his vintage form , claiming he is more focused , and has won two major titles and regained his no. 1 ranking			1
@entity1 has also picked up her game after a lengthy slump			1
she 's the favorite to reach the @entity33 final from the bottom half of the draw after upsetting @entity36 on sunday			1
and whereas @entity1 said earlier in 2014 she would like to become a young mother -- suggesting her tennis days were numbered -- her own focus is now solely on the court			1
that @entity1 is prospering in @entity41 is slightly ironic -- it was where she was reportedly supposed to marry @entity15 in november			1
she 's sure to return to the @entity44 that month , however , having decided following their split to run in the @entity47			0
@entity1 has so far refused to discuss her relationship with @entity15 at the @entity33 , not that any of the fans minded			1
the crowd at @entity51 in her match against @entity36 was firmly behind the 24 - year - old , leading her to gush afterwards : " the crowd was amazing today			1
" her victory over @entity36 put @entity1 into a first grand slam quarterfinal since the @entity57			1
" the season for me has been a little bit up and down , " @entity1 said			1
" and it 's so nice to kind of start feeling like i 'm playing the way i want to			0
" this hard - court season has been amazing for me			0
i actually started already feeling really good on court since @entity63 ( in june )			0
i have just been building on my game since then			0
" @entity1 won a title in @entity66 in july and even though she did n't add to her haul in @entity68 and @entity69 , the player that stopped her was world no. 1 @entity1			1
both of their encounters went to three sets			0
they have become good friends this year , spending time together in @entity78 after their early departures from the @entity22			0
although @entity1 still ca n't be considered an attacking player , her serve has improved , and she has become more aggressive on the baseline			2
her retrieving , though , is still what gives opponents problems			0
making @entity36 keep running paid off , as the @entity86 committed 43 unforced errors			2
" i think she 's better at what she 's done really well in her career , " @entity36 said			2
" i think she 's moving extremely well ; she 's fit			0
" i mean , she 's always been fit , but there is a little bit more on her defense shots			0
" it 's not just balls up in the air			0
she 's doing a little bit more with them			0
" @entity1 faces another counter puncher , @entity99 , in the last eight on tuesday , and could face @entity1 -- again -- in the final			1
@entity1 advanced to the quarterfinals monday by beating @entity104 's @entity103 6 - 3 6 - 3			1
" i have had a great summer , and i told @entity1 i 'm pretty tired of her , " said @entity1			2
" i said , ' can you just get out of my way ? ' " we just laugh about it			0
this one was a great win for me			0
@entity36 , again , is a good player			2
for me , i think mentally as well to get that in my pocket is kind of nice			0
" i still have hopefully a few good matches in me here in this tournament			0
" @entity117 continues @entity119 success @entity41 is also proving to be a happy hunting ground for @entity117 , a semifinalist last year			2
the @entity121 won the biggest title of her career in @entity125 , @entity126 in march but has done little to back that up since			2
however , the 11th seed is now one win away from matching that feat after topping @entity132 's @entity131 7 - 5 6 - 2 in early play monday to earn a place in the last eight			2
but to get any further the 32 - year - old will have to get past defending champion @entity1			2
the winner of that match will face either former world no. 1 @entity140 or @entity86 's @entity139			1
@entity140 , a beaten finalist in @entity41 the past two years but seeded 16th after a year of injury problems , came from behind to beat @entity143 's @entity142 4 - 6 6 - 4 6 - 4			2
@entity139 , the 17th seed , reached the last eight for the second year in a row after upsetting @entity148 's rising star @entity147 , winning 7 - 6 ( 7 - 2 ) 6 - 4 against the seventh seed			0
meanwhile , men 's no. 1 @entity150 beat @entity153 's @entity152 6 - 1 7 - 5 6 - 4 and will face @entity154 in the quarterfinals			1
eighth seed @entity154 , who beat @entity150 in the 2012 final to win his first grand slam title , brushed off @entity161 's world no. 10 @entity159 7 - 5 7 - 5 6 - 4			1
@entity164 10th seed @entity162 reached the second grand slam quarterfinal of his career after outlasting @entity148 's no. 5 @entity167 in a marathon match that ended at 2:26 a.m. local time -- equaling the latest finish in the tournament 's history			0
@entity162 triumphed 4 - 6 7 - 6 ( 7 - 4 ) 6 - 7 ( 6 - 8 ) 7 - 5 6 - 4 in four hours 19 minutes to earn a clash with third - ranked @entity175			0
the @entity177 champion , a semifinalist here last year , defeated @entity179 16th seed @entity180 7 - 5 4 - 6 7 - 6 ( 9 - 7 ) 6 - 2 .			0

@entity1 is winning matches as well as fans at the @entity33
the former world no. 1 had the crowd behind her as she upset @entity36
@entity1 is now picking up her game after being dumped by @entity15 in may
@entity12 will play @entity121 13th seed @entity99 in quarterfinals in @entity41
