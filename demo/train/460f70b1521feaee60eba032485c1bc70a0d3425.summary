@entity0 , @entity1 -- it has been ten years since my last visit to @entity1			1
i knew the place had changed			0
i did n't realize how much			0
for a decade , @entity1 was the most violent , hopeless , war - torn corner of @entity8			1
@entity8 's impoverished , conscript army had been locked in an ugly struggle with @entity1 insurgents that left the region 's capital , @entity0 , a smoking ruin			1
much of the civilian population was either homeless or had fled			0
meanwhile , even the most courageous reporters and human rights activists thought twice about sneaking into the republic			0
by the end of the 1990s , @entity1 gangs made a lucrative business out of kidnapping and ransom			1
the kidnappers became quite adept at chopping off hostage body parts on camera , to provide gruesome video incentive for swift payment			0
imagine my surprise , then , when @entity8 government minders pick us up at @entity1 's newly - constructed airport , and then send a busload of foreign journalists to sparkling downtown @entity0 without any armed escort			1
a decade ago , the only illumination in @entity0 would have come from tracer bullets and the campfires of traumatized residents whose homes had been destroyed			0
today , a giant , @entity46 - built mosque glows at the center of a park rigged with rows of retro - style street lamps			2
families wander around on sidewalks in the balmy air			0
there is not a single gunman or soldier in sight			0
for the next two days of this @entity59 - supervised junket , i strain to find signs of the bullet - holes and shrapnel scars that once seemed to pock - mark every piece of concrete in @entity1			1
instead , in @entity1 's second largest city of @entity67 , i find armies of workers -- including migrant laborers from @entity71 -- busily constructing high - rises and roads			1
@entity67 is getting an architectural face - lift			2
ten years ago , when i wandered off from a @entity8 military " embed " trip to @entity67 , @entity1 locals joked openly about how much i would be worth if they kidnapped me , prompting me to hustle back to my army escort			1
today , residents sing a very different tune			0
" we thought it would take 50 years to rebuild this town , " one @entity1 man wearing in a wide - brimmed black hat tells me			1
" it 's a miracle how quickly this has happened here ! " the @entity59 clearly spent untold billions of rubles rebuilding the most unruly of @entity8 republics			1
it also struck a deal several years ago with a brash former rebel fighter named @entity90			1
his @entity1 security forces began taking the lead in operations against the insurgents			1
today , @entity90 is the president of the @entity1			1
this fiercely loyal supporter of @entity8 prime minister @entity96 has adopted the bizarre habits one comes to expect from a @entity99 despot			1
@entity90 races around his fiefdom driving his own black suv , dressed in shiny track suits and baseball caps			0
his mansion , a half hour 's drive out of @entity0 , has its own horse race track , a show room full of antique guns and sabers , the @entity112 initials " @entity119 " carved into the building 's façade and a private zoo full of lions , tigers and other big , endangered wildcats			0
the roars of one of these animals echoes throughout the compound as we wait until well after midnight for a press conference with the @entity1 strongman			1
when @entity90 finally arrives , he makes an announcement of victory			0
" we are in the final stages of our struggle , " he says , and then goes on to claim there are only 187 fighters left in @entity1 's insurgent movement			1
most of them , he adds , are foreigners			0
but peace in @entity1 has come at a disturbing price			2
for some reason , critics of @entity90 and his security forces keep getting killed			2
last july , @entity141 , an activist with the human rights group @entity142 , was kidnapped in broad daylight in downtown @entity0 and later found dead with two bullets to the head			2
" this crime could n't have been committed without the participation of some law enforcement agencies , " says @entity146 , the @entity1 man who has assumed @entity141 's former position at @entity142			2
" certain forces in @entity1 reserve the right to kidnap , kill or torture whoever they want			2
" more recently , police in @entity156 linked one of @entity90 's top aides to the january 2009 shooting death in @entity160 of @entity161			0
the former @entity1 rebel served in @entity90 's security forces and later testified against @entity90 before the @entity164			1
moments after his murder , @entity156 police said one of the suspects called a cell phone in @entity1 believed to belong to one of @entity90 's right - hand men , @entity171			1
@entity171 visited @entity160 and met with the suspect a few months before the murder			0
@entity90 denied any links to the murder , while delivering a lengthy monologue			0
" i knew this guy [ @entity161 ] personally , " he said during the midnight press conference			0
" it would have been so stupid and so obvious to kill people in broad daylight			0
why would i do this ? did he kill any of my people ? if he did , maybe then i would have considered it			0
" the @entity59 now relies on @entity90 , along with the many potentially explosive skeletons in his closet , to guarantee peace and stability in @entity1			2
but while @entity1 has stabilized , the neighboring @entity8 regions of @entity191 and @entity192 have grown more violent then ever , with frequent car bombs and assassinations			1
@entity196 experts say the @entity1 nationalist movement that once challenged @entity198 has morphed into a broader @entity200 rebel movement that threatens to engulf the @entity8 @entity196			1
that violence seems worlds ' away from the brand - new ice skating rink that we visit in @entity0 one night			0
dance music throbs as young @entity1 men on ice skates crash into each other , laughing ; some of them hug the sideboards to avoid collapsing on the ice			2
it is a silly , wonderful sight to see in a city that had endured so many years of war and hopelessness			0
but how long can @entity90 's huge public works projects and scary security forces ensure stability , with so much trouble brewing nextdoor and unemployment still sky high within @entity1 ? the cliché that @entity1 is " skating on thin ice , " springs to mind -- especially after i notice that one of the @entity1 men , teetering comically on the ice , is skating with a pistol strapped to his belt .			2

@entity1 has seen construction surge in formerly war - torn areas
@entity237 president was rebel fighter
activist : critics of president have ended up dead
neighboring @entity8 regions have grown more violent
