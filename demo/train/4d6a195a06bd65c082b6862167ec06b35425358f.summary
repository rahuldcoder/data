the fate of disputed border areas are also a point of contention			0

" @entity165 also accused the leaders of @entity1 of continuing to act like guerrilla fighters instead of a new government			2
" it is high time for the @entity179 and the international community to send also a strong message for the government of the @entity1 to disassociate itself from the rebel factions and to stop destabilizing " @entity1 and the region , he said			2
@entity185 , which has invested heavily in @entity1 's oil industry , has argued for calm and respect for each other 's sovereignty , while @entity191 , the @entity192 special envoy for @entity1 and @entity1 , visited both countries recently to meet government officials			1
there is " an enormous amount of very emotional , very powerful rhetoric coming from here in @entity82 raising the stakes in many ways and that 's worrisome in and of itself , " @entity191 said thursday			0
