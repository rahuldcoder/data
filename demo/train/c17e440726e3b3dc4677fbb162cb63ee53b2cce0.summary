-- for all the heavy baggage that she carries , @entity1 is walking on water			1
ham - fisted attempts by the @entity5 to smear her brain have backfired horribly ( rightly so ; they were distasteful ) , while @entity5 efforts to hang @entity8 around her neck ( @entity12 chairman @entity11 tried this weekend ) have barely dented her popularity among @entity14			1
@entity15 calls her a " buddy " who would make a " very effective " president , and the former secretary of state remains clear front - runner for her party 's 2016 presidential nomination			1
in fact , right now , she 's the only real runner			2
and that ca n't be healthy -- for democracy , for the @entity14 or even for @entity27			1
how can we be sure she 's running ? well , the @entity30 might be the only country in the world where a politician signals his or her ambitions by writing a book			1
this does not , alas , mean that @entity30 's politicians are unusually literate			0
often , the book is bad ; usually , it 's ghostwritten ; only occasionally is it worth reading			0
but it 's generally a sign			0
the title of @entity1 's " @entity43 " -- out on june 9 and helpfully promoted by a series of interviews with tv 's biggest anchors -- suggests a woman who is trying to make sense of a troubled recent past			1
becoming @entity15 's secretary of state , @entity52 , @entity53 and the @entity8 fiasco were all arguably " choices " forced upon her			1
that they were " hard " implies an admission that the outcome was far from desirable			0
@entity27 is a potential presidential candidate who has to deal with not just one compromised record but two			1
first , the @entity27 administration ; second , the @entity15 administration			1
in both cases , she seems keen to remind us , she was n't technically in charge			0
such is the strange ambiguity of @entity1			1
first , she was the co-president and architect of @entity27 's most ambitious domestic reforms , the @entity68			2
then , she was the betrayed wife who did stand by her man			0
next the liberal senator , the presidential candidate of the overwhelming majority of the establishment , suddenly a primaries loser who had to reinvent herself as @entity72 , finally a loyal servant of the president , a man whose abilities she questioned so rudely in the nomination battle			0
like @entity80 before her , she is one of those politicians who is defined by longevity			0
her politics have changed so often that it 's hard to precisely define what @entity85 is anymore , but she has lasted so long in the spotlight that it 's become almost impossible to conceive that someday she wo n't be president			0
that 2016 is @entity27 's time is reflected in the surprising , even depressing , lack of an alternative			2
what is vice president @entity93 doing with his weekends ? or @entity98 mayor @entity97 ( who has ruled himself out , if you can believe that ) ? or @entity100 gov. @entity99 ? without them , who are we left with ? @entity105 gov. @entity104 , headed for @entity106 but probably not very well known there ? sen. @entity107 , sometimes pushed as the working - class @entity1 but who would probably be unelectable outside of @entity110 ? @entity111 , interestingly , has written a book , too			1
contrast this silence with the @entity5 side			2
the @entity5 is weighing up @entity116 sen. @entity115 , @entity118 sen. @entity117 , @entity120 gov. @entity119 , former @entity122 sen. @entity121 , @entity124 sen. @entity123 and former @entity116 gov. @entity125 ( whether they 've showed any interest in running or not ) , and this pre-contest contest gives the impression that all the action is on the right while the @entity14 just sit out what remains of @entity15 's second term , waiting for the whole thing to come to a dignified end			1
@entity135 : why i 'm ready for @entity1 and the @entity5 struggle is attractively philosophical			1
@entity117 represents the rise of libertarianism ; christie channels the spirit of mayor @entity142 ; @entity125 is our generation 's @entity143 ; @entity121 is running to build heaven on @entity147			0
these people are discussing ideas that will shape the future of the country			0
@entity27 is talking largely about herself			2
of course , two years is almost an eternity in politics , and things might change			0
at pretty much this point in the 2008 contest , @entity27 also commanded a lead over her opponents and looked set to win the nomination -- and we all know what happened come @entity106			2
she is a different kind of politician now , having built statesman status with her time as secretary of state			0
but headed into her second go at the nomination after over 20 years of dominating the national stage , it 's possible that many voters will simply decide that they want a change			0
is @entity30 really so locked in its partisan , elitist politics that would tolerate another @entity27 vs. @entity125 campaign ? those who think continuity is unhealthy in a democracy might judge not .			2

@entity181 : @entity1 *bashed* by @entity5 , *praised* by @entity15 and still front - runner
he says she has new book , top anchors interviewing her ; this usually signals candidacy
she must deal with two compromised records , with two administrations , he says
@entity181 : @entity5 weighing many candidates . dems *offering* one . do voters want another @entity27 ?
