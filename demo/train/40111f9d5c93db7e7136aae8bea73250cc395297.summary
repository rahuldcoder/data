-- as you can imagine , college life can be very eventful			1
balancing classes , internships , and a life away from home is enough to keep anyone busy			0
as a 20 - year - old living with a chronic illness , i have skillfully learned the balancing act of college life			1
my name is @entity14 , and i have sickle cell disease			1
i was first diagnosed at birth			0
the doctors performed a newborn screening test and when i was 10 days old they called to inform my mom			1
because she and my father both have the sickle cell trait , she was aware that i may have the disease			1
at the age of 8 months i began having fevers over 101 consistently for a year			1
when i was 5 years old , i was riding the new bike i had just gotten for @entity27 when i fell off and the handle bars hit me in the ribcage			0
that night i began having difficulty breathing			0
i was rushed to the local hospital and within hours i had stopped breathing			0
i was moved to intensive care , revived , and placed on a respirator			0
the critical care doctors and the hematologist worked day and night to figure out what was happening to me			0
my health continued to decline , and my parents were told to go pray because if i continued to not receive enough oxygen i would only have two hours to live			0
around the seventh day , my condition stabilized and it was learned that i was suffering from an acute chest syndrome , a condition common among sickle cell patients			1
shooting survivor says blood donations saved her life sickle cell disease is a genetic blood disorder affecting the red blood cells			1
it causes the cells to lose oxygen very easily , turning them from round shapes to crescent shapes that cause painful episodes known as pain crises			1
at first glance , no one would know that i am a patient living with sickle cell disease			1
on any given day i can feel great , but i never know when the pain will come or how long it will last			1
a pain crisis can cause severe pain in my joints , my bones and my muscles			1
sometimes it lasts for hours or even for days			0
at my worst it is difficult to walk and i have to use a wheelchair			0
to help reduce the number and severity of these episodes , i take daily medications and , with the help of the @entity76 , i receive red blood cell transfusions every six weeks			1
the first time i received donor blood from the @entity76 , i was in the 11th grade			2
i arrived on an outpatient basis , and a trained nurse from the @entity76 came to administer the procedure			0
i was nervous , but the possibility of having little to no pain was exciting			2
first , my blood was typed and cross-matched with donor blood			2
then , with my family by my side , the transfusion began			2
a machine filtered out my sickled red blood cells in exchange for roughly 10 pints of normal red blood cells			1
the @entity76 nurse administering the transfusion was very knowledgeable and friendly , which helped me remain calm			2
everything was a success , and within a week and a half i felt like a brand new person ! my bones no longer ached and i was able to stop taking the heavy pain medication			2
once my senior year began , i was able to attend school more often			2
i also was able to run the mile in eight minutes with the rest of the gym class -- and i was n't the last person to finish ! cancer survivor 's challenge : give the gift of life this season now in my junior year at @entity114 , i am still managing school work and my illness			2
i am involved in campus life as a member of student government and other organizations			2
i am young and full of life , with many goals and aspirations			0
the @entity76 provides the opportunity for me to feel better more often			0
transfusions allow me to have an easier , pain - free life			1
during this holiday season , my hope is that everyone will realize the importance of being a blood donor			0
for people like me who need regular transfusions , blood is often best matched among people of the same ethnic group , so donations from anyone who is a minority or has a rare blood type such as u- or @entity141 ( a-b - ) are especially important			1
you could help someone like me live a healthier , happier , pain - free life			1
i am a testament to the importance of blood donation and the services that the @entity76 provides on a daily basis			0
without both i would n't be able to be a happy and successful young lady			0
i realize that sickle cell disease is a part of me , but it will never define who i am			1
with treatments like this and a strong support system , which i have from my family and the @entity76 , there is no excuse not to succeed with this disease			0
