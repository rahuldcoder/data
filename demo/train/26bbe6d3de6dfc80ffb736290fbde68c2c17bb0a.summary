@entity0 -- @entity2 , the world 's most famous soccer team , fired manager @entity4 on tuesday , less than a year after hiring him to replace football legend sir @entity5			1
here 's a look some key numbers for the club under @entity4 : seventh place : @entity2 is on track for its lowest finish in @entity13 history			1
with four games to play , the team can not finish higher than fifth in the table			0
this will be the first time it has finished outside the top three since the @entity13 began in 1992			0
57 points : with 34 @entity13 games under his belt , @entity4 has won 17 , drawn 6 and lost 11			1
soccer commentators have been pointing out for months that @entity4 is actually doing slightly better than @entity5 did in his first season as manager , starting in 1986 , but @entity5 was taking over a 20th - place club on the way up			1
@entity4 took over the team that won the @entity13 last year			1
1.64 : average number of goals the team has scored per game this year , down from 2.27 last year			0
31,300,500 pounds : @entity2 will not qualify for @entity35 's top soccer competition , the @entity36 , next season			1
that 'll cost the team more than 31 million pounds ( $ 52.6 million ) , since it will lose the broadcast revenue it gets from being in the @entity36			1
two : the number of times @entity2 has n't been in the @entity36 , including next season			2
ten months : the length of @entity4 ' tenure as manager			2
@entity5 led the club for 27 years , but to be fair , in today 's @entity13 , 10 months is a much more common tenure than 27 years			1
six years : the length of @entity4 ' contract when he was hired last july			0
the @entity49 reported he 'll probably get a one - year payoff , not the full five years ' salary , because he failed to meet performance targets			2
under @entity55 stock market rules , the club will eventually have to reveal @entity4 ' terms			0
$ 19.18 : @entity2 's highest share price on the @entity58 in may last year			0
that 's the highest it 's been in the past year , and it plunged in the wake of the announcement of @entity4 as manager			2
it hit its lowest point , $ 14.26 , in february as the team suffered one defeat after another , but recovered to $ 17.72 by the time @entity4 was fired			2
1996 : the last time a defending @entity13 champion finished as low as @entity2 now ranks			0
( trivia buffs : it was @entity71 , who won the league in 1995 and finished seventh in 1996			0
) @entity1 's @entity74 , @entity75 , @entity76 , @entity77 and @entity78 contributed to this report .			0

@entity4 has been fired less than a year after taking the *job* of team manager
@entity2 is on track to its worst finish in @entity13 history
failing to qualify for @entity36 will cost club more than 30 million pounds
@entity4 lasted 10 months of a six - year contract
