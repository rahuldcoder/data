when he goes into his book bag , they pull a gun out			0
what was the purpose of a gun ? and now they ask me to open my door so i can get out			0
if you can pull out a gun in front of ... there is two kids in the back seat			2
" both the @entity143 and @entity13 are standing by the officers			2
" police officers who make legal traffic stops are allowed to ask passengers inside of a stopped vehicle for identification and to request that they exit a stopped vehicle for the officer 's safety without a requirement of reasonable suspicion , " @entity66 said			1
@entity13 mayor @entity154 cited two recent police officer deaths in @entity2 as the reason for heightened precautions			2

" @entity0 attempted to contact @entity64 and @entity62 , but was unsuccessful			0
using taser on an 8 - year - old ? @entity192 sues police , city who recorded the incident ? " that incident further magnifies what took place in @entity201 , the use of excess force that seems to be happening across the breath and width of this nation , " said @entity198 board member @entity197			1
" as a man of color , if i 'm pulled over , i will be leery of the officer and obey whatever commands they are giving me because at this point you are fearful of your life " it was fear that led one of the children in the back seat , @entity219 , 14 , to begin recording the incident			1
" the kids and the family had seen all the news of officers engaging in excessive force and were concerned for their safety , " family attorney @entity220 told @entity0 affiliate @entity221			2

the august fatal shooting of @entity260 in that city led to days of violent protests in @entity201			0
" just because the police could do it , does n't mean they should			0
my question here is the judgment that they used smashing that window with the kid in the car and four passengers in that car if there could have been another way to get around that , " said @entity0 law enforcement analyst , @entity265 the mayor said he acknowledged " the importance of being sensitive to differing points of views , amongst our diverse community , in regards to actions taken by our police department			0
" " as always , i will continue to encourage open dialogue on this and any issue that may affect relations between city government and members of our community , " he said			0
