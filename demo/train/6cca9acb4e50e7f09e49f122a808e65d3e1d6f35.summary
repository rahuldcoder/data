-- caffeinated alcoholic beverages such as @entity2 have come under fire from lawmakers and public health officials in recent weeks , following reports of hospitalizations and even some deaths tied to the potent drinks			0
now , a new study suggests that combining caffeine and alcohol can pose a risk to young people even when the substances are n't mixed in the same can or cup			2
college students who consume nonalcoholic energy drinks such as @entity19 at least once a week are more than twice as likely as their peers to show signs of alcohol dependence , including withdrawal symptoms and an inability to cut back on drinking , according to the study			1
@entity0 : do you have a drinking problem ? " the odds were fairly strong , especially when you look at the dose of energy drink used , " says the lead researcher , @entity28 , phd , director of the @entity29 at the @entity30 , in @entity31			2
the study , which appears in the journal @entity37 : @entity38 , was based on interviews with about 1,100 college seniors			0
the findings do not show cause and effect , and it 's unclear whether energy - drink consumption is directly linked to alcohol problems			1
for instance , students who spend a lot of time partying may simply be more likely to resort to energy drinks to help them pull all - nighters and cram for tests , the researchers say			1
on the other hand , energy - drink consumption could be a more immediate symptom of alcohol problems -- if a student often drinks @entity19 in the morning to shake off hangovers , say			1
@entity0 : being choosy about booze helps avoid hangover ( to a point ) another possibility is that energy drinks actively contribute to problem drinking			2
if mixed with alcohol -- a common practice among college students -- caffeine - laden energy drinks can prolong drinking sessions and mask the feeling of drunkenness , potentially raising the risk for dangerous binges and behavior			1
( this has been the main concern with caffeinated alcoholic beverages , including @entity2			0
) " caffeine keeps you awake but just as impaired , " @entity77 says			0
" you may feel as if you can get into a car or play a risky game			0
that 's why this feeling of wide awake drunkenness is more dangerous			0
" a similar dynamic can exacerbate alcohol problems over the long term , says @entity88 , @entity89 , a professor of psychology and public health at @entity92 , in @entity93			2
consuming energy drinks " masks the extent of the drinking in such a way that it can sneak up on people , " he says			2
" they do n't realize that they 're developing the problematic patterns that are characteristic of alcohol abuse and dependence			0
" @entity0 : can a bigger booze tax reduce disease , crime ? nearly two - thirds of the students in the study reported having an energy drink in the past year , and just over half said they consumed the drinks about once a month or less			2
about 10 percent of the students consumed the drinks weekly , and roughly 3 percent did so daily , or almost daily			0
@entity19 was the most popular drink			0
compared to those who consumed energy drinks rarely or not at all , students who consumed them at least once a week drank alcohol more frequently and in greater amounts , on average			1
they were also more likely to experience blackouts , skip class or other activities due to hangovers , be involved in a fraternity or sorority , and meet the criteria for alcohol dependence			0
the researchers took into account a number of other student characteristics , including sex , race , socioeconomic status , depression symptoms , and total alcohol consumption			0
factors such as depression were associated with alcohol problems , as expected , but energy - drink consumption was independently linked to alcohol dependence even after controlling for all risk factors			1
@entity0 : @entity148 , friends are big influence on drinking energy drinks -- which include brands such as @entity153 , @entity154 , and @entity155 , in addition to @entity19 ( by far the market leader ) -- generated about $ 5 billion in @entity159 sales in 2008 and have skyrocketed in popularity			1
although the economic downturn appears to have somewhat slowed their growth , sales of the beverages in the @entity159 increased by 136 percent between 2005 and 2009 , according to the market research firm @entity165			2
the @entity166 , a trade group that represents the makers and distributors of nonalcoholic beverages ( including @entity19 , @entity153 , @entity154 , and @entity155 ) , emphasized in a statement that the study did not prove a direct link between energy - drink consumption and alcohol problems			1
the findings " do not show that energy drinks encourage misuse of alcohol in any way and state that further research is warranted , " the association said			1
the association also said that the amount of caffeine in most energy drinks is comparable to that in 1 to 2 cups of coffee			1
( in the study , @entity77 and her colleagues did control for caffeine intake from sources other than energy drinks			1
) energy drinks contain anywhere from 50 to 500 milligrams of caffeine per can , but the caffeine content is largely unregulated and is n't required to be listed on the label , @entity77 says			1
@entity0 : 12 surprising sources of caffeine in 2009 , @entity77 joined a group of scientists in asking the @entity205 to review the safety of premixed caffeinated alcoholic drinks			0
although the new study did not look specifically at these products , the risk of alcohol dependence associated with drinks such as @entity2 may be even greater , @entity208 says			0
people with alcohol problems who are determined to mix caffeine and alcohol " do n't need help from the manufacturer , " he explains			1
" but for those who have n't developed a problem , the ease with which they can get drinks that have the combination in them makes it more likely they 're going to try these out in a way that can potentially have negative consequences			0
" the @entity205 is expected to make an announcement about caffeinated alcoholic beverages on wednesday , according to news reports			0
in a press release , senator @entity236 ( @entity237 -- @entity238 ) said tuesday that the @entity205 " will rule that caffeine is an unsafe food additive to alcohol beverages , " effectively banning the sale of the beverages in the @entity159 @entity245 2010			2

the amount of caffeine in most energy drinks is comparable to that in 1 to 2 cups of coffee
it 's unclear whether energy - drink consumption is directly linked to alcohol problems
energy drinks generated about $ 5 billion in @entity159 sales in 2008
