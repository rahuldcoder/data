the @entity0 blocked a measure tuesday that would have authorized construction of the @entity3 as @entity4 chose their pro-environment base over an old friend -- embattled @entity8 sen. @entity7			1
the vote could just be a speedbump for the @entity3 project , with @entity12 ready to try again -- with much better odds of success -- once they take control of the @entity0 in january			1
" this will be an early item on the agenda in the next @entity22 , " incoming senate majority leader @entity16 , @entity17 , said after tuesday night 's vote			1
but it 's a sharp blow to @entity7 , who had based much of her campaign for re-election in a december runoff on the argument that she could deliver results			1
for days she had insisted that she had the 60 supporters necessary to cross a key procedural threshold , only to fall one vote shy on tuesday night			2
" this is for @entity35 , for @entity35 jobs , to build an @entity35 middle class , and it will create 40,000 immediate jobs , " @entity7 said on the @entity0 floor ahead of the vote			1
" if the people of this @entity22 have n't noticed , there 's a long unemployment line in some parts of this country			1
" the vote served as a preview of the confrontations that lie ahead in @entity47			1
president @entity48 is on track to overhaul immigration rules on his own by the end of the year -- a move that is pushing some conservatives to consider shutting down the government in retaliation			2
and as soon as the new @entity12 @entity22 is sworn in next year , @entity3 will be back on the agenda , along with efforts to curtail @entity58 , raising the prospect of @entity48 issuing a series of vetoes			1
but for all the battles that lie ahead , tuesday 's vote was really about local politics			2
@entity8 's @entity0 race is headed for a dec. 6 runoff election , and @entity7 -- currently the @entity68 chairwoman -- saw the pipeline as a final chance to demonstrate her clout to voters in an energy - rich state			1
republicans responded by guaranteeing her opponent , rep. @entity75 , a seat on the energy committee			0
the @entity78 @entity12 also had him sponsor their own @entity3 authorization bill , which was approved friday on a 252 - 161 vote			1
@entity75 rubbed salt in @entity7 's wound tuesday , with his spokesman saying the vote was " perfect snapshot of her time as chair of the @entity89 -- a failure			1
" right now , the decision on whether to approve the @entity92 - to - @entity94 pipeline is in the hands of the @entity96			0
@entity48 has said repeatedly in recent days that he wants @entity22 to stay out of it and leave it to @entity98 to finish its review of -- among other factors -- whether the pipeline would contribute to carbon pollution the could cause climate change			1
" there is a process underway and the president is confident that that process will carefully evaluate the consequences of this specific proposal and that that 's the proper way for a decision like this to be made , " @entity78 press secretary @entity104 said tuesday			0
six years into that review , though , lawmakers have grown impatient			0
" this process has not worked			0
this process has not brought this project some sort of finality -- yes or no ? " @entity121 sen. @entity120 , one of the pipeline 's most outspoken @entity123 supporters , said on the @entity0 floor tuesday			2
@entity126 @entity4 like @entity128 's @entity127 railed against the pipeline tuesday , arguing that the environmental harm it could cause far outweighs the potential economic gains			0
@entity127 pointed to potential health risks of laying the pipeline , including heart disease , increased hospitalization , and a higher prevalence of chemicals that " penetrate deeply into the lungs			0
" " the facts are the facts are the facts , " she said			0
" if you 're not a scientist then be humble and listen to the peer - reviewed scientists			0
they do n't have a special interest			0
they have an interest in giving us information we should base our decisions upon			0
" @entity127 also referred to the project as the " @entity153			0
" the @entity3 debate on tuesday pitted traditional @entity123 allies against each other			2
many of the @entity123 no votes were longtime friends and supporters of @entity7 who had contributed tens of thousands to her campaign			2
@entity123 sens. @entity161 of @entity128 , @entity162 of @entity163 and @entity164 of @entity165 all contributed $ 7,000 or more to her campaign , and all opposed passage of the bill			2
in the lead - up to tuesday night 's vote , the big question was whether @entity7 could find the 60 supporters necessary to clear a key procedural threshold			1
in addition to the chamber 's 45 republicans , all of whom were expected to support the bill , @entity7 was joined by 10 more @entity123 co-sponsors : @entity180 sen. @entity179 , @entity182 sen. @entity181 , @entity184 sen. @entity183 , @entity186 sen. @entity185 , @entity188 sen. @entity187 , @entity188 sen. @entity189 , @entity191 sen. @entity190 , @entity121 sen. @entity120 , @entity193 sen. @entity192 and @entity193 sen. @entity194			1
three more @entity4 had pledged last week to support the measure : @entity197 sen. @entity196 , @entity163 sen. @entity198 and @entity200 sen. @entity199			0
that left her one vote short -- and her options looked limited			0
@entity193 @entity123 sen. @entity205 said monday night that he was a no vote			0
@entity208 sen. @entity207 , an independent who caucuses with the @entity4 , said tuesday that he would n't support it			0
" @entity22 is not -- nor should it be -- in the business of legislating the approval or disapproval of a construction project , " @entity207 said in a statement			2
after the vote , five @entity216 protestors in the @entity0 gallery interrupted with chants and cheers			1
they were removed by police -- and the @entity0 moved on without a speech that had been expected from @entity7 .			1
