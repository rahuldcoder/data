editor 's note : @entity2 is a professor of sociology at @entity4 and the author of 16 books , including the @entity8 bestseller , " april 4 , 1968 : @entity10 's death and how it changed @entity11 "			1
@entity2 says the arrest of @entity13 shows that the @entity11 is not " a post-racial paradise			1
" ( @entity15 ) -- last thursday , president @entity19 , in his fiery speech before the @entity18 , admitted that " an @entity21 - @entity11 child is roughly five times as likely as a white child to see the inside of a prison			1
" but he surely could n't have imagined that only a couple of hours before his oration , one of @entity11 's most prominent scholars -- and a distinguished professor at @entity19 's alma mater , @entity31 -- would breathe cruel and ironic life into that sad statistic			1
@entity13 is simply the most powerful and influential black scholar in our nation 's history			2
he received a doctorate at @entity38 long before the culture wars became au courant ; he was among the first group of figures to receive a @entity44 " fellowship ; he wrote the finest work of literary criticism in a generation with " @entity48 " ; he was named by @entity49 as one of the " @entity51 " ; he has a boatload of honorary degrees ; and he has been a ubiquitous media presence and thoughtful interpreter of race and culture for a quarter - century			0
but none of that made a bit of difference when @entity13 returned from a research trip to @entity63 to find the front door to his @entity31 - owned house jammed and enlisted the assistance of his driver to muscle the door loose			1
by the time @entity13 was on the phone with his leasing company , a white policeman had arrived , summoned by a neighbor who spotted two black men looking as if they were unlawfully breaking into the house			2
their stories diverge from here ; the policeman says he asked @entity13 to step outside , @entity13 refused , the officer entered the home and requested @entity13 ' id , which he did n't initially produce , and finally had @entity13 arrested when he followed the officer outside , as @entity13 was " exhibiting loud and tumultuous behavior			2
" @entity13 allegedly shouted , " is this how you treat a black man in @entity11 ? " and " you do n't know who you 're messing with			1
" @entity13 says he showed the officer his id , demanded that the officer identify himself , which he did n't , and then the professor followed the officer outside to get the policeman 's name and badge number when he was arrested by the gaggle of police who had gathered			1
several features of the story scream the presence of lingering bias and racism			0
a black man in a tony neighborhood simply seems out of place , even to his neighbors			0
had @entity13 been a white professor trying to get inside his home , and called on his driver to help him jar his door open , he probably would n't have as readily aroused the suspicion of neighbors			1
and when police arrived to check out the premises , they probably would n't have been nearly as ready to believe the worst about the occupant of a home who clearly was n't engaged in a criminal act			0
whatever one believes about what happened , @entity13 clearly was n't the beneficiary of the benefit of the doubt , a reasonable expectation since he posed no visible threat			2
it is also striking that @entity13 seems to be the victim of a police mentality that chafes at a challenge of its implicit authority			2
while that may be true for folk of all races , it seems especially galling to cops to be questioned by a person of color			0
how dare black folk believe that , regardless of their station or privilege , they have permission to speak back -- or speak black -- to state - enforced authority , one that , not a decade ago , routinely ravaged black communities in blatant displays of wanton aggression			0
it is for good reason that police brutality is a constant concern for black folk ; the stakes are often high and harmful			0
the link between black vulnerability and racial profiling -- of setting in one 's collective imagination an image of black men as bad people who are liable to commit mayhem at any moment , and who must therefore always be suspected of wrong and subject to arbitrary forms of control and surveillance -- is evident in the pileup of black bodies , from @entity173 to @entity174 , that testify to the force of police to impose lethal limits on black survival			1
@entity13 rubbed up against the unspoken code that enforces black silence and often violently compels black compliance			2
in the end , @entity13 ' unjust treatment speaks volumes about the cynical assertion that we now live in a post-racial paradise			0
@entity190 ' crime appears to be a new one in the litany of crimes that black folk commit by virtue of their very existence -- in this case , @entity199 , or housing while black			0
if a famous and affluent black man in his own home can be accosted , arrested and humiliated , then all black folk can reasonably expect the same treatment			0
to @entity13 ' credit , he realizes that racial profiling happens regularly to poor black folk , and he has pledged to do something about it			1
but another famous black figure associated with @entity31 must renew his pledge to get rid of racial profiling and spare the nation the illusion that his success represents a post-racial @entity11			1
while it 's not likely he 'll be unjustly arrested in his @entity217 , he 's got to make sure that the same privilege extends to millions of other black folk who do n't live on @entity221			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity2 .			0

@entity2 : @entity13 is an eminent *intellectual* and @entity31 professor
he says @entity13 ' arrest in @entity228 shows that @entity11 still *grapples* with racism
he says police are particularly *sensitive* to questioning from people of color
@entity2 : @entity19 must renew his pledge to *eliminate* racial profiling
