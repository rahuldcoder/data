-- the late @entity1 was much more than a relic of radio 's @entity4 heyday			1
in this era of streaming and downloading , when everyone functions as his or her own dj and program director , the " tastemaking " role of music radio in the late 20th century -- the role that @entity1 pretty much owned -- is almost impossible to fathom			1
@entity1 was neither a maverick like pioneer rock & roll disc jockey @entity18 nor a budding multimedia entrepreneur like @entity21			2
he did n't strive to be hip or hustle after the cutting edge			0
he was n't really a gatekeeper or curator			2
his on - air presence was neutral ; he merely was a conduit for whatever records were most popular			1
each week he 'd present the top singles as reported on the @entity29 , framing the songs with homespun advice , listener dedications and decidedly noncontroversial anecdotes about the performers			0
from 1970 to 1988 , his syndicated weekly program , " @entity36 's @entity4 , " documented the ever - shifting mainstream of musical tastes			1
by today 's standards , it can sound overly cautious or conservative , but it also reflected a cultural consensus that barely exists anymore			0
@entity1 's long - distance dedications easily accessible and free of charge , " @entity36 's @entity4 " was a gateway drug for a generation or two of budding music fanatics			1
@entity1 was the patron saint of preteen pop devotees held captive to their parents ' car radios			2
his data - dependent chart format made him an enabler for amateur statisticians and precocious list - compilers , kids who could n't afford subscriptions to the trade magazines			0
the sturdy scaffolding under @entity1 's success was his voice : upbeat , naturally modulated , soothing without being smarmy			1
hear him once and he became @entity1 : familiar , somehow			0
you could accuse him of being corny , a shameless @entity63 of sentimental patter and @entity66 © d advice along with pablum pop. you 'd be literally correct but also fundamentally clueless about his down - to - earth appeal			0
@entity1 managed to be commercial without coming across like a hyped - up huckster			1
he made it seem easy , and also seamless , for instance segueing from a convoluted factoid about top 10 hits with the word " doctor " in the title to a @entity79 spot			0
his voice was the product of formative years spent jumping from radio station to station as well as some acting work			0
voice - over gigs proved to be a consistent and profitable sidelight ; @entity1 's resonant tones appeared in commercials and cartoons			1
somewhat improbably , he supplied the voice of @entity90 on " @entity91			0
" no doubt this further endears him to a generation weaned on musty anachronisms such as network television and top 40 radio			0
tributes : ' keep reaching for the stars ' truthfully , even at his most popular , @entity1 was a bit of an anachronism			2
when " @entity36 's @entity4 " debuted in 1970 , the rock revolution was in full swing , and free - form @entity104 was on the rise			1
but he stuck to the @entity107 , and not only endured but thrived during the tumultuous expansion and dissolution of the musical counterculture in the ensuing decades			0
the top 40 renaissance of 1984 , kick - started by @entity112 , and the late ' 90s teen pop explosion can both be seen as vindication of @entity1 's rigidly democratic format			1
in fact , the millennial breakthrough of boy bands and @entity118 may go down in history as the @entity4 's last hurrah			2
born the son of @entity123 immigrants in @entity124 , @entity1 went on to become the iconic voice of common - denominator music during a divisive time in our culture			1
in the end , what could be more @entity36 ?			0

@entity133 : @entity1 was " tastemaker " before era of streaming and downloading
@entity1 's " @entity36 's @entity4 " was n't gatekeeper but a conduit for popular songs , he says
@entity133 says @entity1 's show was accessible ; his voice upbeat , not smarmy
