-- two dozen lions rescued from harrowing conditions at circuses in @entity4 have a new home in @entity6 , where they will live outside of cages and roar at the distant @entity8			1
@entity9 ( @entity9 ) brought them last week to @entity11 , where they were transported to the @entity13 , to conclude its " @entity14 " the flight followed the passage of a 2009 law in @entity4 that bans the use of any animals in circuses			1
the 25 felines are currently housed in a 15,000 - square - foot temporary biosphere , complete with grass , trees and other natural features , at the sanctuary in @entity27 , about 30 miles northeast of @entity11			1
they 're sleeping better , are getting exercise and have begun to roar in unison , " which demonstrates they are beginning to bond as we expected , " said @entity34 , executive director of the sanctuary			2
the @entity9 campaign and airlift got a big financial boost from tv game show host @entity39			1
@entity39 and actress @entity41 of " csi " described the campaign wednesday night on @entity44 's " @entity43			1
" it is a true testament to the @entity4 people what they were able to accomplish quickly , " @entity41 said of the law and the rescue of the lions , which were part of eight circuses			1
of the 25 lions , 24 were seized from circuses , many the traveling variety			1
eight were living in a cage pulled by a truck , @entity41 said , and at least two had never seen other lions			2
the sanctuary is building a permanent 80 - acre fenced site for the lions , which will live in four prides , @entity34 told @entity0			1
they 'll get along just fine with the climate in @entity6 , he said , because they are exposed to the cold in @entity68			1
living in @entity4 put them in a much warmer climate that will require acclimation until they are released into the permanent living area in late march or april			1
" it was a surprise to me to know that lions are genetically wired for winter , " said @entity41			2
the 320 - acre sanctuary of rolling grasslands , split into habitats , houses more than 275 large carnivores , including bears , tigers and other big cats			1
the @entity13 emphasizes its mission is to serve as a sanctuary , not for entertainment			2
" it 's a home for animals , not a zoo for people , " @entity34 said			1
animal rights activists and groups are optimistic that @entity4 's 2009 action will lead other countries to ban animals in circuses and change conditions in zoos			1
" i 'm against zoos			0
i consider them prisons for animals , " @entity39 told @entity44			1
the sanctuary uses proceeds from its annual 50,000 visitors to cover the costs of their visit , @entity34 said			2
" we hope they become long - term contributors			0
" about 80 percent of the carnivores at the facility , which costs about $ 2.5 million a year to operate , were in the @entity115 when they were seized from deplorable or illegal situations , he added			0
most of the lions will have a lifespan of about 21 to 23 years , double their expected longevity in the wild			0
that 's largely because they have no predators or competition from within their population			0
lionesses receive estrogen implants so that they wo n't go into heat			0
that reduces the competition and fighting among males			0
@entity34 praised @entity4 for taking action			2
" this is the first country that stepped up , " he said			0
he expects @entity137 , @entity138 and other countries to take steps that eliminate or limit the use of animals in circuses and other entertainment venues			2
cities and states in the @entity115 are taking a hard look at the treatment of elephants and carnivores , according to @entity34			0
the 25 lions are adjusting well , appear calm and enjoy stretching their legs while running and playing			0
" like many rescued animals that come from extreme captive situations , they are quickly accepting all of the positive changes that are happening , " @entity34 told @entity0			0
" there is nowhere to go but up when you have lived at the bottom , so they are open to grasping every opportunity to enjoy life that we present			0
this will continue all the way until they are roaming freely in large acreage habitats , when they can complete their journey			0
