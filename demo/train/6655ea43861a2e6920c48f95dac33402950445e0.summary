when @entity1 became the first @entity2 this week to get her name on a world - renowned monument to the entertainment industry -- the @entity7 -- the 34 - year - old recording artist recalled what her mother told her at age 7			1
" one day , @entity1 , your name will be here , " her mother said when the two and a family friend visited @entity7 for the first time 27 years ago			1
for @entity1 , the star marked a personal triumph -- as an artist and a latina			2
" if by coincidence you happen to look down to the ground and you see this star , remember that it belongs to each one of you , because it carries the name of a @entity26 woman that , like you , dreams and works and works and dreams every day , " @entity1 said during a public ceremony on @entity28 , with her mom and the same friend present			1
as the latest celebrity to get a terrazzo star , trimmed with bronze , on the sidewalks of @entity7 , @entity1 joins a small but growing rank of minority performers making a dent in an overall industry that some criticize as not inviting enough to african - americans , latinos and @entity48			1
in fact , of the 2,354 stars on @entity7 sidewalks , only 3.4 % of them belong to hispanics such as @entity1 , a @entity50 analysis shows			1
the figure is 5.1 % for african - americans and a mere 0.4 % for @entity48 , according to an analysis of the stars on the @entity59			1
those figures fall short when compared with those minorities ' representation in the nation 's overall population : 16 % for @entity26 , 13 % for african - americans and about 5 % for @entity48			1
list : minority celebs on @entity59 to be sure , the @entity59 functions as a commercial attraction and publicity device , but given the international attention it receives whenever a prominent artist such as @entity1 receives a star , the walk is also a major indicator of industry trends and success			0
@entity7 analysts say they are n't surprised at how the walk lacks minorities , though its sponsor and operator , the @entity7 @entity84 , says it has been working hard to improve diversity in an attraction that stretches for blocks throughout @entity7			1
" the numbers are low , " said @entity88 , an @entity89 assistant professor in the department of telecommunications and an expert in race and media			1
" @entity80 reflects what we 're seeing in @entity7 in general			1
" @entity7 's overall shortcomings in including more minorities -- and representing them as more than stereotypes -- are a longstanding problem that has been roundly decried by minority advocacy groups and many performers			1
still , the chamber says its committee that selects star honorees balances numerous factors in its annual process , including race , gender , nationality , genre of performance and industry type			0
the 2,354 stars on the walk line both sides of @entity28 and @entity119 -- the heart of @entity7 -- and the chamber 's annual 24 or so induction ceremonies are broadcast around the world			1
" we are equal opportunity star givers ! " @entity125 , president and ceo of the @entity127 , said in a written response to questions from @entity50			1
the stars honor celebrities in five categories : motion pictures , television , radio , recording and live theater / performance			2
" the committee tries to select candidates from each of the five categories , so with all of the different factors as well as the makeup of who has been nominated , it is a challenge to balance all factors , " @entity125 said			0
" since day one , we have encouraged minorities to apply , " @entity125 said about the walk , which opened in 1961			2
" when the @entity59 was created , some of the first stars included @entity152 , @entity153 , @entity154 , @entity155 and many others			2
the committee does try to ensure that minorities are represented in the selections , but there is no set mandatory ratio			2
" a @entity50 analysis bears out @entity125 's assertions and shows an upward trend of minority representation on the walk over recent decades			1
@entity166 grew from 1.9 % in 1980 , 2.2 % in 1990 , 2.8 % in 2000 , to 3.2 % in 2010			2
african - americans showed similar growth : 1.6 % in 1980 , 2.3 % in 1990 , 4.7 % in 2000 and 5.1 % in 2010			1
asians posted marginal increases : 0.20 % in 1980 , 0.22 % in 1990 , 0.41 % in 2000 , and 0.43 % in 2010			2
on one level , the walk is a marketing tool			0
" the @entity7 is undoubtedly one of the most successful marketing ideas ever produced , " the chamber touts on its website			1
the marketing aspect -- in which a celebrity sometimes gets a star timed with the release of a new project -- is partly reflected in how the chamber requires a $ 30,000 " sponsorship fee , " often paid by a studio , recording label or even a group of fans , chamber officials said			0
the fee is for the lifetime maintenance of the star , its production , a replica plaque and ceremony costs , officials said			0
" of course , it 's a promotional tool			0
that 's why studios and networks look for it , " @entity7 publicist @entity197 said			1
still , the selection process is a serious - minded affair , according to the @entity59 's gatekeepers			0
a star is awarded after a lengthy process in which hundreds of nomination applications are sent to the @entity7 chamber , and then its @entity59 committee selects the winners , with the approval of the chamber 's board of directors			1
the names also are submitted to the city of @entity217 ' @entity216			0
sometimes , several annual nominations must be made before a nominee finally receives a star , chamber officials said			0
the chamber has other criteria for who gets a star : professional achievement , longevity of five years or more , contributions to the community and the guarantee that the celebrity will attend the dedication ceremony			0
an honoree also has to agree to be nominated , which may be a factor in why not all major celebrities have a star			0
sometimes , a performer does n't want one , such as @entity238			0
other notable a-listers without one include @entity241 , @entity242 , @entity243 , @entity244 and @entity245			0
by the end of 2011 -- with a few more minority celebrities scheduled to be honored this year -- the @entity59 will have 77 stars overall given to @entity166 , 119 stars to african - americans or @entity250 - @entity252 ensembles ( three of those performers -- @entity254 , @entity255 and @entity256 -- have a second star , but they are counted only once ) , and only 10 stars to @entity48 , according to the chamber			1
when asked about the dearth of @entity262 artists on the @entity59 , @entity125 stated : " there have been relatively few nominations for @entity262 entertainers			0
someone has to be nominated by a sponsor in order to be considered with a star			0
the issue must be pursued by a nominator			0
the committee can only consider from the pool of candidates that have been nominated			0
" a recent decade - by - decade analysis of the stars on the @entity59 shows that the 1990s were a boom decade for @entity250 , when 49 stars were awarded to them			1
during the 1980s , they secured 24 stars			2
from 2000 to the end of 2011 , the number will be 22			0
latinos , however , have prospered from 2000 to the end of 2011 : nineteen stars were awarded , including four this year alone , according to a @entity50 analysis			1
that compares with 18 during the 1990s and 11 during the 1980s			0
only one @entity262 -- actor @entity289 , who played wise @entity290 in the tv series " @entity290 " -- received a star in the 1980s			0
five @entity48 received stars in the 1990s , but only one ( @entity294 ) has been placed on the walk since 2000 , a @entity50 analysis shows			1
it was the recent success of @entity166 that caught the attention of several @entity7 analysts			1
that trend comes as the @entity301 put the burgeoning @entity26 population at the nation 's no. 2 racial group for the first time ever , displacing african - americans			1
on tuesday , two - time @entity308 and seven - time @entity309 winner @entity1 -- known professionally as @entity1 -- received a star for her accomplishments as a singer , songwriter , musician , record producer , dancer and philanthropist , the chamber said			0
it 's no secret that studios and record labels alike are hoping to find additional revenues in the rapidly growing latino market			0
" one of the ways to get @entity166 into the movie theaters is getting @entity26 stars , " said @entity323 , a @entity324 history professor and author of " @entity326 : how @entity331 shaped @entity332			1
" " @entity7 is also thinking about global markets : @entity335 and @entity336 markets			2
a majority of @entity7 revenue is coming from international revenue			2
it 's a much more significant part , more important to the studios ' bottom line now that it ever has been before , " @entity323 said			0
still , @entity323 was n't surprised by the low minority representation on the @entity59 , he said			2
" it 's probably appropriate to the history of @entity7 , which has mainly been playing to ( a ) mainstream audience , which is a white audience , " @entity323 said			2
" just remember , this is not the consciousness - raising industry			0
this is the money - making industry			0
they will always follow the money trail			0
if they see more latinos going to movies , they 'll feature more @entity26 stars			1
" in the end , that reality may put more minorities in @entity7 -- and on its @entity59			1
" very simple , " @entity323 said			0
" more minority audiences , more minority stars			2

@entity50 analysis : minorities are *underrepresented* on the @entity7
" the numbers are low , " one *university* expert says
of the 2,354 stars on @entity7 , only 5.1 % go to *blacks* and 3.4 % to @entity26
@entity48 have only 10 stars , or 0.4 %
