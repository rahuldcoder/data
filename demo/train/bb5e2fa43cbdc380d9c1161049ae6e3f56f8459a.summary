@entity0 , @entity1 -- new @entity4 airstrikes shook @entity0 into early tuesday after the alliance 's secretary - general dismissed complaints that the allied campaign against longtime @entity10 strongman @entity9 had fallen into a stalemate			1
at least three rounds of explosions echoed across the @entity10 capital in a three - hour span that began late monday , and the roar of jets could be heard overhead			1
@entity19 spokesman @entity18 told @entity2 that the warplanes hit administrative buildings in central @entity0 , and that a nearby hospital was " indirectly " affected			1
" @entity23 was an exceptional night in @entity0 , " @entity18 said , noting that the strikes followed " an extended period of calm			1
" " it is very sad , " he said			0
" we are losing people every day on both sides			0
we think it is time to sit down and talk			0
" @entity4 warplanes and missiles have been pounding @entity9 's forces and government installations since march 31 as @entity9 attempts to put down a nearly three - month - old revolt against his rule			1
secretary - general @entity38 told @entity2 on monday that @entity9 and his regime " have no future , " but refused to predict how long the @entity10 leader could hold on			1
@entity38 denied that the situation in @entity1 had devolved into a " stalemate , " insisting that @entity4 was " making progress " and had " taken out " a substantial part of @entity9 's military capability			1
he said a political solution was required to bring the conflict to an end , but " it 's hard to imagine an end to the violence as long as @entity9 remains in power			2
" despite the ongoing bombardment , @entity9 's forces have been inflicting a heavy toll on rebels in the port city of @entity61 , survivors there have told @entity2			1
@entity61 is the only city in western @entity1 held by the rebels , and witnesses say indiscriminate shelling has left victims with crushed bones , burns and amputations			1
" they are shelling the port and civilian neighborhoods			2
it has become an operation of revenge , not just taking over the city of @entity61 , " said @entity70 , a rebel who was injured in the fighting and evacuated to @entity72			1
@entity77 , a spokesman for the rebels , said fighters attacked @entity9 's forces about 22 kilometers ( 14 miles ) from @entity0 , killing 12 and hitting a tank			1
the situation in @entity61 " is at the forefront " of @entity84 concerns about @entity1 's civilian population , @entity85 , the @entity84 undersecretary - general for humanitarian affairs , told the @entity87 on monday			1
two months of fighting and the ongoing shelling of the city 's port has prevented aid ships from docking there , and between 150 and 300 non-libyans are still waiting to be evacuated , she said			2
" some people are running short of food , water and other basics , " she said			0
" medical facilities need supplies and more trained personnel			0
" the @entity87 voted in march to authorize the use of force to protect @entity10 civilians from @entity9 's regime			1
nearly 750,000 people have fled the country , another 58,000 are displaced within @entity1 and another 5,000 are stranded at border crossings into @entity1 , @entity111 and @entity112 , @entity107 said			2
for those who remain , @entity107 said the fighting and the sanctions imposed on @entity9 and his allies have caused " a severe disruption of supply lines within the country			2
" the results have been " shortages of fuel , difficulties in obtaining commodities including foodstuffs , medicines and other essential goods , and there have been severe cash shortages throughout the country			2
" @entity1 has about three months ' supply of food remaining ; the mostly rebel - held east has about two months , she said			1
fuel and supplies for desalinization plants and other facilities that provide fresh water to many @entity10 " are running out , " she added			0
there have been widespread assumptions among experts that the conflict between pro- and @entity145 forces will continue to be a stalemate for some time			0
as time wears on , though , human rights groups have expressed growing concern for besieged @entity10 in @entity61			2
the wounded arriving in @entity72 , the rebel hub city , painted a gruesome picture of the fighting in @entity61			1
@entity152 , who was evacuated along with about 800 others on an aid ship charted by the @entity155 , was wounded when a missile struck near her home			0
" i was in my house praying when the first missile landed			0
shortly after , more missiles , one after another started hitting our neighborhood , " said @entity160 , who suffered a broken arm and shrapnel wounds			0
people are scared every moment of the day no matter their age , " she said			0
" oh @entity173 , it 's like a horror movie			0
" @entity175 , who suffered facial burns and shrapnel wounds , said he does not regret fighting			0
" the price for freedom is high and it ( is ) necessary to be liberated from this regime , " he said			0
@entity182 has said @entity9 's attacks in the port city may amount to war crimes			1
a report issued last week by the monitoring group accused @entity189 forces of the " unlawful killing of civilians due to indiscriminate attacks , including use of heavy artillery , rockets and cluster bombs in civilian areas and sniper fire against residents			2
" " i 'm not going to guess about a timeline			0
i want a solution sooner rather than later , " @entity38 said			0
@entity2 's @entity202 , @entity203 and @entity204 contributed to this report .			0
