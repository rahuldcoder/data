-- @entity1 , @entity2 , @entity3 and @entity4			1
i 'm not talking @entity7 products or planetary terms			0
and not just any baby names but ones that have jumped in popularity in 2012 , according to @entity14 's just released list			1
@entity1 ? seriously , who would name their bundle of joy after a frustrating @entity7 product that hardly ever works ? and speaking of @entity7 ( see daughter of @entity20 and @entity21 , ) that name moved up a whopping 585 places on the list of names for girls born in 2012			1
so there could conceivably be a family out there with a daughter named @entity7 and a son named @entity1			1
( hope that entitles the family to a discount on an @entity34			0
) there was a time when bizarre baby naming was something only celebrities did to their kids ( as if being the child of a celebrity was n't challenging enough )			1
there 's @entity44 and @entity46 's @entity45 , @entity47 's son , @entity45 , @entity49 's daughter @entity45 , actor @entity50 's son @entity45 , and the list goes on and on			1
but now this " condition " is apparently spreading to the rest of us			2
in addition to the offbeat names above , 2011 saw babies sporting such names as : @entity59 , @entity60 , @entity61 and @entity62			2
there are even media reports that this past weekend some parents allegedly named their newborn daughter , @entity66			0
that one may turn out to be an internet hoax , but after last year 's story of a child in @entity71 being named @entity72 ( in praise of the role @entity72 played in the @entity71 revolution ) , we ca n't be too far from babies named @entity77 and @entity78 anyway			2
it truly is only a matter of time until you meet a kid named dvr or @entity84			0
apparently some parents believe that giving their child a jaw - dropping name will make him or her more distinctive			1
news flash : it 's not the name that makes your child stand out , it 's his or her achievements			2
while i do n't want to rain on creativity , let 's be honest -- these weird names are more about parents showing off their " cleverness " than about finding a name that fits the child			1
it 's not like the parents got to know the child first for a few months and then said , " you know this baby really is a little @entity1			1
" and do these parents even consider that a baby 's name can cause consequences for the child that the parents never imagined , and in many areas of the child 's life ? when i reflect upon my own name , i realize that my life could have been far different if my parents had followed their initial instincts when naming me			1
my @entity119 father wanted to name me @entity120 after the famous @entity122 leader , while my @entity124 mother wanted to name me @entity125			0
instead they compromised on @entity127			0
growing up in @entity128 , @entity127 was not a common name			0
but it actually made me feel different in a good way being the only @entity127 in my class			0
and even today in looking at the list of baby names for 2012 , i was actually happy that @entity127 was not in the top 100			1
still , the truth is , if i 'd been named @entity125 , i would have certainly been viewed as more ethnic by teachers , potential employers and co-workers			0
i would have been required to continually overcome cultural stereotypes			0
and if i 'd been named the very @entity142 , you could just imagine all the " fun " i would have had in post- 9/11 @entity143			0
i would have likely volunteered for " random " security checks at the airport to make it easier for all involved or simply got used to taking the bus cross country			0
but there 's a difference between a name that is n't overly common and naming your child after your favorite appliance			1
a name is a big part of a kid 's identity			0
it can trigger impressions about a child even before we meet him or her -- a particular problem among the closed - minded of the world , but this is the world your child will have to navigate			2
for example , studies have found that children with names that linguistically sound like they come from a lower socioeconomic status are less likely to be recommended by school officials for gifted classes and actually more likely to be labeled as learning disabled			2
other research has revealed that boys with feminine sounding names -- such as @entity178 or @entity179 -- have had more disciplinary problems in school because of their response to teasing			2
still other studies have found a link between how much people like their own names and their level of self - esteem			1
so , parents , keep in mind that your choice of name will have a lasting impact on your child -- both for good and bad			2
and if you insist on picking a bizarre name for the baby , then i propose that your child be empowered to rename you with any name he or she chooses			0
at least then it 's fair that a child named @entity66 has parents named @entity201 and @entity202			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity205 .			0

@entity205 : a new list of popular 2012 baby names *includes* @entity1 , @entity3 , @entity4
he says it 's not just celebrities with offbeat baby - naming now ; it 's spreading to the rest of us
he says studies show distinctive names can spur teasing and *mistreatment*
@entity205 : parents , think twice on names ; it could have long - term effect on your child
