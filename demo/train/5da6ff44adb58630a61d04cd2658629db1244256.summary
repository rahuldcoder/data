@entity0 -- we 'd been in @entity3 for several weeks , watching out of our windows as smoke hovered almost daily over the city 's skyline			1
where we were staying holed up was somewhat safe but it did n't insulate us from the noise of the battles threatening to engulf the @entity13 capital			1
one day we stood outside a local ice cream seller 's shop as tracer fire lit up the night sky			1
the ice cream seller then tried to give us our cones for free			2
as foreigners , we stood out in a crowd of locals , all of whom were weirdly protective of @entity3 and put out that we were n't seeing their city at its best			1
in a lull in the fighting one man turned and asked me if i 'd gotten chance to see the window @entity31 was lowered from before his escape to @entity34 - a popular attraction for western tourists			2
i promised i 'd put it on my list of things to do			2
all of us were trying to avoid discussing " these problems " as @entity40 euphemistically refer to the threatening civil war			1
in private , others were more forthcoming			2
in a doctor 's examining room , on auto pilot i started my practiced patter that " things were n't as bad as i 'd expected , " only to be cut short by the doctor who said simply , " you seem really nice , please promise you 'll go back to your country soon			1
" @entity0 faces societal fissures but i did n't want to go , there was so much more here i wanted - needed - to see			1
the next day though i thought of his advice			2
after successfully navigating the @entity3 back streets to avoid the myriad checkpoints it was with a great sense of irony that we had to pull over at one to ask for directions to the nearest highway out of town			1
my only hope was that the soldier would believe that actual " terrorists " -- as the @entity13 authorities refer to the opposition fighters and activists -- would surely be slicker			1
with a great show of exasperation he described the route out to @entity76 , checked we 'd understood and made a great show of waving us through			2
at the next checkpoint the soldier had a list of those wanted for questioning , i held my breath as he looked me over			2
two meters , about the length of the car 's hood , up the road there was yet another checkpoint , this one had appeared while were navigating the first two			1
eventually though we were through and on our way to " @entity0 " as @entity76 had declared itself			2
its citizens were among the first to take to the streets after the @entity13 uprising began but the town 's proximity to the @entity101 military airport had brought them uncomfortable scrutiny from the @entity104 intelligence service			2
the young activists we met told us with pride that @entity76 had almost emptied as security raids hunted activists down in alleyways and as they hid at the homes of friends and relatives			1
nowhere was safe for them			2
for most of the last two months the @entity116 had maintained control over the town			2
regime forces had to content themselves with shelling from a distance			0
as we drove through town we found a clean up underway and for the first time the anxiety i 'd been carrying around all the time while in @entity0 had started to dissipate			0
their belief that the war had been won was clearly catching			0
when it came time to break the fast , -- this was during the @entity132 month of @entity133 -- they spread out local delicacies and made me try a liquorice drink that was possibly the most disgusting thing i 'd ever tasted			0
@entity137 : @entity138 ' disconnected from reality ' they laughed and snapped pictures on their phones as i struggled to keep a straight face			1
until then i had n't realized quite how young they all were			1
looking around properly i realized they were all in their late teens or early twenties			0
one young man came and sat at the end of the table with me			1
he wanted to talk about his detention at the hands of the @entity13 forces			0
as his story tumbled out , i had to struggle to take in what he was describing			0
he told me that he 'd been raped with wooden sticks during interrogations ; that he 'd watched others forced to carry out sexual acts on each other , and that during the beatings they would make them hold salt in their mouths			0
he recounted a litany of abuse and humiliations , all in the same deadpan voice			0
two more young men came forward with similar stories			1
they showed me the scars the shackles had left on their ankles and wrists , and the marks of the electric clips on their nipples			0
they seemed to want to tell me everything			0
we too quickly ran out of time			0
they were very keen for me to see their nightly demonstration , though it more closely resembled a celebration			0
young men joining arms around drummers performing the familiar chants of the revolution that we 'd all grown accustomed to from grainy @entity194 videos but this time inflected with song and the belief that victory was close			1
as we drove to where we were spending the night we heard the rumble of mortars overhead			0
" do n't worry , " we were told			1
" it 's somebody else 's turn tonight			0
" on our next visit i had gotten so used to hearing in @entity3 that " something is happening " that i was almost inured to it but when the shelling began it felt closer then it ever had			1
we were advised to leave and we did			0
many of those who helped us are still inside @entity0 so i do n't want to say anything more but in the days and nights after we left i stayed close to my laptop and phone			1
in the beginning they tried to stay in touch			0
as bombs fell they went out and filmed video after gruesome video			0
i play them back , listening to the voices of young men i 'd grown to know and like , narrate the unfolding massacre			1
very quickly , even that contact was gone			1
the government had cut the power supply in to @entity76 and conserving phones was a matter of survival			0
it 's they only way they can hope to let the world know what is happening			0
to protect their families many have gone in to hiding , constantly on the move			0
every once in a while i 'll see that they 've managed to get online but only very briefly and then they 're gone again			0
this is the only proof i have that they are still alive			1
@entity0 explained : what you need to know			0

in @entity3 , people watch as tracer fire lit up the sky
locals were *annoyed* we were not seeing the best of their city
we tried to avoid contact with security *officers* but needed their help with road directions
young fighters laughed with me ; now after sustained attacks i do n't know how many are still alive
