-- the @entity3 administration 's attempt to mandate that @entity5 organizations provide contraception to their employees in insurance plans injected some ugly nostalgia into the presidential race in recent weeks			1
" the sexual and religious politics of the 1990s ( are ) suddenly back , " wrote @entity11 in @entity12 , while @entity14 @entity13 said that " we are all @entity16 now " ( somebody tell the @entity18 )			0
president @entity3 has stirred up the @entity22 's inner - fundamentalist -- an angry , vengeful spirit currently being channeled by candidate @entity24			1
as @entity26 leaps to the top of the national polls , it does indeed feel like a return to the 1990s			0
in that decade , the prominence of @entity31 and guns created a brutal partisan atmosphere that pitted liberal against conservative , libertine against fundamentalist			0
but while the issues @entity24 is pushing are the same , @entity37 in 2012 is different place			2
@entity24 will have to sell his social conservatism to the " @entity46 " generation -- people who are a little more tolerant than their parents were and lot more interested in positive solutions to economics problems			2
in other words , this is not your mother 's culture wars			1
that one , the old one , was formally declared 20 years ago by conservative pundit and presidential candidate @entity53			1
on august 17 , 1992 , he told the @entity54 , " there is a religious war going on in this country			1
it is a cultural war , as critical to the kind of nation we shall be as the @entity62 itself			2
for this war is for the soul of @entity37			2
" watching at home , a young @entity67 -- who had just come out to her friends as a lesbian -- recognized the speech as " positive polarization , " dividing the country in two and reaching out to the bigger , more conservative half			0
@entity53 , she once told an interviewer , was " without euphemism , declaring that my own country was at war with me			1
" at the time , a @entity78 showed that only 38 % of @entity37 thought homosexuality was an " acceptable alternative lifestyle			0
" positive polarization worked : the night after the speech , the @entity22 candidate president @entity81 leapt 9 percentage points in the polls and looked competitive against @entity86 challenger @entity85			1
@entity85 still won the 1992 election handily , but the culture war would handicap his presidency			1
it contributed to the @entity22 sweep of @entity92 in 1994 and climaxed in the impeachment of @entity85 in 1998			2
) but @entity37 started to change in the new millennium			0
war and unemployment drew voters ' attention away from social issues			1
religious conservatism as a political project was largely discredited by the burlesque of its leaders			2
televangelist @entity107 claimed he could deflect hurricanes with prayer , @entity106 founder @entity105 blamed 9/11 on homosexuals , and evangelical pastor @entity112 bought crystal meth from a gay prostitute			0
( update on @entity112 : he 's now " what the kids call bisexual			0
" ) of course , social conservative activists never went away -- they just stopped proselytizing and joined the tea party instead			0
a recent @entity121 survey found that the tea party draws a great deal of its strength from religious conservatives			0
sixty - four percent oppose gay marriage , 59 % want abortion illegal in most circumstances , and 42 % say they empathize with the " @entity131 movement			0
" no wonder then that they are thrilled by the so - called revival of the culture war , or that they are gravitating toward the super @entity136			1
there is more than a thematic connection between @entity24 and the age of @entity53			2
@entity24 's campaign manager is @entity141 , who worked for @entity53 in 1996			1
his statewide staff is peppered with former @entity143 ( @entity144 and @entity145 of @entity146 , @entity147 and @entity148 of @entity149 ) , and his list of endorsements is a roll call of ' 90s @entity131 conservatives : @entity154 , @entity155 , @entity156 and @entity157			0
just to complete the picture , @entity158 touted an endorsement from @entity53 's old rival @entity161			1
the revival of the cultural conflict will probably help @entity24 in the @entity22 primaries			1
all his victories have come in @entity167 caucus states , with a turnout presumably dominated by the faithful			0
but within the wider population , the conversation about @entity31 and sex is probably less relevant than it was in @entity53 's day			1
attitudes on abortion have ebbed and flowed , but on everything else the public has mellowed			0
in 1992 , 48 % of @entity37 thought sexual relations between people of the same gender should be legal			0
now it 's 62 % and , for the first time , a majority of @entity37 also support same - sex marriage			2
likewise , @entity185 insists that @entity22 opposition to the contraception mandate will actually cost it votes			1
generational change and economic problems have rendered debates about lifestyle largely academic			0
one might hypothesize that the new culture war is really about partisan battles between political elites rather than a genuine social rift within the adult population			1
at this moment in the news cycle , it hurts @entity3 that he is being screamed at by little old nuns , and it helps @entity24 that he is mobilizing bishops and rabbis			0
but if @entity22 fight the general election on the battlefield of culture , they are more likely to lose			1
join the conversation on @entity213			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity216 .			2

@entity218 says *catholic* contraception dust - up cast by some as new culture war
@entity216 says this may work in @entity22 primaries , but it wo ***n't*** with today 's general voters
he says social issues @entity53 touted in 1992 do ***n't*** *resonate* in bad economy
@entity232 " is more relevant to political elites than voters and wo ***n't*** help @entity22 in election
