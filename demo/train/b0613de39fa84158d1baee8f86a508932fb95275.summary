-- the typical @entity2 itinerary runs something like this : fly into @entity5 and explore the urban hipster scene , hop over to @entity7 for a safari , then down to @entity9 to sip wine on the waterfront with @entity12 in the backdrop			0
and that 's fantastic , but it means most visitors miss out on @entity17			1
@entity5 is trendy , @entity9 is glamorous , but @entity17 is cool			1
that 's why one million @entity2 pack the beaches there every summer ( around @entity21 or @entity22 , book early or do n't bother )			2
if you 're wondering what all those people know that no one else does , here are 10 awesome reasons to visit			0
the @entity30 @entity17 's beachfront was completely redeveloped for the @entity32 , so it 's possible to stroll the length of it on a broad new boardwalk			1
if it 's too hot for a stroll , you can flag a @entity40 rickshaw			2
a century ago , more than 2,000 of them crowded the streets and docks			0
about 20 registered pullers remain , all wearing beaded headdresses that match the decorations on their rides			0
along the roadside , stalls offer beach gear and @entity40 crafts			0
on the beach , sculptors create landmarks and wildlife from the sand			0
@entity17 's beach is one of the few places where @entity2 of all stripes mingle -- surfers , women in burkinis , pensioners on a stroll and kids playing on the well - maintained public slides			1
@entity67 at one end of the @entity30 is @entity69 , which overlooks the mouth to the city 's famous harbor			1
once synonymous with gangsters and dockside prostitutes , @entity69 now hosts high - end condos , linked by canals so you can keep your boat there			0
the main attraction is @entity67 , a water park and aquarium			0
to cool off , you can book a table at the @entity87 restaurant ( +21 328 8065 ) inside the shark tank , or step outside to @entity89 and book a surf lesson			2
@entity17 's beaches are protected by shark nets and the water 's warm enough to swim in year round			1
@entity67 1 , @entity95 , @entity96 , @entity17 ; +27 31 328 8000 @entity97 at the other end of the @entity30 is the city 's sports complex , dominated by the soccer stadium built for the @entity102			1
even if there 's not a match on , it 's worth a visit to ride up to the top of the arch that stretches over the field for an unrivaled view of the city			1
there 's a quick way down via the @entity114 , an 80 - meter free fall over the field			2
@entity97 , 44 @entity117 , 44 @entity118 , @entity17 ; +27 31 582 8222 @entity119 the @entity120 maintains the nets that protect the city 's beaches			1
it 's possible to book an early morning boat ride with the crew that maintains them every morning			2
the boats leave from @entity129 and ride through the harbor , which gives a sense of the gigantic scale of the container ships that serve @entity2 's busiest port			2
it 's rare to see a shark around the nets , but for those that really need a @entity142 moment there are public shark dissections at the @entity120 's visitor center			1
@entity119 , @entity145 , @entity146 , @entity119 ; +27 31 566 0400 the @entity147 at the turn of the last century , @entity148 came to work as a young lawyer in @entity2 , where he had one of his life 's formative experiences -- getting kicked out of a " whites only " train car			2
his reflections on that experience eventually developed into his theories of non violence that would go on to shape his campaign for @entity162 's independence			2
in 1904 he bought some land that became known as the @entity147 , where he lived and opened a printing press to spread his ideas			0
both his home and the press are open to the public			2
bunny chow the origins of the name are a mystery , but this curry served in a hollowed - out bread loaf is the quintessential @entity17 meal			1
no rabbits are harmed , it 's usually beef , chicken or mutton			2
the theory goes that the dish was created as a meal - to - go that farm workers could hold in one hand			0
to sample one , look for any crowded takeaway counter or head to @entity191 's ( 520 @entity190 , @entity17 ; +27 31 205 5363 )			1
art @entity17 's art museum was the first in the country to start collecting @entity2 art. it 's housed inside the city 's @entity197 ( @entity199 , @entity17 ) , which is worth a visit to explore the markets on the surrounding streets or to check out what 's on at the @entity205 - style @entity204 ( 29 acutt st. , @entity17 ; +27 31 369 9555 )			1
contemporary art is best experienced at the @entity207 ( 166 @entity208 , @entity17 ; +2731 277 1705 ) , in a custom - designed building that includes a charming shop and cafe set in tropical gardens			1
old - school luxury there 's a certain amount of colonial fantasy at play , but the terrace at the @entity220 hotel is nonetheless one of @entity2 's best spots for a sundowner			0
the balcony overlooks a lighthouse , and the breeze makes you feel like you 're floating above the ocean , cocktail in hand			0
the @entity231 , 2 @entity232 , @entity146 ; +27 31 514 5000 shopping @entity17 loves its local designers , and with reason			1
for local crafts , you can save yourself a lot of walking and sunburn with a visit to the @entity241 ( 94 @entity242 road , @entity243 , @entity17 ; +27 31 312 3804 ) , a well - curated non-profit that scours the province for the @entity246			1
for fashion , antiques and bric - a - brac , @entity247 in @entity248 is lined with retail gems			0
for something really special , it 's worth trying the fresh market at @entity256 , where there are herbal remedies to improve sex drives or chase off mother - in - laws			0
low - key fine dining some cities keep their best restaurants in posh locales			0
in @entity17 , some of the best dining is at the docks , in a shipping container or in the parking lot of a strip mall			1
@entity271 ( 30 grunter gully st. , @entity17 ; +27 83 291 7835 ) offers wharfside dining with its own brand of upmarket bunny chow and creations like @entity276 ( seared steak )			1
it 's in the sort of neighborhood where movie mobsters might dispose of a corpse , but it 's both safe and worthwhile			0
@entity282 ( 34 @entity281 , @entity17 ; +27 31 309 4453 ) is cut from an old shipping container parked in a courtyard in one of the city 's historic districts			1
their breakfast is tops , with a tart that makes kale appetizing			0
cafe 1999 ( 117 @entity294 , @entity295 ; +27 31 202 3406 ) offers a view of a parking lot , but no one cares because the restaurant is always full of beautiful people and the fresh seasonal food is so good they do n't look up anyway			0
