@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 asks a reporter to translate a card in @entity6 she received from a @entity8 family for whom the @entity1 laborer spent nine months gestating their son for them			1
the letter reads in part : " without your help and sacrifice , we would not be able to have our family			2
please know we will tell him about you and how special you are to us			0
we will never forget you , you will always be in our hearts			0
" @entity3 delivered the boy two weeks ago			0
" of course i feel bad -- i kept the child in my womb for nine months , " she said			1
" but she needs a child ; i need money			1
" surrogacy in @entity1 is booming , thanks to the low cost of the procedure , availability of surrogates in the world 's second most populous country and the fact that @entity1 is one of the few countries in the world that allows commercial surrogacy			1
in one hostel in @entity0 -- a small city known as the " milk capital " of @entity1 in the far western state of @entity45 -- there are 50 surrogate mothers living together , each who will earn around @entity47 $ 8,000 for carrying a baby			1
" it 's a lot of money , " said a woman who identifies herself as @entity50			0
" for people like us who have never seen money , it 's a lot of money			0
" this is the second time @entity50 -- a 30 - year - old who has a son and two daughters of her own -- has carried a child for profit			1
before surrogacy , she and her husband used to earn less than $ 2 a day working in the fields			1
" the first time i came , i made a house , " she said			0
" now i have come for my daughter			0
i have to educate her , i have to get her married			0
" " i want to teach my daughters computers ; i have to educate them -- get ( them ) married to a nice boy , " she added			0
the number of skilled doctors has made @entity1 a global @entity79 for couples seeking someone to carry their baby for them			1
at this hostel , all the women are under the care of dr. @entity86			2
she began caring for surrogates in 2003 , when she helped a grandmother who was carrying twins for her daughter			2
" that 's when i started commercial surrogacy because not everyone is lucky to have a mother or a sister or a friend to carry their child , " she said			1
" the surrogate is getting the life that she dreamed of , because otherwise she could not get this kind of money or change the life for her husband , her children , get a house , educated her children , " said @entity86 , who has delivered close to 700 babies from surrogates for 580 couples since 2004			1
" and the couple could never have had a child if the surrogate had not helped them			1
so -- the ultimate result is a baby has come into this earth , which is beautiful			0
" @entity1 has now taken steps to regulate the industry			1
it 's banned foreign same - sex couples and single parents from hiring surrogates			2
a new proposal would require mothers be aged between 21 and 35			0
@entity86 has had " lots of inquiries from same sex couples but we have never done it			0
not for any other reason , this being a small town , people are not aware of all this and for the surrogate to be introduced to same sex couple would be too much , i felt			2
" critics call @entity1 's surrogacy clinics baby - making factories			1
" commercialization has led to a lot of financial exploitation of these women , " said @entity140 , a women 's rights activist and director of the @entity142 in @entity143			2
although surrogates interviewed by @entity2 in @entity0 say they get as much as @entity47 $ 8,000 , @entity140 said research by the center shows that promised cash from surrogacy clinics often fall short -- sometimes being paid as little as @entity47 $ 800			1
" so its not really a profitable business as is presented , " @entity140 said			0
" if someone really has to opt for the child , somebody 's friend should offer a womb , somebody 's relative should offer the womb			2
why it has to be the poor woman ? it 's like organ sale , " @entity140 added			1
surrogates say locals also look down on the practice			1
" people in the village think it 's a dirty thing			0
old people in the village , they do n't have good thoughts , " said @entity50			0
" for me , dr. @entity86 has done a good thing			0
" surrogate mother @entity3 says the service has completely changed the fortunes for herself and her family			1
asked what she would say to the @entity8 parents who rented her womb : " i 'd say thank you			0
i do n't know how to say anything else in @entity6 ! " i 've got a chance now to make my life , " said @entity3 , wiping tears from her eyes			2
" @entity193 has been kind			0

@entity1 has become a @entity79 for foreigners seeking a surrogate mother to gestate their child
@entity1 is one of the few countries that allows commercial surrogacy , where costs are low
critics say the practice takes *advantage* of poor women and is akin to " organ sale "
surrogates interviewed say the up to u.s. $ 8,000 received rescues them from a life of *poverty*
