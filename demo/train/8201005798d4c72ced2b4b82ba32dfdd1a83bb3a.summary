-- when it comes to saving money on travel , we all know to check discount sites , follow our favorite airlines on social media and monitor our frequent flier points			1
but did you know that you can save big bucks just by opening your mouth ? it turns out that some honest - to - goodness human - to - human interaction can help you win discounts on hotel , cruise and flight bookings			2
we asked four travel experts -- @entity19 of @entity20 ; @entity21 , founder of @entity22 ; @entity23 of @entity24 ; and @entity25 , president of @entity26 -- for simple questions every traveler should be asking to save money			2
their answers , er , questions , are below			2
7 gross wonders across @entity33 is there an upgrade available ? though it may not be in our nature as @entity33 to haggle or barter for a deal , never feel too shy to request upgrades at airports and hotels			2
" just ask all the time , " says @entity25 , president of @entity26			2
" ninety - eight percent of people simply do n't ask			2
the worst answer you 'll get back is no. " @entity23 of @entity47 says , " i 've seen instances where at the very last second they had business class available , so they offered it as an up - sell incredibly inexpensively			2
" @entity54 : top 10 most - visited cities in the world @entity21 , founder of @entity22 , notes that airlines would rather up - sell you a seat in business or first class at a fraction of the cost than be forced to give away those expensive seats for free to members of loyalty programs			1
@entity69 , for example , runs a last - minute program called @entity71 ; beginning 24 hours before your flight , unsold first - class seats can be purchased for @entity73 between $ 50 and $ 500 depending on the length of the flight			2
when it comes to hotels , the same policy applies : ask and you ( may ) receive			1
" always say what you 're celebrating , " says @entity23			2
" drop that it 's your honeymoon , your birthday			2
you just never know what kind of little special things a hotel has in store			2
" if you have kids , she says , ask about a suite upgrade			0
and if you 're a member of a hotel chain 's loyalty program , @entity25 recommends asking for waived fees , free parking , kids ' meals , breakfast or @entity99			0
travel snapshots : @entity102 color around the world has the price changed for my seat / room ? " most people do n't realize that there 's a pretty good chance that a hotel booking is going to go down in price between the time you book it and the time you arrive , " says @entity108 's @entity21			1
hotel rooms and airline seats fluctuate in price , so once you 've booked , it ( literally ) pays to check the price for a ticket or room every day until your vacation			1
if you see that the price has gone down , call the airline or hotel directly to see what they can do for you			1
in many cases , you may be able to cancel your reservation and rebook at a lower price			1
according to a 2011 post by @entity21 on @entity22 , airlines like @entity135 , @entity136 and @entity137 may offer you a travel voucher for the difference in price			1
others , depending on policy , might simply allow you to cancel your flight and rebook at the lower rate			0
but buyer beware : change fees can apply to rebooked flights , so be sure your discount is worth it			0
@entity54 : 10 places you 'd rather be on a wednesday are you running any local deals ? being savvy with social media can obviously pay off when traveling			1
restaurants , spas and museums may use local deal sites -- like @entity158 or @entity159 -- to offer discounts on admission or services			1
it 's always a good bet to sign up in advance for such websites to begin tracking where deals are occurring in your vacation destination			1
" go where the deal is , " says @entity23			0
" more and more companies are starting [ to offer local deals ] as the competition increases			1
" do n't know where to start ? ask your friendly neighborhood concierge , says @entity25			0
this especially applies at resort hotels , he says , where the concierge is likely to have or know about promotions and specials that might not be otherwise advertised			0
the added benefit is that you get to experience your destination like a local			1
" when [ deals ] are sourced locally , it means you 're going to places that are n't designed for tourists , " says @entity23 , and are consequently less expensive			1
hey , why should locals have all the fun ? @entity54 : 30 irresistible photos of fall what 's the resident rate ? what you do n't know about booking a cruise can cost you			0
one hidden savings gem : the resident rate			0
you may be able to cruise for less if you 're willing to depart from a port in your own state			0
and with ports of departure now in over a dozen states , you have a better chance than ever before of being able to leave from your home state			0
if you live reasonably near a cruise port , ask your agent about the rate for in - state residents , which @entity23 says cruises offer at a deep discount to increase sales			0
" it 's wonderful when you can cruise from home			0
basically you 're going on a @entity220 vacation with no airfare			0
" @entity23 notes that while discounts for residents can vary , in - staters may be able to save up to 25 percent on a cruise			0
in addition , when it comes to cruises , negotiate with your travel agent when you cruise , says @entity21			0
agents are offered incentives from the cruise line and can pass that along to you			0
do n't be afraid to ask for perks like shipboard credits , which will help you save you on amenities			0
is there a tourism card available ? @entity19 of @entity20 suggests always asking at the tourism office about a city pass			1
popular destinations like @entity242 , @entity243 and @entity244 offer passes that include admission to high - profile attractions			1
some even include free public transportation or allow you to skip notoriously long lines at tourist hotspots			0
@entity244 offers several varieties of passes that allow you to tailor your experience			0
the @entity256 ( $ 89 for adults , $ 64 for children ) gets you admission to six main attractions including the @entity261 , the @entity262 , the @entity263 , and @entity264			1
you save 46 percent on combined admission -- that 's $ 76 per adult ! where are you going tonight ? ok , that question may sound a little creepy			0
but do n't let that stop you from asking tourism board or visitor center staffers for their own personal recommendations -- not where they send tourists , but where they go themselves			1
they 'll know where to find the best off - the - beaten - path venues and cultural events , says @entity23 , as well as which ones are running deals			1
when it comes to sustenance , chances are they wo n't point you in the direction of expensive tourist traps			0
as @entity19 says , " you 're not going to find @entity244 eating in @entity291			1
" eating at local restaurants or buying at markets the locals use will save you a huge mark - up and give you a more authentic taste of the area			1
