@entity0 -- on saturday he was the comedian - in - chief , cracking jokes with reporters and celebrities at the annual @entity7			2
on sunday he oversaw one of the riskiest special forces operations since @entity10 , @entity11 's ill - fated attempt to rescue the @entity13 hostages from @entity14 more than three decades ago			1
@entity15 is n't just the president			1
he 's the nation 's ultimate multi-tasker , juggling enough roles and responsibilities to make the average person 's head spin			2
over the last month and a half , @entity15 held at least five @entity25 meetings to help plan the assault on @entity28 's compound			1
the days in which those meetings were held coincided with , among other things , an education reform speech , two political fundraisers , a discussion with the @entity36 prime minister about that country 's nuclear crisis , a long - awaited deficit reduction speech , and two meetings on immigration reform			1
the day before the last @entity25 meeting -- on april 28 -- the " birther " controversy came to a head			0
@entity15 made a surprise appearance in the @entity7 briefing room to release his long - form birth certificate			1
( yes , he actually was born in @entity48			0
) and in the midst of all the planning , the president cut a deal with congressional @entity53 to narrowly avert a government shutdown			2
he also dealt with a series of devastating storms in the @entity57			0
has this always been par for the course at @entity60 ? not really , according to @entity62 presidential historian @entity61			0
the frenetic pace of the presidency is largely a reflection of @entity13 's role as the premier global power in the @entity69 era , @entity61 told @entity1			0
@entity70 dealt with countless domestic crises during the @entity72 ; @entity73 tackled the @entity74 and civil rights while fighting in @entity76			0
but in recent years , he said , the daily pace has accelerated due to the rise of the internet , wireless , and other facets of the communications revolution			0
there 's a " kind of blinding rapidity " in which one event quickly overtakes the next , said @entity61			0
our attention -- and that of the president -- is whipped from the latest economic crisis to the newest tornado wreckage to the latest protest or outbreak of violence in the @entity95			0
faced with a pressure for constant response , modern administrations face times " of great pressure and intense demand over a series of compelling issues , " he said			1
" ( @entity107 ) @entity106 's burdens were as great as any president will face , " @entity104 noted			1
but the rapid onslaught of information from around the world contributes to " a different sort of feel now			0
" case in point : the execution of sunday 's mission against @entity28 's compound			1
@entity15 was able to " monitor the situation in real time , " according to @entity7 counterterrorism adviser @entity121			2
that ability " does speed things up and create a greater sense of pressure , " @entity104 said			2
@entity104 questioned whether an older person -- including a more hands - off administrator such as @entity129 -- could adequately function in today 's version of the pressure cooker environment			1
he or she " might be overwhelmed , " @entity104 said			2
among other things , " you need to have good health			0
" you also need to be constantly on call			0
@entity143 would " just disappear as president for months at a time and people did n't know where he was , " noted acclaimed @entity138 historian @entity137			1
if @entity15 were to disappear for 15 minutes , people " would freak out			2
" current times are not " uniquely oppressive , " @entity137 noted , drawing a contrast with the divisions of the 1960s and the generations that fought @entity150 and the @entity151 , @entity137 said			1
but globalization and the interconnectedness of the modern age -- while increasing the flow of information -- have contributed to an overarching sense of " frustration and fear " that the administration is now confronting			0
@entity161 , a @entity162 political scientist , noted that every president since @entity164 has recognized the need for an executive office equipped to handle " a wide range of issues quickly and responsibly			1
" @entity164 " laid the foundation for the @entity171 infrastructure of expertise that we see now working for @entity15 ( constantly ) , and that infrastructure gives presidents the capacity " to adapt quickly on a broad range of issues			1
" the key challenge for presidents in the 21st century is knowing when to respond immediately and knowing when to take their time to manage a given situation , " @entity161 said			2
" it is not just that @entity15 has been involved in such a broad range of issues and activities			1
it is that he has handled them each differently and appropriately , " she asserted			0
the president 's speech late sunday night " reinforced an image of a man -- as commander - in - chief -- who knows how to prioritize the nation 's interests , " she said			1
@entity161 argued that the " 24/7 news media and now social media puts far greater pressure on presidents for an immediate response or reaction to national and world events because voters learn about ( developments ) much more quickly than they used to			1
" but while the " informational time gap between the president and the voters has narrowed considerably ...			0
the president incurs the same costs for reacting rashly or impatiently as his predecessors did in eras of slower technology , " she warned			0
does she agree with @entity104 's assertion that an older person might be overwhelmed by the nature of the modern presidency ? @entity161 did n't say , but she did offer a quote from @entity224 : " energy in the executive is a leading character in the definition of good government			1
" twenty - first century presidents , she said , must have that energy " in all senses of the word			0
" above all , " be sane , " @entity104 concluded			2
" that 's the watchword			0

new : @entity137 says modern times are not " uniquely oppressive "
@entity15 dealt with a number of high - stakes issues in the run - up to sunday 's raid
@entity104 questions whether an older president could cope with today 's burdens
political scientist @entity161 says the 24/7 media is forcing more rapid responses
