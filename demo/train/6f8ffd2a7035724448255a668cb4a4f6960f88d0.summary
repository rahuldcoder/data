-- @entity1 is n't yet known for its sailing prowess , but that may all be about to change			1
the @entity5 is widely recognized as the holy - grail of boating trophies and , for the first time in its 160 - year history , a challenge has been accepted from the technologically mighty @entity11 country			1
@entity12 will be known as the " @entity13 " -- a reference to one of the ancient guardian gods in @entity1 mythology -- and will compete in @entity18 for the 2013 title alongside 14 other teams , including the staple powerhouses of @entity22 , @entity23 , @entity24 and the @entity26 defenders			1
the surprise entry reflects the recent and rapid growth of the sport in a nation known more for its vast ship - building yards than its nascent sailing culture			1
" @entity1 has all the right ingredients to become a great sailing nation , " said @entity33 , @entity12 's founder			1
" we have a high - tech industry , a reputation for holding world - class events and over 2,000 kilometers of coastline			0
" the 31 - year - old , who cut his sailing teeth as a boat builder in @entity24 after graduating from university in the early 2000s , says @entity1 's sailing aspirations have seemingly come from nowhere			1
" when i started sailing at university , there were literally only a couple of hundred sailors in the whole country , and only one major marina , which was built for the 1988 @entity51 , " he said			0
now , according to @entity33 , there are seven marinas in @entity1 -- up from just three in 2008 -- and another 30 or so in the pipeline			1
so what 's prompted all this enthusiasm ? @entity57 arrived in @entity1 from the @entity26 in 2003 and has since established the @entity58			1
he attributes the growing interest in sailing to government policy			1
" several years ago , the @entity1 government chose ' water leisure sports ' as one of the 10 new industries it wishes to develop , " he explained			1
" since then , many towns along the coast , as well as the capital city of @entity69 , have been scrambling to develop the yachting scene in their areas			0
" but there is also another aspect of government policy that @entity33 believes has played a significant role : increased leisure time			1
" until quite recently we had a six - day week , with many people working on saturdays , " said @entity33			0
" since the government introduced the five - day working week , more people have time to explore new hobbies			2
" indeed , @entity33 experienced first - hand the untapped national interest in the sport when he founded the @entity84 in 2008			2
" we had queues literally thousands of meters long ! we had had high hopes but never expected that , " he said			0
according to @entity33 , a total of 300,000 spectators visited the brand new purpose - built @entity90 during the five - day event in 2008			0
the tournament , which was televised around the world , boasts a grand prize of $ 250,000 -- sailing 's single biggest prize			0
although widely credited with being the true driving force behind @entity1 's dawning love affair with sailboats , @entity33 is modest about his ambitions			2
" i do n't think we have a strong chance to take home the @entity5 , " he admitted			2
" i 'm very happy with the team , but we just do n't have the same experience as the other competitors			0
" however , with the introduction of 45 - foot fixed - wing sails ( replacing the smaller , soft sails from previous competitions ) , @entity33 notes that the tournament is likely to be a learning curve for everyone involved			0
" the new style of catamarans should level the playing field , but we still have to be realistic , " he said			0
" i just hope that our example and the continued popularity of the @entity84 will get young people in the country interested			2
" whatever @entity1 's chances , @entity121 is just happy his fellow countrymen are starting to realize what he has known for years : @entity1 's natural potential as a top sailing destination			2
" the scenery varies greatly from area to area , " he said			0
" in @entity69 and @entity131 , you have the backdrop of skyscrapers and tall bridges			0
further south , you have many green hills and various islands to explore			0
" so , could the @entity1 coast really be the next @entity138 ? only time will tell .			1

@entity1 has made a *successful* bid to *participate* in the 2013 @entity5
the move reflects a rapidly growing interest in the sport over the past decade
founder attributes popularity to changes in work laws allowing for more leisure time
