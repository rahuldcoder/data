editor 's note : @entity2 is on @entity3 nightly at 7 and 9 et and also is host of a conservative national radio talk show			1
@entity2 says the decisions @entity7 makes today could have fateful consequences for the future			1
@entity10 ( @entity3 ) -- @entity11 : happy 300th birthday ! it 's 2076 and we 've just invented the time - fax machine			1
( actually , " we " did n't invent the time - fax machine , the state did -- they pretty much control everything now			1
) i 'm faxing this back to you in 2008 because that seems to be the year we had the best chance to reverse our course and get back to the vision laid out by our founding fathers -- a vision that did n't include the government being in the insurance business			1
i do n't have a lot of time ( the state only gives us one 30 - minute break per day ) so let me give you some advice : stop worrying so much about who runs the country and start worrying about who runs your towns , your states , and your @entity40			1
i know you 're all distracted by the presidential election , but for all the money and time poured into it , the truth is that you 're choosing between two roads that will lead you to the same destination			1
sure , one may be the @entity48 and the other a two - lane highway , but you 'll end up at the same place either way			1
decades of @entity53 and @entity54 alike have all chipped in to lead you to where you are today			2
believing that one person , from either party , can change that by themselves is a big mistake			2
presidents are like captains of a large ship : they can map out a course and shout out orders , but without the trust and hard work of the people who actually move the rudders , their commands mean nothing			1
in retrospect , the lack of trust and confidence you now have in your leaders was really the root cause of everything that 's happened since			1
while our founding fathers designed a brilliant system of checks and balances , separation of powers and democratic elections , trust was the one thing they could n't mandate in the @entity88			1
unfortunately , it 's also the foundation upon which everything else is built and once it began to erode , our whole house inevitably began to crumble			2
looking back now , it 's pretty obvious that our trust in government declined at about the same rate as our partisanship increased			1
people became so concerned about getting their party into power at any cost that the truth did n't even seem to matter anymore			1
that 's probably one of the reasons why @entity106 hated the idea of political parties so much			2
here 's what he said about them in his 1796 farewell speech : " the alternate domination of one faction over another , sharpened by the spirit of revenge , natural to party dissension , which in different ages and countries has perpetrated the most horrid enormities , is itself a frightful despotism			2
but this leads at length to a more formal and permanent despotism			2
the disorders and miseries which result gradually incline the minds of men to seek security and repose in the absolute power of an individual ; and sooner or later the chief of some prevailing faction , more able or more fortunate than his competitors , turns this disposition to the purposes of his own elevation , on the ruins of public liberty			2
" i know that @entity106 had a habit for using big words , so allow me to translate into 2008 @entity147 : political parties that put their own success over that of the country 's will be the death of @entity11			1
if you do n't believe him yet , just wait a few more years ... you 're about to see firsthand how right he was			2
after all , if power corrupts , then the kind of absolute power gained by political parties ( and feared by @entity7 ) corrupts absolutely			2
the best advice i can give you is to stop thinking in terms of left and right and start thinking in terms of right and wrong			2
demand the best leaders possible , and then demand the best out of them			0
believe me , when you see what 's coming your way , you 'll realize how little the donkey and the elephant really ever mattered			0
oh and while we 're on politics , one quick thing that i 'm sure you 're curious about : yes , @entity176 is still in the @entity177			0
he 's 159 , but does n't look a day over 91			0
now , let 's talk about the economy			0
let me see if i have this right : money and power made people greedy , so you decided to hand over a bunch of money and power to greedy politicians instead			1
smart ! after using that money to nationalize a bunch of banks , mortgage companies and insurance companies , they moved on to bigger things			0
the airlines came first -- we just could n't live without them			0
then it was the automakers ( @entity201 would 've died ) , health care ( they said they could manage it better ) , and eventually , the oil companies ( i 'm not sure where all of those " windfall profits " have gone )			0
the idea behind it all ( an idea that was eventually turned into law with the passage of the @entity212 of 2011 ) was to " socialize losses " by spreading them out among all taxpayers			1
the pain , our leaders argued , would be minimal that way			0
at least until the bills came due			0
see , we did n't actually have any of the money we were promising everyone ; we were borrowing it			0
it did n't take long before so many of our tax dollars were going toward interest payments that we could n't fund even the most basic of government programs without massive tax increases on everyone			1
people now work most of the year just to pay @entity231 ( or , as we now call him , " comrade @entity232 " )			1
i hear the state censors coming , so let me leave you with a few other quick things : good call on not worrying about protecting our borders			1
that works out really well for you in 2019			0
you might want to spend a little less time worrying about carbon and a little more time worrying about @entity243			0
we 're now in a new @entity245 but , believe me , @entity243 is n't using their nukes to warm any homes			0
( @entity249 @entity250 just revealed to you that @entity243 appears to be refitting their long - range missiles to carry nuclear payloads			1
did you think they were joking or were you just too busy with lipsticks and pigs to notice ? ) the currency of the future is energy			0
those who have it are thriving and those who do n't -- well , let 's just leave it at that			0
drill for all the oil you can , but you also better start seriously looking for some other options			0
in closing , remember this golden rule and you should be fine : your @entity88 will never fail you , but your leaders will			0
be wary of anyone who tries to convince you that it 's the other way around			0
best wishes ( you 're going to need them ) , @entity275 ps it 's not all socialist doom and gloom here in the future			0
we just thawed @entity281 ' cryogenically frozen body and he hit 87 home runs for the @entity284 ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0

@entity2 : @entity11 in 2076 could be a very *scary* place
@entity2 imagines a country that is controlled by an all - powerful state
people lost trust in government because of *uncontrolled* partisanship , he says
@entity2 : *bailing* out *industries* *amounts* to socializing their losses
