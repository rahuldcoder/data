-- on february 3 , the @entity1 beat the @entity2 in @entity3 in what was a thrilling finale to the @entity7 season			1
while that game was played almost three months ago , do n't be fooled into thinking that the @entity7 went into hibernation			0
quite the contrary -- teams , fans and pundits alike quickly turned their attention to this year 's @entity15			1
what is the draft to the @entity7 ? think of the @entity20 group stage draw			2
while that takes place in @entity23 , the @entity15 is held in @entity24 , with neither event involving a playing ball			1
over the years , the @entity15 has arguably been the second biggest single - day @entity27 sporting event behind only the @entity28			2
that may be why league officials expanded it to three days back in 2010			0
for months on end , team scouts , coaches , and officials do their best to evaluate young college talent from across the country in the hope of picking the right players that they are confident will turn into superstars			1
in the course of just three days , the @entity7 's 32 teams get to pick in seven rounds , which amounts to over 250 players being selected			1
while many of the aforementioned players pan out and turn into stars , a large number of them flop on the biggest stage			0
the number one pick was @entity53 , who went on to become a four - time @entity55 and @entity28 champion			0
but the number two pick that year was @entity57 -- arguably the biggest bust in @entity7 history after he was released just a few years into his career			2
do the latter rounds matter ? most definitely , as one of the most famous diamonds in the rough -- @entity64 -- was picked in the sixth round of the @entity67 and 199th overall			0
@entity64 has since guided the @entity68 to five @entity28 appearances , winning three of them			0
while the @entity28 has always been " the " event in the @entity27 , the @entity15 has steadily gathered more steam through the decades to be what it is today			0
the first one -- held in 1936 -- was held in @entity76 and featured players ' names written on a blackboard from which teams would choose from			2
fast forward to the present day			0
the event is held in @entity24 's @entity82 , with rabid @entity7 fans allowed to attend , and most importantly , all three days televised nationally with non-stop coverage			1
the spectacle of young and promising college football players being selected by legendary @entity7 franchises now garners so much interest , that day one of the draft is watched by more people than an @entity93 game -- that 's including @entity94 and the @entity96 's triumph last season			1
how many of the more than 250 players selected will pan out ? only time will tell			1
but one thing is certain : time has cemented the @entity15 as must - see television in the @entity27			0
