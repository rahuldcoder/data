-- @entity1 is a celebration not just of @entity3 's independence , but also of the values that are important to our nation , like liberty , democracy and human rights			1
recently , former president @entity10 suggested that @entity3 should be a little less self - congratulatory and a little more self - critical			2
he was concerned that @entity3 is abandoning its role as a leading advocate for human rights			1
it is hard to disagree with some of his observations			0
but , @entity3 has not fallen behind in providing moral leadership in the world			1
the current period is no different from earlier decades			1
it is not , as @entity10 said , either " cruel " or " unusual			2
" there is no doubt that both the @entity23 and @entity24 administrations have trampled on fundamental human rights norms on the grounds that certain sacrifices must be made in order to protect @entity3 national interests			1
the question naturally arises : could n't the @entity3 have found ways to fight terrorism without turning human rights into collateral damage ? there is evidence that sacrificing human rights has not made @entity3 any safer			1
for instance , the increased use of drone attacks might or might not have disrupted terror networks in @entity41 and @entity42 , but we do know that they have killed and injured countless civilians and inflamed @entity47 rhetoric			0
the issue is n't whether the @entity3 will be able to win a popularity contest in the region ( this is doubtful even in the best of times ) , but rather , that alienating large swaths of the local population makes it much more difficult to defeat terrorism			2
where to find exceptional @entity3 similarly , in the name of counterterrorism , the @entity3 has pursued worrisome policies , including targeted assassinations overseas and intrusions on civil liberties			2
while our country 's counterterrorism policies have compromised its respect for human rights norms , a little perspective is needed			2
@entity3 's human rights policy is bigger than its counterterrorism policy			1
we should not judge the record on the basis of how the @entity3 has fought terrorism			2
we have made good strides			0
in the last 10 years , the @entity3 has been one of the largest supporters of the @entity76 , despite the fact that the @entity78 makes it a point to remind the @entity3 and other governments of their commitments to international humanitarian law			0
the @entity24 administration has championed women 's rights and reproductive health , children 's rights , religious rights and other areas of central concern to the lives of hundreds of millions of people around the world			0
and although the @entity3 still refuses to become a full - fledged member of the @entity96 , it has begun to play a supporting role			0
when the @entity3 speaks about human rights , other countries listen			1
we do not need a perfect score from @entity102 to have our views respected			0
when other countries choose not to listen to the @entity3 or follow its lead , it is not necessarily because we do not practice what we preach ; instead , it is because those countries see human rights as a potential threat to their rule			1
even if the @entity3 had an unblemished human rights record , the @entity115 of this world are still going to massacre their people and authoritarian governments will still imprison and torture their dissidents			1
on the other hand , we must not redact the inconvenient truths of @entity3 foreign policy			0
looking further back into our history , our record in international human rights is a mixed bag			2
during the @entity127 , successive administrations indulged dictators on the grounds that it was necessary for containing @entity131			0
shamefully , the @entity3 did not ratify the genocide convention until 1988			0
the @entity134 administration did nothing to stop the @entity137 genocide in 1994			0
the world ratified the @entity96 in 2002 without our participation			0
the @entity3 also has repeatedly censored its own views on @entity142 's human rights record for fear of hurting a key strategic and economic relationship			1
we 're no. 1 ! we 're no. 1 ! we 're ... uh ... not ? even in better days , the @entity3 has often made rotten compromises in the name of security			0
simply put , the @entity3 has championed human rights when it sees no damage to its security and economic interests			1
but when human rights are perceived as potentially detrimental to national interests , the @entity3 has consistently chosen interests over values			1
@entity3 's support for human rights has had its ups and downs			1
hopefully , in the future we 'll see more ups than downs , and have more to celebrate			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity166 .			0

@entity166 : @entity1 is also about celebrating our values , like human rights
@entity166 : @entity3 has not fallen behind in providing moral leadership in the world
he says the current period is no different from earlier times , it is not " unusual " or " cruel "
@entity166 : simply put , the @entity3 has consistently chosen national interests over values
