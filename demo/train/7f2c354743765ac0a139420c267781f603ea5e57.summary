-- professed " @entity2 " @entity1 began collecting sea glass from the new jersey shore when she was 5			1
she recalls that when she was younger , before the glass became scarce , you could walk home with a bucketful after a day at the beach			2
now , 10 months after @entity10 hammered the @entity12 coastline , the @entity14 resident says she 's shocked by how many of the frosty relics she found while walking along @entity16 back home this summer			1
" it 's everywhere , " @entity1 said , explaining how she found two large bags of sea glass in a variety of hues : brown , white , blue , milky green and a " gorgeous " red piece she ca n't take her eyes off			1
we can thank @entity10 for the finds , said coastal geologist @entity29			2
" this is an epic summer for a collection of beach glass , " she said			0
sea glass , or beach glass , begins essentially as garbage -- broken glass dumped into fresh or salt water			1
over time , waves , water and sand smooth its sharp edges			0
it 's the smaller pieces of sea glass that usually get brought onto shore for people to pick up , @entity29 said			1
it 's well - known that hurricanes erode seashores and hamper tourism , but , according to @entity29 , a storm like @entity10 -- which boasted record - high waves in late october -- can filter larger , coarse materials from the seabed and wash them onto the shoreline			2
that 's good news for beach - side businesses that sell their finds			0
as @entity10 swallowed beaches and deterred patrons , businesses in southern @entity64 's @entity63 suffered , said resident @entity67			1
her son - in - law 's @entity69 , where @entity70 works as the jewelry manager , were among the few fortunate			0
never mind the sea glass ; @entity70 's eye is drawn to the " @entity74 " -- clear quartz pebbles that , when polished , resemble real diamonds -- and @entity69 are known for their collection			1
the pure quartz pebbles , which break off from pockets of quartz crystal in the upper reaches of the @entity83 , have always been in abundance , but bigger pieces churn up after a storm			2
that 's why @entity10 and the february nor'easter were " a blessing , " @entity70 said			2
" thank @entity90 they keep coming in , " she said			0
though @entity10 did n't damage @entity63 may as much as other parts of @entity64 , many residents and visitors assumed beaches and shops there were closed , so @entity74 tourism suffered and business was slower than usual , @entity70 said			1
" we had people calling , ' are you open now ? ' " she said			0
" but we were never closed			0
" gov. @entity104 's administration announced last week that every public boardwalk and beach along the new jersey shore is now open , after 10 months of renovations and " beach replenishing			1
" @entity70 said she 's already seen an increase in tourists this summer at @entity113 , where visitors can be found scouring the beach for the quarter - size " diamonds " washing up on the shore			0
despite the good news for many businesses , @entity118 - @entity117 is concerned that beach replenishing -- by which sand from other areas is used to revitalize an eroded beach -- might affect the abundance of sea glass , much like she worries construction and spiking insurance rates along the coast could affect the shoreline 's pristine quaintness			1
" i 'm afraid @entity64 's shoreline will be one big mcmansion , and that saddens me deeply , " she said			2
in addition to the sea glass she collects to craft into jewelry , which she sells , @entity136 - @entity117 also keeps a personal collection of about 500 " really fantastic " pieces , most of which she collected while living in @entity147			1
but her best piece is one she picked up in @entity149 , @entity64 , she said			0
the heavy , 8 - inch - long , clear glass is actually a deck prism , which sailors used in the upper deck of a ship to illuminate the ship 's passageways below deck			0
it 's one she wo n't be selling , she said			0
" i only keep the real unusual , " she said .			0

sea glass , scarce before @entity10 , makes *resurgence* in @entity64
in southern part of state , @entity63 may " diamonds " from @entity83 wash up
*governor* says all beaches , boardwalks open after 10 months of repair
