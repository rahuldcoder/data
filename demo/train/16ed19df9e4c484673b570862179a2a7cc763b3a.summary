-- @entity2 defensive end @entity1 , who was convicted of domestic violence this summer , did not play sunday in his team 's win over the @entity6			1
the news comes amid increased focus on the @entity9 and the way it handles players accused of domestic violence			1
until the team 's surprising announcement just before game time , @entity1 was set to play sunday			2
@entity16 , recently released by the @entity17 , and @entity19 star @entity18 wo n't play either			1
@entity18 was placed on the inactive list late last week after he was indicted by a grand jury in @entity22 on a child abuse charge			2
he tweeted a photo on sunday of a highlighted religious devotion that cautions people against passing judgment			0
@entity16 , meanwhile , might never play again , since the @entity9 suspended him indefinitely after a video was posted online that showed him punching out his now - wife in february			1
' zero applause for the @entity2 ' authorities say @entity1 in may choked his then - girlfriend , threw her around , dragged her by her hair and threatened to kill her			1
he was sentenced in july to 18 months of probation and a 60 - day suspended sentence for the misdemeanors with which he was charged			2
the 6 - foot - 4 , 275 pound defensive end says he is innocent and has appealed a guilty verdict rendered by a @entity42 judge in @entity43			2
critics had wondered how @entity16 could be suspended while @entity1 had not			1
even after the @entity2 deactivated him sunday , it was too little too late for some			2
" zero applause for the @entity2 , " @entity48 's @entity47 tweeted			0
" they ceded to press / public pressure			0
it was disgrace it took this long			0
" ' climate has changed ' the @entity2 drew heated criticism over its handling of @entity1 even while speaking out against domestic violence			1
owner @entity59 , while accepting a civic award last week , began to cry while speaking about domestic violence			1
" when it comes to domestic violence , my stance is not one of indifference			1
i stand firmly against domestic violence , plain and simple , " he told the audience in @entity67			1
" to those who would suggest we 've been too slow to act , i ask that you consider not to be too quick to judge			0
" although he did not mention the words " domestic violence " in his post-game remarks , @entity2 coach @entity73 obliquely acknowledged the controversy looming over not just @entity1 , but over the entire league			1
" the climate has changed , " he said			0
" we really do have to get this right			0
i understand that " harsher penalties for domestic violence in the wake of the @entity16 incident , @entity9 commissioner @entity85 announced more severe punishment guidelines to the @entity9 's personal conduct policy			1
according to an august 28 memo sent by @entity85 to all 32 teams , anyone in the league -- players or team personnel -- will be suspended for a minimum of six games for a first offense of domestic violence			1
players are granted the opportunity to appeal			0
@entity16 has until midnight tuesday to file his appeal , if he chooses to do so			0
what 's not clear is whether the @entity9 would apply these new guidelines retroactively , which is perhaps one explanation as to why @entity1 -- sentenced a month before @entity85 's memo -- has not yet been dealt with by the @entity9			0
another explanation could be that the league is waiting for the legal process to play itself out			0
@entity1 has another trial scheduled for november			2
@entity0 reached out to the @entity9 sunday but had not immediately heard back			0
meanwhile , @entity1 will continue be paid while he is on the inactive list			0
@entity0 's @entity112 contributed to this story .			0
