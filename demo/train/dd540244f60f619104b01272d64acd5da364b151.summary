@entity0 -- the @entity2 is portraying @entity3 as a major customer for @entity6 military equipment , worth an estimated $ 6 billion in the past decade , even as @entity6 companies are shut out of a multibillion dollar bid for fighter jets that @entity3 is starting this week			1
in the newest edition of a congressionally mandated report , the @entity2 signaled that it was hoping to interest @entity3 in its top - of - the - line and most expensive weapon , the @entity13 , still being tested			1
arms sales , as well as more frequent military exercises and exchanges , are seen as an important ways to cement ties between the two countries			1
but @entity3 does n't always buy @entity6			2
recently , @entity3 considered and then rejected a major purchase of @entity6 @entity21 and f - 18 fighters , a expensive setback for @entity6 arms sales and the @entity6 aviation industry			1
that deal -- now between the @entity27 and @entity28 -- is a reminder of the vast sums in play			0
" with a potential contract price of us $ 9 billion to us $ 14 billion , this is the single biggest competition in the global defence aviation industry at the moment and offers both bidders a much - needed opportunity in a major market , " said @entity32 , @entity33 at @entity34 said in a statement			0
arms sales , as well as more frequent military exercises and exchanges , are seen as an important ways to cement ties between the two countries			2
the @entity2 downplayed any suggestion that arms sales and other contacts could backfire and that next - door @entity49 may feel new pressure both in its already - strained relationship with @entity0 and with its historical enemy , @entity3			1
" it 's important that none of us think about relationships in this region as a zero - sum game , " said deputy assistant secretary of defense @entity53 at the @entity2			0
" we have valuable relationships with @entity49 and valuable relationships with @entity3 and these things can co-exist			0
" @entity53 signaled that he hoped the relationship , and the arms sales would continue to grow			2
" i think there is a great potential to do much more , " @entity53 said in a briefing at the @entity2			0
" @entity3 sees the @entity6 as a reliable defense supplier and we have been able to provide some top - of - the - line equipment			1
is there some potential for more ? certainly there is			0
that is for the government of @entity3 to decide " @entity75 of the @entity76 , a long - time observer of @entity6 and @entity3 affairs , said the report should be a catalyst to deepen defense ties and possibly lead to a loosening of present export and licensing controls			2
" the @entity2 offer to provide @entity3 with information on the @entity13 sends a clear signal that the @entity6 considers @entity3 one of its most important future defense partners and is willing to consider co-production of some of its most sophisticated defense technology , " @entity85 told @entity1			1
the @entity2 's government - to - government program of foreign military sales to @entity3 have included @entity98 and c - 130 aircraft , radar systems , @entity101 weapons and specialized tactical equipment			1
any consideration of @entity3 's role in the region must include @entity107 and @entity6 concerns about the @entity107 modernization of its armed services especially its navy			0
" the attention given to maritime security cooperation in the report should be seen in light of a series of maritime incidents in which @entity107 naval vessels have challenged other countries ' naval vessels in the @entity120 , " @entity85 said			0
" it is clear that the @entity6 views @entity3 as a leader in helping to maintain freedom of navigation in the @entity126 region and will likely look for ways to enhance @entity3 's involvement in maritime security endeavors throughout the @entity130 in the future			0

the @entity2 tells @entity133 it hopes to interst @entity3 in its most expensive weapon
the top - of - the - line @entity13 is still being tested
but @entity3 recently rejected purchase of other @entity6 - built fightrers
arms sales are seen as a way to cement relations between the @entity6 and @entity3
