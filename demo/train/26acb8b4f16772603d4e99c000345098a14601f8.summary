-- a diabetes test that measures a person 's average blood glucose control over the preceding two to three months is being recommended as the new diagnostic tool for the condition			1
diabetics have too much glucose in their blood when the condition is uncontrolled , and must monitor it			0
a committee of international experts recommended the test , called the the @entity14 assay , at the @entity16 's 69th @entity15 over the weekend			1
the report could instigate a change in the way diabetes is diagnosed , the @entity16 said			2
the @entity14 assay , which has been used for nearly 30 years to determine how well a patient controls diabetes , is a more stable , reliable diagnostic tool than the techniques currently in use , the authors of the report said			1
" this committee that i chaired is recommending that this be used as widely as possible to diagnose diabetes instead of the blood sugar test , " said dr. @entity27 , director of the @entity28 at @entity29 and chairman of the committee			2
the @entity14 test , which consists of a simple blood test , is also more convenient than the two tests commonly used for diabetes -- the fasting plasma glucose and the oral glucose tolerance test -- the authors said			1
in the fasting test , the patient does not eat for about 12 to 14 hours before a blood test			2
in the tolerance test , the patient drinks a sweet solution and has blood drawn two hours later			1
in addition , @entity27 said , " it probably is better related to the development of eye disease with diabetes , and therefore probably serves as a better diagnostic tool			0
" the international committee was assembled by the @entity16 , @entity57 and @entity58 , but those organizations have not officially endorsed the report			0
" basically , the @entity16 supports the concept , supports the use of the @entity14 to diagnose diabetes , and just has to look at the implications of it , and the implementation of it , " said @entity66 , chief scientific and medical officer for the @entity16 , who was part of the committee			1
using @entity14 in diagnosis would be particularly useful for determining whether patients have type 2 diabetes , which is more difficult to diagnose than type 1 , said dr. @entity75 , assistant professor of endocrinology at @entity77 , who was not part of the committee			1
" this will be beneficial to the population in terms of helping us more clearly diagnose folks who are at risks for complications and help them manage that earlier , " @entity75 said			0
still , controversy likely will arise over the use of the @entity14 in diagnostics because of the long , established track record of using the other two methods , @entity75 said			1
ireport.com : boxing champ talks about diabetes struggle how it works humans can not live without having sugar called glucose in their blood			0
too much glucose , however , attaches to a variety of proteins in the body and harms them			0
uncontrolled diabetes is characterized by too much glucose in the bloodstream			0
this excess glucose then glycates with -- or sticks to -- a protein called hemoglobin , which carries oxygen from the lungs to the body 's cells			0
the @entity14 test measures the percentage of glycated hemoglobin in the blood , which is a reflection of average blood glucose control , according to the @entity16			1
@entity14 is a better measure of the problem that diabetes causes than glucose - based tests , at least for monitoring , said @entity123 , professor of biostatistics at @entity125			1
he and colleagues , including @entity27 and a large group of international researchers , studied the relationship between @entity14 and average blood glucose			1
while many diabetics monitor their average blood glucose levels daily , at the doctor 's office the patient receives a measurement in terms of hemoglobin @entity14 , @entity123 said			2
he and researchers created a chart to convert these two measurements , so that patients would not have to interpret two different numbers and feel confused			0
they concluded in a 2008 paper that , for most patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes , a1c levels can be expressed as average glucose			2
the international committee concluded that an @entity14 level of 6.5 percent indicates that a person has diabetes , while values between 6 percent and 6.5 percent are likely to be at highest risk for developing diabetes			2
experts note , however , that there is a continuum of risk for complications , and the " cut - point " of 6.5 percent should not be considered an absolute dividing line			0
all adults who are overweight and have additional risk factors , such as family history of diabetes , high blood pressure or abnormal lipid levels , should be screened for diabetes , according to the @entity16			0
adults aged 45 or older should be tested even if they do not have these risk factors , the association said .			0

@entity173 says @entity14 test is more reliable and convenient than other tests
tests in use now are fasting plasma glucose and oral glucose tolerance test
@entity14 test is currently used for monitoring patients ' control of diabetes
expert : report may cause controversy because of track record of using current tests
