-- feed the world 's starving			1
@entity4 vitamin and mineral deficiencies			0
put an end to crop failure			0
such are the promises of genetically modified ( @entity11 ) rice			1
but if it all sounds too good to be true , environmentalists say , that 's because it is			2
for proponents of @entity11 rice , @entity11 food is the obvious solution to the ongoing problems of population growth , changing climate conditions and malnutrition			1
for its opponents , it 's an unnecessary and potentially catastrophic exercise which only feeds corporate interests and does little to solve the real problems of global food supply , malnutrition and farming practices			0
according to seed producer @entity32 , there are around 81 million hectares ' ( 200 million acres ' ) worth of @entity11 crops presently being grown in the world , representing the work of 8.25 million farmers in 17 countries			1
they are spread mainly between just five countries -- the @entity41 , @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 -- which represent 98 percent of the @entity41 $ 44 billion @entity11 crop market , according to @entity47			1
@entity48 is by far the most important crop for more than 50 percent of the world 's population , according to @entity52 , and relied upon by around 2 billion people in @entity54 for 60 percent to 70 percent of their daily calorie intake			1
@entity54 is the world 's biggest rice market , growing and consuming 90 percent of the world 's rice , according to @entity61			1
globally , we will produce around 633 million tons of rice this year , says the @entity64			0
but in 20 years ' time , that wo n't be enough , according to the @entity66 , or @entity66 ( the self - proclaimed political voice of @entity69 's biotech industry )			1
because of population growth , the rice industry will have 1 billion new customers annually requiring 200 million tons more of rice than there is today			1
to meet the nutritional needs of all of these people -- in addition to the 800 million presently starving -- food production will have to " more than double " in under 40 years , it says			1
but problematic weather conditions such as flooding and drought , brought on by climate change , are putting strains on global food production , @entity11 supporters say			2
and to make matters worse , around 40 percent of crops each year are lost to pests , weeds and diseases , says @entity32			2
@entity11 rice proponents : higher nutrition , environmentally friendly with @entity11 rice , these problems are confronted , if not solved , its proponents say , as different strains of rice can be bred to withstand attack from pests , diseases and hostile environments			1
not only that , they say , but @entity11 rice can be bred to offer much higher nutritional values than regular rice can , supposedly combating the issues of malnutrition that are now endemic in the developing world			1
( according to the @entity108 , around 1 billion pregnant women in @entity54 are @entity109 - deficient ; 2 billion more lack zinc ; while 250 million children are vitamin a deficient			0
) as a result , the @entity112 and @entity113 have developed a @entity11 rice strain they are calling " 3 - in - 1 " rice that is packed with @entity117 , @entity109 and @entity118 , according to the @entity120			1
and @entity48 , developed by @entity32 , is said to be loaded with so much beta - carotene that it can combat the issues of @entity123 ( @entity123 ) to the point that some say it can even prevent blindness			2
the original @entity48 was launched onto the world stage in 2000 by @entity32 , and it has recently been improved to the extent that " @entity48 " now contains 23 times as much beta carotene as the original			2
scientists testing the strain say a serving of 200 grams should provide the recommended daily @entity117 intake ; challenging critics such as @entity136 who previously said its claim of beating @entity123 were erroneous			0
@entity11 proponents are now even claiming that @entity11 crops are more environmentally friendly than traditional crops			2
a study by the @entity143 ( @entity143 ) claims that the effect of farmers in the @entity41 , @entity42 and @entity43 in 2005 growing weed killer - resistant crops was the equivalent to taking 4 million cars off the road and preventing 9 billion kilograms ( 19.8 billion pounds ) of carbon dioxide from being released into the atmosphere			0
the reason : farmers planting these crops did n't need to plough the fields to destroy weeds , which meant the organic matter did n't get exposed to the atmosphere , releasing greenhouse gases in the process , according to the @entity162			0
@entity11 rice opponents : unknown risks , chemical use but for all @entity11 rice 's promises , the world 's leading environmental ngos -- @entity61 , @entity52 and @entity136 -- are simply not persuaded			1
traditional farming practices need to be embraced they say , as farmers have been selectively breeding rice successfully for centuries			0
there are now as many as 140,000 varieties , says @entity61 , which have been developed without genetic tampering to resist particular diseases , or pests , and to survive in drought conditions -- or floods			0
no one knows what the long - term health impact of @entity11 rice is , opponents also argue , and using @entity11 rice seeds leads to the trap of having to buy the chemicals sold by the companies selling the seeds			1
ngos such as @entity61 argue these chemicals are unnecessary , particularly in the early part of the growing season			0
according to @entity61 , the @entity194 in the @entity195 reduced its insecticide use by 95 percent between 1993 and 2003 , " with no yield loss " and a further study found that 80 % of pesticide sprays used in the @entity195 were " unnecessary			0
" then there is the basic concern over introducing foreign genes into the rice itself			0
@entity48 was developed by introducing two genes from a daffodil , for example , while new breeds of rice being given approval by the @entity41 for trials actually contain human genes			2
adding to the concern of unknown health and environmental risks presented by altered rice is this worry : what happens when the seeds contaminate other types of neighboring @entity221 rice ? that question was effectively answered last year , when two global rice scares shook the rice industry and substantially bolstered support for @entity11 opponents in the process			1
a @entity41 rice strain , developed by @entity229 -- which was unapproved for human consumption -- leaked into the global food chain , as did illegal seeds that were being sold in @entity44			0
@entity229 was sued by farmers claiming their crops were contaminated , the @entity237 news service reported ; the world 's largest rice processor @entity240 immediately announced it would stop buying @entity41 rice ; the @entity242 and @entity243 declared import bans on @entity41 rice ; and rice prices went through the floor			1
since then , says @entity61 , and in a resounding victory for the @entity252 movement , 41 rice companies from around the world have come out and rejected @entity11 rice			1
furthermore , key rice producing countries @entity256 and @entity257 have banned @entity11 rice for good			1
those two countries alone account for nearly 50 percent of all global rice exports , according to the @entity260			2
a contentious issue the issue of @entity11 rice has become so contentious that even the co-founder of @entity61 came out publicly in defense of it recently , attacking the @entity260 's " scare tactics and sensationalism " in an issue of @entity267			1
" golden rice can indeed contribute , in a cost - effective manner , to the alleviation of @entity123 [ vitamin a deficiency ] , thereby easing children 's suffering and , in many cases , saving their lives , " he wrote			2
" my old @entity61 compatriots counter these findings not with their own science , but rather with @entity283 - style fictions about ' killer weeds ' and ' frankenfoods			0
' their campaign suggests a complete lack of respect for science and logic			0
" @entity61 argues it is not anti-science or anti-biotechnology , however , and promotes the use of techniques such as @entity294 ( @entity294 ) which allows scientists to breed pest / weather - resistant crops by identifying which gene is responsible for the resistance , then repeatedly cross-breeding and backcrossing them ( to eliminate undesirable inherited traits ) until the desired crop has been achieved			0
@entity52 , meanwhile says the system of rice intensification ( @entity305 ) can save " billions of cubic meters " of water every day ( 40 percent less than conventional methods , it says ) , while increasing yields by more than 30 percent , according to @entity308			2
@entity305 is based on farming methods first adopted in @entity312 in the 1980s and entail : developing nutrient - rich , un-flooded nurseries ( as opposed to flooded ones ) ; planting rice seedlings further apart from each other ; using composts or manure instead of chemical fertilizers ; and controlling the amount of water the rice receives			0
if @entity326 were to dedicate 20 million hectares of land to this system , @entity52 says , " the country could meet its food grain objectives of 220 million tons of grain by 2012 instead of 2050			0
" @entity52 says that if this method was implemented , not only would it save water and bring food security , it would also help the environment -- @entity305 rice fields do not emit methane , @entity52 says , as do conventional rice growing environments			0
