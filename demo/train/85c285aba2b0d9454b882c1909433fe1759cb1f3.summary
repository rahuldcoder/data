-- was it @entity2 or @entity3 who screamed for help the night the 17 - year - old @entity3 was shot dead ? that could depend on which mother the jury believes			1
both @entity2 's and @entity3 's mothers expressed no hesitation friday in separate court appearances as to whose panicked voice is heard screaming during a 911 call from that february 26 , 2012 , night in @entity13 , @entity14 : each said it was her son			1
that contradiction -- with @entity19 insisting it was her son , @entity21 , who cried out , while @entity22 said it was her son , @entity24 , who was yelling after being attacked by the teen -- was central to friday 's court proceedings , and central to the second - degree murder case unfolding in central @entity14			1
@entity2 has pleaded not guilty and claimed he shot the teenager in self - defense			1
the 911 call played twice in court on friday , his lawyers claim , back up their assertion that it was @entity3 , and not their client , who was the aggressor			1
testifying late friday afternoon , @entity22 said she was sure @entity24 was the one yelling			2
why ? " because he 's my son			2
" she answered " all of the above " when asked whether she had ever before heard her @entity2 laugh loudly or cry out for help			2
this instance , though , @entity22 admits was different			2
" i have n't heard him like that before , " she said as her son wiped away tears in the courtroom			0
" the anguish , the way that he is screaming it describes to me anguish , fear , i would say terror			0
" contrast that to the very different story offered a few hours earlier by @entity19 , who was stoic as prosecutor @entity53 played the 911 call			1
when asked whether she recognized the screaming voice , the mother -- who earlier stated that her son was " in heaven " -- said it was that of " @entity61			1
" @entity3 shooting : fast facts defense attorney @entity63 followed up by asking her , " as his mother , there was no doubt it was him screaming ? " she replied : " absolutely			1
" @entity63 then raised the possibility her son , not @entity2 , was to to blame			1
" you certainly hope , as a mom , that your son @entity3 would not have done anything that led to his death , correct ? " he asked			1
" what i hoped for , " said @entity78 , " is that nothing happened and he 'd still be here			0
" parents ' comments pivotal , or do they cancel each other ? more than a year ago , the tale of what happened between @entity3 and @entity2 captured the nation 's attention and shone a spotlight on gun laws as well as race -- given that @entity3 is @entity94 , while @entity2 is @entity95			1
moreover , the case prompted some to question @entity14 's " @entity104 " law , which gives a person facing a " presumption of fear of death or great bodily harm " extra protections should they respond with force instead of retreat			2
ultimately , @entity2 chose not to utilize that specific defense			1
the trial kicked off nearly two weeks ago with impassioned opening arguments			0
the prosecution suggested @entity2 , whom they painted as a neighborhood watch volunteer who overstepped his bounds , had " profiled " @entity3 because he was black			1
they called to the stand the 911 dispatcher who told @entity2 not to follow @entity3 , though he did anyway			1
then there were crime scene and autopsy photos			0
and of course , there was the testimony of @entity122 , who said she 'd been on the phone with her friend @entity3 in the minutes before his death			2
she testified that she 'd heard @entity3 call out , " why are you following me for ? " and then say , " get off , " before their call was cut off			1
@entity122 has been described as the defense 's star witness			2
that may still be true			0
but in many ways , friday was the most emotional and potentially pivotal day in the trial to date			0
@entity63 is n't disputing that latter assertion			0
he told @entity0 's @entity135 on friday night that " once the jury decides who was screaming for help ( on the 911 call ) , if they can , i think everything else falls in line			1
" speaking to @entity0 , @entity63 says he does n't dispute that @entity78 genuinely believes it was her son 's voice			1
but so does @entity22 of her own son , the defense lawyer says , arguing that " all the other evidence would suggest " that the screaming voice is indeed that of @entity2			1
and even if not everyone sees it that say , @entity63 opined , it 's possible each woman 's testimony may cancel each other out			0
opinion : can @entity2 win over the jurors ? " i think the jury is going to look at this and say both of these women just have to live with the belief that it is , in fact , their son , " @entity63 said			1
" and they are going to make a determination not based on what each mom says , but on the other evidence			0
" @entity170 , a lawyer for @entity3 's family , did n't entirely disagree -- telling @entity0 that he did n't think the case ultimately " is going to hinge on whose voice you 're hearing			1
" the six jurors , all women , will weigh both mother 's credibility , others ' testimony and a host of evidence			2
when all the testimony and presentations are over , @entity170 said , he expects they 'll agree on a verdict : guilty			0
he said , " at the end of the day , we do not believe that @entity2 had to pull out a gun and shoot @entity3 in the heart			1
" defense challenges medical examiner @entity19 and @entity22 were n't the only members of their respective families to take the stand friday			2
@entity78 , @entity3 's older brother , testified friday morning about the voice on the 911 call			1
the 22 - year - old college student said he was certain that it was his brother , even as he added that he had " heard him ( @entity3 ) yell " before , but " not like that			2
" hours later , it was @entity205 's turn			0
he testified right after @entity2 's mother			2
a deputy sheriff in @entity208 -- which is just south of @entity13 , both in @entity14 -- he 's also @entity2 's uncle			2
he said he originally heard the 911 call on tv and without any further information or prompts , immediately recognized his nephew 's voice			1
the other highlight of friday 's court proceedings was the testimony of @entity221 and @entity222 associate medical examiner @entity219			0
in @entity2 's trial , it 's a jury of millions @entity225 said the muzzle of @entity2 's gun was likely in loose contact with @entity3 's clothing , indicating that the teen was shot at close range			1
in testimony that at times turned contentious , @entity225 also said @entity3 did not die right away after the gunshot			2
" i believe he was alive for one to 10 minutes after he was shot			0
his heart was bleeding until there was no blood left , " the medical examiner said as autopsy photos lingered on a courtroom screen , adding that @entity3 was " suffering ( and ) in pain			0
" " there is no chance he could survive			0
" during a contentious cross-examination , defense attorney @entity244 expressed doubts about the condition of @entity3 's body and clothing when it was examined , noting the victim was not moved from the scene for about three hours			1
@entity225 would not confirm that timeline -- despite @entity244 's repeated attempts to have him do so -- because he said he was not there			0
as the two disputed @entity225 's ability to establish a timeline , judge @entity256 interjected , telling the witness to " please stop speaking so mr. @entity244 can ask the next question			0
" prepared notes that @entity225 was reading from also drew @entity244 's attention			0
when asked about them , @entity225 said , " i typed out potential answers to your potential questions			0
" @entity225 objected to sharing his notes , telling the judge that they were private and no one had seen them			0
despite his protests , @entity256 allowed the papers to be copied and reviewed by lawyers from both sides			0
the notes revealed that @entity225 had changed his mind about a couple of issues : the amount of time @entity3 survived after being shot and whether the marijuana in the teenager 's system was enough to affect him			2
@entity244 argued that the prosecution knew about these changes but did n't tell the defense			0
but @entity225 insisted that he did not tell anyone that he 'd changed his opinion			0
the defense attorney pressed @entity225 , too , on the collection of @entity3 's clothes and scraping of his fingernails			1
the medical examiner , though , said he could n't remember each detail and that he 'd trusted that his technicians properly followed procedures			0
late in friday 's court proceedings , @entity63 made his pitch for acquittal -- arguing that @entity2 acted in self - defense ; there was no direct evidence of ill will , hatred or spite surrounding @entity3 's killing ; and that it was still unclear who could be heard screaming on the 911 call			1
there is " no other reasonable hypothesis " for what happened , the defense attorney argued , besides self - defense			0
the judge , though , denied the motion -- after which , around 5 p.m. , the prosecution formally rested its case			0
@entity0 's @entity321 and @entity323 's @entity322 contributed to this report .			0

new : a defense lawyer says other evidence , not the 911 call , will determine the case
new : a lawyer for @entity3 's family says he thinks the jury will find @entity2 guilty
@entity22 says she knows the panicked voice is that of her son
earlier , @entity3 's *morther* said that it her son 's voice on the 911 call
