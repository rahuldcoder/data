-- @entity2 , a reputed former member of the @entity3 convicted in the 1964 abduction and killings of two @entity7 teenagers in @entity8 , has died in federal prison , the @entity1 said			1
@entity2 died on tuesday in the @entity10 at @entity11 , @entity12 , said bureau spokesman @entity13 , but he did not provide further details			2
a jury in 2007 convicted @entity2 , a former sheriff 's deputy , of kidnapping and conspiracy to commit kidnapping in the disappearances of @entity20 and @entity21 , both 19			1
the bodies of both youths were found in a backwater area of the @entity25			1
@entity2 was serving three life sentences			1
@entity2 was not tried for murder , but prosecutors alleged he and fellow @entity3 conspired to abduct , beat and murder @entity21 and @entity20 in may 1964			1
an indictment accused @entity2 and his cohorts of picking up the two men hitchhiking and driving them into the @entity33 in southwest @entity8 's @entity34 , where the teenagers were beaten and interrogated at gunpoint			1
@entity21 and @entity20 were then bound with duct tape , and weighted down by an engine block and a railroad rail , authorities said			0
the @entity41 alleged the two were still alive when they were thrown into the @entity43 , where they drowned			0
their decomposed bodies were found two months later during a search for three other missing civil rights workers -- a case that would later be known as the @entity48			2
the slayings were officially unsolved until @entity2 was indicted in 2007 , although he had been long suspected in the case			2
he and another man were arrested in 1964 , but released on bond and never tried			0
the @entity41 turned the case over to local authorities , and the investigation was dropped after a justice of the peace said witnesses had refused to testify			0
the case was revived in 2007 after @entity20 's brother , @entity60 , discovered @entity2 was still alive while visiting @entity34 , where he was helping research the case for a @entity64 documentary			1
@entity20 told @entity0 in january 2007 that he then gave the @entity66 attorney for the @entity67 the @entity41 files on the case , which he had obtained from a reporter			0
@entity66 attorney @entity71 helped form a task force that led to @entity2 's indictment			1
@entity2 was the first and only person convicted in the @entity20 and @entity21 case , the @entity74 has said			2
@entity2 's conviction was overturned , then reinstated , by federal appeals courts amid a legal battle over whether the statue of limitations had expired for his crimes			1
the battle wound up at the @entity66 @entity83 , which in november 2009 let stand a lower court ruling that the statute of limitations had not expired			0
in his appeal , @entity2 claimed the statute of limitations expired five years after the crime			2
the confusion arose out of the fact that kidnapping could be considered a capital offense in 1964 and had no time limit for prosecution			0
in 1968 , the high court eliminated the federal death penalty for that crime , and @entity99 changed the law to reflect that ruling four years later			0
but lawmakers in 1994 reinstated kidnapping as being death penalty eligible			0
@entity0 's @entity104 and @entity105 contributed to this report .			0
