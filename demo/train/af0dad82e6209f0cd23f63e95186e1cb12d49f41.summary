" she pitched her idea to factories and mills , asking them to help her make the product a reality , and of course , she was turned down again and again and again , " @entity2 recounted			1

" i want those stories to show you that there 's no magic to being successful in fashion or in anything else			0
what is required is a willingness to work long nights , to suffer through rejection and failure , to rise above all of that , all the doubts and fears and anxieties , whether you come from , you know , the city , the suburbs , no matter where you come from , all those feelings are natural , " @entity2 said .			2
