-- this month , the world 's political and business elite will converge on @entity4 's highest - altitude town for the annual talk - shop that is the @entity6 , held this year under the banner of " resilient dynamism			1
" the theme , the conference 's organizers make clear , is prescriptive rather than descriptive -- a clarion call to the world 's leaders , rather than an endorsement of their responses to date in addressing the problems afflicting the global economy			1
" the ... new reality that we face is a prolonged global economic malaise , particularly in major economies experiencing economic austerity , " @entity19 , the @entity20 economist who founded the @entity6 ( @entity6 ) in 1971 , said in a statement			1
" future growth in this new context requires dynamism -- bold vision and even bolder action			1
either attribute -- resilience or dynamism -- alone is insufficient			1
" while there has necessarily been plenty of resilience in evidence since the last time delegates gathered at the @entity44 ski resort , their responses to major issues like the ongoing eurozone sovereign debt crises and the @entity39 's fiscal cliff could hardly be termed dynamic			1
those issues are likely to be foremost in the minds of those deemed important enough to be admitted entrance to the event , considered one of the world 's most exclusive			1
attendance to @entity53 is strictly by invitation only , with only 2,600 " white badges " of attendance issued to representatives from more than 100 countries			1
adding to the exclusivity is the hefty price tag to attend			2
while the white badges are free for invited representatives of certain groups -- heads of state , faith leaders , academics , social entrepreneurs , members of international organizations and news anchors -- for businesses , the cost of a ticket is approximately $ 20,000			0
per - delegate costs can easily rise to double that once travel , accommodation and other expenses are factored in			0
among the @entity76 on the guest list will be heads of state , royalty , the @entity80 of global corporate giants and the heads of a veritable alphabet soup of international organizations			0
the delegates will have plenty to talk about			1
the @entity6 's own global risks 2013 report -- compiled from an annual survey of more than 1,000 experts and industry leaders -- offers a pessimistic outlook , saying the global community 's ability to address significant challenges , such as global warming , is undermined by the continuing economic weakness plaguing major economies			1
it identifies income inequality and unsustainable government debts as the two issues most likely to have an effect on the global community over the coming decade , and warns of a major systemic financial failure as the most devastating potential outcome			0
that weakness in key economic zones is proving stubbornly difficult to remedy			1
in november , figures were released showing the eurozone has entered a double - dip recession , with the well - documented woes of @entity113 , @entity114 , @entity115 , @entity116 and @entity117			0
austerity , the bitter medicine that it was hoped would be the cure to @entity4 's economic malaise , has not only proved hugely unpopular , prompting millions of @entity4 to take to the streets in coordinated mass protests in november -- it is also , in the eyes of many economic experts , not working			1
@entity131 managing director @entity130 is among many leading figures who have called for a slowdown in the austerity measures , the impacts of which the organization 's chief economist @entity128 has said were miscalculated			2
the only major respite for the eurozone has come courtesy of the " @entity139 effect			0
" in september , @entity140 ( @entity140 ) president , @entity139 , pledged to buy unlimited amounts of short - term debt from struggling eurozone members , in an attempt to shore up the 17 - nation currency bloc , provided they accept certain conditions			0
nevertheless the pain remains severe in many parts of @entity4 , with @entity113 in particular enduring the agony of austerity and recession			0
its economy is forecast to have contracted 6 % in 2012			0
meanwhile the prospect of a government bailout continues to hang over @entity114 , according to market watchers			0
compounding the uncertainty surrounding the eurozone 's fourth - largest economy is an upcoming referendum , to be held in 2014 , on whether @entity162 -- the country 's wealthiest and most industrialized region , containing 16 % of the population and producing 19 % of its wealth -- wants independence			2
elsewhere in @entity4 , economists are predicting that @entity168 -- which is not a member of the eurozone -- will receive a downgrading of its @entity173 rating this year			0
that was the result for the @entity39 , as it suffered the first ever downgrade of its @entity173 rating last year			0
despite lawmakers eventually reaching a deal on the fiscal cliff , political divisions look set to remain an impediment to addressing ongoing financial issues , such as the debt ceiling			2
the @entity39 's borrowing has hit its legal limit of $ 16.394 trillion , prompting the @entity186 to resort to " extraordinary measures " to ensure that the government can pay its bills			2
if the ceiling is not raised soon , the @entity39 faces the risk of defaulting on payments			0
but despite the painful , drawn - out experience of the fiscal cliff negotiations , indications from political leaders suggest that political partisanship and brinkmanship over financial solutions are set to continue			2
and in the @entity204 world , the ramifications of a wave of upheaval that began two years ago is still playing out			2
@entity205 -- the most populous @entity204 country , geopolitically significant for its relationship with @entity207 -- showed encouraging signs when it successfully held election for its first democratically elected leader			0
but president @entity212 's assumption of special powers -- a move described by critics as " dictatorial " -- to push through an @entity217 - framed constitution outraged secular and liberal groups , among others , triggering fresh waves of protest from @entity205 disenchanted with how the revolution had played out			2
the renewed unrest has scared investors , prompting a fresh round of selling of the @entity205 pound , which has hit a series of record lows			0
his constitution passed , @entity212 now faces an economic battle : to tackle his country 's low foreign reserves , 12 % unemployment and a large budget deficit , and revive this geopolitically significant @entity237 economy			1
the question here , as elsewhere , remains whether 2013 can truly represent a new dawn -- or whether delegates will return to their snowy enclave in @entity53 in 2014 to address the same set of intractable problems .			1
