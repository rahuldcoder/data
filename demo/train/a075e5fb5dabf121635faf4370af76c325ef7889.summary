-- @entity1 hungry for feel - good fine dining are reaping the benefits of the struggling economy			1
606 @entity5 in @entity6 , @entity7 , is offering a three - course " appetite stimulus " deal for $ 25			1
wine deals , bar menu specials and three - course , prix fixe meals for $ 25 to $ 40 are popping up in high - end eateries across the country to lure customers as business and leisure travel dips and diners stay closer to home and make more value - driven decisions about eating out			1
for @entity28 restaurateur @entity27 , sticking to good food and the warm , hospitable philosophy of his @entity24 restaurant , @entity26 , is key to devising dining promotions to combat a 20 percent dip in business from the same period last year			0
" every restaurant out there is leading with the discount , and the consumer -- it 's become one big blur			0
we 're all competing against each other -- none of us are coming out winners , " @entity27 said			0
to differentiate @entity26 this winter , @entity27 and the restaurant 's chef created five winter soups available at the bar for $ 5 each , paired with $ 5 glasses of sherry			2

@entity26 's @entity47 , a rustic $ 35 three - course , prix fixe meal featuring entrees such as braised lamb shank , is another offer aimed at budget - conscious diners			1
" a year ago , to be honest , i did n't have to hit that three - course menu at $ 35 a head			1
now you have to , " @entity27 said			0
@entity27 said he hopes the special menu items and prix fixe offering will attract more neighborhood diners to @entity26 , one of the most expensive restaurants in the @entity24			1
" you need that neighborhood crowd , and because of our price point , maybe not everyone in the @entity24 was able to come to @entity26			0
well , we need to change that , " @entity27 said			0
taking menu price inflation into account , the @entity67 expects the restaurant industry 's sales to decline by 1 percent in 2009			0
a similar drop in 2008 makes for the first consecutive back - to - back decline for the industry since the organization started tracking sales in 1970			2
" this is currently the most challenging environment for restaurant operators in several decades , " said @entity77 , head of research at the @entity67			0
while the decline is relatively small compared with other industries , pricier restaurants take a bigger hit in a down economy , and establishments that rely heavily on travelers are likely to feel the economic slump acutely as total travel expenditures in the @entity1 are expected to dip by 6.7 percent in 2009 , according to the @entity89			1
at national seafood chain @entity90 , 35 percent to 40 percent of the customer traffic , on average , comes from business travelers , according to ceo @entity95			2

the restaurant is offering a steak and lobster dinner with dessert for $ 29.95			1
increased focus on local promotional opportunities around holidays such as @entity105 and @entity106 and an enhanced preferred guest program also are part of the company 's efforts to drive sales			0
the preferred guest program allows diners to amass points that can be redeemed for food in the restaurant and some travel - related awards			1
in @entity118 , @entity119 , where many upscale restaurants rely heavily on tourism , those that are coping best are adding value without compromising their price integrity , according to @entity124 , an assistant professor in the @entity118 's @entity125			1
" rather than lowering their prices or offering coupons and discounts that are inconsistent with fine dining , they 're trying to give [ customers ] a better value			0
perhaps where they were priced a la carte before , now it might be more of a prix fixe menu , " @entity124 said			1
the @entity138 , in the @entity137 , started a dinner at dusk promotion in january			0
the three - course menu for $ 39 is available seven days a week to diners who are seated before 6 p.m. similar value - driven promotions are available at other hotel - based restaurants			1
606 @entity5 , in the @entity146 in @entity7 , will resume a popular " appetite stimulus " menu on april 13			0
for $ 25 , guests receive an appetizer , entr√©e special , dessert and a glass of wine			1
wine promotions are another customer lure			0

the promotion finished a successful @entity164 run at the end of february , and the company is now waiving corkage fees at most @entity164 restaurants			2
" that is something that has been wildly successful ... just getting people in the door , " said spokeswoman @entity169			0
" we figure if people do n't need to pay for wine , they 'll spend more on food			0
" promotions and sales declines aside , @entity1 are still dining out , according to @entity77 of the @entity67			2
" restaurants have become so ingrained in @entity1 lifestyles now , and the consumer reliance upon them in some cases deems it a much more essential experience than a discretionary experience			1
