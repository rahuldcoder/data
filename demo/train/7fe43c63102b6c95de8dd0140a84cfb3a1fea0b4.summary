five years ago , the @entity0 were living the @entity3 dream			0
the family had moved into a new home in @entity6 , and @entity8 's business was taking off			1
he had started a company called @entity10 that sold waterfalls , and online orders were strong			0
@entity8 connected with @entity13 , who manufactured custom indoor waterfalls			1
... he came down and had dinner with me and my family once or twice a week virtually every week , " @entity13 told @entity1 's @entity16			1
" @entity8 was my best friend			1
" it 's a surprising statement considering where @entity13 is now -- behind bars , charged with murder in the deaths of @entity24 ; his wife , @entity26 ; and their two small children , @entity29 and @entity8 the last time anyone heard from the @entity8 family was february 4 , 2010			1
for years , no one knew what happened to them			0
police who searched their home days after the family disappeared found eggs on the kitchen counter and bowls of popcorn in the living room , along with the family 's two dogs			1
there were no signs of a struggle			0
the bodies of the @entity8 family were found in the @entity50 in november 2013			1
police say they believe the family died of " blunt force trauma			0
" @entity13 , who is now representing himself , has pleaded not guilty			1
a preliminary hearing has been set for april 7			0
no trial date has been scheduled yet			0
but investigators are confident they have the right man			0
from the start of the case , @entity59 detectives had their eyes on @entity13 , a talented welder who was known for his laid - back , cowboy demeanor			1
@entity8 's father , @entity64 , teamed up with @entity65 , who knew his son through work			1
the two did their own investigating and came across what they say are some troubling inconsistencies			0
@entity13 has said he was the last person to see @entity24 alive			1
the two , @entity13 said , met for a business lunch in @entity73 the day the family disappeared			1
" i am definitely the last person he saw , " @entity13 told @entity16 in january 2014			1
asked if @entity8 was concerned about anything , @entity13 said , " no , no , no. he seemed happy			1
" but @entity78 told @entity1 that @entity13 told him @entity8 was upset about a damaged fountain @entity13 built for him			1
@entity8 also told his father he was frustrated with @entity13 's work			1
" @entity82 had talked about the quality of some of the fountains had slipped			0
and @entity82 was n't happy with that , " @entity78 said			0
" because he was getting complaints			0
" @entity8 had talked to his father about getting another welder			2
@entity13 also told @entity1 about receiving a call from @entity8 the night he disappeared			1
@entity13 said he did n't remember the call until his then - girlfriend reminded him about it			2
the call came , he said , when they were watching television			0
@entity13 picked up the phone , looked at it and set it back down			2
he was tired , he said			0
but when @entity78 asked about the call , @entity13 said it was a follow - up to their conversation at lunch			2
@entity59 district attorney @entity103 said he ca n't yet say what the motive was , but he said his team had been watching @entity13 on a daily basis			2
" we know there have been many inconsistencies , " @entity103 said			0
" his story is all over the place			2
" still , the case against @entity13 may have holes			2
@entity13 told @entity1 he went to the @entity24 house after the family went missing and before it was sealed off			1
officers believe the @entity0 were killed in the home , but 11 days passed between the family 's disappearance and an alert to the sheriff 's department			2
it took @entity126 investigators three days to obtain the warrants they needed to complete a full search , and during that time , the home remained unsealed			0
how reliable is evidence gathered at the @entity24 house so many days after investigators say the family was killed there ? could one person kill a family of four and bury the bodies 100 miles away ? and the fact that it has been five years since the family went missing does not make the prosecution 's case any easier			2
" i think the biggest obstacle ... is time			0
because witnesses forget , people forget the time frames , what occurred , etc. , " @entity103 said .			0

@entity13 has pleaded not guilty to four counts of murder
bodies of @entity8 were found in the *desert* in 2013
prior to his arrest , @entity13 *shared* his story with @entity1 's @entity16
