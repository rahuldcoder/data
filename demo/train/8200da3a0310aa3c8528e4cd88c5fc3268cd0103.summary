@entity0 -- is it a model for bipartisan governance or a short - term solution that only hardened long - held positions ? democrats and @entity8 had wildly different takes on thursday on the agreement passed by @entity10 and signed by president @entity11 that ended the 16 - day partial shutdown of the government and averted a possible @entity15 default			1
hundreds of thousands of federal workers returned to their jobs across the country and national monuments such as the @entity21 in @entity22 reopened under the agreement considered a victory for @entity11 because it lacked substantive changes to his signature health care reforms targeted by conservatives			2
in a tough and somber statement , the president challenged the @entity8 right to drop its anti-government ideology and change how business gets done in @entity0			1
the standoff " inflicted completely unnecessary damage ( to ) our economy " by slowing growth and increasing borrowing costs , @entity11 said , declaring that " there are no winners here			2
" at the same time , he blamed the brinksmanship that flirted with the first default in @entity15 history on no - compromise tactics of the @entity8 tea party wing in @entity10 , saying that " the @entity15 people are completely fed up with @entity0			2
" " let 's work together to make government work better instead of treating it like an enemy or purposely making it work worse , " @entity11 said in a direct jab at tea party conservatives			1
" you do n't like a particular policy or a particular president ? then argue for your position			2
go out there and win an election , " he added			0
" push to change it , but do n't break it " because " that 's not being faithful to what this country 's about			2
" saying " we ca n't degenerate into hatred , " he ended by quoting part of the @entity69 that states @entity15 is " one nation , under @entity70 , indivisible , with liberty and justice for all			1
" but an aide to sen. @entity75 , who led the @entity77 charge to tie continued government funding to derailing @entity79 , told @entity1 's @entity80 late on thursday the @entity81 @entity8 was not ruling anything in or out about a possible shutdown early next year around the next big fiscal deadlines			1
while no other @entity8 leaders offered on - the - record reaction , a senior @entity8 congressional aide told @entity88 that " the president 's comments are not designed to help this process , only to lay blame in advance " of upcoming congressional battles over the budget , immigration reform and other issues			1
the congressional stalemate ended when @entity8 caved to the insistence of @entity11 and @entity100 that legislation funding the government and raising the federal borrowing limit should be free -- or at least mostly free -- from partisan issues and tactics			1
after all the bickering and grandstanding , the billions lost and trust squandered , the result amounted to much ado about nothing			0
hardline @entity8 , whose opposition to @entity11 's signature health care reforms set the shutdown and debt ceiling crisis in motion , got pretty much zip -- except maybe marred reputations			1
" to say we as @entity8 left a lot on the table would be one of the biggest understatements in @entity15 political history , " @entity120 sen. @entity120 of @entity121 tweeted			2
the agreement amounted to the cliched kicking of the can down the road , because the deal passed by @entity10 in lightning fashion wednesday night and signed by @entity11 in the wee hours of thursday only funds the government through january 15 and raises the debt ceiling until february 7			1
read the bill it also set up budget negotiations between the @entity8 - led @entity139 and @entity100 - led @entity140 intended to reach a broader agreement on funding the government for the fiscal year that ends on september 30			1
ideally , a budget compromise would ensure government funding and include deficit reduction provisions that would prevent another round of default - threatening brinksmanship in three months ' time			2
dialogue started on thursday , leaders of the @entity139 and @entity140 budget committees -- @entity8 rep. @entity154 of @entity155 and @entity100 sen. @entity156 of @entity0 -- held a symbolic breakfast to get the dialogue started			2
they noted that their negotiations -- called a conference between their two committees to work out differences in budgets passed by each chamber -- differed from a special committee set up under 2011 legislation that failed to agree on broader deficit reduction steps			0
" chairman @entity154 knows i 'm not gon na vote for his budget			0
i know that he 's not gon na vote for mine , " @entity171 told reporters , saying the goal was to find " the common ground between our two budgets that we both can vote on			0
" in his statement to reporters thursday , @entity11 repeated his call for @entity10 to now take a " balanced approach " on a budget for the rest of the current fiscal year that would " cut out things we do n't need , " " close corporate tax loopholes that do n't create jobs , " and " free up resources for things that do help the country grow , " like research and infrastructure			1
he also said @entity10 should pass immigration reforms proposed by the @entity140 and complete work on a farm bill caught in partisan wrangling			0
@entity139 spokesman @entity198 said the @entity139 vote to pass the spending and debt ceiling agreement wednesday showed the possibility of bipartisan governance , with the @entity100 minority joined by enough @entity8 to surpass the 217 - vote threshold required			1
however , that outcome only came under immense pressure on @entity208 after their partisan proposals seeking to link provisions dismantling or defunding @entity79 were rejected by the @entity100 - led @entity140 and the president			2
house speaker @entity214 's spokesman said the @entity215 @entity8 sought a " step - by - step " process to address the immigration issue , which was @entity0 code for rejecting @entity11 's comprehensive approach that would offer immigrants living illegally in the country a pathway to legal status			1
conservatives call that amnesty , and a senior @entity8 aide told @entity1 that " the president 's attitude and actions over the past few weeks have almost certainly poisoned the well on immigration , at least for now			1
" why is @entity75 smiling ? back to work before @entity11 spoke thursday , federal employees returning to work got muffins from vice president @entity235 and hugs from colleagues , along with eye rolls about their " vacation " due to the shutdown			1
" i am happy it 's ended , " @entity235 said when he arrived at the @entity241 with the muffins handed out to returning workers			0
" it was unnecessary to begin with			0
" in the basement of the @entity248 , there were exuberant hugs as furloughed colleagues were welcomed back , but there was also bitterness toward the elected legislators in charge upstairs			0
a common refrain was the sarcastic question : " how was your vacation ? " responses were often nonverbal -- an eye roll , a head shake , an angry glare , the occasional ironic laugh			0
@entity262 : conservatives should lighten up had @entity10 not approved a debt limit increase , the government would have lost its authority to borrow more money to pay all of its bills			2
@entity270 checks and veterans ' benefits could have stopped			0
the markets could have gone into a tailspin			0
approval of the temporary spending plan meant the return to work of more than 800,000 furloughed employees , while more than 1 million others who 've been working without pay will get paychecks again			0
a provision in the agreement guaranteed back pay for government workers for the shutdown			2
what 's open for business again last - minute save however , the measure does n't address many of the contentious and complicated issues that continue to divide @entity100 and @entity8 , such as changes to entitlement programs and tax reform			1
" we think that we 'll be back here in january debating the same issues , " @entity294 , managing director of @entity296 's rating service , told @entity1 on wednesday night			0
" this is , i fear , a permanent feature of our budgetary process			0
" at the @entity139 , @entity198 hoped the outcome of the shutdown showdown -- with republicans getting little in return for the public anger leveled mostly at them for causing it -- would revise how things worked			0
" it 's a new day , and maybe that dynamic will change , " he said			0
@entity140 @entity8 leader @entity312 of @entity313 , credited with brokering the agreement with his @entity100 counterpart , majority leader @entity315 of @entity316 , said in published interviews thursday there would be no further government shutdowns			1
pork in the bill : the 5 most surprising provisions in the debt deal a $ 24 billion battle the partial government shutdown came at a steep cost			1
@entity296 's estimated it took a $ 24 billion bite out of the economy			0
then there 's the impact it had on politicians ' image			0
if there 's one thing polls showed that @entity15 agreed on , it 's that they do n't trust @entity10 -- with republicans bearing more blame than anyone else for what transpired			0
what did @entity8 win on @entity79 ? not much while some republicans , such as tea party favorite @entity75 , claimed moral victories in energizing their movement , @entity214 did n't even pretend his side came out victorious			1
" we fought the good fight ; we just did n't win , " @entity214 told a radio station in his home state of @entity215			0
@entity75 , despite being in the @entity140 , is credited with spearheading the @entity139 @entity8 effort to attach amendments that would have dismantled or defunded @entity79			1
republicans did get a small @entity79 concession : requiring the government to confirm the eligibility of people receiving federal subsidies under the health care program			0
however , @entity8 leaders said dismantling or defunding @entity79 was never going to happen and they criticized @entity75 and his tea party cohorts for essentially causing the unpopular shutdown over that effort			1
@entity8 sen. @entity364 of @entity365 called the @entity75 tactic " an ill - conceived strategy from the beginning , not a winning strategy			1
" how the @entity139 voted how the @entity140 voted ' never again ' former house speaker @entity370 predicts the tea party and staunch conservatives in the @entity8 will be more energized after not getting the @entity374 amendments they wanted			2
" they will be more embittered , more angry			0
they will find more ways to go after @entity11 because they ca n't find any way to get him to negotiate , " he said , adding that he expects @entity79 to become the defining issue of the next two elections cycles			1
key points of the new debt deal @entity1 's @entity385 , @entity386 , @entity80 , @entity387 , @entity388 , @entity389 , @entity390 , @entity391 , @entity392 , @entity393 , @entity394 , @entity395 and @entity396 contributed to this report .			0
