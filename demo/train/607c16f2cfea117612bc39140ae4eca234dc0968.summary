at the dawn of the 20th century , @entity0 wanted to save the world from fuel dependency			1
now , an internet cartoonist wants to save @entity0 's last remaining laboratory as a tribute to the futurist inventor			1
the structure , a 94 - by - 94 - foot building , was the location where @entity0 hoped to develop wireless communications and clean , free energy for everyone in the early 1900s			1
he moved his operation to the @entity16 in @entity17 , @entity18 , in 1902 -- so named because of a 187 - foot tower rising from the ground ( as well as being sunk 120 feet below it ) that was to be one of the great transmitters for his wireless energy dream			1
the facility was lost a few years later due to debts @entity0 racked up , and the huge tower was demolished in 1917			1
the site would ultimately become a @entity29 location because of silver and cadmium toxicity in the ground after a photographic film company used it for nearly 48 years			0
it has now been cleaned up and is no longer harmful			0
@entity0 died penniless and in debt in 1943			1
currently , the building and surrounding land sit idle and are up for sale			0
@entity40 , the creator of web cartoon " @entity40 , " is joining forces with a nonprofit group , the @entity44 at @entity16 , to help preserve the facility as a science center and museum honoring " the father of the electric age			1
" ' @entity51 ' star examines real weird science " @entity0 is an unsung hero , and there are very few monuments to him in the @entity56			1
i feel like that 's something we need to fix , " @entity57 said			0
" i made a comic about @entity0 on my site			1
it got the most ' likes ' on @entity63 that i 've ever seen in my career			0
@entity65 ( the fact ) that i 've got this army of @entity0 fans and the experience and success with my other fund - raiser , i felt like i was the ideal person to step in to control			1
" @entity57 's previous experience with the @entity74 crowdfunding site stemmed from a potential lawsuit and his subsequent campaign to raise money for the @entity78 and the @entity79			1
this current effort , bluntly titled " @entity44 , " exploded after it was launched , raising more than $ 750,000 within five days			1
it had topped $ 792,000 as of tuesday morning			2
the goal was to raise enough money to buy the property and begin efforts to restore the facility			0
the asking price is $ 1.6 million , and @entity57 's goal of $ 850,000 would be matched by a @entity18 state grant for the same amount , raising a total of $ 1.7 million			1
@entity57 said he was shocked by how much , and how quickly , people have donated to save @entity0 's lab. " what i expected to happen was we 'd raise 20 or 30 grand and trickle over for the next six weeks			2
i did n't expect to average $ 27,000 per hour ( in the first few days ) , " he said			2
" @entity57 used the power of social media and drew from his 700,000 fans on @entity63 , 300,000 followers on @entity102 and over 1 million followers on @entity104 to get his campaign rolling			2
he 's also asked the @entity106 , co-founded by @entity0 rival @entity107 , to contribute , and received a " modest amount " from @entity108 , co-founder of @entity109 and @entity110			2
the site quickly sold out of donation perks , items people could receive for their gift			0
so the campaign created new perks , using @entity0 's love of the number 3 in the amount			1
" @entity0 , for the past year or two on the @entity121 , has risen as a cult hero to geek people , " @entity57 said			2
" i think a lot of people are donating , not to say how noble they are , but are willing to support him			0
" @entity16 was the last official laboratory where @entity0 worked			1
@entity128 , president of the @entity44 , said he moved into offices in @entity18 later , but @entity16 was his final experimental location			2
that fact , along with his efforts to develop green energy , is why the site holds special significance			2
" @entity0 viewed the @entity136 as a generator of electricity			2
he believed that each of the planets resonates , " @entity128 explained			0
" if you could tap into that resonance , you would be able to tap into the energy that is in the @entity136 and you could bounce it off the ionosphere to any other place on the globe			0
" read more space and science news on @entity151 's @entity150 blog designed by @entity153 , a pre-eminent architect at the time , the square brick building was originally split down the middle , creating two large rectangular rooms for experiments			0
the tall tower and the overturned bowl at the top loomed over the countryside , and started out as a transmitter of messages while @entity0 turned his thoughts and creativity toward global energy			1
" @entity0 foresaw the wireless transmissions we do with our cell phones and our laptops , " @entity128 said			1
" he said there would come a day when people would send pictures , messages , words from one place to another without wires			0
" the inventor convinced banker and philanthropist @entity182 of how beneficial such wireless communication would be to business and received financial backing for his project			1
but after @entity187 sent his radio signal across the @entity189 in 1901 , @entity182 pulled his funding			0
eventually , the property was lost in 1915 -- to pay off a debt to @entity193 of the @entity194 -- before @entity0 could realize his dream of free electricity for everyone			2
the @entity56 government destroyed the tower in 1917 , fearing @entity201 spies were using it to send messages during @entity204 the property changed hands a couple more times and is currently owned by @entity208 , a technology company based in @entity209			0
the company put the property up for sale in 2009 and got an offer from a potential buyer who wanted to develop the land			0
that created a sense of urgency for @entity128 's group , which has been working for nearly 17 years to preserve it			0
" when we heard that , and there was a letter of interest with a price involved , all of that made us a little bit wary and concerned because someone could come along and purchase this property before we had an opportunity to make an offer , " she said			0
" but we did n't have the money to make an offer			0
" she said her group made a plea on the internet to the people involved , which attracted the attention of @entity57			0
he reached out to @entity128 to offer his online influence and experience to the effort			0
@entity128 said the money raised by the @entity74 campaign would just purchase the property and facility , not finance the cleanup or restoration of the building into a museum			1
if the group is successful in its bid , she expects it will be a couple of years before the museum opens , while additional funding and exhibits are arranged			0
