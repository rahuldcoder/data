-- stumped on a tough decision ? new web sites are there to help			1
@entity5 , a site open to the public monday , asks questions and helps people make decisions			1
@entity5 , a site that launches for the public monday , will consider your quandary by getting to know you , asking you a series of questions and then spitting out three decisions			1
another site , @entity16 , makes a similar attempt			1
@entity18 , co-founder of the photo - sharing community @entity21 , says she created @entity5 not because people need help with emotional decisions but because it 's too tough to find smart information online			1
you often have to replicate someone else 's research , which is a waste , she said			1
tech bloggers seem to be pleased with the effort			0
" for the most part , i was impressed , though it quickly became clear that @entity5 is n't capable of magically making up your mind for you , " wrote @entity31 , a reporter at @entity32 , a technology blog			1
he called the site " very clean and unintimidating			1
" @entity18 spoke with @entity0 about decision making , her nerdy past and the power of collective knowledge			1
the following is an edited transcript : @entity0 : where did you get the idea for @entity5 ? fake : it 's a user - generated content site similar to @entity21 , but the unit is not a photograph but a decision			1
and so it 's sort of a similar thing in that way			2
we kind of built the system so people can contribute to it			0
they can ask questions on there and suggest questions			2
and then you sort of codify it into a decision tree			0
@entity0 : so you 're answering questions about yourself ? fake : well , there are two components			1
so you answer questions about yourself , and there 's a little module that says things like , " alien abductions : real or fake ? " and what [ @entity5 ] does is , it then puts together a profile of you , a taste profile			1
and then you can go into the system and ask it any question that 's in the system			2
so it 's things like , " @entity85 should i buy ? " or " where should i go to college ? " or , you know , " where should i eat in @entity90 on a saturday night ? " it could be just about anything			2
once it kind of gets to know you , you can ask it questions , and then it gives an answer to you that it does n't give to anyone else			2
@entity0 : what are the downsides ? fake : it depends on what the decision is			1
there is kind of an array of decisions that are too taste - oriented			2
like , no matter how well we know you , we 're not going to know that your backyard is like 25 feet by 10 feet , versus 10 feet by 10 feet [ for a person looking to buy a backyard grill ]			0
you know what i 'm saying ? there 's no system that can get to know that			2
so what we try to do is narrow it down			0
so we ask you questions about your aesthetics or your beliefs or your politics or your demographic			2
@entity0 : what kind of decision - maker are you ? fake : it 's really funny , because i think there 's a mistake that 's generally made with people asking about @entity5 , and it 's that it 's solving people 's emotional problems			1
it 's solving people 's informational problems			1
i do n't have any problems making any decisions			1
i 've never had any problem making decisions , but when i go to @entity141 and i 'm looking for information , say , about trademarks			2
i have to do all this research , and somebody has already done this research			0
@entity0 : so you see @entity5 as a kind of search engine , almost ? fake : no , it 's not a search engine			1
the feel of it is nothing like a search engine			0
@entity0 : how do you think collective knowledge online will change the way people live , or the way we interact with each other ? fake : it 's like it 's an amazing period in the history of the internet just in that way			1
... we know more in the collective than we do in the individual			1
it becomes even more amazing when you extend that out to people outside your social network			0
like , i do n't know anyone that has taken a yoga class in @entity181			0
but i 'm sure that if i ended up in @entity181 , and i wanted to sign up for a yoga class that somebody in the world would know three places to recommend me			0
the information is out there in a sort of disorganized fashion			0
... these systems that are kind of growing up now -- and @entity5 hopefully is among them -- are able to take this sort of collective knowledge and make it easy for people to use and easy for people to access			1
@entity0 : is there anything in your background that influences your belief in this collective knowledge idea ? fake : i was a nerdy little girl			1
i played @entity204 , and i had a little @entity206 computer			0
it was really early on , i think it was , gosh , like 1994 when i first saw the @entity209 , right ? so i went online , and i saw these people uploading pictures of , like , their cats			0
and i remember there was a video cam of ... the famous coffee pot at the @entity217 research center that uploaded every 5 minutes to show that the coffee pot was full or empty or whatever			0
and so the @entity219 struck me as this incredible thing where anybody -- like anybody -- could publish anything , and then anybody anywhere else in the world could read it			0
and i never got over that			0
there was kind of this wonder , this sense of wonder that i had about this incredible culture of generosity on the @entity209 -- of all these people sharing stuff with each other			0
i 've always been so amazed by that			0
like , i love that aspect of the @entity219			0
that 's the thing that always seemed like it was magic to me			2
@entity0 : what are some cool web sites that are flying under the radar right now ? fake : have you heard of @entity244 ? @entity0 : yeah , is that where people buy and sell art ? fake : yeah , it 's great			1
i think it 's gon na be like the next @entity251			2
and i met those guys when they were really small			0
i 've been helping those guys since it was three kids in a dorm room			0
it 's one of my favorite companies			0
it has that same kind of ethic [ as @entity5 ] : the power of the individual			1
there are like these housewives in the @entity268 who had no idea they could make a living making @entity272 ornaments or whatever			0
it 's just kind of an amazing thing that can only happen on the @entity219 .			0

@entity0 talks with @entity18 , founder of a web site that makes decisions
@entity5 asks you questions and then suggests answers
fake says @entity5 works best for informational problems , not emotional dilemmas
@entity18 's *philosophy* : " we know more in the collective than we do in the individual "
