@entity0 lost another round in its effort to restrict abortions when the @entity5 @entity4 tuesday declined to hear an appeal in a case that would force women seeking an abortion to have an ultrasound first			1
the justices , without comment , refused to accept the state 's appeal over @entity15 , which would require healthcare providers to perform an ultrasound scan before terminating a woman 's pregnancy			1
lower state courts found the law unconstitutional			0
@entity0 attorney general @entity22 said those judges did not give proper legal weight to previous high court rulings allowing some regulation and restriction on abortions			2
the new law mandated that pregnant women seeking an abortion be given the chance to view the ultrasound image and be given a medical description , including " the dimensions of the embryo or fetus , the presence of cardiac activity , if present and viewable , and the presence of external members and internal organs , if present and viewable			2
" neither the woman nor her doctor would be punished or penalized if she refused to look at those images , but the procedure , performed either vaginally or abdominally , and the explanation would be required			0
state lawmakers supporting the legislation said the ultrasound requirement was designed to allow women to make an " informed decision " before undergoing an abortion			0
abortion rights groups objected to the @entity0 statute			1
" @entity0 's unusual law imposes serious burdens on a woman 's decision whether to terminate a pregnancy , " said the @entity55 , which filed a brief urging the @entity4 to stay out of the case			1
" it is difficult to imagine a requirement more physically invasive than the state - mandated insertion of a medical device into one 's body even when the patient and the doctor think it unnecessary			0
" the @entity5 high court last week dismissed an @entity0 appeal on a separate state law limiting abortions performed with medicine instead of surgery			1
that law would have regulated the ability of doctors to prescribe a medication regime -- using @entity84 pills -- to terminate early pregnancies , and make it a crime to deviate from the federal government - approved dosage and time limits on the drugs			0
but many physicians , backed by abortion rights supporters , say they routinely induce medical abortions through a combination of drugs they determine is simpler , safer , and less expensive than the current federal protocols on the use of abortion drugs			0
this was the first of several restrictive abortion laws nationwide to get a recent review by the @entity4			1
a federal appeals court last month allowed a similar law from @entity107 on medical abortions to go into effect			2
but a coalition of abortion rights groups immediately asked the @entity4 for an emergency injunction to block that law 's enforcement			1
the justices could rule on that request as soon as tuesday			2
the @entity0 ultrasound case is @entity22 v. @entity118 ( 12 - 1170 )			0
the pending @entity107 case is @entity119 v. @entity121 , @entity107 attorney general ( @entity122 ) .			0

this is the second abortion law @entity0 has had shot down recently
the @entity4 justices refused to hear the appeal on *sonagram* requirement
justices could rule soon on injunction request for @entity107 abortion law
