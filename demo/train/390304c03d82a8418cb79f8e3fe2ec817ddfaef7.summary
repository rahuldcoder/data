-- every @entity2 community has its borders			1
@entity5 , for example , has @entity6			2
it divides , in a squishy and always - changing sort of way , @entity10 , the poorest neighborhood on the island , from the @entity13 , which is among the wealthiest			1
stand on the street and you 'll see people crossing from one world to the other in both directions			2
but the boundary does have real meaning for some			2
this summer , i met @entity24 , a young father and college student who was living in one of the public housing projects in @entity10			2
he told me he once took a girlfriend on a date on the @entity13			0
the questioning stares of richer @entity31 tainted the experience			0
his date 's interest in window shopping did n't help either			0
across 96th , he felt different			0
@entity36 was made to feel that way			0
the river , the highway , the tracks			0
all of these unspoken lines have shaped @entity2 consciousness			1
this is increasingly true in the age of income inequality			0
as the gap between rich and poor continues to grow , so does the gulf in understanding between the classes			1
we 're not helped by the fact that , as @entity55 's @entity54 put it to me , the ends of the income spectrum are mostly invisible			0
we do n't see billionaires picking up their morning papers			0
the extremely poor are among the most stigmatized groups in the @entity2			1
we see past them , as one man who works in @entity62 , the ritzy - poor @entity5 neighborhood , told me recently			1
we pretend they 're not there , that these divisions do n't exist in the richest country in the world			0
maybe one way to help shrink the gap between rich and poor , then , is simply to stare these divisions right in the face -- to remind ourselves that these boundaries were created and can be erased			1
to that end , i 'd like to invite you to participate in a collaborative storytelling experiment called " @entity78			0
" here 's how to participate : 1			0
take a photo of something that divides your community			1
upload the image to @entity84 or to an online social network			1
include the hashtag # crossthegap with your submission			1
in the caption , write why this particular thing -- it could be a highway , a sign , a language barrier , a park , a building , whatever -- divides your community			1
say a little bit about yourself or your hometown			0
which side of the gap do you inhabit ? and what could you do to help make that barrier less formal or significant ? i 'll give a few examples to help clear things up			1
in @entity107 , where i used to live , the @entity108 and @entity109 broadly split the community in two			2
everyone asks whether you 're from the north side or the south			2
the social circles are pretty different			2
in @entity116 , @entity117 , where i traveled recently to report a story on income inequality , a beautiful , cypress - lined lake largely separates rich from poor			1
and @entity31 is a maze of shifting and unspoken dividers			0
go to @entity62 and you 'll find blocks where the rich and poor stare at each other out of their windows			1
i 'm excited to see what you come up with for this assignment			0
as you take the photos , i 'd ask you to think about the economic and cultural forces that keep us apart -- and what each of us could do to bring everyone , regardless of income , closer together			0
the opinions expressed in this column are solely those of @entity142 .			1

the rich - poor gap in the @entity2 has been *widening* since the *1970s*
@entity146 asks *readers* to help *narrow* the gap
@entity142 : take a photo of something that divides your community
upload the images to @entity84 or to social networks with the hashtag # crossthegap
