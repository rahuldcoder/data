-- @entity2 's highest court wednesday upheld a judge 's earlier decision to grant a stay of execution for a man who says the person he killed had sexually abused him years earlier			1
the court 's decision denied prosecutors an emergency petition to have @entity13 , 46 , put to death on wednesday , though the court could decide at a later point to have the execution go forward			1
" as the @entity23 has now confirmed , @entity21 ( @entity20 ) @entity19 's grant of a stay was factually and legally sound , " said attorney @entity17			0
" the @entity25 district attorney 's office should stop its pursuit to execute @entity27			0
" no one disputes that @entity13 beat @entity29 to death with a tire iron in 1984 or that he should be in prison			1
but his defense team says information that @entity29 had allegedly sexually abused @entity13 was withheld from the trial , and his life should be spent in a cell			1
attorneys ask @entity2 judge to call off killer 's execution , citing sex abuse last week , @entity19 , a common pleas court judge in @entity25 , found " reasonable probability " that the verdict might have been different had allegations of abuse surfaced during the initial case and that the relationship between the two men had been established but not disclosed			1
his attorneys have argued that the jurors who convicted @entity13 more than 25 years ago were told that it was a robbery - homicide case and never learned of the abuse allegations			1
@entity25 district attorney @entity55 filed an emergency appeal , and has called the abuse allegations hearsay and " a last - ditch effort to escape punishment			1
" @entity13 , the district attorney , said that although the high court denied the immediate review of the case , the ruling means the case would now proceed as a normal appeal			1
" the @entity23 will now have the time to look at all the facts , " the district attorney said in a statement			0
" i continue to believe that this defendant received an appropriate sentence and that his new claims are not true			0
" @entity13 and accomplice @entity75 led @entity76 , 56 , to an area near a cemetery , forced him to lie on the ground , tied him up , gagged him and stole his valuables , the governor 's office said in a statement			2
" @entity13 and @entity75 repeatedly beat the man with a tire iron and a socket wrench and then drove away in the victim 's car			2
@entity13 later returned and burned @entity29 's body , " the statement said			2
@entity75 is serving a life sentence			0
since the execution date was set , a number of high - profile supporters have called for clemency in the case , including @entity2 attorney general @entity95			2
more than 360,000 people have signed an online petition asking authorities to spare @entity13 ' life			2
@entity29 's widow has also asked for the execution to be called off			0
but @entity29 's daughter wants the execution to go forward , the @entity25 district attorney 's office said			0
she said friday that accusations of sexual abuse were false and asked the court to uphold the death penalty			0
