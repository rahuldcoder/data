one of the most common questions a pregnant woman gets asked : " is this your first ? " — suggesting there were more or will be more			0
but how many children you choose to have has a fundamental influence on your capacity to juggle the 21st century work - life balance			1
more kids simply demand more resources : energy , money and time			0
this is an aspect of family life that does n't get discussed much			0
if our increasingly wired lives leave us starved for time and more scattered in our attention , having an only child can be a path to freedom			1
according to the @entity23 , single - child families have almost doubled in number since the 1960s			1
and yet , our public conversation has n't caught up to this increasingly common reality			0
those who choose to have one child are often confronted with not so subtle snooping on the part of neighbors and friends			2
infertility problems ? marriage on the rocks ? too career focused ? we simply assume people are having multiple children unless we learn otherwise			1
in some ways , multiple children are the " american dream " story of the work / family debate			1
just as the @entity46 tale urges us that no matter where we come from , we can work our way up the ladder one rung at a time ( ignoring systemic and structural factors ) , the superwoman tale pretends that there are no limits to a mother 's resources ( ignoring , well , the realities of the space - time continuum			2
) there 's always more room in the womb and more time in the day ; as long as she 's got a smartphone and a big heart			0
but in a new book , " one and only : why having an @entity68 , and @entity69 , is better than you think , " journalist @entity66 is n't buying it			1
she writes , " one of the central myths of @entity73 is that we can engineer a life without tradeoffs			0
" she counters all the stereotypes of only children — selfish , lonely , maladjusted — with a range of convincing research , explores the environmental arguments for keeping families small , and also looks at the evidence that children from one - child families tend to achieve more and , as a result , can contribute more to society			1
just a few examples : @entity89 , @entity90 and @entity91 are all only children			0
the important questions center around our assumptions about family , what makes us happy , fulfilled and loved			0
in other words , how do we recognize our full range of choices as parents ? " is happiness the result of finding purpose and meaning ? is it the absence of depression ? " @entity66 contends that " it has a lot to do with having the freedom to live the life you want to live , whether that means five kids , or one , or none at all			1
" it is what we know in our heart of hearts , even when we 're fully ensconced in the myth — sucking down a smoothie while driving our kid to school , rescheduling a doctor 's appointment , and trying to read the notes for the morning 's meeting all at the same miserable moment			0
it is related to the work - life balance issues that @entity130 and @entity131 touched on			1
we are human , and as such , we have limits			0
whether you scale back your job , scale back your social time , scale back your self - care , scale back your child care assistance , or scale back your family size — something 's got ta give			2
admitting that is n't just a smart strategy for a saner life			0
it cuts at the core of one of modern women 's most stubborn , self - defeating beliefs -- that unless we are everything to all people , we are nothing , that our worth is tied up in our limitless capacity ( at least when it comes to caring for others ) , that we do n't actually deserve to live a selective life and take or leave a number of energy - sucking pursuits			1
it 's not that we have to choose to parent just one child if we want to be sane in contemporary society , but that we owe it to ourselves , our partners and even our potential progeny , to consider other possibilities			2
women , in particular , need to slough off socialized norms and think in a fresh , free , way about the kind of life that will really make our families -- and ourselves -- healthy and fulfilled .			2
