-- whether you 're a high schooler or @entity2 , a soccer mom or a @entity5 fan , you 've likely embraced the hooded sweatshirt at some point in life			0
for all its comfort and simplicity , the hoodie leads a dual life			2
utilitarian and homogenous in form , hooded garments have been wardrobe staples of monks and hip - hop stars , @entity20 programmers and tycoons alike			1
yet it still carries a social stigma that has made it the object of legislative bans and political speeches			0
now , amid widespread outcry over the death of @entity31 teen @entity30 , the hoodie has become a symbol of social injustice			1
focus in @entity30 case shifts to @entity36 in the month since the 17 - year - old was shot to death by a neighborhood watch patrolman , protesters nationwide have worn hoodies in a nod to the shooter 's description of @entity30			1
@entity45 told a 911 operator that he saw a " suspicious " person wearing a " dark hoodie " moments before he shot the teen in what he said was self - defense , according to police			1
@entity30 's family and supporters said they believe race played a role in the shooting			1
what witnesses say in the @entity30 case but those who participated in what have been called " hoodie marches " across the country this past week sought not only justice for @entity30 or possible prison time for @entity45			1
they wore the hoodie in solidarity against racial profiling and @entity31 's " stand your ground " gun law			1
they marched in the name of anyone who wears hoodies at the risk of being perceived as " suspicious			2
" protesters demand justice the hoodies continue to show up at rallies , on @entity81 floors and in churches , and the list of prominent people joining the movement is growing			1
@entity86 wore a hoodie in an interview monday night on " @entity89 , " and @entity90 tweeted an image of @entity93 players wearing hoodies with the words # @entity96 , # hoodies and # stereotypes			1
former talk - show host @entity99 triggered a debate over the role @entity30 's hoodie might have played in his death , opining that " his hoodie killed @entity30 as surely as @entity45 did			1
" @entity99 apologized for his comments , calling them " politically incorrect , " but stopped short of retracting his claim that parents of black and @entity112 youngsters in particular should " not let their young children go out wearing hoodies			1
" but , even before that fateful february night , hoodies were already wrapped up in negative racial connotations , said @entity114 of @entity116 's @entity115			1
" while it is clear that hoodies are a popular form of attire for @entity121 of all ethnicities and ages , it is a style that has become particularly popular for black and @entity112 youth , " she said			1
" because of the pervasive and trenchant racial stereotypes associated with black young people , especially males , their styles are often singled out for criticism , as signs of criminality and misdeeds , " she said			2
" but in truth this is simply another form of stigmatization against the person underneath the clothing , and only superficially has anything to do with the clothing			0
" even without the racial aspect , hoodies have an image problem , thanks to their association with criminal activity , said @entity146 , professor of consumer science at the @entity148			1
suspects in hooded clothing frequently appear in surveillance camera footage of armed robberies and law enforcement sketches of wanted criminals			0
among the most memorable was @entity2 , the " @entity2 " who engaged in a mail bombing campaign that spanned nearly 20 years but who first entered the public realm in a forensic sketch of a man with hoodie and sunglasses			2
@entity164 tends to magnify the stereotype by recycling it in scenes depicting violence and crime , furthering ingraining it into the public 's collective conscience , @entity163 said			2
people in turn impose those associations onto the wearer , regardless of the person 's intention			2
" when people interpret your way of dressing , hoodie or whatever , people interpret that as something you control , " she said			0
" you ca n't control how tall you 're going to be or your hair and eyes , but you can control what you put on your body , and your clothing is interpreted as representing who you are			0
" it 's often not a fair association , she said , but it 's still the one most people conjure up within seconds of meeting someone as a way of processing and categorizing the person in front of them			0
" we have to organize our world , and there 's so much that comes before us every single day , " @entity163 said			0
" it 's a shortcut to help us organize the magnitude of information that comes at us			0
" the history of the hoodie hooded garments were n't always shrouded in nefarious intent , though their function of obscuring the wearer goes back to the @entity216 , when monks and scholars wore hoods to shield their faces			0
hoods served as protective items for farmworkers into the 19th century , worn as part of jackets or overcoats , said @entity228 - @entity227 , assistant professor of apparel design at @entity231 's @entity230			1
the knitted , hooded sweatshirt was popularized in the 1930s by apparel manufacturer champion for the working class and evolved into sportswear for the mass market over the course of the 20th century			0
hoodies as we know them became part of youth popular culture in the early 1970s in @entity231 when graffiti artists wore them to hide their identities as they " bombed " buildings and walls , said hip - hop scholar @entity247 , director of @entity248 at the @entity249			1
the same era marked the hoodie 's major film debut			2
the 1976 release of " @entity254 " featured the working - class title character in well - worn gray sweats as he trains through the streets of @entity259 and makes his memorable ascent up the stairs of the @entity262 as hip - hop culture spread in the 1980s , the hoodie became part of the look associated with street style			1
when hip - hop went mainstream , penetrating homes in white middle - class suburbia and beyond , hoodies remained a key part of hip - hop 's global commercialized look , with rapper @entity275 memorializing the hoodie 's oversize style in the 2002 film " @entity279			1
" @entity281 founder @entity280 is another famous white man to make the hoodie a mainstay of his look			0
when he first entered the public sphere , @entity280 was rarely seen without a hoodie , although he has been transitioning to blazers and sport jackets more recently			0
nowadays , not a single suburban high schooler , soccer mom or @entity292 shopper would seem out of place in a hoodie			0
nor would @entity295 , for that matter			0
hoodies can be found in big - box stores for less than $ 10 or emblazoned with the high - fashion logos of @entity300 , @entity301 or @entity302 for north of $ 100			2
the flipside of its generic mainstream appeal lies in its association with crime and mischief			1
in the last decade , politicians in the @entity310 , including former prime minister @entity311 , endorsed campaigns to ban hooded tops and baseball caps in public places			0
when current prime minister @entity316 was stumping for his party , he argued for addressing the underlying causes of what drove people who wore hooded garments to break the law			0
critics branded it @entity316 's " hug - a - hoodie " message , but he still won office			1
even as hip - hop moved away from its urban roots , its " commodification " in mainstream pop nurtured the legend of the " gangster bad man , " @entity247 said			1
" the hoodie has become one of those cultural markers of the gangster outlaw			0
it is part of the construction that happens within capitalism in terms of how things are bought and sold in the marketplace , " she said			0
" so now when people see a black man with a hoodie in the street , it becomes an image of a potential thug or gangster			1
you have these stereotypical images in mind not of what everyone is actually like but what capitalism has promoted as part of this style trend			0
" meanwhile , the hoodie has been appropriated by nearly every fashion genre , from skateboarders to grunge rockers and high - end designers , said @entity227 , the @entity230 professor			2
for some , it 's not necessarily a fashion statement but simply a practical garment to be worn as a layer or an overcoat , he said			2
" i do n't think there 's anything intrinsically sinister about hoodies , " he said			2
" but for certain purposes , for certain types of people , the hoodie has wide range of applications			0
" indeed , it all boils down to who 's wearing it , @entity247 said			0
" it 's all part of the demonization of the black male and the creation of this stereotypical image of him walking down the street in the hoodie , " she said			1
" it happens all the time , and this is what 's behind the protests			0
people do n't see it as an isolated incident ; they see it as a historic trend			0

@entity99 criticized for remarks that hoodie played role in @entity30 's death
