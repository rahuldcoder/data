as they make a final push to approve presidential nominations before @entity3 take control of the @entity5 , @entity0 said tuesday the confirmation of a record number of federal judges was evidence they were right to make controversial changes to filibuster rules , despite objections from @entity3			1
" yes , " senate majority leader @entity13 responded loudly when asked if still believes he was right to employ the so - called " nuclear option " a year ago in order to clear a backlog of nominees			0
the no. 2 @entity5 @entity18 explained that at the time there was a " breakdown in the relationship between the executive and legislative branch			1
" " if you just look at where we were , with all of the nominations stacked on the calendar , most of which had been reported from committees with overwhelming bipartisan votes , " sen. @entity24 said			0
" republicans were trying to keep as many nominations from final approval as possible			2
so we had no choice			0
" during the first year of the congressional session , before the nuclear option , the @entity5 confirmed a total of 36 federal district and circuit court judges appointed by the president			1
after the rules changes , which took place nov. 21 , 2013 , the number of judges confirmed more than doubled to 84			1
the rules change lowered the number of votes needed to overcome a filibuster from 60 to 51 , making it much easier for @entity0 , who currently have a 54 to 46 majority , to approve judges to those lifetime positions			1
before the @entity5 adjourns , probably in the next day or two , democrats hope to confirm an additional 12 district court positions			1
democrats this week also cleared a new surgeon general , a top immigration official , and were ready to approve tuesday the no. 2 at the @entity62			2
each of those people faced serious @entity3 opposition and might not have been cleared if not for the rules change			2
" the train is running over everyone			0
that 's the @entity13 train			0
last trip around the track , " complained sen. @entity70 , @entity71 about the last minute wave of judicial and executive branch nominations @entity74 is jamming through			0
" it 's a result of the nuclear option which deprived us of our ability to advise and consent and it 's shameful			0
@entity70 and other @entity3 also blamed sen. @entity82 , @entity83 , and a small group of other conservatives who forced a weekend session that @entity13 used to clear procedural hurdles on a number of nominees			0
" it was also caused in part by what happened last weekend when several nominees who are controversial are now going to receive @entity5 votes and are probably going to be confirmed who otherwise probably would not have been , " said sen. @entity91 , @entity92 .			1

@entity0 say they have no *regrets* over changing the @entity5 rules to approve more judges
republicans , who will take control of the @entity5 in *january* , are upset with the maneuver
