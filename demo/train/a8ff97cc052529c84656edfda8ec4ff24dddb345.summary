@entity0 , @entity1 -- it 's thought to be the world 's oldest desert			1
the sun has been beating down on it for at least 55 million years and it covers an area of around around 31,200 square miles			2
the @entity0 is an unforgiving landscape but it 's where @entity10 chooses to spend his spare time			1
as the sun begins to set , the astronomer drives out to an abandoned airstrip in the middle of the desert and sets up his complicated telescope as the remnants of the day 's light disappears			1
" this landscape is ideal for stargazing , " says @entity10 , " because if you look around you , you can see a 360 - degree panorama of the horizon			0
" " we really have an unobstructed view of the night sky			1
there 's literally no light pollution whatsoever			1
that is what we 're looking for and that is what makes this area so incredibly special			0
" the @entity0 is largely unpopulated , extremely calm and , therefore , incredibly dark			1
this makes it one of the best places in the world to stargaze			1

he spends as much time as possible gazing at the skies : " i have n't discovered anything of importance yet , like maybe a comet or dwarf planet , but i 'm still young -- i 've got plenty of time left			0
" last year , the @entity54 selected this area as an international dark sky reserve , which means it has one of the darkest skies measured on @entity59			0
it is the first place in @entity61 to be given the title and one of only four other places in the world			1
@entity10 first decided to pursue astronomy when he saw @entity68 's comet in 1986			0
now he travels around @entity1 , providing stargazing and astronomy education through his company , @entity71			0
his goal is to have more young heads in the clouds			0
" nobody looks up anymore , " @entity10 laments			0
" when you look up into the night sky through a telescope like this , it makes you feel very small , especially when you find out how big some of the stars are			1
@entity83 , which is a red supergiant star , is 550 times bigger than our own sun. " @entity1 's night sky is one of its greatest tourist attractions , but with the country 's increasing development comes the threat of light pollution			1
introducing too much light to the area will damage ecosystems as well as stargazing opportunities			2
night - time lighting can disturb the sleep patterns of animals , which can alter feeding and mating behavior			2
@entity103 is an environmental educator at @entity105 , the @entity106			2
he lectures visiting students about how to lessen light pollution and has made it his mission to teach fellow @entity1 about sustainable lifestyles that will keep the sky pristine			1
he feels a very personal attachment to the @entity1 sky			0
" if i think back to when i was young , i was always told stories by my grannies associated with something to do with the stars up there , " he says			0
" it 's something i grew up with from a young age			0
i do n't want to wake up one day and find it gone			0
" though funding is a challenge , along with keeping up with the latest equipment , @entity123 is also determined to enlighten more people about @entity1 as an ideal location for stargazing			2
for him , one glimpse into deep space makes it all worth the effort			0
" i think the one big question everybody asks is ' are we alone ? ' -- is there other life out there ? " you know , given the size of our milky way galaxy , which is 100,000 light years in diameter , and the fact that almost every single star we see is a double star -- in other words it 's two stars orbiting each other -- and there are planets orbiting around those , it suddenly makes you feel not alone anymore			2

@entity0 is one of the best places in the world to stargaze
pitch black at night , its has been named an @entity159
environmental *groups* are keeping the desert free from light pollution
