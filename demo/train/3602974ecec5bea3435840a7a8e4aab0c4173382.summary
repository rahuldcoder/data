-- at 31 , @entity1 has a lot more going for him than @entity3			1
as the co-founder of music - sharing service @entity5 and the former president of @entity8 , he 's an internet pioneer			0
and he throws a hell of a party			1
last week , during @entity8 's f8 conference in @entity13 , @entity1 transformed an empty warehouse into one big vip room , complete with a lavish buffet and celebrity guests			1
despite having only two days to plan the event , he somehow managed to get @entity19 , the @entity20 and @entity21 to perform for a few hundred invited guests			0
estimates put the party tab at $ 1 million or more			1
the purpose of the shindig was to celebrate the @entity29 arrival of @entity30 , the music - streaming service in which @entity1 is a major investor			1
@entity30 also is partnering with @entity8 to let users play and share music within the social network			1
the event featured an onstage chat between @entity1 and @entity30 ceo @entity38			1
beside every chair in the media 's seating section sat a bottle of high - end tequila			0
of the hundreds of media events i 've attended over the years , this is the first time i 've seen that			0
not in attendance was @entity3 , the singer - turned - actor who portrayed @entity1 as a backstabbing opportunist in last year 's " @entity51			1
" in past interviews , @entity1 has called the movie " a complete work of fiction			1
" after the @entity20 played , i sat down with @entity1 for a few minutes in a private area upstairs			1
the first thing we talked about was @entity5			0
i mentioned that i would never forget that feeling of downloading free music , that it felt like you had won one of those contests where you could fill up your shopping cart for free			0
" i still hear that a lot , " he told me			0
here are a few excerpts from our talk , edited for clarity : on his affinity with @entity5 co-founder @entity73 : " @entity74 and i immediately realized that we had an interest in more than just computers and software and hacking and security , that we actually had an interest in doing something with a broader cultural importance			0
one of those ideas was @entity5			0
" on being a billionaire " i definitely wanted to earn my freedom			0
but the primary motivation was n't making money , but making an impact			1
i think the perception of wealth and power is that things just become easier and easier when in reality as you raise the stakes things become more stressful			0
you just keep pushing yourself harder and harder to achieve more and more -- i do n't think it 's ever quite as glamorous as it appears on the outside			2
" on @entity100 's @entity99 " @entity99 is one the greatest business artists in history and has had more impact through his product design in @entity100 than any other ceo			1
" on @entity3 's unflattering depiction of him " it 's a blessing and a curse in the sense it definitely raised my profile somewhat -- that character in the film played by @entity3 represents a set of values that i just do n't agree with			2
it 's difficult watching a character using your name and interacting with people [ while ] supposedly [ doing ] a portrayal of you			2
" on his business role " early on i wanted to run a company , but i quickly realized there was this other model available			2
maybe i 'm blazing a new path with this model because you do n't typically see this			2
you see investors who have portfolio companies but are n't very active , or entrepreneurs who typically run one company for their entire life , or occasionally , serial entrepreneurs who do a series of small companies			2
but they typically run them for a fairly long period of time			0
i 've been doing a hybrid of investing and entrepreneurship , which i think initially i was n't set out to do			2
but i realized it fit my personality			0

@entity1 throws $ 1 million party to celebrate arrival of @entity30
@entity1 says primary motivation for business is n't becoming a *millionaire*
