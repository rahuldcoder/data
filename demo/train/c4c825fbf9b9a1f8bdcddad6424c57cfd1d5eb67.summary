-- " @entity1 " has never strictly followed the book series it 's based on , but that fan frustration turned disturbing on sunday 's episode			1
in the third installment of the fourth season , " @entity14 , " fans were flabbergasted by a scene in which @entity9 ( @entity10 ) forces himself on his sister , @entity12 ( @entity13 )			2
it was n't the incest viewers were taken back by -- @entity18 and @entity12 's relationship is a crucial thread in the books and on the @entity22 series -- but the rape			1
it was a confusing and jarring plot twist , not only because @entity9 and @entity12 's trysts have been consensual , but because the scene does n't play out that way in @entity29 's " @entity28 " series			1
as excerpts show , @entity29 did envision @entity9 being the more enthusiastic participant at this point in the story , and @entity12 as more hesitant			1
but , as @entity29 makes clear on his blog , she was n't raped			1
" though the time and place is wildly inappropriate and @entity12 is fearful of discovery , she is as hungry for him as he is for her , " he says			0
that said , " @entity1 " has made some chronological changes to the storyline , meaning " neither character is in the same place as in the books , which may be why ( the scene ) played ... differently , " @entity29 went on			1
" but that 's just my surmise ; we never discussed this scene , to the best of my recollection			2
" it sounds like the director and the two actors starring in the scene did n't talk much about it either			2
as the episode 's helmer @entity61 told @entity64 's @entity63 , " nobody really wanted to talk about what was going on between the two characters , so we had a rehearsal that was a blocking rehearsal			2
... by the time you do that and you walk through it , the actors feel comfortable going home to think about it			0
the only other thing i did was that ordinarily , you rehearse the night before , and i wanted to rehearse that scene four days before , so that we could think about everything			0
and it worked out really well			0
that 's one of my favorite scenes i 've ever done			0
" @entity61 also appears to have a different understanding of what was portrayed on screen			0
" well , it becomes consensual by the end , because anything for them ultimately results in a turn - on , especially a power struggle , " he said			0
although @entity29 did n't have a conversation about the controversial moment before it arrived on air , he did always intend for that moment " to be disturbing , " the author says on his blog			1
" but i do regret if it has disturbed people for the wrong reasons			0
