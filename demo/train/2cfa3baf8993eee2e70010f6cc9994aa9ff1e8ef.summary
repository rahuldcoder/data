-- in the radio biz , if the buzz is good , the listeners will come			1
but now a suicide that followed an @entity6 radio prank is forcing @entity8 radio broadcasters to look in the mirror			1
" it was a feeding frenzy last week when the prank first happened , " said @entity10 , a radio consultant for about 100 stations			1
" we thought , ' this is the greatest thing ever ! ' then , of course , it became a tragedy			1
" although the story is @entity21 on @entity8 airwaves , where pranks and stunts are all too common , it 's hard to know what 's being said off the air -- when studio microphones are not live			1
the blame is widespread , says 40 - plus - year radio veteran @entity29			1
" most of the industry people i 've talked to are saying it 's not the @entity34 ' fault			1
but it does make radio as a whole look pretty stupid			2
" nurse @entity40 's apparent suicide after @entity6 djs @entity42 and @entity43 fooled her into thinking they were @entity44 and prince @entity45 has triggered @entity8 station owners to take a new look at their policies concerning pranks and stunts , industry insiders say			1
" there is no way they could have anticipated this , " said @entity10			0
now station owners , he said , are reviewing policy and reminding their talent to toe the line when it comes to stunts and pranks			2
" my advice : it 's a tragedy , but just calm down			1
" " the djs should not blame themselves , " wrote @entity0 commenter @entity63 , who described herself as a paralegal			0
" no one commits suicide over a prank			2
" but another commenter , identifying as yokohamacat , wrote that " without their prank , she would probably be alive now			2
djs can not go claiming total innocence as long as there is a clear sequence of suicide and the prank call			2
" related story : prank call radio station donates to nurse 's family when it comes to prank phone calls on @entity8 radio -- believe it or not -- there are rules			1
in fact , the @entity6 prank never would have happened in the @entity8 , broadcasters say , because the @entity91 dictates that anyone featured on air must give their permission before their voice is broadcast			1
some stations take this so seriously that they produce fake prank phone calls by hiring impromptu actors to play the roles of unwitting listeners			2
radio has been successful partly because it has realized @entity103 does n't have to happen once a year , @entity10 said			2
the stunts he 's helped stations promote are creative to say the least			2
-- hundreds of listeners were fooled into thinking they were appearing in a @entity111 movie			0
-- a station promoted a " baby giveaway " contest by offering the winning couple free treatments for in vitro fertilization			0
-- a contest dubbed swap your wife for a @entity121 offered several couples prizes after they switched partners			0
the tragedy has morning shows nationwide thinking twice			2
" those of us in the media forget the impact we have on people 's lives , both positive and negative , " @entity29 said			2
" personally , i think anytime you publicly embarrass someone it does n't sit well with me , " said 31 - year radio veteran @entity131 , who programs 106 - 5 @entity133 in @entity134			2
related story : opinion : djs broke ' no harm ' rule is there a line that should not be crossed ? " the line is , do n't do it if it endangers the public directly , " @entity29 said			0
the suicide dredges up memories of an @entity8 radio stunt that ended tragically : a 2007 contest that left 28 - year - old @entity152 dead from acute water intoxication			1
@entity154 entered the contest sponsored by @entity156 , @entity157 , station @entity158			0
the contest promised a free @entity162 video game system to the person who could drink the most water without going to the bathroom or vomiting			0
promoters dubbed the contest , " @entity158			0
" @entity154 's family was awarded $ 16.5 million in a wrongful death suit against the station owners			0
" @entity156 really seemed to validate what a lot of people already believe : that we are this dangerous medium , " said @entity10			0
but he also calls it the " intestinal gas , fart joke medium , " because " a lot of the people are emotionally stuck in the eighth grade			0
" people who own radio stations , he says , see djs as " children playing with explosives			0
" what 's the payoff for radio pranks ? in a word , buzz			1
pressure from programmers often forces talent to go to extremes to " make noise " in the market , insiders say			0
what about ratings ? @entity203 pranks a direct result of trying to win a ratings war ? not necessarily			1
" i do n't think there 's a correlation , " @entity10 said			0
djs would devise pranks regardless , he says			0
" at the end of the day , it 's just fun			0
" but like every medium these days , radio is changing			0
will the @entity6 @entity34 's scandal leave a permanent mark ? will your favorite morning djs change their tune in the aftermath of the tragedy ? " i do n't think radio pranks will ever go away as long as there are ' funny ' morning shows , " said @entity222 , an industry pioneer and consultant who 's legendary in the business			1
" the @entity6 prank was a fluke ... though the hosts and their employers will probably think twice " in the future " and that 's probably a good thing			1
" phone pranks like the one in @entity6 have become " old and boring " @entity29 said			1
much of radio 's fun with pranks has roots in the 1950s with shows like " @entity249 " and in the ' 80s with @entity246 's " @entity245 " at @entity248 's @entity247			1
" i think it was something that was happening more in the ' 80s and ' 90s , " said @entity250 , morning co-host at @entity252 ' wfms			0
" i think you hear more mean stuff on the sports radio and news - talk stations , where they 're beating up on the listeners sometimes			0
" pranks and stunts appear to be moving from radio to reality tv , @entity29 said , leaving radio with a few basic formats that he calls " shut - up - and - play - the music " ; " i - hate - @entity268 - @entity268 " aka talk radio ; or an " ensemble of human interaction with @entity245 - like overtones , without the snarkyness			1
" if radio ends up becoming more predictable as a result of the controversy , it will disappoint many broadcasters as well as listeners			1
it 's radio 's unpredictability , they say , that makes it great			1
" anything can happen , " @entity10 said			0
" but should this stop us from doing everything ? no. "			0
