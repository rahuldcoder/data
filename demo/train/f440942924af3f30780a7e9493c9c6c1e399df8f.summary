-- for a year , journalist and author @entity1 traveled the edges of @entity4 exploring a side of the country that obliterates expectations			1
" most people are unaware of the sheer diversity of @entity4 in terms of ethnic minorities , " says the former @entity9 resident and @entity4 correspondent for the @entity12 newspaper			1
" i met people who have blond hair and blue eyes and look completely @entity20 but are 100 % @entity21 in terms of upbringing and language			0
" the @entity21 government officially classifies 55 ethnic minorities			1
during his travels through @entity28 , @entity29 , @entity30 and the @entity32 region , @entity1 met many of them			1
these are people distinct from the @entity21 majority -- the @entity36 -- with their own languages , cultures and histories , who happen to be living within @entity4 's national borders			1
@entity1 has collated their stories in his latest book , " @entity44 : travels at the @entity47 , " published in july by @entity45			1
@entity0 spoke with @entity1 ( now based in @entity48 ) about his travels and @entity4 's ethnic minority communities			1
@entity0 : why write this book ? @entity1 : there are a hundred million people living in @entity4 who are n't @entity36			1
i wanted to go to those regions and give them a bit of voice			0
@entity0 : your favorite place from your travels ? @entity1 : deep south of @entity28			1
it 's got great food , it 's not a politically sensitive area			1
almost half of @entity21 minorities live in the south of @entity28			0
if you want , you can see @entity71 villages , @entity73 villages and a fair number of tourists do go there for that			0
the @entity21 like to think of @entity77 [ an autonomous prefecture within @entity28 ] as their own @entity78			1
it does n't have a coastline , but the food , language and climate are all similar to @entity84			1
@entity0 : any memories stand out from the area ? @entity1 : one of my favorite experiences was trekking through villages along the border with @entity91 and staying with families along the way			1
you just arrive and ask around , pay them rmb 50 ( $ 8 ) and they 'll say , " sure , " and you can drink rice wine with them			0
@entity0 : which was the most difficult place to cover ? @entity1 : @entity29 just because of the controls the government places on foreigners who go there			1
as a journalist you 're not meant to be there , but it 's not a problem for tourists			1
it 's a stunning part of the world			2
you 'll see scenery that you do n't see anywhere else on the planet			0
( but ) @entity117 are the hardest people to really engage with			2
you wo n't want to get them in trouble by asking sensitive questions , and a lot are scared by the heavy @entity122 and wujing ( paramilitary ) presence			0
the food is really bad			2
the hotels are n't really hotels , they 're just like plain concrete - floor rooms with no showers			0
there was a space of 10 days where i had one shower			0
@entity0 : what was wrong with the food ? @entity1 : they ca n't grow vegetables so it 's all imported			1
i love @entity21 food but i have to say @entity117 food is my least favorite			2
it 's dumplings or fried rice and a bit of yak meat if you 're lucky , so yeah it grinds you down a bit			2
@entity0 : what was the appeal of @entity32 , @entity4 's northeast region ? @entity1 : it 's right next door to @entity155 and @entity156 and i do n't think people realize that there 's like a " third @entity155 " within @entity4			1
there are a couple million ethnic @entity155 living in @entity32 along the border , they are given leeway in terms of speaking the language and going to schools that teach in @entity166			1
they are all watching @entity166 soap operas and listening to k - pop and eating dog ( a common @entity171 ) and kimchi inside @entity4			1
@entity21 @entity155 are all from @entity155 , but culturally they are @entity166 , they have n't been cut off and isolated			1
@entity0 : did you get to the @entity156 border area ? @entity1 : when you head toward @entity156 it just looks like @entity177			1
i was there in winter and the landscape is bleak , lots of snow and under - populated areas			0
i was interested in @entity183 in this region			0
the @entity183 were the only minority that ruled @entity4 in the past			1
i thought it was interesting to see their homelands and how they had been absorbed to the point of having only 100 people left who can still speak the @entity193 language			0
@entity0 : did you meet any @entity183 ? @entity1 : the only genuine @entity183 person i met was in @entity30 , thousands of miles away from what was once the @entity193 heartland			1
there 's a specific ethnic minority in @entity30 -- the @entity200 -- who are closely related to the @entity183 and who are the descendants of soldiers sent to guard the edges of the @entity205 in the 18th century			2
@entity30 is now the only place in @entity4 where you 're likely to hear someone speaking an approximation of @entity193			2
in fact , although around 10 million people in @entity4 register themselves as @entity183 , most are mixed @entity36 and @entity183 , a result of extensive intermarriage , so there are very few people left who are 100 % @entity183			2
@entity0 : in the book you seem pessimistic about the @entity117 and uyghur independence movements			0
@entity1 : i 'm pessimistic about @entity117 and @entity221 gaining independence			2
to split the country is ultimate heresy for the @entity226 ( @entity226 ) , it will never happen and they will do everything to prevent it			0
sadly the situation now in @entity30 and @entity29 has gotten to the point where violent extremism is the way forward rather than reconciliation			0
you 're not going to see @entity221 sitting down in @entity9 for talks			0
giving @entity237 life in prison sends the message : it 's our way or no way			0
[ a uyghur economics professor at @entity9 's @entity243 , @entity237 was found guilty of " separatism " and sentenced to life in prison by a @entity21 court in september			0
] the situation will only get worse			0
it will present really big challenges for the @entity226			0
are they going to effectively keep one - third of @entity4 's landmass under virtual martial law ? @entity0 : would you say @entity255 and @entity256 are heading down a similar road ? @entity1 : what 's happening on the fringes , you can include @entity256 into that			1
@entity256 is it 's own place			0
it 's not the mainland			0
in @entity30 and @entity29 , @entity226 rule is being challenged more and more , and the same goes for @entity256 where ( they 're ) doing it in a peaceful , nonviolent way			0
i think it 's interesting that the pressures the @entity226 are getting are from parts of the country that were previously regarded as reasonably docile			0
they were n't prepared for @entity256 people to stand up and say " no " and they have to be careful because @entity255 is looking very closely at what 's going on in @entity256 to determine whether @entity276 will work for them			0
@entity0 : some argue that @entity4 is already doing the best it can to keep an incredibly large country and population relatively united			2
@entity1 : managing @entity4 is insanity			1
how do you do it ? i still think @entity4 is the most fascinating country in the world for many of these reasons			2
@entity4 is more like an empire			2
@entity4 has always been difficult , which is why the book is called " the emperor @entity44			1
" @entity0 : what do you always travel with ? @entity1 : a @entity293 army knife , notebook , pen and money or access to money , as well as passport , of course			2
anything else you can buy along the way .			0
