-- in his second inaugural address last month , president @entity1 forcefully articulated a case for confronting the climate crisis			1
in his @entity7 speech on tuesday , i encourage him to lay out a plan on it			1
i realize @entity10 can be an obstacle			0
a few years ago , the right and left discussed how best to tackle the climate crisis			1
today , it has become an article of faith among some conservatives to ignore science and deny there is a human - made crisis at all			2
just last week , sen. @entity21 , the oft - touted 2016 @entity22 savior who will deliver the @entity22 response to the @entity7 , falsely claimed there was " reasonable debate " on the issue			0
there is no alternative but to act			0
as if the warnings from scientists were n't enough , in 2012 -- the hottest year on record in the contiguous @entity34 -- we saw the true face of climate change : freak storms , raging wildfires , a new @entity39 in the heartland and devastating damages			1
most heartbreakingly , innocent lives were lost			0
here 's what @entity1 can do to help stop climate change -- and what he should announce in his speech on tuesday night			1
opinion : @entity1 's chance to lead , or kick the can down the road 1			1
negotiate a bilateral agreement with @entity53 new secretary of state @entity54 declared climate change a " life - threatening issue " at his confirmation hearing			1
@entity1 should make his chief diplomat 's top priority the crafting of a bilateral agreement with @entity53 to reduce carbon pollution and accelerate clean energy			1
even if the @entity67 climate negotiations produce a treaty with teeth , the @entity65 will refuse to ratify it unless @entity53 is on board			1
growing concerns about air pollution have the @entity53 government talking about renewable energy			1
an agreement between the two largest emitters of greenhouse gasses would set the whole planet on a more sustainable path			1
the best thing about this option : @entity1 does not need @entity10 ' approval to start the dialogue			2
furthermore , he can use the buildup to the @entity67 climate summit as an opportunity to educate the public about the real dangers of climate chaos			2
stop the @entity91 some scientists liken building the pipeline to lighting the fuse on the world 's biggest carbon bomb			2
according to industry experts , without the demand from this pipeline , most of the oil in the @entity100 tar sands would stay safely in the ground			0
instead , @entity91 would funnel the dirtiest oil on @entity106 from @entity107 to the @entity108 , which would do nothing to reduce our dependence on foreign energy while causing irreparable harm			2
in return , we could get higher gas prices , risk of a @entity118 - like spill in the heartland and fewer jobs than there are people employed in the wind industry right now			0
use executive branch powers although @entity1 can not institute a carbon tax without @entity10 , he is not without options			1
the @entity128 used its authority to regulate carbon dioxide as a source of pollution and set higher standards for power plants			1
the @entity128 could go further			2
@entity1 should also support the efforts of the @entity128 to set new standards for soot based on the best and latest science			1
the administration could also open more public land for renewable energy development			2
finally , the president should publicly commit to making sure coal miners emerge as winners in the transition to clean energy jobs			0
at the least , the people who sacrifice their health to bring us power deserve secure pensions , world class health care and the opportunity to be trained in the industries of the future			0
twenty years from today , we could live in an age defined by ever - more - violent storms and watch as other nations stake out a crucial advantage in clean energy technology			0
or , we can reject that future now and lead a healthier , more prosperous world well into the 21st century			0
tackling the issue entails some political risks			0
but the president should know that if he leads , a movement will rise to stand behind him			0
this sunday , tens of thousands of @entity34 are expected to gather in @entity168 for the massive " @entity169			0
they will be joined by thousands more across the nation			0
a generation from now , this president 's legacy will be measured by his record on climate			1
strong words in the inaugural address were just the starting point			0
on tuesday , we need to hear a concrete plan			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			2

@entity184 : president @entity1 should lay out a plan on climate crisis in his sotu speech
@entity184 : @entity1 should push for a bilateral agreement with @entity53 to reduce carbon pollution
he says the administration should support the @entity128 to set stronger air pollution standards
@entity184 : this president 's legacy will be measured by his record on climate
