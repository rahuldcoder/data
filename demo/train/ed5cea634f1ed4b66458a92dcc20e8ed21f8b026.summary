-- he can legitimately claim to be the fastest man on ice , and @entity4 could even give @entity5 a run for his money in a foot race over 30 meters			1
the @entity10 bobsleigh superstar already has an imposing tally of four olympic gold medals and seven world championship titles -- and he 's looking for more			1
@entity4 and his two - man teammate @entity14 can reach speeds of up to 155 kilometers per hour ( 96 mph ) , as they hurtle down the high - speed turns and straights			1
" it 's a speedy sport , a racing type of sport , it 's also known as the @entity23 of the winter , " the 33 - year - old @entity4 told @entity0 's human to @entity19			1
" there are accidents , i 've crashed before and it 's definitely dangerous			0
sometimes you crash really quickly and get serious injuries			0
" up to now , i 've been lucky in my crashes although i 've crashed pretty fast and had minor head injuries afterwards			0
" @entity4 is called the brakeman , but it 's a misleading title , because he only applies the brake to pull the sled up after the finish			2
his main job is to push - start the bobsled in the first crucial moments , building momentum before jumping in and allowing the 34 - year - old @entity41 to do the steering			1
his explosive speed off the mark has seen him timed at 3.69 seconds for those opening 30 meters			2
by comparison , @entity45 sprint hero @entity5 was clocked at 3.78 for the same distance on his way to gold in a record - breaking 100 meters time at the @entity50			1
sprinting prowess is one of the key ingredients in a successful bobsleigh team , which is why @entity45 famously dabbled in the sport at the 1988 @entity56 in @entity57 , inspiring the 1993 hit film " @entity59			0
" @entity4 actually started his sporting life as a track and field athlete of some note , claiming a bronze in @entity10 's 4x100m relay squad at the 1998 world junior championships in @entity66 in @entity67			1
his sheer bulk -- weighing in at 120 kg as against 94 kg for @entity5 -- was always going to be a barrier on the track , and he was persuaded to try a new challenge by @entity10 's national bobsled team coach @entity72			1
it proved to be an inspired selection , and @entity4 won his first olympic gold medal at @entity76 in 2002 as part of the victorious @entity10 four - man team			1
double gold followed in the two and four - man teams in @entity81 four years later , with his fourth gold in the two - man in the @entity84 in @entity85 and a silver in the four - man			1
@entity41 was a driver in the @entity10 pair that took silver in the two - man in @entity92 and has now teamed up with @entity4 to focus on going one better at the world championships next year in @entity94 in @entity95 in january and the @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98			1
punishing training despite their advancing years , the pair have a punishing regime , particularly in their " off " season			0
" we 're winter sportsmen , who were made in summer			0
we have to sweat in the summer while others are lying down in the sun , " @entity14 said			2
they train twice a day , six days a week , totaling about seven hours per day			0
" sunday is more laidback , just a bit of upper body strength			0
and we 've got one unit that lasts three to four hours , " said @entity4			2
the four - time @entity112 champion concentrates on a mixture of strength training with weights and sprint training , often pulling a weight behind him for extra resistance			2
@entity41 also has to play his part as they charge down the course , pushing a sled weighing 170 kg , so his training is along similar lines , but as the pilot or driver he has the responsibility to capitalize on the blistering start			2
" the pilot is always the first one sitting in there , " he said , " so that you can get to the steering cords quickly and to be able to react quickly , too			0
" @entity23 feeling @entity133 - fast reflexes are indeed a prerequisite of the driver 's role , as the sled hurtles down an icy chute with the speed increasing all the time			2
" i just try to drive straight down the track , but you really have to work together , " said @entity14			2
for @entity4 's part , his job is curl up into an aerodynamic position , not easy given his bulk , then flow with the rhythm going through the corners , supporting the driver with his weight -- rather like a motorcycle pillion passenger			0
" and of course braking at the right time , so as not to let the pilot get too terrified ! " he said -- unlike the " @entity59 " team who suffer a comical crash in the film after failing to stop at the end of the run			0
the @entity23 comparison begins and ends with the speed comparison , because unlike a @entity164 or @entity165 , the pair have to repair and " fine tune " their own bobsled rather than having a massive team of mechanics to assist them			0
and despite being at the top of their sport , both have trained for other professions -- @entity41 is a policeman while @entity4 is in the @entity176 ( the " @entity177			1
" ) @entity10 domination they are seeking to continue the level of domination achieved by the @entity10 men 's bobsleigh teams in world and @entity112 championships			1
since @entity4 's first @entity56 in 2002 , @entity10 two - man teams have won three straight golds , achieving a 1 - 2 finish at @entity84			1
in the four - man event , two gold medals were followed by a silver behind the @entity193 quartet -- which , strangely given his winning record , @entity4 rates as his most memorable achievement			1
" the best was the silver medal in @entity85			0
we had the best start times but we almost fell on our side on one run , " he said			0
" to pull that back and win the silver by one - hundredth ( of a second , from @entity92 ) was for me an emotional eruption , as it was truly hard earned			0
" @entity4 came from a strong sporting background -- both his parents were in the @entity10 national track and field team -- and they encouraged him to go one better			1
" we had a family dream to go to the @entity112			0
when you 're sitting in front of the tv and watching the @entity112 , and you have sporty parents , that 's naturally a big dream for you , because the @entity112 are the biggest event there is , " he said			0
" naturally it became more than a dream , at the first @entity112 with the gold medal , and that was really my greatest goal , which i fulfilled pretty quickly , but it did n't stop there			2
" golden focus his longevity and medal haul have seen him earn celebrity status in @entity10 , while @entity41 has won three world championship silvers and @entity112 silver in @entity85			1
he is hoping his partnership with @entity4 , formed after the great @entity10 driver @entity233 retired , will see him earn that elusive gold			1
" our biggest aim is to become the world champions and to become @entity112 champions			2
we 're a strong team			0
we 've got every chance to be the best in the world with this team			0

@entity4 and @entity14 represent @entity10 at two - man bobsleigh
@entity4 has won four olympic gold medals and a silver
his speed off the mark is *legendary* and matches the great @entity5
@entity41 is seeking his first gold at world and @entity112 level
