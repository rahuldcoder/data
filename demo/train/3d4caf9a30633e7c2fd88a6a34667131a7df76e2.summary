she had won a @entity38 court order in may to become the temporary conservator for her ailing father , but he went missing for a few days from a nursing home there before being found in @entity30 with his wife , @entity17 's stepmother			1
on friday morning , a @entity46 , @entity30 , judge granted @entity17 permission to take her father to a doctor			1
@entity17 went to the home sunday , her representative , @entity49 , said			2
she stayed on the street while paramedics went to get the 82 - year - old icon , @entity49 said			0
