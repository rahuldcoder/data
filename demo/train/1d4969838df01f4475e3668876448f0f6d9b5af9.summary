federal officials made such an announcement this week after they raided downtown businesses and seized an estimated $ 100 million in cash and from bank accounts around the world that were part of forfeiture actions in the ongoing probe			1
some of the laundered money included ransom payments to the @entity25 drug cartel that allegedly kidnapped and tortured a @entity27 citizen at a ranch in @entity29			2

" @entity39 is the gateway to the rest of the @entity27 , " @entity40 said			0

the seventh - largest economy in the world			0
" use of peso brokers the cartels used a scheme known as " trade - based money laundering " or " black market peso exchange , " federal officials said			1
on wednesday , 1,000 law officers swept through a section of downtown @entity0 known as the " fashion district , " which is known more for its dense bazaar - like maze of shops than for any catwalks or haute couture			1
authorities initially seized $ 65 million , but the figure grew thursday to more than $ 100 million , said @entity67 , a spokesman for federal prosecutors			1
in the " @entity72 " raids , nine people were arrested in the investigation into laundering drug proceeds for cartels , authorities said			2

an $ 18 billion sector of downtown authorities also say the " vast majority " of @entity0 's $ 18 billion garment district is legitimate and operates lawfully			1

" the scope of this current case and its potential long - term impact are truly unprecedented , " @entity116 said			0
a major tipoff to the illegal activity came when the @entity25 drug cartel used a fashion district firm as a conduit to launder and accept ransom for the release of a @entity27 drug dealer who was kidnapped and tortured by narco thugs			2
" the victim was held captive at a ranch in @entity25 , where he was beaten , shot , electrocuted and water - boarded			0

the raids capped a two - year investigation , and attorney general @entity40 called " transnational gangs " like those behind money laundering " the number one threat to @entity39 's public safety			1
" how it worked under the scheme , a peso broker would work with a @entity27 - based drug dealer or another conspirator who needs to send dollars to @entity29 or another country , authorities said			1
to do so , the broker would find businesses in @entity29 that buy goods from @entity27 - based firms such as those in the @entity0 ' fashion district			1
the @entity29 merchants would send dollars to the @entity0 fashion district stores , authorities said			1
in return , the fashion shops sent goods to the @entity29 businesses , which then sold the products and gave the proceeds in pesos to the broker and eventually the cartels , authorities said			2
cartels allegedly use the scheme to avoid " the risk of smuggling bulk amounts of @entity27 currency across the @entity29 border and without having to convert and wire the @entity27 currency through established financial institutions , which not only carries transaction fees , but also a threat their illegal activity will be detected , " prosecutors said in a statement			2
" it also gives them a presence in the @entity27 they otherwise would n't have , indeed a presence in our business industry , " @entity30 said			0
also , in june 2010 , @entity29 announced anti-money laundering regulations " that restrict the amount of physical cash denominated in @entity27 dollars that @entity29 banks may receive , " a grand jury indictment said			0
