@entity0 -- it may look more amusement park than @entity4 , but the twisting red metal tower at the heart of the @entity8 site is no helter - skelter -- it 's a massive piece of contemporary art named the @entity11			1
the sculpture , created by artist @entity13 and designer @entity14 , has become a common sight on televisions across the globe in recent days , snaking up through the sky alongside the @entity19			1
but while many visitors to the park have been happy to study the swirling structure from the ground , or to ride to the top and enjoy the sweeping views it offers across @entity0 , others are n't so sure			1
" i think it 's amazing , it looks like a roller coaster , " @entity28 , an 11 - year - old local schoolgirl , told @entity1 on her first visit to the tower			2
" it 's so ugly it becomes interesting , " another @entity35 fan said this week after visiting the sculpture			2
earlier this year when the @entity11 was first unveiled , @entity0 's mayor claimed it was better than the @entity40			1
@entity41 said the artwork , which rises up next to the @entity19 at @entity43 in the city 's @entity44 was " a masterpiece of design and engineering			0
" " it endlessly repays the viewer , it is a very rewarding thing to look at			0
the @entity40 is very simple , the @entity52 , behind me , is a piece of cake -- any child of two could do that -- this is much more elaborate , more sophisticated , more intriguing and complex , " he told @entity1			0
the tower stands 114.5 meters ( 375 feet ) tall , making it @entity60 's biggest sculpture , more than twice the height of @entity62 , almost six times the height of the @entity64 , and 22 meters taller than the @entity65			1
visitors climb 455 steps -- or ride one of two elevators -- to two observation decks offering expansive vistas across @entity0			1
@entity41 and @entity72 , ceo of steelmaker @entity73 , joined forces to champion the creation of a large - scale sculpture at the @entity4 -- after meeting in a cloakroom at @entity80			1
" it started as a small project , a casual discussion			0
" @entity72 told @entity1 in may			0
" it was just a scribble on a piece of paper			0
but it expanded and expanded into this exciting project			0
" @entity72 's company stumped up more than £ 19 million ( $ 30 million ) of the £ 24 million cost of the structure , providing steel from their plants across the globe			1
" the @entity35 are a global games -- the whole world participates , 202 countries			0
@entity73 has businesses in so many countries around the world and so i wanted every one to participate , " he said			0
@entity13 and @entity14 won a competition to design the piece , and have watched it rise from the one - time wasteland , as the @entity35 venues around it have also taken shape			1
@entity13 said the initial brief called for a tower on the @entity35 site , " 100 meters tall , or more , and we 've done more , " explaining that the work " questions the concept of what towers can be			1
" " as you walk up , around and through it , it 's as if the object is happening around you , " he said when the sculpture was completed , adding that the @entity11 " demands , requires , needs public participation			2
" " it 's all about being here , being involved , " he told @entity1			0
the artist conceded that the £ 15 entry fee ( £ 7 for children ) was high , but said it had been an expensive project , and that he hoped it would eventually be free , allowing more people to visit			0
designer @entity14 said the pair intended the sculpture to last far longer than the few weeks of the @entity35			2
" we hope it will be a monument for @entity0 , that will stand for 50 years -- though it might need a paint job by then -- and that it will be a beacon , drawing people to the area			2
" @entity13 said he was ready for criticism : " when you add such a big edifice to @entity0 's skyline , necessarily , people will scrutinize it , and some will be critical , and that 's part of the process			1
we will see ... "			0
