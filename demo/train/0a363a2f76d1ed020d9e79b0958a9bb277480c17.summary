-- a trip to @entity2 to learn more about her family 's ancestry became a nightmare for @entity8 journalist @entity7			1
in january 2009 , several men showed up at the @entity2 - @entity8 's door and carted her off to @entity12 , the notoriously brutal lockup outside @entity13 where three @entity8 hikers were recently imprisoned			1
like @entity15 , @entity15 and @entity15 , @entity7 was accused of being a spy for the @entity8 like them , she denied the accusation			1
@entity2 tried , convicted and sentenced @entity7 to eight years			1
but , to her shock , she was freed after 100 days			1
she returned to the @entity8 in may 2009			1
on wednesday , @entity15 and @entity15 were freed after two years at @entity12			1
@entity15 was released last year			1
@entity0 talked with @entity7 about the advice she would give the hikers and about her experience at @entity12			1
@entity0 : did you ever hope that you might be set free , even after your sentence ? @entity7 : i did n't think i was going to be set free after being sentenced to eight years			1
when they said i was going to be freed , i was in disbelief , very happy disbelief			1
@entity0 : you wrote in your book that about gaining a unique kind of mental clarity and toughness			2
@entity7 : i learned over time , especially from my cellmates , that things happen to you , and you ca n't control them			1
all you can control is your response to them			2
in prison , you can not control your physical environment			1
@entity0 : you can say that , but to actually live that way under those circumstances is another thing			2
you were interrogated for days on end			2
@entity7 : ( the interrogators ) were mostly harsh and threatening , but then they would say , " oh , are you hungry ? do you want us to make comfortable ? do you want some tea or some water ? " i think it was partly to mess with the person 's mind			1
my cellmates , the women who were prisoners , they are the strong ones			2
there were times when i was angry and told myself that i hate the sin and not the sinner			2
i had to learn from my cellmates , who were in prison much longer			1
i asked them , " how do you not hate these people for doing this to you ? " ( @entity7 says she nurtured relationships with other prisoners by teaching them @entity70			1
many were at @entity12 for believing in @entity71 , a monotheistic faith believers are persecuted for in @entity2			2
) @entity7 : these prisoners told me , " we do n't hate ( the guards ) , but we forgive them , " which was incredible to me			1
i tried hard to hate the sin and not the sinner			2
... i realized we are all human beings , and ( the prison workers ) do their jobs to have job security			1
they get paid for it			2
some of them do believe in the ideology , and some do n't			2
if our captors , i believe , were raised in a different environment , they would n't do what they do			2
but i really got a lot of strength from other prisoners			2
we taught each other jokes in our different languages			2
i taught them vocabulary that had to do with shopping and @entity70 curse words			2
@entity0 : how did you exercise ? @entity7 : sit - ups , push - ups in our cell			1
we were allowed to go outside four times a day , escorted by guards who pushed and tugged at the chadors we had to wear			2
the guards would take us to a cement cage -- the walls , all cement and bars			0
overhead them , at least you could see sky			0
@entity0 : when the guards were marching you back and forth , did you say anything to them ? did they speak to you ? @entity7 : they mostly did n't say anything			1
( but ) a female guard -- she was older -- reached under my chador and grabbed my hand and squeezed it			0
@entity0 : did you see any other humanity like that in your guards ? @entity7 : there was humanity in some of them , in this female guard			1
she seemed to be trying to tell me that everyone would be ok			0
toward me , the guards were mostly civil			0
i did see them yelling at other prisoners			0
i assume that because i was a foreigner , and @entity2 say they are kind to foreigners			0
we tried to learn more about the women guards , because they would stop by our cells when they were giving us food			0
they were very tight - lipped and were instructed not to say much about themselves			0
we got tidbits about their lives			0
one had kids , and one had a nose job ; this kind of plastic surgery is very popular in @entity2			0
they had the same values -- caring about how they looked -- like other women would have			0
but i did n't get that close with any of them			0
they do n't allow it			0
@entity0 : tell me more about how you kept sane , especially in solitary confinement			0
how did you even keep track of time ? @entity7 : well , i thought i was going crazy			1
i was in solitary for more than two weeks ; then i was sent to a cell that had state - run tv playing so i could see the time			0
i could hear the call to prayer and see sun rays cast on the cell walls and floors			0
@entity0 : can you describe what solitary confinement was like ? @entity7 : it was dark			1
i could hold my hands out and touch two walls			0
there was ratty brown carpet			0
there was a broke toilet			0
a sign on the wall quoted ( founder and supreme leader of the @entity182 said , " prisons must be colleges for human improvement			0
" there was a window on the ceiling out of reach that was covered with metal mesh and bars			0
on the other side of my wall , i heard a prisoner whimpering			0
i was very worried , because no one knew where i was			0
( @entity7 wrote in her memoir " between two worlds : my life and captivity in @entity2 " that only after many days did @entity2 authorities allow her to call her father			1
they forced her to lie to him in saying that she did n't know where she was and that she was in trouble for drinking alcohol			0
) i tried to keep my sanity by singing songs like @entity208 carols and " we will rock you , " and i played notes with my fingers on the wall			0
i kept saying things that gave me courage like @entity220 's " i do believe i am seeking only @entity217 's truth and have lost all fear of man			0
" @entity0 : when you were let out of solitary , what happened ? @entity7 : they put me in another cell			1
@entity0 : and you were held for four months			1
what did you think when news came last week when the @entity2 president said that @entity15 and @entity15 were going to be released ? and what did you think when they were freed wednesday ? @entity7 : in @entity2 , you never believe it until you see it			1
i thought about their families			0
@entity0 : you 've talked to their families before			0
@entity7 : i could relate to how worried they were			1
my parents were in a similar situation			0
i wanted to comfort them and to explain what prison was like for me			1
@entity0 : what would you say to @entity15 and @entity15 now ? @entity7 : i 'd like to hear from them how their situation was			1
i hope that they are able to adapt well in this new part of their life and perhaps learned lessons in prison that can help them when they 're free			1
i would tell them to take their time and not feel pressured to make decisions			0
it 's theirs again .			0
