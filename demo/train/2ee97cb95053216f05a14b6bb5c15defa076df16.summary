-- for the better part of four years , voters have said the no. 1 issue is the economy			1
for the past year , the economy has been the @entity7 's primary point of attack against president @entity9			1
for months , the economy and job creation has been @entity13 's calling card			1
so now that the president has stepped out and voiced support for marriage equality , we 're going to see if the economy and jobs remain the top issue or if the direction of this election has been permanently altered by @entity9 's historic remarks			1
remember , @entity7 characterized the war on women as a @entity26 strategy to divert attention from the " real issue " of the economy			0
over the next couple of days , we 'll see if the @entity7 will be as dismissive with gay rights			0
or will the fact that in 2004 , @entity32 successfully used discrimination against the gay - lesbian - bisexual - transgender ( @entity37 ) community to motivate his base be too juicy a strategy for @entity13 and the gang to pass up ? keep in mind that a @entity0 / @entity44 poll taken in late march showed gay rights was tied for dead last in what voters felt was the most important issue , so if the @entity7 does try to use @entity9 's remarks as weapons against him , there is a good chance the rhetoric will fall on deaf ears			1
perhaps @entity13 said it best himself , during a big primary night victory speech in april : " it 's still about the economy and we 're not stupid			1
" but it 's @entity13 speaking , and he 's never been married to any position for very long -- pun intended			2
in 1994 , when he referred to himself as a moderate , @entity13 told the @entity61 -- a @entity37 organization -- that he 'd be better than sen. @entity62 on gay rights			2
wednesday , he reiterated his views in his latest incarnation as a conservative by saying that he 's against marriage equality and civil unions			0
so whether or not @entity13 actually stays focused on the economy is anyone 's guess			1
this probably explains why @entity9 holds double - digit leads over @entity13 on likeability , honesty , confidence , values and leadership -- and that was before @entity9 's courageous interview with @entity81 on @entity83 's " @entity82			1
" even in the one area where on paper @entity13 has significant credibility -- the economy -- 44 % of voters believe the president will do a better job , while 42 % prefer @entity13 , according to a @entity0 poll			2
if @entity13 ca n't get any more traction from his calling card , nor a boost from his vice presidental selection , there is the possibility the economy will take a backseat to gay rights in his campaign			1
assuming of course , it has n't already			0
i guess we 'll have to wait and see what kind of ads begin to emerge and what he says on the trail once the initial dust has settled			0
but what is clear is that president @entity9 is no coward			2
critics can question the timing of his remarks but the reality is , he did n't have to state his support for marriage equality before the election			1
even with reporters dogging him at every news conference because of the remarks on same - sex marriage made by vice president @entity125 over the weekend , all @entity9 had to say was " i 'm getting there " and we would 've moved on			2
but in embracing a view most assumed he had anyway , @entity9 places his core convictions ahead of political expediency			0
that 's very rare to see in an election year			0
what he did took a great deal of courage , especially considering that a recent @entity137 poll showed 48 % of @entity138 are against same - sex marriages and that @entity140 , a swing state he barely won four years ago , just voted against marriage equality and civil unions , with a vote of 61 % to 39 %			0
but because of that , @entity9 further separates himself from his opponent -- whose biggest weakness has been his perceived lack of conviction about matters of importance -- and moves closer to the @entity151 , @entity152 , @entity153 and @entity154 realm of presidents : men who risked a great deal personally to move the country forward socially			2
and given the fact that he can point to the 12 consecutive months of job losses before taking office and the 26 consecutive months ( and counting ) of job growth since 2010 , there 's no reason to believe the economy will cease to be his campaign 's top focus			0
we 'll find out if the @entity7 agrees			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity173 .			0

@entity173 : for years , the economy has been seen as the *dominant* issue
he asks if @entity9 's support for gay marriage will change the @entity13 camp 's direction
@entity184 : @entity9 showed he is no coward ; he did n't have to address the issue before election
he says the move separates @entity9 from @entity13 , whose flip *flops* have been an issue
