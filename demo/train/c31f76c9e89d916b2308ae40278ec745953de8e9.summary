-- @entity1 joined the likes of @entity3 , @entity4 and @entity5 on thursday when the trio was -- finally -- inducted into the @entity7			1
having been eligible for a nomination since 1998 , the honor was a long time coming for @entity1 and loyal fans of the @entity12 band			1
" this is a little overwhelming for a nice @entity18 boy from @entity19 , " lead vocalist @entity13 said before thanking " the most passionate , most dedicated , incredible fan base around the globe			1
" guitarist @entity20 delivered an acceptance speech consisting entirely of different speeds and intonations of the words " blah blah blah , " which still somehow managed to convey the story of being surprised that the band was finally being inducted and thanking the fans for all of their support			1
even backstage @entity20 did n't speak another word			1
" believe me , that 's a blessing , " @entity13 said			2
@entity31 , @entity32 , @entity33 , @entity34 and @entity35 also joined the exclusive club on thursday			1

" our mission was basically to inspire , to teach , to do something that we have n't done in music , or even in the rap game , was to bring about a unity , a collective effort , so that we can fight the power			2
" @entity55 @entity54 , praised @entity35 for changing " everything about the emerging urban musical force called rap			1
" he applauded group members @entity42 , @entity60 , @entity61 , professor @entity62 and @entity63 for using the medium at their disposal to speak the truth and " inspire others to take on the forces of oppression that separate us and try to suffocate progressive and radical thought			2
" @entity60 , who wore a white tuxedo identical to his son 's , acknowledged his trademark accessory during his lengthy acceptance speech			2
this is the " last night that you see me wearing this particular clock , yes , because ... this is going into the @entity7 , " he said pointing to the clock , with a white bezel and black face , that was hanging around his neck			1
he quickly added : " yes , i will put another clock on , y'all know that			2
" there were performances by the inductees and musical tributes like the @entity96 performing in full @entity1 regalia of white satin and wigs , @entity91 singing @entity89 's " @entity88 " and @entity90 performing some of @entity34 's biggest hits including " @entity101			1

" sometimes i 'm not home , sometimes i 'm touring			0
... to me , it 's maddening			0
