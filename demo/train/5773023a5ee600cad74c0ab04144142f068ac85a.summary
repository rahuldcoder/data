idea : if you pay a million dollars in taxes , you should get a million votes			0
while some media outlets have since pointed out that @entity1 was perhaps courting controversy , his system of wealthier @entity10 having more say at the ballot box follows an equally bizarre argument this week from @entity13 , ceo of luxury retailer @entity14			1
@entity13 took a different tack on the inequality debate , asserting instead that all @entity10 are wealthy			1
according to @entity13 , " we 've got a country that the poverty level is wealth in 99 % of the rest of the world			2
so we 're talking about woe is me , woe is us , woe is this			0
... the guy that 's making , oh my @entity27 , $ 35,000 a year			0
... why do n't we try that out in @entity30 or some country we ca n't even name ... @entity33 , anyplace -- that guy is wealthy			0
" for now , it 's safe enough to assume that @entity1 ' dollar - a - vote initiative is unlikely to take off			1
but @entity13 's argument actually falls into a growing category -- members of the wealthiest income group in the country trying to convince average @entity10 that they , too , are all very wealthy			1
last summer , a commercial funded by the conservative @entity42 tried to persuade people that the middle class in @entity10 is actually rich by pointing out that someone making over $ 34,000 -- a decidedly middle - class income -- was part of " the wealthiest 1 % in the world			1
" seriously ? let 's look more closely at this idea that the poor -- or even the middle class -- in @entity10 are actually wealthy			1
@entity13 's argument probably does not hold much weight among millions of @entity10 who skipped filling a prescription in 2012 because of the costs , according to @entity58 's @entity57			1
nor does it likely ring true for many in the middle class who are trying to buy a home at a time when home prices have doubled since 1970			1
and let 's not forget the cost of a public four - year college education , which has risen by an eye - watering 250 % over the past 30 years			0
the federal poverty level in the @entity10 for a family of four is $ 23,550 , significantly less than estimated living expenses			2
more than 3 million @entity10 earn the minimum wage or lower , and today 's minimum wage has 30 % less buying power in real terms than the minimum wage in 1968			1
or put another way , someone on minimum wage would have to work for more than 130 hours to buy the $ 950 dress that @entity83 's company is selling right now at @entity84			0
to be sure , @entity10 do not need to buy luxury dresses			2
but they do need to buy food			0
and according to the @entity10 @entity87 , more than 14 % of @entity10 were food insecure at some point in 2012			2
in other words , in the wealthiest country on @entity91 , millions of @entity10 could not be sure where their next meal was coming from			2
and poverty is much more prevalent than you might think -- more than half of @entity10 between the ages of 25 and 64 will spend a year of their lives in or near poverty			2
as worrisome as these statistics are on @entity10 poverty levels , there is also alarming data about the state of the middle class			1
median incomes in @entity10 are actually lower now than they were in 2000 , and household debt levels have skyrocketed			1
if we look at millennials -- the youngest part of our workforce -- there were 10 million of them who were unemployed or underemployed last summer , more than the entire population of @entity116			0
@entity117 would have us make with developing countries miss the point			0
the @entity10 is not a developing country , and it does not serve us well to try to ignore the real difficulties of many @entity10			2
so the question is not whether a full - time retail worker earning $ 14,000 in @entity124 is better off than a full - time retail worker in @entity30 , or even whether a household with $ 34,000 in @entity127 is doing better than many families in @entity33			0
the question is whether the economic conditions we have now are serving us -- all of us -- well			0
and the answer to that is : not really			0
or , more positively : we can certainly do better			0
economic growth in the @entity10 is lagging behind our historical average , and unemployment five years from the @entity136 is still too high			1
and the @entity137 , the notion that if you work hard and play by the rules you can get ahead , is taking a serious knock when economic mobility -- the ability to move from the wealth you were born to another level -- is lower in the @entity10 than in countries like @entity148 and @entity149			1
doing better for all @entity10 is not about creating divisions between income levels			0
and it 's certainly not about trying to convince workers who are struggling to pay their rent that they are actually rich			0
simply put , doing better for all @entity10 -- the wealthiest included -- and growing our economy in a sustainable way requires a growing and vibrant middle class that is contributing to an innovative and entrepreneurial workforce , while providing a stable source of economic demand			1
in short , we need @entity10 to be both productive workers and reliable consumers			0
acknowledging the very real struggles many of our fellow @entity10 face is not just a moral imperative , it is also an economic one			1
and we ca n't have a constructive conversation about how we improve the country 's economy if we ignore the difficult realities facing many @entity10 today			2
@entity13 and @entity1 can disparage their fellow citizens all they want , but the truth is that the @entity10 economy will do better when more @entity10 are doing better			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity175 .			0

@entity175 : the rich like @entity1 and @entity13 live in a *bubble*
@entity175 : @entity13 's idea that the poor in @entity10 are actually wealthy is ludicrous
she says median incomes in @entity10 are lower now than they were in 2000
@entity175 : without a vibrant middle class , @entity10 will fall behind in economic growth
