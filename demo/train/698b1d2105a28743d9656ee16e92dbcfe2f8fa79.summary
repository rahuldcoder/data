@entity0 -- tensions between @entity3 and @entity4 worsened thursday when @entity3 prime minister @entity5 said his country would follow aid ships to @entity8 trying to break the @entity4 blockade			1
it comes as @entity4 officials said @entity3 had expelled three diplomats from the @entity3 capital of @entity14			0
relations between the two countries have deteriorated since a raid on a @entity3 ship carrying aid to @entity8 last year when @entity4 commandos killed eight @entity3 and one @entity3 @entity21			1
a @entity23 investigation into the incident found that the @entity4 blockade of @entity8 is a " legitimate security measure " in compliance with international law , but it said that @entity4 had used " excessive and unreasonable " force			1
@entity4 prime minister @entity30 said the recent increase in tensions between the two countries " was not our choice " but added that @entity4 had the right to defend its coast and to prevent smugglers and flotillas reaching the @entity8			1
@entity1 asked @entity39 , associate fellow and @entity41 at @entity42 in @entity0 -- a @entity44 institute for the independent analysis of international issues -- for his take on @entity3 's relationship with @entity4			1
what led to the souring of relations between @entity3 and @entity4 ? " @entity3 was the first @entity52 - majority country to establish diplomatic relations with @entity4 in march 1949			2
since then , bilateral relations reflected the regional conditions in the @entity56			2
as the @entity56 peace process blossomed in the 1990s , both countries enjoyed close political , economic and military ties			0
" however , bilateral relations deteriorated after @entity4 's military operations in @entity8			1
they took a turn for the worse when @entity4 naval commandos intercepted the @entity3 ship @entity65 en route to breach the @entity4 blockade of @entity8			1
that incident led to the deaths of eight @entity3 and one @entity70			0
" @entity4 refused @entity3 's demand for an apology but agreed to express regret and pay compensation for the @entity65 victims			2
" how serious is the pledge to escort aid ships ? " the @entity3 prime minister has threatened to send naval warships to escort future civilian aid ships heading to @entity8			1
so far , @entity3 seems to be sabre - rattling			0
but the risk of a naval confrontation between @entity4 and @entity3 in the future can not be totally discounted			0
" how does this affect relations between the two countries ? " @entity3 's downgrading of diplomatic relations with @entity4 signals a major escalation of @entity3 - @entity4 tensions with @entity4			1
thus far , @entity4 's response to the @entity3 sanctions has been muted but may react if @entity3 raises the stakes further			2
" who has the most to lose ? " @entity3 's suspension of military ties with @entity4 will not have an immediate impact since there are no major outstanding defence contracts or joint military exercises between both countries			1
" a more immediate impact is the loss of intelligence - sharing between @entity4 and @entity3 , but it is likely the @entity21 will try to minimize the implications on intelligence cooperation			1
" @entity4 does not wish to lose access to @entity3 's $ 700 billion economy , one of the largest in the @entity56			2
" similarly , @entity3 is not keen for the time being to diminish business opportunities and the web of private sector interests with @entity4 at a time of challenging economic conditions			0
" for example , the northwestern province of @entity119 has started manufacturing the @entity121 , an electric car from @entity123 and @entity124 , thanks to a deal signed with the @entity4 company @entity127			0
" however , the escalation of tensions may eventually undermine bilateral trade beyond the loss of @entity4 tourism to @entity3 and defence deals between both countries			2
" is @entity5 playing to a home audience and if so why ? " prime minister @entity5 is keen to portray @entity3 as a leader in the @entity56 and the @entity52 world			2
his self - confidence has grown immeasurably since winning a decisive victory in the general elections of june 2011			0
part of his popularity stems from an assertive and confrontational attitude towards @entity4			0
" what are the regional implications ? " @entity3 's tensions with @entity4 come at time of uprisings in @entity149 , @entity150 and @entity151			1
in the short term , prime minister @entity5 's popularity among @entity153 and @entity154 may experience a temporary surge			1
" longer term , if the @entity21 is successful in managing the fallout in @entity4 - @entity3 relations , then regional implications will be contained			1
" has the ' @entity161 ' had a bearing on this relationship ? " the @entity3 - @entity4 relations predated the so - called @entity161			0
they were on a downward spiral since the @entity4 military intervention in @entity8			0
" what about @entity3 's relationship with the @entity171 -- does this affect its desire to join the @entity171 ? " @entity3 's confrontation with @entity4 has no bearing on its already fractious and challenging relationship with the @entity171			0
@entity177 and @entity178 opposition to @entity3 aspirations to join the @entity171 has brought the process to a standstill			0
@entity3 's chances of membership looked slim prior to the recent escalation of tensions with @entity4			0

@entity23 *report* found @entity4 blockade of @entity8 " legitimate " but was critical of " excessive force "
@entity39 says bilateral relations suffered as a result of military action in @entity8
he *believes* the @entity3 prime minister 's popularity partly stems from his stance on @entity4
@entity39 says if the @entity21 manages the situation , then regional implications can be contained
