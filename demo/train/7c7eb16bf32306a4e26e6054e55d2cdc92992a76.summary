-- today , when i turned on the news , i watched in horror as @entity4 marched toward @entity5			1
almost every news channel covered the story and the potential damage @entity4 could wreak on an already injured @entity5			1
we 'll soon know whether @entity10 has decided to spare her from @entity4 , but more storms will threaten , and @entity5 still needs our help			1
@entity5 's plight has always been close to my heart			1
it is the country of my birth and i am passionate about it			2
as we face this latest potential disaster , however , i find myself asking an uncomfortable question : where has @entity5 been in the national and international news ? after the devastating earthquake in 2010 , the people of the world opened up their hearts , minds , and wallets and pledged help to @entity5			1
ordinary citizens near and far , celebrities , politicians donated time , energy , and money to disaster relief causes and organizations			2
for a while the spotlight was on @entity5 , but lately there 's been next to nothing			1
i do n't mean to say that there are n't people and organizations still committed to @entity5			1
organizations such as @entity44 , @entity45 , the @entity46 , @entity47 , @entity48 , @entity49 , @entity50 , @entity52 's @entity51 organization , and we advance , just to name a few , have done and continue to do outstanding work			0
but after the earthquake , most ( including the media ) stopped paying attention , either believing they had done all they could , or maybe because they were simply tired or overwhelmed			0
today , almost three years later , there are more than 400,000 refugees still living in hundreds of tent cities , where sanitation is primitive and life is dangerous			1
health issues abound ; wrecked buildings and rubble remain			0
while the nation 's current president has done an admirable job at letting the world know that @entity5 is " open for business , " the problems facing the country remain enormous			1
the $ 2.1 billion raised in the earthquake relief effort may seem like a staggering sum , but we have to remember the scale and the magnitude of the devastation -- the total destruction of @entity5 's minimal infrastructure			1
the task of rebuilding remains gargantuan			0
for example , people have stayed in tent cities that sprang up in @entity89 and elsewhere because they have nowhere else to go			0
these places are fraught with dangers for women and children in particular			0
many have left and are homeless			0
some have moved into transitional shelters , but these must give way at some point to a more permanent solution			0
the government and charity organizations need more time and locations to build stable and secure homes and move the displaced			0
@entity105 , which broke out in the year after the quake and has claimed thousands of lives and sickened hundreds of thousands , remains a constant threat because there is limited access to fresh water and sanitation			1
this , even though an admirable job has been done to contain the disease 's spread			0
this year 's rainy season has touched off new concerns about its re-emergence , and the coming storm can only make matters worse			0
this week , @entity5 has returned once again to the national and international consciousness			2
this time , let 's not forget			0
whatever happens in the storm -- and we hope for the best -- @entity4 can remind us that things do n't change unless we remain active and continue to bring attention to the causes we believe in			2
the hardest part is always rebuilding -- and @entity5 can not effectively rebuild if she does n't get the attention she deserves			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity134 .			2

@entity134 : @entity4 could renew *misery* of quake - damaged nation
he says @entity5 *largely* forgotten again , now that quake story receded , but still needs help
he says @entity5 still living in tents , with poor sanitation , ever present threat of *cholera*
@entity134 : as a new disaster looms , the world must remember @entity5
