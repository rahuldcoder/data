@entity1 , @entity0 -- thousands of people marched through @entity1 thursday as part of a 24 - hour nationwide strike to protest further austerity measures by the embattled government			1
the strike began at midnight and caused all government - run institutions -- including schools , airports , trams , subways , and most buses -- to close down			1
banks and the media were also shut , meaning no broadcast news thursday and no newspapers friday			0
there were small clashes with police and protesters threw two petrol bombs at officers in @entity25 , in front of the @entity28 building			1
police fired some tear gas and pepper spray in return , but otherwise the march was relatively calm			0
sixteen people were arrested and two police officers were injured , police told @entity2			0
many people appeared to be suffering from the tear gas			0
the protesters are angry about further government measures aimed at cutting @entity0 's massive deficit			1
they oppose the cutting of benefits and salaries , and the raising of taxes , and want more of the measures to be aimed at the wealthy			2
the government says @entity0 has to modernize its tax structure as the country suffers from tax avoidance and other structural impediments to job growth			1
but younger workers say they already pay high taxes , have little job security and make less money than older generations			0
some of the same measures prompted large demonstrations and some violence two weeks ago , but polls at the time still showed the majority of @entity0 backing the government plans			1
since then , government has introduced a third round of austerity measures in @entity28 amounting to $ 6.5 billion of cuts and tax increases , and that has caused support for the government to slip -- polls now show only a bare majority in favor of the government 's actions			1
the @entity0 government revealed late last year that its budget deficit was 12.7 percent of its gross domestic product , far exceeding the @entity78 limit of 3 percent			2
countries participating in the @entity78 must agree to that condition and other economic goals			0
@entity0 aims to reduce that deficit to 8.7 percent this year and reach the @entity78 target by 2012			2
thursday 's strikes were rescheduled from march 16 , when @entity78 officials plan to go to @entity1 and assess @entity0 's financial pledges to @entity87			1
protesters moved the strikes to thursday in order to maximize disruption , because both public and private sector workers would be able to strike			0
the @entity0 government has said it will not back down in the face of strikes			2
