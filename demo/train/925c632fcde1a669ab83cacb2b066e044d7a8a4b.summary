@entity1 , @entity0 -- the last survivor of the @entity5 , 97 - year - old @entity3 , is auctioning off her remaining mementos of the doomed ship to pay nursing home bills			1
@entity3 , 97 , is trying to raise money so she can stay in the nursing home she prefers			1
the auction , which is expected to raise up to $ 50,000 for her , is set to take place saturday near her home in @entity0			1
it is the second auction in less than a year for @entity16 , who was a 9 - week - old when the ship sank on its maiden voyage in 1912			1
among the items going under the hammer at @entity21 is a canvas bag that might have been used to lift the infant @entity16 from a lifeboat to a rescue ship , said @entity25 of the auction house			1
" historical documents say she was lifted from the lifeboat onto @entity30 , the rescue ship , in a mail sack , " @entity21 said			0
after her rescue , @entity16 , her mother and her brother returned to @entity0 with a canvas sack , among other possessions			0
" there is speculation that this would have been the bag			0
it 's a leather and canvas bag			1
you would easily get a child or infant in it , " @entity21 said , though he added that research by the @entity48 , the @entity49 and the @entity50 showed no proof that @entity16 had been taken off the lifeboat in that particular bag			0
given that the auctioneer can not prove @entity16 was rescued in the bag , " we expect it to fetch £ 3,000 ( $ 4,480 )			1
if it was the bag she was rescued in , it would be £ 30,000 to £ 40,000 , ( $ 44,800 to $ 60,000 ) , but we ca n't prove it			1
it depends on what people are prepared to believe			0
" @entity21 said he was eager to raise as much for @entity16 as possible			2
" she 's in a residential nursing home			2
she 's 97 years of age			1
she 's paying £ 3,000 a month in nursing home fees , " he said -- the amount he hopes her canvas bag will sell for			2
" as she said , £ 3,000 a month is £ 36,000 a year , which is a lot of money , " he said			2
" when she runs out of money , the state will pay fees for her , but while she can pay her fees , she decides where she gets her care			0
when the state pays , they decide			0
" @entity16 's previous sale , in october , raised just over £ 30,000 , @entity21 said			2
" it 's made a lot of people aware of her plight ; a lot of people have sent her funds , " he said			2
@entity16 never married and had no children			0
" there are cousins , but there is no one directly to support her , " @entity21 said			0
" the property she lived in [ before she moved to the nursing home ] was not hers			0
she 's just an ordinary little old lady			2
" if she 's lucky , she 'll get another four or five years ; she 's quite a fit lady , " he said			0
@entity16 was not available to speak to @entity2 herself because of a throat infection , @entity21 said			0
the auction will include 17 items from her collection , most of them memorabilia related to the @entity5 and signed by her but not from the ship itself			1
the auction , in @entity113 , southwest @entity0 , will also include a collection of letters from the estate of @entity5 survivor @entity117 , estimated to fetch £ 40,000 to £ 60,000 ( $ 60,000 to $ 90,000 )			1
the letters include descriptions of her family 's trip to board the @entity5 and the immediate aftermath of the sinking			1
@entity117 , who was 10 months old when the ship went down , died in october 2007 , the auctioneer said .			0

97 - year - old was 9 weeks old when @entity5 sank in 1912
saturday 's auction is expected to raise up to $ 50,000 for her
letters from estate of another survivor will also be on the block
