@entity0 -- although domestic issues may continue to dominate the presidential campaign , eventually the candidates will be called upon to give a comprehensive view of @entity7 national security interests and defend those views in a presidential debate			1
@entity7 will want to know : what is each candidate 's vision of @entity14 's role in the world and which candidate is better suited to be our commander in chief ? the stakes are high , even if public attention is not			1
the @entity21 is quaking from a cascade of revolutions			0
@entity24 is inching ever closer to having a nuclear bomb			0
@entity26 is rising , prompting countries across the region to both engage with it and hedge against it			0
@entity33 's power has shattered , yet its fragments remain dangerous			0
sustained economic growth is transforming countries across @entity37 and @entity14 , while @entity38 , @entity39 and @entity40 grow in global influence			1
@entity42 appears to be turning inward , as financial crises create economic constraints and political turmoil			0
global energy markets are changing dramatically , with the @entity7 now importing more than twice as much oil from the @entity48 as it does from the @entity49			1
whatever the outcome of the november election , @entity14 's next president must confront these changes			1
at a time of fiscal constraint and political divisiveness , the next president and his administration must lay out a vision that matches national means to national ends -- in other words , a grand strategy			2
grand strategies assess the international and domestic environments , define @entity7 interests in these environments and recommend ways and means to secure those interests			2
they explain @entity14 's role in the world and how to think about that role			1
and they provide a vision for how @entity14 should build and marshal all the relevant elements of national power and leverage assets in one area to achieve goals in another			0
they are a map for getting things done			0
as president @entity86 and former @entity88 gov. @entity87 articulate their respective grand strategies , they will need to confront five big questions about @entity7 national security : 1			2
what are the most significant threats and opportunities facing the @entity7 ? how serious and immediate is the threat posed by @entity24 ? is terrorism still the greatest threat to the @entity7 or is @entity33 on the ropes ? what does the rise of @entity26 portend for @entity7 interests ? does the @entity102 represent an opportunity or a threat to longstanding interests -- or both ? what should the @entity7 do to reduce violence and drug trafficking in the @entity48 ? how can @entity7 derive greater prosperity from today 's interconnected global economy ? how should the @entity7 engage pivotal states such as @entity38 , @entity40 , @entity113 and @entity39 ? 2			1
when should @entity14 engage and when should it isolate ? is the dual - track approach to @entity24 -- negotiate and sanction -- the right one ? are sanctions in general useful ? should @entity7 diplomats engage with foes such as @entity24 or the @entity119 or fear that doing so will convey legitimacy upon them ? what is the right level of engagement and pressure in the @entity7 relationship with @entity126 ? when is it appropriate to use military force and in what measure ? 3			1
how much defense do we need and how much can we afford ? what kinds of wars should our military prepare to fight in ? can we safely reject the prospect of large - scale land wars and counterinsurgency operations ? should @entity14 invest more in technologically advanced weaponry ? should pressure to cut the overall government budget determine the scale of defense spending ? how can we make our armed forces more effective and efficient in the future , regardless of the level of budget cuts ? 4			0
how can the @entity7 prosper in the global economy ? are trade agreements fundamentally good for the @entity7 and should @entity14 pursue more of them ? how should @entity0 deal with @entity26 's currency practices ? what threat does the eurozone crisis pose to the @entity7 economy , and what should the @entity7 do about it ? how will @entity14 's economic challenges affect our influence abroad ? what must the @entity7 do at home to make us more competitive globally ? 5			1
what role should human rights and democracy play in @entity7 foreign policy ? is the " freedom agenda " a thing of the past , or does it speak to longstanding traditions in @entity7 policy ? how does @entity14 balance its values and interests in countries such as @entity173 ? has the @entity102 demonstrated the importance of supporting democratic values in the @entity21 or has it illustrated the limits of doing so ? should the @entity7 be willing to use force to end atrocities in @entity179 ? in a new report published by the @entity182 , we asked four of @entity14 's leading strategists to grapple with questions like these			1
@entity186 argues that the @entity7 should continue to play a global leadership role , but that it can not afford to do everything and thus must be selective in its engagements			2
he calls for the @entity7 to focus its energies on providing what he calls " global public goods " that can not easily be provided by other countries and that benefit both the @entity7 and the world			2
these include protecting freedom of navigation on the seas , which undergirds the global economy , and helping to ensure peace among major powers , without which both security and economic prosperity will suffer			1
@entity207 , in contrast , calls for a more limited @entity7 role in the world			0
since today 's security threats are less severe than at other points in our history but @entity14 's fiscal challenges are intense , @entity207 calls on the @entity7 to rebuild its economic power and pull back from global military commitments			1
he argues that @entity14 should rebuild its " strategic solvency " -- the economic and fiscal ability to confront national security threats in the future			2
@entity221 calls for robust @entity7 engagement in the world and expresses concern that @entity7 sometimes overvalue the risks of intervening militarily and overlook the risks of not intervening			2
he argues that the @entity7 should dissuade the rise of a hostile peer rival , such as @entity26 , even as it engages @entity229 as a stakeholder in the international system			0
the @entity7 should do this from a position of strength -- what he calls the " velvet - covered iron fist			0
" to protect @entity7 leverage in the @entity239 and the @entity21 , he expresses deep concern about any erosion of @entity14 's military might and cuts to the @entity7 defense budget			1
@entity245 calls for the @entity7 to recognize that answering most of the questions raised above depends not just on @entity14 's diplomatic relations with other countries , but also on its ability to work with networks of nongovernmental organizations , businesses , religious groups , philanthropies and even individuals			1
the @entity7 derives enormous power from its influence in these networks and ability to attract students and entrepreneurs from around the world			0
at the same time , though , threats to the @entity7 emerge increasingly from powerful networks of criminals , arms dealers and terrorists			0
severing the links between nefarious networks and other , legitimate ones , is an important source of @entity7 power			0
while we share some of the authors ' views and differ on others , we all agree on this : as @entity7 prepare to vote for their next president in november , it is time for a vigorous debate about @entity7 grand strategy			1
in november , @entity7 will decide for themselves			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors			0

while campaign is focused on domestic issues , key foreign policy *choices* loom , say authors
they say @entity14 's next administration must identify key threats , opportunities
president will have to decide when to engage militarily or diplomatically , they say
authors : a key issue is what kind of strategy will help @entity7 prosper in global economy
