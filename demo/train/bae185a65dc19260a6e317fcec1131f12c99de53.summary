-- april 28 , 2010 download @entity2 maps related to today 's show : @entity4 @entity5 , @entity6 @entity7 , @entity8 transcript this is a @entity11			1
this copy may not be in its final form and may be updated			2
@entity15 , @entity16 : how long can you sit on a plane without it taking off ? the government has something to say about that subject			2
the story 's coming up in just a few minutes			1
@entity0 starts right now ! first up : @entity26 @entity27 : first up , a hearing gets heated on @entity29 over one company 's role in the financial crisis			1
@entity33 is , essentially , a bank			2
and it 's been one of the most successful companies on @entity37 for decades			1
just like a lot of banks , it took a major hit from the recession and needed help from the government -- a bailout -- in order for it to stay in business			2
@entity33 's been paying that money back			1
now , some lawmakers are questioning @entity33 about whether it had a role in the recession			2
during a @entity55 hearing yesterday , some of those questions got pretty tough			2
one senator accused @entity33 of serving itself instead of its clients			2
company executives insist that they did nothing wrong			2
that is just part of the controversy surrounding @entity33 right now			1
@entity63 has more for us on who and what are involved			2
christine ? ( begin video ) @entity68 , @entity69 business correspondent : @entity25 , this case is about the big housing crash , big money and , of course , big politics			2
the government agency called the @entity76 has charged one of the most powerful banks on @entity37 , @entity33 , with fraud			1
the case is complicated , so before we go any further , let 's look at the main characters of this story			1
@entity85 , the @entity76 , or the @entity76			2
it is a government agency in charge of regulating @entity37 and protecting investors			1
then , there 's that investment bank , @entity33 , one of the most profitable and revered players on @entity37			1
@entity33 earns money by making its own investments and by helping clients , usually other companies or pension funds or even governments , putting together their own deals			2
and a third character in this story , billionaire investor @entity102			2
so what happened here ? the @entity76 says that @entity33 misled its clients by selling them an investment product comprised of very bad mortgages			2
it allegedly did n't tell the clients that the product was put together by @entity102 , the billionaire , who hand - picked the mortgages and specifically wanted the product to go south			1
at the end , investors lost $ 1 billion and @entity102 made $ 1 billion			2
well , who cares ? well , @entity33 is accused of misleading those clients , and that is something that the @entity76 says is a problem			2
and @entity33 denies those charges , by the way			2
the company said in a statement , " the @entity76 's charges are completely unfounded in law and fact and we will vigorously contest them and defend the firm and its reputation			1
" @entity102 also says that his role in the deal was " appropriate and conducted in good faith			2
" to make the story even more interesting and more complicated , the @entity76 is now in a little bit of hot water , too			2
some republicans have implied that the agency may have timed these charges against @entity33 to help pass the financial reform legislation , a big issue on @entity29 these days , which all @entity132 currently oppose			0
the @entity76 defends its impartiality			0
but investigation of the investigation is now underway			0
on tuesday , executives from @entity33 were on @entity29 to answer questions from lawmakers separately			0
stay tuned for more news on this case			1
@entity25 ? ( @entity145 ) web promo @entity27 : thank you , @entity63			0
in that report , you heard ms. @entity63 mention " financial reform legislation			0
" this is something we 've talked about before			0
@entity153 is looking at ways to make some changes on @entity37 to try to avoid another financial crisis			1
the @entity55 is debating how to move forward on that bill			0
in the meantime , if you want to learn a little bit more about it , head to the @entity163 section on our home page			1
you will find an faq about the financial reform bill , how it might work , what parts of it @entity169 and @entity132 agree on			0
it 's all right there in the @entity163 section at @entity174			1
word to the @entity176 @entity177 , @entity16 : a word to the @entity176 ... tarmac ( noun ) a road , especially an airport runway , that 's paved with tar source : www.dictionary.com @entity186 @entity27 : a new rule about how long planes can sit on the tarmac with passengers on board is scheduled to go into effect tomorrow			1
how long is too long ? according to the @entity194 government , anything over three hours			0
airlines that hold planes longer than that could face a fine of up to $ 27,000 per passenger			0
transportation secretary @entity200 says passengers who are on delayed flights that are stuck on the tarmac " have a right to know they will not be held aboard a plane indefinitely			0
" a few years ago , there were several reports of planes waiting for takeoff for more than 10 hours			0
that 's part of what led to this new rule			1
airlines have said they 'll do their best to meet the rule			1
the head of the @entity218 saying it could lead to more inconvenience for customers			0
he argues airlines are more likely to cancel flights to avoid fines , and he says the rule puts a time deadline on safety - related activities			1
@entity194 @entity229 @entity27 : switching gears from planes to cars			0
the recession hit @entity194 car companies pretty hard , but things seem to be getting a little bit better			0
so far this year , the company has made over $ 2 billion			0
to compare , by this time last year , @entity237 had lost almost a billion and a half			0
the only part of the world where @entity237 made a profit last year was in @entity244			0
now , it 's making money in every region around the globe			1
but the company says keeping this pace might be hard , because the cost of the materials that @entity237 uses to make its vehicles is going up			0
over at @entity255 , plans are underway to upgrade five of the company 's auto plants			1
the goal would be for these locations to build what @entity255 calls a " new generation " of fuel - efficient engines			1
and that could lead to new jobs ; about 1,600 of them , according to @entity266 has cut about 34,000 jobs from its work force since the end of 2008			0
@entity271 @entity272 , @entity16 : today 's shoutout goes out to mr. @entity275 's global studies class at @entity276 in @entity277 , @entity278 ! " @entity281 " is a shortened version of what word ? you know how to play it ! is it : a ) @entity288 , b ) @entity286 , c ) verisimilitude or @entity290 ) university ? three seconds on the clock -- go ! @entity281 comes from university			1
that 's your answer and that 's your shoutout ! gpas & sports @entity27 : some of the varsity athletes at @entity300 in @entity5 , @entity6 might have known that			1
just like at most schools , if you want to stay on the team , you have to make the grade			0
but @entity300 has a unique and very public way of making sure students meet standards			1
@entity309 of affiliate @entity310 breaks down the situation			0
( begin video ) @entity313 , @entity314 : it 's the first thing you see on the school 's website : the grade point averages of @entity300 's athletic teams			1
at the top is volleyball at 3.33 ; at the bottom , men 's soccer at 2.42			1
all of them are expected to work in class as hard as they do on the field or court			0
@entity331 , @entity332 : it 's a cut - and - dry policy : you do n't have the grades , you do n't play			1
if sports are really important to you , you 're going to have your grades up			0
really , to do anything at @entity300 you have to have your grades up , so there is an incentive to keep your grades up , which i think is good			0
@entity343 : it 's not just the website			1
posters all around @entity300 show athletes with an academic theme			1
@entity350 , on the left , says the school 's approach has athletes pushing other athletes			1
@entity355 , @entity332 : if you have a teammate in class , and you see him , you 'll ask him , " what did you get on that test ? did you turn your homework in ? " stuff like that			0
you remind him , " you need to get that stuff turned in , because we need you on the team			0
" @entity343 : @entity300 began putting team gpas on the school 's website last year			1
now , very few teams lose players who let their gpas drop below 2.0			0
@entity375 , @entity377 principal : the freshmen see seniors , and the seniors tell them you do n't play here unless your grades are up , and so it becomes a culture			0
@entity387 , east union athletic director : there 's a stigma on athletes in today 's society that hey , it 's okay to slide by and not take care of business in the classroom			1
i do n't operate that way , and i think on this campus kids understand the fact that they 're not going to operate that way either			1
@entity343 : but it 's not just the students being pressured to keep their grades up			1
their coaches are being evaluated , as well , on how many of their players remain eligible			0
stay eligible , they might just end up on a poster			0
( @entity145 ) before we go @entity27 : all right			0
before we go , you might 've heard of the domino effect			0
one @entity8 school is putting it in action			1
you may think we 're showing this video just because it 's a huge domino display			2
and in part , you 're right : it is ; 27,000 dominoes were involved			0
but the real story about this is what those dominoes represent			0
dollars ; one dollar for each domino			0
over the past month , students at the school raised money to help out a school in @entity429 that they 'd partnered with a couple years back			1
so , you follow the effect : the students raise money , the money goes to @entity429 , and helps rebuild a school that was damaged in january 's earthquake			1
goodbye @entity27 : and all the dominoes fall into place			0
plus , this story was a great lesson that small efforts can add up to make a big difference			0
we hope the rest of your day is fantastic ! for @entity0 , i 'm @entity25 .			0
