@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity4 military footprint in the volatile northern @entity1 city of @entity0 has all but disappeared ahead of a year - end deadline to withdraw , raising questions about the security of a small contingent of @entity11 employees and contractors staying behind			1
the questions come as @entity1 and @entity4 officials welcomed what they have called in recent weeks a new phase in the @entity4 - @entity1 partnership			1
" we are absolutely committed to be your partner to the extent you want us to be , " vice president @entity17 told @entity1 prime minister @entity18 during a visit last week to @entity1			0
" we stand read to provide assistance			0
" the @entity11 mission in @entity0 is one of a handful of operations that takes over where the @entity4 military leaves off , and the missions together are considered one of the largest rollouts of manpower by the @entity4 since the rebuilding efforts in @entity36 and @entity37 following @entity38 the @entity39 , as the @entity11 mission is known , is taking over in some case where the military left off by providing assistance to the @entity1 government and training for the @entity1 military			1
at @entity0 , the questions about security come in the wake of routine insurgent rocket attacks in the days leading up to the departure of @entity4 troops			1
one attack resulted in the death of an @entity4 soldier and the wounding of at least four others , military officials have said			2
@entity58 : share your stories from @entity1 during a recent town hall meeting held at the base , contractors and security personnel asked about security measures			1
" are we going to be safe ? " one woman asked @entity68 lt. gen. @entity67 via a video - teleconference , which was attended by a @entity2 reporter and producer			0
she also asked @entity67 if he could assure them they would n't be overrun			0
@entity67 , who has been charged with overseeing @entity74 and military sales to @entity1 , told the woman -- and the larger audience -- that @entity4 officials will not be leaving the workers unprotected			1
a large private security force has been hired as part of the effort to protect the thousands of @entity11 workers and contractors staying behind after the january 1 , 2012 , withdrawal deadline			1
while violence has fallen off across much of @entity1 , bombings and shootings remain a near - daily occurrence in @entity0 , which is home to nearly a third of the country 's oil reserves			2
@entity0 is populated by ethnic @entity93 , @entity94 and @entity95			0
tensions among the groups run high in the city , to which the @entity1 government in @entity100 and the semi-autonomous @entity102 region have both laid claim			0
the meeting , held in november just days before the last @entity4 troops left the compound , came as the base was undergoing a transformation			2
" there is no more operations center			0
there are no battle captains			0
there are no more commanders			0
there are no more military titles on the base , " army col. @entity116 told @entity2 during a recent interview at @entity118			1
in fact , @entity116 -- who is the military liaison for the base -- is not referred to by his rank , but rather his title , site lead for the @entity39 , @entity0			1
" at any given time , a few weeks ago you would see a couple hundred soldiers moving in and out " of the base housing area , @entity116 said during the tour			0
" right now , we barely see one			0
" even the name of the base is in transition			0
@entity118 , once a bustling foothold for the @entity4 military , is currently known as @entity0 , said @entity139 , the installation manager			1
the idea is to remove the @entity4 military association that @entity1 and others have with the base , @entity139 said			1
" our mission is to support the @entity1 operations			2
we do not have a combat mission			2
period , " @entity116 told @entity2			2
during a tour of the base , there were numerous signs that the @entity4 mission in @entity0 -- and in @entity1 , as a whole -- was changing almost overnight			1
the size of the base had been reduced , and the @entity11 mission there now refers to itself as a " tenant of @entity1			1
" " we are going to be a small tenant , a small operating cell , " @entity159 said			0
the @entity1 air force was taking over a large portion of the base , including the air field			2
civilian contractors were taking over where the military left off and training @entity1 air traffic controllers			1
while much of the @entity4 military presence has been wiped away at the base , a salute to fallen @entity4 troops will remain			1
at the center of the compound , more than a dozen giant concrete blast walls ring an area that will be used as a public gathering spot			0
the walls , painted black , bear the names -- in yellow paint -- of every @entity4 service member killed in @entity1			2
@entity183 : coalition casualties in @entity185 , @entity1 the name of the last @entity4 soldier killed in @entity0 , 1st lt. @entity188 , was added to the walls just days before the troops left			1
" these walls were actually located around different parts of the base , " @entity116 said , surveying the memorial that is reminiscent of the @entity193 memorial in @entity194			0
" when we had a mission to close the footprint of @entity0 , we decided to bring these walls in , " he said			2
" we are going to maintain this memorial until our mission is terminated			0
" @entity2 's @entity203 contributed to this report .			0

the @entity11 is taking over where the @entity4 military leaves off as it withdraws from @entity1
" we do not have a combat mission . period , " the military liaison in @entity0 tells @entity2
the base , formerly known as @entity118 , is now called @entity0
questions about the security and safety of contractors are being raised as the @entity4 military leaves
