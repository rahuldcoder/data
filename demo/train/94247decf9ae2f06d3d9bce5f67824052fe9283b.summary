@entity0 , @entity1 -- the release of a secretly recorded tape of @entity5 speaking to campaign donors highlights a risk facing the @entity8 -- of becoming perceived as the party of mean			1
after a vicious assault from @entity20 that portrayed @entity5 as a vulture capitalist who cared little about saving middle - class jobs , his remarks to a group of campaign donors about the 47 % of @entity15 who do n't pay taxes being dependent on government handouts only intensified the perception that he represents a party that is uninterested in protecting average @entity15			1
a @entity27 editorial characterized @entity5 as a " class warrior " seeking to " protect the rich by turning the working poor and middle class into the enemy			1
" @entity5 's problem is one that @entity8 have been struggling with more broadly for years			1
many in the party have forgotten an essential element of @entity38 's legacy : his insistence that conservatism had to be packaged as a positive force , as an argument about how to expand the global rights of individuals and make all @entity15 families more secure			1
he was determined to appeal to middle - and working - class @entity15 who were not satisfied with the @entity20			2
opinion : the true difference between @entity48 , @entity5 @entity38 was acutely aware of the need to present this kind of argument for conservatism , because he had vivid memories of the 1964 presidential campaign , when @entity8 sen. @entity55 was devastated by @entity57 's attacks on him as a radical extremist			1
on the campaign trail and in the @entity60 , @entity38 was always conscious of articulating a vision of conservatism that offered more than just an agenda of gutting social programs or only protecting the " national interest " through brute force			1
on foreign policy , @entity38 spoke of a tough anti-communism that would protect the rights of those who lived under @entity71 totalitarianism			2
he embraced the rhetoric of neoconservatism by championing a strong stand against the @entity71 as a way to protect democracy around the world			0
he drew on the language that conservatives had used since the 1940s , focusing on the need to free oppressed people in places like @entity84			0
@entity38 also talked about the quest for abolishing nuclear arms , a cause that he had supported for much of his adult life			2
he emphasized " peace through strength " as a reason to resist what he considered reckless arms negotiations and building up @entity15 's defense arsenal so the @entity15 could win the concessions that would be needed from the @entity71 to draw down nuclear weapons			0
as @entity38 said in his stirring , impromptu 1976 speech at the @entity8 convention , telling the delegates what people would be thinking a hundred years from then if they read a letter he put into a time capsule , " will they look back with appreciation and say , ' thank @entity106 for those people in 1976 who headed off that loss of freedom , and kept us now 100 years later free , who kept our world from nuclear destruction ? " @entity38 employed the same kind of rhetoric on domestic policy			1
his principal economic policy , supply - side economics , focused on cutting taxes on the wealthy with the promise that it would stimulate economic growth for everyone and bring more revenue into the federal government without raising taxes			0
" this administration 's objective , " @entity38 said in his inaugural address , " will be a healthy , vigorous , growing economy that provides equal opportunity for all @entity15 , with no barriers born of bigotry or discrimination			1
putting @entity15 back to work means putting all @entity15 back to work			0
" @entity38 had his hard edges for sure			2
he railed against " welfare queens , " a vision of poor women cheating the system of government benefits			0
he supported steep cuts in many domestic programs such as food stamps that aided the neediest @entity15			0
moreover , many of his arguments about supply - side economics were discredited and his foreign policy was much less consistent than he stated when it came to protecting democracy			0
opinion : @entity48 clueless on @entity152 turmoil but at least politically , @entity38 understood that @entity8 had to appeal to broad segments of the population , or they would lose			1
early in his presidency , @entity155 tried to bring back some of @entity38 's spirit with his ideas about " compassionate conservatism " as well as his use of human rights as a guide for foreign policy			1
yet many of his economic policies , including the tax cuts for the wealthy and effort to privatize @entity167 , as well as the immense problems of the war in @entity170 , undercut his ability to revive this vision of conservatism			0
without a positive message , conservatism faces the risk of seeming primarily like a harsh creed , an ideology for those who are intent on disciplining people who have supposedly become dependent on government			1
unfortunately for conservatives , that includes a huge array of @entity15 , from the elderly to defense contractors to young children in schools			0
if this rhetoric continues , the @entity8 is at risk of becoming the party that takes away government services , takes away immigration rights , takes away social rights , but does n't offer anything back			1
the 47 % speech played right into this theme			0
and the polls are all moving in the wrong direction for the @entity8			2
there are fewer and fewer voices such as former senate majority leader @entity201 , who recently , according to @entity202 , has been working hard to find bipartisan agreement on health care issues and who is publicly willing to acknowledge how the government is sometimes needed to alleviate problems			0
" as a doctor , " he wrote in @entity208 , " i strongly believe that people without health insurance die sooner			0
... state exchanges are the solution			0
" if the @entity8 ignores the kind of backlash it has encountered , it risks falling right back to 1964 or even 1932 , when @entity20 were able to paint @entity8 as a ruthless party only intent on protecting the prosperous			1
" our @entity8 leaders tell us economic lawsâ € ” sacred , inviolable , unchangeableâ € ” cause panics which one could prevent , " president @entity218 said in his inaugural address in 1932 , " but while they prate of economic laws , men and women are starving			2
we must lay hold of the fact that economic laws are not made by nature			0
they are made by human beings			0
" if @entity8 are not careful , @entity20 will find it easy enough to revitalize @entity218 's rhetorical assault and to make it extraordinarily difficult for @entity8 to regain control of @entity237			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity240 .			2

@entity240 : @entity5 's troubles *reflect* a problem @entity8 has been dealing with for years
a conservatism that emphasizes cutting social benefits risks appearing harsh , he says
@entity240 : @entity38 insisted conservatism be packaged as a positive force for freedom
he says @entity20 presidents have gained by depicting @entity8 as the party of meanness
