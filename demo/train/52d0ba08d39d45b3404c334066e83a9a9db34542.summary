@entity1 , @entity0 -- from a dust mask that tested positive for ricin , to an enigmatic dump of a coffee grinder , to talk of making and mailing " poison , " an affidavit unsealed tuesday shed light on the case against a @entity0 man accused of sending potentially deadly letters to president @entity13 and others			1
just more than a week ago , @entity15 described the man then jailed in the case -- an @entity16 , @entity17 and @entity18 impersonator named @entity20 -- as a " little nutty			1
" now @entity20 is free , and the 41 - year - old @entity15 is behind bars			1
the document unsealed tuesday explains what led authorities to arrest @entity15 -- but not why he allegedly concocted the poison and sent it to elected officials			1
read the affidavit lawyers for @entity15 did not respond immediately to @entity2 's calls tuesday for comment on the new details			1
but the affidavit in support of a criminal complaint indicated that his name was brought up as a possible suspect by none other than @entity20 , following the latter 's april 17 arrest			0
@entity20 had been detained on allegations that he was responsible for mailing letters with suspicious substances to @entity13 , sen. @entity44 , @entity0 , and @entity45 , a judge in @entity46 , @entity0			1
soon , though , authorities began to set their focus on @entity49 as well			0
that includes one person 's claim , made on april 19 to law enforcement agents , that @entity15 years ago said he could make a " poison , " the affidavit said			1
what is ricin ? " @entity15 stated that he could place the poison in envelopes and send them to elected officials , " said the witness , who had accused @entity15 of making sexual advances against his or her daughter			1
" ... according to the witness ... @entity15 made reference to having ' a secret knowledge ' for ' getting rid of people in office			2
' " document claims @entity15 repeatedly lied on april 22 , federal authorities searched a trash receptacle from @entity15 's @entity75 home and found , among other items , different types of yellow paper , address labels and a dust mask			1
the letters to @entity13 , @entity44 and @entity45 were all on yellow paper			2
that same day , @entity84 agents spotted @entity15 leaving his former tae kwon do facility , or dojo , loading things into his car , then placing several items from his window into a public trash can			1
according to the affidavit , these items included a coffee grinder , a box with latex gloves , a dust mask and an empty bucket of floor adhesive			1
three subsequent tests of the mask by the @entity103 came back positive for ricin , the document states			2
authorities further searched @entity15 's former tae kwon do dojo and tested six other samples , including liquid removed from a drain and swabs taken from inside the building			1
at the time , @entity15 told @entity2 affiliate @entity114 that he had agreed to the @entity84 search " to help clear my name			1
" " i had absolutely nothing to do with those letters , " he said			0
yet the affidavit states that laboratory tests showed five of the six samples taken from his dojo tested positive for ricin			1
the document alleges that @entity15 lied to authorities on other fronts as well			2
for example , he insisted that he had n't been back to his tae kwon do dojo since april 15 , before changing his story to say that he 'd returned briefly one week later for a mop bucket , two pails and a fire extinguisher			1
he also claimed he had not stopped while leaving that building on his way to a pawn shop and seemed to be flummoxed when authorities told him they 'd spotted him tossing items into a trash can			0
the affidavit also alludes to @entity15 's or his family 's possible frame of mind earlier this month , as seen in text messages on his wife 's cell phone			2
" we 're coming over to burn some things , " one such message from april 20 reads			0
another from the same day states , " we are gon na clean house			0
" twisted relationships and more the letters -- all postmarked april 8 -- each had a suspicious substance inside , a @entity156 , postmark and no return address			0
they also contained a letter that read , in part : " to see a wrong and not expose it , is to become a silent partner to its continuance			0
" on april 17 , authorities arrested @entity20			0
he emphatically denied sending the letters , insisting he 'd been framed and pointing the finger at @entity49			2
the two men knew each other because @entity15 used to work for @entity20 ' brother at an insurance company , under the direction of @entity20 ' ex-wife			2
@entity20 has said that while @entity15 worked for his brother , the two talked about collaborating on the publication of a book but later had a falling out			2
he has accused @entity176 of stalking him online , a claim the latter has denied			0
as for @entity15 , he told reporters last week that he did n't have a relationship with @entity20			2
" he 's just a little nutty , " he said			0
yet while the last line of the letters to @entity13 , @entity44 and @entity45 all contain @entity20 's signature online catchphrase -- " i am @entity185 and i approve this message " -- the newly unsealed affidavit ties them to @entity15			1
among them , it states that marks on the paper for all those letters match those of paper found in @entity15 's home and trash			2
businessman , musician and convicted criminal so who is @entity15 ? he 's held several jobs , including at the insurance company and owner of his tae kwon do dojo			1
the @entity207 described him as a musician			0
he was also an aspiring politician			0
he ran as a @entity209 against @entity211 state rep. @entity210 , the son of judge @entity45 , and lost			0
judge @entity45 dismissed a civil lawsuit that @entity15 had filed against the witness who told investigators that @entity15 had talked about " poison			1
" @entity15 is also no stranger to law enforcement			2
last year , residents in his @entity75 neighborhood sought police help after , one neighbor says , @entity15 repeatedly exposed himself to young girls			0
the case resulted in a conviction on indecent exposure charges and a 90 - day jail sentence			0
he 's appealed the conviction , according to the @entity207 newspaper			0
then came another arrest on january 18 , that is tied to the ricin case in two ways			0
in that case , according to a grand jury indictment handed up this month and obtained by @entity2 , @entity15 is accused of molesting three girls under the age of 16			2
this arrest prompted him to close his tae kwon do dojo			1
after the arrest , he consented to the seizure of his laptop computer , a hard drive and several flash drives , the affidavit in the ricin case states			0
investigators searched these and found that on @entity249 someone had downloaded a publication , " @entity252 for @entity253 , " about safely handling the toxin			0
they also found that another file , about a method for detecting ricin , had been downloaded about two hours later			0
but according to the affidavit , @entity15 insisted that he 'd never researched anything about ricin and that he 'd never even seen a castor bean			1
whether it was @entity15 or someone else , and whatever their motivation , the ricin - tainted letters could have done more than make headlines or scare people			1
if inhaled , injected or ingested , less than a pinpoint of ricin can kill a person within 36 to 48 hours due to the failure of the respiratory and circulatory systems			0
there is no known antidote			0
in a seeming acknowledgment of these dangers , the @entity84 issued a statement tuesday stating it had " immediately sealed off " @entity15 's former tae kwon do facility -- which is near an auto body shop and an ice cream parlor -- and contacted public health authorities in the interest of public safety			1
" the @entity84 is now conducting further forensic examination for the purpose of identifying trace evidence , residues and signatures of production that could provide evidence to support the investigation , " the agency said			1
@entity2 's @entity293 reported from @entity0 , and @entity294 wrote this story from @entity296 .			0

new : @entity84 says tae kwon do site is " sealed off " and that a forensic examination is *ongoing*
