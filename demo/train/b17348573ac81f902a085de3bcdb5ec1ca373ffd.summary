-- @entity1 has returned to fire up @entity2			0
the legendary @entity4 team has re-signed @entity5 to partner @entity6 in 2014			1
the @entity8 marque is replacing @entity10 @entity9 with its 2007 world champion as it seeks to end an era of @entity14 dominance			1
" @entity2 announces that it has reached an agreement with @entity5 , " read a statement on the team 's official website			1
" @entity19 will join @entity6 in the driver lineup for the next two racing seasons			2
" @entity5 spoke of his pleasure at returning to the team which had employed him between 2007 and 2009			1
" i am really happy to be returning to @entity25 where i previously spent three fantastic and very successful years , " @entity5 said			0
" i have so many memories of my time at @entity2 , memories which have stayed with me these past years			0
" i ca n't wait to be driving a @entity29 car again and to reacquaint myself with so many people with whom i had such close links			0
" old foes , new friends ? @entity2 will be the only team to race two world champions next season , making it the most potent , but potentially risky , pairing on the grid			0
commenting on his new teammate , @entity6 said : " i 'd like to welcome my new traveling companion : together , starting next year , we will have to tackle a very demanding technical and racing challenge			0
" @entity5 added that he considered the @entity43 double world champion , " a great driver			0
" @entity2 released @entity5 in 2009 -- ending his multimillion - dollar contract a year early -- to make way for @entity6 as its number one driver alongside @entity9			1
@entity5 said at the time he was " very sad " to leave @entity2 and he immediately quit @entity4 to pursue rallying			2
that backdrop feeds a fascinating dynamic between @entity5 and @entity6 as they work together as teammates next season			2
pairing @entity6 with another ambitious and capable driver is a risk -- a problem @entity57 had to face when it signed the @entity58 alongside @entity59 in 2007			0
@entity6 , who won back - to - back world titles with @entity61 in 2005 and 2006 , left @entity57 after a single season in which he and @entity59 fought over no. 1 status within the team			2
@entity2 president @entity65 had said earlier this year he did not want " two roosters in the same henhouse " but that view softened at last weekend 's @entity8 @entity69			1
@entity70 gave @entity5 the green light ahead of @entity9 and @entity73 's @entity72 , who had also been linked with a move to @entity2 next season			1
@entity9 , who was retained by @entity2 after recovering from a life - threatening head injury at the @entity76 , announced his departure monday			2
the 32 - year - old revealed on his @entity79 account : " from 2014 i will no longer be driving for @entity2			0
" i would like to thank the team for all the victories and incredible moments experienced together			0
" right now i want to push as hard as possible with @entity2 for the remaining seven races			0
for next year , i want to find a team that can give me a competitive car to win many more races and challenge for the championship which remains my greatest objective ! " @entity5 , who has won two races since returning to @entity4 with @entity90 in 2011 , will be determined to fight for victories -- something @entity9 has struggled to do alongside @entity6			1
the @entity10 , who has spent eight years at @entity2 , has not won a race during his tenure as @entity6 's teammate while the former @entity61 star has won 11 grands prix since joining @entity2 in 2010			1
@entity5 -- nicknamed " the @entity99 " -- is not expected to be cowed by @entity6 's strong personality or his abilities on track			1
@entity2 will hope their " fire and ice " combination will bring out the best in each other as it seeks to win its first team title since 2008			2
team principal @entity109 chose only to focus on @entity5 's comeback wednesday , saying : " i sense he is very happy to be returning to @entity25 and very determined to tackle the work that awaits him in the best way possible			1
" @entity2 's late founder @entity115 had a reputation for encouraging rivalry between his drivers but @entity2 has preferred to adopt a policy of focusing on a lead driver since @entity121 joined in 1996			1
silent but deadly @entity5 is as renowned for his reticence as he is for his pure speed -- the 33 - year - old simply prefers to do his talking on the track			0
but his occasional , pithy one - liners have earned him a legion of global fans			0
his comment to @entity90 on team radio as he raced to victory in @entity132 last year ( " leave me alone , i know what i 'm doing " ) was so popular it has appeared as a slogan on t - shirts and mugs			0
back in 2001 , @entity5 was fast tracked into @entity4 by @entity73 after competing in a mere 23 races in motorsport 's junior categories			0
@entity57 was the next team to recognize @entity5 's natural talent , and snapped him up on a long - term deal in 2002			1
the following season , @entity5 took @entity121 down to the final race of the season in a thrilling championship but he would have to wait for the @entity145 to retire before finally getting his hands on an elusive world title			1
@entity2 chose @entity5 as @entity121 's replacement in 2007 , hiring him for a reported $ 41 million			1
he soon earned his corn , bringing the drivers ' title back to @entity2 after seeing off @entity59 by a single point			0
@entity2 has now returned to @entity5 for a quick fix as the @entity2 desperately seeks to rein in the all - conquering @entity14 team			2
@entity5 , who turns 34 in october , will not be able to offer a long - term solution -- but @entity2 chiefs are gambling on the fact that given the right car he will deliver , and deliver quickly .			2

@entity5 has rejoined @entity2 to partner @entity6 in 2014
the @entity19 won the 2007 @entity162 title with @entity2 after replacing @entity121
@entity2 terminated @entity5 's contract in 2009 to make way for @entity6
@entity9 leaves the @entity8 team after eight years
