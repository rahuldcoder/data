-- the @entity1 is n't quite so lonely these days			1
even though its members -- @entity3 , @entity4 , and @entity5 -- are often apart because they live on different coasts , they 're still united in the studio as well as a series of @entity11 wednesday videos -- seriously , how many artists drop a video for just about every song on the album anymore ? they also have a bevy of guest stars to keep them company on the tracks , in the clips , and in televised performances ( check out @entity23 covering @entity25 's part on " @entity26 " -- which is , as they say , ironic )			1
the band 's latest release , " the @entity28 , " out this week , features not only @entity31 ( " @entity30 , " with @entity32 and @entity33 weighing in on the video ) and @entity34 ( " hugs " ) , but also @entity36 and @entity37 ( " @entity38 " ) and @entity40 's @entity39 ( " @entity41 " )			1
and that 's not counting the guest stars who turned out for the video of " @entity28 , " in which @entity44 , @entity45 , and @entity46 gamely step up and make a gay marriage statement with their @entity1 lovers			1
and yet , the guys still lament not being able to fit more friends in			1
but as @entity3 said , laughing , " there 's only so many spots on one fake rap album ! " and there was one icon he really wanted			1
" @entity57 would be the s * * t , " he enthused			1
" i saw her at the @entity62 , and she was awesome			2
she 's on the wish list			2
" the group 's previous albums , " @entity69 " and " @entity70 , " were enriched by access to " @entity67 " guest stars			1
these days , scheduling is a bit trickier			2
" when we made albums in the past , " @entity3 said , " it was n't always because someone was on the show when we asked them , but in their minds , they were like , ' there 's a chance this is for the show			1
' people came to ' @entity67 , ' and we plugged them into songs			2
" " they just walked into our office , " @entity5 said , " and it was easier to get everything done			2
now we may get a yes just as fast , but there 's logistics to consider : ' ok , but where are you ? ' " so for the new album , some participants were recorded in @entity95 ( such as @entity25 and @entity96 , who guests on " @entity98 " with @entity99 ) , some in @entity101 ( @entity34 and @entity102 , who guests on " the @entity105 " ) , and some on @entity106			1
@entity36 , who was in the middle of doing press for a film , accommodated the guys during his promotional junket			2
" we rented a room adjacent to the hotel room he was doing it in , and we had an engineer there , and i was on @entity106 , " @entity3 said			1
" he just walked in , and i watched him record for a good 45 minutes to an hour			2
he did a bunch of great takes , and then he asked if there was anything else i needed -- and there was not			2
it was @entity126 meets @entity127			2
" how comfortable the guests get with being raunchy or silly also plays a part in the recording , @entity5 said			0
" we 're very conscious of the different personalities , if someone does n't want to curse as much , or if someone does n't want to play with their image too much , " he said			0
" @entity36 was very comfortable , but sometimes people will be like , ' yeah , i 'm not that comfortable			0
' it helps to be given parameters			0
" sometimes a guest 's point of view may shift a bit			0
@entity144 , for instance , at first asked the group to give him something " even crazier " than what they originally came up with for " @entity149			0
" then he passed on that version , deciding it had become " too filthy			0
" but later , he added his own f - words to a separate digital short			0
" we were like , ' dude ! @entity155 ! ' " @entity4 said			0
" and now there 's a @entity144 character that only exists in the world of our videos , " @entity3 said			1
to make it easier on some guests , @entity3 will sing a temp vocal track , doing both the highs and the lows , " so they can hear an almost finished version , " @entity3 said			1
" then , somebody like @entity25 , she did her own countermelodies , " @entity4 added			0
" they come in with harmonies , and the talent , " @entity3 said			1
with rappers , however , the @entity1 guys are less likely to write a verse until they know who will be doing the part , and even then , they invite them to rewrite it			1
" for rappers , " @entity5 said , " we 'll leave open which bars of music they 're going to do , and give them bullet points of joke ideas that they can put into their own words			0
we want the rapper to feel like himself , and not like he 's doing someone else 's lyric			0
" " it has to be in their voice , " @entity3 said			1
" the style is so specific			0
" soon the guys will start to juggle their nonmusical projects with the idea of a @entity1 tour			1
@entity4 , who co-wrote and directed the film " @entity200 , " will be locking himself in a room with @entity202 and writing partner @entity203 to get to work on a script for " @entity200			0
" and @entity3 will soon be decamping to @entity101 to start shooting his new television comedy , " @entity206			1
" " other than ' girls ' and ' @entity208 , ' " he noted , " i defy you to name a show set in @entity95 that does n't shoot in @entity101 ! i wish we could have shot it in @entity213 -- i still love @entity95			0
but the irony of television production knoweth no bounds			0
" speaking of " girls , " will @entity4 -- who played @entity218 's lover @entity217 -- be back for another round , since the @entity222 comedy is shooting its third season this summer in @entity213 ? " @entity227 , if you talk to @entity225 ( @entity226 ) , tell her i 'm totally down ! " @entity4 pleaded			0
" maybe they can squeeze me in			0
but i do n't know what more you can see of me on that show -- except for the front part , and nobody wants to see that			0
