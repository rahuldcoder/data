@entity1 hopes to add to her 10 @entity3 medals in @entity8			1

it was a different story in @entity20 , however , after @entity1 had entered the record books with victories in the 500 meters pairs and the 500 meters fours			2
" no more competition , " she had said as she climbed out of the canoe after becoming the first woman in @entity3 history to win gold 20 years apart and the fifth competitor to collect winner 's medals at five separate games			1
" sometimes you just have to finish and it 's great to finish on a high			0
" but perhaps @entity1 felt she is still owed a games			0
as an 18 - year - old in @entity4 in 1980 , @entity1 claimed gold in the individual event			2
