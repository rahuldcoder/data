-- on a small , floating piece of ice in the @entity6 , several hundred miles north of @entity1 , a group of scientists are documenting what some dub an " @entity10 meltdown			1
" according to climate scientists , the warming of the region is shrinking the polar ice cap at an alarming rate , reducing the permafrost layer and wreaking havoc on polar bears , arctic foxes and other indigenous wildlife in the region			2
what is bad for the animals , though , has been good for commerce			0
the recession of the sea ice and the reduction in permafrost -- combined with advances in technology -- have allowed access to oil , mineral and natural gas deposits that were previously trapped in the ice			1
the abundance of these valuable resources and the opportunity to exploit them has created a gold rush - like scramble in the high north , with fierce competition to determine which countries have the right to access the riches of the @entity10			1
this competition has brought in its wake a host of naval and military activities that the @entity10 has n't seen since the end of the @entity51			1
now , one of the coldest places on @entity59 is heating up as nuclear submarines , @entity53 - class frigates , strategic bombers and a new generation of icebreakers are resuming operations there			0
just how much oil and natural gas is under the @entity10 ice ? the @entity10 is home to approximately 90 billion barrels of undiscovered but recoverable oil , according to a 2008 study by the @entity68			1
and preliminary estimates are that one - third of the world 's natural gas may be harbored in the @entity10 ice			1
but that 's not all that 's up for grabs			0
the @entity10 also contains rich mineral deposits			1
@entity77 , which was not historically a diamond - producing nation , is now the third - largest diamond producer in the world			0
if the global warming trend continues as many scientists project it to , it is likely that more and more resources will be discovered as the ice melts further			2
who are the countries competing for resources ? the @entity90 , @entity77 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 , @entity94 , @entity95 and @entity96 all stake a claim to a portion of the @entity10			1
these countries make up the @entity100 , a diplomatic forum designed to mediate disputes on @entity10 issues @entity104 , a professor at the @entity105 and an @entity10 expert , says " cooperation in the @entity10 has never been higher			1
" but like the oil trapped on the @entity10 sea floor , much of the activity of the @entity100 is happening below the surface			1
in secret diplomatic cables published by @entity116 , @entity93 foreign minister per @entity114 was quoted as saying to the @entity90 , " if you stay out , the rest of us will have more to carve up the @entity10			1
" at the root of @entity114 's statement is a dispute over control of territories that is pitting friend against foe and against friend			0
@entity77 and the @entity90 , strategic allies in @entity127 and @entity128 , are in a diplomatic dispute over the @entity130			0
@entity77 and @entity91 have recently signed development agreements together			0
in the same way a compass goes awry approaching the @entity135 , traditional strategic alliances are impacted at the top of the world			0
who owns the rights to the resources ? right now , the most far - reaching legal document is the @entity142 on @entity143 , or @entity143			2
all of the @entity10 states are using its language to assert their claims			2
the @entity143 was initially designed to govern issues like fishing rights , granting nations an exclusive economic zone 200 miles off their coasts			0
but in the undefined , changing and overlapping territory of the @entity10 , the @entity143 becomes an imperfect guide , and there are disputes over who owns what			1
one example is the @entity161 , which @entity77 , @entity93 and @entity91 all claim is within their territory , based on their cartographic interpretations			0
also complicating matters is the fact that the @entity90 has never ratified the @entity143			0
that has given other @entity100 nations more muscle to assert territorial rights			2
so what 's next ? with murky international agreements and an absence of clear legal authority , countries are preaching cooperation but preparing for conflict			0
there has been a flurry of new military activity reminiscent of days past			0
two @entity90 nuclear - powered attack submarines , the @entity184 and the @entity185 , recently finished conducting ice exercises in the @entity10			2
secretary of the navy @entity187 said the purpose of the recent naval exercises was " to do operational and war - fighting capabilities			0
places are becoming open that have been ice - bound for literally millennia			0
you 're going to see more and more of the world 's attention pointed towards the @entity10			2
" other @entity10 nations are ramping up their military capabilities as well			1
just this month , @entity91 announced that it is deploying two brigades to the @entity10 , including a special forces unit			2
the @entity91 air force has recently resumed strategic bomber flights over the @entity135			0
@entity77 , @entity93 and @entity92 are also rapidly rebuilding their military presence			0
but despite the buildup , almost all of the activity in the @entity10 has been within the scope of normal military operations or research			1
have we seen this before ? there is a long precedent for countries using the @entity10 to demonstrate military primacy			1
on april 25 , 1958 , the world 's first nuclear - powered submarine -- the @entity219 ( @entity184 571 ) -- began @entity220 , the first undersea transpolar crossing			0
done on the heels of the @entity225 satellite launch , it was a demonstration that the @entity90 could go places that its @entity51 nemesis could not			2
for the next three decades , @entity90 and @entity229 submarines would continue to use the @entity10 as a proving ground for military prowess			1
with the end of the @entity51 , that activity waned			2
but in 2007 , a @entity91 expedition planted a flag on the bottom of the polar sea floor , almost 14,000 feet below the surface			0
this " @entity245 " has brought renewed interest to the @entity10 and launched a flurry of activity -- scientific , economic and military -- that is eerily parallel to the decades of tension between the superpowers			1
the @entity51 may be over , but the dethawing of military activity means that the frigid @entity10 is once again becoming a hot spot .			1

tension is building in the @entity10 , where countries are vying for valuable natural resources
more oil , natural gas and mineral deposits can be accessed now because of climate change
there have been territorial disputes over the *underwater* land where these deposits rest
the @entity10 is now seeing naval and military activities it has n't seen since the @entity51
