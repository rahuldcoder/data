-- what was a somber mood following convicted cop killer @entity3 ' execution wednesday night turned to disgust and outrage by morning			1
@entity5 was a trending topic thursday because so many people had taken to @entity7 to express their dismay over @entity9 being deemed innocent in the death of her daughter while @entity3 is executed			1
" @entity5 is offered a book deal , @entity3 is only offered his last meal			2
@entity20 , our justice system is screwed , " came a tweet from the handle @entity17			0
another , from @entity22 , read , " if the @entity3 situation has taught us anything today , its that @entity5 should 've been black			2
" a jury found @entity9 not guilty of murder in july , whereas a jury and several judges on appeal have determined that @entity3 killed @entity30 , @entity31 , police officer @entity32 in 1989			2
@entity33 , @entity3 ' prosecutor , has said the case withstood every legal challenge but could n't win the battle of public opinion			2
race has been a major factor in people 's perception of the case , with many claiming @entity3 was railroaded because he was black			1
it also has raised questions about the fairness of the death penalty and whether it is more often applied to african - americans than whites			1
while assertions that the @entity51 executes more blacks than whites are incorrect -- the country has executed 263 more white people than black people since the death penalty 's 1976 reinstatement -- inequalities exist when a murder is interracial			1
according to the @entity60 , 15 white defendants have been executed for the murder of black victims , but 246 african - americans have been executed for killing whites			0
it 's just one of many factors that have @entity3 supporters and death penalty opponents -- often one and the same -- demanding that capital punishment be re-examined in this country			1
former president @entity69 , who along with archbishop @entity70 and pope @entity71 was among the most influential voices calling for clemency , said as much in his statement after @entity3 ' lethal injection			1
" if one of our fellow citizens can be executed with so much doubt surrounding his guilt , then the death penalty system in our country is unjust and outdated			1
we hope this tragedy will spur us as a nation toward the total rejection of capital punishment , " @entity69 wrote			1
certainly , the death penalty is an issue for which @entity51 support has flagged and spiked in the decades since the @entity51 @entity90 reinstituted it , but @entity51 have largely supported it since the 1930s , according to @entity93			1
the only exception , according to the polling agency , is 1966 , when 47 % of @entity51 said they opposed it , compared with 42 % who backed it			2
since the country began performing executions again , critics have been heavily outnumbered , with opposition never topping 32 % , @entity93 says			0
support jumped to 80 % -- compared with 16 % against -- in 1994 , and a poll last year showed a 64 - 29 split , with 6 % expressing no opinion , @entity93 reported			0
some of those who favor executions as a criminal deterrent flocked to @entity0 to post their thoughts on @entity3 ' death			1
" justice served , " wrote dplandy , while @entity113 wrote , " but he was a good guy when he was n't pistol whipping people or shooting them in the face			0
" the latter is a reference to a jury also finding @entity3 guilty of two aggravated assault charges : that he shot a man outside a pool party in @entity30 before striking a homeless man with his pistol			2
it was the pistol - whipping that prompted @entity32 to respond to the @entity127 parking lot where he was killed			0
some @entity0 commenters defended the police work and prosecution that led to @entity3 ' conviction and execution			1
one , fitat50 , even said , " the reason some people care about him is because they are sheep			0
" added @entity137 , " how about you just read the facts concerning the case ... like that there were 34 witnesses against him			0
. some of whom knew him before the cold blooded murder then identified him			0
oh wait , you would never take the time to read the case you just want to jump on the ' he 's innocent bandwagon			0
' " but some death penalty supporters , like commenter marciavolk , said there was too much doubt to administer the ultimate punishment			1
the commenter further said that the death penalty is " administered arbitrarily " and that the " long - standing discrimination against minorities in the south ( yeah it 's still there ) " played a role in the decision to execute @entity3			1
" we will never know if @entity3 was or was not guilty of the crimes he was charged with and that alone should have prevented him from being executed , " marciavolk wrote			2
another commenter , jangar , took issue with the evidence in the case , which has been in question since seven of nine witnesses recanted or changed their original testimony from the 1991 trial			0
as @entity176 and others have pointed out , @entity3 ' supporters also have problems with the lack of physical evidence and the investigation 's failure to produce the .38 - caliber pistol used in the slaying			2
" as we have seen over the years eye - witness testimony a lot of times is unreliable , " jangar wrote			0
" people say they saw something , convince themselves they really did see something , and then determine they could have been mistaken ; but with physical evidence -- gun , body , video tape -- the evidence is there in front of you and can be tested for dna			0
" the divergence of sentiments regarding @entity3 ' death was apparent around the globe			1
while right - wing legal analyst and author @entity207 wrote a thursday article headlined " @entity210 is @entity211 , " the @entity206 slammed the @entity213 ' refusal to intervene			1
" there is too much doubt to proceed with an execution			0
no amount of deliberation will change the fact that the case against mr. @entity3 has too many holes , " president @entity217 wrote			1
the @entity224 , the @entity225 and @entity226 's junior minister for human rights joined @entity217 in denouncing the execution , with the @entity224 saying that @entity51 must abolish capital punishment " to protect human dignity			1
" in the @entity51 , protests were not limited to @entity231 , @entity31 , where the state has been electrocuting or lethally injecting death row inmates since 1983			1
in @entity236 , more than a dozen people were arrested outside the @entity237 during a protest organized by @entity239			0
@entity240 , 32 , a @entity241 from @entity242 , @entity243 , and doctorate candidate at @entity245 , said he joined the demonstrators there			0
he was busy writing his dissertation wednesday but said he knew he had to participate			0
he said he was appalled by the final outcome			0
" we can see how much further we have to go in a country where we have an @entity253 - @entity51 president ... but an @entity254 in @entity31 can be executed , " he said			2
in @entity257 , @entity255 , 31 , who had not been following the case , was taking photographs in the city when he ran across forlorn protesters in " i am @entity3 " t - shirts leaving a protest in @entity263 after the execution			2
" what struck me was the looks on their faces as they walked away , " the ireporter said			0
" they looked very frustrated and down			0
