every age has the heroes it deserves , as the saying goes			2
to judge from the success of the movie " @entity8 , " the hero of the current moment would be the trained killer			1
director @entity10 's movie has been highly praised and loudly criticized			2
each new round of critical and public controversy over its presentation of war , veterans and their families boosts its ticket sales higher			2
it is the highest grossing war movie ever made in the @entity19			1
why has this movie become " a cultural phenomenon , " as many term it ? the answer lies in its focus on the figure of the sniper , whose military role isolates what is universally most fraught about warfare -- the act of targeting and shooting a human being -- and yet who also stands for values that are particularly cherished by many @entity19			1
unlike a helicopter or airplane pilot or tank commander -- to cite icons of other times , other wars -- the sniper works alone			2
he often has a spotter and is in contact with his unit but needs no one else to operate his lethal weapon			0
it is all about the relationship of the eyes and the trigger finger			0
" @entity8 " is at its most ambiguous as an anti-war war film when @entity10 aligns our vision with @entity56 's ( played by @entity57 ) , involving us in the emotions and moral dilemmas that come with the kill , even as this highlights the sniper 's singular and heavy responsibility			1
opinion : ' @entity8 , ' a powerful anti-war film the sniper embodies the individualism that is sacred to a large swath of the @entity19 population			1
it is the sniper 's operational independence that allows his skills to be transferred to the civilian realm			0
whether in the woods , at the shooting range , or in combat , the action and the equipment are not dissimilar			0
in " @entity8 , " the hero 's gun is an extension of his personality , as much as he fights against it : not only through his mechanically enabled vision but also through the prominence of weapons in his private life			1
it is not surprising that in the movie @entity56 gravitates to the shooting range as a means of easing his transition to civilian life			2
war heroes can appear in various guises			2
there are those who save their comrades in the heat of battle , and those who win accolades for their mastery of the weapons and strategies most valued at that combat moment			0
think of @entity104 crack fighter pilot @entity106 , nicknamed the @entity107 , whose skill confirmed aerial warfare 's potential			0
the sniper 's ascent comes in part from his utility in @entity19 counterinsurgency campaigns such as those conducted in @entity117 and @entity118			1
drones , too , are part of this warfare in which high technology surveillance sometimes aids that most traditional of combat pursuits -- the manhunt			0
but the military sniper , long held in suspicion for his independence by @entity127 and other @entity19 military units , has an almost romantic appeal for those immersed in gun culture			1
opinion : @entity133 is wrong about ' @entity8 ' the @entity135 - style showdown staged in " @entity8 " between @entity56 and the crack enemy sniper @entity137 ( @entity138 ) is not only a nod to @entity10 's filmmaking history , but to a fundamental figure in @entity19 history : the lone gunman , on a crusade to make the world safe			1
the most effective snipers have psychological as well as physical distance from their targets , which is useful now that the line between military and civilian enemy targets has become increasingly blurred			0
in counterinsurgency warfare in urban settings , everyone is a potential carrier of grenades or bombs , and uniforms are almost meaningless			0
in such situations , taboos against killing traditional noncombatants , such as women and children , come to seem outmoded and foolhardy			0
now that the major @entity19 military interventions overseas have ended or are smaller in scale , the millions of veterans created just in the past decade will have fewer options			1
" @entity8 " is a current film in this way as well			1
it models a transition for the military professional from wartime to peacetime , with gun culture as its constant			0
this is , in part , the secret of its success in @entity19 : it is an anti-war film that is not anti-gun			1
@entity56 did not become a hero because he died ( he was shot to death at a shooting range in 2013 and a fellow veteran is on trial in the case ) , but because he knew how to kill so well			0
he is the perfect hero for a country that has made a cult of the art of precision shooting , whether in combat or at the local range or gun show , and a country that clings to the right to bear arms , no matter how many civilian casualties , @entity56 among them , accumulate .			0

@entity200 : " @entity8 " has become the *top* - grossing war movie in @entity19
she says @entity19 *admires* the lead character for his individualism and *affinity* for guns
