-- opposition fighters who attacked @entity4 villages near the @entity6 city of @entity7 , killing at least 190 civilians , committed " serious abuses " that may amount to crimes against humanity , rights group @entity1 said friday			1
the abuses occurred after an opposition offensive on august 4 in which the fighters overran government army positions and occupied more than 10 @entity4 villages , the rights group said			1
@entity18 : @entity6 rebel group 's dangerous tie to @entity21 witnesses and survivors described how opposition fighters " executed residents and opened fire on civilians , sometimes killing or attempting to kill entire families who were either in their homes unarmed or fleeing from the attack , and at other times killing adult male family members , and holding the female relatives and children hostage , " the @entity1 report said			1
more than 200 civilians -- the vast majority of them women and children -- are still being held hostage by two opposition groups that led the offensive , the rights group said , citing opposition sources			1
it named the groups as the @entity47 ( @entity47 ) , which is affiliated with @entity21 in @entity48 , and @entity49			2

@entity6 president @entity58 's family belongs to the minority @entity4 sect , which is associated with @entity62			2
his government has consistently blamed the country 's conflict on " terrorists " backed by foreign powers , while his own forces are accused of abuses , including the use of chemical weapons against civilians			2
the @entity73 , the main opposition alliance , said that it was " deeply concerned " about the @entity1 report and that it " once again disavowed " the two groups holding the hostages			1
" we unequivocally condemn all human rights violations committed by armed groups , including extra-judicial killings and kidnappings , " it said			0
the offensive documented in the @entity1 report " does not represent an effort by the true @entity6 opposition , but rather a shameful one - time attack by outlier extremist groups that thrive under the hand of the @entity58 regime , " it said			1
many @entity47 fighters are believed to be foreign jihadists rather than @entity6			0
' war crimes ' evidence the evidence collected by @entity1 " strongly suggests that the serious abuses carried out by the opposition groups on august 4 were not the actions of a group of rogue fighters , " but were coordinated actions showing premeditation and organization			1
@entity1 says it believes at least 20 distinct armed opposition groups were involved in the offensive , but it is not clear whether they were all present in the villages on august 4 , when most of the abuses are thought to have occurred			1
@entity6 's rebels : 20 things you need to know however , its report says five groups were " the key fundraisers , organizers , planners , and executors of the attacks " and " were clearly present from the outset of the operation			1
" it says it has evidence " linking all five to specific incidents that amount to war crimes			0
" besides @entity47 and @entity49 , they are listed by @entity1 as @entity126 , @entity127 and @entity128			0
" the evidence gathered by @entity1 strongly suggests that the killings , hostage taking , and other abuses committed by the opposition forces on august 4 rise to the level of crimes against humanity , " the report said			1
" the scale and organization of these crimes indicate that they were systematic as well as being planned as part of an attack on a civilian population			0
" bodies buried in mass graves to compile the report , titled " @entity149 , " @entity1 researchers visited five of the villages involved after august 18 , where they spoke to residents and relatives of those killed or missing in the fighting , as well as @entity6 army and militia members , emergency responders and opposition members			1
its researchers also studied photographs and video footage of the events to corroborate witness accounts , the group said			0
the team collected the names of 190 civilians who were killed , including 57 women and at least 18 children and 14 elderly men , the report states			2
" given that many residents remain missing , and opposition fighters buried many bodies in mass graves , the total number of dead is likely higher , " it said			2
@entity179 says @entity181 - funded weapons have begun to reach @entity6 rebels " @entity1 has documented that opposition forces executed or unlawfully killed at least 67 of these 190 civilians even though they were unarmed and trying to flee			1
" further investigation is needed to establish exactly how the other residents died , but the indications are that " most of these individuals were either intentionally or indiscriminately killed by opposition forces , " it said			0
the rights group calls on states with influence over the parties involved in the conflict to press them to bring a halt to attacks on civilians			1
it also urges them to stop selling or supplying arms and ammunition to these groups , " given compelling evidence that they have committed crimes against humanity , until they stop committing these crimes and perpetrators are fully and appropriately held to account			0
" complicated picture reports of abuses such as those alleged in the @entity1 report have complicated international efforts to support the opposition to @entity58 's government			1
in more than two years of conflict , the opposition has fragmented across a wide ideological and geographic spectrum , according to @entity220 , a research fellow at the @entity221			0
while some are nationalists are bent on liberating their country from a ruthless regime , others view the conflict as a springboard to a global jihad			0
the main support for @entity6 rebels has so far come from the @entity231 monarchies of @entity232 and @entity233			0
@entity235 aid has been limited largely to nonlethal assistance such as communications gear and medical equipment			0
in july , the @entity240 administration began supplying small arms and ammunition to the rebels			0
but @entity235 officials have struggled with how to back opposition groups without providing weapons to those linked to @entity47 militants , such as the @entity126 , a group considered the most effective @entity251 force on the battlefield , but one the @entity235 says has ties to @entity21			1
meanwhile , fighters from the @entity256 - based @entity62 militant group @entity255 are helping @entity6 government forces			2
a video posted to @entity259 this week that purports to show @entity255 fighters killing injured @entity6 has angered many in the region			0
@entity255 has not responded to the furor			0
it is not clear who the alleged victims are .			0
