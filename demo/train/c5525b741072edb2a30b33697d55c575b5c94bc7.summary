@entity0 , @entity1 -- a @entity5 passenger jet with more than 200 people on board flew through the trajectory of a @entity10 rocket that had been fired minutes earlier , the @entity1 government said			1
@entity10 fired the rocket tuesday at 4:17 p.m. without giving any navigational warning , @entity11 , a spokesman for the @entity12 , said wednesday			1
seven minutes later , a @entity16 plane carrying 220 passengers from @entity19 's narita airport to @entity20 in @entity5 passed through the rocket 's trajectory , he said			1
" it was a very dangerous situation , " @entity11 said during a news briefing			0
" @entity10 's provocative actions violate the international navigation laws and pose a great threat to the safety of civilians			2
" @entity1 has informed @entity5 authorities about what happened , the @entity29 said			1
a @entity5 foreign ministry spokesman , @entity32 , said thursday that the plane flew through @entity10 airspace " normally on that day without incident			1
" " when relevant countries conduct military training or exercises , they should abide by international custom to take measures that would ensure the safety of civil aircraft or ships passing through their airspace or territorial water , " @entity32 said			0
he said that @entity5 attaches a great deal of importance to the safety of its civil aircraft and would " seek verification from relevant parties and express necessary concern from our side			1
" officials from @entity16 did n't respond to calls seeking comment thursday			0
the rocket in question was one of seven fired tuesday by @entity10 into the sea off its east coast , according to @entity1 authorities			1
given the speeds the plane and rocket were traveling at , the seven - minute gap means there was still " quite a big distance " between them , said @entity72 , @entity73 managing editor at @entity74 , an aviation and aerospace website			2
" although the chances of hitting the aircraft were extremely low , akin to hitting a bullet with a bullet , there is absolutely no need to endanger civilians , however remote the danger may be , " he said			1
@entity10 missile capabilities @entity10 defends launches @entity10 on wednesday defended the series of short - range missile and rocket launches it has carried out in recent weeks			1
" it is justifiable self - defense behavior for us to conduct these military exercises in order to preserve peace in the region and to protect the safety of our people and our country , " the @entity10 's @entity91 said in a statement carried by state media			2
the military 's statement did n't make any mention of @entity1 's comments about the @entity5 plane , but it said its recent launches had n't affected " international navigational order			1
" the @entity10 's launches have taken place as @entity113 and @entity1 troops conduct annual military exercises in the region			1
the large - scale drills anger @entity10 , which says it views them as a rehearsal for an invasion			2
the @entity120 has fired missiles or rockets into the sea on several occasions between february 21 and tuesday , according to the @entity1 government			2
@entity0 says some of the ballistic missiles are @entity128 class with a long enough range to cover the entire @entity130			0
@entity10 on wednesday acknowledged that it had conducted " rocket launch training " over that period			1
@entity10 shows off @entity1 man it 's holding on spy charges who 's provoking whom ? @entity1 has said the launches -- short - range and aimed in a northeasterly direction out to sea -- are intentional provocations			1
the @entity142 said monday that launches of the @entity128 violate @entity145 resolutions			0
" we urge @entity10 to refrain from provocative actions that aggravate tensions , and instead focus on fulfilling its international obligations and commitments , " @entity142 spokeswoman @entity146 said			2
those comments appeared to have irritated @entity10 's military			2
" the @entity113 and its supporters are calling our actions provocation , but they should not talk about provocation when they do n't know what provocation is , " the @entity10 's military statement said			2
" provocation is when somebody has intent to hurt somebody else , but what we are doing is to protect ourselves , our country , our land , our people			0
" the @entity113 - @entity1 military exercises , on the other hand , are provocative , @entity10 said : " it 's a reckless @entity113 way of provocation and they 're doing all this on somebody else 's land			1
" it threatened the possibility of the launch of a more powerful rocket			0
@entity179 had previously called for the cancellation of the joint exercises , a request dismissed by @entity183 and @entity0			0
@entity10 launches missiles into sea calmer than last year the @entity120 's verbal attack wednesday did n't reach the ominous levels of its saber rattling this time last year , which included threats of preemptive nuclear strikes against the @entity113 and @entity1			1
" unannounced missile tests are not a good thing , but their political and military significance depends on context , " @entity193 , a visiting fellow at the @entity194 , wrote in a blog post tuesday			0
@entity10 conducted or threatened test launches during a similar period last year , soon after it had drawn international condemnation for launching a long - range rocket and carrying out its third nuclear test			1
" this year , the political setting is less confrontational , " wrote @entity193 , who is also a professor at the @entity204 and @entity205 at the @entity206			0
despite the current military drills , ties between @entity10 and @entity1 have improved slightly in recent months			1
over several days last month , the two countries held reunions of families separated for decades by the @entity213 -- the first such meetings since 2010			0
@entity1 on wednesday said it was proposing new talks between the two sides next week to discuss the possibility of further reunions			0
but @entity10 rejected the proposal , the @entity219 said thursday			0
compared with last year , @entity10 is being " remarkably quiet , " said @entity221 , a professor of history at @entity223 in @entity0			0
" they had to do something because it would be politically impossible to do nothing during the joint exercises , especially after they made so much noise about it , " @entity221 said			0
" but they act with remarkable restraint			0
" report : @entity10 fires two missiles off eastern coast @entity2 's @entity235 reported from @entity0 , and @entity236 reported and wrote from @entity237			0
