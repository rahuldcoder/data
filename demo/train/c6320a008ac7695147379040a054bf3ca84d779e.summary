health officials have been warning us about antibiotic overuse and drug - resistant " superbugs " for a long time			1
but today the @entity4 is sounding the alarm in a new way			2
for the first time , the @entity4 is categorizing drug - resistant superbugs by threat level			1
that 's because , in their conservative estimates , more than 2 million people get antibiotic - resistant infections each year , and at least 23,000 die because current drugs no longer stop their infections			1
antibiotics are designed to kill bacteria that cause infection			0
however , in the process they can also kill so - called good bacteria ( the human body hosts about 100 trillion )			2
the @entity24 @entity23 explains it this way : " every time a person takes antibiotics , sensitive bacteria are killed , but resistant germs may be left to grow and multiply			2
repeated and improper uses of antibiotics are primary causes of the increase in drug - resistant bacteria			1
" some bad bacteria are naturally resistant to certain types of antibiotics , according to @entity38			0
others can become resistant by spontaneous genetic mutation or by swapping genes with other bugs			0
so the @entity4 is ranking the worst drug - resistant bacteria according to how many people get sick , the number of hospitalizations and the number of deaths caused by each			1
they also took into account how many , if any , existing antibiotics still work on the bacteria			0
instead of red , orange or yellow -- the levels once used to describe terrorism threats -- the @entity4 is using " urgent , " " serious " and " concerning			0
" fatal brain disease may have infected 13 knowing the specific names of the deadly bacteria may not be essential for the average person , but @entity4 director dr. @entity61 said monday that the @entity4 is warning the public about these health threats before they get out of control			2
" for the first time , " said @entity61 , " we have a snapshot of antimicrobial threats that have the most impact on human health			0
" according to the @entity4 , the following bacteria are the most " @entity72 " : @entity74 bacteria -- a family of germs called carbapenem - resistant @entity77 , which includes @entity80			1
some @entity74 bacteria are resistant to all existing antibiotics			1
the @entity4 reports more than 9,000 infections are contracted in hospitals and other health care settings from these bacteria			1
as many as 50 % of the patients who are infected with @entity74 end up dying because there is nothing to help them fight the infections			2
@entity92 ( @entity92 for short ) -- a bacteria that can cause life - threatening diarrhea			1
it kills up to 14,000 people and causes a quarter million hospitalizations each year			1
most patients who get this potentially deadly infection are on antibiotics for other infections			0
the problem is that while antibiotics kill bad bugs , they also kill good bacteria in your gastrointestinal system that help fight off bad bacteria , @entity92 included			2
fecal transplant cures woman 's bacterial infection neisseria gonorrhoeae -- the drug - resistant form of this bacteria causes gonorrhea , the second most commonly reported infection in the @entity119			1
gonorrhea can cause a variety of illnesses in men and women , including infertility			0
the @entity4 estimates there are 820,000 infections each year			1
in nearly a third of the cases , treatment of the sexually - transmitted disease , is hampered by growing antibiotic resistance			0
sexually - transmitted superbug could be major crisis @entity61 said if the current trends continue , " the medicine cabinet may be empty for patients who need them in the coming months and years			0
" to avoid what @entity61 calls a " post-antibiotic " era , where none of the existing drugs work anymore and new ones have n't been approved , the @entity4 has created a four - step plan to stem the tide of antibiotic resistance			2
the government agency hopes to better track infections in the future to know when a bacteria is becoming drug - resistant			1
by spotting the trend earlier , scientists may be able to develop new antibiotics quicker			0
you can also do your part , the @entity4 said , by preventing infections in the first place			2
preventing infection starts with practicing good hand hygiene and safe food - handling , so you do n't get sick in the first place			0
since many antibiotic - resistant infections are spread in hospital settings , patients and their families should feel empowered to ask doctors and other health care personnel coming into their rooms if they have washed their hands			1
patients should also only take antibiotics when they are really necessary			0
changing the way antibiotics are used is perhaps " the single most important action needed to greatly slow the development and spread of antibiotic - resistant infections , " @entity61 said			1
patients need to demand fewer antibiotics and doctors have to resist patients requests for them when they know they wo n't work			0
also , lowering the use of antibiotics in animals to only when it 's absolutely necessary can contribute to stretching the life and usefulness of available drugs , @entity61 said			0
disinfectants could give rise to superbugs			0

more than 2 million people get antibiotic - resistant infections each year
@entity4 is ranking the worst bacteria based on number of hospitalizations and deaths
drug - resistant ' superbugs ' include @entity74 bacteria , @entity92 and @entity202
