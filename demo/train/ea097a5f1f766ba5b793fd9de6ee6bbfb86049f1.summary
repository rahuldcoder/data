-- it can happen to anybody -- forgetting your glasses are on the top of your head , or not remembering a loved one 's birthday after celebrating it for decades			0
most of us simply laugh off these short memory lapses			1
but for a former professional football player , memory lapses can be a scary thing			1
they can be a sign of chronic traumatic encephalopathy , or @entity19 , a disease that has been found in the brains of many athletes who suffered repeated hits to the head during their career			1
quarterback @entity26 played 321 straight games in the @entity28 before retiring			1
he recently told sports talk 570 in @entity30 that he ca n't remember his daughter participating in youth soccer one summer , even though she played several games			0
that , and other memory lapses , have worried him			1
" for the first time in 44 years , that put a little fear in me , " he said			0
" @entity39 only knows the toll			0
" @entity26 discusses impact concussions have had on his life the only way to diagnose @entity19 is after death -- by analyzing brain tissue and finding microscopic clumps of an abnormal protein called tau			1
@entity49 has been found in the brains of dozens of former @entity28 players , including @entity52 , @entity53 , @entity54 and @entity55 , who all committed suicide			1
it was also found in the brain of @entity59 , who died in 2002			2
scientists are working to identify some common symptoms of the brain disease in living players			1
experts say athletes with @entity19 often struggle with memory and decision - making			1
some exhibit mood and behavior problems such as depression and hopelessness , or violent , explosive behavior			0
a few show no symptoms at all			0
" there is no specific order of changes in @entity19 ; it 's on a case - by - case basis , " @entity76 , co-founder of the @entity77 , told @entity0			2
" it could be that some people have more initial changes to ( brain ) areas that are more responsible for mood and aggression and impulse control			0
" in august , thousands of former football players and their families reached a settlement with the @entity28 in a lawsuit that put concussions , and their impact on the brain , under the microscope			1
the deal called for the @entity28 to pay $ 765 million to fund medical exams , concussion - related compensation , medical research for retired @entity28 players and their families , and litigation expenses , according to a court document filed in @entity105 in @entity106			1
" my hope is that any players or ex-players that are suffering , or begin to suffer , from symptoms of dementia , will be taken care of in a respectable manner through this settlement , " said @entity107 , one of the plaintiffs , whose husband @entity55 committed suicide in 2009 at age 38			2
scientists found evidence of @entity19 in @entity55 's brain after his death			1
at the heart of the lawsuit was plaintiffs ' allegations that the @entity28 led a deliberate misinformation campaign -- primarily through its @entity130 -- to deny scientific data being presented in the medical community about concussion risks			2
the suit alleged that misinformation , which included studies by the committee suggesting no correlation between concussions and long - term brain damage , trickled down to players so that they did not realize the true risks they were taking while playing			2
the @entity28 did n't comment about the settlement , but a league spokesman previously said , " any allegation that the league sought to mislead players has no merit ... and stands in contrast to actions it took to better protect players			1
" in recent years , the @entity28 has attempted to strengthen rules that govern player conduct on the field and added sideline medical staff -- unaffiliated with the teams -- in an effort to evaluate more independently injured players			1
what is most important , said @entity161 , a former player and plaintiff , " is to bring attention to the plight of thousands of players and the importance of taking concussion and head trauma seriously			2
" concussions result from blows to the head , such as when a player collides with another			0
" in a football game , when someone takes a hard hit , the helmet does a pretty good job of protecting the skull from getting a skull fracture , " dr. @entity173 , a neurosurgeon and @entity0 's chief medical correspondent , told @entity175			0
" but what is really happening when someone is running down the field and ... they get hit -- the brain keeps moving inside the skull			0
" it 's not so much the hit , although that 's important , but the sudden acceleration and deceleration of the brain that causes the concussion , @entity173 said			0
confusion , nausea , headache and loss of consciousness are some of the immediate symptoms of concussions , but they can also have longer - lasting effects			0
severe impacts to the head can lead to bleeding or permanent nerve damage			0
research suggests repeated concussions can lead to @entity19			2
