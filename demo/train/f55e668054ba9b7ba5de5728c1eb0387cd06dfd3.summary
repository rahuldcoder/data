-- some of the world 's top tennis stars will have the honor of carrying their countries ' flags at friday 's opening ceremony for the @entity7 , but one of the sport 's biggest names is taking a back seat			1
not due to injury , like @entity13 singles champion @entity14 -- who has had to relinquish his role as @entity17 's flag bearer -- but because one of the game 's renowned gentlemen thinks it 's time to share the prestigious job			1
while former world no. 1s @entity25 and @entity27 will lead the way for @entity29 and @entity30 , @entity24 's team will be led into the @entity31 by a gold medalist , and one of the @entity36 nation 's finest tennis players -- though he 's not the one that you 'd expect to see in the limelight			1
@entity41 has spent his career in the shadow of @entity44 , but on friday the eyes of the world will be on the man known as " @entity41 " -- and not his great friend			1
@entity30 @entity50 first for @entity27 @entity51 , the most successful men 's tennis player of any era , declined the chance to carry the @entity24 flag for the third time			1
" i just felt it was important to give someone else a chance			0
in @entity24 we believe that , " the 30 - year - old said			1
" i told the @entity62 that they should choose someone else and they chose my partner , @entity41			1
it 's a great , great honor for him			2
i could n't have won the gold without him , everybody knows that			1
i think they chose the right guy			0
" a tale of two careers @entity41 has won three tournament titles to @entity44 's 75 , and $ 5.5 million in prize money to the 16 - time grand slam champion 's $ 73 million , but they have one thing in common : an olympic gold medal			1
four years ago in @entity78 , seeded only fourth , the @entity24 duo overcame the odds to win the men 's doubles competition -- cementing a partnership that began when they started practicing together in the late 1990s			1
@entity41 , nearly four years @entity44 's junior , was just 16 at the time			1
" he was already number six in the world -- after 10 minutes i was completely red ! " @entity41 told @entity0 's @entity89 of his first session with @entity44			1
" i was dead tired , and so nervous to play with him			0
" he 's the best , it 's good for any player			2
we 'll be practicing one week and then playing each other the next , but it 's not the fact that we share nationalities that makes playing him hard , it 's that he 's the best in the world			2
" american idol @entity41 , like @entity44 , idolized seven - time @entity105 winner @entity104 when he was growing up			1
" i was n't good until i was 17 -- i never even won the @entity109 , " the 2003 @entity108 boys ' champion said			2
" @entity104 was a great athlete and i was a big fan			0
that 's why i focus on being an allrounder			0
" @entity44 matched @entity104 ' record tally at the @entity113 when he beat @entity114 in this month 's final , and @entity41 will face @entity116 's world no. 4 in the opening round of the @entity50 singles competition			1
despite slipping down the world rankings from a career high of ninth in 2009 to 25th ahead of @entity7 , @entity41 still holds hopes of success			1
" i feel i 'm playing the best tennis of my career right now -- the top 40 is just so strong , the strongest it 's ever been , maybe			1
with this top 40 you have to fight for every match			0
to break back into it is more mental than physical , for sure			0
it 's about confidence , " he said " sometimes i put too much pressure on myself			0
i 'm too tight , because i want to win			0
that 's why i need to focus on what 's going on on the court , not off of it			0
" family ties his drop in form coincided with the birth of his first child , daughter @entity144 , in 2010 , while last year he separated from his wife @entity146			0
" having a daughter and being a tennis pro changes everything			0
it 's hard to train so much , but it 's great to see she 's interested in what i 'm doing -- if i 'm playing tennis , she wants to play tennis , " he said			1
@entity41 fondly recalls @entity78 , where he and @entity44 beat top - ranked doubles duo @entity158 and @entity159 in the semifinals before winning gold			1
" we played our best tennis against the @entity164 -- it was the toughest and most important win			0
whilst we talked strategy for the finals afterwards , it was made easier knowing we were playing great tennis , " he said			0
" in the first game i was n't playing well , but @entity44 really helped me to be comfortable			2
we 've known each other for so long , but even we were surprised at how easy we found it on the court			0
it was so natural , and talking helped a lot -- we 're very honest around the court			0
" their close relationship translated well off the court too , particularly in the @entity179			0
" at night all of the @entity24 athletes would play cards			2
we played a lot against the soccer team -- we were the best though , you can ask them ! " @entity188 for life if @entity51 's inclusion for @entity192 was a foregone conclusion , @entity41 's presence was anything but guaranteed			1
" @entity44 had a lot of great players to choose from ( as a partner )			2
it was a tough choice but in the end he chose me			0
we were having a great time and i think that 's part of the reason we won -- i was happy for him and he was happy for me , " he said			2
" i was almost crying at the medal ceremony			0
we had to joke around to stop the tears and start laughing instead			0
we used our friendship to stop from crying in front of everybody ! " it was the best moment of my career because it was n't just about tennis			2
it was about sport , it was about @entity24 , it 's a dream for everyone and to share it with someone added to the enjoyment			1
" @entity51 will go into @entity7 seeking the one major title that eludes him -- @entity50 gold in the singles			1
he begins his campaign against @entity224 's @entity223 , the man who took him to five sets at @entity105 in 2010			0
@entity51 reached the semifinals as a teenager at @entity228 but lost in the playoff for the bronze , then crashed out in the second round in @entity232 and the last eight in @entity78			2
" the day before the ( doubles ) quarterfinals @entity44 lost to @entity236 in the singles and i had to prove to him that he could trust me , " @entity41 said			1
" once we started playing well i could tell he got over the loss and said to himself , ' okay , let 's do something in the doubles now			2
' that was the moment , and now we have a gold medal -- together , for life			0

@entity41 will carry @entity24 's @entity50 flag for @entity7
fellow gold medalist @entity44 declined role for opening ceremony
they won gold together as a doubles pairing at @entity13 in 2008
@entity41 has spent most of his tennis career in shadow of his friend @entity51
