-- we are in the middle of a fight to preserve the dignity and grace that makes all of us @entity6			1
we have big hearts and great souls			2
i have seen them , felt them and watched them in wonder when my family was lost and unreachable in the wake of @entity17			2
i cried , worrying for those i loved , heartbroken by what happened to our beloved @entity20			2
and in the middle of that tough moment , the decency of people shone through in e-mails , phone calls and in person			1
everybody was saying the same thing : " how can i help ? " this is what we do in times of struggle			2
we offer our hand and our love to pull someone up who 's been knocked down by hard times and despair			2
it 's just a fundamental rule in life and in any fight ; you do n't kick people when they 're down			1
but for some reason , this principle has been lost on the 217 members of the @entity49 who decided to lace up some combat boots with rough , crushing soles to kick and kick again the 48 million @entity6 who count on food stamps			1
i am not going to mince words			2
when the @entity49 voted to cut $ 40 billion to the food stamp program over the next 10 years , that was n't an example of government tightening its belt or making tough choices			1
that vote was n't a philosophy or an ideology about governing			2
pure and simple , it was a heartless act			2
it was kicking millions of our families , neighbors and friends when they are down			0
and the people who work for a living in this country are down			1
let 's take a walk through the facts of what 's happened to them during the @entity79 and this nonrecovery of the economy			0
the median family net worth dropped from $ 126,400 in 2007 to $ 77,300 in 2010 , according to the @entity83			0
median family income fell from $ 49,600 in 2007 to $ 45,800 in 2010			0
( these are the latest available figures )			0
" @entity83 ( @entity83 ) found that middle - class families had sustained the largest percentage losses in both wealth and income during the crisis , limiting their ability and willingness to spend , " according to the @entity94			0
for 30 years , wages have flat - lined or declined for most workers , particularly in the past 10 years , as low - paying jobs replace middle - income paying jobs			0
in 2009 , only half of the country had any assets , and those numbers have gotten worse during the last three years			1
and here 's the kicker			0
today -- based on wage levels -- half of @entity6 live in poverty or near poverty			1
the gap between the well - to - do and everybody else is widening alarmingly			0
probably everyone reading this knows someone who is striving mightily , working two jobs and cutting expenses to the bone while barely making ends meet			1
to be considered poor by federal standards , a family of four must make less than $ 23,550 a year			1
a person must make less than $ 11,490			0
for the unemployed and the millions who have been looking for work for six months or more , the struggle is many times harder and uglier			0
ask any worker at @entity128 , @entity129 , @entity130 or @entity131 , " how many jobs do you have ? " and likely he or she will tell you : " two			0
" i know colleagues who 've had breakfast at one store , and gone to lunch in another , only to find the same person waiting on them			0
one young woman i heard about gets up at 4 a.m. for her first job and ends her day at 10 p.m. at her second job			0
the average allotment of food stamps is $ 133 a person a month			1
let me tell you something i can pretty much bet my house on -- that woman is not using her food stamp card to buy lobsters and caviar			1
she 's quietly going to the food pantry , checking the sales in the grocery store , spending some time at the kitchen table clipping coupons and making a serious plan to turn that box of pasta , pound of beef , and if she 's lucky , some fresh fruits and vegetables , into a meal plan truly worthy of a @entity170 belt			1
is there fraud ? yes			0
is there some waste ? yes			0
but today , the food stamp program has an error rate of only 3 % -- and those errors were mostly committed by the government in underpayments as well as overpayments and payments to ineligible families			1
fraud is a piece of grain compared with the millions of families who manage to put food on the table because of this program			1
and those few bad apples who do commit fraud are no excuse to kick the unemployed and the poor when they are engaged in a mighty battle to get themselves and their families back on their feet			1
so shame on this @entity199 for fighting dirty during working people 's hour of struggle			1
polls show @entity6 have n't approved much of @entity199 lately			1
but there is a way to gain favor			0
if this @entity199 wants to make cuts , why not look at the @entity208 , notorious for waste ? or check out the @entity210 , which made about $ 28 million in inappropriate farm assistance payments , according to a compilation of government waste reported in @entity214			0
or perhaps lawmakers could start with themselves ? rep. @entity216 , @entity217 , tried to shame her colleagues into cutting less from the food stamp program ( called the @entity220 , or @entity220 )			1
speaking of representatives who would vote to take food from @entity6 's tables , she said , " some of these same members travel to foreign countries under the guise of official business			1
they dine at lavish restaurants , eating steak , vodka and even caviar			1
" @entity216 talked about 20 members of @entity199 who traveled to @entity234 and got a daily food allowance of $ 166			2
the average amount a family member gets on food stamps is less than $ 4 a day			1
and the @entity239 reported that rep. @entity240 , @entity241 , received $ 3,588 in taxpayer funds for both food and lodging during a six - day trip to @entity246			2
the @entity247 urged @entity240 to try the " @entity248 " and live on $ 4 a day			2
he could even try it in @entity246			0
yet our representatives , one after the other , mostly @entity252 , stepped onto the @entity49 floor to speak and vote in the name of saving money for the taxpayer			0
they went after the poor , the unemployed , the single mom , the single dad , the grandparents -- all those people who are trying to make it work			1
well , they did n't just do wrong ; they are wrong			0
i urge the @entity265 to restore every single dime to the food stamp program			2
i applaud the president for saying that he 'll veto these cuts			0
we 're lacing up our shoes , too , but we 're going to fight these merciless cuts with the golden rule			0
you know why ? " do unto others " trumps " kick ' em when they 're down " every time			0
the @entity6 people are decent and fair			1
it 's time to stand tall for this essential program for millions			0
it 's time and our might will make this right			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity287 .			1

@entity287 : @entity6 are *generous* and help people who are down on their luck
@entity287 : lawmakers will take food from poor @entity6 by cutting food stamps
half of @entity6 live in or near poverty , she says , and food stamps help stave off *hunger*
lawmakers should cut their own lavish expense accounts for steak and wine , she says
