-- the advance buildup has all been about @entity2 as he prepares to enter the church of @entity4 and seek absolution for his sins			1
but this much - anticipated television moment is as much a test for @entity9 as for the disgraced former cycling champion			1
for while @entity2 is no longer the hero of old , @entity4 is n't the same old @entity4 , either			1
the interview , to be conducted monday , wo n't take place on @entity4 's old blockbuster show , but on her little - watched cable channel			1
it 's part of a 90 - minute special airing thursday that could help @entity9 reclaim a bit of the limelight that faded when she gave up her throne as @entity21 's talk show queen to build her cable brand			1
it 's hardly surprising that @entity2 would choose the @entity4 route for dropping his decade of denials about doping			1
( i instantly knew that what was he would do			0
you do n't go on @entity4 after being stripped of your championships and repeat the same old excuses			1
@entity34 reports that @entity2 will admit to using banned substances after his camp had floated the idea in a leak to the @entity39			1
) watch : does @entity4 have the cultural clout to revive @entity2 's career ? after all , she has been the go - to gal for famous folks in trouble			1
@entity44 talked about drug use with @entity4			2
track star @entity46 talked with @entity4 about going to prison for lying about using banned substances			2
even author @entity49 , who touted on @entity4 an addiction memoir that turned out to have significant fabrications , went back on the show to submit to her castigation			2
when @entity4 was syndicated on @entity56 stations , her program was appointment viewing			2
how many people even know where the @entity59 is on their cable system ? @entity9 has acknowledged that she 's had a rough go in the cable world , which has included management turmoil , layoffs and the canceling of @entity68 's show			1
" i certainly did not expect the velocity of schadenfreude -- meaning people sort of lying in wait for you to fail , or make a mistake , " she has said			0
watch : was @entity75 and @entity77 's fight on @entity79 riveting or revolting ? what made @entity4 a powerful cultural force , beyond her ratings and big - name interviews and ability to sell books , was her prowess at image rehab			1
if @entity4 forgave you , could @entity21 be far behind ? so the stakes in the @entity2 encounter are considerable for her as well			1
but @entity2 is no ordinary celebrity who did something naughty that can be erased with a few well - timed tears			2
the man became an icon after battling back from cancer to reclaim his place as the world 's best bike racer			0
but then came the allegations from former teammates and others that @entity2 cheated , that he used performance - enhancing substances banned by racing authorities			2
watch : was @entity39 right in depicting @entity105 @entity104 as a boys ' club ? @entity2 denied these charges again and again			2
he lied to my colleague @entity109 , who produced a @entity112 cover story titled " @entity113 in @entity2			2
" and he lied to me in two interviews			0
he was fervent and passionate , not just in saying he had never used banned substances but in accusing @entity21 anti-doping officials of conducting a " personal vendetta " against him			0
that was then ; this week is @entity4			0
@entity2 's motivation is obvious			1
his career is in ruins			0
the @entity123 cancer charity he founded is struggling			0
he wants to compete again and needs somehow to put this phase of his career behind him			0
but that is not so easy for athletes who cheat , as we were reminded by last week 's vote to exclude @entity131 , @entity132 and @entity133 from baseball 's @entity134 , based almost exclusively on alleged use of performance - enhancing drugs			0
watch : why are media swooning over @entity140 cover star @entity139 ? they never apologized ; perhaps @entity2 intends to do so			0
but if millions of people are n't watching him on @entity4 -- if most of the country just sees a 20 - second clip later -- does it have the same effect ? @entity4 might forgive @entity2 , clearing the way for others to do the same			1
or she might scold him , fostering a sense that he was publicly shamed for his conduct			0
either way , @entity9 will , for the first time in a long while , occupy center stage once again			0
for @entity2 , though , the spotlight might prove less flattering			0
