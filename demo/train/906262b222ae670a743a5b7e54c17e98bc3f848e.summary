so , got any ideas for what to do with a used space telescope ? @entity4 hopes to find a new job for its planet - hunting kepler probe after efforts to restore precision control of the orbiting telescope have failed , the space agency announced thursday			1
@entity10 has been sidelined since mid-may , after the second of four devices used to aim the spacecraft 's telescope gave out			1
controllers have been trying to restart at least one of those two devices , known as reaction wheels , since july			0
" the wheels are sufficiently damaged that they can not sustain spacecraft pointing control for any extended period of time , " @entity19 , @entity10 's deputy project manager , told reporters thursday afternoon			1
that means @entity10 's original science mission -- the search for @entity30 - like planets far beyond our solar system -- is over , said @entity33 , the head of @entity4 's astrophysics division			1
but the space agency is trying to figure out whether it can find other missions that do n't require that kind of pinpoint control -- and if so , " whether that science is compelling enough to justify continued investment in @entity10 operations , " @entity35 said			1
the roughly $ 600 million mission has so far confirmed 135 planets and identified nearly 3,500 possible planets			1
it findings have led scientists to believe that most stars in our galaxy have planets circling them			2
two of them -- found about 1,200 light - years away -- are considered the best candidates so far for hosting life			2
controllers have remained in communication with the craft , which is more than 45 million miles from @entity30			0
and since scientists still have more than two years of data to comb through , @entity4 does n't consider the mission over , said @entity63 , the project 's principal scientist			1
" we have all this data we have not yet analyzed , and we expect many , many more discoveries , " he said			0
@entity10 needs three of its four reaction wheels to tweak the telescope , which is aimed at a sliver of the cosmos around the @entity74 constellations @entity75 and @entity76			1
the no. 2 reaction wheel failed in 2012 , while the no. 4 unit quit in may			0
in a series of tests that began in @entity82 , controllers got both reaction wheels to turn			0
in early august , they stopped tests on wheel no. 4 after finding high levels of friction , but continued testing the second until encountering the same problem last week , @entity19 said			0
@entity19 said the probe can still be aimed using the two remaining reaction wheels , and its thrusters -- just not as finely as it could by reaction wheels alone			0
the thrusters still have enough fuel remaining to last several years if used carefully , he said			0
the probe was launched in 2009 and has already surpassed its three - and - a - half - year minimum expected lifespan			2
@entity63 said @entity4 has asked scientists to propose alternatives within a few weeks			2
the agency will then decide " which of these will be practical and which of these we can do for a reasonable cost			0
