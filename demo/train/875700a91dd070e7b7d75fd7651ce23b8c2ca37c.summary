-- what a difference a slam makes as @entity3 again found to her cost friday at the @entity5			1
on the green grass of @entity8 the popular 23 - year - old @entity6 swept aside @entity9 on the way to the women 's singles final where she lost to @entity14			0
fast forward to the final major of the season on the hard courts of @entity18 and 16th seed @entity3 made a tame third round exit to @entity22 @entity21 , while @entity14 has retired and is reporting the tournament for a television company			1
@entity3 's career was place on hold after a nasty fall at the @entity29 which saw her depart the court in a wheelchair and with a severe injury to her ankle			2
after a lengthy rehabilitation , @entity3 has shown glimpses of the form that had her talked of as a successor to the likes of @entity41 , culminating in her dream run to the final at @entity8			0
early exits in two hard court tournaments in the build - up to the @entity5 were not ideal preparation , but @entity3 came through her opening two matches against @entity50 of @entity22 and @entity52 's @entity51 in straight sets			1
24th seed @entity21 proved a tougher test and was always in the ascendancy in a match lasting a shade over an hour and a half			2
she closed it out 6 - 4 7 - 5 after breaking @entity3 for the third time to move into the last 16 in fine style			0
it was another grand slam disappointment for @entity3 , who has never reached the fourth round at this level other than at @entity8			2
earlier , @entity68 's @entity67 revenged a 2012 defeat at the @entity5 when she beat @entity71 teenager @entity70 6 - 2 7 - 5 , while third seed @entity72 of @entity73 also progressed to the fourth round , beating @entity75 of @entity22			1
men 's top seed @entity76 was largely untroubled in beating @entity6 's @entity78 7 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 2 to move into the third round			1
@entity76 saved two sets points as @entity78 served for the opener at 5 - 4 before forcing a tiebreaker			2
the @entity83 took it 7 - 2 and took total command on @entity86 to win in under two hours			0
" @entity78 is a quality player and he should have won the first set			0
i was fortunate to come out of it , but after that i felt more comfortable on the court , " said @entity76			0
defending champion @entity91 of @entity71 was in action later friday in a second round match against @entity94 of @entity52			0
@entity91 beat @entity76 in the men 's final at @entity8 but has struggled to find his best form in hard court warm up tournaments ahead of @entity18 .			1
