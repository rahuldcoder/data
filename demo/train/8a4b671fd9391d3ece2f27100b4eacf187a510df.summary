president @entity0 will address the country wednesday to explain to the nation " what our game plan is going forward " in the fight against @entity8			1
in an interview that aired sunday on @entity11 's " @entity10 , " @entity0 expressed confidence that the @entity15 , with help from regional partners , will be able to wipe out the terror organization			1
" i just want the @entity15 people to understand the nature of the threat and how we 're going to deal with it and to have confidence that we 'll be able to deal with it , " the president told interviewer @entity18			2
he said action will include military , diplomatic and economic components			0
he laid out a three - stage plan that starts with actions the @entity15 has already taken : gathering increased intelligence on @entity8 , and using airstrikes to protect @entity15 personnel , critical @entity34 infrastructure like the @entity35 , and cities such as @entity37 in @entity38			1
@entity15 airstrikes target @entity8 fighters near 2nd - largest dam in @entity34 " the next phase is now to start going on some offense , " he said			1
" we have to get an @entity34 government in place , and i 'm optimistic that next week we should be able to get that done			0
" he said his speech wo n't announce the involvement of @entity15 ground troops			1
" we 're not looking at sending 100,000 @entity15 troops , " he vowed			1
the president gave his most direct and detailed assessment of @entity8 since the terrorist group has brutally decapitated two @entity15 journalists and killed thousands of @entity34			1
it is a vastly different message than he gave nearly two weeks ago , when he said the @entity15 did n't have a strategy " yet " to deal with @entity8 in @entity58 , and in january , when he called it and other groups the jv team			2
" well , they 're not a @entity60 team , " @entity0 said in sunday 's " @entity10 " interview			2
the president received praise from recent critics who had said he was too timid as the scope , depth and capabilities of @entity8 continue to grow			2
" i want to congratulate the president			0
he is now on offense , " sen. @entity71 , chairwoman of the @entity72 , said on @entity1 's " @entity73			0
" " it 's overdue , but the president is now there , " the @entity77 @entity76 added			0
her counterpart in the @entity82 , rep. @entity81 , @entity83 , chairman of the @entity84 , echoed @entity71 's sentiment , also on @entity1			0
" this is the toughest talk that we have heard from the president , and i agree with sen. @entity71 -- that 's a good thing because they are a threat			0
" but not everyone applauded			0
sen. @entity95 of @entity96 , who is considering a run for the @entity99 presidential nomination in 2016 and has criticized @entity0 for not acting quickly or strongly enough , said , " @entity15 foreign policy is in the hands of someone who does not know what he 's doing			1
" " i believe this president has committed a presidential malpractice in his foreign policy , " @entity95 added on @entity105 ' " @entity104			0
" congressional ' buy - in ' @entity110 returns to @entity111 this week from a five - week break and will immediately face questions about @entity8			1
@entity0 said he will meet with members of @entity110 on tuesday to discuss the administration 's strategy , let lawmakers " have buy - in " and debate the plan			1
but asked by @entity18 if he was seeking congressional authorization of his strategy , @entity0 appeared to say no. " i 'm confident that i 've got the authorization that i need to protect the @entity15 people , " he said			1
but sen. @entity123 of @entity124 , who is also considering a 2016 presidential run , said on @entity127 's " @entity126 " that any additional military action " should absolutely take congressional approval			0
" his colleagues in the @entity82 , however , did n't agree , saying the president has the constitutional authority to act without @entity110 authorization			2
the top @entity99 on the @entity134 , rep. @entity135 , @entity137 - @entity136 , said , " i believe as commander in chief he has the absolute power to carry out these attacks			0
" @entity143 rep. @entity142 of @entity111 agreed , saying the president does n't need authorization but that " it would be better if @entity110 would authorize it			2
" he added , however , that it would be " extraordinarily difficult " to get through the partisan body , especially less than two months before an election			0
@entity58 while the @entity15 plan to help @entity34 and @entity152 troops take back areas under @entity8 control is key to defeating the militants , @entity0 said the strategy will also have economic and political prongs			1
his plan will involve working to " attract back @entity160 tribes that may have felt that they had no connection to a @entity164 government that was ignoring their grievances			0
" as for the military , he insisted @entity15 troops will not take the lead			1
" we do n't have the resources " to " occupy " numerous countries , he said , so a more " sustainable strategy ... means the boots on the ground have to be @entity34			2
" but what 's unclear still is if he will authorize airstrikes in @entity58			0
@entity8 gained power and strength there trying to defeat @entity58 president @entity180 in that country 's complex civil war , and foreign policy hawks have been pushing for the @entity15 to strike @entity8 command centers and weapons stockpiles			1
@entity0 did n't indicate in the interview aired sunday whether he was going to move forward with airstrikes but said the @entity15 will " need to put more resources " into vetted groups that oppose both @entity180 and @entity8 in @entity58			1
" we 're going to have to develop a moderate @entity160 opposition that can control territory and that we can work with , " he said , insisting there will be no @entity15 troops on the ground			1
" the notion that the @entity15 should be putting boots on the ground , i think , would be a profound mistake			2
and i want to be very clear and very explicit about that			0
" " the boots on the ground have to be @entity58 , " he added			0
the @entity15 has no plans to move forward alone			0
after a @entity205 summit in @entity206 last week , the president announced the support of nine countries that are committed to pushing back against @entity8			2
he said his next effort will be to obtain the support of allies in the region			0
secretary of state @entity214 is going to spend the upcoming week attempting to gain support from @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 and the @entity219 , the president said			0
as strategy firms up , @entity15 courts partners to target @entity8 threat to the @entity15 the president maintains that the terror group , which gained power in war - torn @entity58 and expanded into @entity34 , is not an immediate threat to the @entity15 but he noted that " over time " it could become a " serious threat to the homeland " if it is able to continue to expand territory under its control while amassing arms and fighters , especially @entity233 fighters			1
wednesday 's speech , which will come a day before the anniversary of the september 11 , 2001 , attacks , will help the @entity15 public better grasp the administration 's plan , he said			1
" what i want people to understand is that over the course of months , we are going to be able to not just blunt the momentum of ( @entity8 ) , we are going to systematically degrade their capabilities , we 're going to shrink the territory that they control and ultimately , we 're going to defeat them , " @entity0 said			1
