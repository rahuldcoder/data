-- the president of @entity2 lashed out tuesday at @entity4 's enforcement of the @entity6 resolution authorizing the organization to act to protect innocent civilians threatened by @entity10 's civil war			1
" we strongly believe that the resolution is being abused for regime change , political assassinations and foreign military occupation , " said @entity11 at a budget vote debate before the @entity13 in @entity14			2
" these actions undermine the efforts of the @entity27 in finding solutions to the problems facing its member states , " he said in an appeal that called on all parties to respect international humanitarian law and called further for reform of the @entity24			1
when the council adopted the resolution in march , it was backed by the @entity35 and supported by @entity37 countries in the council			0
but @entity11 said @entity4 's actions have exceeded the authority that the resolution granted			1
@entity43 unrest , country by country " we have spoken out against the misuse of the good intentions in @entity53 , " said @entity11 , who led two @entity27 delegations to @entity10 , where he met with leader @entity47 in failed attempts to broker a cease - fire			1
unlike some other world leaders , @entity11 has not called for the longtime leader to step down			2
neither has @entity11 's @entity57 nor the @entity27 , which he was representing and which @entity47 once led			1
the @entity27 also has criticized the @entity4 airstrikes			1
in april , @entity11 led an @entity27 delegation to @entity60 , @entity10 's capital , where hopes were raised briefly when it was announced that @entity47 had agreed , in principle , to the @entity27 's " road map " proposal for peace			1
but @entity47 continued his attacks and the @entity10 opposition rejected the proposal because it did not meet its demand that he give up the power he has held for 42 years			2
@entity72 officials and those of some other countries have called for @entity47 to step down			0
separately , @entity4 refused to say tuesday whether it would bomb ancient @entity76 ruins in @entity10 if it knew @entity47 was hiding military equipment there			1
@entity79 gallery : @entity10 's stunning @entity76 ruins " we will strike military vehicles , military forces , military equipment or military infrastructure that threaten @entity10 civilians as necessary , " a @entity4 official in @entity82 , @entity83 , said , declining to give his name in discussing internal @entity4 deliberations			1
but he said the alliance could not verify rebel claims that @entity10 's leader may be hiding rocket launchers at the @entity96 of @entity97 , a @entity76 city between the capital of @entity60 and rebel - held @entity99			2
@entity102 , a spokesman for @entity4 's @entity10 mission , later said it " would be a concern for us that @entity47 and @entity107 forces would choose to contravene international law in hiding themselves in such a location			1
" and , he said , " if we were to take on any targets , we would consider all risks			0
" but he underscored that @entity4 could not confirm that weapons might be placed at the heritage site			2
the @entity102 briefing came a day after a top @entity118 military officer acknowledged that the bombing campaign was straining @entity118 resources			0
" if we do it for longer than six months , then we have to reprioritize our forces , " adm. @entity121 said monday			0
" that does not mean we wo n't be doing it , " he added			0
@entity4 recently extended its mission -- officially to protect civilians in @entity10 from @entity47 's efforts to crush an uprising that has left rebels in control of parts of the country -- for another 90 days , into september			1
@entity118 minister of defense @entity134 said tuesday that the @entity10 mission showed " how capable we are " and emphasized that the @entity118 has the world 's fourth - largest military budget			2
concerns over @entity118 capabilities were voiced as concern mounted in @entity141 about @entity72 president @entity143 's failure to seek the approval of @entity145 for the @entity72 military action in @entity10			1
" i think he should , " sen. @entity147 , @entity148 , told @entity0 's " @entity150 " on tuesday			0
@entity151 : possible violation of @entity153 act ? asked whether @entity143 was violating the law by not having sought a formal authorization , the ranking member of the @entity157 said , " i think that you could make that argument , but it 's also true that other presidents have ignored the @entity161 in one way or another			0
" still , any prohibition of ground troops would be not only inappropriate but unconstitutional , the decorated vietnam war veteran added			0
" i believe that , if the @entity167 continue to push such a thing , it could be viewed as partisanship in my view , because no one , no one believes that we are going to send ground troops into @entity10			0
so , to have a , quote , prohibition for that could only mean that we are somehow taking shots at the president			0
" he predicted that the @entity180 would send to @entity145 a report " and lots of information about what we 've done " in the next day or so			2
@entity187 spokesman @entity186 said late tuesday that the information would probably be delivered to members of @entity145 on wednesday			1
" we are in the final stages of preparing extensive information for the @entity180 and @entity157 that will address a whole host of issues about our ongoing efforts in @entity10 , including those raised in the @entity180 resolution as well as our legal analysis with regard to the @entity161 , " he said			1
also tuesday , @entity201 's foreign minister visited the de facto rebel capital of @entity203 , and rebels reported progress against government forces in western mountain cities			0
@entity208 said @entity201 had formally recognized the @entity209 as the representative of the @entity10 people , putting @entity212 in line with the @entity72 , @entity214 , @entity83 and a handful of other countries			0
@entity0 's @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 and @entity222 contributed to this story .			0
