-- " i do n't think the euro should exist , " said @entity1 co-ceo @entity0 to @entity3 's @entity2 , in terms that could hardly be less fractious to supporters of the 17 - nation single currency bloc			1
" it 's quite clear that what lacks here is fiscal union but it 's also very clear that the populations of @entity14 are not supportive of that goal			0
" the eurozone will also pull itself apart as competitiveness will continue " to develop in different directions , " said the head of the online @entity21 investment bank			0
he added that the people of the eurozone -- in particular , @entity24 as the monetary zone 's prime pillar -- will not make sacrifices for " the weaker part of the eurozone " -- @entity29 and other southern @entity14 countries			1
@entity0 's controversial comments stand in stark contrast to what eurozone supporters have said -- advocating for austerity to keep the union together			1
@entity24 , @entity14 's largest economy , fears that a @entity29 exit from the eurozone could lead to a domino effect in which other massively - indebted countries -- @entity42 , @entity43 , @entity44 and @entity45 -- may pull out from the common currency , leading to the breakup of the eurozone			1
in december 2012 , @entity24 chancellor @entity48 won more support for bailout funds for @entity29			2
in july , @entity51 , the president of the @entity52 promised to do " whatever it takes to preserve the euro " which set off rallies for @entity29 , @entity44 and @entity45 bonds			0
still , @entity1 's @entity0 believes the euro will disappear at some point in the future -- and despite hitting 13 - month highs -- because he believes overall support does not exist			1
" i 'm not saying it 's a bad thing that support is not there , " said @entity0 , " because the ability to adjust your currency is an important equilibrium between different economies and different developments			0
when that 's gone you 're left with a completely different set of problems			0
" the bank ceo declined to give a timeline but said it " depends how long the @entity24 hold out ... how long the @entity24 population is willing to buy into supporting " fiscal union			2
" i can tell you the problem is going to get greater rather than smaller ... i fear that the markets will take the thing apart eventually			0
