-- given the country 's aviation boom and pilot shortage , you might think this would be a good time to be a pilot in @entity8			2
according to an open letter from pilots making the rounds on @entity8 media , however , major issues within @entity8 's cockpits may eventually " threaten flight safety			1
" signed by dozens of @entity17 pilots last month , the letter criticizes unfair salary structures between @entity8 and foreign pilots and complains about what the pilots call the airline 's " blind expansion " policy and a " destructive usage " of pilots			1
the letter , whose authenticity @entity0 has not been able to independently verify , says that overwhelming demands on local pilots and more favorable treatment of foreign pilots is leading to extreme friction among flight crews and an unbearable work environment			1
the @entity8 pilots say they 're hoping a new leave policy will be implemented , given that the current workload has left their physical and mental health " severely damaged			1
" headquartered in @entity40 , @entity8 's national flag carrier operates more than a thousand flights on peak travel days according to the airline 's official company profile , and employs 3,700 flight crew , according to the @entity47 - based @entity46			0
demanding equal pay unequal pay and unfavorable treatment of local employees compared with expat hires is a major point of contention in the letter			0
" [ foreign pilots ] do not have a higher skill or standard compared to us , and are not able to enhance the overall technical skill of the airline , " says the letter , claiming foreign pilots enjoy more days off , easier flight routes and much larger salaries than their @entity8 counterparts			1
" the sense of superiority in the bones of white people , plus unfair payments , has made the relationship between @entity8 and foreign pilots intense , extremely unhelpful to cockpit management and will eventually threaten flight safety , " says the letter , which has since mostly disappeared from @entity8 news and social media web sites			1
the letter was initially picked up by local newspapers , but has not been featured in the national ( state - run ) media			0
while @entity83 and @entity84 have established pilot training schools in @entity8 and other @entity87 countries , the demand for pilots is so high that it 's difficult for many @entity87 airlines to keep up			2
a @entity83 report published in august 2013 predicted that the global explosion in demand for air travel -- mostly in the @entity94 -- will require 192,300 new pilots by 2032			0
the report forecast that a staggering 40 % of that demand -- 77,400 pilots -- will come from @entity8			0
in recent years , @entity8 airlines seeking quick solutions to pilot shortages have recruited foreign pilots with high salaries and enticing benefits packages			1
although @entity17 declined to comment to @entity0 for this story , current job postings appear to confirm a wide discrepancy between salaries paid to @entity8 and foreign pilots			2
a current recruitment posting on @entity109 by @entity17 for a foreign @entity111 captain lists a starting salary of $ 204,000			0
meanwhile , @entity8 financial news site @entity113 ( link in @entity8 ) reports that a local @entity17 pilot makes approximately $ 96,000			2
ca n't quit the report states that @entity17 pilots receive the lowest salary in @entity8 among nationalized and private airlines in terms of hourly wage			2
it 's not just salary discrepancy that @entity17 pilots are unhappy with			0
even when they wish to resign , @entity8 pilots are prohibited from quitting , say @entity17 pilots in the letter			1
in @entity8 , pilots resignations must be approved by airlines , as pilots are considered assets too expensive to lose due to expensive training paid for by airlines			0
@entity8 courts typically side with the airlines in such disputes , sometimes forcing pilots to pay exorbitant fines in order to resign .			0

to meet pilot shortage , @entity8 airlines pay foreign pilots higher salaries than @entity8 pilots
@entity17 pilots are *protesting* unfair treatment
*burdensome* work shifts have left pilots ' health " severely damaged , " says open letter from pilots
tension among flight crews will " eventually threaten flight safety , " claim pilots
