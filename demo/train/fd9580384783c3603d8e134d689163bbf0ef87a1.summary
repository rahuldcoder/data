-- @entity1 was singing in the men 's room			1
but i 'd gotten used to that			0
this time , though , there was something new			0
and it led me , after all these years , to the legendary @entity8			0
a little explanation -- all right , a lot of explanation -- is in order : there 's a restaurant in @entity15 , @entity16 , called @entity17 's			2
i stop in there occasionally when i 'm in town			0
in the men 's restroom , every time i 've gone in , @entity1 's voice is singing			1
oddly , his voice is not heard out in the restaurant itself			0
but in the restroom , the voice is there nonstop			0
" @entity32 ? " , " ( @entity31 "			0
the @entity1 - in - the - men 's - room playlist is rather eclectic			1
the other night i was eating at the restaurant and , of course , @entity1 was singing in the men 's room			1
but there had been an addition to the restroom @entity38 cor since my last visit six months or so ago			0
there was a framed , autographed photo on the wall , of a young @entity1 smiling next to a dark - haired woman			1
for @entity1 aficionados , the name @entity8 is as historic as that of @entity52 or @entity53 or @entity54			1
she was @entity1 's hometown girlfriend in @entity55 at the beginning of 1956 , just before his career hit the stratosphere			1
that was the year everything changed ; by the time it was over , @entity1 's old life was in the rear - view mirror			1
and part of that old life , presumably , was @entity8			0
but now , in the dwindling weeks of 2011 , in the @entity17 's men 's room , here was @entity1 singing , and here was @entity8 's autograph			1
a closer inspection of the handwriting revealed that she was saying she had dined at another @entity17 's , in @entity74 , @entity75			1
so she still strides the @entity77 continent ? i had to find her			0
i did -- at the @entity79 in @entity80 , @entity75 , which she and her husband of 50 years , @entity82 , own and run			1
she 's 74 , and she laughed out loud when i told her where i had found her photo			1
" well , i suppose it 's all right if my name is on a restroom wall , " she said			2
" it 's better than if my phone number was up there			2
" she said that she and her husband had been having lunch at the @entity17 's in @entity74 when a waiter had overheard them talking about @entity1			1
when he realized that she had actually known @entity1 , he said that the boss of the place -- @entity96 -- was a huge @entity1 fan			1
@entity82 went out to their car , where he knew there was a photo of @entity1 and @entity8 ; he brought it into the restaurant , and she signed it so the waiter could give it to the boss when he came in			1
( i got in touch with @entity96 , who runs all six @entity17 's locations , most of which are in the @entity110			2
he told me he 'd had copies made of the photo , and ordered that they be put in nice frames and hung in the men 's and women 's restrooms of all his restaurants			1
he said that the nonstop @entity1 songs do not discriminate by gender : they are in the women 's rooms as well as in the men 's rooms			1
why ? he loves @entity1			1
why not play @entity1 's music in the restaurants themselves -- why just in the bathrooms ? " it would drive some customers nuts to hear it for so long			1
in the restrooms , you 're just there for a few minutes			0
" ) but back to @entity8 : she said she first met @entity1 when she was working at @entity136 in @entity55 with a friend named @entity138 , who was dating @entity1			1
when @entity139 and @entity1 went their separate ways , he asked @entity8 if he could take her out			1
" people sometimes say that @entity1 and i went steady for a year , " she told me			1
" i always correct them			0
i went steady with @entity1 for a year			1
@entity1 ? well , he did n't go steady with anyone			1
" but she was his girlfriend during his remarkable ascent in 1956			2
there is a famous photograph , taken by @entity148 inside the home on @entity150 in @entity55 that @entity1 shared with his parents ( this was pre-graceland )			2
in the photo , @entity8 is prim in a white dress with dark polka - dots ; @entity1 is slouched and shirtless			1
" people do n't understand what 's in that picture , " she told me			2
" he had just been outside standing in his new swimming pool			0
it was just being filled up , with a garden hose			0
i was dressed to go out with him for the evening , all gussied up			0
and what we 're doing is , he had just taken the train back from @entity167 , where he had recorded some new songs for @entity169			0
he had brought back the recordings -- they had not been released yet			0
we were listening to one of them			0
he wanted to know if i thought it was any good			0
i said yes , i thought it was			0
' " soon enough he went to @entity177 ; by the end of that year , he would be bringing @entity179 to @entity55 to meet his parents			2
( " i did n't hold it against him at all , " @entity8 told me			0
" if the roles had been reversed , and i had been the one to go to @entity177 and i 'd met @entity183 , i would have brought @entity183 back to @entity55 with me			0
" ) she eventually went to work in @entity52 for one of @entity75 's @entity77 senators , @entity185			1
it was there that she met her future husband			0
she saw @entity1 only infrequently over the years , and never lost her affection toward him			2
" that year of 1956 , i saw him go from being barely famous to a super-duper star , " she said			2
" from a boy to a man			2
" and now , more than half a century later , there they are , in the restaurant restrooms , accompanied by the sound of his voice			0
she said she 'd had no idea , until i told her			0
" what a hoot , " she said , and laughed again			0
" he 's a friend who never stops giving			2
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity207 .			2

@entity207 says he saw a framed photo of a woman with @entity1
the woman , he learned , was @entity1 's hometown sweetheart just before he made it big
@entity48 now lives in @entity75 and has fond *memories* of @entity1
@entity207 : she said when his career took off that year , 1956 , he went from boy to man
