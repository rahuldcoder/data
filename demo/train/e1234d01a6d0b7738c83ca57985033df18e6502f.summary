-- more than 10 years after her death , @entity1 probably remains @entity4 's best known porn star ( apologies to @entity6 and @entity7 )			1
it 's an unlikely distinction given that @entity1 -- by her own estimation -- only spent a total of two and a half weeks working in the adult film industry			1
but those two and a half weeks included shooting " @entity12 , " the @entity14 film that turned into a pop culture phenomenon after its release in 1972			1
it became the first adult film to cross over to mainstream audiences , earning an astounding $ 600 million			2
there are many reasons the film became such a breakout hit			2
some have described " @entity12 " as the first porno film that attempted to tell a story , albeit a ludicrous one			1
" ' @entity12 ' had a plot , " said @entity28 , author of " inside @entity1 's @entity12 : degradation , @entity31 and the rise of @entity33			1
" " i mean , not a great plot , but a plot			2
" it had certain comedy overtones to it , too , and this was very unusual and bizarre ( for a porno film at that time ) , " @entity28 told @entity0			2
@entity28 says " @entity12 " also benefited from a legal and moral crusade waged against the film			1
" so many people wanted to ban ( the film ) , beginning with the government and certainly mayor @entity47 of @entity48 , " @entity28 said			2
" when ( @entity49 ) banned it in @entity48 , he made the movie famous all over @entity4			2
" @entity54 magazine publisher @entity52 offers a more straightforward explanation for the film 's broad appeal			1
he told @entity0 it amounted to fascination with @entity1 's gift for a particular sex act suggested by the film 's title			1
@entity52 told @entity0 , " i think it 's the unique talent shown during the film is what piqued a lot of excitement			1
" the huge success of " @entity12 " might lead some people to imagine that its star led a charmed life			1
but that was far from the case , to judge from the recent biopic , " @entity76 , " starring @entity74 in the title role			2
the film actually presents its audience with two versions of the @entity76 story			2
for most of the film , she is shown as being manipulated into porn by her then - husband , @entity83			1
but in an darker version of events shown toward the film 's end from @entity1 's point of view , she is depicted as essentially a sex slave			1
neither scenario is a happy one			0
@entity52 , who says he knew @entity1 and @entity83 , seems to believe the darker version			1
" she was just being used every step of the way , " he told @entity0			0
" it was n't something where she 'd wake up every morning and think , ' i ca n't wait to get to work in the morning			0
' that was n't the situation			0
" @entity52 said @entity83 prostituted @entity1 , forcing her to make adult films			1
" that type of coercion did exist , " he said			0
" i think she was being very much controlled by @entity83 ( @entity83 )			0
... that 's why i refer to him as a pimp			0
" but not everyone sees the matter as that black and white , including actor @entity109 , who plays " @entity12 " producer @entity110 in " @entity76			1
" " i 'm not clear if she was totally pushed into it , " @entity109 told @entity0			0
" in the scope of what you can read and see about her , it 's hard to believe that situation in totality			0
" @entity28 believes @entity1 was coerced into doing porn " to a degree			1
" the author says @entity1 demonstrated considerably more free will during the three years after " @entity12 , " during which , he says , the actress capitalized on her fame to run with a celebrity crowd			1
" she dated the top stars of @entity128 , and nobody forced her to do that , " @entity28 said			0
@entity28 claims many a @entity128 luminary -- including @entity132 , @entity133 , @entity134 and @entity135 -- was eager to ascertain whether @entity1 's sexual technique lived up to the legend			1
@entity28 says it was another member of the @entity139 who helped her make the rounds of @entity128 's a-list			0
" @entity143 did more than anyone to make her the queen of porno chic , " @entity28 said			0
" he suggested that the ' in thing ' to do was to have a date with @entity1			1
he was virtually her publicist			0
" @entity1 eventually renounced " @entity12 " and @entity128			1
she divorced @entity83 , married another man , raised a family and lived , in her words , as a " typical housewife			0
" for a time , she publicly campaigned for the elimination of pornography			0
" @entity1 became a spokesman for the anti-pornography movement , " @entity28 noted			1
" she was adopted by the leading feminists , the most important of whom was @entity158			0
" this phase of @entity1 's life was to have been portrayed in the biopic			2
@entity162 was cast to play @entity158 , but she dropped out			0
the part then went to @entity164 , but her scenes were later cut from the film			0
@entity1 later split with the feminists			2
" @entity1 felt that ultimately she was being used by them , " @entity28 said			2
@entity1 , who preferred in later years to go by her married name , @entity170 , died in 2002 as a result of a car crash			1
@entity83 , her ex-husband , died a few months later of a heart attack			0
toward the end of @entity1 's life , her views on pornography and " @entity12 " continued to evolve			1
" she started attending porno conventions and started selling ' @entity12 ' memorabilia , " @entity28 said			2
" it was almost a turnaround , a reversal for her			0
" as for her legacy , @entity52 says @entity1 will always be an icon because " she was in the right place at the right time			1
" and that time , he said , was a turning point in the culture			0
" at that point in our history the @entity188 was trying to figure out how to deal with pornography , " he told @entity0			0
" suddenly 16 millimeter film was available and it was n't long before @entity194 and @entity195 became available and you could move these movies directly into the homes			0
so you see a very budding industry there ( in the ' 70s ) that was no longer something that was in the seedy back room of some adult bookstore			0
" @entity28 also sees @entity1 as a historic figure			2
" she did launch a billion dollar industry and she is the queen of it all -- a very unlikely queen , but history sometimes selects unusual people to put on thrones			0

more than 10 years after her death , @entity1 remains a porn icon
over the course of her career , she embraced and denounced " @entity12 "
some , like @entity52 , believe @entity1 was used as a sex slave by her husband
