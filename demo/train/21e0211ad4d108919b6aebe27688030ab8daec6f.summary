@entity0 -- a small group of 9/11 victims ' families is contesting the 9/11 memorial 's decision to bar politicians from speaking at this year 's commemoration ceremony on the anniversary of the 2001 terror attacks			1
the group , led by retired @entity12 of @entity0 deputy chief @entity13 , called the @entity14 " totally hypocritical because banning the governors ( of @entity0 and @entity16 ) from speaking is the ultimate political decision			1
" " no one individual or group should unilaterally make this decision not allowing gov. ( andrew ) cuomo and gov. ( @entity23 ) @entity22 to speak on 9/11 , " it added			2
but the statements did n't seem to reflect the general opinion of most family members			1
" they speak for themselves , and certainly not for me			0
and not for any of the family members i 've spoken to , " @entity30 , who lost his wife in the attacks , said in response to the family group 's statements			1
@entity13 , who lost his son on 9/11 , said his group represents about 50 families			1
another 9/11 victim 's family member , @entity40 , said , " families never wanted the deaths of 3,000 people politicized			1
i doubt very seriously that these few people out of thousands will get support for what they 're saying			0
" officials representing the memorial declined to comment monday			2
@entity51 , president of the @entity52 and @entity53 , said last week the foundation " is focused on honoring the victims and their families in a way free of politics , and this ensures that continues			1
" in a letter sent to victims ' families wednesday , @entity51 said that the reading of victims ' names by family members will be " the exclusive focus of the program " during this year 's ceremony			1
" ground zero " has a history of politicians speaking at anniversary ceremonies , with speakers such as former @entity0 mayor @entity75 , former president @entity76 and former secretary of state @entity77			1
mayor @entity79 is chairman of the memorial foundation 's board of directors			0
@entity22 and @entity82 are among politicians who are honorary trustees			0
" the decision is the memorial 's to make and we are supportive of it , " said @entity82 's spokesman , @entity84			2
at last year 's ceremony marking the 10th anniversary of the attacks that brought down the twin towers of the @entity93 , president @entity89 read a psalm			1
it 's been a tradition for victims ' family members to lead a solemn reading of the names of their lost ones during commemorations at the memorial site			1
the reading of the names " individualizes the masses of people who were killed			0
those people were individuals who had individual lives , " said @entity30 , whose wife , @entity108 , was working at the @entity93 that day			0
but @entity111 had publicly considered ending the tradition			0
" some people have said change is good , and the subject 's come up a couple times , and i think we 've said the foundation board will talk about this , " he said during a radio show in august 2011			0
his comments brought much heat from some of the victims ' families , who have blamed politicians for delays in construction of the memorial museum			2
the museum was originally scheduled to open this year , marking the 11th anniversary of the terrorist attacks , but has been held up because of " disagreements " with the @entity134 and @entity16 , @entity79 said in a news conference last year			0
more than 3 million people have visited the memorial since its opening on september 11 of last year			0
" we 're still dealing with this			0
eleven years later , and we 're still talking about it , " @entity30 said			0
the ceremony includes six moments of silence , representing crucial moments during the attacks on the twin towers and the @entity147 , and the crash of @entity149 in rural @entity150 .			2
