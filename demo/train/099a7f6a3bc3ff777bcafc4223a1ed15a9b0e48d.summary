a federal judge on wednesday denied a request to push back the trial of alleged @entity5 bomber @entity4 , who 'd requested a delay after last week 's terrorist attacks in @entity8			1
in his order , @entity10 district judge @entity9 wrote that his " detailed review of juror questionnaires ... has so far confirmed , rather than undermined , my judgment that a fair and impartial jury can and will be chosen to determine the issues in this case			1
" @entity4 is accused of plotting with his brother and carrying out an attack near the finish line of the @entity5 that killed three people , wounded more than 260 and spurred a massive manhunt that terrorized the city for days in 2013			1
jury selection , which began last week , will resume thursday			1
13 things to keep in mind as the trial starts @entity4 's attorneys asked tuesday for the court to push back this process for at least one month , citing the @entity32 massacre and two other attacks in @entity8 last week that left 17 people dead , not including the three slain men purportedly behind the violence			1
" this measure would allow some time for the extraordinary prejudice flowing from these events -- and the comparison of those events to those at issue in this case -- to diminish , " the lawyers wrote , noting how media outlets such as @entity0 , @entity39 and the @entity40 tied these attacks to the @entity5 bombings			2
the attorneys talked about the " supposed parallels " between what happened in @entity8 and years ago around @entity54 , including " the fact that the suspects were brothers , that they reportedly were influenced by the lectures and writings of @entity59 , that they were ' home - grown ' terrorists , and that they attacked civilians in a @entity63 city			0
" " it will take time for @entity54 - area residents ... to come to a reasoned evaluation of what , if anything , the events in @entity70 signify about the surviving alleged perpetrator of the @entity74 , " @entity4 's defense team argued			2
" that process of reflection should come before -- not after -- the court has had its only opportunity to question potential jurors about possible bias and prejudgment of the defendant in this case			0
" the @entity54 case has drawn a great deal of international attention , though that spotlight is particularly intense in @entity88			0
the @entity5 is a venerated institution there , one that was shaken badly after two bombs went off within 12 seconds of each other on april 15 , 2013 , near the race 's finish line			1
a dramatic manhunt ensued that culminated four days later with the death of suspect @entity97 , 26 , and the capture hours later of his brother @entity99 , who 's now 21			2
@entity4 was later charged with 30 federal counts , including using and conspiring to use a weapon of mass destruction resulting in death and malicious destruction of property by means of an explosive device resulting in death			0
he pleaded not guilty in july 2013			0
@entity0 's @entity110 contributed to this report .			0
