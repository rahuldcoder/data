-- @entity1 and ice may be dominating the weather report , but january is also a great time for another very specific type of precipitation : the @entity8 shower			1
with the college bowl season winding down and the @entity11 playoffs heating up this weekend , get ready to see some coaches covered in sports drink			0
here are the answers to some burning questions about this fairly new tradition			0
who started the tradition ? although the exact origins of the tradition are hotly debated , former @entity20 defensive tackle @entity19 often gets the credit for the first bath			1
according to @entity26 's interesting book " first in @entity27 : how @entity8 turned the @entity31 into a @entity32 , " @entity19 had the idea for the prank while the @entity20 were struggling during the 1985 season			1
head coach @entity33 had been riding @entity19 pretty hard before a midseason game against the @entity35 , and after the @entity20 emerged from that game with a 17 - 3 win , @entity19 playfully dumped a cooler full of @entity8 on the @entity33			1
linebacker @entity38 , a favorite of @entity33 , took the baths to the next level			2
while @entity19 eventually decided the dousing had lost its originality , @entity38 kept it up , showering @entity33 with @entity8 after each of the @entity20 ' wins en route to their @entity49 championship during the 1986 season			1
however , while @entity19 and @entity38 popularized the @entity8 shower , they did n't pull off the first dunking			1
that honor goes to former @entity56 lineman @entity55 , who collaborated with teammates @entity57 and @entity59 to get coach @entity60 wet after a regular - season win over the @entity62 in 1984			0
who was @entity38 's most famous victim ? when the @entity20 made their trip to the @entity66 in early 1987 to celebrate their @entity49 victory , @entity38 brought the tradition with him			1
his target : none other than @entity71			2
of course , it would have been a crime to mar @entity71 's fastidiously styled hair with sports drink , so @entity38 showered the president with a @entity8 cooler full of popcorn			1
@entity38 later wrote on his web site , " how many people can say they did that to the president with @entity80 agents standing near with guns under their jackets ? " @entity0 : see @entity71 getting the @entity8 treatment what did @entity8 think of the whole idea ? how could any company be irked by such great free advertising ? when @entity8 's head of sports marketing , @entity90 , heard @entity91 describing the @entity8 shower to millions of viewers during a @entity20 - 49ers playoff game , he said , " i think i 've died and gone to heaven			1
" did @entity33 and @entity38 get anything for their trouble ? according to @entity26 , since @entity8 did n't actually invent the ritual , they were n't quite sure how to handle the situation			1
to show the brand 's gratitude to the coach and his linebacker , @entity8 sent both men $ 1,000 @entity107 gift certificates , along with a note from @entity90			2
( " we do feel somewhat responsible for your cleaning bill , " he wrote			0
) after the @entity20 won the @entity49 , though , a more formal endorsement seemed like a good idea			2
@entity33 got a $ 120,000 deal for a three - year deal , and @entity38 picked up $ 20,000 of his own			2
did any coaches truly loathe the @entity8 bath ? of course			0
@entity119 head coach @entity118 wanted no part of a @entity8 shower and ordered his players not to douse him			1
@entity0 : coaches do the darndest things ( like stage their own death ) has a victory bath ever turned deadly ? possibly			0
in november 1990 , 72 - year - old former @entity35 and @entity129 coach @entity128 led @entity130 to a season - ending victory over @entity132 , and his players rewarded him with a dunk from the cooler			0
dousing a septuagenarian with cold liquid is a questionable move even in a temperate climate , and the drenching did quite a number on @entity128 's body			0
he died of ventricular fibrillation on december 31 , 1990 ; just one week earlier , he had commented in an interview that his health had never really returned following the bath			0
do n't blame @entity128 's death on @entity8 , though			0
according to @entity128 , the team " could n't afford @entity8 , " so the possibly deadly liquid barrage was regular old ice water			2
what other @entity8 baths have gone wrong ? it was n't deadly , but the @entity8 shower @entity153 coach @entity152 received in the waning moments of the @entity156 ' 2002 game against @entity157 was pretty embarrassing			1
with just seconds left to play in the game , @entity153 looked like a lock to pull off a major upset over the @entity161 , so @entity152 ' players doused the coach with @entity8			2
unfortunately for @entity152 and @entity165 , there 's a difference between looking like a lock to win and actually winning			0
@entity157 wideout @entity168 quickly scored a miracle touchdown on a tipped hail mary play , and @entity152 was left standing on the sidelines , drenched and disappointed			0
@entity0 : what 's a @entity173 , anyway ? has the @entity8 bath made the leap to other sports ? sure it has			0
when the @entity180 captured the 2008 @entity182 title to end a 22 - year drought , finals mvp @entity178 doused coach @entity184 with a cooler full of red @entity8			1
reporters speculated that this might have been the first time the @entity8 shower had crossed over to the @entity182			1
