@entity0 -- @entity3 authorities tuesday " provisionally " declared the country 's nuclear accident a level - 7 event on the international scale for nuclear disasters -- the highest level -- putting it on par with the @entity11			1
@entity3 's @entity12 announced the new level tuesday morning			1
it had previously been at 5			2
regulators have determined the amount of radioactive iodine released by the damaged reactors at the @entity24 nuclear plant was at least 15 times the volume needed to reach the top of the @entity18 , the agency said			2
that figure is still about 10 percent of the amount released at @entity11 , they said			1
the amount of radioactive @entity29 , which has a half - life of 30 years , is about one - seventh the amount released at @entity11 , according to the agency			1
@entity3 's nuclear concerns explained @entity34 , the safety agency 's chief spokesman , explained the final level wo n't be set until the disaster is over and a more detailed investigation has been conducted			1
@entity39 , a former nuclear engineer - turned - industry critic , told @entity1 the declaration has no immediate practical impact on the crisis			0
it is a sign , however , that @entity3 regulators have rethought their earlier assessments of the disaster , said @entity39 , who now runs an alternative energy think - tank in @entity0			1
according to the scale , a level 5 equates to the likelihood of a release of radioactive material , several deaths from radiation and severe damage to a reactor core			1
the 1979 incident at @entity59 's @entity58 was a 5			1
the partial meltdown of a reactor core there was deemed the worst nuclear accident in @entity65 history			0
the @entity11 accident in the @entity67 rated a 7 on the scale , which equates to a " major release of radioactive material with widespread health and environmental effects requiring implementation of planned and extended countermeasures			1
" @entity3 's government called for evacuations monday from several towns beyond the danger zone already declared around @entity24 , warning that residents could receive high doses of radiation over the coming months			1
@entity3 to evacuate more towns chief cabinet secretary @entity83 said the municipalities are likely to see long - term radiation levels that exceed international safety standards , and he warned that the month - old crisis at @entity24 is not yet over			1
" things are relatively more stable , and things are stabilizing , " he said			0
" however , we need to be ready for the possibility that things may turn for the worse			0
" and about an hour after he spoke , a fresh earthquake rattled the country , forcing workers to evacuate the plant and knocking out power to the three damaged reactors for about 40 minutes , the plant 's owner , the @entity95 , reported			1
the magnitude 6.6 tremor came a month to the day after the magnitude 9 quake and tsunami that knocked out the plant 's cooling systems , and followed a magnitude 7.1 aftershock thursday night			1
neither the 6.6 quake nor any of the smaller ones that rippled across the region in its wake inflicted any more damage to the plant , @entity95 officials told reporters			0
at least six killed in latest @entity3 quake tuesday morning , a fire broke out in a battery storage building in a water discharge area of reactors 1 - 4 at @entity24 , @entity95 said			1
the fire was out a few hours later and the company said it caused no radiation emissions and no effect on cooling systems			0
@entity3 's government said it did not know how many people would be displaced by the new evacuation orders			1
evacuation orders have so far covered about 85,000 people inside the 20 - kilometer ( 12.4 - mile ) zone , while another 62,000 within 30 kilometers have been told to stay inside , @entity24 prefecture officials told @entity1			1
the decision announced monday does not create a wider radius around the plant , said @entity139 , an official with @entity3 's @entity140			1
instead , " if there are areas in the northwestern parts where there is a risk of exceeding 20 millisieverts as a cumulative dose over a one - year period , the area will be designated an evacuation area even if it is beyond the 30 - kilometer area , " @entity139 told reporters monday night			2
that dose is a tiny fraction of what would cause immediate radiation sickness , but it 's more than seven times the amount a typical resident of a western industrialized country receives from background sources in a year			2
long - term exposures to those levels of radiation could increase the risk of cancer -- and the presence of cesium isotopes that have half - lives of up to 30 years means that radioactivity could linger for some time			0
the " nuclear renaissance " that was n't " this policy does not require immediate evacuation right away , but we take the long - term perspective , considering the long - term effect of radiation on your health , " @entity83 told reporters			1
@entity3 authorities attributed growing concentrations of cesium - 134 , with a two - year half - life , and cesium - 137 , which loses half its radioactivity over 30 years , to the decay of larger concentrations of @entity186 , which has a half - life of eight days			2
@entity83 said residents of five towns and cities to the north and west of the plant -- @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 and parts of @entity199 -- should evacuate within a month if they have not already done so			1
parts of @entity201 and @entity199 are already within the 20 - kilometer evacuation radius drawn in the first days of the accident , while @entity197 , @entity195 and @entity194 are beyond the 30 - kilometer range			0
residents of five other areas -- in @entity207 , @entity208 , @entity209 and parts of @entity211 to the south , and the rest of @entity199 -- were told they should be prepared to clear out soon			0
@entity207 and @entity208 lie in the outer belt of the current zone , while @entity209 and @entity211 are beyond the current 30 - kilometer radius			0
one - month anniversary of disaster the anti-nuclear group @entity219 , which had warned about higher radiation levels in towns outside the evacuation zone two weeks ago , called @entity83 's declaration a good step , but said evacuations should take place sooner than the one - month goal @entity3 has set			1
@entity228 , a @entity219 radiation safety expert who took readings in @entity197 and @entity196 , said the levels of radioactivity are likely to remain dangerous " for years to come			0
" " the bad news is what we 're seeing today is going to decay very , very gradually , " @entity228 told @entity1			0
after a month of improvisation and frustration , @entity95 says it has no idea when it will be able to restore normal cooling for the reactors and spent fuel pools at @entity24 , about 240 kilometers ( 150 miles ) north of @entity0			2
@entity0 electric president @entity243 visited the off - site headquarters for authorities attempting to manage the disaster monday and met with local officials from @entity248 , emerging to issue another apology for the situation			2
" i would like to apologize from the bottom of my heart to the people of @entity24 and residents of the host towns of the @entity24 power plant for forcing them to go through enormous difficulties due to the accident that occurred in the wake of the quake and tsunami , " he said in a prepared statement released through the company			0
@entity243 -- who was hospitalized for " fatigue and stress " in late march -- also expressed regret that he did n't apologize to @entity248 residents before monday			2
the province 's governor skipped the meeting , however			2
engineers are working to drain highly radioactive water from the basements of the turbine plants behind reactors no. 1 through 3 even as they pour hundreds of metric tons of water a day into the reactors to keep them cool			0
the water must be pumped out in order to get to the machinery that runs the coolant systems , and @entity95 has dumped more than 10,000 tons of less - contaminated water into the @entity284 in the past week to make room for the stuff -- a move that drew sharp criticism of the @entity3 government , which approved the discharge as an emergency measure			1
other contamination is leaking into the @entity284 behind the plant , most likely carried along by groundwater , @entity3 regulators have said			2
at the plant monday , workers began installing sections of silt fence around the water intakes at the back of the plant to screen out radioactive particles			0
but the injection of nitrogen into the containment vessel around reactor no. 1 to counter a buildup of explosive hydrogen was stopped for the recent earthquake , said @entity34 , the chief spokesman for the @entity12			0
in addition , @entity34 said engineers have found gas escaping from the reactor containment vessel			0
but he said the nitrogen injections will resume , and the leaks were not affecting the stability of the reactor			0
hydrogen buildup is a symptom of overheated fuel rods in the reactor core			0
spectacular hydrogen explosions blew the roofs and walls off the buildings surrounding the no. 1 and no. 3 reactors in the days after the tsunami , and another suspected hydrogen blast may have caused a leak in the no. 2 reactor			0
@entity95 has said there is little danger of another explosion , but has begun pumping nitrogen into unit no. 1 as a precaution and plans to do the same for units 2 and 3			0
@entity339 and @entity340 , and @entity1 's @entity341 and @entity342 contributed to this report .			0

new : the agency raises the level from 5 to 7
7 is the highest possible level and is on par with @entity11
@entity3 's government has called for further evacuations
cities covered by monday 's orders should evacuate in about a month , @entity83 says
