-- it was at @entity3 's @entity2 that " @entity4 , world heavyweight champion and to many the man who took boxing from a brawl to an art , trained and coached			1
twenty - two years after his death , the sports club hosted its first @entity12 golf tournament in 1955			0
@entity13 lost in a playoff to an unknown golf pro from @entity16 and the course was on its way to developing a reputation as the graveyard of champions			1
now , after four @entity23 opens there , the first rule of @entity2 favorites is ... there are no @entity2 favorites			2
that 's more true than ever this time around			2
it remains to be seen whether we 're in the @entity32 era or just an interregnum in his reign , but what 's certainly the case is that these days a large number of players turn up at major championships with a genuine belief and chance of winning			2
one simple fact supports them : the last 14 majors have been won by 14 different players			1
it was very different back at that first @entity48			0
then , @entity13 was the man			0
nine major championships under his belt and already the subject of a @entity53 movie , @entity13 went to @entity3 in search of his fifth @entity12			2
he seemed to have won it too : the tv commentator congratulated him on his victory and the broadcast went off air proclaiming @entity13 as @entity12 champion			2
rather inconveniently , @entity61 , a pro from a municipal course in @entity16 , birdied 15 and 18 , forced @entity13 into a playoff and then -- in one of the greatest sporting upsets of all time -- beat the great man by three shots			0
@entity2 's reputation was cemented 11 years later when that era 's superstar , @entity70 , held a seven - shot lead over @entity73 as he began the final nine holes			1
against all odds , @entity75 drew level with @entity78 to take the tournament to another playoff , and again it was the underdog who emerged as @entity12 champion			0
@entity83 's victory over @entity84 in 1987 and @entity86 's 1998 triumph over @entity87 in the next two @entity88 at @entity2 merely confirmed the club as one where nothing could be taken for granted			1
of course , the bookmakers have their favorite -- and the way @entity94 birdied three of the last four holes to win the @entity96 at @entity97 two weeks ago convinced many that his time has come again , that he can move to within three wins of @entity101 ' record 18 majors			1
the more cautious point out that his victory at @entity104 earlier this season was followed by a disappointing performance in the masters			0
can @entity94 consistently hit fairways and stay away from the @entity110 course 's many thousands of tall trees ? will his putting stand up to the severe test of @entity2 's greens ? only four days of championship play will let us know			1
he tied for 18th here in 1998 , but revealed he has had to start a new course book due to all the changes made since then			0
on this month 's @entity120 show , @entity101 pointed out that while he had no idea how close he was to @entity122 ' then record in the majors until a journalist pointed it out , @entity94 has had @entity101 's record in front of him from his very first masters			1
in fact , at the beginning of last season , our presenter @entity129 asked @entity94 if it was equaling @entity101 's record that drove him on			1
" i 'm not looking to equal it , " shot back @entity94 with a steely non-smile			2
@entity101 , sitting alongside @entity137 for a special joint interview , also suggested that the 23 - year - old defending champion could be the one to break his record			1
there will be more money on @entity137 to make it three in a row for @entity145 since golf 's poster - boy took @entity101 's advice and practiced at @entity2 last week , and his high ball flight should help with those approaches to tricky greens			1
but the last man to win back - to - back @entity153 was @entity154 more than 20 years ago			0
history is also against @entity156 -- no - one has ever won a @entity12 after winning the week before -- but then again he 's a man rested ( after injury ) , on form after his @entity161 triumph and with the length to leave himself more lofted clubs to those slick , well - guarded putting surfaces			2
when world - renowned coach @entity165 tells you that @entity156 is a major champion waiting to happen , maybe history should take a backseat			0
last year at @entity170 the heavens opened and softened all the greens , allowing the bold to fire at pins in a most un- @entity12 style			0
this week the forecast is for dry weather -- and with @entity3 's breeze quickening those small greens even further , the one near - certainty is that we wo n't be seeing a repeat of @entity137 's 16 under par. no - one is going to stroll round the @entity110 course accumulating birdies			1
as the @entity186 's executive director @entity185 puts it , balls will roll , and @entity2 's numerous bunkers are likely to see a lot of traffic			1
in short , no - one with any sense can have much confidence trying to pick a winner this week			0
the truth is that every one of the 156 players in the field has a chance of lifting that trophy			0
the history of @entity2 , at least , tells them that			2
but if you 're looking to try to narrow things down a bit , it makes sense to look at patient , calm , in - form players with solid putting strokes and a mastery of the short game			0
so four names who cover at least most of those bases are : @entity156 , 2011 @entity212 champion @entity212 , @entity213 -- a two - time winner on the @entity215 this season -- and world no. 1 @entity217			0
they may finish as the top four , they may miss the cut			0
it 's not often that picking the top - ranked player is high risk , but then this is the @entity12 at @entity2 .			1

@entity3 's @entity2 has earned a reputation as the graveyard of champions
@entity120 's last 14 majors have been won by 14 different players
@entity94 is bookies ' favorite after recent @entity96 win at @entity97
woods aiming to move to within three wins of @entity101 ' record of 18 majors
