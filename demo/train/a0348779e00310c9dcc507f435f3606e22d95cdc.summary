@entity0 -- the only souvenir that @entity3 has from her stay at a @entity6 located in a vast tourism park alongside the @entity8 is a room key			1
the 52 - year - old said she was not able to buy any of the beach toys in the lobby , walk around a lake nearby , or enjoy the ocean just outside of her window			0
@entity3 was there , she said , because she was forced to be - held in a hotel room for eight days after she and her 56 - year - old husband , @entity18 , traveled to @entity19 in march to protest the compensation they were given for the demolition of the family 's farmhouse to make way for the expansion of @entity0 's @entity27 in 2005			2
when the couple arrived in @entity19 , @entity3 said they were picked up by plain clothes police and forced to travel hundreds of miles back to @entity0 , then held separately at the hotel			2
" i really felt quite sick inside , " said @entity3 , who now lives in a tiny apartment near the airport where her son works as a janitor			0
@entity3 said she tried to escape from her third floor hotel room on march 10 via its balcony but was stopped by at least seven guards who , she said , " put me on the bed and used the bedspread " to hold her down			2
she said she stole the room key when a guard was not looking			0
@entity3 and her husband were not alone			0
three other people have told @entity1 they were held against their will at the @entity52 - located in @entity53 on the outskirts of @entity0 - to keep them from airing grievances to the central government during the 10 - day annual meeting of @entity59 's legislature in march			1
the hotel management and owners deny their claims			2
but people being detained without charge is nothing new in @entity59 , according to @entity66 , which says authorities use hotels , homeless shelters , mental health facilities , farmhouses and obscure government compounds as so - called " black jails " -- unofficial prisons where @entity76 officials hold citizens without charge			1
however activists say this is the first time a facility run by a western company has been allegedly used for these unofficial detentions			1
" i have not come across an @entity88 branded hotel being used as a black jail , " said @entity84 , a senior @entity85 researcher with the @entity86 - based @entity66			2
" that is a first , and it is noteworthy			0
" the @entity92 ( @entity92 ) , the @entity93 - based firm that owns the @entity6 brand , said there was no indication that guests at the hotel were being held against their will last march			1
" we have found no evidence which would confirm these accusations or any sign that the hotel owner knew or cooperated with ( the ) government on this hotel stay and the hotel is operated in accordance with @entity76 [ @entity76 ] local laws and regulations , " @entity92 said in a statement , noting that it had conducted a " thorough investigation " of the allegations			1
" as you 'll appreciate , we ca n't provide details of the booking or guests due to privacy laws			0
" ' black jails ' in @entity59 according to a 2009 @entity66 report on @entity59 's alleged " black jails , " local courts often refuse to take cases from residents who have complaints against local officials , which means petitioning @entity19 is the only option those residents have			1
but their trips to @entity19 present a major problem for local officials , who face demotions or other forms of retribution from higher levels of government based on the number of petitioners who come to @entity19 , according to @entity66			2
as a result , local governments intervene , abducting the petitioners either before they leave or once they arrive in @entity19 , @entity84 said			2
the forced detention of dissidents has become its own cottage industry as public security offices subcontract people to work for them who " are paid per head for each person that they abduct and hold , " @entity84 added			2
" this is a huge grey economy			0
" as @entity152 officials meet this week to decide @entity59 's new leadership , outside will be people like @entity155 and @entity156 who are petitioning government leaders directly for compensation after the demolition of their homes			1
both @entity155 and @entity156 are among the five interviewed by @entity1 who said they attempted to make their case last march , but were intercepted by police who took them into custody and held them in the @entity52			1
human rights groups say detentions without charge are common , particularly during times of central government meetings			1
" we always expect that around significant political events that there will be a tightening of surveillance and control over key individuals who the government considers to be troublemakers , " said @entity175 , director of @entity176 for @entity177			0
" but certainly in the lead up to the transition , there is a growing list of people who are under house arrest			0
" " phenomenal resources are used for keeping tabs on [ petitioners ] , " @entity192 said			0
" detaining them and bringing them back , putting them under surveillance , sending them to reeducation through labor [ camps ]			0
" a spokeswoman for @entity92 said that during the time in question a group of rooms were booked by a government official from the @entity27 district of @entity0			2
that area is home to the five alleged detainees			0
they say their movements are constantly monitored by security officials in their home district after years of appealing for better compensation for their properties			0
according to the five , local officials have either intercepted them before they arrived in @entity19 to make their petitions or tracked them down in the capital and sent them on the 665 - mile journey back to the @entity0 area , where they were held			1
an official at the @entity230 of @entity231 , home of the five petitioners , denied their claims			0
" i do n't know what you are talking about , our channels of petitioning are open , " said the official , who declined to give his name when he was reached by phone			0
" there 's no such thing			0
" @entity1 contacted @entity59 's @entity243 on november 5 for a response to these claims , but there has not yet been a reply			1
however , in the past , @entity19 has denied the existence of so - called " black jails " in @entity59			1
the central government also last year issued new regulations outlawing violent forced eviction and offering new protections , including fair compensation			0
' @entity255 forced evictions ' but rights groups say problems remain			0
" violent forced evictions in @entity59 are on the rise as local authorities seek to offset huge debts by seizing and then selling off land in suspect deals with property developers , " according to an october report by @entity177 , called " @entity268			1
" the 85 - page report also said there is ineffective redress for @entity76 citizens like @entity3 and her husband , who - without cash to hire legal help - petition the central government directly with local grievances that range from allegations of illegal land seizures and forced evictions to corruption and abuse from local authorities			1
they often face weeks or sometimes years of forced detentions without charge , human rights groups say			1
" from our research and research from domestic @entity76 human rights [ groups ] , they are held from a few days to several months and routinely subjected to physical abuse , sleep deprivation and very often they have to buy their way out of custody , " @entity84 said			1
" the government has denied there are any such black jail facilities in @entity59			1
even though [ @entity76 ] state media run stories about black jails , there is an official disconnect			1
" @entity192 at @entity177 said it is hard to quantify the number of people who are detained illegally in @entity59 , but " it is a large phenomenon , " she said			1
" just from the volume of people who put their energies into pursuing petitioning and continue to do so			0
it will be a large problem still			0
" petitioner : kept under guard @entity3 said there were several guards posted outside of her @entity6 room and two women who were living in the room with her whose job was to monitor her			2
she said while held at the hotel , she was told she would be given " classes about petitioner regulations			0
" but there were no classes , she added			0
@entity3 took a reporter to the hotel to show where she was allegedly detained			0
the rooms were neatly furnished , with a flat screen tv and abstract art hanging on the walls			0
when the front desk worker was asked whether they were aware people had allegedly been held against their will in the hotel , the employee said there were a number of guests who were staying in their rooms and were not leaving , and there were people standing outside their room , but that they had no idea why			2
@entity92 said they interviewed all employees at the hotel in june after being first contacted by @entity1 , none of whom confirmed this story			1
a review of hotel security tapes was impossible , the hotel said , because recordings are erased after one month			0
the hotel had the employees sign affidavits attesting to their version of events , a hotel spokeswoman said			0
" @entity92 is committed to operating our company with integrity and we have a @entity372 applicable across the business			2
we have signed up to the @entity375 , aligning our operations and strategies with the ten universal principles that include commitments to human rights and labor standards , " @entity92 said in its statement			1
" our staff is trained to handle different situations and were a situation to arise , our staff would report an incident to the relevant authorities and @entity92			2
" @entity59 has become a leading market for the @entity92 , which owns the @entity6 , @entity92 and @entity390 brands			1
@entity59 led its first half , with a 9.7 % increase in revenue per available rooms			2
@entity92 , headquartered outside @entity395 , generates revenue from 181 hotels in greater @entity59 , with plans to open 160 more hotels , according to the company			1
@entity92 's local partner in the hotel is @entity402 -- a subsidiary of @entity403			1
like most of @entity92 's properties in @entity59 , a local partner legally owns the hotel but @entity92 manages the property			1
@entity408 , a manager with @entity403 , said the company " knows nothing about " people being detained at the @entity6			1
" no violence happened in the hotel , " he said			0
researcher @entity414 contributed to this story			0

five people tell @entity1 they were held against their will at a @entity6 in @entity59
the five were attempting to air grievances at a conference of @entity76 leaders in march
local petition bureau and @entity92 , owner of the @entity6 brand , deny these claims
human rights officials say unofficial detentions in " black jails " are rising in @entity59
