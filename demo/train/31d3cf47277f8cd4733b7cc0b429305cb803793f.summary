-- @entity1 had his @entity2			2
@entity3 has had a little less than a month			2
yet , like @entity1 , he has used bold gestures to alert the world that things in the @entity7 would not be returning to business as usual			1
for @entity7 , images conveyed in a genuine way can be symbols of deeper realities			2
we are a sacramental church			1
@entity14 speaks to us through his word , but that word is often accompanied by ritual , gesture and symbol			2
pope @entity20 really believes in simplicity			1
so far , he has waved off any vestige of opulence ( gold pectoral crosses and ermine lined mantles ) , walks rather than rides in a chauffeured limo , and for now at least refuses to live in the @entity29 ( a complex oxymoron , what apostle ever lived in a palace ? )			2
he chooses to live in a less pretentious guest house			2
he invokes the patron saint of evangelical poverty , @entity36 , but this also comes from his @entity39 formation			2
the vow of poverty and the commitment to the poor is taken seriously among the @entity44 € ” at least the ones i know			2
forming young people to be " men and women for others " is not an idle slogan for a lamppost banner			0
@entity52 really do it and do it well			0
pope @entity20 washes youths ' feet at detention center this may seem to the cynical a mere show or public relations , and a few of those cynics are in the church			1
but something tells me this is the real thing			0
this is how he lived in @entity68			0
he could have had a palace and all the accoutrements of fine living , and yet he chose something elseâ € ” something simple , and closer to the people he wished to serve			0
on thursday , he washed the feet of young juvenile offenders at a detention center in @entity78			0
among them were two women ; one of them was a @entity82			0
let @entity7 around the world take note			0
i can only marvel at this generous and loving gesture			0
but in @entity7 life , rituals are usually accompanied by words			1
sometimes the words are difficult to understand or are prayed in flat and boring tones as though the celebrant does n't believe them			1
but when word and ritual come together in the best way , it can strike fire in human hearts			1
pope @entity20 has uttered some marvelous words to accompany his actions			1
to his frail predecessor , " we are brothers			0
" to the gardeners and janitors of the @entity109 , " if we have a closed heart , we have a heart of stone			0
" to priests , an exhortation to " pray over the realities of the everyday lives " of their parishioners , and " their troubles , their joys , their burdens and their hopes			0
" to the young people at the prison , " help one another			0
this is what @entity125 teaches us			0
this is what i do and i do it with my heart			0
" why did the pope wash prisoners ' feet ? simple , direct words from the heart of a pastorâ € ” words people can and will remember because they are accompanied by actions			1
eventually , the novelty of all this will fade , but the tasks ahead for the @entity7 will not			1
repairing its shattered credibility , especially with the young , will be awaiting @entity20 each morning with his coffee			1
who will advise him ? what kinds of men will he choose as bishops ? how strong will he be in the face of certain opposition within and outside the church ? we will see			2
" @entity20 , rebuild my church , " said the lord to the @entity156 of @entity157			1
pope @entity20 'm sure also hears this same , " small , still , voice			1
" but perhaps we are in for even more surprises			0
the new pontiff has yet to complete the ritual of taking possession of his four basilicas in @entity78			0
these highly ritualized events are accompanied by droves of cardinals and other clerics and offer the pope an occasion to say a few words to mark the occasion			1
opinion : pope @entity20 ' humble superiority it was during one such ceremony in january 1959 , at @entity177 , that pope @entity178 shocked the world by calling for an ecumenical council			1
could @entity20 do the same ? if he did , another @entity1 -- @entity181 -- might say , " bully ! " so would i. the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity184 .			1

@entity184 : pope @entity20 has used bold gestures to *signal* changes to come
@entity189 : @entity20 believes in simplicity and has embodied it in his actions and words
when words and rituals come together well , it can strike fire in human hearts , he says
@entity189 : @entity20 faces many *challenges* ahead , like repairing the church *'s* credibility
