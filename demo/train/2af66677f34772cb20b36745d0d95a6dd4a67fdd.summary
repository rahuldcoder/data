@entity0 -- the opposition @entity2 called monday for urgent military intervention on the part of the international community to help halt the grinding violence and protect civilians			1
the @entity2 , an umbrella group that represents the opposition abroad , also demanded a no - fly zone across @entity10 and a " speedy operation " to arm the @entity12 , a group of fighters made up primarily of defectors from forces loyal to president @entity16			1
" sympathy messages are no longer enough			2
... what is needed is actions on ( the ) ground and decisions and measures against @entity16 's gangs , " the group said in a statement after a meeting in @entity21			1
its demands came as diplomatic efforts to resolve the yearlong @entity10 conflict faltered			0
the @entity31 took up the issue of @entity10 again on monday , with the @entity33 and @entity34 pushing for quick action on a resolution and @entity37 warning against a " take - it - or - leave - it " approach			1
all sides called for an immediate end to the violence even as an opposition group said that dozens of women and children in the city of @entity46 had been stabbed and burned to death over the weekend			1
" there is a growing understanding of the need not to talk to each other on the basis of take - it - or - leave - it , but bring the positions together and be guided not by the desire of revenge , of punishment , who is to blame and so on and so forth , but by the basic interests of the @entity10 people , " @entity37 foreign minister @entity58 told reporters after the @entity31 met			1
" and this requires an immediate end of violence as the number one priority			1
" @entity58 invoked the specter of @entity68 , whose government was overthrown last year after @entity31 resolutions authorizing @entity72 enforcement of a no - fly zone to protect innocent civilians led to widespread bombing of @entity68 military forces			1
he cited reports that members of @entity79 are responsible for fomenting violence in @entity10 and pointed to the @entity12 as also being to blame			1
still , the @entity37 foreign minister described a cease - fire in @entity10 as " an absolute must			1
" he said he hoped weekend meetings between @entity16 and @entity85 " would succeed in developing some ideas which would make it possible for us to agree on how to stop the bloodshed immediately , how to stop the fighting , irrespective of the source of the violence			1
" for others at the meeting , the fount of the violence was not in doubt			1
" the @entity33 believes in the sovereignty and territorial integrity of all member states , but we do not believe that sovereignty offers a grant of immunity when governments massacre their own people , " @entity33 secretary of state @entity98 told reporters			0
she described as " cynical " the @entity10 army 's " fresh assault on @entity110 and continuing its aggression in @entity112 , @entity46 and @entity113 , " even as @entity16 was meeting with @entity85 in @entity115			0
in an acknowledgment that @entity37 and @entity118 last month vetoed a @entity31 resolution that would have condemned @entity16 and called on him to step aside , @entity116 called on " all nations , even those who have previously blocked our efforts , " to speak with one voice in calling for the killings of civilians to end and a transition to democracy to begin			1
@entity128 , @entity0 humanitarian chief , described as " clear deadlock " the situation on @entity10 at the world body			0
" it 's not an ideal situation , " she told @entity1			0
" but we have to keep working on this , we have to keep trying , because there are people who need help			0
" @entity139 said she recently returned from a refugee camp across @entity10 's border with @entity21 , where she spoke with displaced @entity10 " who were very angry about what 's happening in @entity10 and being abandoned by the international community			0
" asked whether @entity85 had left @entity115 empty - handed , @entity34 foreign secretary @entity147 said it was " far too early " to draw that conclusion			1
" he has said that he has made proposals			0
clearly , all concerned will be taking some time , but i hope not much time , to react to those proposals , " he said			0
the @entity0 's @entity155 met monday in @entity156 , @entity157 , to discuss an @entity159 report issued last month			0
the report said @entity10 government officials were responsible for " crimes against humanity " committed by security forces against opposition members			1

children were stabbed to death in front of their mothers , and women and girls were sexually assaulted and then shot , the network said			1
@entity191 , a spokesman for the opposition @entity192 , said the attacks occurred after " @entity10 forces and thugs " stormed homes			2
life and death under @entity10 's military onslaught the @entity179 called the killings a " massacre orchestrated by the regime " of president @entity16			2
another 108 people were killed sunday nationwide , activists said			0
the @entity179 reported monday 's death toll was 44			2
tuesday will be a day of mourning across @entity10 , the @entity179 said			1

" we urge everyone to participate , even if only symbolically , by wearing black ribbons , raising black flags , or wearing black			0
" @entity1 's @entity218 : activists say no optimism for peace after sunset sunday , a live video feed online from opposition activists showed bodies from the @entity46 massacre			2

on monday morning , state - run tv aired a montage of telephone calls reportedly from @entity46			2
the anchor listened to callers denouncing the killings and blaming the @entity178 massacre on what they called anti-government armed gangs			0
the state - run news agency reported that 15 army and law enforcement " martyrs " targeted by armed terrorist groups were buried monday			2
@entity1 can not independently confirm reports of casualties or attacks in @entity10 because the government has severely restricted the access of international journalists			0
but the majority of reports from inside @entity10 indicate the regime is slaughtering civilians to wipe out dissidents seeking @entity16 's ouster			0
the @entity282 has ruled @entity10 for more than four decades			0
