-- facing the world after an isolating and traumatic experience is often stressful , especially for those who have been away for a long time			0
@entity4 is reuniting with her close relatives for the first time in 18 years , after having been found on august 27			1
@entity8 was 11 years old when she was abducted in 1991 from a bus stop in @entity10 , @entity11			2
she allegedly was kept in a series of backyard sheds by a convicted sex offender and gave birth to two children in captivity			0
a bail review hearing is scheduled for monday in @entity19 in @entity20 , @entity11 , for @entity21 and @entity4 , who face charges related to @entity8 's kidnapping			1
in @entity26 , @entity25 is charged with child abduction , allegedly having forced 6 - year - old @entity28 to live in seclusion and be hidden , at times in crawl spaces and the attic , for nearly two years , according to court documents			1
in concealing the boy , @entity25 violated the terms of a court order that granted joint custody of the child to @entity40 , the documents said			0
the boy is staying with his father 's family under child welfare supervision , according to @entity0 affiliate @entity45			1
the situations of @entity8 and @entity47 are extreme cases of people emerging from isolation and returning to the real world			2
the people who have been away often feel conflicted about leaving the situation they 've acclimated to in order to rejoin the loved ones they 've left behind , experts not connected to the cases tell @entity0			1
photos : missing children who were found sometimes children involved in custody disputes are taught to hate their father or mother , and " extreme tactics " may be used , although usually not to the extent of hiding a child in crawl spaces , said @entity68 , psychologist at @entity69 at @entity70			2
" while this case is obviously the rarest of things , other children are certainly exposed to many traumas that have meaning connected to this , " @entity68 said			0
the case of @entity8 @entity8 is spending time in " a secluded place , reconnecting " with her mother and younger sister , said her aunt , @entity8 , in a statement on behalf of her family			2
" this is a joyful time for my family , " she said			2
" @entity86 remembers all of us			0
" but a person in @entity8 's situation would most likely have both positive and negative feelings about leaving the only environment she 's known for 18 years and coming back to her family , psychologists say			1
" she 's going to have a lot of mixed feelings about returning to her family of origin because she 's spent almost two decades with a different family , " said @entity93 , a child and family psychologist in @entity95 , @entity11			1
after allegedly being confined for 18 years , @entity8 probably would find the outside world frightening , @entity68 said			1
" you get to know this world you live in -- it may be a terrible world , but it 's the world you know , " he said			2
experts say @entity8 may have developed what is known as @entity109 , in which kidnapping victims identify with their captors			0
learning to live with and even like the perpetrator has survival value , @entity93 said , and also explains why someone like @entity8 probably would feel somewhat torn about returning to her original family			1
" it 's a concept that explains why a kidnapped victim would stay with a perpetrator even though they had an opportunity to leave , " she said			2
" they opt to stay because it 's their comfort zone			2
" but @entity125 , a psychologist in @entity126 , @entity26 , said @entity8 's readjustment will depend on how she was treated in captivity			0
police said @entity4 , one of her alleged abductors , is believed to be the father of her two daughters , and his relationship to @entity8 -- whether he framed their alleged sexual encounters as violent or seductive -- will influence her feelings about leaving that situation , @entity125 said			1
it is also important to know how @entity8 felt about her family before she was taken away , @entity125 said			1
" did she secretly mourn them ? " @entity125 asked			0
" did she feel she stepped on a different planet where she was all of a sudden a grown - up 11 - year - old and was n't being treated anymore like a child ? " her family members may have constantly wondered what they could have done differently to prevent the kidnapping , @entity125 said			1
at the same time , someone in @entity8 's situation may have asked herself at the outset , " why did they let me get kidnapped ? " @entity68 said			0
there is an infinite range of responses , but more information about @entity8 's feelings growing up and in captivity would inform how she adjusts to her new life , @entity125 said			0
the situation is likely also difficult for @entity8 's two daughters , born to her in captivity , who have never met @entity8 's family before , @entity93 said			1
" it 's basically like a wild child who may have had some contact with civilization , but basically is having to start life all over again , and that may be overwhelming to them at first , " she said			0
@entity93 said she would suggest to a family like @entity8 's to be accepting and supportive , and not ask a lot of questions			1
" go about your daily life as usual for the most part , and take the lead from the therapist , one small step at a time , " she said			0
@entity68 advises them against looking for some sudden moment of reconnection , but rather to be loving and patient			0
coming back from combat @entity8 's reuniting with her family could also be likened to a soldier coming back from a " hellacious war , " @entity68 said			1
a recent survey of military spouses of deployed @entity190 soldiers with school - age children found that the return from deployment is the most stressful , according to three - quarters of respondents			1
reunification brings excitement and relief , which is sometimes accompanied by emotional conflict , the surveyors said			0
read more about the study in the military , bonds of brotherhood form as people face dangers together , @entity125 said			0
when service members come home , they may find life " shallower , " and feel that they are not the same people as when they left , she said			2
in a case where a husband has been away at war and returns to his wife , the desire to understand one another 's feelings is fundamental , she said			0
" she wants to be understanding , he wants to be able to shove it aside , then he has nightmares , and she says , ' you 're not setting it aside , ' " @entity125 said			0
" well , consciously he is -- he 's not awake when he dreams			0
" do n't force the person who has been away to talk about their experiences , @entity93 said			1
she also stressed that a family should try to normalize the life of the service member who has returned from war			0
waking up in the morning , going grocery shopping , washing clothes and doing other day - to - day activities help create a stable , comforting environment , she said .			1
