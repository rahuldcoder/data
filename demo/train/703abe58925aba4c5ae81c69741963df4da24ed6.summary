from the moment we cross the @entity3 border into @entity4 , evidence of the @entity6 in @entity7 and @entity4 's draconian and brutal rule lingers			1
more than a month after the group was driven from the town of @entity13 , residents here drive through the streets , pointing out where @entity16 fighters carried out executions and left bodies to rot for all to see			1
" that 's where they had one of their checkpoints , " says rebel fighter @entity20 , pointing to a small concrete building on the side of the road as we speed past			1
@entity16 arrived in @entity13 about a year ago , initially welcomed in the conservative town by @entity33 fighters			1
but within a few months , @entity16 had entrenched itself and begun exerting its harsh order through what one fighter calls " terrorism and punishment			1
" " @entity16 came in and took over one area and announced it was an @entity41 state and did whatever they wanted , " @entity20 says			1
in the passenger 's seat , fellow fighter @entity44 sighs , his @entity47 trained out the window			2
" they used to leave the bodies of people they executed at the checkpoint for days , " he says			0
" the corpses would rot			0
no one could avoid looking at them			0
" amid the civil war in @entity4 , another war is taking place -- one that pits moderate and @entity33 rebels against radicals from @entity16 , a group so radical that even @entity63 has reportedly distanced itself from it			1
both groups of fighters are opposed to the government of @entity4 president @entity67			1
for months , reports have been emerging from northern @entity4 about @entity16 atrocities			1
in @entity13 , bullet holes riddle the walls at a former @entity16 prison			1
most of them are at the same level -- the average height of a man			0
" those are mostly from the executions , " says @entity78 , another fighter			2
" others are from the battle			0
" at the town 's courthouse , a fresh coat of white paint covers the black mark left by @entity16 -- known to paint buildings black as they take over @entity4 towns			1
executions would take place out front			1
in the back , freshly dug dirt marks where some of the bodies were buried in mass graves			2
@entity78 points to a pile of burning trash			0
@entity16 beheaded one of the top rebel commanders -- placing his head in that very spot -- in broad daylight when the market was packed with people as a warning : anyone who dared oppose them would have the same fate			1
in early january , rebel groups banded together and launched an offensive against @entity16 in @entity13 and other areas in northern @entity4			1
" we had to leave the fronts with the regime , " @entity78 says , " and fall back to fight @entity16 and liberate the already liberated areas			2
" still , many in @entity13 are too afraid to speak openly			2
so deep is their fear , they do n't even want to be seen with us			0
next to the former prison , a family waits , hoping for closure			0
volunteers shovel dirt from a grave they dug up before			0
@entity123 filmed at the time shows four contorted corpses			0
it 's among many mass graves rebel fighters have unearthed			1
" we found a foot , a shoe , and a jacket , " @entity13 resident @entity129 tells us			2
her neighbor @entity135 joins us			0
his two younger brothers are missing , he says			0
" it 's my brother 's jacket			2
he just went out to get sugar and tomatoes			0
" a man drops a pile of children 's socks , covered in dirt , on the ground			2
" his wife wanted socks for their kids , " @entity135 says , still disbelieving			0
the day after we meet @entity135 , the bodies are dug up			0
it 's three of his brothers who were killed by @entity16			1
he had thought one of them was in jail			0
he crouches on the ground , covering his face , shoulders shaking as he sobs .			0
