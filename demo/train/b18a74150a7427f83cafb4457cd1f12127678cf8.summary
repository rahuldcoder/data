@entity0 -- the @entity2 signaled its support on monday for a bipartisan measure strengthening border security in the comprehensive " @entity11 " immigration reform bill , a sweeping blueprint that promises to overhaul @entity9 's immigration policies for the first time since 1986			1
the 67 - to - 27 vote was considered a key test of support for the bill as a whole , as the measure also includes language echoing most other parts of the legislation			1
the @entity2 kept the vote open for a significant amount of time for lawmakers who experienced travel delays due to bad weather in @entity0			1
some senators did not make it in time			0
supporters needed at least 60 votes to move forward with the revised border security provisions , which were drafted partly to boost @entity33 support for the overall package			1
backers of the bill were hoping to win about 70 votes to demonstrate growing bipartisan momentum for the larger proposal as it nears final passage in the @entity41 - controlled @entity2 and heads to the @entity33 - controlled @entity42			1
@entity2 leaders are currently on track to hold a final vote on the bill itself before @entity47 breaks for its july 4 recess at the end of the week			1
if enacted , the bill would create a path to citizenship for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants			2
" when the immigration bill passes , ( @entity33 speaker @entity56 ) should bring it up for a vote in the @entity42 quickly , " said senate majority leader @entity54 , @entity55			1
" mr. speaker , rather than twisting the arms of tea party extremists , just work with moderates from both parties to pass bipartisan legislation			0
" @entity67 @entity33 sen. @entity66 , a strong opponent of the bill , condemned " republicans eager to go along with the @entity41 in a mad rush to pass this bill			2
" " what is the rush ? " he asked , noting that the legislative language for the changes was released last friday			0
" why are we proceeding gangbusters ? " the @entity77 welcomed the vote			2
" we are pleased the @entity2 continues to work together on commonsense immigration reform , " @entity77 spokesman @entity79 said			1
" as the president said today , this is a strong bipartisan bill that meets his principles , and now is the time to get it done			0
" among other things , the border security amendment would require 20,000 more border agents , complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with @entity91 , and deploy $ 3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by @entity9 forces in @entity95 and @entity96			1
the proposal also includes stronger worker eligibility verification standards and border entry - exit controls			1
most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after the five conditions have been met and verified by the @entity103			0
@entity33 sens. @entity104 of @entity105 and @entity106 of @entity107 introduced the compromise amendment last week , saying it incorporated proposals from other senators to try to fix a broken immigration system			0
the staunchest critics of the plan produced by the bipartisan " @entity11 " senators , however , have remained skeptical			1
sen. @entity116 , @entity117 , said last week that the compromise means " amnesty will occur , " and argued that the @entity104 - @entity106 amendment was only drafted in reaction to revelations about shortcomings in the original bill			2
sen. @entity125 , @entity126 , announced monday that he would oppose the @entity128 changes , declaring that he " can not support an amendment cobbled together at the eleventh hour that doubles the border patrol without knowing how much it will cost or whether it is even the right strategy			2
" " unfortunately this measure still omits a real trigger or objective measure to see if the proposed strategy is working , " he added			0
" at a time when the trust deficit with the federal government is so huge , we do not need more promises from the government - we need measurable results			0
" last week , the @entity2 rejected a measure drafted by @entity125 that would have required much stricter border security standards			1
@entity41 warned that his proposal was a " poison pill " that would have ensured defeat for the entire plan			0
@entity152 sen. @entity151 , the most prominent @entity33 in the " @entity11 , " told @entity1 's @entity153 last week that he understands " why conservatives are upset			2
" " they 've seen all these promises in the past that have n't been delivered , " @entity151 said			0
but the status quo on immigration " is hurting @entity9 , " he added			0
" and if nothing passes , then this disaster that we have now , that 's what 's going to stay in place			0
" @entity1 's @entity166 , @entity153 , and @entity167 contributed to this report			0
