-- from the first moment i spoke with @entity4 , it was obvious that the former solicitor general for @entity6 had a bright future in politics			1
my first interview with @entity4 , at the @entity10 in 2010 , came less than a month after @entity11 passed the @entity12			2
@entity4 , who was not quite 40 at the time and still contemplating his political future , already had the @entity12 firmly in his sights			1
" we are facing from @entity17 the greatest threat to our liberty we have ever seen , " he said , " i think we have to fight on every front to repeal @entity12			0
" @entity4 did n't want to shy away from a court fight , but predicted that conservatives would have to win with voters more than judges to succeed			2
less than a year later , @entity4 would throw his hat in the ring to succeed @entity27 in the @entity28 and continue his fight from @entity17 rather than @entity6			2
after only seven months in town , @entity4 's political talents are obvious			2
his drive to push the @entity33 into a budget showdown over @entity12 reflects his passionate opposition to the @entity12 and a shrewd assessment of the temperature of the grassroots base			0
he 's also a staunch opponent of the @entity40 immigration reform bill , a position based first on his principles but clearly consonant with many rank - and - file @entity33			2
the immigration bill pitted him against another talented @entity33 newcomer , sen. @entity45 of @entity46 , one of its authors and vocal proponents , although both are allied on the strategy to overturn @entity12			1
@entity4 's rapid ascent has rallied conservative activists and has many speculating over his potential impact on the 2016 presidential race			1
in fact , enough people are speculating on it that @entity59 and @entity60 have been moved to cast doubts on his eligibility to run			0
( @entity4 was born in @entity63 , but his mother is a native of @entity65 and a @entity67 citizen , which would qualify @entity4 as native - born under the broadly accepted definition of the term			0
) opinion : @entity4 can be president , probably @entity4 has recently begun to tour @entity73 , usually a good signal of presidential ambition , while @entity76 reported this week that social conservatives in the state are pushing to get @entity4 into the 2016 race			2
no one doubts that @entity4 has a bright future in the @entity33 , but that does n't mean the future is now			1
@entity4 , like @entity45 and @entity84 , have only barely arrived on the national stage and are many years younger than their sell - by date			1
none of the three has held executive office yet			0
both @entity84 and @entity4 have only won one election in their career			1
all three have made an extraordinary impact as freshmen senators , but they are still mainly untested outside of a single electoral cycle			0
additionally , @entity33 have more options : by the time 2015 rolls around and candidates have to commit to a run , a number of @entity33 governors will be staking out their ground as well			1
@entity105 gov. @entity104 will almost certainly use his considerable media presence and blunt style to launch the next phase of his career			0
@entity110 has to win a re-election bid in @entity112 in 2014 ; a win will re-establish his fighting credentials on budgets and reform			0
@entity117 got some attention early in the 2012 cycle as a potential presidential contender , but decided to go home to @entity122 to add executive office to his already - impressive conservative credentials			0
@entity125 , who like @entity4 was given a featured - speaker slot at the national @entity33 convention last year , should sail to a 2014 re-election in @entity129 , with approval ratings that have never dropped below 60 %			1
this wealth of proven executive talent , most from governors who have courted the conservative grassroots , makes the @entity136 bids from freshmen senators look even more like long shots			0
that 's not to say that we may not see a president @entity4 in the future			1
with his talent and political savvy and his potential for staying power , no one should count him out in the long run			0
like @entity84 and @entity45 , though , his potential presidential future may be 2020 or 2024			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity151 .			0

@entity151 : @entity4 has bright future with @entity33 , some say he 's mulling presidential run
he says that would be great -- in perhaps 2020 ; same with young comers @entity84 , @entity45
he says there are far more seasoned possible candidates in @entity33 governor ranks
@entity151 : @entity84 , @entity4 , @entity45 could well be presidents , but should wait till 2020 , 2024
