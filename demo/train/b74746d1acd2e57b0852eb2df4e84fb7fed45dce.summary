-- @entity1 needs to do more to implement safeguards that would control a fertilizer that is being used in explosive devices in @entity5 , according to an @entity7 lawmaker who recently visited the country			1
" basically what we 're waiting for is for the @entity1 government to implement the strategy that they 've said they 're going to implement when we were in @entity1 in august , meeting with all the highest - level officials , " said sen. @entity9 , @entity10			1
" unfortunately we 're into october now , and i have n't seen any action in the month of september			0
" he said the strategy should include restricting who has access to the fertilizer ; tracking it , perhaps with the use of dye ; and interdicting it at the border with @entity5			1
according to the @entity7 military 's @entity27 , 84 % of improvised explosive devices in @entity5 are made from fertilizer produced in @entity1 , and ieds are the @entity32 killer of @entity7 forces in @entity5 , responsible for more than 400 deaths in the past two years			1
but a @entity1 official disputed @entity9 's criticism , saying authorities are moving as fast as they can on the problem , and that it has to be a joint effort on both sides of the border			1
the official , who declined to be identified , also said that out of the tons of the fertilizer produced , it is difficult to track down the small amounts placed into @entity30			2
the fertilizer , calcium ammonium nitrate , is processed into small off - white pellets and is shipped in huge sacks			0
the same ingredient was used by @entity53 in the @entity55 bombing in 1995			0
while it has been banned in @entity5 since 2009 , it is legally produced in @entity1 and is widely used there for farming			2
calcium ammonium nitrate is " suitable for all crops , all seasons , soils and locations , " according to manufacturer @entity59 , whose website says they are the only firm in @entity1 that produces it			2
a year ago , @entity68 said they stopped a convoy in which three of the trucks were smuggling 50 tons of the fertilizer -- enough to make more than 2,100 ieds , they said			0
" it 's an extremely porous border , " said @entity73 at the @entity74 , who was in @entity5 last month			1
" there 's not enough time in a day , with a long line of vehicles , to stop every single vehicle and check it			0
" @entity73 said militants in @entity5 are managing to smuggle ied ingredients up the @entity83 to make roadside bombs targeting @entity7 @entity85 operating in southern @entity5 , as well as through areas like the @entity87 to target @entity89 forces in the east			2
the @entity7 pressure on @entity1 to act comes at a time when cooperation between the two countries is already under heavy strain -- most recently , after the outgoing chairman of the @entity92 , adm. @entity93 , said the militant @entity102 " acts as a veritable arm of @entity1 's @entity101			1
" @entity1 officials have vigorously denied the accusation			0
but @entity9 said that he would not be put off , as long as @entity7 soldiers are being injured and killed			1
" go to @entity106 , and see those 19 - year - old kids with half of their leg blown off -- or in many instances , having died this way , " he said			0
" that 's just inexcusable , when we have the resources , the technology , and the know - how , to slow this down or to stop it in some way			0

@entity1 needs to put safeguards in place , says @entity7 sen. @entity9
