-- clouds intrigued me as a boy			1
i was curious about what they were made of , how they got up in the sky and what it would be like to sit on one			2
i also thought they looked beautiful			0
kids are often entranced by clouds			1
unfortunately , such positive feelings rarely endure into adulthood			0
as we grow up , we start to moan about clouds			1
we consider them as metaphors for doom and gloom , describing someone who 's depressed as " having a cloud hanging over them " and bad news in store as " a cloud on the horizon			1
" watch @entity29 's @entity28 clouds get a bad press			1
that 's why , a few years ago , i started the @entity34			0
it exists to remind people that , far from being things to complain about , clouds are among of the most diverse , evocative , and poetic parts of nature			1
@entity28 : sculpting waves in wood and time it must be because they are so commonplace , so ubiquitous , so everyday , that we become blind to the beauty of clouds			2
we only tend to notice them when they block out the sun. so they come to represent the annoying obstructions in life , the things that get in the way			0
our feelings about the weather are often articulated as if there is a battle between the sun and the clouds -- between good weather and cloudy weather			2
such an opposition is , of course , just projection			0
the sun 's energy powers the very movement of air around our atmosphere that causes clouds to form			2
" the most beautiful thing in @entity77 , " wrote @entity75 , " is the sun reflected from a tearful cloud			0
" @entity28 : @entity80 on anti-gravity sculpture not only should we appreciate clouds more , we also need to understand them better			2
the recent fifth report of the @entity86 includes one conclusion that all sides of the climate change debate can agree on			1
this is that the one factor contributing the greatest uncertainty in scientists ' attempts to predict future global temperatures is the clouds			1
they have a huge and complex effect on the flow of energy to and from our planet , sometimes reflecting away the sun 's heat , sometimes trapping in @entity105 's warmth			0
scientists still do n't understand enough about the formation of clouds to predict with confidence how cloud cover will be affected by changing atmospheric conditions			1
without knowing that , they can neither be sure how the clouds will amplify future changes in global temperatures and nor make confident predictions about our climate in decades to come			1
but on the ground , in the meantime , the pleasures of cloudspotting , are all about the here and now			2
there is a satisfaction in learning to recognize the different types of cloud , from the fair - weather cumulus to the high , wispy cirrus , the fierce cumulonimbus storm cloud and the many other rare , unusual and fleeting cloud forms			0
@entity28 : nature , beauty , gratitude finding shapes in the clouds is an aimless , carefree pastime that we adults should also do more of			1
the digital age conspires to make us feel busier than ever			2
@entity142 , by contrast , is an activity that legitimizes doing nothing			0
these days , we need excuses to do nothing			0
happiness comes not from a desperate search for stimulation elsewhere but from finding what is intriguing , surprising and " exotic " in the everyday stuff around us			0
you do n't need to cross the world to be amazed			0
you just need to step outside and look up , every now and then , as if you are seeing the sky for the first time			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity29 .			1

@entity29 : clouds entrance kids , but for adults are often metaphors for gloom
but he says they are one of the most diverse , evocative , poetic parts of nature .
he says scientists puzzled by what clouds can tell about predicting future climate change
@entity29 : in *frenzied* age , cloudspotting legitimately , *blissfully* allows us to do nothing
