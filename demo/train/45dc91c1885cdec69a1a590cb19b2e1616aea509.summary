i hate the term " age appropriate			2
" at 53 i will dress as i like , thank you			0
so , please , fashion mags , clothing stores and @entity7 , stop with the " how to dress in your 20s , 30s , 40s and beyond " nonsense			0
@entity12 is the latest to inform me , that at my advanced age , short shorts are not for me			1
( and i thought legs were the last to go			0
i shop there all the time precisely because they sell clothes i want to wear			1
now i have to shop there knowing i dare not go near certain clothes because , well , this is how a very attractive , older @entity12 lady put it : " in my 20 's , i wore rollneck sweaters with short shorts			1
a lot has changed since then			0
some 20 - plus years later , i still love @entity12 , just ... differently			1
but , then again , @entity12 is n't alone when it comes to schooling older ladies on what they should or should n't bare			1
@entity30 , way back in 2010 , helpfully pointed out " women of a certain age " should never wear mini-skirts with @entity32 , never expose their stomach , never , never wear tube tops , absolutely no shredded denim and , for goodness sakes , no neon nail polish because " as you age , skin gets more sallow			1
" thanks @entity42 ! guess i 'll cross uggs off the list ! i am still a tad confused , though , by a @entity45 spread a few months back that featured " sexy grandmas ! " ( yes , there was an exclamation point ! ) it featured a 68 - year - old @entity51 exposing her cleavage			2
does that mean i can expose my grandchildren to my two best friends , but not my thighs ? perhaps this trend started with the best of intentions			0
but after having total strangers instruct me through the years to dress sexy , not slutty , in my 20s , to avoid mom - jeans in my 30s , to find a " signature look " in my 40s and to throw out my uggs in my 50s -- i am done ! and while i 'm at it , i 'm done with the " she looks great -- and holy sh -- , she 's 45 ! " @entity70 is 45 , but she looked beautiful at the @entity71 sunday night ... period			1
and , guess what ? her gown , with the deep , plunging neckline was awesomely appropriate even if it would never be included in the " beyond " category			0
recently i had a conversation with a young male friend who was lambasting a " nearly 60 - year - old " @entity80 for exposing her bare rear end at the @entity82			1
" do n't worry , " i said			2
" that was n't for you			2
" @entity80 was simply doing what she 's always done -- sending a message to women that it 's okay to express your sexuality			1
i do n't think i convinced him			0
but , that 's okay			0
i have my own opinions			0
and that includes looking in the mirror and thinking , damn , i look great in these short shorts .			0

@entity97 : @entity12 ad advises older women to wear ' age - appropriate ' clothes . spare me
she says stars like @entity70 , @entity80 do n't *apologize* for dressing how they want and the look great
she says she 's through with having total strangers tell her what 's ok for a woman of her age to wear
