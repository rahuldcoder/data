-- the picture says it all			0
@entity3 was thrilled to receive a @entity5 poster for his 14th birthday in 1976			1
the shot of 14 - year - old @entity3 shows him unrolling one of his birthday treasures in 1976 , mouth slightly agape and eyes intensely focused on the gift			0
the present was one he had fervently requested from his parents and a hot item for many a young , red - blooded male during that bicentennial year : a poster of @entity5 ( then known as @entity5 )			1
" i was a huge @entity5 fan , " said @entity3 , now a cartoonist and entrepreneur living in @entity21 , @entity22			2
" i had started collecting all of the magazines and pictures and i was basically pinning up every picture that came out of every magazine			0
then along came that poster			0
" " that poster " reportedly became the best - selling of all time -- with more than 12 million copies sold -- and helped make @entity5 one of the last great pinups			1
a private funeral is scheduled tuesday at the @entity34 in downtown @entity35 , @entity36 , for the actress who died at the age of 62 from cancer			0
with her famously thick blond hair , red swimsuit , and smile as big and bright as the @entity36 sun , the actress was the epitome of the wholesome , @entity45			0
" she was full of life and so happy with that blond hair and that huge smile , " said @entity3 , who is n't sure if he still has the poster in his attic			0
" without that poster , i do n't think she would have become what she was			0

@entity59 , the author of " @entity60 : @entity61 , @entity62 , @entity63 , " said pinups " straddled the line between portraiture and pornography " and included early stage actresses , the famed models of @entity70 and the most famous pinup of all , @entity72			0
@entity5 has her place in pinup history , said @entity59 , an assistant professor of art history at @entity76 , @entity77			1
" the @entity5 poster really is one of the last iconic pinup images of the 20th century , " @entity59 said			1
" by the 1970s , because of the sexual revolution and mores about sexuality becoming looser in the west , the pinup does start to become more nostalgic			0
" when the photo was taken , @entity5 had not yet become one of " @entity88 , " the role which helped make her a star			2
she was instead better known for her commercials and ads , most notably -- and not surprisingly -- for @entity95 shampoo			0

" she had no idea of how beautiful and how attractive she was , i 'm sure , " @entity96 recalled			2
" she was just like apple - pie , girl - next - door kind of girl , and in all the years i knew her she never changed			0
" now @entity5 's image , which was considered racy at the time , is a huge part of nostalgia			1
@entity112 , a manager of @entity113 and @entity114 in @entity35 , said that before @entity5 's death , the poster was most in demand from production companies looking to stage the 1970s			1
" that poster , that shot of her , is just one of the definitive images of that time , " @entity112 said			1
" most of the time with the posters , the teen girls are driving the market , and @entity5 is probably one of the last ones that was for the guys			1
" @entity112 said actresses today , with the exception of a few like @entity132 , do n't really opt to market themselves using posters anymore			0

@entity5 had the crossover appeal that went beyond just being a model , @entity137 said			2
