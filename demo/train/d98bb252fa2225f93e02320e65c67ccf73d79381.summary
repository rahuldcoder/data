a @entity1 teen who 's been jailed more than four months for a @entity3 comment he made during a video - game argument is finally getting a day in court that could let him go home			1
@entity7 , who was 18 when he was arrested , will appear in @entity8 ( @entity1 ) @entity9 on tuesday , july 16 , for a bond hearing , according to his lawyer , @entity11			1
@entity11 told @entity12 he will argue to have @entity7 's $ 500,000 bond , which his family can not afford to cover , reduced			1
@entity11 , who is working the case for free , met with @entity7 for the first time on tuesday			1
he said @entity7 is not doing well , and his family says he has been placed on suicide watch			1
" @entity7 is in bad shape and has suffered quite a bit of abuse while in jail , " @entity11 said in an e-mail			1
" we will likely bring out these issues at the bond hearing			1
" he did not elaborate on the type of abuse claimed by @entity7 , who is now 19			1
in february , @entity7 and a friend were arguing on @entity3 with someone else over the online video game " @entity30			1
" his father told @entity12 that the other gamer called @entity33 and his son responded with sarcasm			0
according to court documents , @entity7 wrote , " i 'm f * * * ed in the head alright			1
i think @entity38 ( sic ) shoot up a kindergarten and watch the blood of the innocent rain down and eat the beating heart of one of them			0
" @entity45 said his son followed the claim with " lol " and " @entity49 " -- indicating that the comment was n't serious			0
authorities say someone reported the comment -- which came about two months after the killings at @entity55 in @entity56 -- and @entity7 was arrested february 21 on a charge of making terroristic threats			1
in @entity1 , that 's a felony that carries a sentence of up to eight years in prison			1
police originally thought @entity7 lived with his father in @entity63 , @entity1 , at a home the arrest report says is 100 yards from a school			2
they later learned he was living in @entity68 , between @entity63 and @entity69			0
the @entity70 declined to provide @entity12 with additional documents related to the case			0
the @entity8 district attorney 's office , which is prosecuting the case , did not immediately respond to a request for comment			2
@entity7 's case has stirred support online			2
a change.org petition by his mother , calling for his release , had received more than 43,000 digital signatures as of wednesday morning			0
" @entity7 's a good kid , " @entity84 wrote on the petition			2
" he would n't hurt anyone , let alone a child			0
" she wrote that he has been " assaulted a number of times " in jail and that no weapons were found during a search of his home			0
the @entity93 tells @entity12 it is monitoring the case			0
" we are all concerned about safety in our schools , but that 's not what is at issue here , " said @entity95 , legal and policy director for the @entity93 of @entity1			0
" @entity102 protects a person 's speech -- even speech that is in poor taste -- as long as it is not a true threat			0
" @entity7 's online comment might have been distasteful and thoughtless			2
but , if the facts as reported are true , his comment is an objectionable joke rather than an actual threat , in which case the @entity8 district attorney is prosecuting protected speech			2
that 's a dangerous precedent			0
