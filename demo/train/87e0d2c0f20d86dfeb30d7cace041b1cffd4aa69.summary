-- sure , there are things at stake in tuesday 's recall election for governor of @entity6			1
you need to know only a smidgeon about the politics of @entity10 gov. @entity10 and the @entity12 challenger @entity13 mayor @entity11 to be aware of that			1
you need to have paid only passing attention to the political battle that has engulfed @entity6 for 16 months to know that			1
if there 's anything that just about everyone in @entity6 agrees on , it 's that it makes a big difference who is governor and which party controls each house of the legislature			1
when staunch conservative @entity10 and @entity28 swept to control of the @entity29 in @entity30 , and particularly when @entity10 launched his drive in february 2011 to render public employee unions all but powerless , no doubt was left that it mattered when @entity10 beat the liberal - to - moderate @entity11 by a 52.3 % to 46.5 % margin in november 2010			1
@entity10 's fate in @entity6 comes down to ground game the changes can be seen not only in the law on employee public unions , but in tax policies , school funding , the strength of the safety net for those in need , environmental regulations , the right to carry concealed weapons and other major issues			1
but some things are not going to change in the light of tuesday 's outcome , things that should be kept in mind when it comes to post-election analysis			0
i 'd suggest five of them : 1			0
the presidential race in @entity6			1
many will read tuesday 's outcome as a good sign for the presidential candidate from the party of the winner			2
for one thing , president @entity65 has done fairly well in recent polls , up 8 percentage points over former gov. @entity69 in a @entity70 last week , while @entity11 has trailed @entity10 in almost all recent polls , down 7 percentage points in the same poll			1
clearly , some people look at the two races separately			0
previously on @entity0 : my mom is sick of calls from @entity69 @entity65 and the @entity78 have distanced themselves from the recall election			1
that was glaringly clear when @entity65 did not make an appearance in @entity6 , even though he was in next - door @entity83 on friday and then , friday night and saturday , in his hometown of @entity85			2
it 's a short hop from @entity85 to @entity87 , @entity88 or @entity13 , all @entity12 strongholds where turnout will be key on tuesday			0
the most reasonable interpretation for national @entity12 keeping their distance is that they see nothing to gain from being visible , especially given polls that suggest a @entity11 defeat is likely			0
the thinking most likely is : if @entity65 is doing reasonably well in @entity6 already , why get involved in this acrimonious and probably losing mess ? @entity6 @entity12 leaders have been unhappy with the low level of national party support , but @entity28 have been more forthcoming with both money and by sending in @entity28 stars such as @entity105			1
@entity106 , @entity107 and @entity108			0
however the recall turns out , leaders of both parties expect the presidential race to be close in @entity6			1
with 10 electoral votes , @entity6 is n't a big deal , except that it is hard to chart an @entity65 victory without including @entity6			2
in 2000 and 2004 , the state had razor 's edge wins for @entity12			2
the 2008 outcome , an easy @entity65 win , was different			0
but in some ways , 2008 seems longer ago than 2004			0
the deep well of political anger			0
@entity6 is a strong example of how people are pretty fed up , even as they go in almost equal numbers in opposite political directions			2
the economy , social hot - button issues , cultural issues , economic and racial dynamics -- there are many sources of fuel for the feelings that divide @entity6			2
the demographics of the state make these close to 50 - 50 issues , but it 's worth pondering how similar the intensity of emotions are on each side of the divide			2
that anger wo n't be relieved after tuesday			0
@entity6 is in the era of @entity148			2
in addition to the regularly scheduled november elections for governor and legislative seats , the state has featured a super-close , high spending @entity155 race in 2011 and waves of recall elections for state senators			1
immediately after tuesday 's recall for governor comes a hot @entity28 primary in august for an open @entity164 seat , followed by the november election , which will include not only the presidential and @entity164 voting but elections for half the @entity169 and all of the @entity170			1
the dominance of big money			0
the political wars here have been a remarkable boon to television station revenues			0
tens of millions of dollars have been spent on the recall election , much of it coming from out - of - state donors			1
it 's not just tv and radio			0
it 's daily mailings to hundreds of thousands of homes , extensive phone banking and robo - calling , and expensive get - out - the - vote efforts , which may prove be the decisive factor			0
the invasion of big money wo n't end after the recall , given the upcoming elections			1
the short supply of civility			0
with some exceptions -- the era of sen. @entity198 in the 1950s comes to mind -- @entity6 has been known for civil politics			1
but the polarization of the state has been evident in round after round of polling , just as it is clear to anyone who observes the tenor of campaigning			0
there is little reason to think the intense and adamant approach to politics will abate after tuesday			0
the pendulum swings in @entity6 politics , and it seems to being swinging faster and farther in recent years			1
both the winners and losers tuesday are almost sure to refuel for more fights ahead , not only at the polls			1
the next two - year state budget cycle begins in early 2013			2
it will be intense , whoever wins			0
hostility is going to hang around , and there 's a strong chance political disarray will continue to be its partner			0
the state song is " on , @entity6			1
" whatever happens tuesday , the case is likely to get stronger for making it @entity230 's " @entity229			0
" the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity233 .			2

@entity233 : @entity10 , who *weakened* public worker unions , changed the politics of @entity6
