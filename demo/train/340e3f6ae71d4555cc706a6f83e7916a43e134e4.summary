-- the first thing @entity2 says when i drag my stressed self into the chill lobby of the @entity6 , her @entity8 - chic hotel in @entity9 : " oh , dear			1
" the mood is mod and the art is amazing			0
and you do n't even need a car to enjoy it			0
the second thing she says : " i think someone needs a @entity18			0
i 've just suffered through two - plus hours of @entity21 gridlock so that i can unwind in the desert , and i plan to ditch my car for the weekend ( if not , alas , forever )			1
which is why i 've come to @entity9			1
not only does it do the whole midcentury modern thing perfectly , but of all @entity28 's desert resorts , it 's also probably the most pedestrian - and bike - friendly			1
@entity29 : top 10 dream towns the @entity6 is just a three - minute walk to the glittery shopping and dining street @entity34 , and a short bike ride away from everything else i 'm interested in checking out this weekend			2
that includes galleries , a recently unveiled collection of @entity28 landscape paintings at the @entity42 , and the new @entity43 ( named after the " desert landscape guru of the @entity45 , " who was also a former garden editor for @entity0 )			1
then again , if @entity2 offers me one more of her mood - altering apple martinis , i might just park myself beside the salt - water pool and spend the rest of the afternoon meditating on the cerulean water			2
sculptures , cycles and cactus not to worry			0
after a mind - clearing dip in the pool , it 's a sunset walk to downtown @entity9 to scope out the town 's public art , beginning with freshly installed sculptures rising out of the @entity34 median against a backdrop of rust - colored mountains			1
the air is as dry as chalk , the fading desert light gallery - perfect for pondering a 25 - foot - long piece pairing an iridescent hummingbird with a damselfly			2
in the morning , it 's a five - minute stroll to @entity72 to rent a bike			2
okay , it would have taken five minutes if i had n't diverted up the block to take a look at the black - and - white midcentury modern house of @entity79 ( better known as @entity80 ) and then dropped in at the @entity81 , a very cool gallery with a large courtyard set with sculptures amid palm trees , cactus and bougainvillea			2
at @entity72 , i 'm feeling conflicted			0
not only does it have all sorts of bikes to rent , but it also offers segways and mopeds			0
still , i 've pledged to be fume - free this weekend , so i opt for a hybrid bicycle and power a mile and a half up a bike lane along @entity97 to the @entity42 , where i 'm just in time for the docent - led tour of paintings of woodlands , seascapes and deserts			1
my favorite : @entity106 's " cloudy day at @entity105 , " from the early 1900s			0
later , i ride the length of @entity34 to the @entity43 , an oasis of curving paths that take you past gurgling waterfalls , cactus - covered sand dunes and a shaded rock - wall canyon			2
if i could somehow get @entity2 to deliver one of her mod - tinis here , i could just chill out all afternoon			2
after dropping my bike off , i hoof it to @entity120 , known for its fresh fish and its vodka bar -- 130 kinds from 19 countries -- where vodka martinis are $ 6 all night long			1
even better , it 's a short walk back to the resort			0
48 hours in @entity9 friday : check into the @entity128 ( from $ 169 ) , owned by a fashion designer from @entity130			1
enjoy a killer margarita on the patio at @entity133 ( average entrées $ 13 - $ 20 ; 73 - 260 @entity34 ; 760/346 - 0744 )			0
saturday : check out the @entity81 ( free ; 45350 @entity135 )			0
then rent a bike ( from $ 25 per day ) or a moped ( from $ 62 per day ) at @entity72 ( 73 - 865 state 111 ; 760/340 - 3861 ) and ride down @entity34 , making a stop at @entity140 ( 45 - 450 state 74 ; 760/776 - 9890 ) , which , with its blue - chip artists , is practically the @entity143 of the desert			0
the nearby @entity145 ( 72 - 567 state 111 ; 760/568 - 1441 ) is a good place to pick up bike - trail maps and explore the surrounding @entity43 ( free ) , a multisensory setting of desert plantings			0
the @entity43 on @entity34 ( 73 - 545 @entity151 ) , an open - air shopping plaza , has a number of excellent dining spots , including @entity155 ( average entrées over $ 31 ; 760/341 - 3560 ) , for steaks and jazz , and @entity120 ( average entrées $ 21 - $ 30 ; 760/674 - 8666 ) , for oysters on the half - shell and cheap martinis			1
sunday : at the @entity42 ( $ 13 ; 47900 @entity164 ; 760/346 - 5694 ) , mornings are a good time to catch the young animals -- like @entity167 , a giraffe calf born in may -- at their most active			1
but first check for the next docent - led tour ( 11 -- 3 ; no set times ) of 50 @entity28 landscape paintings			1
