a man walks into a supermarket , hands over a beer can and receives money back			2
this may seem contrary to the natural order -- but it 's all part of brewer @entity8 's sustainability drive			2
@entity9 to this is @entity8 's use of @entity13 's reverse vending machines , run by @entity14			1
there are 3,000 of these futuristic reverse vending machines dotted around @entity13 , through which 3 million items are deposited every day			1
you put a can or bottle into the machine and it gives you a voucher or money back for your efforts			2
the number of packages returning through the system is astonishing : 90 % of cans designed for single use are recycled , and nearly 100 % of refillable bottles find their way back to @entity8			1
the brewing giant 's bottles and cans themselves are designed to be as sustainable as possible			1
to make packaging more environmentally friendly , " the most obvious thing we can do is reduce the weight , " said @entity36 , @entity37 manager			2
lighter products can lessen energy needed in the manufacturing process , and " within the last 20 years the average weight of a glass bottle has been reduced by approximately 30 % , " @entity36 said			1
the innovation makes the bottles cheaper to manufacture , alongside being better for the environment			1
" for us sustainability , or @entity37 , is business , it 's not something that is detached , " he said			0
from the barley to the bottle , every part of the process is scrutinized by the company 's research and development department to ensure it meets or beats sustainable targets			1
in the @entity8 laboratory , where the ph scale was developed , new types of barley are developed			0
in 2010 the company introduced the @entity70 variety			0
@entity71 , director of applied research , told @entity73 that type of barley " helps beer to stay fresh for a longer time than traditional beer			0
" that gives beer a longer shelf life , reducing waste			0
the by - product of the spent grain also helps power the plant			0
the husk , the outer covering of the barley grain , is placed in a bi-fermentor which transforms the cellulose into methane gas			0
this gas provides 90 % of the thermal energy needed at the plant			1
even the waste from the waste is put to good use -- the waste from the bio-fermentor is used as a natural fertiliser in the barley fields .			0
