@entity0 -- police in @entity3 and the @entity4 have launched separate investigations after two former basketball players alleged that the leader of a youth sports organization molested them during the 1980s when they were boys			1
the former players were interviewed by the @entity11 show " @entity13 " for a story broadcast sunday			1
they allege that @entity14 sexually abused them in hotel rooms during tournaments when they were 12 to 16 years old			1
@entity1 could not reach @entity14 , 63 , for comment			1
@entity11 said it also had been unable to reach him			1
the former players say the alleged incidents occurred when @entity14 was a ymca director in the 1980s			1
calls placed saturday to the @entity23 were not immediately returned			2
but a public relations firm representing the aau outlined saturday the timeline of events that led to @entity14 's dismissal last month , noting that the @entity4 has opened an independent investigation and contacted local law enforcement in @entity0			1
@entity14 has been diagnosed with colon cancer and will not return as president and chief executive officer of the youth organization , the statement said			1
@entity35 , who replaces @entity14 as acting @entity4 president , said the organization has provided the @entity38 " with the limited information we have up to this point " and begun to review such safeguards as screening and training for staff and volunteers			1
" while we believe our network of programs has significant safeguards in place , we will never be complacent about doing all we can to protect the young people in our programs , " he said			2
@entity38 director @entity52 said , " although this case has its challenges due to the amount of time that has passed , it will be thoroughly examined ; and if the investigation reveals the law was violated , the person responsible will be held accountable			2
" the allegations were made amid child sex scandals at @entity63 and @entity64 universities ; both men told @entity11 that the publicity from the scandals prompted them to act			1
one of @entity14 's accusers , identified by @entity11 as @entity69 , said he was 14 at the time of the alleged abuse			1
@entity69 said he was on a basketball team run by @entity14 , who he said would sometimes slip into his hotel room			1
he recalled one incident to the network			2
" must have been 3 in the morning			2
i was dead asleep and i do n't remember anything but waking up and he has his , he 's trying to put his hand in my boxer shorts			2
and i jumped up straight out of the bed and he 's not there , but he 's laying on the floor next to me down by the bed			2
and of course i was freaked out , " @entity69 told @entity11			1
asked how @entity14 could have entered the hotel room , @entity69 said , " he had a key			1
he always somehow had a key to whatever room i was in			0
" @entity69 said he tried to find ways to keep @entity14 out of his hotel room when they were at out - of - town basketball tournaments			1
" i was afraid to even fall asleep when he was around			0
and it got to where i would barricade my , if i had a hotel room , i would take the table and chairs and i 'd block it all against the door , " @entity69 told @entity11			1
" and it got to where he could n't assault me , but he would push his way in the room and then end up , i 'd see , i would n't see him , i would hear him , he 'd lay at the floor of the bed masturbating			0
and you just lay there horrified			0
but you do n't know what to do			0
what , are you going to blow the lid off of this at 14 years ? all you want to do is pretend it did n't happen and not address it at all			0
you want to hide and bury it			0
" asked what evidence he has , @entity69 said , " i 'm the evidence			0
i 'm not trying to gain anything out of it			0
it 's not like , ' oh , wow , here , let me go on national tv and humiliate myself and possibly embarrass my family and stuff so i can tell everybody this deep , dark secret that i 've had			0
' the guy should n't be around kids any more			0
" @entity69 said @entity14 abused him or tried to abuse him six times			1
@entity69 showed @entity11 an e-mail he said he sent to the aau 's compliance department on november 9 accusing @entity14 of being a pedophile , the network reported on its website			1
he said he got no response to the e-mail			0
but the head of the @entity135 - based media relations firm hired by @entity4 to manage the crisis offered a detailed account of how the organization learned about and then responded to the accusations			1
the @entity4 headquarters in @entity141 , @entity135 , began to receive " brief , cryptic , anonymous e-mails on november 7 , 8 and 9 that alleged , in very general ways , acts of child sexual abuse by @entity147 , " said @entity148 of the @entity135 - based @entity149			1
" one of them referenced the year 1984 with nothing further , another referenced the 1970s , " he said			0
those messages were sent to @entity4 's compliance office and to the organization 's general counsel , @entity148 said			1
after business hours on november 9 , the @entity4 office received similar anonymous , brief messages on its telephone answering machine that were retrieved the following day by staff members , he said			1
aau officers were told of the allegations on november 11 , and flew to @entity141 to meet at aau offices with @entity14 on november 14 , @entity148 said			1
" @entity14 informed the officers that he had also received calls making these kinds of general allegations during the same time period of the first half of november , " @entity148 said			2
" during the meeting on the 14th , he repeatedly denied the allegations to the officers			2
" he was then told " to take leave from the office and his post and not to return to the office and , in fact , he has not returned since			0
" the officers initiated an internal investigation and hired a private investigator to whom they turned over the accusatory phone messages and e-mails , @entity148 said			0
he described the messages as " brief , cryptic and anonymous			0
" the phone messages did not leave call - back numbers and the e-mails were not in the name of a person , he said			0
" what the organization did was take very seriously the allegation , general as it was , by acting directly through their compliance office , general counsel and engaging a private investigator , " @entity148 said			0
the other accuser , whom @entity11 did not identify , said @entity14 gave him alcohol before taking him to a bedroom and touching him inappropriately			1
" we were at his house and he provided us with some alcohol and , looking back on it now , i know for a fact that he put something in my , my drink that night , because the last thing that i can really remember was him carrying me into his bedroom and i can remember him , you know , touching me in ways that i , i did n't uh , i did n't want another man touching me , " the accuser said			0
the man said he called @entity147 on nov ember 11 and confronted him			0
@entity14 , he said , then apologized for the alleged abuse			2
the network said it examined the man 's phone records and verified an eight - minute phone call to @entity14 's number			2
both men said they had never reported the alleged incidents to police and had only recently told their families , @entity11 said			2
about the same time that the accusations were unfolding , @entity14 learned that he had colon cancer and underwent surgery , @entity148 said			1
on friday , december 9 , the aau notified the @entity38 about the allegations and offered to cooperate with any investigation , @entity148 said			0
" it is my understanding that , until that time , the @entity0 police had not been contacted by any complainant " about the allegations , he said			0
the aau has directed its private investigator to stand down " for the time being " in order not to interfere with any law enforcement investigation of the matter , he said			0
but it is undertaking its own investigation into the matter by reviewing its policies , procedures and protocols , he said			0
the aau has 80,000 adult volunteers involved in coaching and working with hundreds of thousands of young people , he said			0
@entity1 's @entity250 , @entity251 , @entity252 and @entity253 contributed to this report .			0
