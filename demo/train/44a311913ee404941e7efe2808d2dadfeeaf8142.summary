-- the bright yellow front wall of the compound is lined with perfectly pruned palm trees			2
our hosts open a metal gate and usher us inside to a large yard with a fresh - cut lawn , more palm trees and a circular pool in the middle			1
the house itself is a two - story dwelling , also painted in bright yellow with white accents and double - paned windows with arched tops and red tile roof			1
in any large @entity21 city , this house would be a suburban , upper - middle class home -- but here in the town of @entity26 , located in a mainly rural area of the @entity29 southwestern state of @entity30 , it seems much grander , certainly in stark contrast with the adobe houses next door			1
" this is now our barracks , " says a vigilante who spoke to us on condition of anonymity			2
" some of our guys sleep and eat here			2
some took the weapons that used to belong to the trafficker			2
" when we visited , half - a - dozen vigilantes stood guard outside			1
our hosts are a group of local men who rose up in arms against the @entity48 , a rather romantic name for a criminal organization known not only for drug trafficking , but also for terrorizing people in this part of @entity29 through extortion , executions , rape and murder			1
the drug war in @entity29 , which has been raging since former president @entity59 started fighting back against the cartels in 2006 , has claimed 100,000 lives			1
states like @entity30 are largely in the control of the cartels : 90 per cent of the cocaine that enters the @entity21 does so through @entity29			1
the country is also a major supplier of marijuana , methamphetamine and , more recently , heroin			1
the mansion 's owner , @entity71 , also known as " @entity73 " ( @entity74 ) , fled on january 10 when the town rose up in arms against him and his gunmen			2
they say he left so fast that he even abandoned some of his weapons in the house			2
@entity71 is a lieutenant under the leadership of @entity83 , also known as " @entity84 , " the head of the @entity48 cartel			2
some 20 towns have been retaken from the drug gangs , according to the vigilantes , but @entity83 , the former schoolteacher - turned - cartel leader , still holds a tight grip over @entity30 , ruling with intimidation and violence			1
he makes occasional public appearances , handing out money to the poor -- he considers himself an altruist -- and loudly trying to justify his presence in the state			2
" [ the @entity48 ] are a necessary evil , " he once told an assembled crowd			2
" fortunately -- or unfortunately -- we are here			2
if we were n't , another group would come			0
" on a decorative opening in the foyer of his lieutenant 's former residence , standing next to a modern art statue , is a mini 14 , an assault rifle that fires .223 - caliber bullets like an @entity112 , left behind by @entity71 when he fled			1
this one had a 30 - round magazine			1
the rifle sits next to a bulletproof vest			0
from the foyer , a hallway connects to a living area with a large , dark brown leather recliner in the middle			0
on the wall , there 's a rack for a large flat screen tv ; but the vigilante groups have looted the house already and many pieces of furniture are missing , giving the residence the feeling of a house whose owners have just moved out			0
it 's still clean , with the exception of the bathrooms , but the beds are unmade and there are pieces of furniture and objects in odd places			0
the vigilantes are giving us access to what was believed to be @entity71 ' " family home			1
" it 's hard to miss that the house shares two walls with the @entity152			0
the church is also painted in similar colors : bright yellow and white			0
this is not the only property the vigilantes have occupied that used to belong to the cartel lieutenant			1
he also owned a nearby ranch called " @entity164 " ( @entity165 ) , which is surrounded by grapefruit trees and hundreds of hectares of avocado trees , the fruit of which has made the state of @entity30 known around the world			0
the vigilantes also confiscated a couple of vehicles that were left at the property : a white , late - model , @entity176 pickup truck and a modified truck painted matt black			1
the latter was fitted with half - inch steel plates and shooting portals in the double cabin and in the back			1
it had signs of having been in a shootout , riddled with bullet holes on the driver 's side , the hood and the windshield			0
the property also features a shed with white pillars and red tile roof covering a living area with grills and chairs leading to the lawn connecting to the two - level circular pool divided in the middle			1
the vigilantes have been accused of looting the properties they have confiscated , and indeed some have been charged with excesses			1
but they are , by and large , treated as heroes by the people they have agreed to protect			0
a vigilante in the nearby town of @entity209 , who covers his face with a ski mask and identifies himself as " @entity213 , " says they say they had no option but to rise up in arms to protect their people and lands			0
" if the government ca n't help you , you have to help yourself , " @entity213 says			1
" all we want to do is just pick up the arms so that we can drive them away			0
after that we 're just going to put them down again			0
" @entity213 speaks @entity226 with a southern @entity21 accent			0
he says he lived in @entity228 from the time he was eight years old and returned to @entity29 when he was 20			1
he 's now 24 and a married father of two			0
the federal government 's attitude towards the vigilante groups appears to be changing too			1
once the army and police would round up the irregulars : now the authorities appear to want to legalize them , freeing them up to fight the cartels			1
@entity240 , the leader of yet another vigilante group in the town of @entity243 , says they have kept the movement against organized crime with the same resources the @entity48 used to attack them in the past			0
" with the same resources that used to belong to the @entity48 , their ranches and properties , we 're financing this movement , " @entity240 says			0
" we did it at first and we continue to do so			0
" he remains philosophical about the dangers in which he has placed himself			0
" i am not afraid			0
we are all going to die anyway			0
" the vigilantes are also returning property they say the @entity48 stole from local people including ranches , lime orchards , wells , farming machinery and vehicles			1
the same morning we spoke to @entity240 , @entity263 , a town resident , visited to personally thank him for allowing her and her family to recover their lime orchards			0
" i think they 're doing the right thing , " @entity271 says , " i think it was a very brave thing to do because they stood up for everybody			0
" her family , @entity271 says , had to flee after 30 armed men showed up at their property demanding the title			1
" they wanted to charge the people who picked lemons and they wanted to charge people who owned houses			0
the drug cartels were just sucking the money out of everybody and it was just going too far			2

the eight - year drugs war has claimed around 100,000 lives in @entity29
now federal government policy towards vigilantes appears to be changing
in @entity26 , vigilantes show @entity0 a home that they recently confiscated
in some parts of @entity29 , vigilantes are returning property to *victims* of drugs cartels
