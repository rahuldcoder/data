when @entity1 , a likely @entity2 presidential candidate , signed up for the photo - sharing app @entity3 on wednesday , it set off a predictable round of mockery about the @entity9 senator			1
haha ! chanted the @entity11 chorus of @entity13 snark			0
look at this 51 - year - old man signing up for the buzzy social media platform in a lame effort to win over the @entity17 ! " @entity21 , " was @entity19 's take on the matter			1
even the senator himself admitted that edgy social media platforms can be drained of their cool factor once older users try to elbow in on the fun			1
" young people are flocking to it , until the grownups show up and people go somewhere else , " @entity1 said in an interview with @entity29			1
taken together , the blizzard of @entity1 ridicule contained at least one inarguable kernel of truth : signing up for neat social apps wo n't solve the @entity2 's complicated relationship with younger voters			1
the @entity2 's collective aversion to same - sex marriage , which is favored by a large majority of @entity44 under 30 , is one bigger obstacle that comes to mind			1
but politicians -- at least the smart ones -- are n't just flocking to new platforms because they 're trying to be hip , though that 's certainly part of the calculation			1
they 're joining them because that 's increasingly where the voters are			1
" it 's pretty simple , " said @entity58 , a @entity2 consultant who specializes in digital strategy and spends as much time in @entity60 as he does in the trenches of national politics			1
" @entity1 is talking to younger voters on a platform where they are spending all their time			1
" how @entity44 consume news during the 2012 presidential campaign , the @entity67 released a treasure trove of research about how @entity44 are consuming news			1
@entity71 remained the no. 1 news source for @entity44 , but viewership was on the decline , especially among young people			2
while older people were continuing to tune in at relatively steady rates , less than a third of @entity44 between age 18 and 24 reported watching television news the previous day , @entity67 found			2
and print and radio ? done - zo			2
instead , teens and twenty - somethings in 2012 were turning to digital sources and social networking platforms for news -- especially on their mobile phones , where millions of thumbs are constantly scanning @entity90 , @entity91 , @entity92 , @entity93 or @entity94 at all hours of the day and night			1
this migration of news to the @entity98 , an expansive topic hashed out in a million newspaper obituaries , sober academic studies on " disruption " and in gushing articles about the triumph of @entity103 , is a phenomenon hardly limited to young consumers			1
every day , our @entity91 feeds are flooded with some incredible statistic about how @entity44 across the board are abandoning traditional news and entertainment sources and flocking to digital or on - demand content			1
both broadcast and cable television viewership has tumbled across the board , a trend documented by both the ratings and scads of academic studies			0
@entity67 released an intriguing one just last week : in 1985 , it reported , roughly half of @entity44 could correctly identify @entity122 as the anchor of the @entity124 , then the top - ranked evening news broadcast in the country			1
but last year , only 27 % of the country could correctly name @entity128 , who anchors the @entity129			0
put another way , three - quarters of the country has no idea who anchors the highest - rated evening news broadcast in the country			1
this is the stuff @entity138 's dreams were made of			0
meanwhile , an entire wing of the @entity140 could be filled with @entity142 style section essays bemoaning our creeping addiction to mobile devices and the @entity13			0
three - quarters of all adults now regularly use a social networking site , most likely @entity90 , which still commands mind - boggling reach despite it 's tumbling street cred among young people			1
there are more active wireless devices in the @entity44 ( 326 million ) than there are human beings ( 314 million )			2
more than 6 billion hours of video are watched on @entity158 every month			0
@entity29 's digital platforms ( shameless plug ) had an average of 2.4 billion total global page views per month in 2013			1
@entity94 has an estimated 8 million users , which represents only a narrow sliver of the electorate			1
that number , though , is much larger than the daily viewership of any tv morning show			1
campaign strategists agree that television remains the most powerful forum for political messaging			0
buying airtime during highly rated television programs is expensive for a reason			0
news broadcasts can still be potent vehicles , too			2
witness how the marathon of televised @entity2 primary debates in 2011 and 2012 shaped public opinion about the race			0
but as the reach of television news dwindles , so does its political power			2
" tv is still effective and still going to command the lion 's share of campaign budgets , " said @entity186 , a @entity2 strategist who recently launched @entity187 , a @entity188 - based ad firm devoted exclusively to producing online video for campaigns			1
" but it 's undeniable that every year millions of viewers are either cutting the cord or spending more time watching @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity158 , @entity199 or some platform we have n't even heard of yet			1
the trend is only going in one direction			0
" in 2012 , the re-election campaign of president @entity205 had a firm grasp on the fracturing media ecosystem			0
it used sophisticated algorithms to identify potential voters and target them with paid media			2
but unlike past campaigns , it did n't bother relying on legacy media organizations or @entity216 briefings to get the message out			0
it ran campaign ads on the @entity221 network , or during " @entity224 " reruns , or it designed creative " infographics " and pumped them directly into the @entity90 bloodstream for supporters to share			0
" we 're just fishing where the fish are , " said former @entity205 strategist @entity229 in a study released last year by @entity232 's @entity231			0
did @entity236 ? " our job as a campaign was to find out the viewing habits and the reading habits of the people who were going to be decisive in the campaign , " @entity229 said			0
" and as it turns out , a lot of those people were low - information voters who were absolutely not reading the @entity142 and likely were n't reading a newspaper at all			1
they were n't watching the @entity124 or @entity247 or ' @entity129			0
' they were n't watching ' @entity249			0
' they were more likely to have been watching @entity251 or reruns of ' @entity253			0
' " enter the junior senator from @entity9 , who had a similar take on @entity94 , finding some common ground with @entity229			1
" if you want to get a message out , you have got to go where people are , " @entity1 said			0
" it 's not necessarily choosing one medium over another			0
it 's just knowing that there are hundreds of media outlets out there			0
" @entity1 also seemed to understand another important truth about campaigning in the internet age : the message has to be tailored to the medium			0
in @entity94 's case , that means sharing content that 's concise , witty or just plain wacky			1
" the way that you communicate is just as important as what you say in it , " said @entity275			0
" you 've got @entity93 and @entity92 video and tout and all these mediums			0
but it 's not just about putting your bumper sticker everywhere			0
it 's about proving to your more technologically savvy audience that you get it			2
" it 's taken some time for politicians to figure this out			1
in 2006 and 2007 , before @entity205 became the golden boy of the @entity13 , it was actually @entity292 who pioneered the use of social media during the @entity296 fight			2
the @entity292 campaign produced @entity158 " webisodes " ( filmed by someone named @entity300 ) and signed the campaign up for every social network imaginable ( remember @entity303 ? )			2
but it felt perfunctory and inauthentic : the @entity292 message was the same across all platforms			2
and for those looking for an even more cringe - worthy example , just @entity312 " @entity311 " and " @entity310			2
" on thursday , the libertarian - leaning @entity1 sent out his third " snap " to his followers : a video of him flying a remote control drone around his @entity317 office , a winking reference to the overseas unmanned missile attacks he so despises			2
the previous day , he blasted out a black - and - white picture of the moon under the banner : " hey @entity324 check this out ! you 've been ' mooned			2
' " " people take things way too seriously , " @entity1 said			0
" the news cycle too often does n't have any humor in it			0
i am always telling my staff to be on the lookout for humorous stuff			0
" the troubling downside to the explosion of news platforms , on mobile and elsewhere , is message control			1
campaigns can keep their candidates cocooned far away from the mainstream media and deliver " news " on their own terms , without having to face very many difficult questions from obnoxious reporters			0
but in this era of fraying relationships between the press and politicians , @entity94 offered at least one glimmer of hope this week			1
this reporter , eager to chat with a presidential hopeful on thursday , paused during a stroll on @entity356 and sent @entity1 a @entity94 message requesting an interview			1
thirty minutes later , he was on the line , raring to talk .			0
