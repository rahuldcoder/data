@entity1 dock workers and port management have been locked in heated labor negotiations since their contract expired in july of 2014			1
such negotiations are often difficult and proceed in fits and starts			1
but in this case , the increasingly contentious and protracted dispute could have major economic consequences for @entity12 if it is n't settled soon			1
during these negotiations , port operations have gradually slowed as each side seeks to put pressure on the other			2
the @entity18 and the @entity19 need to set aside their differences and reach an agreement that will ensure the continued success and competitiveness of these ports			2
and it is imperative that an agreement be reached without any further slowdowns or shutdowns			2
this serious drag in talks threatens to disrupt the @entity32 economic recovery , which is still fragile			1
the negotiators are n't the ones suffering -- it 's all of the other industries , employers and employees throughout the country who depend on goods moving in and out of the ports			1
agricultural exports are rotting at the ports , and in some cases , in the fields			2
they ca n't be picked because they ca n't be shipped			2
manufacturers are shutting down shifts for lack of imported parts and losing overseas customers because goods are not being shipped , or they 're resorting to air shipments that cost significantly more than traditional shipping methods			0
retailers are not getting critical merchandise for the upcoming spring and summer seasons			0
trucking and railroad companies are either sitting idle or handling far less cargo , and trains are not moving westward because they can not unload , which is causing disruptions in the rail freight system across the country			0
this brinksmanship is also causing long - term damage to the reliability of @entity32 companies			0
when international customers ca n't get what they need from @entity32 suppliers -- both agricultural and manufactured -- there are plenty of competitors from other countries ready to step in			2
once those contracts are lost , they will be very difficult to get back			0
similarly , there will be long - term consequences for the @entity1 ports as shippers and those who rely on goods moving in and out of these ports find other ways to bring their cargo into @entity12 -- either through @entity88 , @entity89 or through the expanded @entity90 to the @entity92 and @entity93 ports			1
even if a deal was done tomorrow , there will be many months before all the backed up cargo is pushed through the system			0
ultimately , if there is a full shutdown , it will cost exporters , importers , shippers and others an estimated $ 2 billion a day			0
the 10 - day shutdown in 2002 cost the economy and estimated $ 1 billion a day and took a half year to clear out the backlog of containers			0
the situation has reached crisis point , and the parties must find a way to get a deal and get goods moving again			0
the situation is so urgent , and distress over the @entity1 ports has become so widespread , that lawmakers from both sides of the aisle held a news conference at the @entity122 last week to press for action			1
we have called on president @entity125 to use his bully pulpit to ramp up the urgency on these negotiations and make clear to the parties that the country is desperate for them to get a deal			1
we were pleased to see that president @entity125 dispatched secretary of labor @entity134 to @entity136 to meet with the parties and convey to them the desperate need to find a resolution			1
we 've been encouraged that secretary @entity134 has reached out to learn about the impacts this stalemate is causing throughout the country			0
if a full shutdown does occur , we will request that the president use his full authority under the @entity147 to force the parties back into negotiations and keep the ports open			1
the answer , though , is for the parties to come together now and reach an agreement .			0

@entity156 negotiations on @entity1 ports will have major economic impact if the dispute is n't settled soon
@entity161 : president @entity125 can use his bully pulpit to ramp up the urgency on these talks
