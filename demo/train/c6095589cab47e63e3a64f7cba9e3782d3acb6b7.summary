@entity0 -- wider restrictions on fishing in the @entity4 are raising fresh concerns in an industry already hard - hit by the massive @entity8 oil spill			1
with thousands of barrels of oil still spewing out of a damaged undersea well every day , the @entity9 announced tuesday that it was nearly doubling the portion of the @entity4 's federal waters that are now closed to fishing			1
the restricted zone now pushes south and east into the heart of the @entity4 -- another blow to a $ 2.4 billion industry already reeling from the nearly month - old spill			1
for @entity21 , a commercial fisherman in @entity22 , @entity23 , that means his boats are being pushed further west to chase big catch like bluefin tuna , swordfish and mahi - mahi			1
" they 'll have to go in somewhere else , probably around @entity31 ( @entity32 ) , instead of coming home , " @entity21 said			2
" that 'll cause some problems , but it 's better to be safe than sorry			2
" @entity38 fisherman get paid for helping cleanup @entity21 owns a fleet of 14 fishing boats and hires another 41			2
one of them has caught 80 tuna in a seven - day stretch off the @entity4 's @entity45 , a haul he called a " great start " to a seven - month season			1
" now he has to leave the current and go farther west , " @entity21 said			2
@entity9 's latest order extends the closed zone to a nearly 46,000 - square - mile stretch , about 19 percent of the @entity4			1
the ongoing spill now threatens to be picked up by the @entity55 , which could spread some oil around the tip of @entity23 and up the @entity59 @entity58			2
unconfirmed reports from researchers that large amounts of oil is spreading below the surface , as well as concerns about the effect of chemical dispersants used to break up the spill , also worry people in the industry			2
@entity71 , a spokeswoman for the @entity72 , said fishermen could face a " multi-generational effect " on the creatures from which they draw their living , with shrimp and bluefin tuna the two species with the most to lose			1
" we 're not just worried about the shrimp stocks here , " @entity71 said			0
" we 're worried about the entire marine food chain			0
" many areas off the @entity38 and @entity85 coasts remain open to both commercial and recreational fishing as @entity8 , the @entity88 and volunteers try to battle the spreading slick offshore			0
but news accounts of the spill have prompted tourists to cancel fishing trips even in waters that are so far unaffected , said @entity95 , of @entity96 in @entity97 , @entity98			0
" the oil has n't done a thing to us -- it 's the exposure , " @entity95 said tuesday			0
he added , " our water 's still open , we 're still trying to fish every chance we can , and we 're open for business			1
" and some of those who are still able to get out on the water are now seeing buyers go elsewhere , said @entity107 , a crab fisherman in @entity38 's @entity108			1
state - controlled waters near @entity110 were opened for three days starting saturday , @entity107 said			0
he and his father laid crab traps last weekend in @entity113 and came back with an ice chest full of crustaceans -- but he said many of his buyers have turned to suppliers in western @entity38 , which is n't currently threatened by the spill			1
tar balls found in @entity121 not believed to be from @entity4 spill " i 'm stressed			1
i 'm pacing back and forth , and i 'm normally a calm guy , " he said			0
however , " the big wholesalers are in the same predicament i am right now , " he said			0
the closures follow an april 20 explosion that sank the drilling platform @entity128 , taking 11 workers with it			0
efforts to shut down the well that was ripped open by the accident have failed so far , though well owner @entity8 says it has been able to capture some of the escaping oil and pump it to a ship on the surface			0
" the fish will move			1
they will travel , " @entity21 said			0
" i 'm just kind of upset that they did n't have a plan b to the plan a for the cleanup , and the government was n't doing their job to keep an eye on @entity8			0
