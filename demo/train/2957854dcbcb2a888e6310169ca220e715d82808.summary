-- @entity2 defense secretary @entity1 warns that excessive partisanship could well " hollow out " the military , saying " we can not tolerate " if @entity5 fails to reach an accord on debt reduction and thereby triggers hundreds of billions of dollars in across - the - board cuts			1
speaking with @entity0 's @entity9 in an interview that aired monday on the first edition of her program " @entity14 , " @entity1 said that he was prepared to slash about $ 450 billion from the defense budget over the next decade , as currently mandated			1
but he described as potentially dangerous any deeper cuts , like the $ 1.2 trillion that would be unavoidable if a bipartisan panel does not reach a debt - reduction accord in the coming weeks that is then passed by @entity5 and signed by president @entity20			1
" if the @entity5 is irresponsible enough to suddenly turn on this sequester idea ( leading to massive , automatic cuts to defense ) because they failed to meet their responsibility , that would clearly damage our national defense , " @entity1 said			1
" ( @entity28 ) in some kind of blind fashion that basically hits everything ... is going to result in hollowing out the force			0
we can not tolerate that			0
we still risk too many threats out there to weaken our defense			0
" the former @entity39 director , presidential chief of staff and @entity2 congressman did n't appear optimistic that @entity5 will rise to the challenge , describing the " inability to confront the challenges that are out there , " divisions between political leaders and partisanship as the worst in his 40 years in @entity42			1
@entity1 added that there is merit to many @entity2 ' view that " @entity42 is dysfunctional and not able to respond to these challenges , " like the debt issue			1
" i really do think that both sides have to understand how concerned not only @entity2 are , but the rest of the world is , about our ability to solve the problems that face us , " he said			2
the secretary spoke shortly before embarking on a trip to the @entity62 and , eventually , to @entity63 for a @entity65 meeting			0
on monday , he was in @entity66 and visited the @entity68 territory of the @entity69			0
his next stop will be in @entity71			0
in his wide - ranging interview , @entity1 addressed several issues and threats			2
chief among them was @entity77 , which he accused of sending " pretty sophisticated weaponry to go after @entity2 " in @entity81 , working to " undermine governments in the @entity62 " and trying to " foster ( and ) supply terrorism			1
" " that 's not what the @entity2 does , " he said			2
" what we hope to do is work with the countries in that region so that they can have the capability to defend themselves against that kind of terrorism			0
" the defense chief also addressed @entity2 's " complicated relationship with @entity101 , " acknowledging that nation 's battle with terrorism and calling it imperative to build a " cooperative relationship			1
" he also pointed to -- as other top @entity2 officials have in the past -- some @entity101 officials ' relationship with members of the @entity107 , which he claims goes into @entity109 to attack @entity2 troops then returns to its " safe haven " in @entity101			2
" they understand the threat of terrorism , but they also ca n't pick and choose among terrorists , " @entity1 said of @entity101 officials			1
" that is where we have some differences			0
" @entity1 addressed the growth -- and reported growing militarization -- of @entity125 , insisting his goal is to have a " transparent " relationship so that " we understand each other			2
" that said , he noted concerns if @entity125 further develops weaponry and expands its military presence			0
" for that reason , we always have to have a forward presence in the @entity135 that makes very clear that we have to protect the international community ... and their ability to protect their own interests , " he said .			0
