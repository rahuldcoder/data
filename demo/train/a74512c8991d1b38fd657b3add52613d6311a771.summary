@entity0 started playing @entity2 's online game " @entity3 " in 2005 at the urging of her then 10 - year - old goddaughter			1
it 's become a place where she can spend time with her husband and two sons , working together on tasks and feeling like part of the larger " @entity3 " community			1
now @entity2 is shutting the virtual world down and many long - time players like @entity0 are dealing with the loss of an online home			1
launched in 2003 , @entity2 's " @entity29 " is a game for children and families where players work together to battle evil robots called @entity24 , or pass the time growing gardens , fishing , and racing cars on the @entity28			1
in @entity3 , members can also just hang out and chat with the friends they 've made in the virtual world			1
after 10 years and a significant drop in user numbers , @entity2 has decided to instead focus its resources on the more popular " @entity35 " virtual world , which has about 200 million registered users			1
" @entity3 " will be shuttered september 19			0
the closing of an online virtual game may sound trivial to anyone who has never used or visited one , but to the people who spent a chunk of their formative years forging relationships inside their virtual walls , the loss can be huge			1
for players of massively multiplayer online games ( called mmos or @entity51 ) an online game can feel like a richly populated parallel universe with a distinct culture and set of social groups			1
" when a virtual world closes , its users lose many things all at once , " said @entity56 , a researcher who has been studying virtual worlds for 14 years			1
" a living , breathing community with its own unique culture , slang , and lore ; an accessible and familiar hangout with regulars and familiar faces ; an online identity and persona that they 're emotionally invested in and cultivated over time ; and a social network of friends who have shared many experiences together			1
" mmos can be a place to try on different identities			0
you get to choose how you are presented and make connections without worrying about looks or other snap judgments			0
" this game is a home to us , a place where we can be who we are , where we can just be normal without discrimination and judgment , " said longtime " @entity3 " member @entity82			2
in a large online survey of players from games such as " @entity94 , " @entity56 found 24 % of players had confided personal issues or secrets to online friends that they had not told their real life friends			2
the online communities can feel just as real as their in - person worlds -- 41 % said the friends they 'd made online were comparable or better friends than the ones they had in real life			2
other massively multiplayer online games have shut down after multiyear runs			1
after eight years , the " @entity110 " game was given the @entity112 treatment and destroyed in 2011			0
many of those players migrated to " @entity115 : the @entity116			0
" after " uru : @entity127 " closed for the first time in 2004 , 10,000 players were virtual " refugees " who moved on to other virtual worlds like " @entity122 , " according to @entity123 who studied the displaced @entity117 players as part of her ph.d. thesis			2
@entity2 is hoping the diaspora of " @entity3 " players will find a new home in " @entity35			1
" @entity3 " is far from being the most well - known or popular mmo to shut down , but that has n't stopped a vocal outpouring of protests from the dedicated fan base			2
there is a @entity138 petition asking @entity2 to keep " @entity3 " open and it has already gathered more than 9,000 signatures from members around the world			1
" to some it was more than a mere game			0
adventures , exploration , meeting new friends and so much more ... it had a lot of meaning to all of us , " reads the petition			0
because " @entity3 " was a family game open to anyone 7 and older , many of its more dedicated users started as children and grew into young adults while playing the game , making it an integral part of their childhood			2
" i think ' @entity3 ' is unique in that its long - time users literally grew up with the game , " said @entity56			1
" it 's a little like me telling someone that they 're tearing down ' @entity168			0
' or that they 're tearing down the neighborhood playground where you used to play			0
" those tight relationships made in the game world frequently carried over into real life			0
there were even in - person gatherings for players called @entity178 at @entity2 and @entity179			1
adults also used it to communicate with their younger family members			0
after a divorce , @entity183 found himself 3,000 miles from his young son			0
the two have turned to " @entity3 " as an entertaining alternative to @entity188			0
" most people know 8 - year - old boys do n't want to talk on the phone much			0
' @entity3 ' has become the solution for us to spend time together , " said @entity183			2
" we can log in , my son in @entity195 and my daughter and i in @entity197 and all play together while talking , laughing and spending quality family time together			0
" grandparents like @entity201 used it to keep in touch with grandkids , though she recently cut down after the 12 - year - old grandson she played with the most moved on to " @entity206			0

@entity2 is closing its online virtual game " @entity3 " after 10 years
many long - time players are upset that they *'ll* lose contact with the " @entity3 " community
when massively multiplayer games close , players frequently feel a sense of loss
