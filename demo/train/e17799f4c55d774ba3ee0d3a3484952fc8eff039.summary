-- @entity2 has issued an international wanted notice for a @entity5 gangster who authorities say used explosives as part of a brazen escape from a prison in @entity11 , @entity5 , over the weekend , the organization said monday			1
@entity13 held five people , including four guards , at gunpoint at the detention center saturday , officials said			1
he then burst his way to freedom by detonating explosives that destroyed five doors , penitentiary union spokesman @entity22 told @entity0 affiliate @entity23			0
@entity2 announced monday that it issued its wanted notice , known as a red notice , within hours of @entity13 's escape			1
a @entity28 arrest warrant covering 26 countries also was issued for him saturday			1
red notices alert police agencies around the world that a person is wanted , but they are not arrest warrants			0
each of @entity2 's 190 member countries is expected to apply its national laws and standards in determining whether to detain the wanted person			1
@entity13 's escape has raised a number of questions : how did an inmate get guns and explosives ? how did he manage to use those to force his way out ? and , after all that , why is he still at large ? the four guards whom @entity13 allegedly held hostage " are safe and sound , " @entity11 prosecutor @entity49 said			1
still , officials from the prison guards ' union pressed @entity5 justice minister @entity55 to make prisons safer , including more thorough searches of those who enter , @entity23 reported			0
the escape may be due partly to a problem plaguing the prison that could n't hold @entity13 : overcrowding			1
built in 2005 , the @entity11 - @entity63 penitentiary is not old , but it 's not well designed to keep watch on prisoners , said @entity66 , a former associate director there			1
" the construction ... makes it particularly difficult to manage detainees , who are particularly difficult to watch , " @entity66 told @entity23			0
and such a prison was holding a convict who fashioned himself as a modern - day gangster			2
@entity13 , 40 , thought big , getting inspiration from the movies			2
he wore a hockey mask , like @entity79 's character in the movie " @entity81 , " and acted audaciously in attacking armored trucks among other targets			2
" he lives his life like a hero from a @entity90 film , " said @entity84 , who edited @entity13 's 2010 autobiography , " robber : from suburbs to @entity92			1
" @entity13 wanted to be a robber from the age of 6 , @entity84 said			2
" he wants to be known as the greatest gangster -- public enemy no. 1 , so this morning all the papers are calling him just that , " @entity84 said			1
" i think that 's his satisfaction			0
" in 1998 , after three years on the run during which he fled to @entity101 , @entity13 was caught			1
sentenced to 20 years , he spent time in high - security prisons around @entity5			0
after more than a decade behind bars , the @entity5 insisted he 'd changed			0
but this promise did n't last long , @entity5 authorities said			0
in 2011 , @entity13 landed back behind bars			0
@entity107 , @entity13 's lawyer , said he is not surprised by the breakout			2
@entity107 had planned to meet his client soon in preparation for an upcoming trial tied to a may 2010 attack in @entity113 , east of @entity114 , that left a 26 - year - old policewoman dead			0
" he is remarkably intelligent , and he is using his intellect to serve his ambitions , " @entity107 told @entity23			0
" ( and @entity13 ) can not stand being imprisoned any more			0

@entity119 : " he wants to be known as the greatest gangster , " escaped prisoner 's former editor says
