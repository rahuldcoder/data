@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity0 was once a thriving town on the southern outskirts of @entity5			1
residents of the @entity1 capital came to buy their furniture here and many factories , now abandoned , still line the main street into town			2
but the grinding , two - and - a - half - year war here has reduced @entity0 to rubble			2
its residents first fled when the town fell into the hands of rebels battling to bring an end to the reign of @entity1 president @entity24			2
but in early november the @entity1 army reclaimed @entity0 after a long and costly siege			1
the military pounded rebel positions with tanks , artillery and heavy machine guns for weeks in the lead - up to the siege			0
@entity24 's men then raided the town , taking it back house by house			0
various opposition groups that had occupied @entity0 blamed each other for losing the battle , saying some rebel fighters had put up very little resistance against government troops			1
we toured the destroyed town with a detachment from the @entity1 army led by a soldier who goes by the name of @entity50			2
" is this their freedom ? " @entity50 said , walking past a pock - marked building			0
" the soldiers walked us through a block of interconnected houses , where the rebels who occupied @entity0 for nearly a year punched holes through the walls in order to move safely from apartment to apartment , rather than fall prey to a sniper 's scope out in the streets			2
government soldiers also uncovered a series of tunnels that the rebels were using to get supplies towards the front line			0
in one apartment we find a huge hole in the ground leading down to a tunnel used to smuggle weapons and ammunition to a sniper 's vantage point at the other end			0
" our soldiers took heavy casualties from this position , " @entity50 said			0
" it was very difficult to get this done , but we did it , and we will keep going until the end because we believe in our country			0
" @entity1 troops showed us various locations in @entity0 they claim served as headquarters for rebel groups ranging from the moderate @entity96 to the @entity97			1
@entity50 also took us to a room that he says served as weapons - manufacturing workshop for opposition fighters			1
@entity50 says rebels used these improvised mini-factories to make mortars , rockets and improvised bombs			0
" they used the tools to make mortars and rockets and used gas cylinders to make very large bombs , " he said , standing amid the debris inside the room			0
the government says @entity0 was vital for resupplying its fighters in the southern outskirts of @entity5			1
losing areas around the capital dealt a heavy blow to the @entity1 regime 's efforts to win the war , and the government has made it a priority to take the suburbs back			1
the @entity1 army 's victory at @entity0 was a strategic triumph for the government as it tries to unseat rebels from the large swaths of territory they 've taken east and south of the capital			1
but while the soldiers rejoice at their hard - fought win , the real losers are the citizens of this once vibrant suburb who wo n't be able to return any time soon			0
