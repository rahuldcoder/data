-- it 's the putt all golfers want to be stood over			0
the final hole of a masters weekend , find the cup and the coveted green jacket is yours			2
your heart is racing , your palms sweaty , can you maintain your focus ? the contender surveys the scene , taking in the erupting volcano and giant wooden heads which line the @entity17 course before delicately guiding her shot off a brick and into the hole			1
no , not the @entity20 , but a minigolf course in @entity22			2
not @entity23 , but 18 - year - old @entity24 , one of the world 's leading minigolf players and a double @entity27 champion			1
" i started playing as a three - year - old kid , " the @entity28 told @entity0			1
" my dad worked as a sports reporter and he took me with him to an interview he did with a minigolf trainer			2
i tried to play there and really liked it			0
apparently , i kept asking when we would go back to play more			0
" since then , i played regularly , and started going to tournaments			1
" @entity39 , commonly referred to as crazy golf , originated in 1867 at the @entity41 in @entity42 , @entity43			0
with women at the time keen to play the conventional game , and the violent swinging action required to hit a drive deemed most unladylike , an 18 - hole course of putting greens was built			0
the rest , as they say , is history and 150 years later people from all over the world enjoy minigolf in a wide variety of locations on courses littered with tiny waterfalls and animatronic dinosaurs			1
it might not be as famous or well - known as the full - size game -- " big golf , " as @entity24 says -- but away from the fairways and bunkers of conventional courses is a hardcore community of players dedicated to golf 's miniature cousin			1
and none are more dedicated than @entity73 , the founder of the @entity75 @entity74			1
@entity73 opened the @entity17 course in 1992 and decided to start holding tournaments			1
the first was the masters in 1997 , followed one year later by the @entity79			2
while the former is always held at @entity73 's course , the latter annually switches location , mirroring the long - established traditions of golf 's equivalent tournaments			1
and the similarities have not been lost on those at @entity89 , home since 1934 of what is now the season 's opening major tournament			2
" i 've been called three of four times by the people at @entity89 , " explained @entity73			0
" they said i was infringing on their name and stuff			0
" i said , ' how can that be ? there 's the masters of tennis , of marbles			2
you name it , there 's a masters of it			2
' " they asked me to do certain things , but they 've never said i need to cease and desist			0
" the @entity17 course -- " our @entity89 , " boasts @entity73 -- annually attracts players from across the globe for the masters , a tournament @entity24 has won in each of the last two years			1
while @entity118 took home $ 1.44 million for his @entity120 success in april , minigolf 's event has a total prize fund of just $ 12,000			1
" the season is expensive , " admits @entity24			1
" traveling to the @entity75 is expensive			1
we usually go there three weeks to a month before a tournament			2
" all prize money goes back into the travels , but i still need sponsors and my parents contribute to these trips			0
" @entity24 's commitment to the sport is unquestionable			1
not only does she fly 4,500 miles to compete in the @entity75 , she is joined by an entourage including both of her parents , her coach and , if you believe @entity73 , even a masseuse			1
" i was seven when i first traveled to the @entity75 for a tournament , " said @entity24			1
" the atmosphere was absolutely amazing			0
all the other players would stand around me and cheer , some of them screaming and jumping in the air			2
" @entity24 's fellow competitors tend to be middle - aged men who enjoy the heat of competition and the fraternity which comes with being an obscure sportsman			1
however @entity73 admits that some find losing to a teenage girl difficult to take			0
" they 've known her since she was seven years old , so they all like her , " said @entity73			2
" but at the same time they want to win too			0
and they do n't like it when some girl beats them ! " but the response to @entity160 is almost entirely positive , with @entity75 's minigolf courses a home away from home for the prodigy			1
" when at a tournament , it really feels like we are one big family , " said @entity24			1
" we see each other regularly , at least twice a year , and we know each other			0
the players ' community is very supportive , i do n't feel much rivalry			0
" i have once beaten the same player in sudden - death playoffs three times in row			0
he was a little upset and walked away briskly , but even then , he later came back and offered his congratulations			0
" and that was the only time i could feel any sort of over-competitiveness			0
" as minigolf continues to grow , the sport 's family could welcome more and more foreign members , with players from far and wide flocking to tournaments across the globe			1
" @entity192 is seeing a rise in player numbers , clubs and events and greater recognition of @entity39 as a sport , " its sport director @entity190 told @entity0			0
" there are now 46 member nations in the @entity39 , with @entity201 and @entity202 our most recent members			0
" with over 1,300 tournaments played each year , including @entity207 , @entity208 and @entity209 , there are now 38,000 registered players competing in a wide range of tournaments			1
" for @entity24 , more major titles surely lie in wait			1
after all , she has won two green jackets before her 19th birthday , two more than 14 - time major winner @entity23 had at that age			0
and @entity24 has set her sights on a showdown with " big golf 's " biggest star			2
" we have challenged @entity23 on several occasions , mainly through the media , but he never responded			0
maybe he is afraid ? ! " she joked			0
over to you , @entity23 ... @entity0 's @entity226 contributed to this story .			0
