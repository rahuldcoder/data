-- legs covered in skin - toned stockings , her skirt crisp to the knee , @entity1 slips on the black heels she has shined for the day			2
" got to look good in the @entity13 's house , " she says as she spritzes her neck with @entity10 perfume and exits her black @entity11			0
@entity14 , 46 , of @entity15 , @entity16 , has attended @entity18 churches since before she could crawl			0
she sits proudly in the pew every sunday for service and is among the first to arrive for bible study each wednesday			0
she moves swiftly , with confidence , a weathered @entity22 clutched in her right hand , the day 's passages dog - eared and highlighted			0
she 's the type of woman who can recite scriptures with ease , her love of faith evident in her speech			0
" every day is a blessed day for me , " she says			0
" @entity34 is the no. 1 man in my life and any man who wants me must seek me through @entity37			0
" the unmarried @entity16 native is a committed follower of the @entity40 faith , striving to live and breathe the gospel in her daily life			0
yet , according to relationship advice columnist @entity44 , it is this devout style of belief and attachment to the black church that is keeping black women like @entity14 -- single and lonely			1
clinging to the gospel @entity51 , a writer for the @entity52 , recently made claims on her blog @entity56 that predominantly black protestant churches , such as @entity59 , @entity60 , and certain denominations of @entity62 and @entity63 churches are the main reason black women are single			1
@entity51 , who is black and says she is not strictly religious , argues that rigid beliefs constructed by the black church are blinding black women in their search for love			1
in raising the issue , @entity51 ignited a public conversation about a topic that is increasingly getting attention in the black community and beyond			2
@entity77 , among others , recently hosted a show about single black women and relationships after a @entity82 study found that 42 percent of @entity84 - @entity84 women in the @entity85 were unmarried			1
@entity86 , a predominately @entity87 in @entity88 , is holding a seminar on the question of faith 's role in marital status on august 20			0
" black women are interpreting the scriptures too literally			1
they want a man to which they are ' equally yoked ' -- a man that goes to church five times a week and every sunday just like they do , " @entity51 said in a recent interview			1
" if they meet a black man that is not in church , they are automatically eliminated as a potential suitor			2
this is just limiting their dating pool			0
" the traditional structure and dynamics of black churches , mostly led by black men , convey submissive attitudes to women , @entity51 says , encouraging them to be patient -- instead of getting up and going after what they want			1
nearly ninety percent of african - americans express " certain belief in @entity126 " and 55 percent say they " interpret scripture literally , " according to the 2009 @entity123 study " a @entity124			1
" dr. @entity127 , a professor at @entity128 and advocate for @entity84 issues , responded to @entity51 's article online			2
though he applauded @entity51 's courage to voice her opinion , he agreed -- and disagreed -- with her			2
" i do n't think the church keeps black women single , " @entity127 says			1
" but i do agree that some black churches teach women that they must only date a man that goes to church regularly			1
" @entity127 , who is @entity84 and whose father is a @entity63 minister , described his interactions with southern women who are devout churchgoers			0
" i am a male and i know that i will treat a woman well , but i have been rejected many times because i do n't thump a bible with me everywhere that i go			0
" all in the numbers one of biggest reasons black women are single , @entity51 says , is because of a lack of black men in the church			1
according to the @entity123 study , " @entity84 men are significantly more likely than women to be unaffiliated with any religion ( 16 percent vs. 9 percent )			1
nearly one - in - five men say they have no formal religious affiliation			0
" @entity127 believes the social structure of the church keeps black men from attending			2
" those appealing , high - testosterone guys have a hard time getting into the ' follow the leader , give me your money , and listen to what i have to say ' attitude			0
" " many of us have a difficult time submitting to the pastor who is just another man			0
" the male pastor , @entity51 says , is the " alpha male " for many black women			1
over-reverence for the pastor - or any religious figure for that matter - creates barriers for the black man , she says , because he feels like he must compete for the no. 1 spot in a black woman 's heart			2
" it does n't make you more attractive if your life is filled with these ' other ' men , " @entity51 says			2
" if they feel like they have to compete , you are not going to be interesting because you 're not feeding his ego in the way it needs to be fed. " @entity194 , son of a black preacher in @entity196 , @entity16 , says some black women " put their pastor on this pedestal and have a large amount of faith in him because he is a living source of salvation			1
" sometimes women even focus their romantic feelings on the pastor , says @entity194			0
" regardless if he 's married or not , sometimes human desires will transcend beyond certain parameters and that 's dangerous territory			0
pastors are humans just like anybody else			0
" the rev. @entity215 , a bible scholar who holds a degree in theology from @entity218 , strongly disagrees with @entity51 about why many black women remain single and says she is reinforcing one message : " it 's the black woman 's fault			1
" " to claim that women are sitting in their chair getting heated about watching their preacher strut across the pulpit is illogical , " @entity215 says			0
" the black church is not a sunday morning sex drama			1
" @entity215 , who is @entity84 and has written several books on women 's spirituality , has her own criticisms of the black church			1
the literal interpretation of certain scriptures can lead to subjugating women , @entity215 says			0
however , positive scripture messages , about love and justice , do exist and can be used to empower women rather than keep them " single and lonely			2
" @entity215 says @entity51 fails to examine deeper threads			2
" what the black church does and what religion does is helps you create core values for your life and allows you to see what you appreciate in others			1
" the reason why black women who go to black churches are not married is because they are looking for certain values in a man , " @entity215 says			1
" it is not the church that keeps them single , but the simple fact that good values are lacking in some of our men			2
" choose or lose the church @entity51 says her goal is to empower black women			1
if their strategy for meeting men is failing , @entity51 offers two suggestions : find another church or leave - and go where the boys go : tailgates , bars and clubs			1
" black women need to open their eyes			1
you want to know the reason why the black man is n't in church ? because he left church to go to the sunday football game , " @entity51 says			1
" going to these sites is discouraged in the black church because these places are seen as places where ' sin dwells			1
' but if women are compassionate , as the bible preaches they should be , then they need to be more open about the men they choose to date and where they might meet them			0
" " i 'm not against religion , or against the church , i 'm against women limiting their choices and putting themselves in a box because they do what their church tells them to do , " @entity51 says			2
" telling black women that they should spend their two hours on sunday elsewhere and drive them away to go to the bar to find a date is not helpful to our communities			1
" " black women are the backbones of their community and without them a lot of charitable work would not get done , social justice on the ground would be diminished and outreach to poor people would be severed			2
" @entity1 , the long time churchgoer in @entity16 , says all the arguments over what the church preaches miss the point			0
what truly matters , she says , are women 's motives			0
" the real question is : what are you coming to church for ? " she says			0
" to feed your spirit ? or your carnal desires ? " the church 's effect on the romantic lives of black women can not be gleaned from a mathematical equation or a select bible passage , @entity14 says			1
" it is a woman 's own actions and decisions that will determine the outcome of her love life , not the church 's , " @entity14 says			0
" because the last time i checked , the church ai n't no dating service			0
