@entity0 -- for a certain kind of middle - aged male , friday 's double golden anniversary , marking the premiere of " @entity9 " and the release of the @entity12 ' debut single " @entity4 " , offers an unmissable opportunity to wallow in nostalgia			1
even from a distance of half a century , there are few totems of popular culture more revered and more marketable than @entity17 and the @entity12			1
the @entity12 embodied the energy and youthful spirit of their era , yet their remarkable creativity , productivity and talent for reinvention means that much of their music still sounds fresh today , while contemporaries such as @entity27 and the @entity28 remain trapped for ever in the beat scene of the early " @entity30			2
" never before seen @entity12 photos sell for more than Â £ 350,000 @entity33 crosswalk named historic landmark @entity17 too , despite initial industry skepticism -- " it simply wo n't work in @entity40 ... ( @entity42 ) @entity41 will never go over , " one studio representative told producers @entity44 and @entity46 at the premiere of " @entity9 " -- was a perfect hero for the age of @entity51 paranoia and nuclear brinkmanship , the film 's @entity36 setting even mirroring the unfolding cuban missile crisis			1
yet under @entity44 's long stewardship , @entity17 remained a figure capable of reflecting our contemporary obsessions -- whereas a jet pack - wearing @entity41 once propelled himself across the screens of the space age , now @entity62 's taut , humorless 007 is more likely to be equipped with the latest smartphone gadgets			1
some , preposterously , have even claimed the existence of the @entity12 as evidence of a divine hand at work			0
commenting last week on the announcement that the band 's albums would be re-released later this year on " audiophile quality vinyl " , music producer @entity68 said of the band 's prolific output : " truthfully , i think of it as proof of @entity77 , because it 's beyond man 's ability			0
" predictably , both anniversaries are accompanied by a welter of other rehashed and recycled material cashing in on the occasion			0
@entity12 completists not content with the band 's already expansive canon of literature can now look forward to an anthology of @entity91 's letters and several exhaustive new reference books			2
meanwhile , the " @entity94 " musical has just opened in @entity0 and a remastered dvd edition of " @entity96 " is set to go on sale , accompanied by a serious - minded @entity99 documentary on the making of the critically derided comic caper that can easily be summed up in five letters : drugs			0
@entity17 's back catalogue also gets a 50th birthday facelift with the re-packaging of the 22 films as a @entity109 box set - though one wonders , even among hardcore fans of the series , whether there is much appetite for the sight of @entity116 creaking and wheezing his way through " @entity122 " in high - definition clarity -- a role for which even the eyebrow - raising @entity120 admits he was " 400 years too old " by 1985			2
designing 007 : exhibition marks 50 years of @entity17 @entity17 car sells for $ 4 million none of these products are presumably aimed at a generation that can actually remember @entity128 or the @entity12 in their heydays			1
the least likely upgraders to @entity109 would seem to be those old enough to have seen " @entity9 " in a cinema , just as the " @entity12 : @entity134 " console game is unlikely to have held much appeal among those who first encountered the band -- then the @entity139 's eighth most popular " small group , " according to a poll at the time -- supporting @entity142 in early 1963			1
instead , they are targeted at what could be described as " @entity145 , " intended to prod once again the pavlovian reflexes of compulsive consumer - collectors who , in an era when the concept of music and movies as something that we own in physical form looks increasingly redundant , remain one of the ailing entertainment industry 's more dependable customers			0
though not quite old enough to remember the sixties , @entity145 grew up in a world in which the popular culture of the decade resonated long after the idealism , social change and upheaval of the era had passed into the history books , and in which the @entity12 ' template of guitars , bass and drums and the @entity17 staples of stunts , super villains and seducible women had laid the foundations for rock music and the modern action movie			1
yet the problem with this conservative world view is that nothing subsequent can ever live up to the mythologized past , while other influences on the culture of our own era are belittled and ignored			0
modern pop music , after all , arguably owes more to the traditions of hip hop and dance music than to " @entity191			0
" its enduring influence is demonstrated by an outburst by @entity195 in 2008 , in which the former @entity197 star , born in 1967 , listed the top five bands of all time as the @entity12 , the @entity200 , the who , the @entity201 and the @entity203 -- according to deeply reductive criteria that included " no solo artists , no female artists , no collectives allowed ( @entity207 etc. )			2
" such blinkered reverence is at odds with the world in which the @entity12 and @entity17 came to stardom , when the spending power of neophyte teenagers dominated pop culture and a song or movie could be top of the pops or a box office hit one week and gone the next			1
no one involved in the creation of " @entity4 " or " @entity9 " would have expected that either would be anything more than quick money spinners -- a throwaway two - minute pop song and a low - budget adaptation of a cheap paperback attempting to cash in on the @entity51 appetite for espionage thrillers			0
in their own words : journalists who covered @entity91 's murder time : meeting the @entity12 @entity91 and @entity233 quickly became deeply disillusioned with life in the @entity12 , while even @entity235 , now strip - mining his own back catalogue in stadiums around the world , spent years attempting to step out of the band 's shadow			1
similarly , @entity41 in a 1965 interview with @entity242 complained that being typecast as @entity17 had become " a bit of a bore			0
" yet the @entity12 remain the band that we ca n't live and let die , doomed to be recycled as fading photocopies of the original with every incremental improvement in music technology and significant anniversary until one day we can all look forward to high - definition holograms of @entity12 performing " @entity253 " in our living rooms			2
similarly with @entity17 , while it 's easy to put out new editions of the old classics or to recycle familiar plots in updated settings , can anyone say they genuinely expect " @entity263 , " the 23rd installment due to be released later this month , to bring anything new to the series ? fifty years is a long time , even by the standards of the rise and fall of nations , but in the ever changing world ( in which we live in ) of pop culture both @entity17 and the @entity12 should long ago have been passed over to the custody of historians for safekeeping			1
with the release of their albums once again on vinyl , the @entity12 ' music will have turned full circle , returning via tapes , compact discs , minidiscs and mp3s to the format where it all began			2
perhaps that 's an appropriate moment , finally , to let it be			0
opinion : @entity17 on @entity287			0

friday marks the anniversaries of first @entity17 film premiere and release of @entity12 ' debut single
for some this offers an unmissable chance to wallow in nostalgia , says @entity297
but @entity297 believes we should n't dwell too much on the past
perhaps it 's time to leave the sequels and re-releases behind , he says
