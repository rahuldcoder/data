-- below ground in central @entity2 is a bunker every self - respecting golfer is desperate to find -- even international man of mystery @entity6			1
just yards from the plush shopping paradise that is @entity9 sits @entity10 , a subterranean sanctum that has been teaching and preaching about the game for over 60 years			1
it 's in the bowels of this grand @entity16 building on @entity17 that actors as diverse as @entity19 , @entity20 , @entity21 and @entity22 have honed their swings			1
but you are just as likely to find taxi drivers and heads of industry popping in for a lesson -- or a brisk round at @entity30 or @entity31 on one of the school 's simulators			0
" golfers today , unfortunately , are no better than they were back in 1951 when the school opened , " @entity35 , who along with @entity36 has more than 35 years of @entity10 service under his belt , told @entity0			1
" people do n't come here for the location or for the facilities -- they come for the lessons			0
" founded by pioneering swing coach @entity45 back in 1951 , @entity10 thrives through word of mouth , welcoming around 300 new disciples each year on the strength of its tutelage			1
it 's this reputation that explains why so many a-list stars have made a pilgrimage to the salubrious district of @entity54 , often in a hurry to grasp the basics of the game ahead of a big - screen project			0
golf philosophy it was here the original 007 -- @entity19 -- came to fine - tune his game before filming " @entity67 " in the mid- 1960s , the third in the series charting the intrepid adventures of @entity65 's dashing secret agent			1
@entity70 's finest -- with the help of a few underhand tactics -- gets the better of his nemesis @entity67 on the golf course , in a famous scene that also includes the decapitation of a statue via the boot of the international jewel thief 's menacing butler @entity76			1
" @entity19 was n't a golfer before the film and at the time he was seeing a dentist called @entity81 , then an @entity83 amateur champion , taught by @entity45 , " @entity35 explains			1
" he told @entity84 , ' if you want to look like a golfer in a few short months you should go and learn from @entity45			1
' " a golf pro who had identified all the critical components of a successful swing , @entity45 believed the game was best taught inside , away from the worst of @entity83 's elements			1
he set up shop in a disused squash court in central @entity2 -- miles from any golf course -- and despite next to no advertising , it was soon packed to the rafters			1
@entity45 's method is still the one favored by @entity35 and @entity36 , aided by modern technology , and is still as effective in teaching the film stars of today as it was half a century ago			1
" we did a similar thing last year for @entity21 for a film he was making called ' @entity105 , ' " @entity35 adds			2
" he was a great pupil , very intense			0
" we 've been looking online to see if we did any good for @entity21 in the few lessons he had and we found the trailer			2
" in the first clip @entity21 is playing a shot out of bunker that looks fantastic			2
it 's not a double , it 's him			0
he looks like a golf professional			0
" perhaps another reason @entity10 has endured is its abiding philosophy , breaking what can be a complicated game down into simple , manageable elements			2
golf can be a veritable goldmine of misinformation and incomprehensible jargon , but the straight - talking stalwarts of @entity10 attempt to help chart a path to consistently straight driving			1
" the reason people come here is to try to find an end to trial and error golf , " @entity35 says			0
" most golfers do n't know what they do when they hit a good shot , or a bad shot			0
" the only way you can progress is by knowing where you should be at each and every stage of your swing , by mapping out the swing			0
" i 've been teaching golf for 30 years and i ca n't understand most of the golf stuff i read			1
people come here and say , ' i wish i 'd done from the start what you 've shown me in just a few minutes			0
' " the great beauty of the swing we teach here is we look at some of the modern players like ( 2010 @entity158 winner ) @entity159 or ( reigning @entity161 champion ) @entity160 , and all the positions they make are identical to the ones we teach all the time			0
" golf addiction one of @entity10 ' biggest supporters is film star @entity20 , who has spent hours in @entity54 grooving a swing that is regularly put to the test in celebrity golf tournaments around the world			1
he once said of his love of the game : " my golf addiction is out of control			0
i literally want to play from the moment i get up to the time i go to bed			0
" @entity35 added : " @entity20 is a great supporter of ours ; he 's done more for us than anyone			2
he did the introduction for one of our books , which we ca n't thank him enough for			0
" @entity20 and his father have both regularly been to @entity10 for lessons , and the actor 's testimonial takes pride of place on the company 's website			1
" it is hard to say which of us came to you the worse golfer , but you have done the impossible and turned us from embarrassing into respectable , " it reads			0
not everyone who walks through the doors of 47 @entity17 has what it takes to improve their game , though			0
one pupil especially still has a cherished place in the school 's history , even though his inexperienced wielding of a club nearly took out the head honcho			0
" @entity45 once had a guy come in who was the only person he told he could n't help , " @entity35 says			2
" it was a @entity215 who came down and said he wanted to play golf			1
" @entity45 stood opposite him and the guy took the club back and swung it round at head height			2
@entity45 had to duck before his head came clean off			0
" when asked to have another go , the guy did exactly the same thing , at which point @entity45 took the club off him and said , ' i 'm sorry , sir , golf is not for you			2

@entity10 has been teaching amateurs and a-listers for over 60 years
@entity19 , @entity20 , @entity22 and @entity21 among the pupils
@entity84 learned to play golf before starring as @entity6 in the movie " @entity67 "
situated in the heart of @entity2 , @entity10 was founded by *ex-golf* pro @entity45 in 1951
