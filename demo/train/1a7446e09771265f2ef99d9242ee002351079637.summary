president @entity0 flatly stated tuesday the @entity1 wo n't forget the gruesome killing of @entity1 journalist @entity3 and promised " justice will be done			1
" and now , apparently , he has some options to pursue such justice -- going after @entity7 not just for beheading @entity3 , but for its campaign of terror around the region			2
the @entity14 has given @entity0 " a range of planning options " to go after the @entity18 terror group , @entity13 spokeswoman @entity12 told @entity20 's @entity19 on tuesday			1
that includes continuing to strike the group , as @entity1 forces have done for weeks , inside @entity24 as well as taking the fight into @entity26			1
" we 're having a constant conversation inside the administration about what options could be necessary to go after @entity7 whether it 's in @entity26 , @entity24 or wherever they train or operate , " the spokeswoman said			1
@entity12 added that the president -- who has authorized reconnaissance flights over @entity26 , according to a @entity1 official -- has n't made any decisions on what to do next			1
but , even if he has n't offered specifics , he has n't backed down in his rhetoric			0
speaking at an @entity42 event tuesday about @entity3 's killing -- which @entity7 videotaped then put online as it threatened more such killings targeting @entity1 -- @entity0 said that , while his government will be patient , it also wo n't hesitate to use its vast reach to bring " justice " by going " after those who harm @entity1 " and others			1
" we 'll continue to take direct action where needed to protect our people and to defend our homeland , " the president said in @entity53 , @entity54			1
" and rooting out a cancer like ( @entity7 ) wo n't be easy , and it wo n't be quick			2
but tyrants and murderers before them should recognize that kind of hateful vision ultimately is no match for the strength and hopes of people who stand together for the security and dignity and freedom that is the birthright of every human being			0
" officials : @entity1 fighting for @entity7 killed in @entity26 official : @entity1 wo n't coordinate with @entity77 @entity1 officials take pains to point out that they are going after @entity7 already			1
militarily , that means increasing its presence in the @entity84 , boosting intelligence gathering and cooperation in @entity24 , doing more for @entity24 security forces and conducting airstrikes in @entity24 , @entity14 spokesman rear adm. @entity80 said tuesday			0
still , if the @entity1 is serious about going after @entity7 -- wherever it is -- it ca n't count on the group to stay on the @entity24 side of the porous @entity26 border			1
that 's why striking in @entity26 is a possibility			0
if that 's what happens , it would mean @entity0 would be on the same side as @entity26 president @entity98 -- the same man who @entity1 officials have been railing at for years , going so far as to work closely with the " moderate opposition " forces trying to unseat him the past three years			1
yet these " moderate " forces are n't alone in trying to topple @entity77			0
they 've been joined by -- and sometimes fight against -- @entity7 and other groups such as @entity106 , that @entity107 calls terrorist organizations			0
@entity26 foreign minister @entity109 said @entity77 's regime was ready to accept support from the @entity1 and others working under the @entity114 umbrella to fight " terrorists " -- a reference to @entity7			1
but @entity109 warned against any unilateral action or strikes in @entity26 territory without permission			2
@entity12 said tuesday , though , that @entity1 officials wo n't be suddenly befriending or working with their counterparts in @entity26			2
quite the contrary , she said , stressing " we are not going to be coordinating with the @entity77 regime , period			0
" " the answer to @entity7 is not the @entity77 regime , " the @entity13 spokeswoman said			2
" they have allowed them to grow ...			0
and we are not going to be working with them to root out this threat			0
" in fact , @entity12 said @entity0 is asking @entity132 to fund a " training and equip mission " for the " moderate opposition in @entity26			2
" this could be significant , as up until now the @entity1 government has resisted giving arms or military equipment directly to anyone in the war - torn country who wants to defeat @entity77 -- in part due to fears such weaponry could end up in the wrong hands , including that of @entity7			1
" it is always a challenge that we 're dealing with , " @entity12 said			0
" we believe here , though , that we need to keep supporting the moderate opposition in @entity26			0
" officials : non-military ways to defeat @entity7 the key to defeating @entity7 is n't necessarily as simple as military might , @entity1 officials say			1
yes , airstrikes could block the @entity18 terror group 's offensive , though they would n't necessarily eliminate them entirely if fighters move underground			0
" it does n't take too many people around you getting blown up to make you not want to get out into the open , " said retired col. @entity161 , an ex-aide to former cia director gen. @entity163			0
from a funding and manpower standpoint , @entity12 said it 's important to cut off funding for @entity7 and its supply of foreign fighters like @entity173 , the @entity1 killed in fighting in @entity26 over the weekend			1
there is also a gut decision of what to do when faced with a terror threat : after beheading @entity3 , for instance , @entity7 promised to kill more @entity1 so long as they were targeted			2
@entity80 , the @entity14 spokesman , said that " you ca n't let yourself be intimidated by a group like this			0
" you ca n't count on convincing them either , though it is important the local people understand that they are better off without @entity7 than with them , he added			2
" they will respond to force , " @entity80 said of what military action can do			0
" but ultimately what 's going to defeat them is a rejection of their ideology			0
and that can only be done through good governance -- in @entity24 and @entity26			1

@entity13 official : cutting off funding , foreign fighters for @entity7 is key
@entity14 official : military power is effective , but so is local " good governance "
@entity1 official : @entity14 has given @entity0 options on what to do in @entity26
president @entity0 on @entity7 : " we 'll continue to take direct action "
