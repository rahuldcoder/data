-- the @entity1 , better known as @entity1 , may be an airborne virus , according to an observation paper published tuesday in the journal @entity5			1
there have been 836 laboratory - confirmed cases of @entity1 infection since its first appearance in 2012 , according to the latest numbers provided by the @entity12			1
at least 288 related deaths have officially been reported to the @entity12			0
scientists are still trying to figure out how the deadly virus is transmitted			1
@entity16 reports big jump in @entity1 cases researchers from @entity20 in @entity16 collected three air samples from a camel barn			1
previously , they had found mers in a camel from that barn and in its infected owner , who later died from the condition			2
after analyzing the air sample , the scientists found one strain of @entity30 , the viral genome			1
interestingly , the barn air tested positive for @entity1 on the exact same day that one of the nine camels in the barn tested positive for @entity1			1
also , the virus from the air sample was identical to the virus found in nasal samples from the infected camel and its owner			2
" these data show evidence for the presence of the airborne mers in the same barn that was owned by the patient and sheltered the infected camels , " the study authors write			0
but does that mean @entity1 is easily transmitted through the air ? " what they say is that virus particles can be airborne , but it 's premature to conclude that @entity1 is transmitted through aerosols , " said dr. @entity50 , a professor of pathology , microbiology and immunology at @entity54 in @entity55 , @entity56			1
the key point is the difference between dead virus particles and a viable virus			0
" i could take billions of particles of dead viruses and could still find the rna			0
that does n't mean that there are infectious aerosols , " @entity50 said			0
@entity73 , a senior research scientist at @entity74 , agrees on that distinction			0
" we know that @entity1 is found in nasal secretion of camels , so virus particles being spread out in a barn is not a surprise , " he said			1
" whether or not you can get infected , and if it 's a cause for concern , is still an open question			0
" however , previous studies have suggested that there must be a way @entity1 is shed into the environment			2
several reports in the past have shown @entity1 infection of those in close contact with infected patients			1
the exact pathways of infections are unclear			0
" do we still need to consider the possibility of airborne transmission ? yes , of course , " @entity50 said			0
but in order to fully understand whether airborne transmission plays a role in @entity1 , further research is needed , @entity50 and @entity73 conclude			2
@entity108 man did n't have @entity1 , @entity106 says			0

there have been 836 confirmed cases of @entity1 infection
scientists are trying to figure out how @entity1 is transmitted
researchers in @entity16 found @entity117 in barn air
