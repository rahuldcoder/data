after years of speculation and rare case reports , a study suggests that stimulant medication -- mostly used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder -- may have played a role in a handful of cases of sudden , unexplained death in children and adolescents			1
untreated adhd can lead to poor school performance and increase adolescents ' risk for harmful behavior			0
the study authors stress , however , that parents and doctors should not refrain from treating children with @entity11 just because of these results			1
" the association is significant in that it 's real , but that does n't mean it 's not a very low risk , " says lead author @entity21 , @entity22 , a professor of psychiatry and public health at @entity26 , in @entity27			1
" there probably does need to be more careful monitoring , but the bottom line is that parents should not take their children off stimulant medication they 're currently on and should not be scared to have their child go on a stimulant if that 's what they and their doctors decide is the best thing for their child			1
" the study , published this week in the @entity47 , is the first to suggest that the stimulants may pose a risk -- albeit remote -- in children without underlying heart problems			1
about 2.5 million children in the @entity53 take such medications			1
stimulants linked to 1.8 percent of unexplained deaths @entity21 and her colleagues compared medical records and parent interviews of children and adolescents who had died between the years of 1985 and 1996 , including 564 who had died from an unexplained heart - rate abnormality or other causes , and 564 who died as passengers in motor vehicle accidents			1
they excluded cases with other known possible causes of death , such as asthma or congenital heart diseases			0
of all the unexplained cases , the researchers found that 10 children , or 1.8 percent of the group , had had stimulant medication prescribed			1
this compared with only two cases of stimulant use , or 0.4 percent , among healthy children who had died in motor vehicle accidents -- a group used to represent a general population of healthy children and adolescents			2
@entity88 : treatment options for adhd at any age in all 10 cases , the children were taking methylphenidate , the active ingredient in @entity96 and @entity96			0
a similar drug , @entity98 , is composed of mixed amphetamine salts and was not included in the study results because it was first approved in 1996			0
however , the @entity101 in 2006 asked the manufacturers of stimulants , including @entity98 , to add a warning to their label saying the medications should not be used in children with structural heart abnormalities or other heart problems			1
at the time , the @entity101 advisory panel rejected a more stringent black - box warning about the possible risk of sudden unexplained death			1
@entity114 , another medication approved for adhd in children , is not a stimulant medication			2
a spokesperson for @entity120 , which distributes and markets @entity96 , says the company welcomes any data that add to the body of knowledge in this therapeutic area , but did not make a specific comment on the new study			2
@entity130 , a spokesperson for @entity131 , the manufacturer of @entity96 , notes that the drug has been used for more than 50 years and is the most studied @entity11 medication			2
@entity88 : secrets to a stress - free home " for all of its products , @entity131 reviews its global safety and efficacy through post-marketing surveillance and consistently reports new information to health authorities on an ongoing basis , " says @entity130			0
" review of @entity131 safety data has failed to detect an increased risk in sudden cardiac death associated with methylphenidate use			0
" not a watershed moment , researchers say @entity21 says it 's important to report this association , but she is also concerned about the results being misinterpreted			0
" we 're very sensitive to not wanting this to be some watershed moment where stimulant medications start to get used less and get used inappropriately , " she explains			2
in an editorial accompanying the article , @entity161 , @entity162 , and @entity163 , @entity162 , of the @entity164 , agree with @entity21 's concerns			0
@entity88 : the top 5 cholesterol myths they write that the study findings " should underscore that stimulant medications are not innocuous and that their therapeutic use requires careful diagnostic assessment , diligent safety screening , and ongoing monitoring			1
" however , it is equally clear that sudden , unexplained death is a rare event , this is only the first such study , it relies on small numbers , and it is not possible to quantify the risk beyond estimating that it is very small			2
" indeed , since a double - blind , placebo - controlled trial is n't ethically possible in this situation , it is hard to conduct a study that 's not without flaws			2
although the researchers are confident that the results are not due to any underlying factors -- children with @entity11 often have asthma and heart conditions also linked with sudden death , and so these cases were eliminated from the analysis -- " one can never be 100 percent sure that there are n't other unknown or undiagnosed issues , " says @entity21			1
@entity88 : slideshow : celebrities with @entity11 @entity198 , @entity162 , a professor of pediatrics at @entity200 and @entity201 , says the study is n't surprising " nor particularly convincing			1
" he says the research is flawed because , among other problems , it may have underestimated the number of children who were taking stimulants			0
the rate of stimulant use , particularly in the accident - related deaths , was lower than expected , he says			1
" the study adds very little to what we already know , i.e. , that some children who receive stimulants experience sudden unexpected death , " says dr. @entity198 , who was not involved in the study			2
" the current study should not change the use of any medications or treatments			2
" more research , careful monitoring is needed stimulant medications currently contain a warning targeted to specific high - risk children , including those with structural heart defects , cardiomyopathy , or heart - rhythm disturbances			1
the medication labels also warn that stimulants may raise blood pressure and heart rate , and have been linked with stroke and heart attack in adults			0
when deciding whether to put a child on stimulant medications , both clinicians and parents should weigh the seriousness of the situation , says @entity21			1
the benefits may not outweigh the risk in cases in which attention problems may be keeping a b - student from becoming an a-student , she explains			2

untreated adhd can be harmful in itself , leading to poor performance in school and increasing adolescents ' risk for harmful behavior such as reckless driving , unsafe sexual practices , and substance abuse			0
" i have two boys , now grown , so i can certainly relate to parents facing these decisions , " @entity21 says			0
" if my child was having problems to the extent that a neurologist or psychiatrist was recommending medication , i would want the medication -- although , even though we did n't discuss this specifically in the study , i would want my child to have an ekg			0
" in 2008 , the @entity279 recommended that doctors consider routine electrocardiograms before starting children with @entity11 on stimulants or other psychotropic medications , but underscored the need for future research			1
an ekg may help to detect cardiac abnormalities that would increase a child 's vulnerability to sudden heart problems			0
parents considering stimulant medication for their children should also provide their doctor with a detailed family history , including any heart problems or sudden deaths of close family members			1
future research should focus on new ways to detect which children are most at risk for sudden death when taking stimulants , says @entity21 , since not all cases seem to be detectable with routine screenings			0
until then , a thorough examination and careful monitoring is the best way to reduce a child 's danger			0
the study was funded by a grant from the @entity164 and a contract with the @entity101			0

study : stimulant meds , often used in @entity11 , may have role in kids ' deaths
authors warn parents not to stop treating kids with @entity11 ; risk is low
stimulant meds currently contain a warning targeted to specific high - risk children
about 2.5 million @entity53 children take such medications
