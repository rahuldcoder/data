-- the conventional wisdom , among most folks , anyway , is that buying a used car is usually something done out of necessity , by those on a budget -- that is , people who want , or need , to " move down " from the new - car market because a new model is simply out of their reach			1
bottom line , the @entity15 reputation is for high - end luxury , quality and long - term dependability			1
however , there is another category of used cars that appeal to those with a bit more disposable income : used luxury cars			1
for some buyers , the used - luxury market is a way of getting into that @entity15 , @entity30 , @entity31 or @entity32 you always wanted , without laying out $ 70,000 or $ 80,000 for something you 're not actually going to live in			1
for others , scouring the used - luxury - car listings is a way of re-visiting the halcyon years of their youth			1
at this point , some of these used - luxe models have been around so long that they almost qualify as vintage throwback editions			1
recently , @entity45 magazine issued its list of best and worst used cars , and divvied them up by price range			1
