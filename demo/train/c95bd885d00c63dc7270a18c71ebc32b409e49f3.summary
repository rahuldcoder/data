it 's a modern day gold rush			2
a trip to @entity3 in @entity4 will cost even the most discerning fans thousands of dollars , while providing a hefty windfall for business owners riding one of the biggest consumer spending weekends of the year in the @entity10 @entity12 models hosting $ 25,000 tables , shady ticket deals , and risky online trading for @entity3 seats have become as much a part of the annual celebration of @entity10 's favorite sport as the ceremonial opening coin toss			1
with so much at stake , many fans wo n't be leaving anything to chance in the race to book luxury hotels , limos , and some of the year 's most lavish parties -- not to mention , tickets to the big game itself			1
as a result , a throwback solution from pre-internet days has emerged as a winner : the hospitality package deal			2
" it 's a value - add situation , " says @entity35 , owner of @entity37 - based @entity36 , who sold out of her few remaining @entity3 packages last friday			1
" hotels are just not available , " she says , explaining that there is extra demand for four and five - star accommodation over the weekend because of the @entity44 , a four - day @entity45 tournament featuring @entity46 , which concludes on @entity47			2
for @entity36 clients , drinking can start as early as at 11.30 a.m. on game day with a " @entity52 " that includes an open bar and buffet that lasts until kickoff at 3.30 p.m. understandably , a premium is placed on hassle - free transportation from the resorts of @entity59 to the @entity60 , a 40 - minute drive away			2
" people want to have some fun ; they do n't want to be the designated driver , " she explains			0
" they just want the whole thing taken care of and guaranteed			0
yes you can do it yourself , but a lot of people choose not to			0
" working her 15th @entity3 since starting her company as a student at @entity74 in @entity37 , @entity35 reserves blocks of hotel rooms in @entity3 cities 12 months in advance			1
she has already launched her search for rooms in @entity81 , in preparation for @entity3 50 , to be played in nearby @entity83			1
providing that scarce availability , along with a game ticket , provides an advantage over hotel booking sites , she says			0
at this late stage , the basic package deals left on ticketing site @entity91 begin at $ 6,000 for one ' @entity92 ' ( i.e. nosebleed ) @entity3 ticket , four nights at a three - star hotel , game day shuttles , and pre-game festivities			1
the quote is per person based on a double occupancy room			2
singles start at $ 7,000 and airfare is not included			0
the cheapest @entity3 " get - in " price on ticket aggregator @entity104 at the time of writing stands at $ 3,507 , valuing the add - ons and convenience of a package deal at $ 2,493 per person			1
seventy percent of @entity36 's clients are corporates , many of whom have asked for golf tee times and @entity45 tickets to be lumped onto their deals			1
the remaining batch encompasses ' bucket listers ' looking to attend any @entity3 , international fans ( mainly @entity122 ) , and of course , rabid @entity125 and @entity126 supporters who waited to see whether their teams would qualify ( only the highest spending season ticket holders are allotted seats to the big game )			1
then there are the partiers ; lots of them			0
the concept of staging bachelor party - themed events leading up to the @entity3 began over 10 years ago and has taken on a new realm of competition			1
each year , the likes of @entity140 , @entity141 , and @entity142 try and outdo each other to attract the most famous bands , models , and personalities to their parties , granting access at eye - watering prices			1
" the saturday night before the @entity3 is really when everyone wants to go out , " says @entity35 , adding that the @entity142 party is often at the top of her corporate clients demand list			1
" it 's a guy - based event , absolutely , " she says , about the bash which advertises 24 @entity142 bunnies mingling with guests , while the rapper @entity157 plays master of ceremonies			1
all tickets include an open bar and buffet			2
but what else could make the $ 850 entrance fee worthwhile ? " you can use your imagination , " she says			0
" there are lots of girls in there and lots of drinking			0
" " every superstar player that 's not appearing in the @entity3 will make a [ paid ] appearance at one or two of those events prior to the game , " says @entity176 , who organized the @entity178 @entity3 victory party in @entity4 in 2008			1
" imagine a nightclub two nights before the @entity3 with nothing but multimillionaire young athletes competing on what they spend , " he adds			1
" it 's just champagne and sparklers everywhere			0
" this year 's hot ticket is the @entity140 party , with performances by @entity195 of @entity196 and @entity197			0
tickets start at $ 1,045 and hit $ 56,238 for a @entity200 table on @entity201			0
the @entity12 hosted leather and @entity204 party starts at $ 495 for a lounge seat , climbs to $ 2,500 for a meet and greet with the likes of @entity208 and @entity209 , and hits $ 25,000 for a ' @entity210 ' ( includes 14 tickets , 10 bottles of premium liquor , and three bottles of @entity215 )			0
although @entity176 stresses that soir√©es attended by a-listers are closed to the paying public , some parties advertised as invite - only are anything but			2
general admission tickets to " @entity224 's @entity223 - only bash , " featuring a performance from @entity226 , are offered on vividseats.com for $ 970			1
while arranging tickets to parties is usually a straightforward process for agencies ( promoters offer them first dibs ) , procuring @entity3 tickets is another issue entirely			1
@entity35 says she sources some tickets via corporate sponsors , but declines to reveal exactly how she fulfills the remainder of her ticketing obligations			2
forging ties with those who have access , along with playing the secondary ticket market ( tickets resold online at prices that fluctuate based on supply and demand ) , are two methods , according to @entity248 at @entity104			2
" a lot of the teams cut deals with ticket brokers and sell their tickets in advance , " he says , pointing to a controversy last year when the @entity251 and @entity125 both sold @entity3 tickets to @entity252			1
" it 's not something that teams want people to know that they are doing , particularly teams that have qualified			0
" in addition , @entity264 says many agents work the secondary ticket market speculatively , like stock traders			0
without holding inventory , they will enter agreements to sell tickets in the two weeks leading up to the playoff semifinals			0
once the @entity3 opponents are determined , prices normally fall by over $ 1,000 in the two weeks leading up to game day , @entity264 says			2
the drop allows agents to cover their end of the deal by purchasing cheaper tickets closer to game time at a healthy margin			0
the trend has been consistent over the last four years , according to data provided by @entity104 , which places a value score on tickets available across the web			0
during this year 's run - up , however , market forces have worked the other way , pushing the average sold ticket price up 40 % from a week earlier to $ 4,126 , potentially leaving risk - takers in turmoil only days before the @entity3			1
the wiliest brokers , however , eschew market speculation for less scrupulous means			0
" it 's not uncommon to hear stories of agents with briefcases full of cash flying down to @entity4 to buy @entity3 tickets in hotel lobbies off of players , " says @entity264 , noting that every @entity299 player and coach is allotted two @entity3 tickets to purchase at face value			1
reselling the tickets for profit is against @entity299 rules , a violation for which former @entity312 head coach @entity311 was fined $ 100,000 in 2005			0
@entity264 advises fans to wait until a few days before @entity3 sunday to make their purchases , when last minute deals can often be procured			1
@entity176 suggests the same to party goers : " once you get there and your boots are on the ground , you can negotiate better deals for sure , " he says			0
for some fans , competing for the best deals off the field is part of the fun			0
most , however , would prefer to revel in what @entity4 has to offer and leave the strategizing to the professionals .			0

tickets for sunday 's @entity3 final trading for thousands of dollars
corporate customers and ' bucket listers ' willing to spend high for luxury package deals
" @entity346 - based events " and *vip* parties fuel excitement for those with deep *pockets*
