-- last year , dr. @entity1 , a cardiologist in @entity2 , was fired two months after presenting strong data showing that cardiologists in the hospital she worked at misread a substantial number of heart tests			0
similarly , a nurse from @entity10 of @entity11 ( @entity12 ) was let go after complaining that a doctor was performing unnecessary cardiac procedures , even after an internal investigation found the nurse 's claim to be substantiated			2
and a few weeks ago , the @entity18 " @entity19 " reported on @entity21 doctors fired for not meeting quotas on the percentage of patients they admitted to the hospital			2
these recent patterns of firings send yet another strong message to every doctor and nurse who has ever considered speaking up about dangerous and fraudulent medical care : speak up and risk destroying your career			1
the culture of health care needs to change			2
medical mistakes cause too many needless harm or deaths , yet few people see the problem in this context because we rarely have an open and honest conversation about the quality of health care in @entity11			1
when we do , it is often behind closed doors			0
this is a challenge that a new generation of doctors is working to change through initiatives ranging from more transparent bedside care to public reporting of hospital performance			1
doctors and nurses increasingly feel disconnected from policymakers and even their own hospitals , some of which have transformed into giant corporations			1
despite concerns from the @entity62 that costs will go up for consumers , hospital mega-mergers are on the rise			2
this past year saw a large number of hospital mergers and acquisitions in health care			2
while some hospital executives have commendably used a hospital chain 's large size to standardize best practices , others have fallen into the age - old management trap of detaching themselves from the front lines and becoming dangerously out of touch with their own staff			0
i talk to doctors and nurses around the country every week			1
one trend that seems clear is that more doctors and nurses are feeling frustrated			2
a recent national study by @entity89 researchers shows that doctor burnout rate is now up to a staggering 46 %			2
a new phenomenon , quite different from when my father practiced medicine , is that doctors and nurses now say they feel like they are tenants working for their landlord : the hospital management			1
often , doctors and nurses know how to make care better and safer but feel stripped of the power to make necessary changes			1
this worker - management disconnect ( even antagonism ) in any industry is dangerous			0
in medicine this workplace atmosphere , complicated by perverse economic incentives and weak systems of accountability , contributes to a hospital culture marked by a lack of a sense of communal ownership in the overall delivery of care			1
what results is a poorer quality of care , more overtreatment , more fraud , more medical mistakes , and more patients falling through the cracks			1
according to a 2009 @entity18 - @entity123 poll , 77 % of @entity11 say they are satisfied with the quality of their health care			0
but what makes people think the health care they 're receiving is good ? very little			0
a @entity131 study published in the @entity132 reported an alarming fact : 18 % of patients were actually harmed by medical care			1
the @entity136 estimates that up to 30 % of health care procedures , tests and other services do not improve health outcomes			0
for instance , if you had a medical condition , would you go to a hospital that has performed more than 1,000 unnecessary procedures ? probably not			0
as much as one - third of all health care expenditures may be going to waste , fraud and unnecessary medical care			1
this problem is high on the agenda for the @entity151			0
other physician groups have joined the " @entity153 to address unnecessary care in @entity11 medicine			0
the @entity156 is calling attention to the problem , and many medical researchers are speaking openly about it			0
but more needs to be done			0
rather than reinforce a closed - door culture in @entity11 medicine , hospitals should use their new large size to encourage external and independent peer reviews and create a culture of transparency			0
patients should be encouraged to keep a copy of their medical records , not inconvenienced with burdensome processes and extra charges to obtain them			1
a hospital 's front - line health care workers are their work engine , and these people should be encouraged to voice their safety concerns to their managers			1
mega-hospitals need to stay true to their mission and not fall into the large corporate pitfalls that can erode the standing of any business			0
a workplace culture that punishes those who speak up about problems by depriving them of their career livelihood is part of the problem itself			0
as a surgeon , i sometimes see patients after they have blindly walked into the hands of dangerous , expensive and avoidable care			0
if we are serious about improving health care quality and lowering costs , we need to address the issue of accountability			1
our hospitals must be more accountable to patients and doctors			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity206 .			2

@entity206 : doctors who talk about fraudulent medical care risk losing job
@entity206 : doctors increasingly feel disconnected with policymakers and hospitals
he says some hospitals are becoming *mega-corporations* with little accountability
@entity206 : doctor should be encouraged to voice safety concerns to their managers
