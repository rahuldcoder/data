-- @entity1 evokes a variety of expectations			1
some look forward to a romantic dinner or a special gift , while others treat it like any other day			2
whatever the case , how you approach this nationally recognized " holiday " reflects your expectations within your relationship , experts say			1
" it varies from couple to couple , but usually the way you feel about it is a metaphor for your expectations of the relationship , " said family psychotherapist @entity15			1
if someone 's more easygoing and has low expectations , it says something about his or her ability to be flexible and adaptable , she said			1
on the other hand , if a husband expects the wife to surprise him with dinner at a restaurant he 's secretly dying to go to , it shows that he sets the bar high in the relationship and expects her to deliver , @entity15 said			1
it does n't hurt to use @entity1 as an opportunity to step up your game and show you care , but do n't let the relationship live or die based on this day alone , she said			1
" the affirmation and declaration of love is not in a gift or in one day			2
it 's a 365 - day year experience of feeling like your partner has an interest and desire to know your wants and comfort level			1
" what couples do also tends to evolve depending on the stage of the relationship			1
@entity0 's team of feature writers and producers solicited feedback from @entity60 and beyond on how folks plan to observe @entity1 , if at all , with bonus information on nontraditional relationships			1
young love for new couples , @entity1 is a good opportunity to set the record straight as far as expectations , with an open , honest discussion , which could help determine whether the relationship 's going to work , @entity15 said			1
among our @entity60 friends , that means dinner or drinks at a place they 've been dying to try			2
a card , candy , or a thoughtful gift might be involved to let your partner know you 're serious			2
if @entity1 occurs early in the relationship , the female tends to expect more from the guy , and he 's probably stressing out over the situation , said @entity85 , " the @entity86 , " who coaches people in matters of the heart			1
" when you 're first starting a relationship , there 's always that fear factor involved because the guy does n't want to disappoint the girl , but he but does n't want to do something over the top that 'll scare her off , " @entity85 said			1
the @entity100 ( double - income , no kids ) married or not , this ai n't their first rodeo , and they tend to know what they want out of the evening			2
plus , having no kids means more time , money and flexibility to do whatever you want			2
to us , it kind of seems like the best situation for doing something for the holiday , as it elicited the most diverse responses			0
for some , it meant date night at @entity120 or steak frites and a night in a hotel			0
a friend who 's a vegan chef is making a special meatless meal for her sweetie , complete with chocolate cookies with raspberry jam centers			1
@entity129 managing editor @entity128 says she and her husband buy each other scotch or @entity133 wine , and he cooks the same meal every year : steak ( the first year , it was heart - shaped ) , pattypan squash , hen of the woods mushrooms			0
another constant : " there is never a restaurant involved			0
" when money is tight , a bouquet of flowers does the trick , one friend said , as they 're " cheaper than jewelry and healthier than chocolate			0
" speaking of thoughtful and unhealthy , one person who flew home from a conference in @entity154 brought a deep - dish pizza back to her significant other			0
married with children children might change priorities in a relationship , but that makes @entity1 the perfect opportunity for a couple to reclaim some time just for themselves , @entity15 said			1
" many people who 've been married for a long time can get lazy and stuck in a rut and do n't want to take the energy and initiative , " she said			0
" if there 's no time to get away , after the children go to sleep , plan to be together and not in pajamas and take the time to make good eye contact and commit			1
" things are a bit different for one friend now that he and his wife have a toddler			0
but he still writes a poem for his wife and they make handmade gifts for each other			0
another friend and her husband have cut back on dinners out since the birth of their daughter and purchasing a new home , but they still exchange cards			0
the long haul eventually , the children grow up and leave the nest , if all goes according to plan			0
for some , it 's an opportunity to reclaim life as a couple			1
dinner and flowers are generally a part of the celebration , with special enhancements when possible , said a relative who lives in @entity206			0
in recent years , the couple have spent weekends in @entity209 , @entity210 , and @entity211 , @entity212			2
the husband bought a picture for his wife of two people walking in a park together that reminded him of them			0
" all the more special since i gave it to her on @entity1 , " he said			1
" still my favorite picture			0
" nontraditional relationships not every relationship fits into one of those categories , but that does n't mean nontraditional lovers do n't want to celebrate their relationships just like the rest			2
take , for example , polyamorous " families , " which consist of multiple romantic partners , from as few as three to north of 20 in some instances			0
" each of my partners is like those in any monogamous relationships , " said @entity236 , a representative of the @entity237 , which provides members of the press with information and spokespeople on how polyamory works			0
" there 's really no difference between how i feel about my current partners or how we relate to each other			2
the only difference is i did n't have to break up with one to start the other			0
" @entity236 , her three male partners and their additional " metamors " are going out for dinner at a nice steakhouse in @entity259 , @entity260			0
all told , there will be six of them around the table			0
" i do n't personally observe @entity1 , but my partners ' other partners do , " she said			1
" the holiday 's not important , but making my loved ones feel that i care about them is important			2
