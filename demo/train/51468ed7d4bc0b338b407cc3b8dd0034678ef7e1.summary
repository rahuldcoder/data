@entity0 -- the @entity3 administration announced wednesday that it will begin sending condolence letters to the next - of - kin of service members who commit suicide , said a @entity9 statement			2
" this issue is emotional , painful , and complicated , " president @entity3 said in the statement			2
" but these @entity12 served our nation bravely ... we need to do everything in our power to honor their service , and to help them stay strong for themselves , for their families and for our nation			0
" the move comes nearly six weeks after a group of senators -- 10 @entity22 and one @entity24 -- asked president @entity3 to change what they called an " insensitive " policy that dates back several administrations			1
@entity12 sen. @entity28 led the bipartisan group and was pleased with the administration 's policy change			2
" this will ... do a great deal to reduce the stigma surrounding mental health treatment that prevents so many from seeking the care they need , " she said in a statement wednesday			1
the lack of condolence letters in instances of suicide has been the subject of protest by some military families			0
" it 's bittersweet , " said @entity46 , father to @entity48 spc. chancellor @entity47 , who killed himself while serving in @entity49			2
" it does not bring our son back , but i think it does send a powerful message that mental health in our military can be addressed			1
" @entity1 first reported in 2009 about the family of @entity48 spc. @entity47			1
the family set up a wall to pay tribute to @entity47 in their @entity63 home			0
along with his uniform and the flag from his burial service , a space was left for the expected condolence letter from the commander in chief			0
upset when they learned a suicide did not merit a letter from the president , @entity46 wrote to the president and the @entity48 chief of staff requesting the policy be changed			1
he argued that his son 's suicide was a result of what he was exposed to during war and that it deserved to be considered caused by battle			0
" they did n't die because they were weak , " said the president 's statement			0
" and the fact that they did n't get the help they needed must change			0
" according to an @entity48 report last year , annual suicide rates in the @entity94 and the @entity48 -- the two branches most involved in combat operations in @entity49 and @entity97 -- increased steadily between 2004 and 2009 , to more than 20 per 100,000 people			1
during that time the rate for those two branches surpassed the age - adjusted , national civilian average , whereas suicide rates for the @entity104 and @entity105 stayed below the national average			1
in 2001 , the suicide rate among @entity94 , like the @entity104 and @entity105 , was about half the civilian rate , and the @entity48 's , while higher than the other three branches , was still below the civilian rate , according to the @entity48 report			1
@entity1 's @entity111 contributed to this report .			0
