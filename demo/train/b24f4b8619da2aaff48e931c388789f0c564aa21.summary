-- a 13 - year - old @entity2 boy is suing a private residential school for discrimination after it refused to admit him because he has @entity5 , his attorneys said			1
the eighth grader , whose name was n't disclosed in a federal lawsuit filed in @entity10 , alleges that the @entity15 in @entity16 , @entity2 , " violated multiple anti-discrimination laws that protect the rights of people with @entity5 to remain free from unwarranted discrimination			1
" chocolate maker @entity17 and his wife , @entity19 , founded the school in 1909			1
the school provides a cost - free education and coeducational home for pre-kindergarten through 12th grade students who come from a low - income family , the lawsuit said			0
the youngster sought enrollment last february for this school year , the lawsuit said			2
the boy is an honor roll student and a student athlete , and his medication of five pills per day and one vitamin would n't impact his school schedule , the suit says			0
executive director @entity38 of the @entity39 of @entity2 , which is representing the boy and his mother , likened the case to @entity43 , who died at age 18 in 1990 and had been expelled from middle school when his @entity5 diagnosis became widely known			1
" like @entity43 , this young man is a motivated , intelligent kid who poses no health risk to other students , but is being denied an educational opportunity because of ignorance and fear about @entity5 and @entity54 , " said @entity38 , an attorney for the boy and mother			1
the suit , filed wednesday , was timed to coincide with thursday 's @entity57 , the law project said			1
@entity38 told @entity0 that she was " stunned that in the third decade of @entity54 ( @entity15 ) still thinks it is too dangerous to admit a student who is @entity5 positive			2
it really shows how far we have n't come			0
" in response , the school said it had been intending to seek a federal court review of its decision denying enrollment to the boy , but the law project " took the adversarial action of filing a lawsuit against the school , " said spokeswoman @entity72			1
" we believe we made the right , legal decision under the law , " @entity72 told @entity0			1
" the decision to deny enrollment was a challenging one for us to make			0
like all our enrollment decisions , we need to balance our desire to serve the needs of an individual child seeking admission with our obligation to protect the health and safety of all 1,850 children already in our care , " @entity72 added in a statement			0
@entity72 said the case is nothing like @entity43 's			0
" @entity15 is not a day school , where students go home to their family at the end of the day			2
instead , this is a unique home - like environment , a pre-k -12 residential school where children live in homes with 10 - 12 other students on our campus 24 hours a day , seven days a week , " @entity72 said			2
" in order to protect our children in this unique environment , we can not accommodate the needs of students with chronic communicable diseases that pose a direct threat to the health and safety of others			0
we are serving children , and no child can be assumed to always make responsible decisions which protect the well being of others , " @entity72 said			0
