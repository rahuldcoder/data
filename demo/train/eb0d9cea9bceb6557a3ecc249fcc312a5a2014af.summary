-- sometimes , it pays to read between the lines			0
at least that may be the message -- and , more accurately , the hope -- of workers at the @entity7 office in @entity8 , @entity9			1
the message can be found in an official forecast put out at 5 a.m. ( 9 a.m. et ) that seems , at first glance , routine with its discussion of air pressure , wind speeds and weather systems			1
but if you line up the first letters of each word from top - to - bottom in the forecast , under the heading " analysis and @entity25 levels , " there 's something else there : @entity28 - a - s - @entity30 - a - @entity29 that breaks down into three simple words : please pay us			1
meteorologists at the service 's @entity8 office declined friday afternoon to comment on the possibly cryptic wording , saying they can only speak about weather - related matters			1
it was not immediately clear who exactly put out the forecast or whether a message was intentionally tucked into it			2
still , it 's no secret that @entity7 employees -- like other federal government employees -- are n't getting paid as long as the government is shut down			1
that began tuesday and there has been no indication that it will end anytime soon , with @entity51 and @entity52 holding firm on their positions that the other is to blame and that they wo n't budge			0
up to 800,000 federal workers are at risk of furlough , meaning they wo n't report to work until the sides agree on a spending plan that president @entity61 signs into law			0
other federal employees are still working , because what they do is considered essential by the government			2
that includes many at the @entity7			0
whenever the shutdown ends , these government workers should get back - pay			2
but there 's no telling when that will happen , meaning they could work for days , weeks or months before they take home a paycheck			0
@entity0 's @entity74 contributed to this report .			0
