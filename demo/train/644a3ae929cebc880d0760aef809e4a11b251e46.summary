the words " welcome to @entity1 " are etched on two wooden boards , nailed to a pair of poles stuck in the grassy @entity6 prairie			1
with wildflowers immediately to the front , a dirt road yards away and a few stray buildings and trees in the distance , the sign seems appropriately simple for the tiny town			2
yet in the last few weeks , @entity1 has become anything but simple			1
@entity16 wants to transform the town 70 miles southwest of @entity18 into a community that mirrors his white supremacist views			1
he did so quietly at first , asking residents whether their land was for sale			0
but recent reports from the @entity25 and the @entity26 exposed his mission and turned it into a national story			0
in an interview with the @entity25 , @entity16 said he hoped his plans in @entity1 would " excite " white people and " give them confidence because we 're being deracinated in our own country			1
" " we 've been very , very tolerant about these major sociological changes , " he said , according to the paper			0
stuck in the middle is @entity1 's lone black resident , @entity38			1
he 's known @entity1 as a nice , peaceful place where " everybody got along , we basically could leave our doors unlocked , and there was no fear that nobody wanting to harm us			1
" thanks to @entity16 , @entity38 now feels under threat , and he said his townsfolk do , too			0
" if he ca n't love his fellow man , then we ask @entity50 to help him with something , " @entity38 said friday about @entity16			0
" because i 'm not very happy , and the people in this town are n't very happy			1
" @entity1 is part of @entity55 , which according to its official website is @entity6 's third largest county by land mass at more than 1 million acres			1
while the communities once buzzed with activity from nearby railroads , nowadays it 's decidedly more quiet			2
that certainly was true of @entity1			1
the @entity64 says it has a population of 16 people , though other estimates run higher -- though not beyond 25 residents			2
among them is @entity38 's wife , @entity70			1
her mother grew up in @entity1 and , today , she and her husband call it home			1
" i have roots in this town , " she told @entity74 's @entity73 on friday night , alongside @entity38			1
" i have a reason to be here			0
" @entity79 recalls running into @entity16 last year and he asked her if she had property for sale			0
she said no. @entity38 said @entity16 asked him the same question			0
" he has the audacity to even ask me for information to buy land , and his intentions were to harm my way of life ? " he said			0
" ... that 's very , very uncomfortable for me			2
" how successful was @entity16 , who is wanted in @entity90 on hate speech charges , in buying up the town ? the @entity93 say that residents have been overwhelmingly supportive of them			2
but the @entity26 notes that white nationalist @entity95 and her husband claimed , on an online message board , to have property in the town			1
so , too , has @entity102 -- commander of the @entity104 , which he describes as the " largest pro-white organization " in the @entity106 " involved in the struggle for white civil rights			2
" in an open letter to @entity1 mayor @entity111 , @entity109 announced that he and members of his group would be heading to @entity1 on september 22 and 23 with " a simple message that @entity16 will not be ousted from the community			1
" " @entity16 is not breaking any laws or ordinances , and has a right to reside in @entity1 just as any other @entity106 does , " @entity109 writes , just before mentioning how he owns an old meat packing / creamery building in town			1
he adds later , " if anything , you should see this for what it is , a chance at revitalizing a community			0
" these comments have been echoed on white nationalist online message boards such as @entity130 and @entity131			1
posters there have applauded @entity16 for " doing a great job " and jibing critics as " laughable , pathetic what this country has come to			0
" the @entity93 have felt their wrath , including a letter they received friday that read , in part : " i want you to leave your " husband " and go join mr. @entity16 's movement			0
do it now ! separation of the races forever ! " the target of that missive , @entity149 , says that 's just one of many she 's received calling her a " filthy , race - mixing white woman " and " pea - brained			2
" " it made me afraid , " she said			0
" if his goal is to just have only white people here , where do my husband and i go ? " @entity70 has nothing but kind words for her neighbors , but that does n't mean she knows what to do or how this story will end			2
she admits , " i think we 're unsure as to what to do			0
we 'll just have to wait and see			0
" @entity16 said his friends have bought or acquired some of his plots , but he does not know when they will move to the town			0
@entity174 town accused of keeping apartheid alive			0

@entity1 , @entity6 , is a town of a few dozen people , only one of whom is black
@entity181 has been trying to turn it into a white nationalist community
the town 's lone black resident and his wife feel *threatened* and uncertain
