editor 's note : business insider is contributing a series of columns to @entity5 that challenge commonly held beliefs about the tech world			2
( @entity8 ) -- here 's the truth about @entity11 's wireless network : on the whole , despite what you 've heard , it 's not actually that bad			1
it 's just bad for the wrong people in the wrong places -- mostly tech - and media - types in @entity20 and @entity21 , @entity22			1
those two cities in particular -- and parts of other big cities , like downtown @entity26 , @entity27 -- are sort of the perfect storm for @entity11			2
there 's a huge concentration of @entity32 , owned by tech - and media - savvy folks who demand a ton of bandwidth , and love to complain loudly on @entity37 and in the press			1
and there are tall buildings , landlords and construction processes that make running a wireless network more challenging			0
that helps explain why there are so many dropped calls and pokey mobile internet connections in those cities , and also why there are so many angry tweets and news articles			0
and that 's why even @entity54 ceo @entity53 has come to @entity11 's side , defending how his partner has tried to beef up its infrastructure in its most troubled markets			1
at a recent press event , @entity53 said that when @entity11 wants to add a cell tower in @entity63 , it may only take three weeks			2
but in @entity21 , on average , it takes three years			0
" no one wants a cell tower in their back yard , but everyone wants perfect reception , " @entity53 said , according to a rough transcript			0
the rest of the country , overall , is n't such a mess for @entity11			0
how can we tell ? one way is to look at @entity11 's customer turnover statistics to see if people are fleeing from @entity11 and its supposedly terrible service			1
the reality is that they are not			0
during @entity11 's second quarter , its monthly " churn " -- the percent of customers who leave every month -- was 1.29 percent			1
if you exclude prepaid subscribers , who tend to switch carriers or discontinue their service more often than average , @entity11 's monthly churn was even lower , at 1.01 percent			1
those are both record lows for the company and represent improvement over the same period last year			0
how do those stats compare to the rest of the wireless industry ? you 'd think that @entity100 -- whose network has a stellar reputation compared to @entity11 's -- would have much , much lower churn			1
@entity100 customers are indeed more loyal than @entity11 's , but barely			1
its monthly churn last quarter was 1.27 percent , only a hair below @entity11 's			1
if you exclude prepaid subscribers , it was 0.94 percent -- again , better than @entity11 's , but not by much			1
for comparison , @entity109 was almost twice as bad , and @entity111 was more than twice as bad as @entity11 and @entity100			0
if things were that bad at @entity11 -- and comparatively , that much better at @entity100 -- you 'd expect a greater difference in their churn rates			0
another recent study leans in @entity11 's favor			1
a 3g wireless performance test carried out by @entity118 showed that @entity11 's network was almost always faster than its competitors , and that its reliability was on par. both measurements showed significant improvements over its 2009 tests			1
but indeed , @entity11 's performance and reliability in @entity20 and @entity21 were n't as strong as in other cities , such as @entity129 , @entity130 , or @entity131 , @entity132			1
anecdotally , i 've noticed similar things traveling around the country with an @entity137 and @entity138 - enabled @entity136			0
last weekend in @entity140 , my 3g connection seemed much snappier than it typically does in @entity20			0
i was even able to stream a @entity142 video to my @entity136 in a moving bus -- something i ca n't even do reliably when i 'm stationary in @entity145			0
@entity11 pours billions of dollars -- between $ 18 billion and $ 19 billion this year alone -- into trying to improve its network			2
for example , it 's going cell site by cell site to add more bandwidth to support faster speeds , a process that will continue through this year and next , an @entity11 spokesman says			1
many of the carrier 's improvements have focused on @entity20 and @entity21			1
for instance , @entity11 has doubled the capacity of its network in @entity20 over the past year , and is in the process of doubling its capacity in @entity21			1
it has also installed specialized indoor systems in high - traffic areas , including @entity164 and @entity165 in @entity20			0
as a result , mobile download speeds in @entity20 are up 31 percent over the last six months , according to internal testing data			2
blocked calls are down almost 40 percent in @entity145 so far this year , and dropped calls are down 23 percent , @entity11 says			0
the company has also complemented its strained 3g network with more free wi - fi hot spots for its customers , including a network recently installed in @entity20 's @entity176 , one near @entity177 in @entity26 and all @entity179 locations			2
in addition to adding 400 percent more 3g capacity at @entity182 in @entity21 , it has also doubled the number of wi - fi hot spots there			2
in those situations , the idea is that customers could hop on @entity189 to send emails or access the @entity191 , taking a load off cell networks			0
to be sure , despite these improvements , the company obviously still has a lot of problems in @entity20 and @entity21			2
and because of the concentration of tech and media industry types there , we 'll probably see the " @entity11 sucks " rants and " attfail " tweets for the foreseeable future			2
at least until @entity100 gets @entity54 's @entity137			0
then we 'll know if this whole mess is really @entity11 's fault or just the unique situation of having to support millions of @entity137 in use at one time			1
but in reality , things are n't as terrible for @entity11 as you 've been led to believe			0
it 's just really bad in the wrong places , for the wrong people			0
