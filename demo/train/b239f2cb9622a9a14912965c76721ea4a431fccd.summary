@entity0 , @entity1 -- the @entity5 did not know about an @entity7 priest believed to have molested up to 200 boys until 20 years after civil authorities investigated and then dropped the case , its top spokesman said thursday			1
@entity5 spokesman father @entity11 issued the statement in response to a @entity15 story alleging that top @entity17 officials , including the future pope @entity18 , failed to discipline or defrock the now - deceased rev. @entity19 of @entity20 , despite warnings from several @entity7 bishops			1
but @entity23 , a lawyer who obtained the internal church paperwork the newspaper based its story on , said it " shows a direct line from the victims through the bishops and directly to the man who is now pope			1
" @entity11 rejected the accusation			2
" during the mid- 1970s , some of @entity35 's victims reported his abuse to civil authorities , who investigated him at that time , " @entity11 said			1
" however , according to news reports , that investigation was dropped			1
" the @entity5 's @entity42 , the office led by cardinal @entity18 , who would later become pope , " was not informed of the matter until some 20 years later , " @entity11 said			1
the office is in charge of deciding whether accused priests should be given canonical trials and defrocked			2
" the case of @entity51 has been well - documented since the mid- 1970s , when allegations were first reported to civil authorities , although criminal charges were not filed , " the @entity47 of @entity48 said in a statement thursday			1
" @entity19 's actions were criminal , and we sincerely apologize to those who have been harmed			2
the @entity47 of @entity48 continues to reach out to victims - survivors who were harmed by @entity51 and encourages them to report any abuse they suffered			2
" @entity23 , a lawyer representing five men who are suing the archdiocese , obtained correspondence from @entity48 to @entity18 as part of the lawsuit , along with other internal church documents related to the case			1
the documents , dating to 1974 , include letters between bishops and the @entity5 , victims ' affidavits , the handwritten notes of an expert on sexual disorders who interviewed @entity19 and minutes of a final @entity5 meeting on the case			1
@entity19 began as a teacher for @entity80 for the @entity81 in @entity82 , @entity20 , in 1950 , and was promoted to run the school in 1963 in spite of the fact that students had warned church officials of molestation , according to the documents , which @entity2 has seen			1
many of @entity19 's victims were hearing - impaired			2
@entity18 failed to respond to two letters about the case in 1996 from @entity48 's then - archbishop , @entity93			1
after eight months , cardinal @entity95 , who at the time was second in command of the doctrinal office and now is the @entity5 's secretary of state , told @entity20 bishops to begin a secret canonical trial , the documents show			1
@entity11 said that church rules did not mean a priest would automatically be punished but that punishment , if warranted , could include being defrocked			2
" in such cases , the @entity105 does not envision automatic penalties but recommends that a judgment be made not excluding even the greatest ecclesiastical penalty of dismissal from the clerical state , " he said			0
" in light of the facts that @entity35 was elderly and in very poor health , and that he was living in seclusion and no allegations of abuse had been reported in over 20 years , the @entity42 suggested that the archbishop of @entity48 give consideration to addressing the situation by , for example , restricting @entity35 's public ministry and requiring that @entity35 accept full responsibility for the gravity of his acts , " the statement said , noting that @entity19 died four months later			0
three successive archbishops in @entity20 were told of the abuse , but none reported it to criminal or civil authorities , according to @entity23 , the lawyer			1
@entity11 , however , said that neither canon law nor @entity17 norms prohibit the reporting of such cases to law enforcement			0
but " he did not address why that had never happened in this case , " the @entity15 said			2
the @entity47 of @entity48 said abuse was reported in fall 1973 to @entity48 police , who turned the report over to @entity82 police , but no charges were filed			0
@entity19 was removed in may 1974 as director of the @entity80 for the @entity81 but remained as fundraiser and alumni director until summer 1974 , when he was removed from any role at the school , according to a chronology posted on the archdiocese web site			0
in august 1974 , a series of newspaper articles in the @entity154 reported on @entity19 's removal and the allegations , the chronology said			0
in september , he relocated to a family home in the @entity158			0
a district attorney reviewed the allegations against @entity19 in fall 1974 , according to the archdiocese			0
a civil lawsuit was filed in 1975 against the archdiocese relating to @entity19 but was resolved the following year , the chronology said			0
@entity19 's request for retirement was accepted in january 1993 , but restrictions against him were reinstated that year and reinforced twice			0
the bishops warned the @entity5 , according to the newspaper , that failure to act on the matter could result in embarrassment to the @entity173			0
" the tragic case of father @entity51 , a priest of the @entity47 of @entity48 , involved particularly vulnerable victims who suffered terribly , " @entity11 said in the statement			1
" by sexually abusing children who were hearing - impaired , @entity35 violated the law and , more importantly , the sacred trust that his victims had placed in him			0
" in the late 1990s , after over two decades had passed since the abuse had been reported to diocesan officials and the police , the @entity42 was presented for the first time with the question of how to treat the @entity19 case canonically , " the statement said			1
at the time , there was no procedure in place for reporting church abuse to the doctrinal office , according to @entity5 sources			0
the office was informed of the matter , @entity11 said , because it involved abuse at confession , which is a violation of the @entity197			0
@entity80 for the @entity81 closed in 1983 , the archdiocese said in its statement			0
" most importantly , today , no priest with any substantiated allegation of sexual abuse of a minor serves in public ministry in any way in the @entity47 of @entity48			2
" @entity2 's @entity206 contributed to this report .			0
