@entity0 , @entity1 -- when @entity4 gave birth to octuplets in january 2009 the news was greeted with amazement around the world			1
but astonishment soon gave way to criticism directed at her -- it was revealed that she was already a mother to six children -- and over the ethics of fertility treatment			1
so far she has weathered the storm and soon her eight babies will be celebrating their first birthday			2
but how on earth does she cope ? " the children sleep all night , " she told @entity2 's @entity22			1
" they sleep maybe from 7.30pm to 5am , but there are not enough hours in the day			2
" caring for octuplets -- six boys and two girls -- poses a unique economic challenge for the 34 - year - old mother of 14 who has also been criticized for being jobless			1
" it 's a challenge			0
it 's a double - edged sword			0
i 'm damned if i work and i 'm damned if i do n't			1
i ca n't work a nine - to - five job because that 's not going to be enough income to support the kids			1
i 'm trying to secure what i can			0
" @entity4 says trying to manage the domestic budget is like " a revolving door of expenses			1
every dollar that comes in goes on the kids			0
" " @entity4 " -- as she has been dubbed by the media -- does have some help with the child - rearing from three helpers , one of which is dedicated to looking after her child who has autism			1
inevitably , it is impossible for her to give each child the attention they deserve			0
" it would be impossible for a couple			0
you just try and do the best you can			0
you try and have special time with each child -- putting them to bed , telling them a story , asking them about their day -- as long as they get alone time and it 's quality			2
i 'd love to give them quantity but that 's virtually impossible			0
" despite her experience with fertility treatment @entity4 is reluctant for across the board limits on the number of embryos that can be implanted during @entity80 treatment			1
" every case is subjective , every woman responds differently , " @entity4 said			1
" given my past reproductive history my doctor did n't make any kind of mistake , he was guided by what was successful in the past			1
so only a certain amount of embryos were transferred -- the same amount when i had my twins			2
the last thing anyone imagined was more than one or two growing			0
" although the burden of raising 14 children is obvious , @entity4 is reluctant to jump into a relationship			1
she is n't in a rush to find a male role model for her children			2
" i believe i do not have to put myself out there			0
i do not have to date			0
i feel the missing piece of the puzzle will be placed naturally when the time is right			0
i do n't see the point in going out and wasting precious time and energy that i need for my kids			2
" @entity4 is currently documenting the experiences of the past year in a book and despite the constant sniping from the media she still manages to reflect positively on the past 12 months			1
i 've definitely grown more in the past eleven months than i have in the past 34 years			1
i personally believe everything happens for a reason and i 've learnt how strong i am			0
it 's a choice who you let into your life and who you are going to allow to affect you psychologically or emotionally			2
i 've learned how to maintain boundaries and how to grow as a result of some extraordinarily challenging situations			0
