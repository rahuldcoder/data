@entity0 , @entity1 -- with a new armed threat breathing down its neck , @entity1 's discordant government made a snap announcement on tuesday -- elections will be held in just over a month			1
the move was intended to stem a spike in violence that has prompted the @entity12 military to ramp up preparations for a possible emergency evacuation of the @entity15 in @entity0			1
just two days prior , armed men claiming allegiance to a newly formed movement called the @entity19 stormed parliament and announced they had suspended it			1
the declared goal of the @entity19 is to eradicate @entity23 militants from @entity1 , including @entity24 -- the group blamed for the september 11 , 2012 deadly attack on the @entity12 consulate in @entity27			1
nearly 80 people have died in less than a week in battles initiated in the name of the @entity19			0
why it 's all gone so badly wrong politics and bullets but the effectiveness of any solution involving an election is sure to find doubters in @entity1			0
only 1.3 million out of an estimated 3.4 million eligible voters are registered to vote , according to @entity1 's elections commission			2
during the country 's last election in february , only 14 % of eligible voters participated , and boycotts and violence spoiled polls in some cities			0
the budding military alliance is a reflection of the political deadlock in @entity1 , which has increasingly pitted @entity23 against those who oppose them			1
their squabbles have paralyzed government , hindered elections , foiled security efforts and cost the interim administration its legitimacy in the eyes of many @entity1			2
after the raid on parliament -- known as the @entity61 -- its speaker , an @entity23 , called upon a large @entity23 militia to take up the fight			2
gunfire from the skirmishes that followed crackled through @entity0 for nearly two days			0
four people died and 90 were wounded , health officials said			0
turmoil in @entity1 : fighting sweeps across @entity0 following violence in @entity27 new military force still , it was much less bloody than a battle in @entity27 last week led by retired gen. @entity75 , who first declared the existence of the @entity19			1
@entity75 's men launched a land and air offensive against the @entity27 bases of @entity24 and @entity23 groups with ties the government in @entity0			1
the resulting battle killed 75 people and wounded 141 more			0
@entity75 was once a general in the @entity1 army under dictator @entity87 but had a falling out with him and emigrated to the @entity12 , where he lived for almost 20 years			1
he returned in 2011 to participate in the revolution to overthrow @entity87			0
he has criticized the government for not getting a grip on violence , particularly from @entity23 groups , and has called for the government in @entity0 to be removed from power			1
he has named his campaign against @entity23 militias @entity94			0
militants have attacked foreign diplomats , westerners , @entity1 journalists , activists and judges , but they have aimed most of their violence at government security forces with nearly daily bombings , kidnappings and assassinations			0
establishment army clout many of those who have declared alliance with @entity110 come from the ranks of @entity1 's army , including well - respected officers , and they have been on war footing with @entity23 militias already			1
members of secular militias have also joined the @entity19			0
the central government has vehemently objected to @entity110 's offensive , but the retired officer , who fought to overthrow former dictator @entity87 , vowed to not stop until @entity1 is " purged " of extremists groups			1
it 's unclear whether there was any coordination of the attacks in @entity0 and @entity27 by forces claiming loyalty to the @entity19			1
but their common enemy is clear : @entity1 's @entity23			2
@entity12 prepares evacuations as violence spread early this week , the @entity12 military doubled the number of aircraft standing by in @entity135 if needed to evacuate the @entity15 in @entity0			2
about 250 @entity138 plus seven @entity139 and three @entity141 planes were in place , just in case , a @entity137 spokesman said			0
no decision has been made to close the embassy , he said , but one of the lessons of the @entity27 incident that killed the @entity12 ambassador and three more @entity12 citizens was the " need to be more agile			2
" @entity2 's @entity151 reported from @entity0 ; @entity152 wrote in @entity153 ; @entity2 's @entity154 contributed to this report .			0
