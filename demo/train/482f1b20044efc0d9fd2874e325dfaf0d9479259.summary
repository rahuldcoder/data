-- when 12 - year - old @entity2 went to lunch each day last year , he could choose between orange juice and milk , but he could n't get a cup of water			1
like many public schools , his does n't provide cups			1
to have free water with his lunch , @entity2 would have to wait in line at a water fountain shared by hundreds of other middle - school students and take a few sips of water before returning to eat			1
not surprisingly , he usually did n't bother			0
his mother , @entity18 , like other parents across the country , assumed her child had enough water , but nutrition advocates believe schoolchildren 's access to water is a national problem the federal government has only begun to address			1
fifteen percent of kids in @entity2 's age group consume adequate amounts of water , according to the @entity32 's @entity31			1
" since children spend a large percent of their waking hours at school , they should be consuming at least one - half their total water intake at school , " says dr. @entity33 , @entity34 's @entity35			1
" the standard recommendations are for children to get 6 - 8 glasses of water per day			1
teenage boys need even more , 11 glasses per day , " she says			0
" mild dehydration can affect learning as well as mental and physical performance			0
" change you can drink last year @entity56 continued with her " @entity59 ! " campaign to target childhood obesity , former military leaders warned that obesity could be a threat to national security and the @entity64 series " @entity69 " attempted to show @entity65 what their children are eating in school			0
on the heels of those headlines , @entity70 passed the @entity73 in december to improve school nutrition in the @entity75			1
the legislation requires that clean water be easily available in school			1
advocates welcome the new legislation but say it 's not clear if the new rules will go far enough to address the lack of hydration			2
according to the new federal law , school districts will have to provide water in student eating areas , but the law does n't discuss accessibility			1
@entity91 outside @entity92 has approximately 1,700 students and four water fountains in the student eating area			2
it 's still to be decided if a school with those numbers -- 1,700 students , four water fountains and a 30 - minute mealtime -- satisfies the new legislation			1
" as part of the @entity73 , the @entity101 will be engaging in a dialogue with schools and communities as we develop a proposed rule to implement this provision of the law , " the @entity101 says			1
where we are now schools face a variety of challenges when trying to provide something -- water -- that @entity65 take for granted			1
one such challenge : drinking cups			0
advocates say , and many educators admit , that too many of @entity65 's largest school districts elect not to provide cups			1
@entity126 in @entity127 does not			0
@entity128 , in @entity129 , says drinking cups are n't provided unless a student asks for one			0
in the @entity134 @entity133 , the largest school district in the country by number of students , cups are " generally available to all students , " but spokesperson @entity139 can not say in which of its schools cups are available only upon request			2
@entity146 in @entity147 says it does not provide cups of water and there is usually one water fountain in student eating areas			2
educators say that providing cups can get expensive and take too much of their already dwindling school budgets			2
another issue is the water fountains themselves			2
some schools , advocates say , do n't have enough to handle the number of students			2
at other schools , the fountains are old , do n't work or work poorly			2
according to the @entity165 , filling cups is " likely a slow process at most water fountains			2
" other barriers to student hydration include poor - tasting water and fears that municipal tap water is not safe			2
sitting down with water " water fountains are n't providing adequate hydration , " says @entity174 , senior advocate of the @entity165			2
" when have you ever gone to a restaurant and been encouraged to go to a water fountain for a sip between bites of your meal ? " the @entity184 / @entity183 for @entity185 , a @entity32 - funded prevention research program , has been test - driving a way to get children drinking more water at mealtime to help combat @entity65 's obesity epidemic			1
it 's called a water intervention -- a five - week research program that includes a water filter and cups for five schools in the @entity92 school district , provided free from the @entity184 / @entity183 project			1
the test includes these steps : install a water filter in the school			2
fill five - gallon jugs			0
place in the eating area during mealtime			0
the results will not be published until next year , but anecdotally , the program is a success , researchers say			0
" we 've seen students really gravitate towards the water out here and fill up their cups right before and after lunch to hydrate " says @entity213 , the project manager			2
" the water is very popular and we have a lot of participation			0
" now that the research has ended , it 's up to the school district to continue funding if it so chooses , but the @entity226 says it can not afford the estimated $ 1.8 million to $ 2.3 million annually it says it would cost to provide the cups and water for the entire district			1
free drinking water and cups could also decrease revenue from bottled water sales			0
" if students drink free water served at school instead of purchasing competitive beverages that fund extracurricular activities , schools may have to seek alternative fundraising strategies , " said a report published in the journal @entity236			1
the report was based on @entity32 - funded researchers ' interviews with school personnel and families , primarily within the @entity92 school system			0
research shows that making water more accessible to children at school increases consumption of water and improves health			0
researchers in @entity257 found that by installing a cooled , filtered water fountain with plain or optionally carbonated water , providing children with water bottles , educating them on the importance of drinking water and encouraging them to fill up their water bottles , they were able to reduce the risk of children becoming overweight by 31 %			0
those children were allowed to store their water bottles at school			0
when children have to take their water bottles home , they start forgetting to bring them back , and water consumption declines , according to a pilot program in a @entity92 school			0
what the school district wants @entity278 , deputy director of @entity92 school district food services , would like the federal government to help pay for water instead of only mandating that water be made available			1
when schools serve children milk , they receive money from the federal government reimbursing them for that milk ; when schools serve orange juice , the same			1
but water is not a reimbursable beverage , either from the tap or from bottles			0
@entity278 says that has to change			0
" it 's an unfunded mandate , " says @entity278			0
" if the federal government let us offer water as part of a reimbursable meal , then the children , many of them , instead of taking a milk or juice , would take a water			1
" @entity307 , an eighth - grader at @entity91 , says having free water available in cups during the @entity184 / @entity183 research program changed her drinking habits			0
" i would n't really drink water because it 's sort of hard to be eating your meal and then stop and go drink water at the water fountain , " she said			1
" before , i would just drink whatever they have at the cafeteria , like juice or milk , and now i drink water in the cups that 's available			1
" the ' @entity324 , ' updated students have been drinking water from water fountains for decades , but research shows that children are not getting enough water throughout the day			0
" @entity331 maybe has always been insufficiently available , but schools have a unique and special responsibility to create an environment that makes it easy for students to make good choices , " says @entity174 of the @entity165			0
" the environment has changed in so many ways in recent decades , sweetened beverages are cheap and widely available and heavily promoted , family mealtimes are fewer , and briefer , and convenience foods are a much more common part of youngsters ' routines			0
" at @entity91 , principal @entity346 says she will do her best to keep cups of water in her school , even suggesting she might pay out - of - pocket to provide cups for her students			1
she would n't be the first school administrator to provide school supplies from her own wallet			0
" i see how much the kids really like the water , " she says			1
" it is documented that if we provide the choices for them they will really go for it			0

parents assume water at their kids ' schools is a given , but access is a problem
