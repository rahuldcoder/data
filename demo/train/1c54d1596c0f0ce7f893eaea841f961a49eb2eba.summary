most of the @entity2 fighters waging a guerrilla war against the regime of president @entity5 are ill equipped -- short on guns , ammunition and with no heavy weapons			1
but while peaceful opposition to the government has grown in the city of @entity14 since the summer , military defectors , who call themselves the @entity10 , have now managed to kick @entity5 's forces out of one neighborhood and hold the area			1
@entity14 is now possibly the first place in @entity2 beyond government control			1
one freelance journalist and filmmaker -- who is not named for his own security -- has just left @entity14 , and @entity23 is showcasing what he saw on the front lines of a city at war			1
