it 's one of the most influential offices in a building full of partisan bickering and mudslinging -- and its leader is supposed to rise above politics			0
the @entity10 director 's term is up in less than two weeks and recent reports indicate @entity12 wo n't give @entity14 appointee @entity13 another four years leading the office charged with projecting the cost of bills			1
instead , @entity12 may look to pick a successor whose numbers will better jive with theirs			0
the potential shake - up comes as @entity12 -- including influential @entity22 chairman @entity21 of @entity23 -- push to change how the office makes its calculations			2
rather than having the office crunch the numbers on new policies based on the current economic landscape , @entity12 would like to employ a method called " dynamic scoring			0
" this approach takes into account people changing their behavior based on the policy changes , which the @entity12 feels will make it easier to push for tax cuts			0
that 's because under " static scoring , " tax cuts show up in the budget simply as a revenue loss			2
but under dynamic scoring , the @entity10 would theoretically take into account @entity12 arguments that such cuts would stimulate economic growth and as a result either pay for themselves or create even greater tax revenue down the road			2
and the stakes are high when it comes to other highly debated policies			0
over the next two years , @entity54 is expected to debate everything from the budget to immigration reform , and will rely on the @entity10 to estimate the costs			2
those numbers can drive the political debate , as they are highly cited in the media and by politicians seeking advantage			0
plus , there 's @entity65			2
@entity12 have vowed to hone in on @entity67 's signature piece of domestic legislation , which they say will add $ 131 billion to the deficit over the next 10 years , a stark contrast to the @entity10 's projections that the 2010 law will reduce the deficit by about $ 124 billion			1
though @entity10 projections have been steeped in a strong tradition of independent , nonpartisan analysis over the office 's 40 - year history , some say @entity12 could appoint a director who would insert his bias as he or she looks at the cost and economic impact of proposed legislation			1
founding @entity10 director @entity86 , a @entity87 , said political appointees from both sides of the aisle have upheld that nonpartisan tradition since she became the office 's first director , winning respect from both sides of the aisle , and she believes that tradition will continue			1
" one would hope that you would have a @entity10 director who does not let ideology get in the way of making good estimates , " said @entity86 , who now works at the @entity98			1
" [ @entity54 ] values having a credible institution that they can rely on to give them the best estimates possible			0
" but @entity109 , a former @entity22 and @entity110 budget committee staffer , said the hyperpartisan climate in @entity112 could lead republicans to pick a budget director who would stray from the office 's impartial mission			1
" this could be the beginning of the end of the congressional budget office if it loses credibility , " said @entity109 , now the executive vice president at @entity116			1
" it 's not clear that whoever the @entity12 pick will be nonpartisan			0
the fact that it 's been relatively true in the past does n't mean it 's going to continue in the future			0
" " what 's going on now is you 've got one side , whoever 's in charge , trying to impose their will on the other , " @entity109 said			0
it 's not atypical for a new majority in @entity54 to appoint one of their own to the @entity10 once the incumbent 's term is up , but the conservative charge not to reappoint @entity13 as director comes amid a racket of support from economists on the left and the right			1
related : @entity149 is a ' social liberal ' but votes with his wallet @entity152 , former chairman of president @entity154 's @entity153 , wrote in a blog post last month that @entity13 has demonstrated both " competence and impartiality " and " shown himself to be scrupulously nonpartisan " as @entity10 head			1
" i understand that @entity12 leaders may be tempted to put their own stamp on the @entity10			0
but sometimes the benefits of continuity transcend ideology and political affiliation , " @entity152 wrote			0
and @entity14 , many of whom have had their own complaints about @entity13 , would go haywire if @entity12 look to change the character of the @entity10			1
" any effort by @entity12 to interfere with the professional integrity of the @entity10 by selecting someone to push their failed ' trickle down ' economic theory of tax cuts for the wealthy through dynamic scoring would undermine the credibility of @entity10 and the entire budget process , " said rep. @entity170 , the top @entity87 on the @entity171			2
incoming @entity171 chairman @entity21 's spokesman declined to comment on whether @entity13 would be replaced in january			2
but former @entity10 director and @entity12 appointee @entity183 said he believes the " ratio of rhetoric to reality here is extremely high			1
" " there 's always a concern that the next @entity10 director is going to politicize the place , " said @entity183 , now president of the @entity189			1
" but even if a @entity10 director would never " put their finger on the scales , " @entity183 said , the @entity10 director does have influence over what issues and studies are prioritized			1
and the party leadership is sure to drive their priorities into the office with their own person at the helm			0
and to really change procedure , congressional budget leaders would need to alter the budget office 's rules for calculating the legislation costs -- something @entity21 has tried to do through legislation			1
putting someone in charge who would eschew the rules as they are would set a serious precedent , one that could hurt @entity12 if @entity14 take back @entity223 .			0

republicans likely wo n't reappoint congressional budget director @entity13 when his term ends next month
two *ex-cbo* directors say the office will remain nonpartisan , but others worry the hyperpartisan *environment* could change the calculus
the next @entity10 director could have a big impact on *key* pieces of legislation , from budget *negotiations* to @entity65
this comes despite @entity13 's high ratings among both right - and left - leaning economists
