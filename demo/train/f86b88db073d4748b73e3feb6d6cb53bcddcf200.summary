@entity0 -- some athletes strive to conquer mountains , but @entity4 started with a much more humble goal : a lamppost			2
she had suffered a stroke in 1980 at age 10 and spent the majority of the next few years in a hospital bed or wheelchair			2
she eventually moved from her native @entity12 to @entity0 for treatment , and a family friend urged her to get in touch with @entity16 , who had started a running club for disabled athletes			1
when she met the group in @entity20 one saturday morning in 1986 , @entity16 urged her to take steps that would ultimately change her life			1
" @entity16 said to walk one lamppost to another lamppost , " she recalled			1
" i walked very slowly			2
... it was very hard			0
" that day , @entity26 walked the distance between six lampposts -- about 300 yards			0
the next week , she walked eight lampposts			0
every week , she improved , and by the next year , she finished the @entity31			0
" i felt great because i did something to help myself , " said @entity26 , 42			0
" i started my life again			0
" there are many stories like @entity26 's at @entity37 , the nonprofit @entity34 started almost 30 years ago			1
today , the organization provides free athletic training , support and a sense of community to more than 10,000 disabled athletes in 70 countries worldwide			1
the idea is relatively simple			0
at weekly runs , able - bodied volunteers are matched with disabled runners who have a variety of physical and mental challenges			2
" @entity51 , strokes , autism , diabetes , multiple sclerosis , cerebral palsy -- you probably ca n't think of a disability that 's not represented , " @entity16 said			1
running side by side , the athletes get in shape , build confidence and make friends			2
it 's an atmosphere that @entity34 , 71 , still loves			1
an above - the - knee amputee , he can still be found in @entity20 every saturday morning , making people laugh -- and groan -- with his notoriously bad jokes			0
" camaraderie is the most important part of what we do , " @entity16 said			1
" we make it into a fun thing , so that it 's not only a matter of how fast or how far can i run , but it 's about sharing the run with the group			2
" do you know a hero ? nominations are open for 2013 @entity83 many of the disabled athletes are training to achieve specific goals , whether it 's a 5 - kilometer race or the @entity31			1
@entity34 believes that when they compete in mainstream races , they change opinions on two levels			1
" when an able - bodied runner gets passed by someone on one leg , it changes their perception of what the disabled can do , " @entity16 said			1
" it also changes the way disabled athletes perceive themselves			1
" it 's a circle of inspiration that 's been growing since @entity34 started his work			1
a lifelong @entity0 , @entity34 was always athletic , even wrestling at the college level			1
but as a 24 - year - old doctoral student , he was in a car accident and eventually had one leg amputated			0
" somehow , i was n't upset , " he said			0
" when you lose a leg , there 's no ambiguity			2
... you get an artificial leg and keep going			0
" he went on to start a successful business , but the long hours spent at work took their toll			0
when a friend died of a heart attack in 1975 , he realized he needed to get in shape			0
he joined the local @entity123 and started running			0
at first , he could run only a few hundred feet			0
but he slowly built up to a mile and then five miles			0
running on his prosthetic leg , he was an unusual sight			0
" i 'd ask my coach how i was doing compared to the other amputees , and he 'd say ' about the same , ' " @entity16 remembered			1
" the joke was , there were no other amputee runners			0
" i had more than a few kids ask me if i was a bionic man , " he said			0
in 1976 , @entity34 became the first amputee to run the @entity31 , finishing in seven hours and 24 minutes			1
to @entity34 's knowledge , he is the first person to run such a distance on a prosthetic leg			1
@entity34 's achievement inspired @entity138 , a @entity139 teenager who had lost a leg to cancer			1
@entity142 decided to run across @entity139 , averaging a marathon distance of 26 miles a day , to raise money for cancer research			0
he named his crusade the @entity138 , and he ran more than 3,300 miles , raising millions of dollars and international awareness before cancer finally took his life in 1981			0
but it was after he went to @entity139 to compete in a race held in @entity142 's honor that he got the idea to start @entity37 , which he named in honor of the @entity157 warrior who was perfect except for one vulnerability			2
the group , which gets its funding from corporate and foundation grants , has no membership fee , and it will often pay race entry fees for people who ca n't afford them			0
@entity34 has never wanted anything to prevent athletes from participating			1
" running that first marathon was probably the favorite day in my life , " @entity16 said			1
" i 'm just trying to give that joy to others			0
" opinion : @entity173 , an inspiration and a question although running has always been the group 's primary focus , in recent years , @entity37 has started offering hand - crank wheelchairs , tandem biking , triathlon training and kayaking			1
after knee replacement surgery a few years ago , @entity34 stopped running himself and switched to a hand - crank wheelchair , which is low , has three wheels and is moved by the user 's arms			1
@entity37 has also developed a number of specialized programs like @entity191 , which works with more than 4,000 disabled children , and the @entity193 , which has helped more than 1,000 disabled veterans finish marathons across the country			2
army capt. @entity197 had his foot amputated in 2003 after his @entity200 hit a land mine in @entity202			0
he started training with @entity37 at @entity203 in @entity204 , and just 10 months after his injury , he ran the @entity31			2
at his request , he was deemed fit for duty , and in 2005 , he rejoined his unit in @entity202 , becoming the first amputee to return to war			0
@entity212 's story makes @entity34 glow with pride			1
" we are literally addicting people to achievement , " @entity16 said			1
" they feel good about themselves , and their level of aspiration increases dramatically			0
" since walking to that first lamppost , @entity26 has gone on to compete in 20 @entity0 marathons and five @entity222 , competing in swimming and wheelchair fencing			0
it 's a life that she says she could never have dreamed of without @entity34			1
" he ( became ) my friend , my family , my coach and my hero , " she said			2
" @entity16 helped me realize that everything is possible in my life			2
" @entity34 's influence can also be found every day in neighborhoods across the country			1
" now , you see ( disabled athletes ) running in the park all the time , " @entity16 said			1
" it 's just like a seed that we 've successfully planted			2
" want to get involved ? check out the @entity37 website at @entity244 and see how to help .			0

@entity16 's nonprofit is helping disabled athletes meet their potential , set new goals
free training has benefited more than 10,000 athletes in 70 countries
@entity34 says " camaraderie is the most important part of what we do "
