@entity0 -- the shocking murder last weekend of 16 @entity4 civilians -- 9 of them children -- by a @entity7 soldier is raising many questions about the war			1
coming right after the accidental burning of several qurans at a @entity7 base last month , which sparked mass protests across the country , it seems reasonable to ask : what is coming next ? the sad answer is that there probably wo n't be a huge public reaction to the killings			2
the burning of the @entity12 -- which the @entity7 claims was accidental -- was a fresh outrage to many @entity4			1
while the @entity24 often claims the @entity7 disrespects @entity25 and wants to destroy it , few @entity4 had any real reason to believe that in their daily lives			1
the @entity29 burning shocked the @entity4 public enough for some political opportunists to whip up protests in response			2
in contrast , sunday 's mass murder is not a new outrage for @entity4			1
while the deliberate killing of civilians is ( thankfully ) rare , many @entity4 do not distinguish between accidental and deliberate civilian death			0
last may , @entity7 helicopters in @entity41 came under rocket fire from insurgents ; in responding they accidentally fired back at what turned out to be children gathering firewood , killing 9			0
@entity47 was quick to apologize for the incident , but nevertheless the reaction in @entity50 was angry and resentful : many simply could not believe that children could be accidentally mistaken for insurgents			0
sunday 's mass killing is still shocking and upsetting -- but it is no longer surprising			1
sunday 's mass murder , in other words , is not a game - changing event			1
the game has already changed , and many @entity4 are not surprised when the @entity7 kills a bunch of civilians			1
@entity61 interviewed some of the survivors and uncovered a darker angle as well : one reason the victims did not resist is that they were used to the so - called " night raids " -- nighttime special operations raids on housing compounds			0
they were so used to @entity7 kicking in the doors to their homes and even shooting their guns that at first the rampage did n't seem strange			2
so where does the war go from here ? a huge challenge facing president @entity78 is that the @entity7 is fighting one war while the insurgency is fighting a very different one			0
the @entity7 war is obsessed with the traditional metrics of warfare : holding territory , killing or capturing bad guys , exacting details of building roads , schools , and hospitals			0
the insurgency , on the other hand , is obsessed with influence , undermining confidence in the government , and creating the perception that the @entity7 is at war with @entity25			0
put simply , the @entity7 never put in place the strategic and political framework to make much headway in @entity4			1
despite the renewed push for negotiations with the @entity24 , there is no political strategy for the country			1
there is no end state for the war , either -- right now , the plan is to drawdown to about 20,000 troops or so -- similar to troop levels in 2008 -- and stay that way for the indefinite future			0
that 's not a strategy , and it 's not a plan			0
because there is no political strategy for the war -- nothing that takes @entity4 and @entity24 politics into consideration -- the @entity7 has no concept of how to manage or react to the political consequences of incidents like sunday 's rampage			1
that 's why the military was clueless in responding to last month 's @entity29 burnings , or to january 's @entity132 urination scandal , or to the " kill team " in @entity134 last year			0
at this point , there is little the @entity7 can do to salvage the situation in @entity4			2
sunday 's mass killing is tragic but it is not a game - changing event			1
focusing on a long - term commitment to working through @entity4 politics is a good start -- de-emphasizing the military 's role in the conflict and shifting to a politically and socially engaged role would actually address some of these shortcomings			2
but shifting @entity4 from a military engagement to a political one would , by design , extend @entity7 operations there			1
an @entity156 - @entity155 poll released monday shows 60 % of @entity7 no longer think the war is worth the costs			0
from the public 's perspective , the house of cards is falling and the @entity7 would do best to just pull out and cut their losses			0
ultimately , @entity4 will suffer the consequences -- of sunday 's raid , of the war , of @entity7 's withdrawal from the region			1
abandoning @entity4 will impose huge costs in @entity4 but the last ten years of directionless fighting has left @entity7 tired and frustrated with a war that seems to go nowhere but down			2
there needs to be a long - term strategy for the country but , especially now , it probably wo n't happen			0
