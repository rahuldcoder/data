-- the cause of sunday 's power outage at the @entity3 in @entity4 has been traced to a newly installed electrical relay device meant to protect @entity7 equipment , a power company and the device 's manufacturer said friday			1
but the companies appear to be on different pages about whether human error was to blame			1
the relay , put online late last year , triggered unexpectedly , causing another device to stop supplying power to part of the building , @entity14 told city officials friday			1
the partial outage interrupted the game between the @entity23 and the @entity24 for about 35 minutes , and city officials have been anxious about whether the outage will impact the city 's efforts to attract future big - ticket events			1
@entity14 told @entity31 members that the company still does n't know why the device triggered , but the relay has been removed , the dome 's electrical system is ready to go and steps will be taken to ensure a malfunction does n't happen again			2
" rest assured , the @entity7 is fully functional , " ceo @entity39 told the council 's utility committee friday morning			2
but the relay 's manufacturer , @entity45 - based @entity43 , says it believes it knows why the problem happened : the relay , it says , was n't operated at the proper setting			0
system operators essentially put the relay 's trip setting too low , @entity43 vice president @entity50 wrote to @entity0 in an e-mail			0
the electrical load exceeded the trip setting , so the relay triggered , he said			0
that activated the switch gear , which is designed to cut some power to isolate any problem and prevent system damage and a larger outage			2
" based on the onsite testing , we have determined that if higher settings had been applied , the equipment would not have disconnected the power , " @entity64 wrote			2
" @entity43 continues to work with all those involved to get the system back online , and our customers can continue to rely on the quality and performance of our products			0
" asked whether @entity14 agrees with @entity43 's characterization of the problem , @entity14 spokesman @entity76 responded : " tests conducted by @entity43 and @entity14 on the two relays installed at the @entity7 shows that one relay functioned as expected and the other relay did not			0
" we will continue to do more testing but we believe that we have zeroed in on the device that caused the outage , and we have removed it from service			1
" @entity43 was not represented at the council committee meeting in @entity4			1
the company that manages the dome , @entity91 , told the panel it concurred that the device is linked to the power outage			1
but the explanation wo n't end the issue for some officials , as councilwoman @entity98 pressed @entity39 to allow an independent audit			0
@entity39 did n't commit , instead replying that a third - party inspector will be used if @entity14 and @entity91 determine one is needed			0
the relay and switch gear were part of @entity14 's 2011 - 2012 project to improve electrical reliability at the dome , @entity14 official @entity103 told council members			0
the relay device was n't put online until december 21			2
between then and the @entity3 , the device functioned properly during three major events -- the @entity114 , a @entity117 @entity116 game , and the @entity118 -- @entity14 said			1
@entity39 said the company would work closely with the device 's manufacturer to determine what caused the device to trigger when it should n't have			1
" we are going to do everything humanly possible ( to ensure ) we do not experience an event like this again , " @entity39 said			0
an @entity91 official emphasized to the panel that the power failure had nothing to do with @entity91 's recent efforts to replace the cables that feed electricity from @entity14 's connection points to the dome			0
the @entity137 and @entity138 , a state agency that oversees the @entity7 , had approved spending hundreds of thousands of dollars to replace the feeder cables			0
the @entity91 official said friday that the cables were replaced because they were 15 years old , and that @entity91 does n't " see any way ( the cables ) were involved in this			0
" the electrical outage at the @entity7 set off a storm of social media amusement among viewers and inspired advertising tweets with blackout twists			2
carmaker @entity151 took a swipe at its competitor , tweeting that it was sending " led lights " over to the dome , which is officially named the @entity7			2
but for the picturesque @entity3 host city -- perpetually concerned with its reputation , especially since @entity156 -- the power failure broadcast to the world was a huge embarrassment			1
mayor @entity161 promised that night there would be answers soon			0
@entity98 , pressing for a third - party examination of the cause , emphasized that the city intends to bid for the 2018 @entity3			1
" we are in contention for 2018 , " @entity98 said			0
" ( an outside test ) is clearly imperative ... to defy the naysayers that could be arising around the country to say that we should n't have this ( @entity3 )			1
" @entity176 area on the clock for history - making @entity3 @entity0 's @entity178 and @entity179 contributed to this report .			1
