and just two hours later , @entity3 capped a big day for the northern metropolis by beating @entity3 1 - 0 in the @entity13 final at @entity15 's @entity14			1
@entity17 's @entity1 team went into the penultimate match of the @entity20 campaign needing just a point to end second - placed @entity23 's title reign			1
@entity6 , battling to avoid relegation , took the lead in the 20th minute through @entity27 international @entity26 and should have gone further ahead in the 65th minute when @entity28 headed against the post			2
five minutes later @entity1 striker @entity30 went down as he tried to round @entity31 , with the goalkeeper making enough contact to send the @entity35 tumbling			2
referee @entity36 went to consult his linesman , sparking ugly scenes as the @entity1 players surrounded the officials demanding a penalty			2

" @entity3 's last appearance in the @entity13 final ended in a replay defeat by @entity107 , widely considered one of the best matches in the tournament 's 140 - year history , but a goal from semifinal hero @entity125 was enough to deny @entity3 a fairytale finish in the club 's first such outing			1
the @entity130 midfielder , who ended @entity1 's treble hopes with the only goal of the semi , lashed home a shot in the 74th minute as @entity3 scrambled to clear a slew of @entity3 attempts			1

it 's fantastic to win			0
it 's fantastic for the history of the club , " @entity125 said			2
" we wanted to win something and get through to the @entity103			0
