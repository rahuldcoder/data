-- imagine going to the internet to search your name only to find a mug shot from years ago posted on multiple websites			1
there are publications and websites whose sole purpose is to feature police booking photos			1
some make a profit selling advertising around the photos , while other websites are offering , for a price , to remove or hide these images permanently			1
@entity19 learned about the mug shot business the hard way			1
in 2003 , @entity19 woke up one morning covered in blood , with stab wounds and evicted from his home			2
@entity19 was fired from his job and slept in a gas station bathroom that night			0
@entity19 knew his life was in need of a change			0
at the time , the then - bartender was dealing with the deaths of his best friend and sister within months of each other , along with a family history of drug abuse			1
@entity19 started using cocaine at age 12 and lived in a drug - induced haze until he was 23			1
during those tumultuous years , @entity19 was arrested several times , including two instances for driving under the influence of alcohol			1
these days , @entity19 is a happily married , churchgoing father who works at the @entity44 in @entity45			0
his wife , @entity46 , is a part - time student at the @entity47 earning a master 's in social work			2
when they 're not working , life for the @entity51 revolves around their 2 - year - old daughter , @entity53			2
it is a much different existence than @entity19 once had			0
" i 'll be outside watching them and a bag of bricks hits me , " @entity19 said at his @entity57 , @entity58 , home while watching " @entity60 " with the family			0
" this is me now compared to eight years ago when i was living in a bar			1
" on paper , @entity19 is the quintessential @entity67 family man , but his past haunts him in publications and on websites that are using it for profit			1
@entity73 as part of his recovery , @entity19 went to the @entity76 to check his online image after he read that employers use @entity79 to search the names of potential employees			0
having served the time for his crimes , @entity19 was shocked to find his mug shot still posted on a website along with others			1
he contacted the site to have the image removed			0
he paid a another site to have the mug shot removed only to see his photo show up in four other places			1
" it 's like killing one flea and then saying , ' ok the flea problem is done , ' " @entity19 said			0
his frustration built when he contacted the website @entity98 , which said for $ 7,500 it could not get rid of his image , but could " bury " it in @entity76 purgatory			2
@entity19 is not alone in finding his murky past displayed for the public			2
caught up is a @entity105 - based weekly that dubs itself a " crime - fighting publication			1
" it features police booking photos			1
found primarily in smaller communities throughout @entity105 , @entity58 , @entity110 , @entity111 , and @entity112 , the publication showcases people 's names and alleged crimes listed below their mug shots			1
caught up and other similar papers collect mug shots , which are public record , from sheriffs and local police departments , who hand over the information with the names listed in alphabetical order , detailing the criminal charges			1
these photos are also featured and archived on the publication 's website caughtuplive.com			1
one issue included @entity133 's @entity132 on the cover after he was arrested on a cruise in late 2011			0
" sometimes i say i 'm the most popular woman of the small counties because police departments are so grateful , " said @entity136 , the media liaison for @entity129			1
@entity140 is involved in the publication of every paper , which puts out more than 25,000 copies weekly			1
@entity140 , who is also a paralegal , joined the @entity145 team in december 2010			1
she feels the mission of the paper is to give people the ability to keep an eye on their communities			2
she recalls one woman who wanted some extra help with her lawn over the summer			0
the woman saw a picture of a man listed as a sex offender in @entity129			0
it was the same man she was planning to hire to work at the home she shares with two teenage daughters			0
@entity140 said the woman told her it was the best $ 1 she had ever spent			0
the flip side is how the publication affects the people showcased			2
@entity140 recalled a man who was a sex offender and had finished serving his sentence			0
the man was trying to rejoin the community but felt he could n't with his mug shot in the paper and online			1
@entity140 said she and her team discussed the issue , but ultimately felt their need to inform was more important than helping the man overcome his past			0
" when you 're talking about the safety of the community and the safety of children and seeing as how these are already public records , we just made the determination that it was in the best interest of the public to have this information available , " @entity140 said			2
" the lack of knowledge was not a chance that we were ready to take			0
" mug shots : informative vs. slander ? @entity145 consists mostly of mug shots with a few related written pieces and various games that it calls " informative fun			1
" there also is some local advertising			0
caught up vice president @entity207 said in today 's economy the profit margin for this business is relatively low			0
however , the demand for the publication in smaller communities has remained the same			2
the business makes money even if the lives of the people who make up its content have changed , which leaves someone like @entity19 out of luck			0
several clients have asked @entity223 , an @entity45 - based criminal defense attorney , about removing their mug shots from the sites and about what legal action can be taken			1
" they are using a person 's image for commercial gain without their permission , " said @entity223			0
" to me , its extortion , maybe not legally , but the common use of that term			0
" @entity223 - @entity223 said legally , there is nothing that can be done			2
the only thing that could stop the publications and websites is legislation that forbids them			1
that legislation does not exist			0
@entity129 's @entity140 said she understands the concerns and said other publications might have a lower standard , but their purpose is to encourage safety in communities , not promote public humiliation			1
" people think we are in the business to mock , " @entity140 said			0
" they believe that we have photos of a person who has been arrested to allow the community to thumb their nose at and that 's not our purpose			2
if people find some of the mug shots amusing , that 's more or less a side effect			2
" @entity19 is n't laughing			0
" but that 's the main way they make profit , right , " he said			0
" we can read a paper without looking at a picture and know that seven people were arrested for @entity272 -- we do n't need the picture			2
it just -- to me -- seems like the way that they 're making money is because the pictures are pathetic or sometimes funny			0
" @entity278 is a website that erases mug shots from the web once a person has been legally cleared			1
the site said it uses " trade tools " to eliminate the mug shot			1
spokesperson @entity286 said he does not feel @entity278 should be " affiliated with the mug shot website			1
" @entity278 via @entity288 said it is the first reputation management firm to offer the service			0
for $ 399 , @entity278 allows a customer to specify one website from which to have a mug shot deleted			1
for $ 699.00 , the mug shot is removed from three sites			1
@entity297 has 14 business days to remove the mug shot from the website and @entity79 or the customer gets their money back			1
if a customer has multiple arrests with more than one booking photo , that costs more			2
in his suburban @entity45 home , @entity19 seems at peace with his new life and everything that comes with it			0
however , he 's eager to talk about his past if it means more people are aware of publications like @entity129 and sites like @entity278			2
" i 'm human , i made a couple of mistakes -- it 's not a secret i made more than one , " @entity19 said			0
" everyone has a past			0
it 's just unfortunate that mine is exploited for profit			0
