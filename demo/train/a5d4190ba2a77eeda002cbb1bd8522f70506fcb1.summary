-- @entity2 groups vented outrage friday over the decision of a @entity6 school in @entity7 to rescind the admission of an 8 - year - old student because his parents are lesbians			1
" the idea that a child might be punished because he does not live with his two biologic parents is antithetical to notions of @entity19 charity and @entity6 social justice , " said @entity11 , president of @entity12 , in a statement friday			1
other liberal @entity6 and gay groups issued similar statements friday , responding to news reports this week that a child accepted to @entity25 in @entity26 , @entity7 , for the fall was told he could n't enroll after the school learned that his parents are gay			1
in addition to pressuring the @entity7 school to reverse its decision and accept the student , progressive @entity6 activists are attempting to do something much more dramatic : get the @entity36 , which includes the @entity26 school , to set a precedent for how the @entity40 church treats students with gay parents			1
in march , the @entity43 , @entity44 , supported a decision by a catholic school in @entity47 to block two students with gay parents from re-enrolling			1
while the @entity51 archbishop who backed that decision , @entity53 , may be the most outspokenly conservative bishop in the nation , progressive @entity6 think they can get more moderate @entity56 cardinal @entity55 to speak against catholic schools rejecting students over their parents ' sexual orientation			1
" i 'm very disappointed in @entity53 's actions , but he has a history of politicizing issues , " said @entity61 , executive director of the progressive @entity62 , which has asked @entity55 to intervene in the @entity26 case and to allow the child to attend @entity65			0
" @entity55 understands that there 's a place to assert church teachings but that it does n't make sense to discriminate against a child because of his parents ' background , " @entity61 said			0
@entity61 and other left - leaning @entity6 said they were concerned that the @entity26 school was following the example of the @entity77 in the @entity47 case			2
" while the relationship between the events in @entity47 and @entity26 [ is ] not known , @entity12 is concerned that a narrative will develop that legitimizes the exclusion of children of same sex parents from catholic schools , " the group @entity12 , which is based in @entity56 , said friday			1
conservative catholic groups , meanwhile , have been mostly silent on the matter			2
" i do n't really have a strong opinion on this one , " said @entity89 , a prominent conservative @entity6 activist , in an e-mail on friday			2
" it 's a matter of the individual bishop 's discretion			0
" @entity55 has not publicly weighed in on the case , but the @entity36 said thursday that the @entity26 school was not acting in compliance with archdiocesan policy			0
" the archdiocese does not prohibit children of same - sex parents from attending catholic schools , " said @entity99 , the archdiocese 's secretary for education and superintendent of catholic schools			2
" we will work in the coming weeks to develop a policy to eliminate any misunderstandings in the future			0
" @entity99 said that the @entity36 met with one of the child 's parents on thursday and that it has offered to help enroll him in another catholic school in the archdiocese			1
the parents of the @entity65 student have insisted on anonymity for them and their son in press reports of the situation			0
the @entity123 , a @entity56 - based group whose board is chaired by @entity55 , said thursday that it would not support schools that discriminated against students based on their parents ' sexual orientation			2
` " [ @entity135 ] o school that promotes an exclusionary admissions policy or practice will be considered for support , " said the foundation 's executive director , @entity130 , in a thursday letter to school administrators			0
" we believe a policy or practice that denies admissions to students in such a manner as occurred at @entity65 's is at odds with our values as a foundation , the intentions of our donors , and ultimately with @entity151 teaching			0
" calls to @entity25 and church on friday night were not returned .			0
