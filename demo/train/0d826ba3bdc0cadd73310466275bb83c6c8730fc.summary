-- world - famous physicist @entity1 recently said the world as we know it could be obliterated instantaneously			1
basically , we would be here one minute and gone the next			0
do n't you love physics ? when we speculate about catastrophes , we do n't mess around			0
the physics underlying this speculation is related to the @entity12 particle , whose discovery was announced july 4 , 2012 , at the @entity14 , the world 's largest particle accelerator , in @entity17 , @entity18			1
a leading physicist dubbed it the " @entity21 particle " -- a name i wish would disappear , as the particle and the laws of physics tell us nothing whatsoever about @entity21 , and @entity21 , if she exists , has not opined about the @entity12 particle			1
so , the simplified argument goes like something like this -- the @entity12 particle pervades space roughly uniformly , with a relatively high mass -- about 126 times that of the proton ( a basic building block of atoms )			1
theoretical physicists noted even before the @entity12 discovery that its relatively high mass would mean lower energy states exist			1
just as gravity makes a ball roll downhill , to the lowest point , so the universe ( or any system ) tends toward its lowest energy state			2
if the present universe could one day transition to that lower energy state , then it is unstable now and the transition to a new state would destroy all the particles that exist today			1
this would happen spontaneously at one point in space and time and then expand throughout the universe at the speed of light			2
there would be no warning , because the fastest a warning signal could travel is also at the speed of light , so the disaster and the warning would arrive at the same time			0
we know spontaneous events do happen			0
the universe began in a rapid expansion called inflation that lasted only a tiny fraction of a second			1
we owe our existence to that sudden event			2
spontaneous change is something you might have seen in chemistry class			0
super-cooled water will rapidly crystallize to ice if you drop a snowflake into it , just as a salt crystal will grow when added to a supersaturated salt solution			0
whether the existence of @entity12 means we 're doomed depends on the mass of another fundamental particle , the top quark			1
it 's the combination of the @entity12 and top quark masses that determine whether our universe is stable			1
experiments like those at the @entity14 allow us to measure these masses			0
but you do n't need to hold your breath waiting for the answer			0
the good news is that such an event is very unlikely and should not occur until the universe is many times its present age			1
many bad things are possible a large asteroid destroying the @entity112			0
getting hit by a bus			2
having space time gobbled up by instability in the @entity12 field			2
( for an engaging discussion of the many ways humans can be done in by the cosmos , see the marvelous " @entity121 ! " by bad astronomer @entity120			0
) are they likely ? humans have to prioritize by considering both outcome ( death or destruction ) and probability			0
rare events like the collision of a massive asteroid with the @entity112 could destroy life as we know it and perhaps the planet itself			2
however , the chances of a sufficiently massive asteroid intersecting the @entity112 in the vast emptiness of space is pretty low			0
collisions with much less massive asteroids are much more likely but much less destructive			0
so do n't lose any sleep over possible danger from the @entity12 , even if the most famous physicist in the world likes to speculate about it			1
you 're far more likely to be hit by lightning than taken out by the @entity12 .			1

physicist @entity1 said the " @entity21 particle " could destroy the universe
@entity153 : the chance of this particle , known as @entity12 , obliterating us is tiny
she says such an event should not occur until the universe is many times its present age
@entity153 : you 're more likely to die from being hit by lightning than danger from @entity12
