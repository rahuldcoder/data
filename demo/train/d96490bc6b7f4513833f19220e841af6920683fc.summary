@entity0 -- welcome to @entity4 's @entity3 where the beaches are pristine , the downtown is spotless , but -- if you believe the accusers -- the mayor is filthy			1
the @entity9 has set up a hotline for women who believe they are victims of sexual harassment by @entity0 mayor @entity13			1
the city attorney 's office asked its lawyers , particularly females , as far back as february not to meet with the mayor unless a witness is present			1
recently , @entity13 was restricted from meeting with women alone at city facilities			1
every few days , more women come forward to tell their stories			1
@entity13 is taking two weeks off in august -- not for vacation , but for intensive therapy to treat what seems to be a behavioral disorder			1
secrets that women of @entity0 no long keep about its mayor is that what they call it these days ? in the 1970s , when @entity13 began his 20 - year career as a university history professor -- after which came a stint on the @entity38 and another 20 years in @entity39 -- we might just as easily have said that he was a lech and left it at that			1
now we think everything is curable			0
but there might not be a cure for what ails @entity13			1
it has afflicted the 70 - year - old for too long			0
over the last few weeks , seven women have stepped forward to say that @entity13 said or did something inappropriate			1
the accusations range from crude comments to unwanted advances to bullying to the infamous " @entity13 headlock			1
" let 's say it 's not just a friendly hug			0
in one of the latest developments in this soap opera by the sea , @entity13 wants the city to cover his legal expenses to fight a lawsuit filed by one of the women , @entity68 , who is a former employee			1
@entity70 was the first woman to accuse @entity13 publicly of impropriety			2
her 11 - page lawsuit alleges that @entity13 asked her to " get naked " and to kiss him			2
the @entity38 is set to discuss @entity13 's request this week			1
the council should deny the request and make @entity13 pay his own legal bills			1
he obviously has a problem , and he 's admitted as much by going to therapy			1
" let me be absolutely clear , " @entity13 said in a statement			2
" the behavior i have engaged in over many years is wrong			0
my failure to respect women , and the intimidating contact is inexcusable			0
" @entity13 must have known about his failings , while he was in @entity39 and before he ran for mayor			1
he needs to take personal responsibility and pay for his own legal defense			2
of course , what @entity13 really needs to do -- before the list of accusers gets any longer -- is resign			1
that 's what sen. @entity94 of @entity95 says			0
during an appearance sunday on @entity1 's " @entity99 , " the senator said that @entity13 " lacks a moral compass " and that he should make it easier on himself , his city , and fellow @entity103 by stepping down			1
in @entity95 @entity103 circles , once you 've lost @entity94 , it 's game over			0
for a politician , the only thing worse than being caught in a sex scandal is being caught in a sex scandal at the same time as someone else			0
that all but ensures extra coverage by the media , as the two of you will be paired together in the same paragraph in story after story			0
@entity13 has company , a fellow @entity122 with whom he served in @entity39			2
@entity123 are suffering through the " sext - capades " of @entity125			0
the supposedly rehabilitated amateur photographer wants to be mayor of @entity123 , but he has fallen to fourth place among @entity103 contenders in the polls since admitting he engaged in the same behavior that caused him to resign from @entity39 in disgrace			2
as i watch the @entity125 drama from afar , i ca n't help but think that one of the factors hurting his candidacy is that his public relations machine had gone to such great lengths to portray him as " all better " when it turns out he 's not			0
@entity123 do n't like being played for suckers , and now @entity125 is experiencing their wrath			0
@entity13 should watch and learn			2
he 'll be back from his two - week leave of absence soon enough			0
then what ? " when i return on august 19 , " he told reporters , " my focus will be on making sure that i am doing right by the city in terms of being the best mayor that i can be and the best person i must be			2
" is it really that easy for someone to get rid of a disorder that has plagued him for decades ? i do n't think so			0
when he returns to office , @entity13 might just get into more trouble with women			1
and if and when that happens , he 'll experience the same public backlash that @entity125 has			0
he might not need to resign			0
a recall effort is already under way			0
and hell hath no fury like a voter who thinks he 's being played for a fool			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity167 .			2

seven women have come forward to say @entity0 mayor was sexually inappropriate
@entity167 : mayor @entity13 is going to therapy , but it 's unlikely to cure *longtime* problem
@entity13 is being sued and wants city to pay his legal bills , he says , but that 's *ridiculous*
@entity167 : what @entity13 really needs to do is resign , because problem is not going away
