-- @entity1 is threatening @entity2 with legal action following a row over drugs testing which leaves their proposed super-bout next year in doubt			1
@entity1 is refusing to agree to a demand by the @entity2 camp to undergo @entity11 style blood - screening in the run up to the fight , which is penciled in for the @entity14 in @entity15 on march 13			1
boxing commentators had suggested that the war of words was a pre-fight tactic by the @entity2 camp and his promoter , @entity22 , to unsettle the @entity23 , who has hit back with an angry statement on his personal web site			1
these people , @entity29 , @entity30 , and @entity22 , think it is a joke and a right to accuse someone wrongly of using steroids or other performance - enhancing drugs , " it read			0
" i have tried to just brush it off as a mere pre-fight ploy but i think they have gone overboard " @entity1 , who became a five - weight world champion by beating @entity42 @entity41 in november , claimed he would now be calling in the lawyers			2
" i have instructed my promoter , @entity44 , head of @entity45 , to help me out in the filing of the case as soon as possible because i have had people coming over to me now asking if i really take performance - enhancing drugs and i have cheated my way into becoming the number one boxer in the world			1
" i maintain and assure everyone that i have not used any form or kind of steroids and that my way to the top is a result of hard work , hard work , hard work and a lot of blood spilled from my past battles in the ring , not outside of it			0
" i have no idea what steroids look like and my fear in @entity71 has kept me safe and victorious through all these years			0
" the row started earlier this week when @entity2 's promoters @entity22 went public with their demands for blood - testing , as mandated by the @entity76 ( @entity76 ) and making it a condition before the super-fight went ahead			1
but @entity1 's trainer @entity80 said this was not necessary under the rules governing fights in @entity84 and was mind games by the @entity2 camp			1
" we have passed every test ever given to us			0
we go by the commission rules , since when does the fighter make up the rules ? , " he said			0
@entity2 himself has largely kept his counsel but told the @entity22 web site that he hoped his possible opponent would change his mind			2
" i understand @entity1 not liking having his blood taken , because frankly i do n't know anyone who really does , " @entity2 said			2
" i hope this is either some miscommunication or that @entity1 will change his mind and step up and allow these tests , which were good enough for all these other great athletes , to be performed by @entity76			0
" but @entity1 in his message posted on @entity104 showed little sign of extending the festive spirit to the unbeaten @entity2			2
" to @entity2 , despite all these accusations , may your @entity104 be merry and i will see you in court , soon , " he added .			0
