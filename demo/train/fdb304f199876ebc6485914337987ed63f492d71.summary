-- livestock producers suffering through one of the most severe droughts in decades will most likely have to wait until @entity4 returns from its august recess before getting any new federal disaster assistance			1
a @entity9 @entity8 leadership aide tells @entity0 that the @entity9 is " unlikely " to take up an aid bill that the @entity11 plans to pass thursday before lawmakers dash out of town for a five - week break			1
the aide said the @entity9 ca n't accept the @entity11 bill because there are too many differences between it and an - already approved @entity9 measure , both in terms of who is covered and how the cost of the aid is offset			1
the drought assistance was part of a broader five - year farm policy bill that got bogged down in the regional and partisan politics of the @entity11 , despite major efforts in recent weeks to pass it			0
but with mounting pressure from drought - stricken livestock producers , the @entity11 decided at the last minute to extend disaster aid just for them before leaving town			1
the @entity11 bill would help cover the cost of livestock loses and the high cost of feed because of the drought			0
with bipartisan support earlier this summer , the @entity9 passed its own five - year farm bill that includes disaster assistance for livestock farmers and ranchers			1
the @entity9 has pushed the @entity11 to pass its own bill so the two versions could be quickly reconciled and the disaster assistance could once again be available			2
livestock producers are in a different predicament than other farmers because in the last five - year farm bill , the livestock portion was extended for only four years and has now expired			2
senate majority leader @entity53 , @entity54 , warned tuesday that if the @entity11 wanted quick @entity9 action on that aid , it should pass the @entity9 's version of it			0
" i think that what the @entity11 should do is take the provisions we have in our bill that we sent to them , and if they want to do something about drought relief , send that to us , " @entity53 said			0
but @entity11 @entity66 decided wednesday they would pass their own language and then leave it to the @entity9			0
republicans said @entity69 would suffer political consequences if they chose not to pass it .			0
