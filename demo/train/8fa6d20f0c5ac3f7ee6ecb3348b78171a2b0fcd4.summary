a representation of the skull generated from the ct scans taken at @entity11			0
the remains of the brain were found in a skull unearthed during excavations at @entity18 in northern @entity0 , a statement from the university said friday			1
the dig site was described by investigators from @entity21 as being in an extensive prehistoric farming landscape of fields , track ways and buildings dating back to at least 300 bc. they believe the skull , which was found on its own in a muddy pit , may have been a ritual offering			2
@entity28 , who was taking part in the dig , described how she felt something move inside the cranium as she cleaned the soil - covered skull 's outer surface			2
peering through the base of the skull , she spotted an unusual yellow substance			1
" it jogged my memory of a university lecture on the rare survival of ancient brain tissue			2
we gave the skull special conservation treatment as a result , and sought expert medical opinion , " she said in a statement on @entity18 's web site			1
a sophisticated @entity51 at @entity11 was then used to produce startlingly clear images of the skull 's contents			1
@entity55 , consultant neurologist at the @entity11 said : " i 'm amazed and excited that scanning has shown structures which appear to be unequivocally of brain origin			0
i think that it will be very important to establish how these structures have survived , whether there are traces of biological material within them and , if not , what is their composition			0
" dr @entity67 , @entity68 in @entity69 at the @entity70 added : " the survival of brain remains where no other soft tissues are preserved is extremely rare			1
this brain is particularly exciting because it is very well preserved , even though it is the oldest recorded find of this type in the @entity6 , and one of the earliest worldwide			0
" according to @entity18 , the find is the second major discovery during archaeological investigations on the site of the @entity18 's $ 745 million campus expansion			1
