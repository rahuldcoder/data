a man suspected in last year 's killing of @entity4 student @entity3 has been charged with first - degree murder in the case , a prosecutor told reporters tuesday			1
the murder charge against @entity13 comes in addition to a count of abduction with intent to defile filed against him previously , @entity11 @entity10 's attorney @entity9 said			1
" these indictments signal the beginning of the next phase in what has been an incredibly difficult process for the family of @entity3 , for our community and for the men and women of the many departments and agencies who have worked on this matter since september of last year , " @entity9 said			1
@entity9 's team decided not to charge @entity13 with capital murder , which could have led to a death sentence if he were convicted			1
@entity9 said she would n't give details on what led to that decision , except to say that a " great deal of serious thought " went into it			0
those considerations included " the impact on the community , the @entity45 , and the need to provide mr. @entity13 with a fair trial			2
" " i have discussed this matter with the @entity45 on many occasions , and they are aware of the indictments , " @entity9 said			0
@entity13 also was charged with reckless driving in two incidents about a week after @entity54 's disappearance , @entity9 said			1

his attorney , @entity57 , declined to comment tuesday , except to acknowledge the february 18 court appearance and to say that he received news of the indictments late monday afternoon			0
@entity54 , 18 , went missing before dawn on september 13 after she was last spotted on surveillance video in @entity66 's @entity65 area			2
in october , authorities found what turned out to be @entity54 's skull and bones on abandoned property 8 miles from where the college sophomore was last seen			0
surveillance video and other accounts led authorities to identify @entity13 as a suspect in her disappearance			2
@entity13 , 33 , was taken into custody on september 24 on a beach in @entity80 , @entity81 , about 1,300 miles away from where @entity54 was last seen			1
@entity13 's arrest in the @entity54 case prompted authorities to investigate his possible links to a string of unsolved killings and disappearances in the area			2
one of those cases involved 17 - year - old @entity91 of @entity92 , @entity93 , who disappeared in 2013 and whose body has not been found			0
but on friday , authorities said they had found no link between him and @entity91 's slaying			0

authorities said that in september 2005 , a 26 - year - old woman returning from a grocery store was grabbed from behind and sexually assaulted			0
the attacker was scared off by a passerby			0
information from the 2005 victim led police to link @entity13 to the case of another missing young woman , @entity113 , a @entity114 student who vanished in @entity66 in october 2009 and was found dead a few months later			1
@entity13 has not been charged in that case			1
investigators are looking into his possible connection to other similar cases in the area			0
