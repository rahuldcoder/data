catapulted into the international spotlight after the publication of a sensational biography in 2012 , @entity0 became the most famous @entity6 defector			1
a soft - spoken and shy man , @entity0 shared his harrowing story about escaping from a total control zone called @entity10 , giving @entity12 audiences an accessible reading on @entity6			1
over the weekend , @entity0 stated that parts of his stories are inaccurate , although he did not specify which aspects			1
he posted on @entity17 that parts of his past " that i so badly wanted to cover up can no longer be hidden			0
" @entity21 , author of " @entity22 , " wrote on his website that @entity0 had admitted several inaccuracies , including the length of time he spent in @entity10			2
for more : @entity6 prison camp survivor admits inaccuracies @entity0 's high - profile role and now admitted inconsistencies in his story raised concerns that it could undermine human rights advocacy efforts and distract from testimonies by other @entity6 refugees			1
" there are a lot of people who actually have been to the ( prison ) camp and experienced it			0
it will be wrong for their witness accounts to lose credibility because of this incident , " said @entity42 , a former @entity6 camp guard who knows @entity0			1
@entity48 , director of the human rights group @entity49 , said he 's " worried that people testifying about @entity6 will be called a liar " but that @entity0 's new revelations ca n't challenge the fact that " @entity6 control camps exist			1
" @entity48 said that many @entity6 refugees , such as @entity0 , suffer from major trauma after escaping the regime and called for support			2
" i hope he gathers his courage and tells his story accurately and honestly , and we must help him do that			0
" scrutiny on @entity6 's human rights abuses @entity6 memoirs and testimonies can not be verified -- there are no paper trails and investigators can not interview or access witnesses in a closed society			2
their stories are compared for consistency with other defectors and experts , but the process is far from foolproof			0
@entity1 has not been able to reach @entity0 , who noted in his social media apology that " these will be my final words and this will likely be my final post			0
" @entity0 's admission of inaccuracies comes at a time of unparalleled attention on @entity6 's human rights record following a landmark @entity88 report listing abuses of the @entity90 regime			1
while " @entity22 " was not the sole reason for the creation of the commission , @entity94 , then the @entity88 high commissioner for human rights , urged the probe after meeting @entity0 and another @entity6 prison camp survivor in december 2012			1
since the commission report 's release in 2014 , the @entity98 has called for more sanctions and a referral of those responsible to the @entity103			0
the matter remains at the @entity105 , where it 's likely @entity107 would block referrals of @entity109 and his leadership to the @entity103			0
double horror or triple horror ? @entity113 , chairman of the @entity114 into @entity6 , said that @entity0 's testimony consisted of only two paragraphs in the 400 - page report and that he was only one of hundreds of @entity6 witnesses			1
" it 's a very small part of a very long story			0
and it really does n't affect the credibility of the testimony , which is online , " he said			0
" lots of people took part ( in ) this inquiry			0
their stories are powerful and convincing , and these stories do not only represent @entity0 but other people in @entity6			1
" in a reversal of his story told for years , @entity0 told @entity21 on friday that he had been transferred to another prison , @entity136 18 , when he was 6 , instead of spending his entire life inside @entity6 at the total control zone @entity10 , the author says on his website			1
the distinction of whether @entity0 was imprisoned in @entity10 or 18 was not a deal breaker for @entity113			0
" it seems as if the issue is whether he was in the total control zone , or whether he was in an ordinary prison camp			2
in another words , it 's whether triple horror or double horror , " @entity113 said			0
pressures @entity0 bears the physical scars of torture , including a missing fingertip and burn marks on his back , according to the book			0
and @entity21 noted in his book that during the interview process , @entity0 at times was unreliable and " in many crucial instances , corrected his @entity6 memoir " -- an autobiography that @entity0 wrote in 2007 , called " escape to the @entity165 , " which was only published in @entity6			1
@entity6 had sought to discredit @entity0			2
last fall , a pro-north @entity6 government website released videos with @entity169 subtitles featuring a man whom @entity0 recognized to be his father , disputing the story that his son was ever in a prison camp			1
@entity0 responded with a statement , accusing the government of " holding my father hostage			0
" it 's unclear if the video had any bearing on the timing of @entity0 's admission			1
@entity42 , the former prison camp guard who has known @entity0 for seven years , said he believes the crux of @entity0 's story is true and that torture in either camp is still the same			1
" @entity0 became an icon for @entity6 human rights			2
whether he was in @entity189 18 , he is definitely a person from a political prison camp			2
he was born there and tortured there			0
" @entity1 's @entity193 and @entity194 contributed to this report .			0

@entity0 , subject of best - selling book , admits part of his stories are inaccurate
advocates say it does n't matter which @entity6 prison camp @entity0 was in
some fear @entity0 's admission of inaccuracies will affect views of other defectors ' testimonies
