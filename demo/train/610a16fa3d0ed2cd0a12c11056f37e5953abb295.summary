-- a leading humanitarian group says @entity3 militias in @entity4 are pulling displaced people into their movements because governments and international entities are failing to adequately address their plight			1
two @entity11 militiamen take up combat positions during recent clashes with @entity4 security forces			1
@entity15 underscored that development in a report issued tuesday titled " uprooted and unstable : meeting @entity18 in @entity4			2
" the report says the @entity22 , the government of @entity4 and the international community are n't doing enough to address the daily problems faced by the 2.7 million internally displaced @entity4 , who have fled homes in war - torn regions to other places in @entity4			1
those people find themselves unemployed in their new locations and many times unable to access food and health care			0
" as a result of the vacuum created by the failure of both the @entity4 government and the international community to act in a timely and adequate manner , non-state actors play a major role in providing assistance to vulnerable @entity4 , " the report says			2
social services are being provided by " militias of all denominations " that want to build their groups , with @entity47 's political movement using a @entity49 model to set itself up " as the main service provider in the country			1
" @entity49 , the @entity11 militant group labeled a terrorist group by the @entity22 , has built a large base of support with its social service network			1
" similarly , other @entity11 and @entity3 groups are gaining ground and support through the delivery of food , oil , electricity , clothes and money to the civilians living in their fiefdoms			2
" not only do these militias now have a quasi-monopoly in the large - scale provision of assistance in @entity4 , they are also recruiting an increasing number of civilians to their militias -- including displaced @entity4 , " the report said			1
the report says @entity47 's militia , the @entity78 , has resettled displaced @entity4 " free of charge in homes that belonged to @entity81			1
" " it provides stipends , food , heating oil , cooking oil and other non-food items to supplement the @entity89 rations which are still virtually impossible to transfer after displaced @entity4 have moved to a new neighborhood , though it is easier for @entity91 to do so , " the report says			1
@entity15 visited a @entity93 office in @entity96 's @entity95 district and observed residents providing " clothing , milk , oil , rice , sugar , clothes and fuel for heating and cooking when supplies are available			0
" the @entity93 also adjudicate legal disputes among citizens and give stipends to families of displaced people and slain or jailed @entity78 fighters			0
the report says @entity3 militias also play a similar role in helping needy and displaced @entity81 , though there is less organized help			1
" sunni militias also handle the distribution of key items such as heating gas			0
as @entity81 in @entity96 get virtually no electricity or other services from the government , they rely on local militias and warlords to secure their areas and manage what services they can obtain			0
" the displaced have joined " awakening " groups -- the " @entity22 - backed militias " dominated by @entity81			2
those groups provide security duties , such as guarding checkpoints , and many of them have been getting paychecks from the @entity22			0
the @entity141 refugee agency says the displacement crisis caused by the war in @entity4 is the most significant in the @entity144 since the population changes that occurred during the 1948 creation of @entity147			0
along with the 2.7 million internally displaced people , there are more than 2 million @entity4 refugees -- mostly in @entity151 and @entity152			0
the report slams the government of @entity4 as being " unwilling " and " unable " to address such humanitarian issues -- " lacking both the capacity and the political will to use its important resources to address humanitarian needs			2
" " the little assistance provided by the government is perceived by most as being biased in favor of the @entity11 population , especially when it comes to the delivery of government services such as electricity or food ration cards from the @entity89 , " the report says			0
the report adds that the " international community has largely been in denial " about the dire humanitarian situation in @entity4			1
" only recently has the @entity141 issued a common humanitarian appeal for @entity4 , recognizing the nature of the situation and the need for all agencies to step up and address humanitarian needs			0
