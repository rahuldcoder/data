-- it might be a bit of a blur to everyone else , but @entity5 always seems to keep a clear head -- even in the most pressurized situations			1
and if the football maestro 's opponents struggle to keep up with him , spare a thought for the sports photographers who have to track his moments of magic			2
@entity15 's artful image of the @entity17 star in action against @entity19 at the last @entity20 in @entity21 captures his dynamism down to a tee			1
but it was n't the shot he had expected to walk away with at @entity28 's @entity27 that evening			2
" i had planned to go up into the crowd , " @entity15 told @entity0 's @entity30 series			1
" i found a position in the stands which i thought might give me a different angle , but a steward took exception to me being there			2
" the @entity38 - accredited @entity15 protested , stayed put and the game started			1
" about 10 of them showed up in full riot gear and said , ' you ca n't stay here			2
' i was n't going to argue , so i was escorted down to the pitch where they thought all the photographers should be			2
" i kind of squeezed in late -- not in a great position -- and i thought i might as well just go for it			0
@entity5 is playing and if i can get one image of him like this , i 'll be happy			1
" the image was captured using a technique called panning , where the photographer follows a moving subject during an exposure			1
a successful shot will blur the background , giving a sense of movement and speed while keeping the subject , or part of it , in focus			2
" i had a couple of attempts earlier that did n't really work -- a lot of the frames are a complete blur			0
but then luckily he had a good run down the wing , " says @entity15 , who is senior @entity20 photographer at leading agency @entity70			1
" the key thing you 're trying to do is freeze the head , and we 're quite lucky that the ball looks fairly frozen as well			0
" the image was captured using a 400 mm telephoto lens mounted on a monopod , with @entity15 opting for a super-slow shutter speed -- around one - eighth of a second compared with 1,000th of a second typically used for action shots			1
@entity5 's forward - leaning , athletic pose is amplified by the disorganized tangle of arms and legs of his straggling opponent			1
" it actually works better in other sports , particularly ones when they 're on a predictable path like athletics or speed skating , " @entity15 says of the panning technique			1
" you know they 're going to be at a particular place and you can try again and again			0
the nature of football is very zigzag ... so you do n't get many of these			0
" @entity15 also turned his lens on @entity5 's national coach during the 2010 tournament , capturing @entity108 celebrating the winning goal in his first match in charge at a @entity20 finals			1
even more impressively , he took the defining image of the final between the @entity115 and @entity116 , dropping the shutter at the exact moment @entity120 's boot clattered into @entity122 's chest			0
when he 's not snapping a match action , the 52 - year - old is always on the lookout for salable pictures elsewhere			1
" you 've always got to have your camera with you just in case			0
you never know what 's going to be happening anywhere , " he says			0
a good example was a beautiful shot of kids playing football taken in the week before the 2010 tournament kicked off			1
" we were driving back from @entity28 when my colleague saw these children playing football in this sort of dirt ditch on the edge of a very large township , " @entity15 explains			1
" the office and the world media were crying out for an image that showed football in @entity21 and i 'd like to think that this one summed it up quite nicely			0
" another enduring photo has been one @entity15 took two decades ago at the tournament hosted by the @entity153 the image of @entity157 players ' hands clutching the trophy following their penalty shootout victory over @entity160 in the 1994 final will be instantly recognizable to football fans worldwide			1
" we had exhausted all the team photos of them and i just happened to notice a couple of them trying to get their hands on the trophy , " @entity15 says			2
" i think a large part of its success is that you 've got different ethnic groups holding it -- you 've got white guys and black guys			0
i think this is @entity179 and @entity180 holding the trophy			0
" " it 's probably my biggest - selling image			2
it 's been used everywhere			0
you see it on games , books and god knows what ! " he says			0
as @entity192 2014 heads toward its climax in @entity195 's famous @entity194 on sunday , @entity15 will be pitch - side once again , ready for another shot at getting his name onto the front pages			1
it 's what he lives for			0
" this is why we do the job			0
not many people find out who took the image but i know and i see it			0
and the more i see it , the better i like it			0
" fancy yourself as a photographer ? send us your best football pics			2
