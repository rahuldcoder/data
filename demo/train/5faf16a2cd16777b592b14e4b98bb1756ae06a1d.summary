-- hey @entity1 ! we 're back ! hope you do n't mind if we cruise around in our scientific suv to grab some historic data and snap some breathtaking images			1
oh , and we might do some @entity1 doughnuts in your front yard			1
now that the @entity1 rover curiosity is safely parked , @entity10 's unmanned planet crawler appears ready to roll			1
a car salesman would have a ball selling this beauty			0
it 's loaded with an array of sophisticated cameras , a " rocker bogie " suspension , a robotic arm , 2 gigs of flash memory , a rock - vaporizing laser ( ! ! ! ! ) and a plutonium - fueled power system			0
it operates by remote control from millions of miles away and has a blazing top speed of 1.5 inches per second			0
sticker price ( including delivery ) : $ 2.6 billion			0
during its expected lifespan of 23 months , all this cool hardware could help solve big mysteries : has life ever existed on @entity1 ? what can @entity1 tell us about our own planet ? can we benefit from @entity1 resources ? but there are less romantic questions swirling around the fourth rock from the sun : is the price tag really worth it ? who will pay for the first manned mission to @entity1 ? could manned space missions be replaced by robotic exploration ? the answers may be hard to see amid all the rover revelry			1
and this is n't the first time rovers have churned up this kind of excitement			0
in 1997 , a smaller @entity10 robot on @entity1 -- @entity55 -- lit up the @entity56			1
" back when the @entity58 was young , it was the largest internet event in the history of that medium , " curiosity team member @entity57 told @entity0 on monday			2
the little rover found clues suggesting that @entity1 once had a thicker atmosphere and liquid water			1
@entity55 and its parent spacecraft pathfinder cost $ 265 million ( @entity68 )			0
" later , in 2004 , when the @entity72 rovers landed , it became one of the largest worldwide internet sensations , " said @entity57 , who also worked on that mission			0
" it slammed @entity10 's website			1
" the rovers scored several discoveries including evidence of an ancient wet environment on @entity1			1
price tag for @entity72 : $ 800 million ( @entity68 )			0
nowadays -- at least for some space travel fans -- @entity1 robots are n't so cool anymore			1
curiosity " is just another box with wheels on @entity1 , " says @entity0 commenter @entity84			1
" develop useful technology -- not this shooting of boxes with wheels all over the place			2
@entity92 , and i will be proud			0
" @entity0 commenter @entity94 disagrees			2
" this really was a huge leap from previous missions			0
" related story : @entity87 's wild ride after the initial excitement of monday 's landing , even the curiosity team jokingly acknowledged the first dusty black and white photos from the rover have already lost their luster			2
" it 's not such a great picture anymore , " a smiling @entity107 told reporters			0
he promised color and panorama photos in the coming days			0
seriously , no matter how successful unmanned missions might be , robots will never replace the need for human space exploration , says @entity57			2
in a sense , @entity87 is performing a scouting mission for a manned @entity120 mission to @entity1 that president @entity121 predicts will happen in his lifetime			1
@entity10 administrator @entity123 gets even more specific : manned missions to @entity1 are at least 18 years away -- sometime in the 2030s			1
but first , mission planners need more information about the @entity1 surface so they can choose the best landing sites			1
" we do n't want astronauts to be surprised , " says @entity57			0
robot missions , such as @entity133 , preceded the @entity134 , and these @entity1 probes are performing similar tasks			1
putting a monetary value on space exploration is impossible , experts say , because there are too many unanswered questions , such as whether @entity1 , the moon or asteroids hold precious minerals , water and cheap energy resources that could be mined and brought back to @entity147			2
" the reason to send humans will be because we have to , " @entity57 says			0
" if some things can be done by robots , they should be done by robots			0
but sending a drill rig to @entity1 or @entity157 's @entity156 to tap into an aquifer that may have living organisms in it -- those kinds of things will require people			2
" then there 's the unknown value of newly discovered knowledge			0
scientists want to know what @entity1 can tell us about our own planet 's climate and geology			2
that knowledge , experts say , could help solve difficult environmental problems on @entity147			0
" it 's human nature to explore , " says @entity57			0
" by going to difficult or dangerous places , we carry the rest of our species along with us			0
these stories become part of part of our culture , part of our heritage , part of our shared need to explore the worlds around us			0
it 's a human endeavor that is part science , part inspiration			0
" related story : @entity147 loves @entity1 -- why we 're crushing on the red planet by the way , @entity87 has fostered jobs , says @entity10 ; more than 7,000 people have worked on the project across 31 states			1
what 's next ? @entity10 plans test flights for @entity200 -- a spacecraft designed to carry astronauts outside low @entity203 -- as soon as 2014			2
in 2017 , @entity10 plans to launch @entity200 with a new heavy - lift rocket @entity10 calls the space launch system			2
but big questions remain : how would @entity10 pay for development of a landing vehicle ? or a vehicle for astronauts to travel on the @entity1 or lunar surface ? or how would it develop an astronaut habitat suitable for the months it would take to travel to @entity1 or to asteroids ? @entity10 's proposed budget for 2013 is $ 17.7 billion -- $ 59 million less than 2012 ( @entity68 )			1
it includes a " lower cost program " for unmanned missions to @entity1 ( @entity68 )			1
for perspective , the @entity1 rover 's $ 2.6 billion price tag equals about 14.7 % of @entity10 's proposed 2013 budget			1
however , the budget also calls for more money for manned deep space programs , including almost $ 3 billion for @entity200 and the @entity205			0
in may , something happened right above our heads that gave us a glimpse into the future of @entity1 exploration			2
that 's when the private firm @entity233 successfully docked its @entity235 spacecraft with the orbiting international space station			0
@entity10 is studying a proposal -- referred to as @entity235 -- that would use a @entity233 rocket for less - expensive unmanned missions to @entity1			1
but robot missions are just stepping stones to what many experts say is a foregone conclusion			2
" humans are going to live on @entity1 in the president 's expected lifetime , " says commercial space consultant @entity245 , a former @entity10 executive			1
" it will happen as a partnership between @entity120 entrepreneurs and private industry and @entity10			1
" complete coverage of @entity1 so what do you think ? are billion - dollar , planet - crawling robots worth the money ? do you think astronauts will set foot on @entity1 within your lifetime ? share your opinion in the comments section below .			1

@entity1 robot curiosity " just another box with wheels , " says commenter
expert : manned @entity1 missions and @entity1 robots both *important*
@entity10 will partner with private industry for manned missions , says consultant
@entity121 , @entity10 predict manned @entity1 landing as soon as 18 years
