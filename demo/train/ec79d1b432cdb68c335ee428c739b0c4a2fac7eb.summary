generations of @entity1 have grown up pledging to " remember remember the fifth of november : @entity6 , treason and plot " -- the figure of @entity10 linked forever with fireworks , bonfires and childhood fun			2
now -- more than four hundred years after the gruesome death of the man who plotted to blow up the @entity13 with barrels of gunpowder -- members of the @entity18 and @entity19 movements are hoping to provide their own reason to remember @entity22			1
on saturday , november 5 , hundreds of protesters wearing the sinister black and white @entity10 masks plan to march on @entity25 in central @entity26			1
" it will be a night our government never forgets , " @entity27 , a member of hacker group @entity19 , said with a smile			2
" our government should be expecting us			0
" the march will recreate one of the final scenes of " @entity41 , " a film based on the comic books by @entity37 about a mysterious masked revolutionary who brings down a totalitarian regime , succeeding where @entity10 failed by blowing up parliament			1
the @entity10 mask , worn by @entity41 , the film 's protagonist -- with its diabolical grin , devilish black moustache and thin goatee on a porcelain white background -- has become the talisman of a new generation of activists as an unprecedented wave of disgust and anger with establishment figures has swept the world			1
while the mask has been spotted in occupy protests from @entity60 to @entity61 in the past month as people rally against what they perceive as growing corporate greed and rising social inequality , the mask was first embraced by international hacker ring @entity19 in 2008			1
the group of hackers , notorious for their online attacks on high profile banks and government agencies , first wore the masks to conceal their identities in public protests against the @entity75 in 2008			0
@entity77 founder @entity76 recently wore one to a rally at @entity79 in @entity26 , where occupy protesters and members of @entity19 have been camping in tents since the demonstration began three weeks ago			1
@entity27 , a 44 - year - old @entity19 member and camper , says the mask has become " an international symbol for rebellion and anonymity			1
" " the point of wearing the mask is to be able to go to a protest without fear of retribution or aggression from the establishment , " he said , his mask perched on the crown of his head			0
" i have no problem with anyone having my identity , but i like the fact i can choose not to			0
" @entity103 , 19 , is a fan of the @entity41 books but says it does n't matter why people choose to wear it			0
" some people wear it to make a fashion statement , others because they know what it 's about , " he said			0
" i thought i would show my support for the book and for @entity19 by picking up a mask and being part of the movement			2
" the popularity of the mask -- an estimated 100,000 were sold last year -- has created a bit of a conundrum for activists who are trying to undermine , not support , businesses owned by the establishment			0
@entity126 ( which also owns @entity127 ) owns the rights to the masks , meaning every mask sold puts more money , albeit a small amount , into the corporation 's coffers			0
rather than continue to give money to a company they say they do n't support , activists are now having their own replica masks mass - produced and shipped in from @entity139 , according to several @entity19 members			2
rather than buy an officially licensed mask at a shop in central @entity26 , @entity103 said he was able to purchase his mask from an @entity19 member for Â£ 3 ( $ 4.80 )			1
" we do n't really want people putting money into corporate pockets , and this is one of our solutions , " explained @entity19 's @entity27			0
in the four centuries since @entity10 was sentenced to death -- by the brutal punishment of being hung , then drawn and quartered -- for his treason , there has been much debate in @entity1 over whether he was a terrorist or a freedom fighter			1
ironically @entity10 , far from being the anti-establishment hero he has come to be seen as in the years since his death , was a monarchist who merely wanted to replace the @entity159 king with a @entity161 queen			2
he lived in an age when @entity163 was split along religious lines , and in @entity165 , any sign of allegiance to the pope and @entity169 could result in imprisonment or even death ( indeed , under the later 1701 @entity172 , no @entity161 or anyone married to a @entity161 could be crowned king or queen , a law whose repeal was announced last week )			0
but it is perhaps @entity10 ' " man of action " persona that most intrigues anti-establishment activists today , and @entity27 is quick to repeat the age - old adage about @entity10			0
" as they say -- @entity10 was the only man ever to enter @entity25 with honest intentions , " he said with a grin .			1
