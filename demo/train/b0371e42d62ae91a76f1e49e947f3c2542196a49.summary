@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity4 ' comments friday may become the most scrutinized apology in history , fodder for dinner tables and internet chat rooms alike : was he genuine ? was it a pr stunt ? can he do anything to restore people 's faith in him ? the biggest knock on golf 's biggest star is that it took him three months to utter any words publicly about his infidelity and then did so in a controlled environment			1
that 's a no - no , according to apology etiquette			1
" if you have to take time to say ' sorry , ' you 're not being authentic			1
