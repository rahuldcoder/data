@entity0 , @entity1 -- @entity3 is the prohibitive favorite for the @entity6 ' presidential nomination in 2016			1
and there are countless political operatives with opinions on how she should run her all - but - certain campaign			0
that combination has led to tons of unsolicited advice thrown at the former secretary of state , some of it counter intuitive and a lot of contradictory			1
here are the five pieces of unsolicited advice being volleyed regularly at @entity3 : 1			1
) run from @entity22 president @entity22 took most of the blame for @entity6 ' losses on nov. 4			1
so shortly after @entity27 , a cacophony of anonymous allies were telling @entity3 to run away from the president she served under for four years			2
" she is not president @entity22			0
let 's not forget , they were a team of rivals , " one ally told @entity33			0
" now is the time to further enunciate these differences			0
" @entity3 allies expressed similar sentiments to @entity2			2
the thinking goes that if the president is unpopular , @entity3 should start distance herself now , as opposed to months down the road when it may be harder			2
) run to @entity22 @entity3 allies have also been telling reporters that because @entity49 pickups in @entity50 create a larger target for both her and the president , it would make sense for them to join forces			2
" president @entity22 's legacy is now entirely dependent on the election of a @entity6 successor as president who will protect and extend it , not demolish it , " @entity56 , the chairman of a @entity57 , told the @entity58			1
" should she run , they both now have a common enemy in a @entity69 that will define politics through 2016			0
" @entity71 , the president of the @entity72 , echoed @entity56 in the same @entity58 story			0
" looking ahead to 2016 , i think it would be wise for the entire party , but particularly its presidential aspirants , to learn the lesson of [ @entity82 ] @entity81 and the 2014 midterms , " @entity71 said , referencing two elections where @entity6 ran away from their own president			1
" you can not run away from the president of your party			0
) find a rationale @entity89 , president @entity22 senior political adviser who at one point was hell bent on beating @entity3 , told an audience in @entity93 on thursday that in order to win in 2016 , @entity3 needs to " not rely too much on that we do have an electoral vote advantage and demographic advantages			1
" instead , @entity89 argued that @entity3 need to find a rationale for her campaign , and do it quickly			2
" i think the danger for @entity3 is that , as was the case in 2007 , her candidacy is out in front of the rationale for it , " @entity89 said , urging the former secretary of state to get out of the " cocoon of inevitability			1
) deal with your baggage @entity114 visited @entity115 on wednesday , and the former presidential candidate revealed he had his own advice for @entity3			1
" she 's a candidate who , with her baggage , can be beaten by the right candidate who handles it the right way and by the right campaign who handles it the right way , " the former @entity119 mayor said			0
" as a first lady she tried one thing and failed , " he added , referencing her push to pass universal healthcare early in her husband 's first presidential term			0
) ride the populist wave @entity137 , a @entity3 cabinet official from the 90s and friend to both @entity140 and @entity3 , told @entity141 that in order to win in 2016 , the former first lady needed to focus on economic populism far more than her husband did in his presidential runs			1
@entity137 said that @entity147 got away by " alluding " to issues like economic inequality and the decline of the middle class			0
for @entity3 , on the other hand , " it 's got to be central			1
" " now the situation has changed , " he said			0
@entity3 has been using populist rhetoric in her speeches and regularly focused on minimum wage and economic inequality while stumping for candidates in 2014 .			0
