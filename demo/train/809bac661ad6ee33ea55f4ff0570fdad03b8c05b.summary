@entity0 -- @entity3 's mother told jurors she filed a wrongful death lawsuit against @entity6 " because i want to know what really happened to my son			1
" @entity9 , likely the final witness as her lawyers conclude their wrongful death case against the pop icon 's last concert promoter , began her testimony friday and will conclude it monday in a @entity0 court			1
" the most difficult thing is to sit here in the court and listen to all the bad things they say about my son , " @entity3 testified			1
the 83 - year - old matriarch of the world 's most famous entertainment family sat on the front row in the small courtroom for most of the 51 previous days of testimony			1
" a lot of the facts that have been said are not the truth , " she said			1
she said contrary to what an @entity6 executive wrote in an e-mail as @entity3 prepared for his comeback concerts in 2009 , her son was not lazy			1
but she especially objected to an e-mail from @entity6 parent company 's general counsel that called @entity3 " a freak " on the same day his company 's top executives were going to his house to sign the " @entity44 " tour contract			1
" he 's not here to speak for himself , " his mother said			1
she said she would " try my best " to speak for the pop icon			2
jurors leaned forward and listened closely during @entity3 's testimony and as her lawyer showed them video of her son performing as a child			1
the lawsuit filed by @entity9 and on behalf of the singer 's three children contends @entity6 is liable for the death of @entity3 because it hired , retained or supervised dr. @entity59			1
the doctor was convicted of involuntary manslaughter			0
@entity6 argues it was @entity3 , not their company , who chose and controlled @entity59 , who admitted giving @entity3 nightly infusions of a surgical anesthetic the coroner ruled killed him			1
its executives had no way of knowing about the dangerous treatments @entity59 was giving @entity3 in the privacy of his bedroom , @entity6 lawyers contend			1
" why are you here ? " @entity3 lawyer @entity76 asked @entity9 " because i want to know what really happened to my son , " she said			1
" and that 's why i am here			2
" @entity76 asked @entity3 how it made her feel to have been asked probing and personal questions about her family by @entity6 lawyer @entity83 during a dozen hours of deposition testimony			1
" it makes me feel real bad , because my son was a very good person , " she said			1
" he loved everybody , he gave to charity , he was in the @entity88 for giving to charity			0
" @entity83 faces the challenge of not appearing unkind to @entity9 while also trying to discredit her testimony			1
" forget it , " she said as she stopped before answering @entity93 's question about why she initially included , and later dropped show director @entity94 as a defendant in her lawsuit			2
" forget what ma'am ? " @entity83 asked			0
@entity3 remained silent for about a minute , staring back at @entity93			1
would it help to reread the question , he asked			0
" no , it would n't be helpful , " @entity3 answered curtly			1
the judge finally ordered the question stricken from the record because the answer involved privileged discussions with her lawyers			0
@entity3 returned to the stand after the lunch break but she told the judge she was tired after just a few more minutes of questioning by @entity93			1
the judge sent jurors home two hours early and will allow @entity9 to resume her testimony monday morning			2
if jurors decide that @entity6 is liable in @entity3 's death , they could award damages based on the loss of the mother 's and children 's relationship with him and the amount of money he was unable to earn because his life was cut short			1
the wrongful death trial is about to get a lot uglier , if defense lawyers live up to the promise of their opening statements			2
@entity6 lawyers this week brought up the child molestation charges against @entity3 and the 2002 incident in which the pop star " dangled " his infant son on a @entity134 hotel balcony			1
touring till 66 ? @entity135 made another appearance in the trial this week -- via a video of her deposition in march			2
jurors saw a clip of @entity6 lawyer @entity83 asking the 15 - year - old what her father told her about his " @entity44 " tour : @entity83 : " did he explain to you how long the tour was going to last ? " @entity151 : " i assume a long time since it was a world tour , but those usually last a long time " @entity83 : " how did you understand it was a world tour ? " @entity151 : " because he told us			0
" @entity83 : " what did he tell you ? " @entity151 : " that we were going around the world on tour			0
" certified public accountant @entity163 , who has managed and audited the business affairs of many top artists , testified wednesday that he is " reasonably certain " that @entity3 would have performed 260 shows around the world as part of his " @entity44 " tour			2
he would have earned $ 890 million over the three years of concerts in @entity171 , @entity172 , @entity173 , @entity174 and @entity175 , @entity163 said			1
@entity3 would have earned at least $ 1.5 billion from touring , endorsements and sponsorships had he not died preparing for his comeback tour , @entity163 said			1
@entity6 's unprecedented sellout of 50 shows scheduled for @entity183 's @entity182 in 2009 and 2010 proved there was " pent - up demand " to see @entity3 live , despite controversies that had tarnished his reputation in the years since his last tour in 1998 , @entity163 said			1
an e-mail from @entity6 ceo @entity6 said fans bought all 750,000 tickets put on sale for 31 shows in march 2009 in just two hours			0
enough buyers were registered to sell out another 100 shows , @entity6 wrote			0
" dude , we 're going to sell out a ridiculous amount of tickets , " @entity6 co-ceo @entity196 wrote in an e-mail			0
" we 've got to get @entity201 to add more shows			0
" @entity3 's manager quickly approved another 19 shows , bringing the total to 50			1
" ten million tickets for the rest of the world ? they would have gobbled up those tickets in seconds , " @entity163 said			0
@entity6 lawyer @entity212 challenged @entity163 's estimate , asking if any other act has ever made as much money on a tour			2
" no , " he said			0
" this would have been a record - breaking world tour			0
" @entity3 would have done another 195 shows over four more world tours before retiring from the road at age 66 , @entity163 predicted			2
@entity83 called @entity163 's estimates " a creation , a fabrication " which suggests @entity3 would have made more after age 50 that he did in the three tours during the " height of his fame			1
" @entity3 never intended to perform after the 50 shows in @entity183 , @entity83 said			2
@entity6 showed jurors a video clip of @entity9 's deposition , in which she said her son would joke that he " did n't want to be moonwalking on stage at 50			1
" " @entity3 said that quite a few years back and he was joking , " his mother explained in her testimony friday			1
" i thought it was funny and most of us said things like that			0
i used to think 50 was very old			0
" in fact , @entity3 was 50 when he signed a three - year contract with @entity6 for his comeback tour , which would have likely included his famous moonwalk dance steps as he performed " @entity248			2
" " we announced that we 're going to have one tour in @entity183 , that 's what was announced , and it was called ' @entity44 , ' meaning in @entity183 , this show is it , " he said			2
" this show is it			0
this is the last thing he 's ever going to do			0
as a result of this being his final performance ever , to be at the @entity182 in @entity183 , there was enormous response , understandably , and therefore we sold 50 shows			0
" with the @entity3 case ending -- which @entity83 called " ridiculous " -- " now we 're going to start to show what actually occurred here , " he said			2
no @entity59 testimony @entity6 's defense team confirmed wednesday that they would not be calling @entity59 to testify			0
" i have no intention of calling him myself , unless it 's requested , your honor , " @entity83 said , replying to the judge 's question about his plans			0
until now , @entity6 lawyers have suggested they might call @entity59 , who is serving a four - year jail sentence for involuntary manslaughter , to the witness stand			0
@entity59 's lawyer gave the @entity3 and @entity6 lawyers a sworn statement from the doctor before the trial began stating that he would invoke his constitutional protection against self - incrimination by refusing to answer questions if subpoenaed			1
see you in september jurors , who were told when the trial started in april that it could end sometime in august , appeared unfazed when @entity289 judge @entity288 told them this week that it is likely to extend into mid-september			0
@entity83 estimated this week that he needs about 30 days in court to present his defense after the plaintiffs rest			0
the jurors often have laughed and smiled in reaction to testimony and the interplay between @entity3 lead lawyer @entity76 , the judge and the @entity6 defense team			2
for example , when @entity288 ordered @entity76 to turn around and face the bench while @entity6 attorney @entity212 cross-examined @entity301 , jurors seemed amused			0
@entity76 , whose seat was just in front of @entity306 's lectern , had been looking directly up at her at close range			0
there were no laughs in the hallway after court on tuesday when @entity76 and @entity83 exchanged words			0
the two lawyers were standing about 15 feet apart , each talking to reporters , when they began directing their words at each other			0
the court clerk interrupted the heated conversation , threatening to summon deputies			0
@entity288 lectured the lawyers in her chambers the next morning and imposed new rules that bar them from speaking to journalists in the hallway .			0
