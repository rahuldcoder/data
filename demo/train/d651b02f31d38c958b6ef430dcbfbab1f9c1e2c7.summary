-- in the wake of @entity3 's memorial service , the key question of how the pop superstar died remains unanswered , awaiting an official report from the @entity8 coroner			2
@entity3 , at 25 , graced the cover of " @entity10			2
" the right photo shows him more than two decades later			2
but other mysteries abound , particularly related to @entity3 's appearance , which changed dramatically from his early adulthood			2
his features changed , and the color of his skin lightened significantly over the last two decades of his life			1
when the face of the most recognizable entertainer in the world faded to near alabaster , the transformation struck a sensitive cultural spot			0
it intrigued and even offended people , spawning numerous articles and blog posts speculating about his metamorphosis			1
this week , a source involved with the investigation into @entity3 's death said the singer 's body was " lily white from head to toe			0
" and another source said @entity3 had " paper - white skin			1
as white as a white t - shirt			0
" the singer denied changing his skin color for vanity reasons and repeatedly asserted that he had a disease called vitiligo , in which the immune system attacks cells that produce melanin , the pigment that determines skin color			1
the condition results in milky white spots			1
for some patients , the discolored spots can spread entirely across the body , leaving only freckles of the original skin color , although this is not very common , experts said			1
@entity3 told @entity60 in a 1993 interview , " i 'm a black @entity62			0
i am proud to be a black @entity62			0
i am proud of my race , and i am proud of who i am			0
i have a lot of pride and dignity of who i am			0
" i have a skin disorder that destroys the pigmentation of the skin			1
it 's something i can not help			0
when people make up stories that i do n't like who i am , it hurts me , " @entity3 told @entity60			1
@entity3 's claims that he had vitiligo elicited both empathy and skepticism			1
those familiar with the skin condition said vitiligo is commonly misunderstood because of its rarity			1
it affects approximately 1 percent of the world 's population , according to the @entity87			0
" i have to wear sleeves and carry an umbrella , " said @entity88 , who wrote a memoir called " @entity90 , " which discusses his physical and mental struggles as an @entity62 man whose skin changes because of vitiligo			1
" it totally makes sense to me			0
" and he even shared a common habit as the @entity3 " i got [ white spots ] on one of my hands , so i used to wear a glove to hold a microphone , " said @entity88 , an @entity101 - winning tv news broadcaster in @entity102 , @entity103			0
he first noticed white spots on his scalp when he was 25			0
then the spots appeared on his hands			0
" before i got this , i thought , ' what 's up with @entity3 ? ' " @entity88 said			0
" then i get the disease , and it 's like , ' holy crap , there really is a disease called vitiligo , and it does what ? ' " making assumptions about why or how a person 's skin color changed is " not malicious ignorance , but it is definitely ignorance , " @entity88 said			1
@entity126 affects people of all races , but it is more visible in people with darker skin			1
the cause of the disorder is unknown , although family history plays a role			0
topical ointments such as corticosteroids and oral medicine combined with ultraviolet light therapies are used to restore pigment to the skin			1
these treatments often have side effects including abnormal hair growth , thinning and over-darkening of the skin			1
they can be about 60 to 70 percent successful , said dr. @entity148 , a dermatologist who specializes in skin color disorders at @entity150 in @entity151 , @entity152			1
" the problem with vitiligo is , you end up with two colors , " said @entity148 , a board member with the @entity153			1
" everyone stares , wonders what 's going on , and people ask if you had a burn			1
kids ask what 's wrong with you			0
it takes a tough soul to deal with that and not be affected			0
" he recalled one patient , an @entity62 - @entity62 woman with vitiligo who had patches across her hands and face			1
when she shopped in the grocery store , she would be followed , and every bit of produce and item she touched would be thrown away , he said			0
if treatment to restore the patient 's natural color fails and the majority of a person 's body is discolored , the next option is to lighten his or her skin to match the spots			1
" people want to be their own color , " @entity148 said			1
" most of the time , most want to be their own color , but if they ca n't , the second best is , ' look , i 'll be one color , and i 'll be white			0
' " @entity148 never treated @entity3 but said the singer 's use of the gloves and lipstick was consistent with the patterns of vitiligo , since the spots frequently first appear on the hands and face , including the lips			2
he said @entity3 's representatives once reached out to several dermatologists , including him , to hold a symposium on vitiligo at the @entity207 , but those plans never materialized			2
despite such statements , the constant changes in his face -- as it became narrower and paler -- baffled and caused some unease			0
bleaching or lightening one 's skin for cosmetic reasons is much rarer in the @entity218 than in @entity219 , @entity62 and @entity221 nations , dermatologists said			1
in some countries , people use over-the - counter and bootleg products -- some of which contain potentially toxic chemicals -- to lighten their skin			1
the controversial practice has been viewed as the psychological legacy of racism , where light skin was valued over darker skin			2
in the @entity218 , lightening ointments are prescribed for spot treatments for scars , acne pits or discolored marks , said dr. @entity240 , a dermatologist at the @entity241			1
there is no surgery to lighten the skin			2
in the @entity218 , a powerful medication called @entity246 , also known as monobenzene , can be used to treat extreme cases of vitiligo			1
" it 's important to understand that this product actually removes pigment ( not just lightens ) , which is more like being an albino , " wrote dr. @entity250 , a cosmetic dermatologic surgeon and director of the @entity252 in @entity253 , @entity254			2
" @entity260 skin still has pigment even though it 's ' white ' -- skin treated with @entity246 has no pigment			1
" the process , though painless , is so tedious and lengthy that most people use @entity246 only on the visible areas of their body , such as their face , neck and arms , @entity148 said			2
side effects include irritated , dry or itchy skin , and the results are permanent			2
the person applies the medication once a day , and it could take six months to two years to take away the coloring			0
@entity148 said he has heard of only one or two people who administered the ointment over their entire bodies ; those processes took five to eight years			2
it leaves the person extremely sensitive to the sun. it 's a decision that @entity88 may have to make one day			0
none of the treatments to bring back his natural pigment has worked			2
his face has become about 35 to 40 percent white , and he uses heavy makeup to even out the spots when he appears on television			0
" i would have to consider it as an option , " @entity88 said of whether he would consider depigmentation if the discolored spots spread			0
" when it gets to that point , i 'll make that decision			0
right now , i 'm not there yet			0
" " i 'm a dark - skinned african - american and am proud of that			0
it would be really weird not to have any pigment at all			2

those familiar with vitiligo say condition is commonly misunderstood
skin lightening practiced in other countries , not as *widespread* in @entity218
treatment to remove pigment is available only to people with extreme vitiligo
