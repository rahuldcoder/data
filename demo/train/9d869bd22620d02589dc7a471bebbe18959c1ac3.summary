grand jury dismissal of charges against police officers in the july 17 , 2014 , chokehold death of @entity4 in @entity5 has returned racism to the forefront of the @entity9 political debate			1
the entrance of @entity12 supreme leader @entity11 into the fray , with tweets condemning @entity9 police and racism and using the hashtag # blacklivesmatter , has turned the debate into a farce			1
it 's the equivalent of @entity21 condemning anti-semitism or @entity24 dictator @entity23 condemning prison overcrowding			2
but perhaps @entity11 's tweets can be a teachable moment , for @entity12 and @entity9 both , about racism and injustice in @entity12			1
in @entity9 , journalists discuss racism , politicians debate it and academics study it , because @entity9 enjoy free speech , a free press and can speak truth to power without fear or risk of torture			1
in the months preceding the @entity42 's 1979 ouster , @entity12 joined the revolution because they were tired of dictatorship , wanted democracy , and chafed under the @entity46 , the @entity42 's dictatorship			2
revolutionary leader @entity48 rallied @entity12 to his cause			2
before his return to @entity12 , @entity48 spoke the language of social justice and disavowed any interest in personal power			2
after the success of his revolution , @entity48 changed course			0
he may have executed many top - ranking @entity46 officers , but he soon took back their deputies to build the @entity60 ( or @entity61 ) , a new intelligence service different only in name			0
@entity12 might be disillusioned with the regime 's revolutionary fervor , but @entity11 , his top deputies and the @entity67 are not			1
whether it 's @entity69 or @entity70 , @entity12 prisons can make their @entity9 counterparts look like @entity73 while many @entity75 commentators consider new @entity12 president @entity77 a reformer , he is anything but			1
sure , he purged @entity67 veterans from his cabinet , but he replaced them not with liberals but with @entity60 veterans			0
the increasing rate of public executions since @entity77 took office shows that neither justice nor compassion are high priority values			0
what about racism ? here , too , @entity12 might learn a lesson from @entity9 about tolerance and honest introspection			1
some of these themes were explored tangentially in the 1986 @entity12 art house drama , " @entity96			2
" after the dark - skinned title character flees war and finds himself on a farm in northern @entity12 , the woman who finds him tries to scrub the darkness off his skin ( many southern @entity12 have dark skin , in part a legacy of the east african slave trade )			0
the irony here is that @entity12 's minister of culture at the time , one @entity112 , initially banned the film for its negative depiction of war and its feminist overtones			1
shining a spotlight on @entity12 racism is the rule rather than the exception			1
@entity121 , a black - faced minstrel or clown , is a fixture in @entity126 gatherings in @entity12			0
in a november 11 , 2008 , commentary , the @entity127 , an outlet close to then - president @entity129 called @entity9 president @entity131 a " house slave			0
" after @entity131 's election , @entity133 , a daily newspaper close to @entity12 's @entity135 and intelligence services , dismissed @entity131 as " a black immigrant			1
" and while the @entity67 ' weekly , @entity141 - e @entity140 , declared after @entity131 's election that " a dark person rises to remove darkness from @entity9 , " it then continued to criticize him for hiring a @entity145 chief of staff			2
nor are blacks alone targeted			0
while some @entity12 bend over backward to depict @entity12 as a tolerant community and home to the second largest jewish community in the @entity150 , they omit that this community is only one - sixth the size of what it was before the revolution , and declining steadily against the backdrop of both official and unofficial discrimination			0
repeated rhetoric about @entity159 being a cancer — sometimes without any differentiation between @entity145 and @entity159 — takes a toll			0
in 2006 , an @entity12 newspaper published a cartoon depicting @entity165 , @entity12 's largest ethnic minority , as cockroaches			1
in 2012 , @entity12 authorities in @entity169 banned @entity170 from a public park			0
@entity12 @entity172 fare little better			0
@entity131 is right to say that the @entity9 willingness to confront problems head - on " should make us optimistic			0
" as a @entity176 peace laureate and an important voice on the world stage , @entity131 might cast moral and cultural equivalence aside and use his bully pulpit to respond to @entity11 , reminding the @entity12 leader that the @entity9 is far less racist than @entity12 .			1

@entity12 's supreme leader @entity11 posts tweets condemning @entity9 police , racism
@entity187 : his action was *ridiculous* , but it serves as a teachable moment
in @entity9 , we can speak truth to power without fear or risk of torture , not so with @entity12
@entity187 : shining a spotlight on @entity12 racism is the rule rather than the exception
