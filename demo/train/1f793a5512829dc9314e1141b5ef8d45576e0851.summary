@entity0 , @entity1 of the @entity9 in eastern @entity1			0
the e-mails , dating back to 1996 , were published on web sites run by climate change skeptics who claim efforts had been made to manipulate data to exaggerate the threat of global warming			1
the head of the @entity8 , professor @entity18 , stepped down from his post while reviews were conducted			1
it was announced wednesday that @entity18 would return to the role of director of research at the university after an independent review cleared the @entity8 of manipulating or falsifying data			1
" we concluded that these behaviors did not damage our judgment of the integrity , the honesty , the rigor with which they had operated as scientists , " said the review 's chairman @entity27			1
in early july , an investigation by @entity39 into one of the authors of the e-mails , professor @entity43 , found that he had not strayed from accepted practices for " proposing , reporting or conducting research			1
" who is the @entity8 ? the @entity8 is one of the world 's leading research bodies on natural and human - induced climate change and has developed a number of the data sets widely used in climate research , including the global temperature record used to monitor the state of the climate system			1
it played a key role in the @entity59 's ( @entity59 ) @entity58 in 2007 -- a collaboration between the @entity61 and @entity62 ( @entity62 ) -- considered to be the most authoritative report of its kind			0
since the e-mail scandal broke , the credibility of the @entity59 has been brought into question			0
in january , the panel admitted its assessment report had wrongly stated that the @entity72 glaciers would disappear by 2035			0
how was the climate data allegedly manipulated ? in one particular e-mail , professor @entity18 relates to the preparation of a figure for the @entity78 on the @entity79 in 1999			1
he writes , " i 've just completed ' @entity81 trick ' of adding in the real temps to each series for the last 20 years ... to hide the decline			0
" the alleged ' @entity86 ' e-mails according to critics , this " trick " worked in the following way : when temperature readings taken from tree rings showed an apparent decline in temperatures from the 1980s to the present , the researchers added in measurements taken later by more modern instruments , which gave them the answer they wanted			2
what was the @entity8 's response ? in a statement posted on the university 's web site late last year , the @entity8 said the use of the word " trick " was not intended to imply a deception			0
it said : " the requirement for the @entity78 was for up - to - date evidence showing how temperatures may have changed over the last 1,000 years			0
" to produce temperature series that were completely up - to - date ( i.e. through to 1999 ) it was necessary to combine the temperature reconstructions with the instrumental record , because the temperature reconstructions from proxy data ( such as tree rings ) ended many years earlier whereas the instrumental record is updated every month			0
" the statement went on to say the illegally obtained e-mails have been " taken out of context and misinterpreted " as evidence that @entity8 manipulated climate data to present an unrealistic picture of global warming			1
it added that " this conclusion is entirely unfounded and the evidence from @entity8 research is entirely consistent with independent evidence assembled by various research groups around the world			2
" it called for an independent review to be set up , and since late 2009 , the team , led by sir @entity27 , has been examining dozens of submissions			1
what impact did ' @entity86 ' have on the case for global warming ? the e-mails appeared just weeks before the @entity143 conference on @entity144 held in @entity145 in december 2009			1
at the time , many climate change experts claimed the files were stolen in an attempt to undermine the talks			2
" given the wide - ranging nature of change that is likely to be taken in hand , some naturally find it inconvenient to accept its inevitability , " @entity59 chairman @entity150 told reporters in the @entity153 capital			0
" the recent incident of stealing the e-mails of scientists at the @entity9 shows that some would go to the extent of carrying out illegal acts , perhaps in an attempt to discredit the @entity59			2
" after its completion , the december @entity145 climate conference was widely seen to have failed in its aim of agreeing a global deal on climate change			2
@entity2 's @entity173 contributed to this report .			0

in november 2009 , more than 1,000 e-mails were published *online*
climate skeptics claimed e-mails showed case for global warming had been exaggerated
independent review published wednesday cleared scientists of *wrongdoing*
