editor 's note : @entity2 , this year 's @entity4 " @entity5 " winner , describes the heartbreaking day when she decided to say good - bye to her newborn son , who was born prematurely			1
( @entity4 ) -- sitting in the newborn intensive care unit five years ago , i could feel my heart pound in my chest and my throat tighten in panic at the sight of my son			1
@entity4 : how to make positive changes in your life the doctor had come to my bedside that morning and told me that @entity21 had suffered through a difficult night			1
but that did n't remotely prepare me for what i now witnessed			1
alarms were ringing , the numbers on his monitors plummeting			1
all the while , my beautiful boy lay there , apparently peaceful , as chaos surrounded him			1
what frightened me most was that nobody rushed to his side			1
this state of frenzy , it seemed , was the status quo for our boy , and it was only my husband , @entity42 , and i who were distraught			1
@entity4 : how to tell if someone is lying @entity21 was just three days old			1
i had developed preeclampsia during my pregnancy and spent the last several weeks in the hospital , desperately trying to keep him inside and growing			1
finally , at 27 weeks , my body decided that it could do no more			1
the doctors rushed me to the operating room , my frightened husband at my side , and delivered our tiny baby by @entity55			1
he was one pound , 12 ounces and just 12 inches long			1
although he was very early and very small , i believed in him			1
i knew that he would thrive			1
@entity4 : how to stop procrastinating now @entity42 and i sat at his bedside			1
after what felt like forever but was only a few minutes , the nurse approached us			1
she discussed some of @entity21 's challenges and went to get his doctor			1
we waited , choking back fear and praying for a miracle			1
@entity4 : 24 nutritious and tasty snacks when the doctor came in , she was calm and gentle			1
i can not remember her name or her face			2
but what i remember is this : she began to describe to us the difficulties that @entity21 had faced in the last eight hours , the hours during which i had slept peacefully , aided by pain medicine and a false sense of security			2
he had suffered an intra-ventricular hemorrhage , or @entity82 , which is bleeding in the ventricles of the brain			1
there are four types , or grades , of severity , the doctor said , and she began to explain the complications related to each type			2
@entity4 : how to snack smarter i remember , too , how time warped as she talked on and on about the types			1
it was like a trick they do in movies , clock hands racing while someone drones in slow motion			2
each time she described a grade , i expected her to stop and tell us that this was the type of @entity82 that @entity21 had had			2
at last , she mentioned a grade 4 hemorrhage , and she swallowed hard around the words			1
fleetingly , my heart ached for this doctor who had to deliver such news to us , who had to tell us about the permanent damage that this hemorrhage was causing our son			1
@entity4 : 8 steps to a happier family life when she was finally , mercifully finished telling us what @entity21 was up against , we just sat there in shock			1
she gently explained that we could take time to make some decisions about how we would like to proceed with treatment and left us with our son			1
in the quiet of the newborn intensive care unit , i could feel the sobs building inside me			1
" @entity132 , " i begged my husband as he wheeled me back to my room			2
once there , we both collapsed , allowing ourselves to release the grief behind this closed door			2
it did n't seem possible that this baby could fail , not this little boy who had spent the last many weeks dancing joyfully on my bladder			2
not the feisty guy who had such bursts of energy inside my belly each day			2
not our son , whom we had named years in advance , after the power of being renewed by fire			1
and , yet , here we were			2
as i was lying in my hospital bed in the weeks before @entity21 was born , i had often talked to him			2
i told him my fears about his health			2
i told him about my love for him			2
i cried many , many tears			2
one of my biggest fears , i told him , was that he would be born and spend hours being poked with needles and feeling nothing but anguish			2
while he still kicked inside me , i told him that if he needed to let go , if he was n't strong enough for this life , i could handle it			2
especially if it meant that he could avoid being in pain			2
it was n't going to be that way			2
@entity42 and i had never really discussed the worst possibilities for our son , but we had decided a while back that whatever happened , we would be the ones to decide how @entity21 's care proceeded			1
now was the time to face that decision			0
while @entity21 still kicked inside me , i told him that if he needed to let go , if he was n't strong enough for this life , i could handle it			0
especially if it meant that he could avoid being in pain			0
what we both knew was that we loved this little boy more than anything we had ever known before			0
we discussed the diagnosis we had been given and what that would mean for his , and our , future			0
and i knew this : my greatest fear for @entity21 was right before me , coming true inside these walls where life - and - death choices were made every day			0
the truth is , it did n't take long for @entity42 and me to decide that what we wanted was to keep our son comfortable			1
i thought of his tiny body in the incubator , respirator in place , blood - pressure cuff pumping , needles and catheters and scans and transfusions			0
it was not how we wanted him to live			0
what we wanted more than anything was for him to live the time that he had left knowing our touch , knowing our love , feeling that we were with him , no matter what			0
we called the few people we could bear to speak with and shared the news			0
we cried and cried and tried to hold each other , though i was too sore from my own surgery and weeks of bed rest to move into any comfortable position in my husband 's arms			1
when we were calm , we went back to @entity21 's bedside			1
the doctor returned , and we told her that we did not want to continue his life support			0
we asked her if we could find a place to sit and rock him , a private place to say our good - byes and hold him tight			0
she did n't question our decision for one moment			0
she just ushered us to an empty room and told us that she was going to unhook the baby from his machinery			0
when the nurse brought my baby back into the room , it was the hardest moment of my life			0
harder than hearing his diagnosis			0
harder than making the decision to stop treatment			0
here he was , our sweet little peanut , without any of the lifesaving equipment that he needed to keep him alive			0
still , he rested peacefully in his tiny blanket and hat			0
when the nurse handed him to me for the first time , i fully realized how little , how light he really was			0
my husband and i held him and rocked him , petted him and cooed over him as all new parents do			1
the only difference being that our hello would also serve as a goodbye			0
i will always treasure the minutes we spent together in that room			0
i willed my son to know that no matter how hard it was , i was right here			1
i would not leave his side			0
most of those momentsâ € ” his final momentsâ € ” i keep inside my heart and have never shared with anyone			0
they belong to us , @entity21 and @entity42 and me			0
the nurse stayed close by , and , eventually , she let us know that @entity21 had passed			0
his tiny , little spirit had flown from a body that could n't hold him			0
there was no sign from him , ever , in either life or death			0
in the days and years since his death , i have turned it all over and over in my head			0
i no longer ask why			0
things , bad things , happen to people every day			0
i have doubted our decision at times , but i know that those thoughts come from fear			0
in my heart of hearts , i know that we did the best thing we could for our child			0
and only with this distance can i see that , perhaps , he did the best he could for me , too			0
by not listening to me and letting go before his birth , he gave me the gift of being his mother			0
and that is a gift i would never give up , no matter how much pain came along with the package			0
