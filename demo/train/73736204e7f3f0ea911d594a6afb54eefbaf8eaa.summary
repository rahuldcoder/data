the atrocious murder of @entity1 puts the @entity2 and in particular prime minister @entity4 front and center in the evolving battle against @entity7			1
it 's not as though he is short of work , with a referendum in @entity12 this week and a problematic relationship with the @entity14 among current elections next year dominating a crowded schedule			0
but the pm must now mobilize the @entity2 public for another campaign in @entity19 , mindful that the last one was widely opposed			1
revulsion at the beheading of three hostages will likely provide a bedrock of support			0
there are a wide variety of options including : surveillance and support operations , limited airstrikes against @entity7 positions in @entity19 , extending those airstrikes to @entity7 targets in @entity34 or even inserting @entity35 in support of the @entity34 resistance , @entity19 @entity38 or the @entity19 military			1
@entity4 has been forthright about his government 's determination to take down @entity7 , saying at the weekend : " step by step we will drive back , dismantle and ultimately destroy @entity7 [ also used as an acronym for the group ] and what it stands for			2
we will do so in a calm , deliberate way but with an iron determination			0
" he added : " we will do everything in our power to hunt down these murderers and ensure they face justice , however long it takes			0
" " ultimately " and " however long it takes " imply an indefinite campaign			0
implying the @entity2 would join in air strikes , @entity2 defense minister @entity56 has told @entity59 personnel involved in surveillance flights : " there may well now be in the next few weeks and months other ways that we may need to help save life and protect people			1
" and that 's just one element of this strategy			0
@entity4 has been expansive about prodding the @entity19 government toward being more inclusive , saying it " badly needs to get itself together so it can represent all of the country			1
" he is in favor of arming the @entity38 , which in itself may be at odds with the aim of a unified @entity19 , about mobilizing @entity79 states as part of a broad coalition to squeeze @entity7 and about revitalizing moderate rebel groups in @entity34			1
the means and the goals of this multi-faceted campaign are yet to be fleshed out			0
in the words of his spokesman last week , " in terms of specific decisions about participation in further action , we are not at the stage of taking those decisions			0
" for example , @entity4 has been cautious about whether air strikes might be extended to @entity34			1
@entity4 maintains that " president [ @entity98 has committed war crimes on his own people and is therefore illegitimate			2
" but other parties in @entity2 are wary of air strikes in @entity34 , regarding them as dubious in international law			1
and many commentators believe some sort of understanding or accommodation with the @entity98 regime is an essential condition of effective action against @entity7 strongholds in @entity114 and @entity115 provinces			0
even @entity2 's foreign secretary , @entity116 , was out of step with @entity118 last week			2
" let me be clear , @entity2 will not be taking part in air strikes in @entity34 , " he told a news conference in @entity120			1
hours later the pm 's office said nothing had been ruled out			0
one conservative mp , @entity124 , who is a member of the @entity125 , cautioned : " air strikes into @entity34 are fraught with risks			1
the legal , technical and military differences between strikes in @entity19 and @entity34 are marked			1
the @entity2 should be advising caution			2
" but on sunday came the first hint that the @entity131 would be looking to allies for the @entity34 part of the campaign			2
secretary of state @entity135 told @entity136 : " we are going to do what they [ the @entity34 ] have n't done , what they had plenty of opportunity to do , which is to take on @entity7 and to degrade it and eliminate it as a threat			2
" " we will do that with allies , " he added			0
but @entity2 's military is already stretched			1
units are still deployed in @entity148 and the armed forces are hurting from a squeeze on defense spending			1
the @entity152 , a think - tank on military issues , concluded in a report this month that " on current spending plans and growth projections ...			2
@entity2 defense spending is set to fall below the @entity159 2 per cent target for the first time next financial year , to an estimated 1.88 per cent of gdp in 2015/16			1
" @entity2 planes would probably have to operate from @entity164 , flying a long circuitous route over @entity166 to targets in northern @entity19			1
@entity159 flew 14,000 sorties in @entity169 to degrade the @entity171 regime			0
destroying @entity7 may not be such a protracted effort , but it would be more than a commitment of a few weeks			0
and over @entity34 , planes would face the risk of encountering the @entity34 air force and air defenses			2
a @entity2 pilot falling into the hands of @entity7 or the @entity34 regime is the stuff of nightmares			1
there is the additional dilemma that any military action may hasten more beheadings of hostages , with another @entity2 citizen possibly the next victim			1
and the coalition being mobilized is -- at best -- disparate , including 10 members of @entity159 and middle eastern states , including @entity194 and @entity195			0
the division of labor among these states is yet to be worked out , though @entity131 officials are suggesting @entity79 states may provide air power and @entity135 pronounced himself " extremely encouraged " by the response from governments on his latest tour of the region			0
some @entity2 politicians are more skeptical			2
the veteran @entity207 mp , @entity207 , warned last month that " a unified approach will be essential with no room for dissent or compromise between countries			0
the jihadists of @entity214 [ the @entity215 , as it calls itself ] will most certainly test political resolve as well as security challenges			0
" public support even before the murder of @entity1 , opinion in @entity2 was moving toward air strikes			1
a @entity223 poll for the independent newspaper at the end of august found that 35 % backing , with 50 % opposed			0
a week later that support had nearly doubled , according to a poll by @entity229 for the @entity230			0
and 27 % said they would support @entity35 on the ground			0
@entity4 enjoys broad support for the domestic part of his anti-isis platform , which may include legislation to prevent suspected @entity2 extremists from traveling to @entity19 and @entity34 and stopping those already there from coming home			1
polls suggest public support higher than 80 % for such moves			0
but identifying and tracking such people is a tall order -- and @entity2 military action could incite some of the several hundred @entity2 citizens thought to be fighting in @entity34 and @entity19 to bring terror home			1
a successful campaign over several months that squeezed @entity7 into insignificance could bring political rewards at home			2
@entity4 may be able to claim his decisive leadership was instrumental in facing down the world 's most dangerous terror group , incidentally deflecting attention from thorny issues like immigration and @entity257 , where his @entity258 is under pressure from the insurgent @entity2 @entity261			1
but with a general election due by may next year , taking on @entity7 is fraught with peril for the @entity2 pm .			0

@entity264 mobilizing @entity2 public for new campaign in @entity19 , mindful last one was widely opposed
@entity4 has been cautious about whether air strikes might be extended to @entity34
@entity2 military is stretched . units still deployed in @entity148 , defense spending is squeezed
dilemma is that any military action may hasten more beheadings of hostages , says @entity279
