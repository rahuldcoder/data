-- in @entity3 , not all rebels carry guns , some carry cameras			1
@entity6 heads up @entity7 , a collective of @entity3 filmmakers who are hoping to affect change in how the @entity3 conflict is portrayed , both by president @entity12 and the media at large			1
@entity7 's members -- all volunteer , all anonymous -- create short films , generally two to five minutes long , in which they give a voice to ordinary citizens			1
they try to capture the day - to - day lives of @entity3 , whether they live inside the country , in a nearby refugee camp , or further abroad in exile			1
after editing , the films are posted to video - sharing site @entity25 every friday			1
" the idea is to make films that allow the universal viewer to feel something without knowing anything about @entity3 , " says @entity6			1
the film 's subjects can be anybody -- a soldier with the @entity36 , a widowed shopkeeper or a young woman arguing her right not to wear a veil			2
they , too , are anonymous ; their names are never revealed , nor are their locations			2
" we try to make the viewer ask himself questions			2
we want to make him reconsider the representation of this conflict , " says @entity6			0
" there are anonymous men and women who are fighting for their freedom , no matter if they are @entity51 or @entity52 , soldiers or loyalists			0
we just focus on the shared humanity and deep humanity that is in everyone			0
" who shapes the narrative ? @entity6 believes that president @entity12 has been very savvy when it comes to managing his image and that of the war			1
a prime example is how the @entity3 leader has depicted all rebels as " terrorists "			1
" @entity12 is saying , ' i am a good guy			1
i may be a dictator , but i am a gentleman fighting against @entity69			0
you may not like me , but support me , because we have the same enemy			0
' he 's succeeding in making the world believe that 's the case , " he says			0
since the conflict started over three years ago , @entity12 has set up an @entity78 account that depicts him as the benevolent dictator -- kissing babies and waving to cheering crowds			1
he has also allegedly sought to control the information that leaves his country through internet blackouts , while the @entity85 has tried to manage public opinion by hacking the websites and social media accounts of major news organizations , including the @entity90 and @entity91 , and infiltrating them with @entity93 missives			0
" we do n't face the same dangers as journalists or citizen reporters , and we 're not fighting with weapons , but the regime views everyone who carries a camera as an enemy , so it 's still very , very dangerous , " says @entity94			2
" in @entity3 , the image can kill			1
" @entity6 equates @entity7 with snipers , training their sights on the regime			1
" when we started in 2010 , in order to film anything in @entity3 , you had to ask permission from the censors , " he says			1
" our idea was that if we used the internet , and did n't chose political subjects openly , the censor would n't see anything			0
" making it difficult to care @entity7 does n't rely on violence to get the message across			1
for @entity6 , a stronger message is one that does n't involve bloodshed			0
" the mainstream media relies on images of people who have been wounded or killed , but then we as a people are associated with misery			0
it 's voyeurism , " says @entity6			0
" you make people more accepting of the destruction			0
they viewer thinks , ' ok , they are dying , but they are not like me			0
' we believe that the only way to protect people is to show their image with dignity			0
once you see them that way , you can feel their humanity , and you can not accept the situation as easily			0
" getting noticed @entity7 is starting to garner some attention of its own			2
" of @entity158 and @entity159 , " a film in which a soldier in the @entity36 confesses to killing an innocent man , won the @entity156 at the @entity157			2
a selection of shorts were also screened in @entity162 as part of the @entity164 film festival			2
" it 's important for us that we get recognized as film makers by our colleagues around the world , because this protects us from political tutelage , " says @entity6 .			2
