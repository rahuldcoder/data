@entity0 , @entity1 -- the rubble that blankets much of @entity4 delivers the deadly verdict on decades of inadequate construction in my home nation			0
my siblings were spared ; their house was not destroyed , but my apartment back home collapsed			0
the destruction is of stupefying proportion			0
my heart cries out to my @entity17 brothers and sisters who are enduring so much			1
i had long known that @entity17 was vulnerable -- it had been hit before , in 1751 , 1771 and 1842			1
i anticipated that if it happened again , damages and loss of life would be substantial , due to the poor quality of the built environment			0
some local and foreign scientists were talking about the eventuality of a major quake , but not enough attention was paid to their warnings , and eventually many saw it as only a remote possibility			2
i decided to study earthquake engineering , hoping that i would have time to get the education in designing against earthquakes , would get hands - on experience , share the knowledge with engineers back home , and advocate for the adoption of building codes and the integration of sound design criteria against such occurrences			1
sadly , i ran out of time			0
i know that it is critical that my country now examine what steps ought to be taken to prevent such massive loss of life in the future			0
this is my humble contribution to this process			0
much has been written about why the earthquake flattened whole communities			0
there was the flouting , or just ignorance , of international building codes developed by engineers to provide a framework in construction engineering and design , especially important in a country so susceptible to what we call " multiple hazards " -- earthquakes , hurricanes , storm surges , tsunami			1
no such building code exists in @entity17			1
there was the low - cost unreinforced masonry , or barely reinforced concrete structures that have dominated @entity17 's landscape ; the anarchic construction that flourished in tightly - packed @entity4 , suffocating the city and further deteriorating its already degraded environment as builders frantically mined and extracted construction materials from its mountainsides			1
there was construction in obviously unsuitable areas , such as wetlands and unstable and eroded mountain flanks -- structures there could not possibly sustain the large deformation imposed by the earthquake			0
very few buildings were designed by architects and engineers ; most were built with no construction standards -- by wealthy and poor alike			1
enforcement of construction permits and site inspections has been lax			0
hardly any structure met the minimum requirements to resist the type of horizontal force generated by an earthquake of that magnitude			2
the ones still standing may just be lucky			0
as tragic as this event is , it is also an opportunity to start from scratch and rebuild the country in a planned and orderly fashion			0
this calls for a comprehensive urban - development plan			1
there must be an emphasis on the development of model cities in @entity17 , which may intelligently , yet safely , integrate architectural local features -- such as building fa√ßades mimicking the fretted wood and intricate latticework that ornamented traditional " gingerbread " houses favored by tourists in the 1950s -- to lure visitors and stoke an economic rebirth			2
the government also must adopt and enforce a comprehensive set of construction codes and regulations with a multi-hazard focus			1
engineers must think globally while designing and building structures that protect life in such an array of hazards			0
multi-hazard engineering is emerging as a cost - effective solution to engineering design and construction issues in countries like @entity17 , where several natural or man - made hazards are involved			1
and while it is a new concept that has n't been widely applied yet ( it 's an approach championed at my university , and by the federally funded @entity151 , or @entity151 ) , this multi-hazard focus is imperative in our case			1
@entity17 's building codes must be based on existing , well - tested research and emphasize the necessity for peer - reviewed design as an embedded layer of safety in the design process			1
for reasons of proximity and the role that the @entity165 is playing in the earthquake 's aftermath , it would be reasonable for @entity17 to base building codes on those used in the @entity165 and in @entity165 territories like @entity171 , which share similar exposure and vulnerability , for example , to annual tropical storms or earthquakes			1
beyond this , the @entity17 authorities must provide the local and international private sectors with incentives to invest in the development of affordable housing for the survivors , through tax cuts or tax payment deferments and by making public lands available during the reconstruction efforts			1
these housing projects would put people back to work and support the housing market , as realtors and financial institutions will be needed			0
they would also provide hands - on experience to local engineers , who will need help from the international community as they learn skills required for designing multi-hazard structures to code , while providing a basis to hold them accountable in case of gross malpractice			2
this financial and intellectual collaboration can extend to developing a curriculum in multi-hazard engineering that can be required in engineering schools both in private and state institutions in @entity17 , and sanctioned by standardized mandatory certification tests for graduating engineers and in educational sessions for practicing engineers			1
of course , a wider reconstruction project must include the new development of lifelines that provide vital emergency response and recovery : health care facilities , communication , electric power , liquid fuel , natural gas , transportation ( airports , highways , ports , rail and transit ) , water , and wastewater			0
this is critical , considering that the rescue efforts on the ground right now are hindered by the damage sustained by many of those systems			0
in the wake of such destruction , the construction sector can be the main driver for sustainable economic development in @entity17			2
while it should n't have taken such a horrific event to get there , this can be a way to pay tribute to the @entity17 people who have demonstrated such resilience in adversity , and to give hope to the families of the countless loved ones who have lost their lives or are injured			2
reversing the course of this catastrophe is going to be a herculean task , requiring intense resources and a multidisciplinary approach with a strong multi-hazard focus			2
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity261 .			2

@entity17 @entity261 says he studied earthquake engineering in anticipation of such a disaster
he says @entity17 's buildings are terribly designed to resist quake damage
@entity17 needs comprehensive urban - planning approach in reconstruction , he says
@entity261 : to rebuild , need multi-hazard engineering , strict codes , education and money
