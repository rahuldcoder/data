-- @entity1 is one of the poorest countries on earth with an economy based on agriculture but there is one industry that 's booming -- international child adoptions			1
extreme poverty combined with one of the world 's highest birth rates is creating a pressure cooker where many children are abandoned or put up for adoption			2
and there are also fears that as the adoption numbers grow more needs to be done to prevent children being exploited			2
children -- sometimes orphans , sometimes just with parents unable to care for them -- find themselves taken into @entity1 's child welfare system			1
for some this can mean foster care or a temporary home			0
for others it is the first step on a road that will lead to adoption and a new life			2
while traditional adoption hotspots are becoming less attractive -- @entity33 has banned @entity34 from adopting children , and it can take years to navigate @entity37 's adoption bureaucracy -- @entity1 is seen as a quick and easy alternative for prospective parents			1
opinion : @entity33 's adoption ban harms kids in @entity1 , the adoption process can take just a few months to complete			1
the country is not a signatory to the @entity46 , a treaty which provides a blueprint for safe international adoptions			1
many of the children adopted from @entity1 are given a better shot at life overseas - certainly in material terms -- but the speed and ease of the process has many observers worried			1
@entity59 worked at the @entity60 in @entity61 , @entity1 , for two years processing adoption visas			1
she is now the @entity1 national director of the @entity63 , an ngo promoting child rights and welfare			1
she says that many birth parents in @entity1 do n't fully understand what adoption actually means and that there is no word for ' adoption ' in the local @entity72 language			1
" i can say that about 60 % of the birth parents that i spoke to did n't understand adoption , " said @entity59			0
many birth parents do not understand that adoption is permanent			0
they believe they may get their children back later			2
these misconceptions are part of the problem , but not the only problem			0
the rise in @entity1 adoptions over the past few years has created a growing number of orphanages and adoption agencies to meet the demand			1
" when i first started processing visas at the embassy ... there were probably between seven and 10 orphanages that were putting children up for adoption			2
and the numbers grew , and they grew , and they grew			0
by the time i finished , and this was two years later , we had a count , and we were dealing with about 100 orphanages			0
the explosive growth of the adoption industry in @entity1 has fueled fears that children are being exploited for profit and that the best interests of the child is not paramount			1
" orphan creation does happen a lot in @entity1 , and this is done by adoption facilitators who will go and scout the slums , find vulnerable families and talk them into giving up their children , " said @entity59			1
in the 12 years from 1999 - 2010 there were just 311 adoptions from @entity1 to the @entity34 in 2011 alone -- the last year for which @entity115 numbers are available -- 207 children were adopted to the @entity34 from @entity1			1
@entity117 , age about 4 and @entity119 , about a year older , have found a loving family in the @entity34 but their early life was typical of @entity1 's estimated 2.4 million orphans			1
both boys were found abandoned in different places in @entity61 , both were left in conspicuous places and both were found by police officers			0
now @entity117 and @entity119 have a new life in the @entity34 , both are in school and having loving new parents			2
in 2008 , they were adopted by @entity134 and @entity135 of @entity136 through the @entity137 , one of the respected , religiously - affiliated orphanages			0
" there is always a tragedy at the beginning of a story that makes adoption a necessary step , " said @entity134			0
as their children grew up and left home , the @entity146 saw an opportunity to provide a stable home for children who would otherwise grow up in poverty			2
@entity153 reveals secrets of ' closed ' adoptions , report says the @entity146 became interested in international adoption after traveling to @entity1 with a church group			1
" i love that in our faith , adoption is part of the story -- that @entity164 was adopted and there was @entity166 in the @entity167 that was adopted and baby jesus			0
@entity170 was not his birth father			0
@entity172 , director of the @entity173 , understands the fears concerning the exploitation of children , but says that given the options for @entity1 children , in many cases adoption is the best solution			1
" i do n't think it 's right to say the @entity183 is the way to save @entity1 at all			1
i do n't think that 's the answer			0
but i think if there 's people in the @entity183 that can give these children a family when no one else can , i do think it 's more important , " said @entity172			2
but @entity194 , assistant commissioner of @entity195 for the @entity1 government , feels that @entity1 children should stay in @entity1			1
" it 's not right what they are doing			0
i know for them they get something out of it , but it 's also wrong to defraud parents and @entity1 of their children , " he said			1
@entity194 's fear is that by leaving @entity1 , many of these orphans will lose sight of their cultural identity			2
he also believes that regardless of the circumstances , many of these children would be better off with their birth parents			2
" that is the biggest thing that ever happens to a child			0
if the child remains with the family , they are able to grow up with them , " said @entity194			0
he added : " know they feel what is done in @entity34 and what is proper in @entity34 is a better life			0
but you could provide that better life to the child here , within the family ... you can change the life of that child within the family here , if you support them			0
" @entity117 and @entity119 ' adopted father , @entity135 , understands that his sons will lose some of their cultural heritage by growing up in the @entity34 , but he also sees the advantages			0
" it 's better that @entity1 orphans stay in @entity1 as much as possible but perhaps by us bringing two boys home or other people bringing @entity1 children back internationally , we can raise awareness to say , there is a need			1
" @entity245 , @entity246 , @entity247 of @entity248 produced " @entity249 " for @entity0			0
the film was made possible with funding from @entity252 .			0
