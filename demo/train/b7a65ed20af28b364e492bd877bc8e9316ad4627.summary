i scratched , spat , sucked on sunflower seeds , adjusted my cup ( coffee ) , wiped dirt from my palms onto my pants , tried to do what a ballplayer would do			1
i dug in , waggled my pen , stared at my @entity13 ballot like i 'd like to kill it			1
do i vote for him ? no , he cheated and got caught			1
do i vote for him ? i do n't know ...			1
he was just suspected of cheating			1
how about @entity15 ? no , he did n't get enough hits			1
but what about @entity15 ? he got a whole lot of hits , but was he as good as @entity15 ? this guy 's on the ballot for the first time			1
whereas that guy 's on it for the 15th and last time			1
this guy 's a jackass , a jerk			1
oh , man , though , could he hit			1
this guy 's a pleasure , a prince			1
but he sure could n't hit like that guy			2
and , whoa , that guy could pitch			2
so could this guy , but sure was n't that guy			2
i even stuck a @entity41 forever stamp on the envelope , although the postage was already on it			2
who would make it ? @entity46 , yes or no ? @entity47 , yes or no ? @entity48 ? @entity49 ? @entity50 ? @entity51 ? @entity52 ? maybe none ? none ? ? ? yes , i kept hearing as the december 31 vote deadline passed , very possibly not a one			1
wednesday , the news came			2
whatever you want to call it			2
yes , the answer was no. no to all			2
no to the man with 762 home runs			2
no to the pitcher who won 354 games			2
no to the hitter who got 3,060 hits			2
@entity69 ( 762 homers , most ever ) struck out			2
eight other guys on the ballot got more votes than he did			1
@entity76 ( 354 wins ) got lit up			1
three other pitchers got more votes than he did			2
@entity50 , ( 3,060 hits ) came closest			2
he got 388 , fell a mere 39 votes shy of a date in @entity85 , @entity86 , with a nice , bronzed bust and plaque			2
it was like he won all the electoral votes he needed except @entity91 and @entity92			2
he gave it a great shot			2
i could try to justify it			0
i could try to explain it			0
everybody has a right to be wrong			0
a total of 569 ballots were cast			0
five were turned in blank			0
i guess those voters have their reasons , bizarre as they are			0
a total of 37 names were on the ballot			1
i do n't know why			0
i ca n't tell you why one of those 569 voters gave a yes to @entity114 , a pitcher who won 148 games			0
i have no problem with @entity114 , but if he is a @entity117 , i am the husband of the @entity118			0
will i reveal my own vote ? no , i wo n't			0
not even whether i voted for @entity47 and @entity46 ? ok , dammit , i did			1
baseball writers balk at @entity121 of ' 13 i am not necessarily proud of it			1
i was not 100 % sure which way to go			0
i crunched the numbers on a number of the candidates , tried to weigh their qualifications , make up my mind if a guy was a hall of famer or merely wonderful			0
no such crunch was necessary for @entity47 or @entity46			1
i generally know a @entity117 when i see one , and whenever i saw those two guys , i saw two			0
but each had an asterisk			0
* * not a real asterisk			0
a make - believe asterisk			0
or more of a question mark , i guess			0
cheater ? @entity143 ? liar ? fraud ? neither of them , in my opinion , were proven beyond a shadow of a doubt to have broken baseball 's laws and rules			1
we can do the " you know and i know they did " thing all day long , but neither @entity46 nor @entity47 was ever banned , suspended or disciplined by @entity158 for being a steroids cheat			1
others got caught red - handed			0
banished from the field for a specified period the way @entity13 candidate @entity161 was and the way future @entity13 candidate @entity164 was			1
i ca n't look the same way at the accused the way i do at the convicted			0
i know , or know of , a lot of my brother and sister voters			0
i know they know baseball , love it , put a lot of thought into it			1
here is a partial list of @entity179 members who publicly acknowledged that they did cast votes for @entity76 and @entity69 : @entity181 , @entity182 , @entity183 , @entity184 , @entity185 , @entity186 , @entity187 , @entity188 , @entity189 , @entity190 , @entity191 , @entity192 , @entity193 , @entity194 , @entity195 , @entity196 , @entity197 , @entity198 , @entity199 , @entity200 , @entity201 , @entity202 , @entity203 , @entity204 , @entity205 , @entity206			0
now here is a partial list of @entity179 voters who said no to @entity47 and @entity69 : @entity210 , @entity211 , @entity212 , @entity213 , @entity214 , @entity215 , @entity216 , @entity217 , @entity218 , @entity219 , @entity220 , @entity221 , @entity222 , @entity223 , @entity224 , @entity225 , @entity226 , @entity227 , @entity228 , @entity229 , @entity230 , @entity231 , @entity232 , @entity233 , @entity234 , @entity235 , @entity236			1
they ca n't all be wrong			0
i have been maintaining since i began voting in the late 1980s that there are three kinds of professional baseball players -- the good , the great and the immortal			1
you can not play baseball for a living without being good			1
you can become great , or you can even become one of the greatest of all time			0
@entity46 and @entity47 are among the greatest of all time , without a doubt			1
but they have extenuating circumstances			0
@entity50 never seemed a mortal lock to be an immortal the way @entity46 and @entity47 do , but i can not tell you in a million years why 181 voters did not put a check mark by his name			1
) nor do i have a clue where the @entity13 goes from here			1
it took @entity258 and @entity259 a ridiculous number of tries to become @entity117 , but they made it			0
it took 15 ballot failures and a couple of post-election rejections before @entity268 made it , but he made it			1
posthumously , but he made it			0
i hear tv and radio announcers call a player " a surefire @entity117 " and i have no idea what universe they reside in that permits their mouths to form these words			0
there is no such thing as a surefire @entity117 any more			0
@entity282 will be on the ballot next year			1
if either of them fails , i will eat my cap			0
i will never , ever , ever refer to either as " a surefire @entity117 , " however , because that ship has sailed			0
the voters have spoken , as politicians have put it			0
i know there are millions of you who hate the way it came out			0
baseball is not supposed to be a game in which nobody wins			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity302 .			1

not one of the 37 players on the 2013 ballot will be *inducted* into the @entity13
@entity302 : " you can not play baseball for a living without being good "
@entity302 says there is no proof @entity46 and @entity47 broke baseball 's rules
@entity302 : " baseball is not supposed to be a game in which nobody wins "
