@entity0 -- the tragic case of the 23 - year old woman who was brutally attacked , raped and left for dead by six men in @entity0 on december 16 has highlighted the unacceptable reality millions of women in @entity7 are facing			1
violence against women is endemic -- more than 220,000 cases of violent crimes against women were reported in 2011 according to official statistics from the @entity7 government , with the actual number likely to be much higher			2
if there has been a silver lining to this horrendous case , it has been the enormous outcry from @entity7 society			0
what started as student - led protests in @entity0 has grown to encompass @entity7 from all walks of life and from the whole political spectrum			1
tens of thousands have taken to the streets with the clear message that something has to change , and that women should no longer have to live in fear			0

five of the six suspects were formally charged in @entity0 on thursday , with the authorities investigating whether the sixth suspect is under 18 and a juvenile			0
the five are expected to be charged with several offences including murder , which is punishable by death under @entity7 law			1

but imposing the death penalty would just perpetuate the cycle of violence			1
@entity67 opposes the death penalty in all circumstances , regardless of the circumstances or the nature of the crime			1
it is the ultimate cruel and inhuman punishment , and a violation of a fundamental human right -- the right to life			0
there is no evidence to suggest that the threat of execution works as a special deterrent			0
this is reflected in a clear global trend moving towards the abolition of the death penalty			1
today , 140 countries in the world have abolished executions in law or practice			0

@entity97 's killing meant @entity7 took a significant step backwards and joined the minority of countries in the world that are still executing			0
with hundreds of prisoners still on death row in @entity7 , this is a key moment for the country and its use of the death penalty			1
the @entity7 authorities must not let the @entity97 , execution and the outrage around the @entity0 rape trigger a resumption of executions on a larger scale			1
what @entity7 needs now is not revenge , but to address the many underlying issues that are perpetuating endemic violence against women			2
the laws and the justice system must be reformed , and the definition of rape , which is currently far from adequate , should be amended			0

imposing the death penalty for sexual assault cases would likely only worsen this situation , as judges would hesitate to give such an extreme sentence , and the legal process would become even lengthier and more complicated			2
the @entity7 police force has to be better trained to deal with survivors of sexual violence , and there is a need to develop support systems for survivors			2
many women are reluctant to report crimes , fearing humiliation and degrading treatment by the police , or the social stigma that comes from society at large			0
there are also still serious systematic failures in the @entity7 justice system that raise questions about its efficiency			0
to even begin to talk about a method of punishment until these issues have been addressed is to seriously jump the gun			0
this sentiment has been echoed by many , including @entity168 human rights chief @entity167 , who has called for legal reform while cautioning against the use of the death penalty			2
after a year in which both @entity172 and @entity173 resumed executions after relatively long moratoriums , @entity7 now has an opportunity to show real leadership on a key human rights issue in the region			0
there is no question that the country 's women deserve much better legal protection , but the death penalty is not the answer			2
