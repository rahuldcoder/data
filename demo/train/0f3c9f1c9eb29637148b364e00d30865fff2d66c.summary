-- on @entity3 's 158th birthday , it was the effort to build a museum in the influential scientist 's honor that got the gift			1
@entity8 , the magnate and inventor behind electric - car company @entity10 , has pledged $ 1 million to the @entity11 in @entity12 , @entity13 , on the site of @entity15 , @entity3 's only remaining laboratory			1
and it 's all due , at least in large part , to an appeal from a webcomic creator			0
@entity21 , whose comic and website the @entity22 draws millions of readers each month , wrote thursday that he had spoken to @entity8 and confirmed the pledge			1
" so , i had a call with @entity8 earlier this week ... " @entity30 wrote on his site			0
he said @entity8 , who named his car company as a tribute to the inventor , told him two things during the phone call : that he would install a @entity3 charging station in the museum 's parking lot and that he 'll donate the million to the effort to fully restore and operate it			1
@entity42 , president of the @entity11 , announced the pledge at a birthday party at the center on thursday			2
" ( @entity8 ) has challenged us at the center to use our resources wisely , find additional resources , and reach our goal of creating this museum , " she said			0
" we are excited and extremely grateful for mr. @entity8 's generous gift to @entity11 , and also to @entity21 for arranging the opportunity			2
" the @entity11 had confirmed the news on its @entity55 feed earlier			0
" @entity8 : from the deepest wells of my geeky little heart : thank you , " @entity30 wrote			0
" this is amazing news			0
and it 's @entity3 's 158th birthday			2
" in one of his comics , @entity30 compared @entity3 favorably to his better - known contemporary -- and rival -- @entity66			2
then , in 2012 , he joined forces with an effort to buy @entity15 and turn it into a @entity3 museum			1
a fundraiser he started on @entity76 , cheekily named " let 's build a g * * damn @entity73 , " raised a whopping $ 1.3 million , more than enough to buy the property			1
since then , the foundation has been raising the roughly $ 8 million needed to restore the site and build the museum itself			1
that 's why this year , in a comic reviewing his new @entity83 , @entity30 devoted part of it to calling on @entity8 to help out			0
though @entity10 is named in honor of the scientist , whose work included early electrical experiments , the @entity3 family is in no way involved with the company			1
within hours of the comic being posted , @entity8 , who had donated $ 2,500 to the initial effort , sent @entity30 a simple message on @entity55 : " i would be happy to help			0
" a representative for @entity10 also confirmed the gift to @entity0 on thursday			1
born in 1856 , @entity3 was a @entity98 - @entity97 engineer and inventor who helped pioneer the use of electricity , among other achievements			1
at @entity15 , @entity3 worked on developing wireless communications , more than 100 years before anyone would hold a smartphone , and methods for delivering clean , free energy			2
but his work lost much of its financial backing after inventor @entity110 sent radio signals across the @entity112 , and the lab site was lost in 1915			2
@entity3 died at age 86 in 1943 , in debt and living in a @entity13 hotel			0
his legacy and work languished in relative obscurity for decades thereafter			0
but in recent years , people in the science community have begun championing him as the true innovator of his age , saying that if his work had been properly funded , it may have led to dramatic changes in the way utilities like phone and electric service are delivered today .			0

the founder of @entity10 is giving $ 1 million to a museum for its *namesake*
*volunteers* raised money to save the last remaining lab of inventor @entity3
they need several million more , though , to restore it and build a museum
