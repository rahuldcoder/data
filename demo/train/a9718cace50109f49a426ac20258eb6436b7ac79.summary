-- i suppose we like to predict the future because uncertainty makes us uncomfortable			1
or maybe we just like the game of analysis			1
before a baseball season starts , for example , you 'll find experts predicting who will win the pennant races and the @entity13			1
indeed , it 's not even a month after the @entity15 and you can find confident assurances of who will be in the big game next year			1
politics is no different , of course , although the prediction business has more important consequences			1
i think we -- and by " we " i mean all of us in the news and commentary business -- have to be careful to distinguish between analysis and prediction			1
true , the predictive powers of polls has improved since @entity35 " defeated " @entity36 in 1948 , but as any meteorologist will tell you , the farther away the weather system , the more difficult it is to predict its behavior on a given day			1
analysis , on the other hand , can give us a better understanding of issues , effects of policies , and the all - important " mood of the electorate , " even though those can change as quickly as the path of a tornado			1
what brings all this to mind is a recent article by @entity53 for the online @entity54 , " @entity55 the @entity56 has a @entity57 in the @entity58			1
" the article argues that , " for all their internal divisions and long - term worries as a party , political scientists and historical trends give republicans a clear advantage in the upcoming 2014 congressional elections			1
" i 'm not refuting the four reasons ( good thing they 're not @entity70 )			1
i just question if they are so predictively absolute			1
i see other factors at play			1
the first factor @entity53 writes about is " the six - year curse for presidents			1
" he notes , " since the ratification of @entity79 term limits , five of the six two - term presidents have lost seats after re-election			1
" what intrigues me is the exception : @entity86 in 1998 , because of a strong economy and voter backlash against the @entity56 - led impeachment			1
@entity90 that year fought back hard by recruiting good quality candidates who gained the trust of the people			1
speaking of president @entity86 , he 's campaigning for @entity95 in @entity96			2
despite all the recent attacks , the @entity98 ' popularity remains sky high across the country , including in the @entity102			2
@entity90 candidates are hopeful they will be able to campaign for them across the country			2
so that 's x-factor one			2
midterm elections are only partly a referendum on the president			2
with the @entity98 campaigning , the equation changes			2
the second reason is " @entity90 voters do n't turn out in midterms			2
" the historical trend shows that age is a factor : " older voters disproportionately turn out in midterms , and they 've moved to the @entity56 in recent decades , " argues @entity53			2
and yet , the @entity56 attempts at voter suppression may well backfire			2
perhaps the @entity56 's current campaign to block attempts to extend unemployment insurance , block a raise in the minimum wage and take away health care will motivate some voters to turn out because it 's in their self interest			2
we all know that an angry electorate is a voting electorate			1
i expect young people and minorities to surprise the pundits			0
i expect women to organize and vote in surprising numbers			0
a threatened electorate is also a voting electorate			1
voter turnout comes down to organizing , educating , activating			0
from what i 've seen in my travels around the country , there 's a grass - roots groundswell that may very well resemble the 1998 " backlash			0
" the third factor @entity53 cites is that " republicans have a mathematical advantage in the @entity153			0
" they need to pick up a net of six seats			0
democrats are defending 21 seats , many in conservative states such as @entity160 , @entity161 and @entity162			0
here 's the thing : in the 12 states that @entity165 won that also had a @entity153 race , @entity90 won five of them : @entity169 , @entity170 , @entity171 , @entity172 and @entity173			0
these states are at least as conservative as the @entity102 states above			0
generally , @entity153 races are not a referendum on the president or on any one issue , but a choice between the two candidates on the ballot			0
thus @entity185 @entity184 remains strong in @entity162 , while in @entity96 , @entity56 @entity183 , the minority leader , is in trouble			0
as @entity188 observed , " all politics is local			1
" in each competitive @entity153 race there 's a clear contrast between a @entity90 candidate -- focused on creating opportunity for the middle class and willing to disagree with the party leadership -- and a @entity56 candidate beholden to the tea party , the @entity200 brothers and a small group of right - wing billionaires who support an agenda that will not enable the middle class or working families to prosper			0
while some @entity90 senators and a handful of congressional candidates may disagree with the president on specific economic priorities for their state , they all support his efforts to provide better wages for workers , fairness for women in the workplace and affordable opportunities to go to college and prepare for high - skilled jobs			0
despite an influx of negative ads underwritten by the @entity200 brothers and their allies , @entity90 must find a way to stay on message and reach people where they live , work , eat and pray			0
finally , @entity232 mentions that " the @entity79 map is skewed toward the @entity56			0
" there 's no disputing this , just as there 's no disputing the fact that @entity56 obstructionism in the @entity79 has prevented the country from moving forward			0
how much did @entity56 gerrymandering after 2010 lockjaw the @entity79 ? political scientists may debate that , but @entity79 majorities do change , and sometimes unexpectedly			0
my point is that the " season " has n't started			0
we can analyze strengths and weaknesses , but let 's see how the teams play over the long haul , starting now with the upcoming primary elections			0
once the primary season has ended , we can start keeping score			0
until then , the sideshow is simply a distraction			0
join us on @entity260 / @entity259			0
