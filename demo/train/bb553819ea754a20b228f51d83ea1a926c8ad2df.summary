-- even before the smoke had cleared from a series of bombings in the @entity7 capital of @entity8 tuesday , @entity2 defense minister @entity1 blamed @entity9 for the incident , as well as the attacks against @entity2 diplomats in @entity13 and @entity14 two days ago			1
" the attempted terror attack in @entity7 proves once again that @entity9 and its proxies continue to operate in the ways of terror and the latest attacks are an example of that , " he said			2
@entity2 prime minister @entity22 agreed			0
" in recent months , we have witnessed several attempts to attack @entity2 citizens and @entity26 in several countries , including @entity28 , @entity7 and others			1
@entity9 and its proxy , @entity31 , were behind all of these attempted attacks			0
" was the government of @entity9 behind the bomb assembly operation in @entity8 ? most likely , yes			1
was it part of a larger global effort to target @entity2 diplomats in retaliation for the assassination of @entity9 nuclear scientists in @entity9 ? yes , again			1
but the three men allegedly responsible for the @entity8 bombings can hardly be considered professional , hard - core @entity31 terrorists			2
the suspects were not involved in a sophisticated , state - financed terrorist attack			1
the bombs were poorly made and constructed			0
the chaotic departure from the area and the lack of operational security in entering and moving about since they entered the country indicate a relatively amateurish operation with little advance planning for contingencies			1
so , what is the @entity9 connection ? it is possible that @entity9 is seeking to modulate its retaliation for the murder of a number of its scientists over the past two years			1
for all its bluster , @entity9 leaders are well aware that trigger - happy @entity2 is itching for a showdown over the evolving @entity9 nuclear weapons program			1
@entity9 with an atomic weapon has been an @entity2 " red - line " for several decades			2
and @entity9 leaders , poised astride an economy reeling under yet another round of economic sanctions , can ill afford a destabilizing war with @entity2 ( and the @entity75 ) , particularly one they would likely lose quickly and decisively			2
@entity2 , @entity9 trade accusations but outsourcing terrorist attacks on @entity2 targets to semi-incompetent subcontractors gives @entity9 neither plausible deniability nor direct control to dial - down the scope of retaliation to avoid handing the @entity2 a chance to respond strategically			1
it is more probable that @entity9 intelligence has leveraged " @entity89 " contacts in several countries to plan and carry out attacks against @entity2 diplomats			1
while some support or funds might be available , the @entity9 government would strive to keep its distance from farm - league terrorists putting together bombs in portable radios			0
the @entity8 suspects were carrying @entity9 passports -- not false documents			1
their movements were crude , embarrassingly overt and ended in a debacle of incompetence and bad luck			0
unfortunately , @entity7 police investigations are not likely to shed light on the @entity9 connection			0
senior security officials claimed the explosions were not acts of terrorism because the bombs involved could not cause " large - scale destruction			0
" always sensitive to tarnishing @entity7 's lucrative tourism sector , @entity7 officials are likely to continue to downplay the implications of tuesday 's explosions and seek to move the story off the media radar			0
on january 12 , after a controversial @entity75 @entity122 terrorist alert was issued , @entity7 officials arrested @entity123 , after finding " initial chemical materials that could produce bombs " in an area just outside @entity8			0
police said @entity123 , who also holds a @entity129 passport , led them to the location			0
the authorities are accusing @entity123 of trying to attack spots in @entity8 that are popular with @entity134 tourists and say he is believed to belong to @entity31 , the @entity135 group active in @entity136 that the @entity75 views as a terrorist organization			2
@entity7 's second terrorism wake - up call rang out tuesday afternoon in @entity8			2
whether @entity7 officials respond or simply hit the snooze button and continue to believe " it could never happen here , " remains to be seen			0
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity145			0

@entity145 : @entity8 suspects not involved in a sophisticated , state - financed terrorist attack
@entity145 : attack was amateurish operation with little advance planning for contingencies
@entity145 : it 's possible @entity9 is seeking to modulate its retaliation for murder of its scientists
@entity145 : @entity9 may have leveraged " @entity89 " contacts to attack @entity2 diplomats
