-- @entity1 may not be the force it once was -- but it still had too much for @entity3			1
city , which has now exited both the @entity5 and @entity6 in the past week , was always going to find life difficult after losing the first leg of its @entity6 last - 16 tie			1
trailing by two goals and with the knowledge that no club has ever managed to progress after suffering a 2 - 0 defeat at home in the first leg of the competition , @entity4 at least gave it a real go in a pulsating contest at the @entity20			1
in the end , despite plenty of courage and endeavor , goals from @entity22 and @entity23 decided this tie as @entity1 gained a 2 - 1 win to progress 4 - 1 on aggregate			1
@entity31 had briefly leveled the game with a minute of normal time remaining before @entity23 struck -- and @entity4 finished the game with 10 - men after @entity35 was sent off			2
" we 've got nothing left in the tank , we gave everything , " @entity31 told @entity36			2
" we could have scored earlier which would have changed the game			0
" you have to take your half chances against the best teams			0
over the course of the two games there was not much between the sides			0
@entity22 is incredible player but outside of that it was even			1
" only the winners get remembered but it 's only our third season in the @entity6			1
" the way we have played means we should fear nobody next season and our time will come			0
" much had been made of @entity1 's supposed fragility under @entity60 and its recent defeats by @entity62 and @entity63			1
@entity60 , who replaced @entity64 at the start of the season , has come under increasing pressure with his team four points off league leader @entity70			0
but here , his team had too much for @entity4 , even if some doubts remain about its ability to challenge the likes of @entity76 and @entity63 for the trophy			0
it was @entity4 which started the better of the two but the visitor soon began to ride its luck as @entity1 grew frustrated at the decisions of the officials			1
with manager @entity83 sat in the stands after being handed a touchline ban following his disparaging remarks about @entity88 referee @entity87 , who presided over the first leg , @entity4 was left in the hands of assistant @entity91			0
not that there was much @entity93 could do as @entity1 began to turn the screw			1
first , the home side felt it should have been awarded a penalty when @entity22 went down under the challenge of @entity98 but referee @entity99 waved away the appeals			1
if that decision was marginal , what followed was hugely fortunate as the assistant referee deprived @entity1 of what would have been a perfectly legitimate goal			1
@entity22 found @entity106 and when the midfield maestro slipped in @entity108 , the full - back crossed for @entity110 to tap the ball into the empty net			1
unfortunately for @entity1 , the offside flag had been raised , despite @entity114 clearly being in an onside position			1
having survived the early scare , @entity4 slowly found their feet and should have taken the lead four minutes before the interval			0
@entity120 , formerly of @entity1 , picked out @entity121 and when the @entity123 's sublime flick found @entity124 , the @entity4 midfielder could only shoot straight at @entity126			1
the second half provided more enthralling action with @entity22 coming within inches of breaking the deadlock after jinking his way into the penalty area before smashing an effort against the post			2
at the other end , @entity137 , on as a halftime substitute for the injured @entity136 , sent a looping header towards goal which was brilliantly clawed away by @entity126 with the ball seemingly destined for the corner			0
@entity35 then fired wide as @entity4 threatened to plunder the goal that their play had deserved			0
as @entity4 pushed forward in search of that elusive opener , @entity1 began to make the most of the space left behind			2
and it came as little surprise when @entity22 finally broke through , clipping the ball past @entity152 to score his 67th @entity6 goal			1
there was still more drama to come with a little over 12 minutes remaining when @entity137 appeared to be blatantly fouled inside the penalty area by @entity157 -- but referee @entity99 disagreed			0
such was @entity4 's anger that @entity35 was shown a second yellow card and promptly dismissed for voicing his frustration			0
@entity4 did net an equalizer through @entity164 with a minute of normal time remaining to salvage some pride			0
but @entity1 refused to be denied and @entity166 netted a late winner , firing home from @entity170 's pass to secure victory			2
" it was a very tight game against a world class team , " @entity1 's @entity172 told @entity36			2
" it was a great result to win 2 - 0 over there and today it was tough			1
" we created a lot of chances , we had a goal which was onside ruled out and could have had a penalty			0
" we go home happy			0
the last couple of games have not made us happy , we had some negative results but we have to be proud of today 's result			0
" everything is good at the club			0
we are in the final of the cup , we are four points behind in the league and in the last eight of the @entity6			2
a lot of teams would swap			0
" @entity22 , who scored his 28th goal of the season , believes this result proves @entity1 is on the way back to finding its best form			1
@entity1 , which sits third in @entity202 , faces @entity203 this weekend before traveling to @entity70 for ' @entity204 ' on march 23			2
" i think tonight we got back to being the @entity1 that we all want to see and we were able to beat a very tough opponent , " he told @entity205			2
" i do n't know if the criticism ( in the media after the @entity202 defeat to @entity63 ) was over the top			0
we are the first to criticize ourselves and we did n't play the way we should have done there			0
" we do n't let the criticism affect us and we just focus on ourselves and try to turn things around and that 's what we did tonight , i think			0
" in the night 's other game , @entity216 secured its place in the last eight with a 2 - 1 win over @entity221 to secure a 6 - 1 aggregate victory			1
after @entity223 had given the @entity225 side a surprise lead , @entity216 hit back through @entity227 , who headed home from close range			2
@entity230 than missed a penalty for @entity221 before @entity232 sealed the win for the @entity235 champion			1
@entity221 ended the contest with 10 - men after @entity238 was shown a second yellow card for diving .			1

@entity1 books its place in the *quarterfinals* of @entity6
@entity22 on target in 2 - 1 win over @entity3
@entity216 qualifies for last - eight
@entity235 champion defeated @entity221
