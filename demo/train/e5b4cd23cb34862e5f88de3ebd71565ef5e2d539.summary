-- some of the biggest names in tennis have faltered at @entity3 , but @entity4 showed his grit to beat @entity6 after being comprehensively outplayed in the first set			1
@entity4 will now have one eye on the crystal trophy as rivals @entity10 and @entity12 crashed out against lowly opponents			1
the world @entity14 -- twice the winner at @entity3 in 2008 and 2011 -- booked his place in the quarterfinals of the masters 1000 tournament with a 1 - 6 6 - 2 6 - 3 victory in @entity21 on wednesday			1
@entity6 , seeded 24th , surged ahead to a 5 - 0 lead on his way to winning the first set , but @entity4 claims not to have been fazed			1
" i was composed and mentally calm , regardless of the score line , " he told reporters			0
" i just accepted the fact that he came out of the blocks better than i did			0
" the match ended as a sweeping victory for the @entity31 , who did not face a break point while taking the remaining sets			0
@entity4 finds himself the top - ranked player remaining at the first @entity36 masters tournament of the year after the shock exit of world no. 1 @entity38 in the third round and other high - seeded contenders in round four			1
@entity42 is now the only other player from the top 10 remaining in the tournament			2
he reached the last eight with a 6 - 4 6 - 4 victory over @entity47 veteran @entity46 , but was robbed of the enticing prospect of an all - @entity50 quarterfinal			1
the stage had been set for a clash between third - seeded @entity12 -- still racing from january 's @entity54 victory undefeated in 2014 before the match -- and former world no. 1			1
but 32 - year - old @entity42 will now meet @entity57 in the last eight after the @entity59 defeated @entity12 in three sets ( 7 - 6 ( 7/1 ) 4 - 6 6 - 1 )			1
at the end of a 13 - match winning streak this year , the 28 - year - old @entity50 was reflective : " i do n't feel the pressure of losing a match , because i knew it 's going to happen , " @entity12 told reporters			1
" i 'm not going to keep winning every tournament			0
" @entity12 was not alone in faltering in the round of 16			2
@entity10 was left to ponder his form after once again failing to reach the latter stages of the tournament			2
the world @entity71 is yet to reach a final since having back surgery in september , and his limp performance against 23 - year - old @entity76 left him bemused			0
" i 'll need to have a think about it and have a look at what happened , " @entity10 told reporters after the 4 - 6 7 - 5 6 - 3 defeat			2
" it 's going to come down to confidence			0
there 's no other explanation for missing those shots			0
" @entity76 , the 10th seed , will now face @entity38 's conqueror @entity89			0
order was restored in the women 's tournament , where second - seeded @entity93 and sixth - seeded @entity94 both recorded wins			1
@entity96 was first to book a place in the semis of the @entity100 singles , strolling to a 6 - 2 6 - 2 victory over unseeded @entity103 @entity102			0
@entity104 joined her later in the afternoon			0
she completed a three - set victory over @entity31 's @entity106 ( 7 - 5 2 - 6 6 - 4 ) to set up a rematch of last month 's semi-final in @entity109			0
after that defeat , @entity93 will be hoping for a different result on friday when the two will meet for a shot at the final .			2

@entity4 booked his place in the quarter finals at @entity3
@entity10 and @entity12 lose against lower seeded opponents
@entity42 joins @entity4 with easy win over @entity47 's @entity46
