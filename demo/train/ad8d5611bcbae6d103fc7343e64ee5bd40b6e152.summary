@entity6 : @entity7 soldiered into the top spot over @entity9 weekend , piling up $ 41.2 million over three days and bringing the four - day cume to $ 51.7 million			1
@entity7 did n't quite set the record for @entity9 weekend — those bragging rights belong to 2010 ′ s @entity13 ( $ 61.2 million ) — and it did n't quite match the opening of @entity6 : rise of the @entity16 's $ 54.7 million bow in 2009			1
but @entity17 and @entity19 's starpower helped keep the attrition from the poorly received @entity16 to a minimum			0

@entity39 's name still means money , even if precedes the full title temptation : @entity43			1
it 's the ninth @entity39 film to debut over $ 20 million ; the only other directors to have reached that distinction are @entity59 and @entity60			1
despite its twilight connections , no one had overly high hopes for the alien invasion romance the host , based on the novel by @entity68			0
neither the novel nor the three leads — @entity71 , @entity72 , and @entity73 — were nearly as squeal inducing to the largely female audiences that made twilight popular			0
weighed down by laughably bad reviews and unappealing trailers , the host disappointed with $ 11 million in sixth place			1
@entity6 : retaliation -- $ 41.2 million 2			1
the @entity36 -- $ 26.5 million 3			2
