@entity0 -- president @entity2 is crafting his own laws of political physics these days , insisting that inaction by a divided @entity6 requires @entity8 action in order to get something done			1
a campaign labeled " we ca n't wait " pushes unilateral directives and programs from the @entity8 as the only way to push ahead on the president 's agenda when a do - nothing @entity6 fails to act			1
there is a lack of action , " @entity8 press secretary @entity19 explained to reporters this week when asked about a series of executive orders and actions the president has taken or is planning			1
" so there is a need to move , because we can move			0
" @entity31 reject the premise of the @entity8 position , arguing that @entity2 chooses to blame @entity6 for inaction instead of working with legislators from both parties on bills that can pass			1
house speaker @entity38 , speaking on the @entity39 show last week , described as laughable the prospect that @entity2 would use executive orders to bypass @entity6 on substantive issues			1
at the same time , though , the @entity43 @entity31 said he would keep close watch to make sure nothing unconstitutional happens			1
to @entity46 , a @entity47 political science professor who wrote a book on executive orders , @entity2 is carrying on a consistent tradition of his predecessors in trying to expand the power of the presidency as much as possible			1
" it 's incremental , " @entity46 said			0
" each president kind of adds to the power that the presidency has			2
" in @entity2 's case , " we pretty much are seeing that behind the scenes he 's centralizing power , " @entity46 continued			2
" he 's not really different than anyone else			0
" for @entity2 , the strategy of executive orders serves a dual purpose by moving forward on parts of his agenda despite @entity31 opposition while projecting an image of decisive action in the face of political inaction			1
" @entity6 has been trying since february to do something about this , " @entity2 said monday in announcing an executive order that directs the @entity75 to increase efforts to reduce shortages of some prescription drugs			1
" it has not yet been able to get it done			0
and it is the belief of this administration ... that we ca n't wait for action on @entity85 ; we 've got to go ahead and move forward			2
" his @entity31 foes call such rhetoric grandstanding , noting it leads to piecemeal steps instead of working with @entity6 to pass more substantive legislation acceptable to both parties			1
" i know he 's desperately interested in trying to blame anybody else , but he 's the president of the @entity95 , he set the agenda , he got everything he wanted			0
and it did n't work , " @entity99 @entity98 of @entity100 said last week			0
@entity2 rejects the @entity31 view , saying in his weekly address saturday that @entity31 foes now refuse to debate job - creation measures that congressional @entity31 have supported in the past			1
in addition , @entity31 counter-proposals to cut regulations and roll back health care and @entity111 reforms failed to address the immediate need to reduce unemployment , @entity2 argues			1
" meanwhile , they 're only scheduled to work three more weeks between now and the end of the year , " @entity2 said in the saturday address			0
" the truth is , we can no longer wait for @entity6 to do its job			2
the middle - class families who 've been struggling for years are tired of waiting			0
so where @entity6 wo n't act , i will			1
" @entity46 , however , said the presidential messaging of the " @entity126 " campaign amounts to what he called " political theater			0
" @entity2 is trying to " pass the ball " to congressional republicans " so that they have to hold economic problems in their hands during the election , " said @entity46 , whose 2006 book was titled " executive orders and the @entity138 : legislating from the @entity139			1
" almost three years into his term , @entity2 is on a similar pace in issuing executive orders issued as his recent predecessors such as @entity144 , @entity145 and @entity146			1
while some executive orders are routine or ceremonial in nature , presidents since @entity148 have used them more for major policy directives to sidestep the legislative or bureaucratic process , @entity46 said			1
" what they 're doing here is they 're using these tools to bypass the legislative process to make laws , " he said , adding that the @entity8 " through the president is taking the lead , saying this is what we want here			2
" the prescription drug executive order announced monday is designed to help reduce a growing number of prescription drug shortages while protecting patients from possible pharmaceutical industry price gouging			0
among other things , the order requires the @entity75 to increase its reporting of possible shortages of certain prescription drugs , while also speeding up regulatory reviews of new drug manufacturing sites , drug suppliers and manufacturing changes			0
the @entity180 will be tasked with examining whether specific drug shortages are tied to an intentional stockpiling of medications designed to raise prices			0
other new policies pushed by the @entity8 include steps to help families refinance homes that have lost value in the recession , programs to help war veterans get jobs , and reforms to student loan processing			2
when questioned by reporters tuesday , @entity19 conceded that legislation passed by @entity6 would be a more substantive step toward the kind of job - creation measures needed to help the struggling economic recovery			2
for example , @entity2 's proposed jobs bill " is filled with provisions that require legislative action , " @entity19 said			0
" he 's not pulling things out and making them law by fiat			0
i 'm sure he wishes he could			0
" @entity19 also has insisted that @entity2 " is acting well within his authority , well within his constitutional authority " by taking what he called administrative steps			0
according to @entity46 , other examples of unilateral executive steps include signing statements , proclamations , memorandums and directives			0
signing statements are documents from the president that challenge or reject specific provisions in bills passed by @entity6 , acting as a kind of line - item veto that can serve as legal reasoning in a possible court challenge , @entity46 said			1
proclamations are usually ceremonial in nature , he added , but presidents have been known to slip in policy statements or other substantive steps			0
if the language shifts from the generally flowery prose of a ceremonial proclamation , he said , look closely for a policy issue somewhere in the text			0
historically , executive orders are rarely overturned			1
to do so in @entity6 would require overcoming a likely presidential veto , an unlikely event in the current @entity245 - controlled @entity244			2
@entity46 noted that the @entity246 could exercise its judicial review authority to strike down an executive order as being unconstitutional			0
however , he said , research showed that @entity6 and the courts " have been quite passive in challenging executive orders			1
" " there is a lot of research that is needed on this subject , " he said , " but one of the theories about why this might be the case is that @entity6 and the courts are reluctant to engage in a separation - of - powers battle with the president			2

new : few legal challenges are made against executive orders
the @entity8 says if @entity6 , and especially @entity31 , wo n't act , we will
@entity31 reject the @entity8 campaign as grandstanding
