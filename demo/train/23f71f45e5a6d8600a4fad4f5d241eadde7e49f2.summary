editor 's note : @entity2 -- the larger , louder half of @entity4 -- is a magician , comedian , actor , author and producer			1
@entity11 and @entity12 both promise a government that will watch over us ... " i do n't like that , " says @entity2			1
( @entity15 ) -- everyone i talk to seems to think the president of the @entity19 right now is stupid			0
the @entity21 presidency is stupid speeches , stupid high gas prices , stupid bad economy , stupid war on terrorism , stupid war on drugs , stupid hurricane fixing , stupid global warming , stupid war -- stupid , stupid , stupid			0
they all seem to think we need to get a smarter guy in the @entity35 fast , and @entity21 is so stupid , that task should n't be too hard			1
i 'd like to say that i believe every president in @entity19 history , including the stupid one we have now , is smarter than me			1
my alma mater is @entity41 and @entity42 on @entity43 , so i 'm damning with faint praise , but i 'm stupider than this here stupid president			0
maybe i 'm less stupider than @entity21 than i 'm stupider than @entity46			0
but i 'm stupider than all the stupid in both of them put together			0
the idea , especially from the @entity50 that i know , is , we just get a smarter guy in the @entity35 , and all the problems will go away			1
we 'll have smart speeches , smart high gas prices , smart bad economy , smart war on terrorism , smart war on drugs , smart hurricanes , smart global warming , smart war in @entity64 -- smart , smart , smart			0
@entity11 is way smarter than @entity21 -- so way , way smarter than me			1
@entity11 is way more charismatic than me			1
he did his big speech for about 80,000 people ; i 'll do my show tonight in @entity69 for about 1,000 people			1
he 's more ambitious than @entity71 ; he 's going to be the next president of the @entity19 , and i could n't even get to week three of " @entity73			2
" @entity11 is a great leader			1
he can fire people up and get them to do what he wants			2
he does smart speeches that promise everyone everything they need and make us feel good about our country and how much greater our government could be			2
but i do n't think our next president being a great leader is a good thing			1
i 'm worried about someone smarter than @entity21 taking over that tremendous power			2
@entity88 and ambition increase my fear exponentially , and a great leader scares me to death			1
we need someone stupid enough to understand that the president of the @entity19 ca n't solve many problems without taking away freedom and therefore should n't try			0
the only reason @entity12 scares me a little less is because i think he 's a little less likely to win			1
they both promise a government that will watch over us , and i do n't like that			2
i do n't want anyone as president who promises to take care of me			0
i may be stupid , but i want a chance to try to be a grown - up and take care of my family			0
@entity109 means the freedom to be stupid , and that 's what i want			2
i do n't want anyone to feel my pain or tell me to ask what we can do for our country , or give us all money and take care of us			0
@entity119 at the @entity120 explains that the @entity121 wanted the president " to faithfully execute the laws , defend the country from attack and check @entity126 with the veto power whenever it exceeded its constitutional bounds			0
" that sounds like plenty to me			0
you got ta be smarter than me to do all that , but you do n't have to be as smart as @entity11 , and you sure do n't have to be a great leader			1
our first seven presidents averaged a bit more than three public speeches a year , and they did n't promise jobs for everyone , day care , dental exams and free stuff			0
it 's really hard to find someone who trusts @entity19 to take care of themselves and each other without government force			1
it 's hard to find someone running for president who would be content to be what @entity151 humbly called the " chief magistrate			2
" i think @entity154 and @entity155 mean it when they say they want much smaller government			1
but the government is already big enough , powerful enough and bipartisan enough ( and " bi " means exactly two and no more ) that @entity154 and / or @entity155 wo n't even be in the debates			1
people wo n't even hear someone suggesting that our president should do less and individual citizens should do more for themselves			2
the choice should n't be which lesser of two evils should have the enormous power of our modern presidents			0
the question should be , who would do less as president ? who would leave us alone ? if we could find a lazier , less charismatic , stupider person than me to be president , i 'd be all for it			0
but , it 's not going to be easy ; stupider than me is rare breed			0
so remember , the only way to waste your vote is to vote ! the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the writer .			0
