-- @entity3 's most ardent supporters in " real @entity4 " love to suggest that those of us who do n't buy into her shtick fail to grasp why they love her , citing her realness , plain - spokenness and whatever else they can conjure up			1
folks , nice try , but as a native @entity11 , i 've seen many politicians and wannabes over the years who had charm , wit , charisma and a twinkle in their eye			0
anyone who has listened to the best football coaches the @entity11 has to offer will tell you that they can persuade a mother and father to send their boy to hell to fetch a glass of ice water and bring him home a better man			0
they could teach a politician or two how to connect with average @entity4			0
you want a media darling politician with substance ? try the late gov. @entity35 , a woman who could cut you deep and beam ear - to - ear with her motherly smile			2
but unlike @entity3 , she had a host of strong ideas in her head that actually made sense and appealed to a cross-section of folks			1
former rep. @entity45 , who died this week , was a smooth - talking @entity11 who loved to party hard			0
but when it came to politics , he knew how to get things done			0
the media loved him because he could sit with you and enjoy a beer over barbecue , give them a hilarious quote or two , and explain foreign policy better than @entity55			2
why have n't i cottoned to @entity3 ? because she portrays herself as a straight - talking politician who wants to lead a movement in the " @entity59 " -- but is nothing more than a political celebrity willing to cash every check she can grab			1
what truly exposed her for me ? it was the ridiculous way she reacted in opposing ways last week to two political heavyweights who used the word " retard			1
" when it was reported that president @entity72 's chief of staff , @entity71 , told a group of liberals that they were " f --- -- g retards " for threatening to run ads against fellow @entity76 who were n't jumping on the health care reform bandwagon , @entity3 demanded his resignation			1
as the mother of a child with @entity84 , @entity3 has often used her bully pulpit to demand respect for the mentally challenged			1
it is an issue that is close to her heart , and she should be a fierce advocate for them			0
yet when one of her biggest supporters , conservative radio talk - show host @entity95 , also castigated liberals by calling them " retards , " @entity3 provided him cover , even trying to explain away his comments			1
in an interview with @entity103 's @entity102 , she said @entity95 was using satire , while @entity71 was blasting those who disagree with him			1
but anyone who can read or listen could hear limbaugh calling folks he disagrees with the same			0
@entity3 even went further , agreeing with @entity95 that liberals are " kooks			1
" so @entity71 and @entity95 used the word " retard " to describe folks they disagree with , but only @entity71 was wrong ? yep , that 's how it is in @entity3 's world			1
the advocate for the mentally challenged was quick to pounce on someone she disagrees with politically but defended her patron saint , @entity118			0
@entity3 , when you hold yourself up as a fierce protector of the mentally challenged , politics should n't enter into the equation			1
either you criticize everyone who uses a word that you consider a slur , or you come across as a crass politician who is afraid to offend your chief booster			2
maybe you ought to listen to your spokeswoman , @entity130 , who thought you cared about the mentally challenged when she sent this e-mail to @entity133 about @entity95 's comment : " gov. @entity3 believes crude and demeaning name - calling at the expense of others is disrespectful			1
" but knowing that would n't sit well with @entity118 , you backed off and gave him cover			0
if you were true to your cause , you would have demanded an on - air apology from @entity95 and scolded him for using the word			1
instead , you showed your true colors			0
@entity3 , i have n't bought into your fake " i 'm - a - real - @entity4 " persona			2
you slam the president for using teleprompters , but write crib notes on your hand to remember basic beliefs that should be easy to regurgitate			1
you decry the " lamestream " media , but you bask in its glory and have joined its payroll as a @entity103 contributor , even having the network build a studio in your home			1
you give a speech riddled with falsehoods about the president and national security , and then try to shrug them off as the " lamestream " media attacking you			2
you do n't fool me , even as your legion of fans considers you the second coming of president @entity170			2
you quit on the people who elected you to become a political celebrity , which your presidential running mate blasted then - sen. @entity72 for doing			2
you had the opportunity to show everyone that you 're willing to take on anyone who crosses the line against those who are mentally challenged , and you failed			0
please , make as much money as you can			0
paraphrasing comedian @entity183 , ride this train until the wheels fall off			0
but please , cut the crap			0
you 're a crass politician with no true conviction			0
your actions have shown that			0
the opinions in this commentary are solely those of @entity192 .			2

@entity192 : @entity3 's falsity shown by her different reactions to use of " retard "
@entity192 : president @entity72 's chief of staff uses word , and @entity3 demands his resignation
@entity95 calls liberals " retards , " and @entity3 defends him , @entity192 writes
@entity192 : she slams teleprompters but uses crib notes ; she hates media but works for @entity103
