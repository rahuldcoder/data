-- we are all sick at heart to witness the unfathomable suffering in @entity4			1
why do bad things happen to innocent people ? why @entity4 , again ? even secretary of state @entity7 said recently , " it is biblical , the tragedy that continues to stalk @entity4 and the @entity4 people			1
" how we make meaning of this suffering will be crucial to how we respond , in the long term , as a global community			2
my @entity4 in - laws , visiting from @entity17 , @entity18 , to take some comfort with us , announced that the verse of the day on their favorite @entity22 web site is from @entity24 16:18			1
" and there were voices and thunders and lightnings ; and there was a great earthquake , such as has not been since men were upon the earth , so mighty an earthquake and so great			2
" the word " earthquake " appears sixteen times in the @entity22			2
it was clear to them -- and many other @entity39 -- that the earthquake was part of @entity43 's plan			1
why @entity43 ordains such disasters is a mystery that is not ours to question			2
it is only our job to have faith			2
@entity51 : looking for loves ones in @entity4 a friend who barely escaped the collapse of her house in the quake writes that people in her @entity59 neighborhood are living this time as the apocalypse			1
they are gathering en masse , singing hymns and praying nonstop as they wait for disaster aid -- and @entity64			0
for them , the meaning of their suffering is clear			2
how else to interpret the collapse of their entire world , earthquake , famine , death , disease and drought ? they are @entity43 's children living out the last chapter of the @entity22			1
fundamentalist @entity79 says that the earthquake is the devil 's work			1
haitians are cursed by a pact with @entity85 that their ancestors made , he says			0
distorting a @entity4 national myth , he is referring to a famous @entity90 religious service said to have sparked and launched the @entity91 in 1791			1
ironically , historians tell us that such a single ceremony never happened -- although surely there were many slave gatherings , and many @entity90 religious rituals in the region			0
@entity4 do not mistake @entity100 religiosity for @entity101 as @entity79 does , so for them the ceremony was a spiritually charged political rally			1
slaves gathered to plan and inspire themselves for the outrageous feat they would succeed in performing : a slave revolution , the abolition of slavery , and by 1804 , national independence			0
@entity90 religion , known as @entity112 , still underpins the philosophy of many @entity4 , though by no means everyone			1
a spirit - priest i know reads the earthquake as an allegorical message from the spirits who infuse the land			2
" the land is our mother , " he said			0
when you abuse the land -- deforest her , plant only one crop , overpopulate her , erode her soil -- she explodes , searching for a way to rebalance			0
the spirit of the land had become sick with abuse			0
her children -- the eldest ones , the ones in charge , the @entity4 government -- had no policies , no laws to protect the land or use it wisely			1
the spirit - mother exploded with fever			0
" we know this has a scientific cause , " said the spirit - priest			0
" but look how the government buildings caved in			0
" in the last several years there has been a saying among @entity4 that " the country is finished			1
" " @entity151 , " they say in @entity150			0
it has been called a dying land , a failed state , a product of irreversible environmental degradation			1
for social scientists , there is nothing metaphysical about the question " why @entity4 ? " longstanding structural reasons have produced a dysfunctional system long in crisis			1
beginning as a @entity166 slave society , the nation was founded at a severe disadvantage			2
@entity166 demanded enormous payment for abandoned property after the revolution , starting a cycle of debt that was never broken			0
deep and abiding racism prevented the @entity174 and @entity175 from recognizing @entity4 for 60 years			1
@entity176 was never established on even terms			0
the military ruled the state , culminating in the brutal @entity181 dictatorship , which the @entity174 supported			0
no robust civil society developed -- there 's no vigorous tradition of ptas and town planning boards			2
a brain drain evacuated top talent from the country , while the @entity174 - subsidized farm industry sent surplus crops to @entity4 , undercutting local prices there			1
farmers abandoned their lands , flocked to the capital , and built the shanty towns that have now collapsed into rubble , burying the innocent and vulnerable , strong and powerful alike			0
the suffering @entity4 are enduring is a natural disaster worsened by human - made conditions			1
it is a spiritual crucible			0
but it is also a crisis of meaning			0
for @entity39 it is to have faith , hope , and charity			0
for fundamentalist protestants , it is to convert all souls , give aid , and wait for @entity64 ' return			0
for @entity214 , it is to regain balance with the land and the unseen spiritual world			0
for many social scientists , it is to strengthen @entity4 ' capacity for self - government , to relieve the debt @entity4 owes , to reforest the land , and to figure out how to divorce aid from dependence			1
how we interpret the suffering of the good people of @entity4 will lay the groundwork for how we walk forward			1
the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of @entity231 .			2

@entity4 has endured *extraordinary* suffering , @entity231 says
she says the nation 's different faiths view the suffering *differently*
some view the earthquake as a sign of the @entity242 , she says
social scientists offer answers based on history , racism , environmental degradation
