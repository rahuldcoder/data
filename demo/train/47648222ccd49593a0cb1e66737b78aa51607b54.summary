-- @entity1 is still making digital products , and @entity4 readers are here to stay			1
file these two facts in your " things that may surprise you " folder			0
the book retailer confirmed the first fact on wednesday by introducing a completely redesigned @entity14 e-reader			1
the new ultra-light e-ink - based product arrived just weeks after @entity17 introduced its newest @entity19 e-reader , confirming the second fact			2
purpose - built devices such as the @entity22 and @entity23 clearly have a place in the tablet world , and while neither @entity1 nor @entity17 divulge its e-reader sales , it 's clear that both companies are fully committed to the category , and customers are still buying them			1
a new - look nook in fact , not only are the two retailers committed , they continue to innovate			2
like the @entity19 before it , @entity1 ' new e-reader features an updated 6 - inch @entity4 display with 62 % more pixels on the screen than the previous @entity39 with @entity22 ; this improves text clarity and contrast			1
@entity1 also improved the e-reader 's led - based light source to make light coverage more uniform over the page			1
while @entity17 puts the light source just below the bottom edge of the screen , those on the @entity22 were clearly visibly from just above the top edge			0
overall , i 'd say the @entity22 screen looks quite good ; the contrast and lighting is comparable to what you 'd find on a @entity19			0
with the exception of its shape , @entity1 's new @entity22 looks almost nothing like its predecessor			1
the original @entity61 with @entity22 is black and gray , and includes a power / sleep button on the back			0
the updated e-reader is mostly white and off - white , and has a subtly curved soft - touch back , as well as a wraparound silicon edge			2
the most remarkable change , though , is its weight			0
the @entity22 weighs just 6.2 ounces ; that makes it more than an ounce lighter than the @entity23 â € ” and it 's a noticeable difference			1
@entity1 worked on the software to reduce page - turn flashes to zero within books , and cut down on ghosting			1
this held up during a brief demonstration , but we 'll have to wait for a review unit to see if if the e-reader 's performance remains consistent			2
what 's more , the company worked with @entity85 to create four new fonts , including @entity87 and @entity88 ; they looked quite sharp onscreen			2
storage space has now doubled to @entity91 for the $ 119 model			1
@entity17 's @entity19 also costs $ 119 ( as long as you accept sleep - state ads ) , but comes with just @entity95			1
of course , books do n't eat up a lot of space			0
the @entity22 can accommodate roughly 2,000 books , while the @entity23 can hold roughly 1,100 books			1
@entity1 is also trying to bring the retail experience to its nook devices			2
last year , the company introduced curated shopping options on its @entity105 ; that experience has been recreated on the @entity22 in its @entity108 section			0
according to @entity111 , @entity1 's executive vice-president of digital content and marketing , their customers already rely on the retailer 's 40,000 booksellers at its 14,000 locations for in - person buying advice			1
the curated recommendations on the @entity22 come from those same booksellers			0
" they 've taken it as an opportunity to get more avant - garde and unique in thinking and approach , " @entity111 said			0
despite its reduced size and improved light and page - turn performance , the @entity22 's battery life is still rated at eight weeks			0
your mileage may vary depending on how long you use the light and how often you access @entity133 to buy books through the device			0
@entity1 started selling the new @entity14 on wednesday			1
the company will continue to sell the @entity39 e-reader for $ 79			2
@entity1 's future despite making some great products , @entity1 has struggled to compete in the tablet space			1
there have been corporate shuffles			0
@entity111 , whose background is in digital publishing ( @entity145 ) and water ( @entity147 ) , joined the company in september			0
when i asked about @entity1 's survival and commitment to digital hardware , he kept smiling , but answered firmly : " we 're here and we 're strong			1
" the company is profitable in its retail and college business , @entity111 said , adding that millions of users are moving to digital platforms			0
" we 're definitely committed to the device business , and you 'll see us continue to innovate on all platforms over time			0
there will be more devices			0
