they met a daring cliff jumper			1
they followed the path of religious pilgrims			0
they negotiated with a road - blocking elephant			2
and then a team of @entity10 - based cinematophers on a two - week road trip through @entity12 produced a three - minute memoir of their trip that ranks as the most " i wan na go there ! " videos we 've seen in a while			1
" we all have @entity12 backgrounds and as we were growing up , we heard many stories from our parents about their childhoods in @entity12 , " says @entity20 , co-founder of @entity22 - based @entity21 and @entity23			1
together with @entity21 co-founder @entity29 and assistant @entity30 , the team has traveled often to @entity12 to film destination weddings for private clients			1
but they 'd never ventured beyond the tourist areas or towns in which they were paid to film			0
on their latest trip , however , the group decided to hop in a minivan and go on a " very spontaneous and completely unplanned trip			2
" " we decided that for this work trip , we would set aside some time for ourselves to experience what life in @entity12 is like , " says @entity20			1
they got that and more -- as the video above illustrates -- as @entity20 explained to @entity48			2
@entity48 : what are your favorite scenes in the video ? @entity20 : the elephants on the road is an interesting scene [ 0:20 ]			1
some of the wild elephants in @entity12 are accustomed to blocking the road until they 're fed. feeding wild animals is not permitted , but many people will throw food for the elephants so they eat and move on			1
another scene is the man cliff - jumping [ 0:22 , 1:58 ] , which was breathtaking and frightening at the same time			1
he jumped with such ease then climbed back up the cliff without any support and was ready to jump again			2
@entity48 : what 's the cliff jumper 's story ? @entity20 : the cliff - jumping scene was shot at @entity72 near the @entity73			1
he introduced himself as @entity74 -- short for @entity75 , his family name			0
according to @entity74 , he makes a living out of it and has been doing the jumps for a very long time now			2
he jumps off the cliff for the amusement of tourists , usually for a small fee , around 1,000 rupees ( $ 7 )			1
there 's a rock that juts out so the jump has to be precise , adding to the suspense			0
@entity48 : who 's the solo dancer at the beginning and end of the video ? @entity20 : she 's @entity94 , a 23 - year - old who has been dancing for 10 years			1
@entity20 's an accomplished dancer and dance instructor in the seaside town of @entity97 who has completed her arangetram ( an important stage debut )			0
we featured her at the start and end , performing @entity106 ( @entity105 ) @entity108 " @entity111 " dance , the classical @entity12 @entity109 dance from the hill city , @entity109			1
@entity48 : what 's the great looking festival that pops up ? @entity20 : at almost the one - minute mark an elephant adorned in fancy garments is paraded through the street for @entity118			1
this is one of the biggest celebrations in @entity12 and a pilgrimage for @entity12			1
thousands of people show up , some walking for days to make it to @entity125 , which was a major capital of an ancient kingdom called @entity127			0
we filmed on the final night , which included performances by up to 50 separate dance troupes , highlighting various dance traditions in @entity12			2
@entity48 : how about the tea plantations ? @entity20 : the tea plantations are in @entity135 , a two - to thee - hour drive from @entity137			1
the region is the premium tea plantation area due to its cold , foggy climate			0
they actually belong to different companies that have been around since the @entity144 colonial period , with only little stumps and markers separating different plantations			0
it has a very @entity150 and colonial feel , and used to be called @entity151			0
@entity48 : any tips for photographing @entity12 ? @entity20 : smile			2
if you smile at someone when filming them , this usually puts them at ease			0
@entity12 are very welcoming and tolerant , usually they have no issue with being filmed or photographed			2
it 's also appreciated if you show them the photographs or clips			0
this might lead to further opportunities to film more closely or do a re-take of something important you may have missed			0
@entity48 : what were the challenges ? @entity20 : the best way to get around is driving , but the roads are n't well developed in some areas			0
there 's lengthy travel time even for short distances			0
unexpected traffic also causes missed moments like sunsets or sunrises			0
getting permission at various venues can sometimes take a lot of effort and communication .			0
