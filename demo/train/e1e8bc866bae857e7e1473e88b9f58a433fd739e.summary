-- a federal judge ruled wednesday that @entity3 's abortion law , considered one of the most restrictive in the nation , is unconstitutional			1
the law banned most abortions after six weeks , when a fetal heartbeat can be first detected			1
" the @entity3 strict ban on abortions at the time when a ' heartbeat ' has been detected -- essentially banning all abortions as early as six weeks of pregnancy -- can not withstand a constitutional challenge , " @entity10 district judge @entity9 wrote in his decision			1
" a woman 's constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before viability has been recognized by the @entity23 for more than 40 years			1
the @entity23 has clearly determined the dispositive issue presented in this lawsuit			2
this court is not free to impose its own view of the law			0
" the law , thought to be the nation 's toughest anti-abortion measure , was signed by the state 's governor last year			1
" although the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question , this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of @entity43 , " gov. @entity34 said then			2
he called the constitutionality of the law " an open question , " saying the @entity23 has never considered the " precise restriction " of the fetal heartbeat aspect			1
the governor was not immediately available to comment on wednesday 's decision			2
the @entity51 cheered the ruling			0
" the court was correct to call this law exactly what it is : a blatant violation of the constitutional guarantees afforded to all women			0
but women should not be forced to go to court , year after year in state after state , to protect their constitutional rights			2
" we hope today 's decision , along with the long line of decisions striking down these attempts to choke off access to safe and legal abortion services in the @entity10 , sends a strong message to politicians across the country that our rights can not be legislated away , " said @entity65 , that group 's president and ceo			1
the ruling was also praised by the director of the @entity81 women 's clinic , the only clinic providing abortions in @entity3			1
" the decision is a sigh of relief for us and the women we serve			0
it 's not a surprise			0
we fully expected the decision to go our way but it 's always nice when it finally happens , " said @entity90			0
abortion was legalized in all 50 states in 1973 by the @entity10 @entity23			1
statutory time limits on when abortions can take place , however , vary from state to state			0
under @entity43 , abortions are generally permitted until the fetus is considered viable , or able to live outside the womb			0
some states have no time limit , while others allow abortion up to the end of the second trimester , about 27 or 28 weeks into the pregnancy			0
