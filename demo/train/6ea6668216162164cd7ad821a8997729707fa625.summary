-- the revelation from @entity3 's girlfriend that he had stopped taking an antidepressant a few weeks before his rampage at @entity6 has reopened debate about whether the drug can cause violent behavior			1
@entity10 told @entity0 that she had seen no hint during their two - year courtship that the 27 - year - old might be capable of killing five people and injuring 17 before committing suicide			0
@entity3 had stopped taking @entity16 three weeks before his shooting spree on february 14 and had been taking two other medications , she said			1
experts differ on whether @entity16 and other similar antidepressants might be linked to violence			1
" there 's very little likelihood that withdrawal from @entity16 could , by itself , cause someone to become violent , said dr. @entity26 , professor of psychiatry at @entity28 and president - elect of the @entity30			1
if people with other psychiatric illnesses had a propensity to violence , then discontinuing drug use " could make them irritable , and that could be one trigger , " said @entity26 , who has accepted speaking fees from the drug industry , but not in recent years			1
but , she said , " discontinuation syndrome " does not cause someone to become violent			0
" we understand that tragic and frightening events make people desperate for explanations , " she said in an e-mail			2
" the explanations are seldom simple or straightforward , and , especially when attempts to understand would intrude on the confidentiality of medical records , we seldom know enough about perpetrators ' lives and minds to determine just what caused their behaviors			0
" she added , " we have much , much more to fear from untreated psychiatric illnesses than from the effects of psychiatric medication			0
" dr. @entity58 , research professor of psychiatry at the @entity60 , agreed			0
" in general , there is no evidence at all of these drugs producing increases in violence , " he told @entity0			2
" if anything , it was a withdrawal effect			2
" @entity58 , the former director of the @entity68 and host of @entity71 's " @entity70 , " said he tells his medical residents " until i 'm blue in the face " to change doses gradually rather than abruptly			0
" you taper up , you taper down , " he said			0
@entity76 -- the @entity78 ' version of the @entity79 -- changed its labeling in 2004 for the class of antidepressants to warn that " patients of all ages taking these drugs may experience behavioral and / or emotional changes that may put them at increased risk of self - harm or harm to others			1
" and a medication guide approved by the @entity79 warns of the possibility that users could act " aggressive , being angry , or violent			1
" the labeling also cites concern over " thoughts of suicide " and " anxiety , agitation , panic attacks , difficulty sleeping , irritability , hostility , aggressiveness , impulsivity , restlessness , or extreme hyperactivity			0
" labeling in both countries warns patients not to stop taking the medication abruptly			2
@entity10 did not say whether @entity3 stopped taking @entity16 abruptly or whether he consulted with his psychiatrist prior to doing so			1
an increased risk of violence occurs around the time of dose transition , according to the @entity79			1
dose transition is when a person who begins taking an antidepressant changes dose or stops taking it , said dr. @entity120 of the @entity121 of @entity122 at @entity123			2
@entity16 , which has been available in the @entity124 for more than 20 years , is one of a class of drugs called selective serotonin re-uptake inhibitors			1
they increase the accumulation in the brain of the chemical messenger serotonin , which is linked to feelings of well - being			0
though researchers have compiled the most data about @entity137 , another antidepressant in the same class of medications , there is " no reason to think @entity16 is any different , " since all the drugs in that class work the same way , said the @entity146 psychiatrist and author of " @entity148			1
" in the case of @entity16 , because of its long half - life , the problems are likely to come several weeks after the last dose , " said @entity120 , who has been critical of the drugs and has testified as an expert witness on both sides of the matter			1
though millions of people take antidepressants , researchers have had a hard time disentangling the many variables that affect behavior to determine whether the drugs are associated with episodes of violence			2
but that alone does n't explain the scant data			2
a study published last month in the @entity167 and carried out by researchers at the @entity169 found that the results of almost a third of antidepressant studies were never published , and nearly all of those had concluded that the drug did not work			0
" not only were positive results more likely to be published , but studies that were not positive , in our opinion , were often published in a way that conveyed a positive outcome , " concluded the authors , led by @entity169 's dr. @entity177			0
" by altering the apparent risk - benefit ratio of drugs , selective publication can lead doctors to make inappropriate prescribing decisions that may not be in the best interest of their patients and , thus , the public health , " they concluded			2
@entity120 himself wrote one study that did get published , in @entity194 in september 2006			0
it tallied the overall risk of violence among more than 9,000 antidepressant users at 0.65 percent , more than twice the 0.31 percent seen among people who were taking placebo			2
but @entity120 cautioned against concluding that there was indeed a causal relationship between the drug and @entity3 's outburst			1
" while the data shows the drugs can pose a real risk , in each individual case you still have to look closely for alternate explanations and definitely not assume too quickly that it has been the drug , " he said			1
see a professor talk about @entity3 's demeanor leading up to the shooting Â» @entity10 's assertion to @entity0 that @entity3 was also taking @entity216 , an anti-anxiety agent , and @entity218 , a sleep aid , before the @entity6 shootings , make establishing a causal relationship even more difficult , said psychiatrist @entity26			1
it is not unusual for doctors to prescribe anti-anxiety agents and sleep medication along with antidepressants , since they can cause anxiety and interfere with sleep , she said			0
but , she added , " the more things you add , the more unpredictable things can get			0
" dr. @entity232 , a clinical instructor in psychiatry at @entity235 who has given expert testimony in cases against the pharmaceutical industry , raised concerns about the drug combination @entity10 said her boyfriend was taking			2
prozac withdrawal can make a person irritable and aggressive , and @entity218 and @entity216 each can cause a person to shed inhibitions , according to the @entity79 's drug labeling			1
the result " could be a pretty deadly combination , " said @entity232 , author of " the @entity251 - a step - by - step guide to safely overcoming withdrawal , @entity250 , and ' addiction			0
" he called for " some governmental organization " to investigate whether anecdotal reports of violence linked to the drugs are backed up by hard data			1
a spokesman for @entity16 drug maker @entity260 said the cause of the killing spree may remain elusive			1
" there is much information that is still unknown about his life and medical history and therefore it may never be known as to why he ultimately chose to take the lives of others as well as himself , " said spokesman @entity263 , in an e-mail			0
" because the authorities have not confirmed at this time any use of a specific medication by this young man , it is not appropriate for us to speculate on the matter			0
it 's important that patients should not stop taking any medication without first talking with their doctor			0
" e-mail to a friend			0

girlfriend : @entity3 stopped taking @entity16 three weeks before @entity6 shooting
most experts say there is little data to provide link between drugs , violence
@entity79 : prozac withdrawal can make a person irritable and aggressive
other drug *interactions* make it difficult to conclude whether a link exists
