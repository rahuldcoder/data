-- passing earwax - tainted earbuds between friends is nobody 's favorite way to share @entity6 tunes			2
an integrated speaker in the smaller @entity6 nano and @entity6 shuffle models could end that practice for good , and provide opportunity for a host of new @entity6 possibilities			1
a newly published @entity15 patent describes how @entity15 could add a teeny speaker dome to the clip on the @entity6 shuffle or @entity6 nano			1
it 's a sneaky way to add some extra functionality to @entity15 's smallest media players -- all without adding any extra bulk			2
according to the patent , which was broken down by @entity15 , the addition of a speaker would be a " natural evolutionary step for their media players			1
" the addition of a speaker -- along with @entity15 's embrace of the @entity34 as a wrist - worn device and the integration of nike + exercise software -- would also position @entity15 well for targeting the same fitness market that 's home to the @entity40 , @entity30 analyst @entity29 says			1
over the past two years , several signs have pointed to one or more @entity6 lines being discontinued			0
indicators include lackluster sales ( last quarter , @entity15 sold 6.6 million ipods , a 27 percent decline from the same period in 2010 ) , and a dearth of product refreshes for the shuffle and classic models			2
nonetheless , @entity15 continues to support its beloved line of media players			2
and now it seems new energy may be breathed into the line			0
ceo @entity56 said @entity6 is a " large and important product " for the company at @entity15 's 2011 @entity59 event			1
and @entity15 recently dropped the prices of its nano and touch @entity6 models , making them more competitive and more accessible to a wider market			1
current iterations of the nano and shuffle have no external speaker , but the larger @entity6 does have one			1
the @entity6 nano - like @entity40 , a wearable fitness - tracking music player			2
@entity29 sees the addition of a speaker to , say , an @entity34 as a gateway to a slew of new use - case scenarios			0
" one thing it might point to is the nano being used to interface with an @entity89 device , " @entity29 says , much the way the @entity40 can sync with an @entity79 device , and be used to relay the arrival of calls or text messages on its small screen			0
@entity29 says future nanos could be worn on your wrist , displaying social media updates relayed from an @entity94 stowed away in your backpack or messenger bag			1
a nano with a small speaker could also feature an audible alarm , making timed work - out tracking all the more convenient -- useful when you want to use @entity102 + without earbuds			0
@entity29 also points out that you could activate @entity105 requests using the small screen on your wrist and have answers relayed to you through the speaker			0
if the speaker only ended up being used as a music playback mechanism , @entity29 says , " it would n't make a radical difference " in how we use or perceive @entity45			0
true , but not needing to share earbuds anymore ? still a plus			0
